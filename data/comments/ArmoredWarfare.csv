ArmoredWarfare,3e3mxr,OfensiveBias,4,Tue Jul 21 18:26:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thoughts! I'll pass this on to the developers.
ArmoredWarfare,3e3mxr,my_freitag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:28 2015 UTC,Float the idea of having the BMP-2M as tier 6 and bump up the BMP-3 and BMP-3M one tier :)
ArmoredWarfare,3e3mxr,yosp,2,Wed Jul 22 01:51:13 2015 UTC,"The BMP-3 is definitely underwhelming, especially when compared to the BMP-2 before it and the equal tiered Terminator, which has good armor and gun depression. The BMP-3 doesn't bring anything to the table that the BMP-2 doesn't."
ArmoredWarfare,3e3mxr,GrassWaterDirtHorse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"It's a downgrade for sure. I've got all upgrades (apart from the engine, which I assume has bugged stats). I've got a 30% win rate when I had a 55% win rate in the BMP-2. I hate it. I also think the BMP-3M will be a massive let down so I'm not very motivated to grind this line anymore.  My additional suggestions to yours; buff the HP so it's not a 2-shot-kill for most opponents it faces, maybe 1500HP. Buff the 100mm RoF, from 8/9 seconds to 6/7. Let it carry more than 10 missiles. The BMP-2 carries a ton of them but the BMP-3 is limited to just ten. Buff the BMP-3M so it'll also be competitive for it's tier. Also add a tier 8 vehicle to the line that kicks ass so we have a reason to suffer the grind.  edit. also buff its view range. It's a more modern machine than the BMP-2, and is taller, but has worse view range. What gives?!"
ArmoredWarfare,3e46u1,Crisis7,2,Tue Jul 21 20:43:26 2015 UTC,"I have heard on good authority that the warrior is getting an ammo increase. it actually carries 250 rounds, and in game it only has 120. we may not be getting the full 250, but we should see an improvement."

ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,Whitedeath5,2,Tue Jul 21 10:51:25 2015 UTC,"Hey Freitag. I am just curious, since the tiers are being redone, is a wipe being planned for early access 4? I would really like to know!  Thank you in advance."
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,my_freitag,3,Tue Jul 21 16:37:04 2015 UTC,"There will most likely be a soft wipe. We're watching how things go with the soft wipe on RU and will be making adjustments if necessary, but with the changes coming up, you're right that a wipe will almost certainly be necessary."
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,Hotblack_Desiato_,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:08 2015 UTC,"Could you please explain ""soft wipe?"""
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,Whitedeath5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"I can imagine that we will be removed of our tanks and possibly compensated by the xp/credits we used to buy and upgrade those tanks.  They will reset our trees but compensate us, so we will be back at the tiers of tank we used. For instance, I use the Wiesel. What Obsidian will do is refund me all the xp/credits I used to get the wiesel, but not actually give me back the wiesel in early access 4, since its being moved up a tier.  However, this is just speculation."
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,my_freitag,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:39 2015 UTC,"More or less this is the idea. I'm not 100% sure how we'll do it, but that's the intention."
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,Whitedeath5,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:01 2015 UTC,I understand things need a bit more planning but thanks for clarifying! I think that would be the best way to do it- it allows us to still test the higher tier tanks while testing the new lower tier tanks as well.  Thanks for the answer Freitag! Nice to have a CM as active in the community as you.
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,Hotblack_Desiato_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:54:00 2015 UTC,"Since you're here and answering questions, I'll ask one.  Is there any possibility of some degree of unifying progress across server zones come launch? I like playing with people from all over, and I can't always play at peak times for play in my zone. I'm quite sure I'm not alone in these concerns.  I realise that total unification would entail some economic loss, so what about unification of launch pack and non-premium progress only?"
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,my_freitag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure we have any plans for that at the moment. Is it a possibility? Sure, but I can't make any promises. It's something we're acutely aware of, though, and I'll bring it up again with the team.  As a thought experiment though, what do you think of some HYPOTHETICAL (just so we're clear here :P) half-way points to unified progress:   A percentage of progress is transferred to the other region You can pay an extra X% on top of a purchase to get a Premium tank and have it be available in both regions   or something like that? I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts."
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,Hotblack_Desiato_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"Totally fine on both counts, providing of course, the percentages (in either or both cases) are reasonable for both parties."
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,yosp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"Why not just have one universal account and have the option to queue for either the NA server or EU server or both?    I believe that Warthunder's queue system is a good example of this.    Is this something that is feasible? Or are they separated by design?    It's a good idea, but I could definitely see many players turned off to this if they have to take a step back in their progress in order to play on a different server."
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,illusionalsagacity,0,Tue Jul 21 19:09:08 2015 UTC,EA4 will be deployed when it is ready. Would you rather wait with no AW or be able to play the game?
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,darkknightxda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:45 2015 UTC,fair enough.   I'm just kinda bored of EA3 since its just me endlessly grinding my T80/Stringray 2.  Just hoping it comes soon

I've talked to Jinxx about it, and we both agreed that 24 hour servers would isolate the community too much. It's possible for EU, but then people on NA who don't realize this would be mad and then there'd be a whole lotta drama (and nobody wants that)."
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,RickR13,3,Mon Jul 20 17:49:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind if they unified the servers and put them on the US east coast. I play US from Germany when I'm up late and the ping isn't so bad that it would kill my experience.
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,CirnoNewsNetwork,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"Thats quite annoying. Why is NA so low populated, while the devs are American, if I could ask?"
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,yosp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:39 2015 UTC,Eu servers are up earlier for people in the US. It's easier to deal with the slightly worse ping for more convenient times to play.
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,Gatortribe,0,Mon Jul 20 18:43:12 2015 UTC,"How would extending server hours cause ""a whole lotta drama""? There's already 24 hour weekends, and I have yet to witness any drama related to it. My point is, there's already high demand hours and low demand hours on the weekends, so what's the problem with having that during the weekday?"
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,CaptainKapautz,0,Mon Jul 20 20:36:51 2015 UTC,"24 hour servers means NA population dies. Only EU could survive 24 hour servers. So logically we would make EU the only 24 hour server, but those who don't realize NA would get very long queue time would be up in arms."

ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,xDarkCrisis666x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:43 2015 UTC,"24 hour servers means NA population dies.     Why? There's literally no reason that EU should get certain benefits that NA doesn't get. Sure NA population is lower than EU, but that's a BS reason to not allow 24 hour server time. East coast and west coast players operate on completely different times, so this restricts players on the NA server. As far as players not realizing that the servers are up 24 hours, that's Obsidian/my.com's job to communicate that to players. So why should players suffer because of a lack of communication?"
ArmoredWarfare,3dylxo,Grummond,2,Mon Jul 20 22:30:35 2015 UTC,"I play east coast, and I get similar ping to EU and NA. I play NA because my friends play NA, and because the times don't line up. but if EU has a significantly higher population during the times that I play, it becomes very tempting to switch as more people means more functional mm."

ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,pyrosity,11,Mon Jul 20 15:28:29 2015 UTC,Definitely a fan of this feature. I could picture in-game loot being:    -Reputation earning boosts -Credit earning boosts -Camos -Vehicle emblems    -Retrofits -Base customizations -Gold/Credits    Etc..
ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,yosp,3,Mon Jul 20 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"They could potentially add a very interesting mechanic between the loot and retrofit mechanic.  Say if you kill a vehicle that's higher tier than your own, it has a chance of dropping a retrofit for you, depending on what vehicle you killed.  Now that would be interesting."
ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,Razgriz01,5,Mon Jul 20 20:18:28 2015 UTC,"The auction house idea is interesting!   Fuck no. Look at the epic fail that occurred on Diablo III.  If this isn't ""pay to win"" then what the hell is it?"

An auction house item that gives your vehicle a special, rare camo pattern that has similar in-game bonuses to the regular camo most players unlock in the retrofit system (or wherever camo will be)....that sounds interesting.  It depends on how they implement it."
ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,bspooky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:24:10 2015 UTC,"I could see purely aesthetic items being loot.  Could be things like enemy helmets or skulls, camo netting, additional crew mg, jerry cans.  They could also somehow implement it into the crew skills/slots, i.e. looted a enemy gas mask, takes 1 of X crew loot slots and provides a very menial +.5 to X skill.  This way there is some benefit but not enough to really be considered OP."
ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,VexatiousOne,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:00:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this will be good, but I'm glad they're trying it. This game needs more things to make it come out from WOT's shadow. It really needs to innovate."
ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,Trucidar,2,Mon Jul 20 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"It needs to focus on PvE imo. For PvP it suffers from the same issue as the other vehicle games: the players. While in PvP everybody is selfish and tends to heard together, in PvE you all strive for the same goal and I feel it's a lot more of a team effort."
ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,Ketadine,0,Tue Jul 21 05:27:18 2015 UTC,"Loot is coming soon, possibly in the next test, or open beta. I hope there will also be rare chances of winning a special premium vehicle through loot. These should be randomly awarded after battles are finished."
ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,goldmaster11,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:54 2015 UTC,"I think loot is going to be more of a PVE thing than a PVP thing. From the last Dev Dispatch:   …the PvE will move more towards “World of Warcraft” than “PvP with bots” I believe. I mean, if you want to play hard, smart opponents, why play with bots when you have the PvP mode? That’s the theory anyway. ~SilentStalker, Content Manager"
ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,Autoxidation,-2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:14 2015 UTC,I'd like this feature implemented as a reward to players who take down a vehicle class using the correct ammunition type. This would challenge players to assess the threat prior to the countdown reaching zero. Spot an enemy and killing him with the corresponding anmunition that is developed. Eg. Mbt = sabot. Light armored vehicles  = heat     trucks etc Heat/HE.  The player is then rewarded with loot/additional xp/reputation etc. Fight smart.
ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,Peabush,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:25:08 2015 UTC,"""correct ammunition type"" wtf does that even mean....  You realize HE and HEAT is a viable round against more heavily armored targets? ..."
ArmoredWarfare,3dyebo,VexatiousOne,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:54:40 2015 UTC,I operate tanks as a profession. I know the SOP when it comes to selecting the right ammunition to defeat different targets.  Sabot DM53/63 = tanks / heavy armor. HEAT DM12 = apc'/ifv light armor (and trucks). HE DM11= soft or reinforced target.
ArmoredWarfare,3e0zo9,RetroVisionOfficial,9,Tue Jul 21 03:04:46 2015 UTC,"Obsidian wants the progression to be tested as well, not just the vehicles."

ArmoredWarfare,3e0zo9,Ketadine,3,Tue Jul 21 05:42:55 2015 UTC,They're working on progression. They need our feedback on progression. That means we have to earn the tanks. Giving us all the tanks would serve no purpose.   Once they're happy with progression they might start doing the WoT testing thing of giving us a ton of creds and XP to play with.
ArmoredWarfare,3e0zo9,Highw4ySt4r,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:15:14 2015 UTC,I think it will get there eventually. Although when it does it may not be for long before OBT starts.

T-72A, cool....but it looks a lot more like the B model if you ask me, I don't recall the A ever getting ERA.   Something else is it just me or do the lower tier models look more sterile? Like they spent less time on them intentionally, they all seem to look more ""clean"" and ""arcade-ish"". I hope they spend some time adding additional detail to the T1-4 tanks."

That thing is frustrating as shit to play as I miss with it at least 50% more than I do with any other tank in the Wolfi tree. It's such a shock coming off from the LAV-300 I really think the two should be swapped in the tree and call it a day because the LAV-300 is better in almost ever measurable way short the armor upgrade and a bit of pen.

It also contested his own efforts to get free upvotes from being the first to link to patch notes. People agreed with him and downvoted the thread to hell. I disagreed because I saw a significant improvement in the ArmoredLabs version, while still linking to the original.  People disagreed with my opinion, and we left the issue at that. The community voted on the content.    We decided to delay a final decision.  So now we are in the situation where you keep posting articles that are composed of 90% of content from AW.MY.COM, copy-pasted without clear attribution. 4 out of the top 8 articles on your website right now are copy-pastes of AW.MY.COM articles. The tiny ""source"" link at the bottom doesn't change the fact that you are making it seem like the content is yours.   Reddiquette also recommends: ""Feel free to post links to your own content (within reason). But if that's all you ever post, or it always seems to get voted down, take a good hard look in the mirror — you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the 9:1 ratio, i.e. only 1 out of every 10 of your submissions should be your own content.""  If all you want to do on Reddit is advertise your content, you're doing it wrong.  /u/bspooky wrote:   Fifth and final, I actually dislike doing a repost w/o value added content. At times, I have to because of time constraints or there just isn't much, but I don't like doing it. I still do though because I want ArmoredTalk to be a one-stop shop for anyone following AW so visitors don't have to go to the AW news site, check the AW forums, check AL forums, check mail.ru forums, etc. etc. But again, if the posts don't live up to adding much value for you, you can simply elect to ignore the blog.   That is an unacceptably poor cop-out. You shouldn't fill your blog with fluff and expect us to ""take it or leave it"". There is precedent of Subreddits banning sources with bad quality content, even if some of their articles are good.   The choices you leave us are all terrible:   We can implement the Original Sources rule like other subreddits - and it will still require a Case by Case analysis by Moderators on what posts pretend to be OS while aren't, and what is legitimate commentary with quotations. Which is just as arbitrary as not having a rule.  We can (fail to) enforce a quota on the amount of posts coming from ArmoredTalk weekly.  We can restrict you due to Low Quality / Fluff - provide a link to ArmoredTalk on the sidebar under ""blogs"" while adding the site itself to the AutoMod's filter.  ?   It's all stupid meddling in a situation that could have been easily avoided if you weren't so greedy for updates and loose with your standards.   Fuck.

Me calling that out a week or 2 ago never had anything to do with trying to get karma or upvotes from linking AW articles (in 3 weeks i've posted only 4 AW articles, rest being self posts).  I took exception to it because i think linking to the original source helps the game get more coverage than linking to a blog that isn't very transparent about the fact that their content is copy pasted with a few slight changes, I would personally much rather traffic get to the AW site before a blog.  Also the quality of the presentation of the AW articles and Forum links in my opinion is very high which makes believe that reformatting isn't a necessary or significant change."
ArmoredWarfare,3dy0t9,OtterTenet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:31 2015 UTC,"I apologize for the speculation.   I agree with your reasoning, just thought the other situation was an exception."
ArmoredWarfare,3dy0t9,bspooky,0,Tue Jul 21 02:08:32 2015 UTC,"1)  I was not promoting my own stuff in this thread but actually trying to help the OP since I thought that is the standard you had set. And doing so was actually against my own belief for this particular post (see next point). Maybe OffensiveBias shouldn't have confronted the OP if this issue is still up in the air. Since it is, I wouldn't make my comment again.   2) Looking at my current site and the 10 articles on the front, three of them, including the one linked to in this thread, should have reddit links go straight to AW corporate instead of AT IMO. If I had had time to add more stuff, then maybe it'd be different.   But the other 7 of the 10 articles should have links go to AT, I don't see how you can really say otherwise unless there was independent parallel content elsewhere that just looked better.   3) You say 4 of 8 are fluff from AW corporate reposts..the 7 that are not AW corporate nor fluff: Loot article, Premium review by a contributor, Fox/dogfighting funny, Developers digest 21, game notification screens from the RU test...I didn't create the screens no, but showing them in English to the community is value, Retrofit system same thing, technology trees same thing. None of those are from AW corporate portal.   The 3 that are sourced from corporate AW: 1. I mostly paraphrased (except maybe the bullets, but the quote class didn't work for some reason) and added that mortars are also coming based on a quote from a different source than on AW portal, 2. is a repost with a short intro with the repost separated by an HR and a source link at the end that I thought was sufficient, and the other repost has my added comments in a different color in brackets so as not to be confused with their stuff...I could have done a better job with this one for sure as it was rushed.   . . .  P.S. Throwing accusations in a wall of text, especially as a moderator, and then say any response can't be detailed isn't quite above board. Also, in no way do I try to take credit for AW corporate stuff...I thought the HR, source link, and my comments in color were sufficient. At times I may err, but I do not purposefully try to make it look like my own, and you shouldn't be making accusations like that but of course you are free to as much as you want."
ArmoredWarfare,3dy0t9,MadWOPR,0,Tue Jul 21 01:42:27 2015 UTC,"It seems rather dumb to get in pissing matches over content when the sub isn't drowning in awesome posts(multiple people don't like the terminator, we get it), imo"
ArmoredWarfare,3dy0t9,illusionalsagacity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:23:33 2015 UTC,"You added some editorial notes and used wordpress albums to publish the exact same pictures in a slightly different format. All of your links for further information are back to your own blog. Most of your blog's content is pure speculation, with some reposts of dev information."
ArmoredWarfare,3dy0t9,bspooky,0,Mon Jul 20 20:58:38 2015 UTC,"Well first, realize that a few weeks ago somebody else made a post to another site that had a copy/paste of corporate AW content on it. A second party made  a comment very similar to what OfensiveBias made above. That OP didn't understand why the second party said what they did and I tried to be helpful and tell the OP it may have been because the Reddiquette appears to suggest people link to the original source of the material. Paraphrasing this, but I was basically told by a moderator here, Ottertenet, that I (and, therefore, the second party making a similar statement to what OfensiveBias made) was wrong, that the link to the AW content on another site was acceptable because the linked to site had reformatted it in a subjectively better way, and he preferred if the community here determines what posts were popular and what are not. So that, to me, set the standard for this sub. Cool, I have no problems with that. Now fast forward a couple weeks...  Second, realize I didn't want pyrosity feeling like he did something wrong. OfensiveBias, by asking why pyrosity didn't link to the AW site, seemed to imply the he had done something wrong just like the second party did to the OP I mentioned in the point above. Anyway, hopefully, you can see why I responded...I would have responded whether this had been to one of my pages or one of Rita's or anywhere else. Either it is acceptable to link to corporate AW information that has been reformatted or it is not. Plain and simple. Either way is fine by me as long as it is consistent so posters like pyrosity in this thread or whoever the other poster was a few weeks go don't get jumped on. I am happy to help support whichever direction the sub wants, it should just be consistent.   Third, I try not to post my own stuff here unless it is quite a bit different, and I did not post this article here nor would I have talked about this one but this stuff is coming up. So in regards to your comment that the added content on the linked to page being just links to my other page (implying it isn't adding much I assume)...it does add value. Doesn't it make sense when AW is finally announcing what tanks are coming in EA4  to add the tech trees and info about the Russian PTS since AW corporate did not include it? I am not going to recreate that info on every post where it fits, so yes, I linked back to it. Many visitors to the page may have seen it already, but some are new to the blog, new to the content to begin with, and adding in those tech trees and PTS info for those people does help them IMO, but maybe I am wrong.   Fourth, as far as my blog being mostly pure speculation with ""some"" reposts....I'd actually say I have more reposted information than speculation! I do believe that a lot of the information I take from corporate AW has a lot of stuff added by supporting material, though. Anyway, on speculation...I nearly didn't post the article about loot because it was a lot of speculation, and I hope I made that clear in the article. I assume most readers come to the blog because they want known facts, not my speculation. At times, my speculation is a bit more know than pure speculating but I can't share why ...this time with the loot article it was reading the tea leaves. So other than that, I'm not sure why you say ""most"" of my blog is speculation when I rarely have a pure spec article, but maybe our definitions differ on what that looks like.   Fifth and final, I actually dislike doing a repost w/o value added content. At times, I have to because of time constraints or there just isn't much, but I don't like doing it. I still do though because I want ArmoredTalk to be a one-stop shop for anyone following AW so visitors don't have to go to the AW news site, check the AW forums, check AL forums, check mail.ru forums, etc. etc. But again, if the posts don't live up to adding much value for you, you can simply elect to ignore the blog. I'm still having fun doing it, and I think a lot of people get a lot of good information from it.   tl;dr: Hey, all I was trying to do was help so this community is consistent. If you don't think the blog is helpful then no worries, it just isn't for you and you don't have to read it."

ArmoredWarfare,3dy0t9,rteague2566,5,Mon Jul 20 16:19:30 2015 UTC,"Introducing the Early Access 4 Vehicles Early Access 4 will bring numerous changes and rebalances into Armored Warfare as well as new gameplay elements and vehicles. Many of these vehicles can be found on lower tiers and are thus accessible to players from very early on, filling the gaps in the current vehicle branches. These vehicles are:  T-54  The iconic Soviet medium tank, designed in the last days of the Second World War will make appearance in Armored Warfare on tier 2, bridging the gap between PT-76 and T-62. The vehicle introduced into the game is an early model with the classic Soviet weapon, the 100mm D-10T gun.  M48 Patton  This classic early post-war American tank will appear in Armored Warfare on tier 2 in Sophie Wölfli’s main battle tank branch between the M113 and the newly rebalanced rest of the branch. Tier 3 is now split between the Leopard 1 main battle tank and the M60 Patton. The M60A2 “Starship” is no longer a premium vehicle and appears in Armored Warfare on tier 4, as does the Italian OF-40. Powerful and mobile, the M48 Patton is sure to fit well on its tier.  Object 430  This vehicle is actually a predecessor to the T-64. It was built in the fifties by the Soviets to replace the aging T-54/55 medium tank series before it was scrapped. In Armored Warfare this vehicle will be a tier 2 premium main battle tank. Featuring decent armor and a powerful gun, it surely will be more than a match for other vehicles of the same tier.  Object 155  Another attempt to upgrade the T-54 medium tank was the Object 155, a vehicle that would later on become the T-55. It has several upgrades over the T-54 (including WMD protection and an improved engine). The Object 155 is a special vehicle and will not be available as a regular or a premium tank.  Centauro 120  A different version of the wheeled Centauro tank destroyer, this time with a 120mm smoothbore gun. Certainly a powerful tank destroyer, it will appear in Armored Warfare on tier 7 as an alternative to the LAV-600. The LAV-600 will ultimately lead to the M1128 Stryker while the Centauro 120 will lead to Centauro 155 Mod. This vehicle will share its general properties with other Centauro models – a powerful gun but mediocre mobility and armor.  FV721  The “Fox” (as this vehicle is widely known) will appear in Armored Warfare on tier 5 and will be unlocked from the Swingfire. Previous tier 5 vehicle, the VBL, will be shifted to tier 6 and the previously tier 6 Wiesel 1 will be shifted to tier 7. The Fox was built in the seventies as a replacement for the Saladin and Ferret armored cars. Fast, sleek and maneuverable, it will be a very effective scout.  Begleitpanzer 57  The Begleitpanzer 57 was built in the 70’s by Thyssen-Henschel and Bofors using a modified pre-production Marder hull and the Bofors 57mm automatic cannon. The goal was to create a light but well-armed fire support vehicle. It was never mass-produced. In Armored Warfare, the Begleitpanzer 57 will appear as a light tank on tier 5 in Marat Shishkin’s branch, filling the gap between the Sheridan and the Stingray. This branch will be further prolonged by shifting the Scorpion from tier 2 to tier 3 and by putting it before the Sheridan.  T-72A  This enhanced version of the T-72 (featuring many advanced components) will fill the tier 6 gap between tier 5 T-72 and tier 7 T-80 in Marat Shishkin’s MBT branch. It will be better protected than the regular T-72 and there will be mobility and firepower upgrades as well.  We are currently working on filling the progress gaps in existing dealer trees in order to provide the players with the most interesting vehicles possible. There will be more changes and additions in the future.  Stay tuned and see you on the battlefield!"

ArmoredWarfare,3e0cqu,OtterTenet,3,Tue Jul 21 00:15:55 2015 UTC,"Sorry friend, there is never an ETA to Open Beta. Close to New-Year's Eve would be my logical guess.   Obsidian will probably want to tap the holiday season of 2015 without competing with the AAA titles and sales that tend to be released at it's peak.   I hope you get some quality play time on the weekends.  The problem is that many people have tried it earlier and are now holding back, to avoid being burned out before Open Beta.

The start of the next EA phase should bring a lot more people in to test out the new features, just like what happens when patches are released in most free to play games.

You can basically two-shot tier 4 tanks with the MBT70, while they'll have trouble doing much to you.    Don't get me wrong, I like that the higher tiers feel like you're more powerful, but the idea that you have the same ROF as your lower-tiered opponents, but do much more damage per shot, makes getting in games where you're two tiers below people feel very unbalanced.    Hopefully the full release of the game will only allow MM of +- 1 tier rather than 2. (I'd rather keep the alpha damage on the higher tiers)"
ArmoredWarfare,3du0tn,Protuhj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:25:40 2015 UTC,"you have the same ROF as your lower-tiered opponents, but do much more damage per shot   uh, the MBT-70 has a 12.7 second reload. How is that the same RoF as low tiers?"
ArmoredWarfare,3du0tn,Protuhj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, so it's not exactly as fast as lower tiers, but when a normal engagement is:   Poke->Shoot->Hide->Poke->Shoot, that 5 second difference is lessened.      If you can pop out, do 600 damage and hide, without taking a hit, you're going to demolish your lower-tier opponents.    Of course, if you're trying to be a sniper, it isn't as good DPM -- but pure DPM assumes you can fire uninterrupted."
ArmoredWarfare,3du0tn,funyuns4ever,2,Mon Jul 20 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"yes of course the tank with the biggest Alpha wins a peekaboom contest, but a tier 4 LT can easily flank an MBT-70 and kill it taking less damage than against a MBT with a smaller gun.  I'm not trying to argue that the MBT-70 isn't OP, but it is definitely not as clear cut as you are making out"

ArmoredWarfare,3dugys,Colindapieman,5,Sun Jul 19 16:23:39 2015 UTC,What it needs is its hull armor nerfed and the damage from non penetrating HE shells reduced. It's just silly that it can deal out 400+ damage in a few seconds to the front of most MBTs.
ArmoredWarfare,3dugys,Slayer5577,2,Sun Jul 19 16:41:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, getting 300-400 damage frontally on an T6 or T7 MBT is super OP. Not the mention if many of those same MBT's want to pen they have to hit your little turret often for less damage than the term has dished out. IMO weakening the side armor would be vastly helpful in making the tank less OP.  I see term players just sit out in the open at extreme range absorbing and bouncing shots from T4, T5, T6 and T7 vehicles all day every day including ATGM's."

None of the other Premium tanks are remotely as imbalanced as it is. Even the MBT-70, probably the 2nd best premium tank, isn't that strong; decent armor, good mobility, and a powerful gun but low rate of fire and the armor isn't exceptional. I'm pretty certain I saw a quote on Armored Talk saying they want prems to be slightly weaker than average, but I can't find it at the moment."
ArmoredWarfare,3dugys,QuietTank,2,Wed Jul 22 02:19:52 2015 UTC,"Load HEAT and shoot the turret for the time being.   Nerfing the armor would be a silly way to fix it, just lower its HP and make the gun easier to take out."

I have also had entirely too many Non-Pens, on the turret also.  Right now its one of the hardest vehicles to damage, while having the highest DPM."
ArmoredWarfare,3dugys,Tarnsman4Life,0,Sun Jul 19 17:55:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, the Terminator is based on the T-72. In real life, it really has very good survivability, with steel, composite, and ERA combined, that is why it is hard to penetrate from the front, it is based on an MBT's hull. It may really need a nerf. We were promised that the premiums would be balanced, and intended to be weaker than some fully upgraded regular vehicles.  This tank could be really overpowered. It can even fire 4 130mm anti-tank missiles in rapid succession. But I am not in AW's closed beta, and may not be able to see this firsthand in-game, since my computer's GPU isn't strong enough for gaming."
ArmoredWarfare,3dugys,OfensiveBias,2,Sun Jul 19 22:29:57 2015 UTC,The BMPT is based on the T-72 in the same way the the T-90MS is based on the T-72. The only terminators sold were based on the T-90A chassis.

Their ridiculous armour is far more frustrating than their gun/HE spam, It's even worse when your only option is to hit the turret for 250 damage meaning that it can take 5/6 good shots on the turret just to kill the tank when any other AFV would die in 3 maybe 4 shots at most.  I know the side has the same type of Applique skirt that the T-72 has, With 165mm side armour and a 1.70 modifier i've still had shots from Stingray 2 (357mm pen) and shots from the T-80 (477mm pen) come up as no pen on the side of the terminator."
ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,Bluenosedcoop,2,Sat Jul 18 23:15:41 2015 UTC,"I think it is crazy that I cannot pen it from the side with a Sheridan or LAV-300 using HEAT.

ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,Evelyus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:13:43 2015 UTC,"I used HEAT almost exclusively during my time as an LAV-300. I didn't always penn the turret, I'd say it was about 70% penn, 30% no effect, but I could consistently do it.   I'm not saying the Terminator is balanced, I'm just stating how I mostly dealt with them."
ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,Autoxidation,4,Sun Jul 19 21:23:57 2015 UTC,"I do think that the terminators need to be worked on. most of what makes them overpowered stems from bugs and features that need to be reworked.  in my opinion, the three things that makes the terminators overpowered is:   Autocannon HE always does damage, so if you hit a well armored part of the tank you do 4 damage but if you manage to hit a weak area, you can do 23-40 damage. Strange bounces/non penetrations on the turret. The turret on this tank seems to bounce half of the shots that you shoot at it even though it nominally has very thin armor.  Half damage hitboxes extend into areas where they shouldn't. The front of the BMPT has a platform that the turret sits on that extends about a foot above the top of the hull. This is one of the only weak areas of the hull, but it is apparently a turret hitbox and takes half damage. additionally, the lower plate is much stronger than it should be.   I don't know what the dev's stance on autocannon HE is, but nerfing that would go a long way towards making the BMPTs more balanced."
ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,OfensiveBias,3,Sat Jul 18 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think HE always dealing damage is inherently a bad thing. The BMPT's DPM is really high (~6800 compared to the Bradley's 6100). The devs have a lot of little knobs they can turn to reduce this without fundamentally changing the way HE damage works. The autocannons are fine on other AFVs IMO. Reducing the RPM of the BMPT, reducing the mag size,  increasing the reload, or a combination of all three are valid ways to keep the BMPT feeling mostly the same without doing any sledgehammer nerfs."
ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,Autoxidation,2,Sun Jul 19 00:41:11 2015 UTC,"If anything auto cannon HE shouldn't be doing anything to MBT's frontally (Mainly T series or any with a ton of armor)... Also there is a good video of a Bradley Tanker Vet from the Gulf war that fired his Bradley's 25mm at the front of a T-72 and watched his shots bounce off... ""pissing it off""."
ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,WankingWarrior,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:10:31 2015 UTC,"That's simply not an option, We're not playing a simulation here, If they were to do this they might aswell remove AFVs altogether."
ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,Bluenosedcoop,3,Sat Jul 18 23:23:38 2015 UTC,"they should absolutely be able to make mincemeat of an MBT from behind, and damage other vehicles frontally, but the whole point of an MBT is the only things that can take it on frontally is another MBT (or stealth cover TD assholes with bigass guns)"
ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,WankingWarrior,2,Sun Jul 19 00:45:16 2015 UTC,Still... MBT's need a reason to pick them over any other tank. Currently the meta right now is stay invisible half across the map spamming HE auto cannons winning the game. Which I think should be changed if you are sitting half across the map spamming your auto cannon firing from one position you should be spotted. Maybe similar to arty I dunno. (Maybe like after a few shots or so)
ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,theycallhimthestug,2,Sun Jul 19 01:25:04 2015 UTC,"Remove them all together if they can't hold an mbt behind cover just by spamming he at the front of it?   Most of the time you can't return fire because they generally have the view range advantage, and they're more mobile, too. The he spam against the front of mbt's should be fixed."
ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,TheAylius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:34:19 2015 UTC,"The damage rolls are entirely based on armor values. If you shoot lower armor the higher you roll. HE rounds potential rolls have already been nerfed, so it's more leaving other tanks like TD's or other AFV's to be in the anti afv role. Also I believe the higher tier MBT's should just have higher view ranges. The T90 having 310 is just bad."

ArmoredWarfare,3ds1y6,Carrotomo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:01:39 2015 UTC,"The armor makes sense. IIRC they are built on the hull of the T-72, without the turret and heavy autoloader.

They can absolutely decimate lower tiered MBTs by driving up to someone's face and spamming their powerful ATGMs.   Terminators should probably take more module damage to the ammo rack and gun accuracy then they currently do. Perhaps shots to the turret should disable ATGMs and damage the guns more often.

It was indeed scrapped.  The National Battles in the other hand were normal arcade matches in which teams were composed of tanks from a single nation. This idea was also scrapped because there were some really overpowered team setups, like six FV183 tanks destroyers against five WTE100s, and other monstrosities like that.

ArmoredWarfare,3dpz7i,Drozasgeneral,13,Sat Jul 18 08:54:23 2015 UTC,"The premium vehicles in AW are more similar to those in WoT than WT.   They are meant to print money, not to boost the research of other regular vehicles - unless you plan on converting a lot of free RP.   In WoT their other use is training crews to later move them to regular tanks. Making money is useful in both games (  developers stated that high tiers will be really expensive to run just like in WoT ),but crew training and swapping is pointless in AW. The commanders are easy to upgrade and can be put in command of any tank without losing skills.  I'd like to see other features added to premium tanks since the current model imported from WoT is only beneficial to money income, and maybe it's not a good enough reason for some players to buy premium vehicles. A premium account will probably be enough to run high on credits.   This is still Early Access though and i'm sure Obsidian Entertainment will find a way to make premium tanks more appealing to players."

While it's true that War Thunder doesn't suffer much from this problem, the currently scarce RP gain for ground forces reduces the value of premium tanks. Obsidian could include a premium commander with each premium tank. This commander would have bonuses instead of perks, such as a boost in exp and money income. This boosts would be active only when playing a specific branch in that specific dealer. This way players interested in multiple branches would have to buy different vehicles instead of just one. They could also make this bonuses related to tiers, so that buying the cheapest TD or MBT is not enough to grind through the whole branch."
ArmoredWarfare,3dpz7i,VoteRonaldRayGun,3,Sat Jul 18 10:35:31 2015 UTC,"Premium tanks serve a few purposes.  Fun: Premium tanks are often gimmicky and the added credit gain means you'll never worry about credits.  Credit Farm: Bonus credits are excellent, most premium tanks are also quite cheap to run. Play a dozen games in a premium if you ever get into monetary issues. (There are also often non-premium credit farming tanks but they're never quite as good).  Experience Conversion: If you're willing to spend the gold, the bonus experience earned in premium tanks can be converted to free experience. Helps to speed up the grind."

ArmoredWarfare,3dp8w4,CirnoNewsNetwork,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:22:49 2015 UTC,The russian MBT's apparently trade firepower for manageable armor. Same story applies all the way from the 62 to the T90. Russian ERA is made to defend against APFSDS though because of their design. If you covered a T80 in Kontakt it could possibly add on another 100-200mm vs AP and pretty much impen vs HEAT.
ArmoredWarfare,3dp8w4,TheAylius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:38:02 2015 UTC,"The russian MBT's apparently trade firepower for manageable armor.   Problem is that that weaker armor makes the firepower advantage worthless since all enemy vehicles can use HEAT on you and roll as much or higher than your APFSDS. And you can't use HEAT on them due to their use of composite armor and lack of weakspots anywhere. Even with just AP ammo, something like a Leo 2 can roll on average 50 damage lower than the T-80, with a faster RoF and about the same accuracy.   Working rubber skirts / ERA for the LFP would help the T-80 use its supposed ""advantage in firepower"" over enemy MBTs. It doesn't have to be upgraded to the T-80U standard, but at least the T-80BV standard."
ArmoredWarfare,3dp8w4,TheAylius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:57:13 2015 UTC,"The T90 should at least now get Integral ERA in the LFP. It is currently the only tier 8 MBT that a challenger 1 with its shit AP can penn frontally. This isn't a tier 8 MBT. It's like reciprocate said, a side graded tier 7. The penetration buff is great and all but they aren't looking at this like they are with the other tanks. The Leopard2A5 is supposed to be ARMOR based so, with its excellent armor it is frontally impenetrable to every single tank in this game. The T90 forgoes armor for firepower, but it's firepower cannot overpower all the tier 8's armor, and even some tier 7's armor. All the while it can get blitzed by any myriad of lower tier tanks all the way down to tier 5.   ERA is only useful when people shoot it, and no one does. Every time someone fights the T90 they scan it for a moment, shoot the LFP and back away. The 125mm has 46 more average damage and 72 more penetration compared to the L55 on the Leopard. This is NOT enough to warrant the lack of armor. Should the T90 get 1,000,000mm of penn then? No. It should get more reliable armor so it's comparable to the Other Tier 8's. Lower front plate integral ERA is the least that can be done, and I hope another Buff is given because this is the most fragile tier 8 by a mile."
ArmoredWarfare,3dp8w4,TheAylius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:14:53 2015 UTC,If only you shared the same zeal to get the T-80 buffed. Why should the T-80 share the same fate as the T-90? Damned BMD-1s can pen it frontally. The 125 on the T-80 is in no better state than the T-90's anyway.
ArmoredWarfare,3dp8w4,Hombremaniac,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:51:51 2015 UTC,"I do, I was advocating for the rebalancing of the 125mm's and the armor schemes for the longest times."

ArmoredWarfare,3dp8w4,Hombremaniac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:20:26 2015 UTC,The T90 has Kontakt-5 all over the front plate and on the turret. The T80U is completely bathed in it. This would actually constitute as a legit tier 8 imo. It would even have ERA on the LFP. The thing would be insane. It should have a LFP problem but it's gun needs to be way stronger.
ArmoredWarfare,3dp8w4,TheAylius,2,Sat Jul 18 08:25:05 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, T-90 was the weakest of T8 tanks. But they've said they are buffing LFP and turret ring, so maybe it will be ok.  And yes, ERA armor is sexy and I want it on my russian tonks."
ArmoredWarfare,3dp8w4,Hombremaniac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:01:20 2015 UTC,"I made a thread on the T90 on the official forums requesting the buff.

People keep saying ""it's impossible to place, Russians don't put ERA there"". Well the RAMKA and Terminator sure do. The DPM for me as well just didn't increase. Who knows maybe I need the top gun to see a DPM increase."

ArmoredWarfare,3dp8w4,Hombremaniac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:57:43 2015 UTC,I was also unpleasantly surprised that T-80 does not have any extra armor for research. I mean that beast is often completely clad in era armor and ingame it seems as having worse turret than T-72.

There isn't a single spot on the tank any tier 6 can penetrate for full damage reliably (maybe the back)  MBT70 looks great. It has its weakspots but is quite strong frontally.
ArmoredWarfare,3dn4ef,Colindapieman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"I love the Exp. It just looks so amazing.  Shoot the front viewport for pean and full damage  Yeah its great. Just not my type, if you know what I mean"
ArmoredWarfare,3dn4ef,PanzerFaust360,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:04:46 2015 UTC,Exp is pretty much a stingray that's a bit bigger. You shouldn't have to hit the viewport with the terminator. The entire side should be overmatch.
ArmoredWarfare,3dn4ef,Colindapieman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:15:31 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the gun depression. It is fast, extremely mobile and has amazing gun handling and depression. The gun is amazing as well. Only real problem is armor (you really shouldn't be taking many hits) and the lack of gun elevation, which can be really inconvenient. Most tanks have the advantage at the bottom of the hill, with the Exp tank its the opposite."

ArmoredWarfare,3dn4ef,MajesticDreamWeaver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:42:34 2015 UTC,"MBT is what I believe all premiums should be like. Fast and well armored. Very well balanced.  Expeditionary tank is my favorite. It's fast and has a great gun. Plays out more like a TD, and that's okay.  And then the Terminator. The big topic. Now the armor makes sense. It's built on a MBT hull but is missing the autoloader and big turret and gun. Allows for extra armor. Read the Wikipedia article in it. Better armored than many MBTs. I feel the armor is fine, there are weak-spots. I think it has too much firepower. Now, it is basically a A-10 on treads, but the HE is ridiculous. I could damage anything with it. I think the auto-loader needs to be nerfed in some way."

Terminator is a scout with T-90's armor with bugged turret, when you don't do ""no pen"", ""no effect"", ""module hit""  or just nothing (your shot hit turret but nothing append) you can do damage in turret ... just half damages, nice  Expediationnary, TD smaller than vbl with 90% chance do half damage and 4 secs reload time, nice (less op than others, but really this 50% damage mecanics ...

ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,TarkLark,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:47:24 2015 UTC,yeah it sucks but if they would just lossen up the spotting mechanics with hills and such. Many a time I've gotten shot by something that was completely visible and I was covered up by a hill supposedly. I move back and stop getting shot then he gets spotted. Seems like the server was doing its ray tracing from the back of my tank rather than the top.

ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,TheScarlettHarlot,6,Thu Jul 16 07:14:49 2015 UTC,"How would you suggest they do it? I don't think its the best system but without vastly redesigned maps, spotting systems like War Thunder's always on spotting wouldn't work.  Spotting is also computationally expensive for the server as you have to do at minimum 4(and maybe more) ray traces from every tank to EVERY other tank to see if you can see any part of that tank. And this has to be done at minimum every second (hopefully faster).  Please be constructive rather than just tossing useless whining out."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,QuietTank,6,Wed Jul 15 16:07:05 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a real-vision system. If you can see it, you can see it. Make the spotting range be the range where you can highlight the target, your crew calls out targets, and gather target info (HP, type, etc.)  Honestly, if even be okay with maybe light tanks and AFVs using the current system so they can be sneakier.  This way, camo (once we get it) would actually matter a bit."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,TarkLark,2,Thu Jul 16 01:58:15 2015 UTC,I've actually thought about that system as well. It seems like good mix of WoT and WT systems that allows scouts to scout without totally crippling other tanks.
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,BitchpuddingBLAM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:46:24 2015 UTC,"Definitely sounds appetizing, although I don't think the maps currently are big enough to support it because you could see the enemy coming before they had a chance to get into cover if any in that area... Think Southwest on Cold Strike."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,TarkLark,2,Thu Jul 16 15:27:30 2015 UTC,How does it work in Warthunder?
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,WankingWarrior,5,Wed Jul 15 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"War Thunder is essentially if any teammate of yours has line of sight to the enemy their tank model is rendered. You might not get an indicator(only in arcade anyway) for it but you can still see them its up to you to notice they are there and to shoot them.  Sometimes this breaks down with the oddest cover like dirt piles and street corners, where they are probably only 100-200 meters away and you just shot them but when taking cover around a corner they disappear even if you move your 3rd person camera around the corner you don't see their tank's model because you were the only one spotting them and now you're not so they dissapear. But as soon as you round the corner again they will be there, so its not nearly as bad as the spotting problems of WoT and AW but its still a little wonky."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,Razgriz01,2,Wed Jul 15 20:56:09 2015 UTC,"Well, there is times in WT where it gets really bad... Worse then WOT. 10-20m in front of a tank? Bah.

ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,TarkLark,4,Thu Jul 16 07:09:45 2015 UTC,"Guaranteed visibility after a shot is fired with a long delay before you can disappear again. The explosions/shockwaves from tank guns are huge, loud, and hot. You may be hard to spot until you shoot, but definitely not after."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,Modo44,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"And how do you see what to shoot at in the first place?  It would be a neat mechanic to have like realistic battles in war thunder, enemies model is always visible but not HUD markers so visual scanning is key.... but this game isn't for realism, just like WoT it is an Arcade game essientially so that won't work. And then you get the whole well turn down your graphics and its easier to see the enemy so now its not fair.  I'm not saying it will ever be fair but I think the current system while not the most agreeable is the best fit for an arcade style game."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,OtterTenet,2,Wed Jul 15 19:00:25 2015 UTC,"It would be an addition to normal spotting mechanics, not a replacement. A simple method of preventing infinite shots from nowhere within the old system."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,Beav3r,2,Wed Jul 15 19:18:35 2015 UTC,"Main reason the system you describe cannot work is Cheating.  If you send the client information, anyone can make a program that shows that information to the player. This means that HUD markers can be re-drawn, giving that player an advantage.  You don't want that system, it ends up being less realistic than WoT."

ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,Regyn,3,Wed Jul 15 18:31:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. With maps as big as they are on AW, there is no reason for vehicles to be ""invisible"". It's not like WoT where team spawns are within a stone's throw of each other and perma-visible vehicles would lead to a slaughter.  I know they are trying to encourage people to use recon vehicles as scouts etc, but come on - that level of intelligent team play simply doesn't exist within the demographic this kind of game appeals to, outside of platoons and clans. It never has. At least not in the numbers necessary to support the mechanic properly.  I've all but given up on WoT ever pulling me back in, and I was hoping Obsidian would learn from the mistakes of WG and fix many of the problems WG simply won't acknowledge, or cannot remedy due to the godawful Big World engine's limitations.  But nope. Cut n pasted game mechanics with a reskin. I know it's (relatively) early days, but unless there are a lot of fundamental changes on the way...it's basically WoT 2.0, and I'm out."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,_Madison_,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"I know it's (relatively) early days   I would like to think that way but this spotting system has been pretty much the same since early alpha way back in January.  Sure they have made a few changes to spotting distances and small adjustments to camo ratings, But they have made no changes to the core mechanic of the system and that is the disappointing thing that they don't seem to be caring that invisible tanks firing guns should not be happening."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,ItumTR,2,Wed Jul 15 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"Too bad it is not a carbon copy verion of WoT, then it would be atleast consitant. Here in AW it is a like guessing if you are maybe spotted, or not."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,Ketadine,3,Wed Jul 15 17:22:00 2015 UTC,"I think overall AW is a vast step forward of WoT.  I wish arty was removed from the game, but the AW arty is a far better than in WoT.

ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,Ketadine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:33:53 2015 UTC,What makes it frustrating is that it will hit you in places where you would be totally in cover from other damage sources. Also it is plain boring to play with or against it.

ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,ejd37,0,Fri Jul 17 19:01:23 2015 UTC,"As seems to be the case in this thread no-one made any attempt to read or understand the specific problem, I never said i have a problem with all of the spotting system as i said in the very first paragraph ""tanks sitting 250m directly in front of you to be firing their gun and still not ever be visible.""  It's not about the spotting but the invisible tanks sitting within medium/visual range firing their guns and still staying invisible.  Always visible tanks like WT is not a good system and i would never want that, What i want removed is tanks firing at those ranges and not having consequences for doing so.  This to me was the major flaw of WoTs spotting system and they have/had the opportunity to fix it."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,OtterTenet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:16:34 2015 UTC,"I see were you're coming from. But removing ""stealth"" would mean that you need to rebalance alot of vehicles. An mbt won't stay hidden at that range, but most lighter vehicles have better stealth to make up for the missing armor. Otherwise only mbt/heavy tanks get played."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,Beav3r,0,Fri Jul 17 20:48:58 2015 UTC,"It's not stealth when a tank can fire massively loud, heat producing guns with massive shockwaves and still be invisible at 250m, It's just absurd."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,OtterTenet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:56 2015 UTC,"I think the current system would probably work much better if they simply made it so that either   If an enemy you can't see fires and hits you, they immediately become visible to you (with the exception of arty)  Their muzzle flash and muzzle smoke is always visible in line of sight even if their tank isn't.   I think either one of these, or both, would make the current spotting system a lot less frustrating."
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,HandBanaba,2,Sat Jul 18 03:15:37 2015 UTC,"Too many people seem to be happy with the mediocrity of the system because of their familiarity with it from WoT.  I just don't get why people straight out accept and settle for a system just because it's the same as what you know when the possibility is there to have something different and potentially better.  I'm not suggesting that a whole spotting system overhaul is needed as some people seem to think, But that a change is needed to combat medium range invisible tanks firing and not being spotted, As someone else mentioned tank guns create massive sound, heat, shockwaves and dust kickbacks it seems rather stupid that a tank can be firing these guns and still be invisible at medium ranges (200-400m)"
ArmoredWarfare,3de4l4,Razgriz01,2,Wed Jul 15 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"Nothing is so extra frustrating as when you are driving, are suddenly spotted and killed within span of few seconds without even seeing single one of those attackers.  I guess I will have to pay money to somebody in order to play with in scout vehicle so that I can have good game in my MBT.  edit: Just to make it clear, I like AW a ton better than WoT. I was unable to get past tier 3 in WoT, I hated most of the time spent playing it (also graphics were rather poor) so after few hours I uninstalled WoT never to return."

Interestingly enough, you could pop smoke once on the LAV-150 90. Will I buy it at release?

ArmoredWarfare,3dcyhs,Highw4ySt4r,3,Wed Jul 15 15:56:43 2015 UTC,"The LAV-150 90 was a blast to play! My first game: http://imgur.com/a/RaEcU  As /u/LRafols said, it plays a lot like the LAV-300. To me it feels like a really stiff version of the LAV-300. Like it moves the same only everything is slower like turret traverse, top speed, turning speed, etc. But it's still close enough that I freakin love it!  The LAV and wheeled vehicles in general REALLY suit my play style more than anything I've ever played and I'm much better in a typical game in a wheeled vehicle than I ever was in a tank. If the playstyle stays the same and they aren't nerfed into the ground to where they can't pen anything or completely lose thier moving camo bonus I'd probably never really play anything else.   Tha Abbot is stupid fun, I only got to play one game in it Yesterday due to not getting off work until 12:30A EST but that one game was a ton of fun! I didn't realize it had a three shot magazine until I fired all three rounds and thought the reload time was bugged. I got wrecked pretty fast as I didn't know the new map or realize that our spawn and the enemy spawn were so close together, Still managed close to 2000 damage in 3 magazines and firing and moving between ever shot to try and stay ahead of the enemy advance. It's pretty awesome for sure! I can't wait for my day off this week so I can give all the new prems a shake down!"
ArmoredWarfare,3dcyhs,HandBanaba,3,Wed Jul 15 12:44:21 2015 UTC,The encounter game mode on the   Pipelines map is kinda majorly screwing over the arties. But the other vehicles are also suffering from the spawn location. I really hope they move one of the spawns to the over side of the map and the cap circle in a more viewable position.

I really like the direction they're taking arty so far and seeing that in action was cool.  The LAV seemed pretty good too; the gun is decently powerful and I was able to rack up a lot of kills in it. I did find the wheels a bit hard to control at times; it's more difficult to make fine adjustments and maneuvers at close quarters. I appreciated how much gun depression it has too. Seems like a generally solid vehicle."

ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,TheAylius,3,Tue Jul 14 23:19:38 2015 UTC,Retrofitting is what MBTs need. Added armor and ERA would fix most of the problems MBTs are facing at lower tiers.

ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,bspooky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:12:14 2015 UTC,I wish there was a game or program that allowed you to make your own tank. I know Superpower 2 has that but it isnt really in depth.
ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,pepolpla,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:19:44 2015 UTC,Can it be a robotic attack vehicle instead of a tank? Robocraft looks to be WoT and AW like in terms random battles between two teams. Instead of just tiers you actually build your robot tank/vehicle using voxels. So if Minecraft and WoT/AW had a baby...  Obviously not for you if you want actual real tank models though.
ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,bspooky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:01:10 2015 UTC,"So basically you could buff your tank for the same tier or once retrofited it will move up the tiers ? I did not see any mention of this and if indeed you're staying on the same tier, it might make the match more imbalanced."
ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,Ketadine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:15:30 2015 UTC,"You are buffing your vehicles but it apparently is not enough to cause them to move up the tiers.

ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,bspooky,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:49:37 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I'm ok with this entirely as it will only add to the grind and the disparity between the same tiered vehicles.
ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,Ketadine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:13:36 2015 UTC,"A few odd things. Wasn't the T-55(obj. 155) supposed to be the tier 2 MBT in that tree? They just made a post about it a few days ago saying the T-55 would be in the tree. Armored Talk / AW site post I can't imagine it being above tier 2 and the T-54 is obviously inferior so it would pretty much have to be tier 1 I'd think?  The Utility shells look awesome for Arty! finally something other than just lobbing shells and running. I wonder if these shells will also cause the map to be pinged and your location given away since they aren't going to be doing damage? I really wanna see AoE type shells that do much smaller damage over a larger area. Like the shells that airburst and then rain down shrapnel in an area. Would be useful for when you get a pile of tanks behind cover, you won't do much damage, like 20-30 to them but it puts pressure on them to move, etc.   Hopefully we won't have too many people whinging about the retrofit system before we at least get a chance to really test it out. Or how vision shells will somehow negate their entire self-worth and make the game broken crap. But you know someone is gonna do it. :-/  All in all EA4 looks like it's going to be amazing! I can't wait."
ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,HandBanaba,2,Wed Jul 15 03:51:02 2015 UTC,They probably changed their mind and obj. 155 is going to be either premium T2 or T3 or maybe the tree will fork on some of these tiers.
ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,Trayanee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:29:25 2015 UTC,"While you are probably right about it branching which means they plan on having (at least) two separate MBT lines. So we'll probably lose the ability to grind one tank and unlock two different tanks I'm betting, like the T64 grinding both the T-72 and Chieftain. Instead we'll have the obj. 155 grinding towards one and the T-54 towards the other.  I'd like to see similar things done with the other lines as well, like the TD line, we will probably be getting at least a tier 2 TD in the near future with a reduced ""Damage from greater than 300M"" requirement which would make a lot of people happy. Like each TD in the line would still have a minimum damage and XP requirement but you're actively working towards the damage with all tanks and the XP from the previous TDs.   I just really like the idea of other lines having interesting requirements to unlock as long as they are in-line with the role of the vehicle and not fucktardedly RNG based. (Like cap as a heavy tank or set fire to 3 tanks in one battle sort of shit) I'd like to see some vehicles only be unlockable from PVP or PVE or have some kind of mission system to unlock them that also rewards equipment and stuff for it as you progress the mission.   I can't imagine anyone paying for a prem tier 2 MBT really. Balancing it considering it's better in almost every way than the T-54 IRL would also be troublesome.   Sorry, I just really love the game and i'm super excited to see what new features they give us to make the play more dynamic! I can't wait until our Base is ready for us to work with! /giddy"

ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,Trayanee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:41:30 2015 UTC,"You're right. I personally don't care for any of the vehicles that are shared with WoT as they are right now. I've played the M60, the M48, the T-62A, the Leo 1, and the Obj. 430 in Wot form, some for 3+ years so I just don't find them interesting any more you know?  Playing any of the tanks that both games have in common is a completely unique experience of course and they are only similar in form at best but thats enough for me to not care for them very much. But you're definitely right, Other people are still huge fans of them and should totally be able to play and purchase them in this new form.   Thought process redundancy check: Confirmed."
ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,HandBanaba,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:09:35 2015 UTC,I am just not sure how I feel about vehicles in AW overall at the moment. In my very core I am a collector as in the more the better so If there was a game with tanks since Mark I till Armata I would be super happy which is kind of connected to the fact I like variability which is of course disappearing with time as the best solutions have already been found and are just being upgraded and there is unification and standardisation in place too. Thats the reason I like designs from 50s and 60s. Diversity still exists there...
ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,Trayanee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:19:54 2015 UTC,More likely the T-54 will be the premium. If not a tier 1 tank.

ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,Trayanee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:39:30 2015 UTC,"Surely a mistake? it would make absolutely no sense for the T-55 to be premium. Obsidian only mentioned the tank once and they said ""T-54/T-55"" referring to the T-62 replacing the older chassis."

ArmoredWarfare,3db7hk,Ketadine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:31:02 2015 UTC,"True, they would be very difficult to balance and would still infuriate a lot of people since they are taking damage behind cover which was one of the major complaints about Arty like the FV304 and other brit arty is thier stupid high ark negated a lot of commonly known arty cover.   I just really want Arty to be as dynamic and fun to play as possible without wrecking other peoples enjoyment of the game. Also, any bit it can differ from WoT and still be fun is a bonus in my book."

Each team should either have 1 SPG or no SPG, putting a team with an SPG against one without will be a big disadvantage. Also discouraging is a lack of AFV's.  I can't tell you how many matches I see teams lose because the 1 or 2 AFV's on their side get picked off early or are off dicking around leaving the MBT's blind. If we had a 1/3 minimum of AFV's or TD's it would improve the quality of matches IMO.  Scorpion as a T3...worse than cancer. As a T2 it was a lot of fun, as a T3 I can already tell you it will feel under-powered and massively outclassed without the addition of HEAT or APDS rounds."

I must say I may not have quite as many kills as with say a T72 or A3 in my LAV-300 but I sure as hell have more fun playing a TD.   The grind to get the LAV-300 was absolute god damn cancer. I tried grinding the A3 which is far from a sniper, grinding the Leo-1 is a bear because it has paper armor, I ended up actually grinding the BMP-1 to BMP-2 and using its impressive missile and cannon to get the 300+ meter damage I needed to unlock it.  Allowing more types of tanks earlier on will help players figure out what they like playing the most so they can grind where they have the most fun and do the most damage."

I'm betting we will see a tier 1 MBT and then there will be like the M113/PT-76 as tier 1 AFVs and they will like branch out to TD's, SPGs, etc, or even we'll see new tier 1 LT's since the M41 is already a tier 2 LT.   There are tons of tanks to fill the Tier 1/2 roles. Hell, have the T-54 be the tier 1 MBT, PT-76 be the tier 1 AFV, Chaffee variant like the T37 be the Tier 1 LT, M107 SPA or the 155MLE F3 for tier 1 arty, the Panhard AML 60 / 90 for the tier 1 TDs..  They could use the Panzer 61 (Pz 61) for the Wolfi tree Tier 1 MBT. I'd love to see it get a digital recreation for sure!

ArmoredWarfare,3d4suc,MiG_Interceptor,12,Mon Jul 13 15:02:48 2015 UTC,"The thing that makes MBTs being used as snipers isn't their accuracy on the move, it is their spotting range. No one wants to move forward and get pooped on by invisible Anti-Tank guns and ATGMs. So MBTS either move into close quaters (city) or sit on the edge of the map, afraid of moving, trying to snipe something.  Other classes have twice as much effective spotting due to their camouflage bonuses AND extra spotting. So those two stats combined (camo+spotting)  give standing still ATs and APCs almost twice as much effective spotting vs a moving MBT.  So for an MBT there isn't much choice, you are FORCED to move into one and the same direction on every map - cities, canyons and such (close quaters), where spotting doesn't matter. MBTS are forced to fight mostly MBTs.  Right now it is very easy to play light tanks and AT vehicles, you basically RAPE MBTs in the open, and they can't respond. This is just absurd. Judging by youtube reviews, this is the general consensus. Light vehicles are OP because they can rape you while being invisible."
ArmoredWarfare,3d4suc,Beav3r,8,Mon Jul 13 16:02:19 2015 UTC,"This is compounded by how poorly MBTs drive, at least at middle tiers.  Have to turn slightly?  Back down to 10kph!"

ArmoredWarfare,3d4nf4,WankingWarrior,3,Mon Jul 13 17:30:40 2015 UTC,The T-64 should have much better armor and for that matter a faster reload time compared to the T-62. The armor should be on par but better against HEAT than the 72's.

ArmoredWarfare,3d4nf4,illusionalsagacity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:55:13 2015 UTC,"It's just the armor. If the LFP isn't fixed it's not going to be the end of the world. But this tank will not exist in any competitive modes and it's just going to make every T90 drivers life harder. No one asked for supreme overkill penetration which is just going to make people screech ""OP GOOD YEEZUS EZ MODE TANK""."
ArmoredWarfare,3d4nf4,TheAylius,0,Mon Jul 13 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"UFP was already impenetrable, as it should be. If the LFP was made harder to pen, ok that's fine. But the T-90 already had the highest AP DPM in the game and got buffed by ~500 when DPM for all vehicles is already too high in addition to a pen buff. Good thing it's not mobile at all. /s"
ArmoredWarfare,3d4nf4,illusionalsagacity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"In stock forum it has the highest but fully upgraded its outed by every other tier 8 MBT. All of those tanks utilize living human loaders, whom you can get perks for to reduce reload. Since the T90 uses an Autoloading system, you get nothing to upgrade, no perks. The DPM tops out kinda like this Leo2A5(5.3K) Ariete(5.2) Abrams(5.1) T90(4.7) And another thing, the lower front plate just needs the RAMKA99's ERA from the lower plate. It's upper armor should remain, no reason to upgrade as of RN. The reason why that DPM is so important, is because you can easily penn a front of a T90 where the Leopard 2A5 and Ariete are way sketchier, and the Abrams is really hit or miss. All those weakspots are RNG where hitting the LFP is just aim. That DPM is really important. Plus the T90 utilizes the ""strongest""'gun of the tier 8 MBT's."

Your commander skill reduces the reload as well, if it's not working report it as a bug.

ArmoredWarfare,3d4nf4,illusionalsagacity,0,Mon Jul 13 22:00:45 2015 UTC,"..the stats I listed were stock with crew upgrades. I don't know anyone right now that has the T90's Top Gun, and it's getting fixed tomorrow so it literally never played a part in the balance of the game. The T90 can have a crew upgrade but the same exact thing can be said for the other MBT's. All you have to do is use that commander."
ArmoredWarfare,3d4nf4,OtterTenet,0,Mon Jul 13 22:04:50 2015 UTC,"You're still getting 5,793 DPM with the commander skill. The Ariete gets 5,690 with the loader and commander.

ArmoredWarfare,3d71qf,Not_F1zzzy90908,-1,Tue Jul 14 02:36:23 2015 UTC,No. Not really. The main purpose of a press account it to be able to show off the game. Therefor they are usually given to players who stream the game a lot or who make videos of the game on youtube. Seeing as many popular youtubers still don't have press accounts really makes me worry about Obsidian's priorities. Press accounts should not be rewards for helping test the game and giving feedback.

People have been asking for night battles since long before Armored Warfare was even a thing, and this has basically been WG's response every time.  EDIT: Noticed the AW-specific comment, which is fourth to last (which was why I didn't point it out at first >.>).  Still don't see it as a particular dig - the game's basically in Alpha/Beta after all.  And, as Joe said... it's a pretty damn ironic thing for someone from Wargaming to say."

Wargaming: ""Graphics don't matter, is all about gameplay!""  Translation: ""2 + 2 = 4, 2+1 = 3, we so smart, you see!""   Proceed to poorly improve graphics instead of gameplay in their own game - with showoff methods like overloading the HD models (leading to a gap between models and scenery).   QUESTION:  Why has Wargaming never fully fixed the admitted problem of Premium Ammo ruining the armor balance and fun of their game?  ANSWER:  Because Premium Ammo being OP is the basis for keeping the community Credit Starved to pump Credit Pack Sales.  Wargaming has stopped selling Gameplay since 2012.   Wargaming Track Record:  PvE Battles? - Promises!  Improved Clan Wars? - Promises!   Historical Battles? - Promises / Cancelled.   Premium Ammo Damage balance? - ""It's a great solution"" -> nothing happens for 2 years. Promises!   Fun premium medium tanks at tier 8? -> cancelled, being good at game earns too many credits! Can't have that!   Good new Maps -> Promises. Over half the newer maps are worse than reworks of old maps. Complete incompetence on show.   New Player Experience? -> Half-ass soul-grating ""tutorial"" with almost no advance mechanics and terrible UI.   UI Improvements for Community? -> Tiny Increments, No actual re-work. 1993 UI in a 2015 game, a joke.  Support improvements for Clan Wars management? -> Promises. Third parties did more in 6 months than Wargaming in 3 years.   Incorporating good UI mods into the game (all the non-stat related improvements of XVM) -> Halfass token efforts that are worse than mods and not customizable from options.  What has Wargaming done with the Money they get from their customers?  DEVELOPED 4+ OTHER GAMES while finding ways to downsize the WoT skeleton crew."

ArmoredWarfare,3d5qwd,HeavyMetalJoe91,3,Tue Jul 14 00:17:06 2015 UTC,The problem with WT do not come from the engine/graphics. Its the ingame economy and treatment of the community by the developer. I still think the gameplay of WT is  better than WoT  but the developer scared me off.

Okay, if you say so...  I like wot, i like wows, i like WT, i like many games (actually too many.. im digging around Pillars of Eternity since months and get nowhere (act 3 now) ^ ).    If someone would ask me why i like AW, i would say that in AW , you not only need to know your movement and all that... but what you use to fire upon what is also much more important.  In WoT i just unload AP unless its a Arty (HE) and if i cant pen it.... i load the 3-4 prem shells i carry with me for such situations.  However in AW i never had that feel, all i had to do is to switch my ammo type (HEP, HEaT, SABOT, etc.)  and HE is not obsolete against anything exept Arty here.  Also: i dont really see AW as a direct compeditor against WG/WOT  (or Gaijin/GF), its something different.  Granted all those games have the same issue as MMORPG's: One can only play ""so"" much per day.  I have roughly 4h of free time each evening, and a lot of things i should, some i must, and some i want to do..."

ArmoredWarfare,3d1w9t,InjuringThunder,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:59:23 2015 UTC,"actually HE and HESH have virtually the same amount pen, at-least in the low tiers. On the scorpion, HE has like 12mm pen and HESH has 10-11.  IF both rounds don't pen HE does more damage but i don't think the damage increase is worth losing the extra module damage that HESH provides.  However if both are able to pen then the extra damage from HE is probably worth it.  I still use HESH though because the damage when you pen is still pretty decent and i absolutely love disabling an MBT's modules as i slowly kill him."

On a flat surface, i would assume that HESH should have a much higher critical rating in regards to internal components, where as HEP should be basically a beefed up bling version of the HE round ?    I just assume HE mechanics arent really finished yet. I dont play that much anymore (still working on Pillars of eternity lol ) but when i can i use HESH over HE  and HEP over HE. But then also i use HEx only against targets i either cant penetrate in my current situation, of on very lightly armored vehicles (IFV) but even then i prefer HEAT."

ArmoredWarfare,3d0kyh,maruzana,8,Sun Jul 12 14:30:24 2015 UTC,"Right, I've seen a few posts pointing out that the 'Grind' is too real in the Early Access Tests. With a number of people suggesting that this should be removed and our progression should be subsidised during the Beta Stages. There are a number of reasons this probably won't happen often, if at all.  Firstly, Obsidian need to test the economy of Armored Warfare. In other words, they need to see how hard or difficult it is to reach Tier 8. If it is too hard or too long, they will change it accordingly. If it is too easy, again it will be re-adjusted before release. They can't launch AW without first testing the economy rigorously.  Secondly, it could be potentially harmful at this point in production to begin messing with code and calculations just to improve our rate of progress through something we don't even get too keep. The basis behind this is the simple idea behind a 'balanced' tech tree. The idea being that the module prices and reputation costs need to be effectively balanced against a particular vehicles capabilities. This would be rather difficult with a fluctuating economy that contained serious statistical anomalies.  Thirdly, this game (sorry, Beta) has enough bugs and holes as it stands, I would prefer that AW get the kinks sorted before they worry about our enjoyment for the time being. Let them get it right first time, I don't want this to go live so that people can complain about this bug, or that glitch simply so I can sit and talk about how fast I got a T-90 during the Early Access Tests.  I also do not see Obsidian providing special premiums to testers yet, as we have already bought into gaining special rewards. That's not to say it won't happen, more that I don't think it likely."
ArmoredWarfare,3d0kyh,InjuringThunder,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:49:05 2015 UTC,What? They already did it for one weekend. Do it for another weekend at least.
ArmoredWarfare,3d0kyh,theycallhimthestug,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:22:49 2015 UTC,I imagine they were planning to do this anyway. Maybe if they made the match number threshold higher than WOWS was(an easy 49 games) then it could really give people a good goal.   One thing i was thinking about the other day on the grinding and economy s that while the total time to a top tier tank in AW and WOT are probably around the same(maybe a bt more for AW) it is compounded by the fact that you only go through 8 tanks in AW there as you would go through 10 in WOT. Makes it feel like it takes longer. The feeling I have been getting(and im only up to tier 4) is that the tanks im driving over stay their welcome. I get tired of playing the same 3 or 4 tanks for 60 battles each especially when i know im only half way to the top and  =hear tha it gets worse.
ArmoredWarfare,3d0kyh,manualLurking,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:40:34 2015 UTC,The reason I don't play much anymore because I dislike my Stingray ever since they nerfed the pen. It doesn't feel the same anymore.  I never did like the T-80. It had awesome alpha but truely shitty armor. I literally couldn't poke out at all and my shells weren't guaranteed pen either.

However accuracy.... i dont know... it feels more like they are laserguided than wireguided, but i thought early ATgm's where wireguided?"
ArmoredWarfare,3d1u72,Ulti2k,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:31:42 2015 UTC,"There wouldn't necessarily be any difference in how wire-guided or beam-riding ATGMs handle, as they both use SACLOS guidance. Also the game doesn't have any of the really early ATGMs, like the Malyutka, which require the operator to manually fly it with a joystick to the target. After those dark ages, ATGMs pretty much just follow line of sight as they do in game, though real ones have some advanced features like automatically leading targets for you and such."
ArmoredWarfare,3d1u72,0pyrophosphate0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:36:12 2015 UTC,"The difference is, Beam riding fly towards where i point my crosshair, thus its impossible to fire BEHIND a building, but with a wire guided you can actually shoot the rocket behind a building at something you CANT see.  (Assuming the beam riding variant has its target beam from the vehicle firing the rocket itself).  I know, nowdays if you had a lock on, you would fire the missile upwards and it would find its target itself, similar to a javelin but the target information comes from a spotting vehicle.

I've reached the high tier tanks and the one have is hopelessly underpowered (and the ones owned by my enemies are ridiculously OP) so I'm not going to unlock anymore for the moment.

ArmoredWarfare,3ctkd7,goodoldxelos,10,Fri Jul 10 17:41:45 2015 UTC,"What Gatortribe also doesn't tell you about getting to t8 is that he platooned with people back when there was a 3 tier max spread. He would always platoon with someone who was 2 tiers lower than his own. He did this to ensure that he was top tier every time and that he always had smaller tanks to easily roflstomp.  I'm not sure why they don't do a fast tracked XP system. It may have something to do with the maybe small amount of people testing. I'm not sure, but the grind is rough sometimes. Especially when you're getting into t8 games with your t5 platoon, or the queue times are in excess of 5 minutes.   Best thing I can say is, we're here for load bearing tests and to submit any kind of suggestions/bug reports that are not found in the closed alpha testing. So I just grin and bear it, and presume it will be better once more people get their hands on it when it goes open beta."
ArmoredWarfare,3ctkd7,MinorityShack,2,Fri Jul 10 20:07:20 2015 UTC,This is irrelevant to the original post. Even if he progressed faster it is still a ridiculous amount of time to spend in a test environment to reach tier 8.
ArmoredWarfare,3ctkd7,Gatortribe,0,Sat Jul 11 18:11:36 2015 UTC,"Because that's totally how MM works, right?   No, it's not my fault. It's not my friends faults. MM is wonky, as you'd expect in an alpha. Even when playing solo, I would get tier 4 matches in my Leopard 2AV.  If you really think I have people who would sacrifice their MM to ""exploit"" MM, I'm flattered. But I don't have that ""power"" and I'm famous by no standards, so I couldn't get people to do it even if I wanted to. We did try it to see if it would work and, surprise, it didn't, instead it just lead to my friends being bottom tier every time. There is the oddball match up where we're the only top tiers and the rest of the team has nothing to match, but there's nothing we can do about it.  Either way, I never did it unless people chose to grind out their low tier tanks but didn't want to leave the toon. And even then, they would get dragged into whatever tier I was playing. If you think I did otherwise, I want proof of it. I don't remember it.  During EA1, I was always in the M60A3 while my friend played his Stingray and another was in the LAV-300. So, no ""abusing"" there. During EA2, I platooned with a Stingray 2 and a Centauro while in the Leopard 2 and M1. Worst offense was playing with Tenet while he was in the LAV-300, which he didn't like because it dragged him into a 7 game and I switched to the LAV-300 instead.   So, if you have proof of me exploiting a bug that I don't know about, I'll apologize to the community. Until then, you're just talking out of your ass."

This is why there is Presumption of Innocence in most civilized courts. This is why you can be charged with Libel - even when the three proof steps are required: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation#Libel  Step 1: Proof of the Original Statement being False:  When you queue a Low Tier + High Tier Platoon. the MM uses the highest tier vehicle as the tier of the Platoon for matchmaking. So a 5+8 platoon will be matched against an 8+8 platoon. This is a clear disadvantage for the 5+8 platoon and is called ""fail platooning"" for that reason.  Step 2: Proof of Harm: Considering a ""Cheater"" reputation undermines every legitimate achievement, the statement caused clear harm to the reputation of the player, who is not a celebrity.  Step 3: Lack of Research: You have failed to display any research or indication that research was performed.  If Libel was against the rules, you and the original poster would be found guilty. What would be the appropriate punishment?   Right now, luckily for you, we have no such rules in the subreddit and no intention to implement them.

Sure, they're getting good data on other things, but the core of it was progression, as it's the first time we've gone to the top tiers, and the first time they've had a chance at measuring the time it would take, and the stock grinds, and so on."
ArmoredWarfare,3ctkd7,Terrachova,2,Fri Jul 10 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"Testing ""progression"" as in, a surrogate for testing the patience of players in general on how much grinding they're are able to get away with without losing their customers.  The end goal is to ask players to grind as much as they can, but not enough to make them quit, all in the name of premium account time."
ArmoredWarfare,3ctkd7,Terrachova,0,Sat Jul 11 01:50:19 2015 UTC,I don't think you are right on this and if you are then early access was a terrible misuse of testing resources. Progression is simply a math problem that could be simulated and estimated. They have equations for XP gain and can plug in numbers derived from player testing.
ArmoredWarfare,3ctkd7,Terrachova,0,Fri Jul 10 19:02:44 2015 UTC,"I am mostly right, in fact.  I shouldn't say that these EA periods were focused solely on progression, however testing the progression was a large part of it, as was high-tier balancing information.  I asked /u/my_freitag about these issues a couple days back, and this was his response regarding high tier balance (I had suggested that unlocking all tiers, or certain tiers at a time, would be a good way to balance better):   Well there's two issues here:   High tier balancing. EA2 is the first time the vast majority of players have gotten their hands on Tier 6-7 vehicles. EA3 will be the same for Tier 8's. Expect to see balancing as a result of this test. Unlocking everything is great ... once we've tuned progression. This extended test was a great data source for progression, and hopefully now we're in a good place to focus a lot more on tuning of vehicles (like premiums)."
ArmoredWarfare,3cvyv3,PanParott,3,Sat Jul 11 05:59:36 2015 UTC,"They have a delay. Just watch two people brawl at full speed at close range, it'll miss. Try using the lockon which locks to the middle of the tank, your shots will always land behind them. It's like .12 seconds or something and incredibly obnoxious. You can even see it when firing at the ground. It's super noticeable after playing wot."
ArmoredWarfare,3cvyv3,atriax,2,Sat Jul 11 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"Well 200 ping is 200 milliseconds, which is .2 of a second if it's not too early for me to do math. I would assume the shot placement (where you aim and where it hits) is serverside, so your client waits for the server to tell you where the shot is going to end up before it plays the animation. Tank movement audio and animation are client-side, which is why in other games if you lag out you can see your tank moving and 'shoot', but get no impact animation nor tracers (WoT for example)."
ArmoredWarfare,3cvyv3,asdaaaaaaaa,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:10:03 2015 UTC,last time i played WoT it had server-sided movement.
ArmoredWarfare,3cvyv3,RA2lover,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:14:39 2015 UTC,"Serverside placement, not serverside movement animations. When you lag out, you can still drive around fine for a bit even though you're not communicating with the server. You can't see your shots nor impact, and you can't 'spend' ammo."

ArmoredWarfare,3csmnj,yosp,3,Fri Jul 10 13:57:30 2015 UTC,"With current balancing, it's the most inferior tier 8 MBT.   It just has no reason to use over any of the other MBT's. It has the worst DPM when fully upgraded, It has an inferior APS. It has the longest grind for a gun I've ever seen, it has a turret ring weakpoint kind of like the abrams and a MAASSIVE lower front plate weakspot. It has the worst soft stats of all the tier 8's to counter it's high alpha and penetration. It's protected less than a RAMKA99. As of right now from the words of Tzar_Ivan it's going to get buffed, and the MS kit they discussed in the article is going to be a retrofit."
ArmoredWarfare,3csmnj,TheAylius,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm interesting. Is the MS kit definitely going to be a retrofit? From what I've heard, retrofits will only be camos and decals."

ArmoredWarfare,3csmnj,TheAylius,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:12:33 2015 UTC,It has better gun stats than Abrams. Havent played T-90 but plain numbers on it are bigger.
ArmoredWarfare,3csmnj,Beav3r,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:42:17 2015 UTC,Define better gun stats? Penetration and alpha? Yes. Prolonged DPM? No.
ArmoredWarfare,3csmnj,TheAylius,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:10:57 2015 UTC,Prolonged dpm doesn't matter. 90% of maps let you peak out of cover - shoot - roll back and wait for reload in safety. In that case higher alpha wins
ArmoredWarfare,3csmnj,Beav3r,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:23:14 2015 UTC,"Prolonged DPM doesn't matter? It certainly does when you have to rush a tank since you have the lowest HP of any tier 8 MBT. It's then got nothing over any of the tier MBT's except for peekaboom alpha. A Leopard 2A5 can out brawl you in a T90. Because of the armor schemes and armor effectiveness you literally cannot control a fight, so you need the DPM when facing any skilled T8 players."
ArmoredWarfare,3csmnj,TheAylius,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:25:03 2015 UTC,"Isn't T-90 Vladimir the T-90A?  That means T-90(which I understand is the oldest batch of T-90) at tier 8 is getting a buff, right?  So T-90AM for tier 9, and Armata tier 10?"

Signed up ages ago and just wasn't lucky, I guess, so sticking with WoT for the time being - is sidescraping a viable tactic in AW? Since I haven't been able to play it I haven't paid much attention to it, this is literally the first gameplay video I've watched.  The reason I ask is I thought that with modern discarding sabots and whatnot, it either pens or it doesn't and angle doesn't make much difference. Clearly this isn't the case with the bounces I saw you take in the video, hence the question."
ArmoredWarfare,3culq1,YouGiveMeTheShits,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:02:40 2015 UTC,"hi, from my experience in game side scraping can and cannot be a viable tactic it all depends on the tank. even on the tanks where it is viable its hard to pull off because of the High penetration sabot rounds you mentioned."
ArmoredWarfare,3culq1,TheScarlettHarlot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not nearly as viable in this game. AW is focused much more on maneuverability. If you want to bounce reliably, be in an MBT and be facing the shot."

ArmoredWarfare,3cqmtc,like1ice,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:39:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there are a couple maps that show promise, and I can never remember the proper name of them:  'Roughneck': This is the Abbey replacement.  It is far from perfect of course - high sniping areas behind the bases, and two corridors along the right and left, with the right 100% closed off from the rest of the map.  Yet, the middle is a rather fun little playground.  No two battles fought in that villa have gone the same way, and barring snipers from the sides, there's ample opportunity for flanking.  'South Coast/Himmelsdorf' - this one had been removed since the last Alpha tests I believe, or EA, but it can be seen in a number of videos on youtube.  Sort of a mix between South Coast and Himmels, though it did feature a prominent high ground, it had many routes for crossing the map, and was a fair bit bigger than either of the referenced maps.  Toning down the height advantage on one side would make this a very solid map I feel."
ArmoredWarfare,3cqmtc,Terrachova,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:15:41 2015 UTC,"The ""Abbey"" map is River Point, and I agree that it's center is highly playable for certain tanks.  It could have been much better if the height differences weren't so huge, and if the defensive bunkers were at the center of the map, not it's edges."

ArmoredWarfare,3cqmtc,Ketadine,7,Fri Jul 10 02:34:39 2015 UTC,"I am thinking long term. Long term, fixing bugs that make upgrades degrade the tank is easier than fixing a map.  Fixing obvious bugs is what will happen anyway.   Fixing Maps might not happen because people aren't paying enough attention.   The impact of maps on gameplay and viability of various tanks, including bugged ones, is severely underrated."

ArmoredWarfare,3cok24,HandBanaba,2,Thu Jul 9 15:00:05 2015 UTC,"Even worse than chain link fence is when it gets stopped by snow fence.   For those that don't know, snow fence is that orange plastic fencing they have in the game and generally found around construction sites in the real world."
ArmoredWarfare,3cok24,theycallhimthestug,5,Thu Jul 9 23:47:35 2015 UTC,Heat should be stopped by everything. The number of surfaces you can shoot through has been steadily improving over the last couple of patches.

ArmoredWarfare,3cok24,beastrabban,6,Thu Jul 9 19:09:45 2015 UTC,Hell yes they do.  We are trained to not fire AT4s at concrete walls because it detonated them.  Even thin mud walls.

ArmoredWarfare,3cl5zi,Brovich,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:20:48 2015 UTC,"Ill copy paste my post from the forums (This goes for the T-90 as well):  It all started with the penetration nerf. Before the penetration nerf, the T-80 was properly balanced. How so you may ask? Well here it is:  T-80 could easily pen the other Tier 7 MBTs. THAT was its main advantage.  After the nerf:  The T-80 cannot reliably pen tier 7 MBTs. Now its gun is Meh. LOW ROF always counter acted the high damage anyways. It has less damage aswell. It takes a longer time to kill enemies, they have a better chance of re-positioning or running away.    Well you may counter that the T-80s armor is now better because of the penetration nerf. Nope, not really. Its LFP weak spot is still weak as shit. Its turret is still weak as well. The armor buff didn't increase its armor in any significant way.  While the M1 Abrams went from good to great because its armor is based on even coverage. The leopard 2 went from good to great because of its even coverage. The Chalengers armor remained really good. The T-80 got the short end of the stick because of the way its armor is laid out."

ArmoredWarfare,3cl5zi,MotherTruckinMexican,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:06:07 2015 UTC,It's a recon vehicle. Because of this the view range is absurdly high (after nerf not so much but still really good for its tier).

ArmoredWarfare,3cl5zi,Ketadine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:04:51 2015 UTC,what's wrong with the BMP-3?
ArmoredWarfare,3cl5zi,eLdritch_MD,5,Wed Jul 8 21:16:54 2015 UTC,"Lots of things.   It can't perform the role of a scout with its terrible view range and isn't small enough or mobile enough to do any kind of ""active scouting"" (a WoT term for scouts that run around and spot stuff, using mobility and small size to avoid enemy fire). Basically if you want to perform as a scout you need either the VBL or Weasel.   The 100mm gun has a terrible RoF for its caliber (9 seconds, while other tanks 120m guns are loading in half that time), has an awful shell velocity and only fires HE. The accuracy and aim time stinks too. I only take one or two shots with it to harass stupid enemies that sit still long enough.   The 30mm autocannon is the same one you got at tier 5, so good luck with that in tier 6.  The missiles travel slowly and never pen despite having close to 700mm of penetration. Then there's the annoying flaw where switching from auto cannon to your missile makes you reload your missile again even though it should still be in the barrel where you left it.  Then there's the HP and ridiculous alpha-damage curve in this game. At tier 5 people are doing about 400-500 damage, the tier 8 tanks are doing about 1000. It's like facing against the old tier ten TDs in WoT. You're a two-shot-kill for anything you face.   My suggestions; buff the HP of all the larger AFVs. Make the 100mm reload faster and give it HEAT rounds or APCR in addition to the HE. Buff the view range so it's at least the same as the BMP-2 (you're a taller and more modern machine but can't see as far WTF)."
ArmoredWarfare,3cl5zi,Gatortribe,2,Wed Jul 8 21:28:59 2015 UTC,"A lot of the high tier AFVs aren't good scouts, performing better as fire support tanks following MBTs and TDs around and flanking what engages them.  That being said, I'd be fine with buffing the 100mm on the BMP-3 with a better rof. Though I'm not sure it has a HEAT round. I know it doesn't have an armor piercing round, it's designed to be low recoil to fit the breech into the BMP turret. It simply can't handle the pressure from firing an AP round irl."
ArmoredWarfare,3cl5zi,WankingWarrior,0,Wed Jul 8 23:49:32 2015 UTC,"It does not have HEAT.  It does, however, have airburst HE; not sure how that's going to affect tanks though.  100mm gun with 30mm gun fixed to it is supposed to significantly increase 30mm autocannon accuracy, though; maybe that number should be played with a bit.  BMP-3 can also fire and guide ATGM on the move thanks to stabilized turret(meanwhile BMP-2M can fire two Kornet each with 1000mm+ pen after ERA...).  So it should be a AFV/LT hybrid, so it has no bloom when moving in straight line.  Also, is it me not reading the proper parts of menu or does BMP-3M not have ERA blocks in-game?"
ArmoredWarfare,3cl5zi,Gatortribe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:36:02 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah its a FSV, definitely not a scout. On this issue not gonna talk about it more since it's kinda all that needs to be said.  The 100mm could use a buff in its reload, but that's about it. It's honestly not bad. The 30mm had good pen, but with these nerfs to ac pen, makes life rough. The missiles are pretty solid, but you gotta avoid spaced armor and era. It will fuck up your missiles.  Regarding the hp/alpha thing , that's already being looked at by the devs, but yeah unfortunately ya gotta accept you're a 2 shot for everything the higher you go up due to the ridiculous alpha other tanks get.  I've played til the BMP-3M. While AFVs are certainly not the best, they most definitely arent totally fucked. Just gotta play really careful cause everything will fuck you up. Definitely could use buffs though."
ArmoredWarfare,3cl5zi,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:38:43 2015 UTC,"Damn man that BMP-3 review you wrote sounds terrible.

ArmoredWarfare,3cl5zi,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:03:13 2015 UTC,"For me its the arties, but it's probably because they aren't implemented fully yet. With the recent bug that doesn't show explosions + map cover + HE RNG both in damage and in accuracy + shell travel time => a match where you need more luck then skill to actually hit things, let alone get kills and this should not be the case."

I found the patton to be pretty annoying to penetrate with the T62 pre pen Nerf so I can only fathom how it is now. That being said there's a lot to argue about low tiers and I don't wanna start a forum about the first MBT's.   The Swingfire is an M113 with two top launching ATGM's on the back roof. It has zero cannons or machine guns, only ATGM's.. This being said the tank has an excellent view range and some of the most obscene camo you'll see in a while. Sit back, spot, pester people with the ATGM's. Avoid tanks with ERA and remember, you're an AFV so work on spotting and avoid being spotted.   The Chieftan right now is in sort of a bad place. If I remember correctly it doesn't get APFSDS rounds, which it got as a later modification. It has good armor when facing lower Tiers and when you can position well, but when an opponent can target your weak points your armor means really nothing. The Chieftan is in the works to be rebalanced right now. As for aesthetics the ""Retrofit"" system is still in the works, and I believe you can apply newer gen equipment on older gen tanks. If not you could probably wait until later release when they also release different versions of the Chieftan."

The swingfire is a scout/recon tank (despite tomatoes in game calling it a sniper). It finds a scouting location, camps, and spots. Whilst spotting is a missile launcher with high damage but long reload time. It can't fire unless stationary and is very weak."

Of course, the Leo 1 can be penned anywhere by foul language doesn't have its historically incredible mobility to make up for it at the moment, so yeah its a bit of a mismatch."

ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,w0nk0,6,Tue Jul 7 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"More close games and fewer steam-rolls can only be a good thing IMO.  As for your downside, if the MM has done its job then you should have a 50% chance of winning.  That means you will only have as many tomatoes on your team as you have shown yourself capable of carrying, the rest will be yellows and greens etc.  I suspect the spread of skill levels will end up looking similar to the spread of vehicle tiers between the teams: one team will have a unicum and an extra yellow, the other will have two more blues etc.  In order for you to get a team with one purple and 14 reds, that purple would have to stupendously good and able to almost single-handedly defeat 15 greens.  I've seen no evidence so far in WoT that anyone can be that good.  Personally, the solution I would most like to see is for the MM to pick 30 people of similar skill level as well as similar tank tier.  That way, purples hardly ever play with reds and yellows.  Of course, this would need a large active player base to work though.  It would also mean the AFK bots get to play on teams entirely made up of other AFK bots :)"

ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,x7x_,3,Wed Jul 8 05:40:37 2015 UTC,The problem is that a super purple and a red vs 2 blues would end with the blues victorious. While the super purple is punished every single game for being the best. Many games have skill based mm but it is generally reserved for competitive play with smaller more organized teams.  If we applied this to WoT mm would count me the same as 4 average players and give me 3 bot teammates. That hardly seems fun.

I for example can hold my own with the T-62 or T-64 on equal tiers => green, but if I'm in a tier or two higher it becomes a problem => yellow tomato. How will they address this ?"
ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,Ketadine,3,Wed Jul 8 07:19:35 2015 UTC,"I think there is a misconception on how our MM works, its not ""skill based"" it simply separates skilled players from each other AFTER they are chosen for the match. Each match can have varied skill levels."

I'm a little confused about why you say it's not skill based? The team composition is skill-based as i understand - after all the players for the match have been gathered, the teams are made up to balance the skill of both teams out, no?  I would say it's skill-based, even though skill is only the secondary variable after vehicle. Maybe there's a better expression for it though, or maybe I didn't fully understand the process?"
ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,Jinxx71,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:48:22 2015 UTC,"When I hear skill based I think good players only play vs good players, and bad player v bad. This just isn't the case in our game. The MM finds 30 suitable players based on vehicles that are in the queue, THEN looks at skill and attempts to swap a few players if needed between teams to try to balance out the skill level. I would also note its only one factor and will never result in 14-15 games all the time."

ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,OfensiveBias,7,Tue Jul 7 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"Having equal skilled teams does not prevent steamrolls. This is the largest fallacy of this whole debate. In fact, /u/MicMan24 did a study of 300 random matches he played in WoT and made an excellent write up here.  In the end, 50% matches had the most steamrolls.  Steamrolls happen when one side gets a small advantage that rapidly compounds. For instance, the left flank wins, circles around the middle flank and then middle and left destroy the right flank."
ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,Vuvuzevka,2,Tue Jul 7 22:28:01 2015 UTC,"Indeed, streamroll happens because of the very nature of the game : stats-based RPGish game with huge tiers difference, and no respawn. So everything is decided in the first 30s on the game.  In a skill-based game with fast respawns, a small mistake or a bad start can be fought and won over, not in WoT (and as far as I know, not in AW). Snowballing is, sadly, the standard in multiplayer game since some years.  I guess that a skill based MM can't hurt though."

ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,OfensiveBias,0,Tue Jul 7 22:55:54 2015 UTC,"I agree that the idea of preventing steamrolls is distracting from the issue at hand. The MM should aim to set up fair games that tend to last longer, irrespective of the end score. If the match then progresses to a steamroll, it is fine. The MM put together 2 teams of equal skill and the nature of the game and mistakes caused it to progress that way. It is not the MM's fault.  As for the study quoted, a MM is only as good as it's cost function. In his analysis the OP used the XVM winrate. Had he used some other measure of player skill he might have found that the matches were completely random and unfair. Here is a 1000 battle study on XVM's win rate prediction which the OP used: http://ftr.wot-news.com/2015/01/22/just-how-accurate-the-xvm-win-chance-is/ with the conclusion: ""XVM is inaccurate. You win for example 27% of 40%ers, 50% of 50%ers and 73% of 60%ers.""

If you apply this theory to his study, that means that matches with win chances higher and lower than 50% are even more imbalanced than XVM% would suggest. and yet, these massively unbalanced matches fail to produce as many steamrolls 50% matches?   The MM should aim to set up fair games that tend to last longer, irrespective of the end score.   Do you have any evidence that ""fair"" matches tend to last longer?

Do you have any evidence that ""fair"" matches tend to last longer? I have not seen any evidence either way, and until someone comes up with numbers, that is just speculation.   No I do not, and I do not assert otherwise. That is just my opinion of what a good MM should try to achieve. Based on player skill and vehicles the matchup should be fair. I believe the longer duration will follow but I do not have any hard evidence for this neither did I try to assert that.   What do you define as a good game? matches were the chance to win is 50%, or matches where every other player is statistically average and your personal contribution really matters in the match?   I do not believe a good and importantly fun game is set up by trying to predict the end result. The matchmaker should only be concerned about the start composition. So, a good start setup would strike a balance between player vehicle tiers and classes in the teams as well as ensuring a similar skill bracket in both teams."
ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,Konsalik,3,Wed Jul 8 18:03:12 2015 UTC,"If you want close matches then there needs to be a ""clam wars"" type matchmaking done separately. This game has a lot more going for it than a MOBA where it's less than 10 players total. When teams get above 6 players things get, hectic. Many professional leagues recognize this and stick to ""sixies"" for championship team play.   If Armored Warfare was to introduce such I'd be all for it. Keeping the tryhards in the deepend where they can tryhard their hearts out and out of the PUG area with their ""i'm the 1%, worship me!"" attitudes."
ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,swiftSlowPoke,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:10:12 2015 UTC,"On the minus side, this means that, to achieve an average team on your side, if you are a very good player, you are getting below-average team mates. This applies the more the better you are. If you were a Unicum in WOT and achieved 60-ish win percentages, you will basically be guaranteed all-tomato teams all day.   This only really happens if you use win % as a metric of skill and the cost function of the matchmaker is to get as close to a 50% average as possible. Building a matchmaker like that is really shitty and will punish better players like you pointed out. However, this is why matchmakers rarely consider win % as a metric in decision making rather using some cost function indicative of player skill (WN8, ELO, etc) to group together players of similar skill. The similar skill goal is better and more varied than setting the goal of equal chance of winning.   The downside of skill based matchmaking is that you require a sizable population to make it successful. If this is not the case then the matchmaker will put together games where the skill variance is once again too high.  In the end I support ELO based systems such as those used in CS;GO and Dota 2. They do have their flaws but most of the time they put together games that are challenging and most importantly, fun."
ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,TankFodder7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:13:50 2015 UTC,"I think you have a very valid point. Interestingly, on my most-played WOT account (US), I had good, but not unicum WN8, but excellent Win% since I always played the objective and didn't mind sacrificing myself if it made a win much more likely. I guess I would be on the winning side of such a ""performance-based"" MM as opposed to ""win-equal"", since I would have stats that are worse than my ability to swing games, and thus be able to win over 50% consistently.  I'm not sure if your point makes me a lot more happy about it - I think it's definitely better than pure win% ""optimization"" though. It  would at least allow me to measure my performance through win rate, which is what I care most about.  All that said, interestingly enough I enjoy losses in AW a lot more than in WOT, which I mostly attribute to non-bottleneck maps."

ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,swiftSlowPoke,2,Wed Jul 8 15:35:32 2015 UTC,"I worry that would punish better players with longer queue times.   I know it would encourage smurfing. Having a bad day? jump into your 30% w/r account and stomp a few games.  I'm also quite sure that skill-based mm won't change stompy, 15-5 games. That's more of a game design/map design thing. Certain maps are very biased towards one side (hello roughneck encounter). On top of that, tanks are very fast, and can die quickly. This means momentum is huge. If a team gets an early lead, you can capitalize quickly by taking key positions or outflanking the surviving members very quickly, which leads to more kills, and then more, and so on, leaving those last few holdouts wondering where their team went and blaming the matchmaker. I've never really thought of a succinct comparison between this and world of tanks, but I think I can sum it up in a word. speed. when tanks move faster, shoot faster, and aim faster, they die faster too. Doesn't matter if you're a 65% win rate player or a 45%. When you're surrounded by 5 enemy tanks with no backup, you die. 65%er's more likely to see it coming and take one or two with him, but he dies all the same."
ArmoredWarfare,3ch2fg,CitrusChrome,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:28:07 2015 UTC,"I worry that would punish better players with longer queue times.   That depends on the rules the MM works with. IT can be a tunable parameter that varies based on the current server population for example to maintain a certain queue time.   I know it would encourage smurfing. Having a bad day? jump into your 30% w/r account and stomp a few games.   Smurfing is definitely a problem. Even CS:GO, which is not F2P, has this problem. Wargaming and Valve have tried to limit this by forcing players to play PvE or an unranked game mode for a few hours first before being let into matchmade games.   I'm also quite sure that skill-based mm won't change stompy, 15-5 games.   You are right, it will not. But that should not be the goal of the MM. It should be to group together players of similar skill so that you have more fun and prolonged games and less stompy games on average."

If they equalize this tank with a shorter reload and lower alpha to achieve the exact same DPM, I'll be irritated. This tanks need a complete Rehaul."
ArmoredWarfare,3cfnss,TheAylius,2,Wed Jul 8 02:43:24 2015 UTC,"The issue is that you're taking away the uniqueness of the tank. There has to be something different other than the way it looks. T series got extremely high alpha to offset them from the other MBT's which are almost the exact same. high armor, mediocre pen, same alpha, 1 second difference in reload. Now what is going to set this thing apart?"
ArmoredWarfare,3cfnss,atriax,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:13:01 2015 UTC,"I argued the same point, but the tank that rolls for 900+ with AP, reluctant to say gets old when it gets a lucky penn on you. Mind you the T90 should and probably will still have higher Alpha when compared to the other MBT's, it just won't have near 1000. The uniqueness of the tank is in the playstyle, and it currently sucks balls at its playstyle. Every stat on this tanks screams its a brawler yet if you brawl with most tanks you risk certain death thanks to your lower front plate. Even with the ERA added on right now, it's one of the weaker T8's. It's got the T90MS's 2A46 Gun so I think it should get that modernization upgrade. As of right now it's significantly harder to carry and survive in the T90 when compared to the other MBT's. It's armor scheme certainly needs to be reworked and honestly for balance sake the gun should too if it's getting armor buffs and such."
ArmoredWarfare,3cfnss,TheAylius,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:37:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree, there are many ways to make a tank sufficiently different while keeping all the guns/ammo at the tier roughly the same.  Things that can help balance it are allowing upgrading up to the MS armor kit on the T-90, and differences in the armor scheme and all the other stats of the tanks.   Modern MBT's are very similar to one another, and that's fine. Let the MBT's be the ""simple"" class."

ArmoredWarfare,3cdxdr,Tntomer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:17:19 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the suggestion! Was quick and easy.
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,maruzana,4,Tue Jul 7 01:30:39 2015 UTC,"We've discussed guided rounds a lot, but it's hard to implement them in a way that wouldn't make gameplay for the opposition frustrating. We'll keep experimenting and see if we can find a system that is positive for gameplay."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Salaris,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:40:29 2015 UTC,"Have you guys also discussed cluster rounds for arty ? I would like a round as such that it does damage over a bigger surface, but a lot lower and this might go in tandem with the support role of the arty ."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Ketadine,3,Tue Jul 7 06:16:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we've talked about that type of thing. DPICM rounds are super cool, for example, but again it's mostly a gameplay concern - the larger the area of effect, the harder it would be for players to avoid even with the incoming artillery warning. It's definitely something we'll keep investigating."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Salaris,2,Tue Jul 7 07:55:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering! I really want them to be added, but if it not, I understand. :-)   I've also been reading up a bit and the Gvozdika is capable of firing chemical rounds. If the cluster rounds don't get added, how about these ""area of denial rounds"" ? It would create a damaging cloud for a set time, but be limited to a few uses for balancing reasons, similar to the smoke usage in other tanks. It would provide more variety and help in the support role for the arty."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Ketadine,2,Tue Jul 7 14:21:43 2015 UTC,"I like RPGish mechanics like that a lot, but I think it might feel too ""gamey"" for some people. In order to model that realistically, we'd probably have to figure out how to implement varying levels of NBC protection systems, which could get pretty complex.  Then there's also the legal and moral implications of chemical warfare - we'd have to be very careful about if that matches with the narrative of what we're trying to build for the player.   It's worth considering, but I wouldn't expect to see chemical rounds any time soon."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Salaris,2,Tue Jul 7 18:42:51 2015 UTC,How about an extra-weak(in damage) round but huge AOE for clearing destructible obstacles?  That could be super useful in many situations since AP can't go through anything right now.
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,ComradeHX,2,Thu Jul 9 10:46:14 2015 UTC,"The fences and such blocking shots isn't intentional. We're working on that, but it isn't as simple as flipping a global switch, unfortunately.  Huge AOEs also potentially have server performance and VFX ramifications. I'm not saying they're impossible, but it's something we're going to have to be very careful about. I do want to do some larger AOEs eventually.  We've talked about specialized rounds that are meant to destroy buildings, terrain, etc. but implementing them would be complex. That's another wishlist item for us."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Salaris,-4,Thu Jul 9 17:29:35 2015 UTC,We've discussed guided rounds a lot   And yet youve implemented guided missiles...
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,avalon304,2,Tue Jul 7 06:05:53 2015 UTC,"I should have been clearer. I meant guided artillery rounds, which would be considerably tougher to deal with from a balance standpoint.  ATGMs have a lot of counters, especially at higher tiers (ERA, APS, just getting out of the way, etc). Guided artillery rounds don't currently have as many counters available - and the fact that artillery is capable of indirect fire is already something that many players have a difficult time with.   I feel we've made this experience much better by adding artillery warnings and making artillery more about splash damage than massive burst damage, but adding guided artillery shells would have the potential to make things much worse from a gameplay standpoint if we're not extremely careful about it.  Edit: Similarly, we've avoided adding fire and forget ATGMs for the time being because of concerns that they would be frustrating to the targets. This is also something we've talked a lot about, but again, it would be damaging to gameplay if we're not careful about it."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Salaris,2,Tue Jul 7 07:53:08 2015 UTC,To go off on a slight tangent about the ATGM counters and specifically the counter to those counters in Tandem ATGM are they actually going to have a mechanic in-game that allows to work the way they do in real life?  As it is at the moment they do not work the way they are supposed to in that they are supposed to be able to ignore one block of ERA and still have the full penetration power after that.
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"It's possible we could change them in the future, but making them a hard counter to ERA like that might make the ERA packages on lighter vehicles lose a lot of their value. This is definitely something we'll continue to evaluate over time."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Salaris,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"Kind of defeats the purpose of calling those ATGM Tandem then, The whole point of Tandem is that it's designed to defeat ERA, So they are basically just normal ATGM with a misleading name at the moment."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:49:08 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, they already have a unique mechanic where they reduce the effective armor thickness of ERA by a percentage. It just doesn't cancel out the ERA completely."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Salaris,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"That's good to know, Just there's nothing in-game tooltip wise to suggest they act any differently."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:18:15 2015 UTC,I'll look into the tooltip.
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Salaris,2,Tue Jul 7 20:46:18 2015 UTC,Won't ERA/APS/getting out of the way still be effective against lock-on ATGM?  Which exact ATGMs were you referring to as fire-and-forget?  What would be broken is if tanks with fire-and-forget ATGM can indirectly fire at laser-designated target.
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,ComradeHX,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:10:38 2015 UTC,"ERA and APS would still work, but getting out of the way would most likely be much harder. It would depend on exactly how we implement them. We'd probably have to look for a more general countermeasure that anyone could use, like an upgraded version of smoke grenades that block the guidance, etc.  In terms of fire and forget ATGMs, I was thinking about things like the Spike LR). There are also laser guided missiles that we could potentially have set up as functioning similar to fire and forget, but we've chosen not to because of the gameplay ramifications."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Salaris,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"I think Spike or even laser homing LAHAT would be great additions.  Because you can have it so the lock-on time is longer than what it takes for MBT guns to aim; add a warning to that and people will still be able to get out of LOS(either cover or smoke) or have T-90 stare the missile to death.  I think the ability for other vehicles to laser-designate something for LAHAT to lock onto would be possibly broken, but that could just make AFV more useful.  Is there any plan to remove the ATGM warning?  Feels like it's a bit too much on top tier where APS is available.  And missiles in-flight are fairly visible unless looking the other way.  AFV is resorting to HE-spam with autocannons instead of ATGM most of time now."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,ComradeHX,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:27:03 2015 UTC,"We've tested homing missiles internally and they were fun for the attackers, but even with a lock-on time they felt tough to avoid. We'll keep trying them out, though. I'd love to find a way to make them work eventually.  We've discussed the ATGM warning a lot, but ultimately we'd rather make sure that players have a good chance to avoid the shots, and the warning is necessary for that in a broad enough variety of scenarios that we'd prefer to keep it in at the moment. Removing the warning could lead toward situations where people feel like they're getting hit - and hit hard - without any way of predicting it.  While we could probably ""safely"" disable the warning for vehicles that have adequate protection on their own without harming the gameplay of those vehicles, it's not really intuitive to disable a UI element like that for those vehicles, and having ERA or APS should feel like an advantage, not a trade off."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Salaris,3,Thu Jul 9 23:09:51 2015 UTC,"Tell me again how guided missiles bend over or around physical objects? Oh, they don't.  These rounds literally go around objects."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,atriax,-2,Tue Jul 7 06:11:49 2015 UTC,So... youve never seen Swingfires or Sheridans swing missiles around corners? Because thats a thing that happens...
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,avalon304,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:39:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but for guided missles you have to be exposed to fire them. For arty I already know several locations on the maps where you can fire behind cover with exposing yourself to the enemy, especially other arties."
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Ketadine,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:13:43 2015 UTC,guided missiles are literally worse than normal ammo  if you complain about them you must be pretty bad lol
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Finear,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:47:21 2015 UTC,"As gator already said, this would not make arty more accurate.  The only feature that would actually add to artillery is the ability to bend shells around hills and cover, which would be incredibly frustrating and annoying for anyone who isn't artillery."

ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,Sisaroth,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:45:35 2015 UTC,It might be kind of cool if we could get laser designated rounds in this game. Would be very interesting for team play.
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,TheScarlettHarlot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:00:46 2015 UTC,We will see if they ever make it in with specialist rounds. Until then we get to play with every flavor of high explosive.
ArmoredWarfare,3cdgai,1001111,0,Tue Jul 7 04:31:54 2015 UTC,"5m CEP. No different from a fully aimed arty in this game anyways.  If you're referring to ATR, then missiles should get it too."

ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,QuietTank,8,Mon Jul 6 03:58:15 2015 UTC,I hope that eventually the xp and cash rewards are balanced so that the two can be comparable.
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Popedizzle,3,Mon Jul 6 13:29:37 2015 UTC,"But then it would be too easy for the PVPers who buy a top tier premium tank when they only have 20 games played, or bot their way, or buy their account, or afk their way, or derp rush to complain about the scrub carebears who got their top tier tanks through PVE ruining their matches...  You know it's going to happen.  As if the people in top tier tanks who faceroll their way there are automatically granted skill."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,skyzefawlun,3,Mon Jul 6 20:13:37 2015 UTC,Seeing as they've implemented pretty good anti-idle stuff in the game I don't really see that happening. Also couldn't the person just buy a top tier premium tank and take it into PvP for roughly the same effect?
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Strader69,2,Tue Jul 7 00:34:58 2015 UTC,But then it would be too easy for the PVPers who buy a top tier premium tank when they only have 20 games played   You mean like I said in the first line of my comment?
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,skyzefawlun,3,Tue Jul 7 01:33:03 2015 UTC,"Good to hear that man!  I also had a bad streak yesterday playing my T-72 against T-80's, T-90's and other higher tier stuff.  Needless to say those monster usually two shotted me which lead to some mighty frustration."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Hombremaniac,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:06:07 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat, my highest tier tank is a BMP2. It's got 1093 health. The game is full of T80s that can potentially one-shot-kill me with their missiles. Being behind the progression curve is a bitch. I miss a few days of grinding and now I'm consistently bottom tier and being demolished over and over."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Highw4ySt4r,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:52:54 2015 UTC,"BMP-2 is my other favorite vehicle because i'm sucker for russian tech :).  Playing AFV is not always easy since when they spot me, I can be demolished in few seconds, but that somehow applies to MBT as well.  I guess when more folks play AW, then match maker will produce better results."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Hombremaniac,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:55:01 2015 UTC,"Not what I meant though. In your MBT you're being demolished by multiple enemies firing at you (which is acceptable, of course you meant to die when you're outnumbered).   In my BMP it only takes one enemy to fire at me for me to die. Only takes one lucky no-lifer that's 3 tiers higher than me. As you said, I guess it's just because of the small player numbers. The MM can't find many tier 8 players so they're all being dragged into my tier 5 battles - where they seal club and make tons of XP, getting even further ahead of me in the tech tree."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Highw4ySt4r,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:55:19 2015 UTC,"Well yes, I also saw many games with my tier7 against tiers 6-8.

ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Hombremaniac,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:19:56 2015 UTC,You two shot lower tier tanks as well. Why don't you look at it that way?

ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Hombremaniac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it is going to be fine when there are lots of playerbase. It is hard for MM to organize games with 100 players on a server, so it throws random tiers with each other.  WOT had the same problems before."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Beav3r,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:00:10 2015 UTC,"I guess you are right.  Still this lead to subpar experience and can very negatively influence people's opinion.  Maybe those top tier folks should play some lower tiers as well, when there is not enough of high tiers online. 3 levels advantage = seal clubbing fest."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Hombremaniac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:20:12 2015 UTC,"Dude, when you'll be in the PT against tier 7 then we can talk :-) . It happened to me only once and I manage to steal 2 kills, but OMG did the MM screw me majorly.  But yes, in the case of PvP, AW suffers from the same issues as WoT: lemming trains, afkers and bad MM sometimes. Besides improving the MM and the maps, I hope the devs can do something about incentivizing the players to do better in a match. If they add some sort of personal missions that you can do, but also be beneficial to the match, it would be awesome. The current ones from WoT seem lackluster to say the least and the higher level ones are kinda selfish."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Ketadine,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:34:47 2015 UTC,I really wonder if devs can spice things up a bit even with spotting system. Also I hope that the retrofit system will not be only about slapping picture on your vehicle and thats it.
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Hombremaniac,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:34:00 2015 UTC,I was thinking that the retrofit system would be about added a bit of extra armour or something.  Personally I'd like to see bonuses luke 5% of crew skills or 2% increased credit income.
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,AGreekGod,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:50:15 2015 UTC,"I think many folks hoped for customisation in terms of added ERA, maybe better fire control system and such.  Basically turning stock tanks into what certain countries did (Czech rep's t-72m4cz, Poland's PT-91 etc)"
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Hombremaniac,2,Tue Jul 7 14:21:17 2015 UTC,I think that is what AW should do. It would be kinda cool if the added ERA and electronic systems could increase the tank by a whole tier or increase the battle rating to be in line with one tier higher.

I think i did like half a dozen pvp matches, just to get some more ep and credits for a new tank but the rest of the time i just ran the missions over and over again. I just enjoy cooperative PvE more than PvP in those kinds of games.  After playing WoT and WT so much, the interest in pvp is just gone.   regarding angry comments in pve: i saw tons of them, mostly because people would go afk, suicide or leave after the first of 3 missions."

If you guys could get it as refined as say, EVE's mission system, I'd be dropping the competition for you guys.  It was a huge breath of fresh air even in that first release iteration."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Salaris,2,Tue Jul 7 13:37:52 2015 UTC,Glad you enjoyed it! We're working hard to make PVE better and better. I'm very excited about it.
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Highw4ySt4r,2,Tue Jul 7 18:47:11 2015 UTC,"I'm in two minds about the xp/credit rewards for PvE. On the one hand they're totally not worth it from a points-per-minute perspective. You often spend longer in a PvE session than you do in a single PvP match, but you earn less rewards. So per minute rewards are better in PvP.  However, I know that if both modes had equal points-per-minute then I'd play PvE exclusively because it's more consistent. You don't get fail teams in PvE. So the rewards are likely to be the same each time, whereas in PvP you can have complete disasters and earn nothing.   I imagine many ""power gamers"" like myself (people that go for the fastest and most efficient grinds as possible) would abandon PvP if PvE earned more rewards. Not good."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,Highw4ySt4r,2,Tue Jul 7 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"Not good.   Not a great result, but not necessarily terrible. After all, PVE is the one clear standout feature AW has from the competition. The better supported it is, the better game will do imo.  It would potentially split the playerbase though, which is never great. One option might be avoid that would reward each mode differently, like PVE gives more credits while PVP gives more XP. That would encourage people to play both modes a bit, but it downsides as well."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,dokterbeefcake,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:20:47 2015 UTC,"If PvE paid just as much as PvP, it wouldn't just split the community, it'd kill PvP overnight."

ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,MainerZ,3,Tue Jul 7 12:52:42 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, I'd get ripped apart right at the start of match before I could even get a shot of (I was almost always on the lower tier).   I can't help but read this sentence and think that you've been playing quite badly yourself. There will never be a game where you cannot do at least 1 shot of damage, hell you should be able to pump out a decent amount if you can see your team crumbling. Are you rushing? If you know you are bottom tier, do you not hold back a little and support/snipe? It matters not if your team gets stomped, if you can crawl back some damage and spotting then you at least gain something from it."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,OrangeDreamed,3,Mon Jul 6 08:44:04 2015 UTC,"I was playing badly in quite a few of those matches. I'm a bit out of practice, haven't played WoT in at least a year and WT in about 5 months. Another issue is I've always been a heavy tank player. The Tiger 2, the Sherman Jumbo, the T29/32/34, those were my favorite and best tanks from WoT.   I love my armor, and the Leopard 1 has none. I've honestly had a lot of trouble adapting to it, and really don't know quite how to make the most out of it. At the start of the match I struggle to figure out where to go. I've tried going into urban fights, but it just doesn't have the armor to brawl. I've tried going into more open areas, but either I get their after the lights have already done the work or no scouts go that way and get spotted and smashed before I can get into to cover. That, and to be honest I was just losing my cool and not thinking in some matches because I was frustrated by all the other loses.  The last PVP match I had was representative of my worst matches this weekend. It was on the urban winter map, and I started to head for the city. So did the entirety of my team. So I started going to the other flank, and a Chieftain and LAV-300 joined me. We started to roll up a bit, not too far, trying to find a good defensive position. Then the chieftain gets hit, I get spotted, and I instantly get smashed by 3 shots. I tried to rush into cover but got hit by an ATGM. Probably didn't help that it was a tier 7 match and our flank had no scouts.  Not all of my matches were like that, and there were plenty where I did decently and got decent damage, but the longer the weekend lasted and the longer my streak got the worse I played. Except in PVE."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,VexatiousOne,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"If you play more mediums and light tanks, you'll be able to adapt those tactics a lot more in AW. There's not a whole lot of heavy style play here since side scraping is almost completely pointless, and Hull down is only somewhat as effective.   If you were ever able to get a Leo in WoT, you would be able to play if perfectly here, skirting round the edge of view ranges to snipe and flank. It is nowhere near a front line tank. Don't thing that because you can't roll up with the Bigger boys that you are cowardly, you are their fire support. And you will rinse everything that isn't directly targeting you.   Don't go to the front, but be in a position to spring into action on the flank of what's hitting your main force.   Play more meds in WoT, heavy tanks will teach you nothing about fast plays and flanking."
ArmoredWarfare,3c9k2k,BulkZerker,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"Side scraping is actually pretty good, especially when you're playing the m60 patton, which has pretty shoddy front armor against higher tiers."

If that does not work(which it did not for me)  This will help you sir.   http://aw.my.com/en/forum/showthread.php?12765-How-To-Increase-FPS-Performance-in-Armored-Warfare&highlight=nvidia  Follow the NVidia control panel steps.   Now here's a way that SHOULD & WILL IMPROVE PERFORMANCE!  Open up Nvidia Control Panel. Under ""3D Settings"" click ""Adjust image settings with preview"" then make sure ""Let the 3D application decide"" is marked.  Now click ""Configure Surround, PhysX"".  Make sure PhysX is set to your GPU if you don't have a dedicated PhysX card (which most people don't, so don't worry about it).   Under 3D Settings Go to ""manage 3D settings"" Wait for it to load and select AW from the drop-dwon (if it does not show up, add a new one and find the .exe for the game) Change Antialiasing Mode to ""override application setting"" Change Antialiasing Setting to whatever you want, I use 2xMSAA+MFAA for best performance Click apply, wait a second for it to save."

However I would have to disagree on the warrior, I am not a fan of the vehicle as it is quite large and difficult to control. It does not play like the scorpion at all...  It is the scorpion chasis that i am keen on. Will the scimitar be an retrofit of the scorpion?  Also, the warrior feels completely out of place. It is in the wrong tree (swingfire-vbl-wiesel-warrior).   The first and last vehicles in this line are played nothing like the mid two. I think the swingfire should be put in the TD line and a small scout should take its place."

The Scimitar will most likely be a separate vehicle from the Scorpion, not an upgrade. I can't make any guarantees at this early of a stage, but typically if a vehicle has a different designation we build it as a separate vehicle.  As for the vehicle lines, we're still moving things around. We don't have enough vehicles in the game to make every line 100% perfect at the moment - that's why there are gaps in certain lines and some vehicles feel somewhat out of place."

ArmoredWarfare,3c924r,Ketadine,2,Mon Jul 6 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"sigh  Multiple = having or involving several parts, elements, or members.   at least two people agree so far.  I can count several more that I know would agree, and the general consensus on the AW forums is that it's a great tank.   Good = having the qualities required for a particular role; to be desired or approved of.   The Scorpion is fast, small, stealthy, and agile.  It has a gun that's both punchy, accurate, and quick to reload.  It can only shoot HE, true, but against the tanks you'll be facing it is more than enough.  All of these are attributes you can agree are 'good'.   Easy = achieved without great effort; presenting few difficulties.   Scorpion can get to wherever you want quickly and easily.  Once you're there... aim and shoot.  That's pretty much it.  If you want to get more complicated... then it has good depression you can abuse, and where needed, you can skirt around and flank those big, mean MBTs.  Not only that, but the sloped front tends to be a tad trolly against early-tier autocannons, good for a few bounces that can confound them.  Don't see how any of that is difficult.   Solid amount = No dictionary definition, but contextual.  In this case... let's say at least its own HP as a minimum to do well; solid is 1.5-2x.   That is quite easy to achieve in the Scorpion.  2k damage, as was mentioned before, is fairly easy if you aren't suiciding in it.  Take your time, pick your shots, and you can farm damage on the no-armored tier 1s and 2s all day long."
ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,Ketadine,6,Mon Jul 6 08:26:02 2015 UTC,"It's fine. It's not supposed to pen, as the description says ""use HE for targets you cannot pen with other ammunition"".

ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,Sisaroth,2,Mon Jul 6 10:33:44 2015 UTC,"HEAT is nice, but I found that you tend to overpenetrate and not do max damage. Plus some vehicles do not have access to them like the Scorpion or the auto cannons which fire incendiary rounds."
ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,Sisaroth,3,Mon Jul 6 11:58:19 2015 UTC,I don't understand completely yet how overpen works. Sometimes it seems like they do more damage than normal hits.
ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,theycallhimthestug,2,Mon Jul 6 12:11:26 2015 UTC,Are you talking about overmatch?
ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,TheScarlettHarlot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:27:33 2015 UTC,It seems over pens have a chance of passing through with no damage.
ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,Salaris,7,Mon Jul 6 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"There's no mechanic for this happening in Armored Warfare.   ""Overmatch"" means your shell automatically penetrated because the caliber of your gun is so high compared to the armor thickness of the location. It has no effect on damage.  There are, however, points on vehicles that do modified damage to the target. For example, there are hatches and cupolas that deal less than 100% damage on a hit, and there are also weak points like engine grills where you deal more than 100% damage on a hit.  Because some of these points can be overmatched, it can lead to the perception that overmatch itself has a damage modifier.  It's also possible to hit armor locations that don't actually lead into the vehicle itself - like just a thick chunk of applique armor. You'll see ""no effect"" or ""pass through"" on these types of surfaces.  We're looking for better ways to clear up hit feedback to make this system a little more intuitive."
ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,TheScarlettHarlot,3,Tue Jul 7 04:44:18 2015 UTC,I was confusing overmatch with overpenetration. Thanks for the clarification!

ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,bchans,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:45:04 2015 UTC,"Overmatch seems pretty self explanatory to me, if someones confused about it, a 5 second google lookup shows it and teaches them what it means.  like http://ruhrpottpatriot.tumblr.com/post/73235077911/crash-course-tanks-overmatching-and-why-some  If you had a built in glossery in the game, like a terminology guide and mechancis explanation, that would be smart.   WoT, you have to leave the program to find these kinds of things out, if AW enabled the players to learn and get the answers to all thier questions without leaving the game, would be good, I bet video game reviewers would talk about your game having that feature and your competitors not having it."

ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,smartuy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:09:50 2015 UTC,"How do APFSDS rounds overmatch? By definition, overmatch refers to the shell mass being so great that it simply tears through armor.

In real life, it's not usually used for much more than clearing obstacles and demolishing enemy structures.  The shells themselves are made with very thin walls and tips to pack as much explosive into them as possible, which explains their low penetration. They don't have armored caps to punch through armor."
ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,TheScarlettHarlot,-7,Mon Jul 6 09:55:57 2015 UTC,"I understand, but this a game and I want to pen really light armored vehicles like arties and scouts, not just splash them."
ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,theycallhimthestug,5,Mon Jul 6 11:57:08 2015 UTC,"I think this may be an anti-frustration feature for exactly those scenarios, HE is used for targets you are unable to penetrate, not targets you are likely to overpenetrate -- By using this mechanic, we avoid lightly armored vehicles getting killed instantly by everything. It just promotes a less campy gameplay style where movement and taking risks is not as heavily penalised."
ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,Gatortribe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:57:27 2015 UTC,"Is it so, not penalised ? If I'm in a Scorpion and the enemy is in a M60, my splash would do a max of 80 and a min of 10 which is laughable tbh (these examples actually happened to me with direct hits). On the other hand I got (probably overpenned) for ~ 300. As a light vehicle, this is penalizing.  I guess in the end my issue with HE is it's randomness in damage not exactly pen rating. It's really annoying that you can't know if you'll do consistent damage or not."

This also cuts both ways, if you increase the penetration of HE but removes the ""splash"" - You're removing the little tickle damage some vehicles is able to do to MBT's and the like."

ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,BulkZerker,2,Mon Jul 6 14:55:50 2015 UTC,"Just use HEAT, it deals more damage anyway. HE variations are only for guaranteed damage and modules."
ArmoredWarfare,3ca5nc,smartuy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:25:06 2015 UTC,"HE's role in this game isn't to do damage, and the devs have even showed this with their damage ratings. HE, and Especially HESH are designed to destroy modules in this game. If you hit lesser armor, you'll get more damage, but it will also destroy many more modules. I hit a T80 on the turret ring with HESH in the Chieftan, I only did 30 damage but it knocked out his gun, turret ring, both tracks, the optics, and breach. It's not useless, it's just very situational, and HE spam would negate armor even more which is the purpose for MBT's to exist."

There is a common pitfall: if you don't know something fully, you don't have the very tools required the realize you don't know it.   My personal approach to the game is as a student, regardless how good I get, my decision making and OODA cycle are always up for scrutiny.  http://wotlabs.net/articles/decision-processing-the-ooda-loop/  You should not be frustrated from the experience of learning. Frustration means that some assumptions you are making are false - you expect one thing, something else happens, you are frustrated.  Being frustrated with your own play means your play is fundamentally wrong - you don't perform the OODA loop consistently, and don't keep a student mindset.   When you make a mistake as a student, when your experiment fails, it's a moment for elation, not frustration, because you learn a lesson.  OODA loop is there to minimize the repetition of mistakes.   I am telling you this from personal experience - regardless of skill level, whenever I get lazy with analysis and go on tilt, frustration follows.   It's not that fun to watch someone frustrated.  TL:DR - Don't assume you know everything, assume you know less than half, and check the facts frequently.

I posted a SS of it to the feedback forums on the first day."

ArmoredWarfare,3c6uep,atriax,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:29:47 2015 UTC,Inaccuracy is bad in all MBTs. I miss shots from 30 meters away fully aimed CONSTANTLY because the round goes straight into the dirt. It's one of the biggest issues with MBT's after broken armor profiles. Their accuracy is just so fucking bad compared to tds/lights that fire lasers while moving. Meanwhile MBT's have to sit still for 8 seconds to have a chance in hell at hitting anything.

In EA2 I was making almost every shot, even when by all rights I probably should not have based on the recital. All of a sudden in EA3 even fully upgraded, fully leveled drivers, with the crosshairs as small as they get I am missing shots (going into the dirt, going bat shit wild) that should hit. I don’t know what it is, if something was tweaked or what but the LEO-1 has an issue.  On the plus side that annoying ass “delayed stop rocking” problem I had with the T64 seems to be gone."

In a tank with a auto-cannon use HE ammo, but only when it's save (when they just shot or when you are not spotted). The damage is not enough to make it worth taking a shot back from them.  In the scorpion just shoot HE/HESH also try not to get hit. It has better view range and is faster than the MBTs so use that to your advantage.   In M60/T62. Shoot their lower plate with AP, cupola on M60 is also a spot you can pen. T62 can be penned also in the cupola but it's a little harder. The turret ring can usually be penned."

ArmoredWarfare,3c4b7c,TheAylius,2,Sat Jul 4 19:38:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah you pretty much want to stick with kinetic penetration when fighting MBTs.    HEAT is going to have difficulties penetrating even on the side in some cases.    EDIT: Just checked the Ramka-99's penetration, and its HEAT ATGM can penetrate up to 976mm. So it can easily penetrate the frontal hull armor of most of the MBTs and even the frontal turret armor of some of them."
ArmoredWarfare,3c4b7c,AGreekGod,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:05:16 2015 UTC,"On the mid tiers (especially tier 5) you can almost fire HEAT exclusively (I do that on M60A3 and T-72), but I carry a healthy amount of AP rounds to pen stuff like tier 7 tanks, ERA or those annoying T-72 side skirts"
ArmoredWarfare,3c4b7c,AGreekGod,-1,Sat Jul 4 20:14:16 2015 UTC,The reflex cannot penetrate most MBT's mainly because of the HEAT and SC multipliers and the existence of APS's.
ArmoredWarfare,3c4b7c,Brovich,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:41:46 2015 UTC,"SC = HEAT    Did you look at my doc? I calculated out all of the multipliers. The 9M119M Refleks has a penetration value of 1,092mm currently.    The frontal hull armor of the Leo 2a5 is 950mm vs HEAT. The Abrams frontal hull armor is 960mm vs HEAT. The C1 Ariete has frontal hull armor of 724mm vs HEAT.    So the Refleks shouldnt break much sweat penetrating these. The only thing that will get in the way is APS systems, depending if all charges have been used or if they are on cool down."
ArmoredWarfare,3c4b7c,Brovich,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:02:14 2015 UTC,How does the APS work in  this game?
ArmoredWarfare,3c4b7c,smartuy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:08:06 2015 UTC,It deflects shots from ATGMs. They have a limited amount of charges as well as cool downs associated with their use.

ArmoredWarfare,3c4b7c,smartuy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:07:15 2015 UTC,What is not factored in is the slope of the plate. The T-90s front plate slope increases its front on thickness by at least a factor of 2.   So   421.6 * 2 = 840+  694.4 * 2 = 1390+

ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,TheAylius,11,Fri Jul 3 05:29:53 2015 UTC,"It's too early for me to properly assess the balance of the tier 8s at the moment. We haven't gotten used to fighting these tanks, it's new for all of us and we need to give ourselves some time to figure things out. So far, yes the 2A5 is probably OP, but the M1A1, when fighting it frontally, is just about as tough. It also doesn't have the gunner sight, instead offering an easier to hit turret ring. The ring is by no means easy to hit. I just urge you not to listen to what auranight says about this tank, he is... fond of it, to say the least. He won't be satisfied until the tank is impervious all around and hits for 2000. With the DU kit, I can see this tank being much more problematic frontally. I do think the Ariete is a bit too heavily armored, considering they said it has little armor and is basically the same as fighting a Challenger.   With that said, I can see the trend of what you want. You want the MBTs to be like WoT heavies, riddled with weak spots from the front that anybody can shoot with little thinking. That's not how MBTs are, however. Every modern MBT (esp. Western) is designed to be immune to almost everything from the front. If this was real life, the gunner sight on the 2A5 would never do damage. It was actually moved up there to make it so it wasn't a weak spot, but the developers decided to make it so the lower bits of it are just to give the tank a weak spot. In game you also said the Challenger 1 was OP, so it's clear you're against MBTs being, well MBTs. If anything, the MBTs should have armor. These tier 8s and the Challenger are the first MBTs that actually play like what you'd expect from one. If the Leopard 2 had functioning armor and the M1 didn't have a fucked up model, they would have performed like MBTs. Instead they were just moving weak spots, which as an MBT means you can't enjoy yourself.   If the game becomes what you're asking for- MBTs have gigantic weak spots- I'll be glad to just play lights since MBTs will be completely irrelevant. You forget that MBTs are supposed to be good at everything and the other classes are niche, not vice versa (as it is before tier 8)."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Gatortribe,3,Fri Jul 3 08:30:20 2015 UTC,"Hah, it's fine MBTs are impenetrable from the front. I don't mind that. But the 2A5s I've encountered in my BMP-3M result in me being unable to pen at all from the sides unless I get lucky with an ATGM into the side in their turret ring and if their APS is on cool down. Also, because of the traverse rate I barely get any shots on the rear by the time I flank. I'm forced to use the 100mm HE-Frag all the time, hope I hit a softer spot of the tank, and hope I roll high for non-pen damage.   Edit: Just realized I should have made clear, I cannot pen with my 30mm at all from the side. ATGMs are iffy due to APS and other protections given unless I thread a shot into the turret ring from the side. Which leaves only the 100mm HE-Frag I described above."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,MotherTruckinMexican,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:51:05 2015 UTC,"You can't approach them alone and you shouldn't be able to solo then, in my opinion. You and Veruc had to attack me at the same time (and when you did, I was screwed) otherwise I would just roll over you. MBTs should be a threat to troop carriers, as they're not designed to take them on, they're support vehicles."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Gatortribe,4,Fri Jul 3 18:32:27 2015 UTC,"What you're implying is that if a team has more MBTs it should win cause the other classes are irrelevant. This isn't a tank sim, man. This is an arcade game, where gameplay balance is more important than ""IRL"". They may be support vehicles, yeah, but it doesn't mean the team with more AFVs should roll over and just die. My issue is that if in my AFV I flanked you, I should be able to pen. Hitting your sides should result in some penetrating hits. Hitting your rear should result in all penetrating hits. The fact that none of my shots penned you on the side after dumping my entire clip is...disappointing."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,MotherTruckinMexican,2,Fri Jul 3 21:06:43 2015 UTC,"I was very surprised when none of them penned, honestly. I'm not asking for what you're saying, I'm just asking for it not to be the opposite of ""more MBTs=win"". At the moment, more MBTs puts you at a disadvantage. If the other team has more AFVs, you already lost an entire flank before the game started. I'd rather have a team full of high vision tanks than a team full of MBTs who won't ever know what hit them.   It's quite well known that the developers do want MBTs to be the main role in this game, with all the others designed to support them. That's the reasoning behind them being blind as hell, slow, and inaccurate on the move. The only thing they have is armor and guns. Oh, wait. You don't get armor until tier 7/8 (M60A3 aside). Also, light tanks outgun you and are vastly more accurate.   I'm sure I'm just rambling at this point. I'm just happy that MBTs are finally worth something at tier 8, having been dead weight before that. Maybe I won't have to only play lights when the game goes live."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Gatortribe,2,Fri Jul 3 21:21:11 2015 UTC,"I don't see a lot of actual disagreement in this exchange here. MBTs should be really strong from the front, and not have a lot of gimmicky weakspots ""because reasons"" like WoT, but AFVs in general haven't gained proportional strength up the tiers to justify using them over a pure scout for vision, or a light tank for 360noscope damage ability. Hell, even the 100mm HE cannon many of the AFVs get doesn't fire much faster than guns on MBTs, and forget about trying to shoot twice at high tier lights."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Veruc_US,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:41:19 2015 UTC,"What you're implying is that if a team has more MBTs it should win cause the other classes are irrelevant.   Thats what I said.   I'm not asking for what you're saying, I'm just asking for it not to be the opposite of ""more MBTs=win"".   Thats what you said.  You lost me on how you said that you are not asking for what I am saying.  Right now I wouldn't say so much that its MBTs are at a disadvantage because of spotting ranges. I would say it is the extremely large (700m) draw range on the small 1000 by 1000 maps we play on nightly. Along with so many areas to sit back and snipe in I could see why people feel weak in MBTs. Fortunately with the recent nerfs in view range and what seems to be a max spotting distance (the orange circle on your minimap) I would wait a bit before claiming that high view range tanks would be an easy win against a team composed of mostly MBTs.   It's quite well known that the developers do want MBTs to be the main role in this game, with all the others designed to support them.   Do you have a source for this? I would like to see it.  Regarding LTs, right now they just have too good alpha for their reload along with a crazy class bonus of no bloom while on the move. Surely there will be changes coming to LTs because of this. The VFM comes to mind first for this.  MBTs are just too...ridiculous at tier 8. The T-90 could certainly use an armor buff. However the alpha for all the tier 8 tanks is 750+ which is...a bit much IMO. If you could convince me otherwise that would be great.  Anyway, yeah I'm getting off topic. All I am saying is that if I flank your MBT, I deserve to pen it with my AFV. Its ridiculous for an AFV to bounce all its shots on the side/rear of an MBT. To say that is balanced is wrong."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,MotherTruckinMexican,0,Fri Jul 3 22:19:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I typed that up in a hurry and didn't really stop to think.   MBTs have long been at a disadvantage due to low view range, and on maps such as Roughneck it is highly advantageous to have more AFVs (or Stingrays, since it now has more view range than quite a few AFVs). On River Point, you can only go the 8 line and then back to base. If you exit on the enemy side, tanks with superior view range will spot you from the back of their base and subsequently melt you.  I realize that most of the problems spur from poor map design. There's a lot that's poorly designed in this game (although the good outweighs it).   They call MBTs the ""Basic core element in Armored Warfare"""
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Gatortribe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:42:45 2015 UTC,"Based on the link you gave me yeah MBTs are supposed to be blind due to, as the video put it, having ""armor, stamina, and fire power"".  Nowhere in the video does it say they want everything else to be built around MBTs. By basic core element, it sounds like it would be your most common and easiest to get into tank type. This is reflected in what they're saying about MBTs in the video when they're referring to pushing and staying power.   The video basically says every tank has its role and how obsidian wants those tanks to perform. In short, nothing close to what you suggested of ""building the other classes around MBTs to support them"". Although I can see why it's easy to think that when taken out of context from a video.  Edit: Forgot to include this bit but yeah those situations you described sound like you having an issue with being situationally bad and no map control. MBTs are supposed to have the worst view range (according to the video) and worst camo (source:video). So it makes sense you'd get spotted fairly quickly. This is where having hard cover helps, which a map like River Point has on both the 8 line and 1/2 line if you choose to push it.   Oh and naturally if your team has map control that significantly helps too. Based on personal experience people tend to camp in AW (goes back to large draw range small map issue). Even I do it sometimes too cause its easier to hit people with missiles that way. Unfortunately that's not how a team acquires map control usually."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,MotherTruckinMexican,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:10:05 2015 UTC,"I suppose I probably misinterpreted it, but by having no perk it seems they feel it's supposed to do everything relatively well (other than view range).  Anyways, I talked to Jinxx about this thread and he agrees with me that MBTs should have excellent frontal armor. He said he wants them to push, not snipe. He also said he's confused now that some people don't want them to have armor."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Gatortribe,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"Well I don't think I ever said in this discussion that MBTs should have weak fronts. In fact the first thing I said is that MBTs should be impenetrable from the front. I never said they should snipe. I hope Jinxx does read this thread. All I want is for AFVs to pen sides/rear with their autocannon because right now you can't do that as you know first hand when I fired at your side.  Well their perk seems to be strong armor, guns that pen everything, and high HP. Does there need to be more?"
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,MotherTruckinMexican,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"So, whats wrong with the M1 model? I've only gotten to the M60 and T62, so I have no idea how the higher tiers play.  What else needs to be done to make the MBT's feel like MBT's?"
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,QuietTank,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:38:45 2015 UTC,"The M1 (and M1A1) have ""winged"" turret cheeks. Instead of being parallel to the ground, they point up on each side. It just doesn't look right and makes the turret ring extremely easy to hit."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Gatortribe,-1,Fri Jul 3 16:22:49 2015 UTC,Will people please listen to this instead of OP?
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Terrachova,0,Fri Jul 3 13:26:40 2015 UTC,"If you looked at my ""to fix"" sections for all tanks I gave multiple options. I said for the 2A5 and Areite that they offer no weakpoints and I compared them to tanks that did. I have a problem with this since there are the tanks with no weak points and tanks WITH weak points. I don't want MBT's to be riddled with weak points, I want MBT's to be balanced fairly. I said I wanted tanks to have ""consistent"" weakspots. The M1A1's turret ring is at least a consistent weakpoint. The 2A5 is lacking any of these. I understand from a realism standpoint the 2A5 is a behemoth and shouldn't, but that's not balanced in the slightest. If a T90 or M1A1 go into the middle section in roughneck and sit there, they die in 30 seconds. A Leo2a5 and Ariete can sit there, not move a muscle and not get penned by anything in game unless flanked.   Having 2 out of the 4 be impervious from the front makes the other two completely pointless. And at that rate, if they're nigh impervious to their own tier then how will tanks that of lower tier be able to fight them? It will be a cake walk. I brought up the T90MS idea which could put the T90 up the Leo2A5 and Arietes level. I also said the Challenger 1 was overpowered in game, because having an innate lack of weakpoints in its armor and not being able to be frontally penetrated anywhere makes it that those tanks can dictate the terms of combat whenever and however they want. If you have the ability to dictate combat not by your positioning or map smarts but by your overkill armor, then that is unbalanced. There are possibly a lot of ways to balance the game right now for tier 8's, but even you have to admit that right now it is nowhere near balanced and that's what I'm trying to get ideas for. I'm against some MBT's being impervious while the others get riddled with weakspots. That's called unbalanced."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Gatortribe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:56:29 2015 UTC,"The gunner sight is the weak spot on all three of those tanks. It's smaller on the 2A5, but it's pretty easy to hit on a Challenger and C1.   I don't know how you have an easy time against M1A1s, I fucking struggle against them. That turret ring is not reliable, IMO. With the M1 you just had to shoot under the turret and profit. You can't do that anymore.   I do believe the T-90 may need the MS upgrade, but I'm not gonna say it for sure. You don't have the top gun, so you don't know how it will perform."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Gatortribe,0,Fri Jul 3 18:35:25 2015 UTC,"Although that is correct, the T90's penetration at top AP is still less than the T80 had last test, and even then that couldn't get an orange penn on a challenger 1. If the MBT's are going to be frontally impenetrable, then they should all have that ability. Both you and I know if a 2A5 and a T90 came up against each other, T90 would lose 10/10. The 2A5 has a really iffy visor(I shot yours like 6 times, penned twice and did 100-200 a shot while the 2A5(hell a 2AV) can repeatedly penetrate my turret ring next to the shtora or My LFP over and over and over. I struggled keeping my HP up when a normal Leo2 came up to me I almost lost to it just because he was consistently penning my LFP while his turret was orange and his Lower plate was bobbing all around. My LFP can be penned at over an 80 degree angle. If the MS upgrade is applied it will be at the same level as the Ariete and 2A5, and the lower plate will be gone. It's just that since this weak spot exists, there is no reason to drive this thing over a 2A5. The lack of HP and armor makes direct combat so so so much more dangerous and it cancels out the guns advantage over other guns. I'm fine with MBT's being impen to everything else, but when it's MBT vs MBT they should be able to fight frontally even if it is sketchy as all hell IE M1A1"
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Sisaroth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:51:59 2015 UTC,"I could compromise and say that the gunner sight needs to be a bit bigger on the 2A5 (the hitbox). If that happens, however, the T-90 and the Abrams both need to keep their turret rings (assuming the T-90 gets an armor kit that helps the lower hull). Otherwise, we'll be playing role reversal and an LFP-down T-90 will be impenetrable.   I don't disagree when you say the T-90 is under powered- every T-90 driver has said that thus far, so I'm inclined to agree with you. The penetration doesn't need buffed though, you were just spoiled by the T-80 having mind boggling amounts of penetration. The 2A5 has 528 pen with the top round, which is 7mm less than the T-90s first APFSDS upgrade and 19 less than its top round. The T-80 had better penetration than every single tier 8 aside from the C1 (why the fuck does this have 600?!) and M1128."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Fracton,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:42:01 2015 UTC,"That was my entire argument in the first place. Back in test 1 and two I was loudly advocating for the Leopard 2AV and Chieftan to be buffed both armor and gun wise. A leopard 2 of any kind shouldn't have been that week. And I also agreed that the T80 had horrifyingly overkill penetration, which is why I advocated for the penetration Nerf. This has improved all MBT's armor in general and makes weak spots just that much more important. If the T90 gets the MS kit than it CERTAINLY should get a weak turret ring. Hell if it gets the MS upgrade, give it a whole new ring hitbox since it will be the main place to shoot. I'm not looking for role reversal, I'm Looking for equality in terms of armor practicality across all tiers. The Abrams should remain the same since it gets the DU upgrade. The only weakpoints that should be made larger (for example your 2A5's visor) should only be penneble by same tier or higher tier MBT's."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,OfensiveBias,2,Fri Jul 3 20:02:28 2015 UTC,So my prediction was right :p.   BMPT looks like it will be hell to take down if the whole upper part only takes half damage.
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Fracton,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:54:36 2015 UTC,"I fought a few so far. If you're in an MBT and you face hug it you can aim down in a section above the UFP and below the main turret where it's an autopen, also you can just shoot the weak soviet LFP. It's a bitch in the right hands, but it's not invincible."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,OfensiveBias,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:29:44 2015 UTC,"Just a quick note, the Ramka actually has better armor than the T90 in reality, and its built on the T-72 chassis, not the T-90's, and the ERA is the Relikt, not Kontakt-5."
ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,Fracton,7,Fri Jul 3 12:54:35 2015 UTC,"The only production Ramkas used the T90A chassis. Since the T90 chassis is a continuation of the T-72 chassis, many sources fail to differentiate between the two."

ArmoredWarfare,3bykqj,defeatedbird,3,Fri Jul 3 14:06:27 2015 UTC,"military-today   The BMPT uses chassis of the T-90 main battle tank.   kampfpanzer.de   To add as much passive protection as possible, the BMPT is using the T-90A hull. This includes a strengthened hull structure, additional mine protection and an upgraded suspension.   An additional feature to note, the BMPT uses the V92S2 engine, which is only available as an upgrade to certain models of T-72, but is the default engine of the T-90 and T-90a."

In front-line Russian service T-72 are being replaced by T-90, a modernized version of the T-72. In Ukraine, T-72s are supposed to be replaced by the T-84 MBTs.

You may wanna contemplate how you're voting with your money. Think about the shit that would have caused complete outrage when the gaming industry wasn't pure cancer, and now you somehow feel is super nice and royally generous. That's what spoiled twerps like you have done by throwing money at grabbing schemes like this.  You actually tried to justify this shit by pointing out EA's practices. That's like saying ebola is a little better than getting melted in a volcano. And paying some asshole for it.  Think about this: what they DID promise was a F2P game like WoT, but better. One of those two promises is looking pretty good, but the F2P half should be throwing up red flags all over the place, because the only way to play right now, is to pay.

ArmoredWarfare,3bw6ls,984198,8,Fri Jul 3 05:01:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, You're one of those people who still hasn't grasped the basic concept that you're not paying to Test the game, you are paying for the premium content that was the entire basis of the founders packs. The Early access IS NOT THE POINT OF THE PACKS, and if you think it is you are so epicly stupid that nothing I say will ever sink in through your granite like density.   If YOU bought the founders pack purely on the idea that you were paying just for early access then you're a moron. I researched the game, researched the devs, checked the packages and researched the pricing on them once I had decided that the game would be good enough to give a shot. Early access was a bonus that turned out to thoroughly surprise me as I expected it to be in a much worse state than it was.   I paid the Devs for two reasons. One because I liked the items and the discount in the top package. Secondly because after doing months of research on the game and the devs I felt that they were a pretty safe choice for making a good product, which they have already proven in spades.   the F2P aspect is fine and an extremely common model. You're saying that paying is the only way to test right now which is also patently false. They just gave away over 1000 keys today alone and have been releasing keys to people for testing for months now. How the fuck do you think all the testers around the world were playing before early access?   If anything the F2P model they have shows so far is extremely fair and doesn't nickle and dime you for every thing in the game, like changing a crewmans name, or buying more tanks requiring you to purchase more slots, etc.   You sound like you're just a poorfag who has a very limited understanding of something you just got majorly upset over because someone called you out for being an entitled little cunt.

I paid for access and I'm enjoying it, but two things I'll say you should keep in mind. Firstly this is still an Alpha and there are plenty of bugs, things can and will change before launch so it's still quite flexible, and secondly there seem to be some key give aways going on lately so maybe you can just try and get one of those if you're reluctant to part with any cash.  That said you can buy the cheapest founder pack to get access and upgrade at any time if you decide you want to, the starting founder pack is pretty cheap."

I dont like having to deal with tank firing from behind bushes that I cant see because the spotting system in this game is as bad as World of Tanks. I dont really want to deal with bullshit ATGMs that can be fired from behind cover and are almost impossible to avoid unless you are next to hard cover yourself.  I want to sit down, drive my MBTs and kill tanks. And right now, PVE is going to give me just that experience while PVP is going to be the same sort of cluster fuck that WoT currently is and WoWs is turning into. The only reason Im currently tolerating WoT is because its the only tank game out there.  If Armored Warfare gives me a viable way to tier 8 vehicles without ever having to touch PVP ever again they will get all of my money."

ArmoredWarfare,3bug72,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:20:58 2015 UTC,"I've only done one PVE so far, but it was a lot fun. Very different feel from PVP, it really felt like a platoon of tanks rolling out on a mission and working together (Might of just had a good group, though). I can see where the challenge comes in even with the bots not being very bright; there are a lot of enemy tanks rolling around even on medium and they seem to throw in some surprises occasionally as I had to face an Abrams in my M60 on the first part. It was sort of like a mini boss. Definitely a nice change of pace.  Like others have said, it would be nice if the bots were a bit smarter. I'm also hoping theres some more variety in the mission types, as all the ones I saw boiled down to ""CAP!!!"" The secondary missions were honestly more interesting, and I kind of wish they were the main mission. On top of that, it wasn't terribly hard and we're going to need more challenging missions if Obsidian is expecting people to play PVE a lot. And of course the rewards are piddly currently.  Overall first impression is that PVE is very promising but it needs  a lot of work to make good on that.  EDIT: Ah, one more thing. Was the rewards screen screwed up for anyone else? The tables seemed completely wonky for me."

ArmoredWarfare,3br4in,THEUNITEDSTATESOFAME,5,Wed Jul 1 13:59:21 2015 UTC,I still dont understand why there is a +dmg bonus and not a +rof one.
ArmoredWarfare,3br4in,ItumTR,4,Wed Jul 1 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"While I think a RoF bonus would be a more realistic option, I get why they went with damage.  TDs have pretty weak armor. A RoF bonus would require more face time with the enemy, and thus expose the TDs to more enemy fire. A damage bonus lets them fire and reposition more effectively, which is the role they want TDs to fill, I think."
ArmoredWarfare,3br4in,TheScarlettHarlot,3,Wed Jul 1 15:00:29 2015 UTC,"A RoF bonus would require more face time with the enemy   That's a good point. It's also why I'm surprised people in WoT always get so caught up about DPS. WoT is an Alpha game 99% of the time, and AW is not really any different."
ArmoredWarfare,3br4in,Flaktrack,5,Wed Jul 1 16:12:02 2015 UTC,"This is why I will never stop my crusade to get an alpha buff for the Panther in WoT. It has some of the best DPM at it's tier but between thin armor, a midling HP pool, and the camo value of a small barn I didn't even need to get my damage ratio to 1.0 to get an MoE.  It's a tank that is tragically abused by the meta while being seemingly favored by mechanics."
ArmoredWarfare,3br4in,Yetanotherfurry,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:38:03 2015 UTC,Preaching to the choir for sure. I wanted to love the Panther so much but you could only really get the most out of it on certain maps. I have some good games in it but damn that tank was frustrating. Doesn't help that WG is hellbent on turning every map into a 3-lane MOBA clone with no ranged combat to stop the problems they created in the first place.
ArmoredWarfare,3br4in,Flaktrack,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:41:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah sometime after cries of ""Russian bias!!!1!"" finally petered out en masse it dawned on me that all the maps inherently favor peek-a-boom and brawling.

ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,MiG_Interceptor,2,Wed Jul 1 16:37:41 2015 UTC,"No, The conversion rate of Free XP AND Credits is where it should have been all along in WoT.  Wargaming have been ripping us off on their monopoly grip on this niche'.   Every calculation I ran concluded that WoT was at least x4 the price of admission of most AAA MMO's and ""Freemium"" games.  It was an obscene rip off - primarily due to tank fans happy to spend hundreds of dollars each year for artificially inflated demand.   Obsidian and My.com are being smart with their pricing because they are invading the market. If it works, you will see WoT enter into a price war for the first time in it's history, and similar ""generous"" offers will surface."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,OtterTenet,3,Thu Jul 2 00:31:59 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm not complaining, it's actually fair compared to WoT and WT."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,MiG_Interceptor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"Cheers!  Part of the reason I stopped playing WT was their pricing model, which was more greedy than WoT, with more blatant Pay2Win, and with none of the community or growth. The rude and ultimately stupid audacity of the attempt made me lose all interest in Gaijin except as a negative example for F2P theory."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,OtterTenet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:41:47 2015 UTC,"I hear that claim (Gaijin is more greedy than Wargaming) a lot, altho I so far cannot understand why. Premium time costs a fraction, premium tanks are way cheaper, no need to buy garages for each tank, no premium ammo.   I am not trolling you, mate. Wish I could understand where you are coming from. Can you explain your reasoning, please?"
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,The_Deester,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"They might have changed the prices from the time I was playing - this is what I experienced on release:   The Sherman premium tank on release, it would one-shot other tanks, was near invincible frontally, and had preferable MM.  The price was ~$35 as part of a pack, there was no way to get it separate.  Buying Crew XP with Premium currency, lots of premium currency. A fully upgraded crew was a huge, game winning, advantage. Perhaps much more in Airplanes than in Tanks, but it was a blatant P2W, and very expensive.    People spending thousands of dollars on one account of a recently released game is unhealthy.  That in itself is evidence of overpricing - there is no way that any company can create enough content of that value in a year (or two).   This means that anyone that actually wants to pay for the game is getting a bad deal on content. This means that abusing the free players is part of the content they are buying.   There is also this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/2e3gtd/this_has_to_end/cjw17cw?context=10000"
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,OtterTenet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"The german Sherman was part of a pack, in which you get premium time, some decals and some gold along with the tank. 35 € was quite a good deal at that time, especially if you wanted to gain access to the closed beta, which you got with the pack as well. There are tanks that you get for gold (the hardcash currency) alone. For those you will pay between 4 and 25 € depending on tier.  What you consider preferential MM is called the Battle Rating over here and it was wrong indeed. It got changed to the correct one after a few weeks. You were hard from the front, but not invincible. I was driving a german Sherman at that time and got blown up plenty from shots to the faceplate that fragmented down to the hull.   Premium tanks always get the same BR than their ""normal"" tree counterparts. Even if the premium is worse, because it might lack an MG. See the IS-2 for reference. Both same BR tho the premium has no 12mm. Very nasty disadvantage for a heavy especially.  Regarding the one-shot potential: Everyone can one shot everyone (within reason, at least in the same MM bracket). This system does not use total HP, but component HP. If I know, where to shoot you to ignite your ammo, I will one shot you if I hit where I aim. The bigger the caliber, the less aim needed. Sherman has a rather low caliber BTW. This is not special.  Upgraded crew is not such a big deal, especially for tanking in arcade mode. You gain xp over time quite fast anyway and the shell drop indicator with the red outline makes targeting super easy. Reload suffers tho. However other than in competitors, you use the same crew from tier 1 to tier 5 and keep training it without hardcash needed. It will be better over time. I think this is a big step towards customer friendlyness, because I am a hoarder. I had 60 garage slots in WoT, because I just can't let go of tanks I like. WT is perfect in that regard for me.  Hope I could give you another perspective, mate. I ain't trying to missioneer you, was just genuinely curious. Have a nice day! =)"
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,The_Deester,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:13:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the writeup.   Component HP seems a joke - it's just the same HP bars but entirely hidden from players so no one knows exactly how much damage each gun deals, allowing developers to arbitrarily mess up the numbers.  You get results like that video of a T-44 being unable to kill a Tiger from multiple hits to internals."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,OtterTenet,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:46:09 2015 UTC,"Do you actually play the game? Again, not trolling, just interested. It seems like you rely on secondhand knowledge a bit. You can get a good idea of how much damage your gun deals by checking the ""hit cam/death cam"" on the top right corner. You can see the shrapnel, how much, which angle, the grade of spray...all that will give you a very clear picture of the damage potential. Also for using different ammo on the same tank. APCR behaves way differently than APHE or HEAT. You can ""feel"" the differences.  I like the component system way more than a total hitpoint system. If I show you my juicy, soft side, you should be able to kill me if you understand the layout of my tank. In WoT and AW you can expect to get away with a move like this most of the times. I think that is stupid."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,The_Deester,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:57:27 2015 UTC,"So people ""feel"" that Tank A does less damage to modules than Tank B, even though that difference makes no sense in terms of ammo or gun characteristics or balancing. To me that's worse than having revealed HP bars. AW suffers from that to some extent, but at least it's highly visible and not hidden.   In WoT and AW people that show Juicy soft sides die fast enough already, but you don't have as many freak kills from the front. There is a lot less randomness in AW compared to both predecessors, IMO. (Even though the randomness in WT is mostly the due to damage model and ricochet quirks, not actual RNG)."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,OtterTenet,2,Fri Jul 3 14:32:02 2015 UTC,Sweet. month of premium is 200 gold cheaper than in WoT. I hope the gold prices have the same price as in WoT.

They get to sell gold, we get to spend gold, then we get to spend the same gold a second time for no added cost. How is that a money grab? I'd grab a load right now if that were the case. I'd test out all the premium tanks now. Then after the wipe and gold refund I'd buy the premium I liked the best."

ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,OtterTenet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:37:05 2015 UTC,It's still free if you choose. The only alternative is to just give everyone gold for free - which will ruin progression testing even more.
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,Highw4ySt4r,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:40:35 2015 UTC,"Not really - Obsidian have the power to grant Premium tank unlocks, then take them away.  They can do it at the end of a testing phase, and the extra credits earned will actually make the progression testing more realistic.   They recently had a double-credits event. Obviously credit inflation is not a concern."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,OtterTenet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:46:36 2015 UTC,"The x2 weekend would be easy to reset to a baseline by taking that data for that time and dividing by 2...so progression testing really wasn't affected much. Trying to reset some players spending gold on tanks vs premium account vs whatever to baseline would be a bit more of a challenge. Doable, but not as straightforward.   I do hope towards the end they unlock all tanks like the did in the alpha test."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,bspooky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:35:13 2015 UTC,"What gold spending? I never wrote anything like that, are you responding to your own points?  They can Unlock and Lock your tanks at will. No gold involved. No real harm to progression testing."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,OtterTenet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"The gold spending came in because I thought your ""not really"" was to highway's gold ruins progression point too... if you are only implying they could give premium tanks away for awhile my same point of it is easier to adjust metrics for a 2x weekend still applies. Cutting a weekend of 2x credit earnings in half for metrics is trivial. Programming the metrics to not report premium tank earnings may not be hard but would require testing, etc and may not be worth it.   Basically I don't see how a 2x weekend makes it obvious they don't care about credit inflation when those credit earnings are so easily normalized."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,bspooky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:23:36 2015 UTC,"If you assume that cutting a weekend of 2x credit earnings in half for metrics is trivial (which it's not if the credits are used) then you can also assume that the same cutting can be done for people who played X games in a Premium tank. Slightly longer database query perhaps, but nothing they can't do.   In any case this argument is pointless.  You agreed that they don't need to give players Gold to test Premium Tanks, which was exactly the argument I made to start this discussion. Cheers."
ArmoredWarfare,3brf3b,OtterTenet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:49:49 2015 UTC,"I agree once they have progression licked to their desires it'd be good to unlock stuff for testers....but until then using real world money to control the flow of testers into the game or testers having premium accounts/tanks seems reasonable. If they opened testing to everyone it would be open beta with a huge influx of testers they are likely not ready for. They could continue the beta test lottery, but many players who do not get in are upset. So the founder's packs made sense. Controlling how much gold is in the game seems reasonable too. On release, 100% of the population isn't going to have or buy gold. If they want a truer to life scenario and ability to test their cash shop...doing so in test would seem to be a good idea.   In other words, companies can do cash sales in testing w/o just being greedy.   I'll give you that true testers of products should likely be able to do so for free because they are providing a service. But how many of the people who have gotten into any beta for free are actually there to test the game and not just trying to get a leg up on the competition for release?"

ArmoredWarfare,3bq5pr,Pepsihawk,8,Wed Jul 1 06:39:46 2015 UTC,"Here is a list of similarities and differences from bspooky with some of my own edits.  Differences  -Modern armored vehicles from the 1950s on vs mainly experimental and world war 2 tanks.  -No modding (at least until they figure how to protect gameplay)  -More ammo variety (missiles, and not really any ""gold"" rounds in part because of the modern protection but also desire to keep P2W out of the game). AP ammo typically has lower dmg but higher pen while HEAT rounds have lower pen but higher dmg.  -Skill based matchmaking, the MM works the same way as WoT but will include an extra step of skill-based MM where after the players are selected it will distribute the players more evenly by some metric. How well this will work is still questionable.  -Tech tree is via arms dealer and not nation based as in WoT, this is meant to give greater flexibility in adding/rearranging new content.  -Artillery is faster firing, lower alpha, and limited to 2 (was 3 but unsure) per team. Artillery will almost never do top damage (don't think i've ever seen it) and have been relegated to a strictly support role. The devs have hinted at the future addition of SPG support ammo such as smoke and flare munitions.  -PVE (player vs environment, ie: cooperative play) content was added in EA3 (i'm sure you will read about it)  -Expands on the equipment concept in WoT, adding ERA and extra protection options. Supposedly there's a future retrofit system that allows one to further modify and customize the tank with stuff that wasn't ever implemented.  -Cryengine vs BigWorld yields better graphics but maybe at the expense of leaving older systems behind  -Gameplay is faster, there are no super slow tanks like the Maus. Even at lowest tier the vehicles are fast and nimble >50kph.  -American developer but Russian publisher. Non-Russian players will now have a voice with regards to development.  -5 classes of vehicles (MBT, Light Tank, AFV, TD, SPG), with MBTs as highest HP with armor and AFV with lowest hp and generally fastest.  -Crews stay with the vehicles but the commanders move around and offer special bonuses. Skill system is still being worked on but seems faster than WoT in current testing.  -Reduced RNG, meaning aiming and shooting on the move isn't mainly luck especially for AFV and Light tanks (they get a bonus to on the move accuracy).  Similarities  -Free to play  -Standard random battles between two teams of 15 players  -Progression system where the credits and experience (reputation) you earn in-game buys more tanks  -In-battle visual layout of minimap, aiming, consumables, modules and equipment is similar  -Controls are similar (WASD to move your tank, mouse to aim and shoot)  -Consumables look like the identical schema used in WoT.  -Spotting and camo system is very similar meaning with a little reduced learning curve you can transfer knowledge in WoT to AW quite nicely. Spotting is much more fluid, meaning they drop quicker and have less of a delay when playing vision control game."

You have to keep in mind that it's only in ""closed beta"". I'm not gonna be a fanboy and say it can only get better. Devs could fuck up something in the future. But from the looks of it, they're listening to their community!  I was invited into Alpha and I disliked how artillery worked, a majority of players shared my dislike, aaaaand they reworked artillery.  I'd say, that if you get the cheapest Founder Pack you'll get more than your money's worth."

I was like 2050WN8 in WoT (if you care) and things like artillery still annoyed me so much after the years. In AW it is far more balanced, ATGMs might be a little annyoing too but it's not that bad. After this sorted out it is pretty much WoT and I enjoy it, but I wouldn't pay for early access, they are giving it away in large numbers, just apply and wait, I was lucky enough to get to the second test and the game is improving and improving.  EDIT: By second test I mean that second weekend test quite some time ago, the first one was like 500 ppl only, so I have been in pretty much from the start and can say that it was rough back then, I had barely 30FPS on the lowest settings, now the game is running better than WoT, at least for me. So yeah, it's improving."

AW runs better, looks better, has nearly exactly the same mechanics, makes artillery better, has an incredible easy and painless grind. Low tier doesn't suck (honestly, I never drove stuff below T5 in WoT, it is the most painful thing to do)  and the devs LISTEN. It's WoT 2. Simple as that, sure, there are a lot of people that whine and say it is nothing like WoT, but these people are delusional.    It is rough around the edges right now, but hey: It's alpha/beta/early access whatever. The devs did more in a month than Wargaming in half a year.  This game will become very good in the following years."
ArmoredWarfare,3bq5pr,xTrewq,2,Wed Jul 1 13:45:51 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly the same, I can't remember if I have ever enjoyed WoT below tier 5, yet in AW I enjoyed all the tiers. Tier 3 Patton is really fun tank to drive for example."

If they add things like smoke and debuff shells it would me main artillery in Armored Warfare. Right now the only issue is the crappy amount of experience and creds you get when playing it.

ArmoredWarfare,3bq5pr,TheScarlettHarlot,2,Wed Jul 1 12:14:29 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry about it being too fast paced for you. I didn't really like most slow tanks in WoT so having mobile tanks in AW is appealing. I had an initial concern the game would play too much like a FPS that requires a lot of fast reflexes to play...but it is nowhere near that. Maybe a bit more fast paced than WoT but not all that much that you will seem out of place.
ArmoredWarfare,3bq5pr,Tang0Three,2,Wed Jul 1 12:15:32 2015 UTC,Been playing for two weeks. It was well worth the $15.  Tip for you: Don't do into this thinking you will use the same tactics as other tank games. It's much more mobile. Shooting on the move is a given in this game.
ArmoredWarfare,3bq5pr,Sisaroth,5,Wed Jul 1 17:54:25 2015 UTC,"AW is slightly faster, both in terms of the damage things deal and because modern armour is quicker than WW2 armour is/was.  There's a huge difference in movement speeds and agility at low tiers of course, because you're comparing the first creaking prototypes of what became proper tanks (WoT's tier 1 and 2) against 1960s APCs and light tanks (AW tier 1), but it evens out a bit later on. The biggest difference is in the damage everything does - even the lightest scout vehicles deal out a lot of damage, and in general the bigger heavier tanks do the least damage over time (even if they do quite a chunk per shot).  The design idea is that MBTs shouldn't really fear taking damage from the front, but AW isn't quite there yet - there are some armour bugfixes and penetration nerfs coming in the next EA cycle that address that, we'll have to wait and see if they work.  As an aside: It's only anecdotal evidence from one person, but I've played over 14,000 battles in WoT and I think AW is already approaching being a better game in its current state. It's buggy and poorly balanced in places, and the servers are only up for limited test periods, but I just find it more enjoyable overall. Artillery is integrated into the game much better, there's actually a reason to flank and swap ammo types, and there's no borderline-pay-to-win scumbaggery with camouflages and premium consumables/ammo. Unless they mess up something major, I'm not going back to WoT once this goes live. It sounds like you're wary of the servers not being up all the time (and on a related note probably wouldn't like bits of the game being unfinished), so I guess you'd probably be better off waiting for open beta - but I'd definitely recommend coming back to give AW a look when it's more finished and free if you don't decide to jump in now."
ArmoredWarfare,3bq5pr,InjuringThunder,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think you're right, waiting for the open beta might be a better idea. Maybe dayZ left me a bit jaded in that regard haha."
ArmoredWarfare,3bq5pr,Sisaroth,2,Wed Jul 1 10:37:57 2015 UTC,The game is not that much faster than WoT atm. MBTs are kinda like heavy tanks atm. Imo they are underpowered though so they might get buffs. Games are often stomps (more than WoT I feel) but I think that's because people still don't know how to play the maps.  But overall I like it a lot. If AW doesn't screw something up majorly then I'll probably never play WoT again.  Obsidian and mycom also seem better than WG on the ethical level. I feel bad giving money to WG with all the scummy things they did.
ArmoredWarfare,3bq5pr,pyrosity,2,Wed Jul 1 06:51:41 2015 UTC,"One question I had about mbts, do they actually have a use other than health sponge? Seems like the TDs would just demolish them"
ArmoredWarfare,3bq5pr,OtterTenet,2,Wed Jul 1 07:01:27 2015 UTC,"Well, there aren't actually that many TD's, and even the ones that are in game don't show up a great deal, because they have their own shortcomings, like a serious lake of protection. MBT's are not like the redundant Heavy tanks of WoT, a TD isn't just going to role around the corner and paste you with armour that you can't pen, or a gun you can't match. MBT's, I have found, tend to have scaled brawls to themselves at the moment, and woe betide anybody smaller that accidentally enters the fracas."

ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,Bluenosedcoop,9,Wed Jul 1 16:37:37 2015 UTC,"If higher tier MBTs could be frontally penetrated by tanks tiered lower than them, what would the point of the class be?  MBTs are essentially (pardon the WoT terminology) the heavy tanks of this game, and their armor and ability to duke it out in a head-on engagement are the only reasons to use MBTs.  The other classes have the advantages in mobility, spotting range, and some have more damage.  Now, I understand your point about lower tiered MBTs rendered helpless, but through using co-ordination and flanking them with a team-mate or two, they can easily be made a smoking wreck.  Just my opinion, I can't say I'm the most experienced player, but like I said, the main selling point of (most) MBTs is their armor, by nerfing that, they'll become useless."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,ejd37,12,Wed Jul 1 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"Dude, this has long been the problem with MBTs in the game - they WERE too weak frontally.  The fact that, for so long, autocannons could wreck an MBT frontally (that they still can do damage is stupid, I think).    See, the thing is... if an MBT isn't difficult/impossible to penetrate frontally, it literally has NO benefit.  TDs have higher alpha, lights and AFVs both get around faster and generally have higher DPM, just about every class has better accuracy.  The only thing MBTs have going for them is their armor and HP pools, and you want to eliminate that.  Use your mobility and flank them, seriously.  They don't have much in the way of side or rear armor, for the most part.  Stop trying to nerf tanks so that you don't have to work to do damage."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,Terrachova,6,Wed Jul 1 17:16:13 2015 UTC,Completely agree.  Sounds like OP isn't very imaginative with his tactics. MBTs are the anvil a force uses to smash the enemy against. They are supposed to be a solid wall that stops the enemy and makes them go elsewhere.  If you can't shoot it from the front find somewhere else to shoot it!
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,TheScarlettHarlot,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:51:47 2015 UTC,"Clearly most of you people have lost the inability to read where halfway through what i typed i make it pretty damn clear that i'm talking about Tier 7 MBTs versus Tier 8 MBTs.  As i stated halfway through that even as a T-80 against a Leopard 2A5 the front of the Leopard is impenetrable, This is nothing to do with tactics this has to with a preceding tier of MBTs being a fortress against the previous tier of MBTs.  I don't expect LTs or AFVs to be able to do anything extraordinary against the front of MBTs, But clearly i forgot about the inability for people to read through a whole post before replying."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,x7x_,-4,Wed Jul 1 19:06:25 2015 UTC,"The fact that you actually think autocannons were wrecking MBTs frontally tells me that you have no reasonable or logical thoughts on the matter to be heard.  There were no MBTs being wrecked frontally by any autocannons, Any extra damage done by autocannons in the front of MBTs was down to gaps in the modelling of MBT armour in places like the turret.  I've experienced what it's like as a T-80 coming up against a Leopard 2A5 and there is no frontal weakness for the T-80 to use against it, Your stupid comments would mean that as a Tier 7 slow MBT the T-80 should be using their crappy mobility to flank a tier 8 MBT and that is just plain stupid.  A tier 7 MBT should not be useless frontally against a tier 8 MBT else all balance is thrown out the window."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,Terrachova,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:02:24 2015 UTC,you used to be able to do 30-40 damage per shot with HE on autocannons FRONTALLY vs mbts.  their armor was underpowered/useless
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,Durandy,0,Thu Jul 2 02:14:06 2015 UTC,"This is an issue that's not specific to MBTs though - its another thing entirely.  The problem is the massive imbalances as you go up in tiers.  Each next tier is so much more capable than the last it's almost comical, save in a few limited cases.  That said, the next tier up SHOULD have the advantage.  Some balancing does need to be done I agree, but it shouldn't get to the point where a tier 7 MBT can go toe to toe with a tier 8 MBT."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,Highw4ySt4r,-4,Wed Jul 1 19:11:58 2015 UTC,"Sure they should have an advantage of more HP, better armour better gun etc. But the armour has crept up so massively over the space of 1 tier that it makes the previous tiers MBTs feel useless.  It shouldn't be completely useless frontally just because of 1 tier."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,Highw4ySt4r,2,Wed Jul 1 19:14:28 2015 UTC,The counter is HE and Arty forcing them to move out of a dug in position and exposing themselves or allowing the enemy MBTs to move up gaining ground.
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,OfensiveBias,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:42 2015 UTC,"It's funny, people complain in WoT that heavies are too weak frontally. Here people are complaining heavies are too strong frontally. If I'm going to bring a slow, big tank into a battle - I want to shrug off enemy shots."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,Ordengar_,-5,Wed Jul 1 18:17:51 2015 UTC,There's a difference between shrugging off shots and having such confidence in the armour that you can charge people head on with little to no consequence.  I'm not saying they should have no armour but there are no traditional frontal weaknesses for even 1 tier below MBTs (like a T-80 against a Leopard 2A5 there is not one frontal weakness for the T-80 to use).
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,Tang0Three,3,Wed Jul 1 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure there are, it's just early days and it takes time for people to find them. For example I discovered a weakspot on the M60A3, a view port that my autocannons can pen. Until then I just felt useless, like you feel now."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,UDownWithDPP,2,Wed Jul 1 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"I first read this post after you edited it, and I probably would have agreed with you if you didn't make your edit so insulting. If you wonder why you are getting downvoted, you should maybe consider your tone."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,UDownWithDPP,-4,Wed Jul 1 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"I don't care that i'm getting downvoted and i made my edit so that people would stop replying based on reading what they wanted, I had to make it very clear what i was talking because obviously putting it halfway through a paragraph is too much for some people."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,TheScarlettHarlot,2,Wed Jul 1 20:30:28 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way from a historical standpoint. Tier 7 tanks are what the Tier 8 designs were looking at when they were made(a very broad generalization but just bear with me.) So what you have is effectively a design made to specifically counter said previous designs. As the lower tier you should not try to go toe to toe with something specifically made to fight your tank. You cannot blame the tank you are in for the failings of your own tactics. You need to know your tank's limitations and what engagements you should be picking. Something I applaud AW  for doing is making armor mean something. in WoT look at tanks like the KV-4. Amazing machine but because of how the mechanics of the game are its biggest advantage, thick armor, is nearly useless. Having a tank with your one advantage being negated by spening some extra credits isn't fun. On the other hand you have AW, your tank is still mobile, you don't NEED to be going toe to toe with that higher tier MBT. There are other tanks you can get to or you can go and attempt to outmaneuver him and get some nice shots in."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,nuxes,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:41:27 2015 UTC,"For everyone that says you need to out maneuver and flank them, Not one person ever mentions the fact that the small design of the maps and the pretty bad spotting system DO NOT allow for this.  Yes in theory you can maneuver, change position or flank but not with the current design of the maps, Everything is either a bottleneck or wide open area ready to get spotted."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,x7x_,2,Thu Jul 2 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"The response to this, in a matching condescending and offensive tone, would be:  Stop fighting higher tier MBTs from the front, you moron. You are not supposed to be able to fight them that way. You're the paper, they're the scissors. The counter to your big tough block of metal is a bigger, tougher block of metal. You SHOULD feel useless fighting them like that. They are the linebreakers, the anti-camping stalemate busters.  Now if we're going to be a bit more civilised about things, you have to take a more thoughtful approach. T-90 rolling up on your poor outmatched T-80? Blow his tracks off, take cover and get some help. Artillery love tacked tanks. Challenger pushing through the guys on your right? Drive over there and flank him for them. He can't push forward if there's anyone to his flank, or he'll take a hit in the engine.  The top tier MBT is the Ubercharge of AW, if you'll forgive the TF2 metaphor. It serves to break stalemates and prevent fights stagnating by allowing a forward push, and it's not countered by standing and shooting at it. There are counters, but bouncing shells of their glacis is not it.  MBTs that aren't top tier in a particular fight can still block and bully though most things on the enemy team, and because they're modern tanks and not lumbering WW2 super-heavies they can still flank and retreat when outmatched. This armour tiering system is one of the things that will help stop AW devolving into a scouts-and-snipers campfest where heavy vehicles don't have a role."
ArmoredWarfare,3brp47,x7x_,-4,Wed Jul 1 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"There was no condescending tone until most of the initial people responding decided not to read even half of what i put and decided i was talking about AFVs fighting MBTs head on, The condescending tone was needed as it was clear that many people were having a hard time reading 3 or 4 paragraphs properly.  And for your comment as to asking what i'm doing fighting Tier 8s  head on, The maps don't allow you to adjust tactics they are neither open or big enough to decide to run away whenever a 1 tier higher, You come across a higher tier and you most of the time have no option but to do what you can and fight it, That tank being 1 tier higher does NOT mean that it should be completely invulnerable to any fire from a 1 tier lower MBT.  It will not lead to a very engaging or enjoyable game if every match involves having to run away from MBTs whose armour has crept up higher than what balance should allow.  The ultimate fun killer and therefore playerbase and profitability killer for any player especially in games like this is to feel like you are useless, This is after all let's not forget an arcade influenced game and should not be trying to mimic a simulation of real life it does not lend itself to balance or fairness."
ArmoredWarfare,3bmj5v,bspooky,6,Tue Jun 30 12:41:56 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression this was single player, dont know why I didn't think it was co-op. Either sounds like what you'd expect. Maps with objectives, time limit, and 5 man team. Could be fun."
ArmoredWarfare,3bmj5v,PhilosophizingCowboy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"If they have some AI, that would make it (I would think) relatively easy to make a single-player mode."
ArmoredWarfare,3bmj5v,Protuhj,2,Tue Jun 30 20:31:19 2015 UTC,"Here's the official translation from the EU/NA forum:  In Early Access 3, apart from the standard PvP mode, second option will be added – a Player versus Environment mode in which teams of 4 or 5 players will be able to fight AI-controlled opponents in series of battles. These battles will be a part of the new Mission system where players will be able to accept contracts with certain story background. Each contract consists of three missions bound together by a background story, taking place all over the world. Each contract is available for a certain period of time, during which the players can complete the contract missions, learn new tactics and receive rewards.  The main feature of the Mission system is the team coordination requirement – the success of each mission depends on the cooperation of all the players together in battle. Unlike the PvP mode, in PvE every player has to understand his part and role in battle – without cooperation the team cannot succeed. Both the game chat and the quick commands can be used to communicate effectively while coordinating the team efforts.  Entering the battle  Starting a PvE battle works the same way as starting a PvP battle does. First the player has to select a vehicle from those available in the garage and then click on the Mission button. It is also possible to enter the PvE queue in a platoon of up to 5 players.  The majority of the missions require the teams to consist of various classes. The more complicated the mission, the more important this requirement is. There is also one restriction that is active for all the missions: there cannot be more than one artillery vehicle per team.  Difficulty levels  There are three difficulty levels of each mission:  Recruit – for new players, serves as the entry level to the game in order for players to get used to the tactics and the flow of battle Warrior – standard difficult, more difficult but perfectly suitable for a player with some experience already Veteran – high difficulty level suitable only for experienced players and players specializing on PvE  In the future, a fourth difficulty level will be added – the “Insane”, only for the most skilled of players. The mission will remain the same objective-wise but some of the parameters will change: the number of opponents and their vehicle tiers, time limits etc. For each map you can select the difficulty level individually. Map sets are changed every day.  Combat missions  During the missions the players will be confronted by AI-controlled enemies (also known as “bots”). Their numbers and quality are defined by the difficulty level of the mission. Many opponents have suffixes to their name, showing their quality and differences from the “standard” vehicles and telling players how difficult that respective opponent is. These suffixes are:  (Rookie) The least effective vehicle (Damaged) Weaker than the standard vehicle (without suffix) Standard vehicle (Modified) Somewhat more powerful vehicle (Elite) The most dangerous variant of vehicle  For successful completion of the objectives, players are rewarded with reputation points and credits. Players will receive a smaller reward even if the mission was not successful. There are three types of objectives:  Primary (main) Secondary Individual (additional challenge)  The primary objectives are given to the entire team and the mission cannot be successfully ended without completing them. Secondary objectives are given to the entire team as well but completing them only influences the size of the reward the players get. The team gets bonuses for completing the secondary objectives but they are also time-limited and therefore more difficult. Individual objectives are given to each player separately. They depend on the class and vehicle the player is using and completing them is entirely optional. If completed however, the mission reward is increased even further for that respective player.  There are numerous types of objectives in the game, including the defense of certain area, the destruction of enemies of the capture of certain objects.  All the objectives are displayed on the minimap as well as on the player screen.  Battle mechanics  All the vehicles in PvE battles work the same way as in PvP. If player’s vehicle is destroyed in PvE mission, the player has to repair it the same way also. On the other hand, if the player dies while completing a contract in one mission, he can join the battle during the next mission of the contract. This respawn happens automatically at the start of each contract phase, there is no need to leave the battle."

Just comments made by people coming into chat etc. Circon seemed to have a bigger amount of WoT players in his chat, since that's what his streams the most. He has talked about losing subs just because he was streaming AW (people saying in chat to him that was the reason) and him having to defend his choice of game. People in chat saying trolly shit, noticed a few people getting banned from his chat.   Saying all that I'm new to watching Circon so I don't know if its always like that, but SideStrafe's chat is usually chill place so I noticed the comments more. Both of them seem pretty good at controlling their chat so I never gets out of control."
ArmoredWarfare,3bir3h,Sisaroth,0,Tue Jun 30 00:22:56 2015 UTC,Circon has a lot of less viewers when he streams AW compaired to WoT. He also got a lot of messages saying they would unsub if he would continue streaming AW.

The main feature of the AMV is its modular design, which allows the incorporation of different turrets, weapons, sensors, or communications systems on the same carriage. Designs exist for different APC vehicles (armoured personnel carrier) and IFV versions (infantry fighting vehicle), communications versions, ambulances and different fire support versions, armed with large caliber mortar and gun systems. The vehicle has a very good level of mine protection and can withstand explosions of up to 10 kilograms (22 lb) TNT. The AMV has protection levels up to 30 mm APFSDS frontal arc. Another important feature is the very good mobility (combining speed, agility, and crew comfort) in rough terrain, enabled by the sophisticated but rugged hydraulic suspension adjusting each wheel individually.

ArmoredWarfare,3bhb47,YourImag1nat1on,4,Mon Jun 29 05:35:42 2015 UTC,"Obsidian stated they were only going to do tanks that were working/built, The Black Eagle is in a bit of a grey area there in that as far as the public is concerned no-one has ever seen a working Black Eagle (there was a prototype shown in 1999 but its debatable whether that was working or not because they obscured most of the tank with camo netting).  With a Russian head of research stating in reference to the prototype shown in 1999 ""and those 20-year-old pictures show a mock-up of a futuristic tank which remained just a product of someone's imagination""  I think if Obsidian are sticking to their idea of not having ""on paper"" tanks then the Black Eagle won't be added to the game."
ArmoredWarfare,3bhb47,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:08:29 2015 UTC,"This won't work as a premium tank as tier 6 is the current top end for premium tanks. The reason tier 6 is the top for premium tanks is pay-to-win and balance.  T8 is the current top conventional tier in the game, and we really don't know how t9 and t10 are going to be handled regarding pub matches/pve and competitive play. All we know is that they will not be part of the dealer system. Considering this lack of knowledge, and the devs not saying when it will be released other than ""soon"", I'm going to say that t9 and t10 are currently a non-factor.  In addition, the purpose of premium tanks is to allow people to buy a tank that earns extra credits and experience. Preferably that vehicle would have a unique and interesting  playstyle and be more fun than average, but these are not really requirements. The other idea behind premium vehicles is the only unlock requirement is money. Obsidian is trying very hard to avoid pay-to-win, so premium vehicles are intentionally designed to slightly underperform for their tier.   so the problem comes down to this: If Obsidian ever made a t8 premium, they would not implement a system that prevents new players from buying it as My.com would never let them. So that leaves us with a t8 that is definitely pay-to-win for progression as with 4 low payments of 19.99 you can have an end-tier vehicle. no matter how balanced the vehicle is, it becomes a massive balance hot-potato, because even if it is balanced perfectly, someone will always be whining about it and if obsidian ever touches it, it spawns a massive shitstorm because ""I payed for that tank so they can't change it"".  top tier premiums are a no-win situation for obsidian. The whole point of premiums is to make money and experience, and you don't need to be top tier to do that."
ArmoredWarfare,3bhb47,OfensiveBias,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"Main reason i suggested this is because i have played alot of the T-100 Varsuk in Arma 3, the 125mm gun would be cool to see in AW."

ArmoredWarfare,3bhb47,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:29:19 2015 UTC,It would be Tier 8 minimum. I don't think there will be Tier 9/10 premium tanks so this might not make it if it's better placed in Tier 9.

ArmoredWarfare,3bhb47,VoteRonaldRayGun,-2,Mon Jun 29 07:31:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think up to tier 8 is fine so long as there's a prerequisite to own a normal tank of the same tier. They probably will add tier 7-8 eventually.  If the devs limit to Tier 6 that would be fine. Just it may doom this tank from ever getting a place."

I know it'll be nerfed in some what that will just ruin it and then I'll be really sad.   Like they can nerf the pen by about 10% or drop 100 damage off the alpha and it'd still be wonderful fun, just don't nerf the mobility and I'd be thrilled.   edit: spells"
ArmoredWarfare,3bhlpo,HandBanaba,0,Mon Jun 29 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"Need to nerf: Alpha or RoF Camo and View Range  I think mobility can stay the same. The problem is that the LAV-300 can outspot most AFVs and even the LAV-600. When it does spot them, the camo is so great that it can shoot without fear of return fire."
ArmoredWarfare,3bhlpo,HandBanaba,2,Mon Jun 29 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"It's odd to me that the B1 Cent has much worse camo than the LAV-300 for sure.  I think it's view range should be about 20M longer than MBTs at most but camo should probably stay the same or it fails in it's primary field of being stealthy. I don't really play mine as a stealthy sniper much, seems like I do a lot of run and gun sort of play with it, my average damage in it per game is around 2800 though. my leo 1 only got to 2100~ damage before I earned the creds to buy it and I've played roughly the same number of games between the two so it's definitely a bit too strong right now, and the leo is a bit weak if I'm to be honest."
ArmoredWarfare,3bhlpo,HandBanaba,-1,Mon Jun 29 17:47:25 2015 UTC,"I'd be fine with just a view range nerf. I don't like getting out spotted by the same class of vehicle I'm in that's two tiers below me.  I don't think the Leopard 1 is weak, I had a blast in mine. It has the health pool to be risky, I've found. I managed a 76% winrate in it because the amount of health and RoF combined allowed me to outplay every other MBT."

I say it feels weaker but my own play in it proves its far from underpowered.    From the outside the Leo 1 is the one tank I see get punished the hardest for poor decisions.  It's really just a tank with a higher skill floor than the T-64 and the less skilled players get severely punished. I personally hated it for the first 10 games then figured out I was playing it wrong and it instantly became my favorite mbt. I played up to the t-72 on the other tree and didn't like those nearly as much as the Leo 1  Yeah, the LAV-300 view range is really out of place. But like the swingfire, it'll get fixed I'm sure."

ArmoredWarfare,3bha8n,Terrachova,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:49:55 2015 UTC,"If you'll permit me an opinion, it's starting to feel like the biggest thing that needs to happen is balancing - specifically, high tier balancing.  The mid tiers (with the exception of the Sheridan) are fairly well balanced, and that's because there's been a ton of play at those tiers.  Upper tiers though... we're seeing now the issues, but it could be even more apparent if we got some more regular playtime with them.  Few people have the time to grind out more than a single tier 7 in preparation for 8s.  My suggestion, if it hasn't already be considered: unlock everything, or do it in blocks, to get maximum exposure.  If you ask me, the progression is largely okay aside from the wierd 'fasttracking' things in cases where skipping a tier due to the tree means you pay tier 5 costs for a tier 6.  Plus, balance is far more important for the game than progression balance - people won't stick around if the game is unbalanced, but they can tolerate a bit of a grind if it's balanced.  Anyway, you guys have probably already thought of all this, just figured I'd throw my voice out there.  Loving what I've seen and the potential - just gotta nail down some of the issues!"
ArmoredWarfare,3bha8n,my_freitag,2,Mon Jun 29 13:25:31 2015 UTC,"Well there's two issues here:   High tier balancing. EA2 is the first time the vast majority of players have gotten their hands on Tier 6-7 vehicles. EA3 will be the same for Tier 8's. Expect to see balancing as a result of this test. Unlocking everything is great ... once we've tuned progression. This extended test was a great data source for progression, and hopefully now we're in a good place to focus a lot more on tuning of vehicles (like premiums)."
ArmoredWarfare,3bha8n,rteague2566,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:44:57 2015 UTC,Forgive me for piggybacking onto this comment. But is there a master list of expected features being implemented into the game? Like a Development map or something similar? I've been looking for one for several days and aside from bits and pieces from Developer Diaries and interviews I can't find anything solid.
ArmoredWarfare,3bha8n,my_freitag,2,Mon Jun 29 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"Obviously we have that kind of thing internally, but we don't have any plans for it externally at the moment. I'm interested to hear your thoughts for and against such a system. To be honest, I'm a bit wary of it, because it's difficult to message that the features are not guaranteed.  An example of this that I've seen is Planetside 2, which has a development roadmap that's difficult to maintain, and also tends to cause more problems (for developers and players) than it solves.  Anyway let me know your thoughts, and it's definitely something we can talk about more, internally and externally."

I would be interested to see what you're aiming for (like a feature list) but I fully understand keeping those internal because somethings are found out to be impossible due to budget/time constraints and other priorities.

I would also argue that very light vehicles should have less resistance to HE."
ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,nuxes,2,Sun Jun 28 19:33:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think nerfing autocannons is the best solution to the problem.  AFVs are currently over-buffed compared to their IRL counterparts because otherwise they would not meaningfully contribute to the game. having autocannons with high pen allows enterprising AFV drivers to actually do damage and contribute to the match.   My proposal would simply allow MBTs to fight back. Nerfing autocannons just hurts AFVs, but adding canister rounds only hurts dumb AFV drivers as the smart ones approach from where the MBT driver does not expect. It also gives MBT drivers the feeling that they actually have an offensive ability against AFVs.  but we will see if EA3 addresses this problem in a satisfactory manner."

ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,Stromovik,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:32:10 2015 UTC,Which autocannons could actually pen the front of an MBT with AP rounds? This discussion is not about autocannon HE and it never was.
ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,nuxes,0,Mon Jun 29 01:10:47 2015 UTC,Depends on which MBT. On Leopard 1 and T-62 the frontal plate would degrade after 5-6 rounds.
ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,Ketadine,3,Mon Jun 29 10:59:09 2015 UTC,This discussion is also not about real life.
ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,TheScarlettHarlot,0,Mon Jun 29 12:58:10 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, they aren't nerfing the stats of the autocannons, they are buffing the side armor of MBTs. Autocannons will still be just as effective again light armor."
ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,Ketadine,3,Sun Jun 28 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"Penetration for autocannons above 20mm has been reduced by about 15% (20mm autocannon penetration is unaffected)   nope, they are nerfing pen according to SS's patch notes."
ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,TheScarlettHarlot,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why they nerfed them, imo they were not that effective to begin with unless you shot MBTs in the back."
ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,Ketadine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:49:55 2015 UTC,"Some lower-level MBTs (looking at you, Leopard 1) have pretty thin armor that autocannon go right through.  Theoretically, those tanks are supposed to make up for light armor with high pen, high RoF guns, but it just doesn't work like that in practice against rapid fire autocannon.  It sucks a bit, because how do you balance for just a few very weak tanks?"
ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,TheScarlettHarlot,3,Mon Jun 29 11:39:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's I think the only MBT that is vulnerable to those rounds, the rest are more or less immune.  And the Leo has a higher RoF compared to the other MBTs, but I think it needs a accuracy buff or view range or a higher camp rating or a pen buff :-)"
ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,Bluenosedcoop,2,Mon Jun 29 12:02:09 2015 UTC,"I picked the Leo because it has lower armor all around. In my experience, most of the lower tier MBTs can be penned with ACs by flanking shots.  As a new Leo driver, I agree it does need a little bit of a boost. Not too much, but some. If played right, it can still be very effective, but not all maps lend to the long range style it needs right now."
ArmoredWarfare,3bf6ug,VoteRonaldRayGun,2,Mon Jun 29 12:09:22 2015 UTC,"I actually like the Leo mostly due to the higher mobility it has, but I feel you're handicapping yourself when playing."

ArmoredWarfare,3bf8du,TheScarlettHarlot,3,Sun Jun 28 18:14:25 2015 UTC,API ammo is great for starting engine fires. It has much higher penetration than HE and can still start fires. Get behind an MBT and you can turn him into a Zippo.

Try and flank because autocannons won't do shit to them frontally. IF that opportunity doesn't present itself, then I just shadow my teams highest tier MBT. Wait for the enemy to fire at them first, then rush in and circle them to death. Make sure the enemy won't reload before you can get around them before you attempt a rush."
ArmoredWarfare,3bf8du,Highw4ySt4r,2,Sun Jun 28 18:50:54 2015 UTC,"As all scouts, don't engage directly, try to flank. Use incendiary rounds against MBTs and regular AP against all other. I would suggest you get module damage for the secondary crew as your accuracy is ok, even on the move and given the 45 round mag and fast reload, your better of than the other options imo.  Lastly, don't over commit, it's easy due to the speed and don't shoot unless you know you'll get a kill or a tracking shot. Also don't forget to designate targets."
ArmoredWarfare,3bf8du,Ketadine,2,Mon Jun 29 09:41:37 2015 UTC,"Pick on LAV150s, you can usually one clip them. Ignore MBTs unless you can get behind them or they are real low on health."

ArmoredWarfare,3bcpf8,Jbobakanoosh,6,Sat Jun 27 23:42:48 2015 UTC,"APFSDS is a kinetic penetrator, so imagine it as it is. A very long arrow that is fired out of a tank. This type of round will go through tracks, spaced armor(if it can penn that thickness obviously), fuel tanks, etc etc. It's your standard round and the most reliable due to its shell velocity and tendency to go through external modules.   HEAT rounds are useful if you totally understand how they work. Think of HEAT rounds as giant cylinders that when in contact with armor shoots a laser beam of superheated shit through said armor, hence doing damage. This superheated shit however CANNOT go through many external modules. If you hit tracks it will prematurely detonate the fuse and the shaped charge will diffuse in the space between the tracks and armor.   This means that tanks or weakpoints with usually 50 75% less armor than your stated penetration with HEAT will suffer from it. If you're a T62 driver than you should use HEAT vs tanks like the leopard 1 who have only 60-70mm raw thickness on the armor. It will in turn mean more damage. AP is in the middle of the spectrum with HE being the lowest damage, and HEAT and shaped charges doing the most. Remember as well that ATGM's act exactly like HEAT. There are multiple pieces of equipment tanks use to diffuse HEAT and ATGM's.   Tanks with ""ERA"" Kits use explosive panels to deter shaped charges, do NOT shoot a shaped charge round at any square looking blocks at a tank that used ERA, hell if a tank can USE ERA just fire AP at it to be safe. HEAT has the sas effect of having a slower travel time clocked at 750m/s compared to AP's 1200 and HVAP's 1500.   High explosive frag and HESH are totally different types of shell. HE-Frag is like a massive hand grenade that does X amount of damage if it penns and X amount of damage if it doesn't penn. I tend to stay away from HE because there have almost never been a situation where I'd said to myself gee I wish I had Frag over My HEAT Or AP. What I will admit however is HE-Frag and HESH eat modules for breakfast. If you detonate any HE rounds in the fighting compartment or turret you're batting for a crew kill. As for HESH, good god.  The British tanks use HESH in AW, and it's pretty funny. I never really use it, it's more of a pestering round than anything. It has incredibly low penetration. Like JESUS If I hit a crow with this 120mm HESH Round it wouldn't go in. Only Shoot AFV's and the rear of LT's with this. It's purpose is not to do damage either, but completely destroy modules, and boy does it do that. If you Come up against a tank that you can't pen just wait for backup and throw some HESH shells at him. In a chief mk5 I hit a T80s turret ring, jammed his turret ring, nuked his view ports, ammo racked him twice, knocked both tracks off, and lit him on fire. This things results can vary wildly, usually not for the better."
ArmoredWarfare,3bcpf8,TheAylius,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:05:59 2015 UTC,"Nice description, but I would recommend using HE when the target is on low health. I use it regularly when an MBT has a few hundred HP left."
ArmoredWarfare,3bcpf8,Ketadine,2,Mon Jun 29 10:33:10 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion and unofficial testing, I've found HE to be pretty much useless on anything that isn't an Auto-Loader, but it's the only way to damage some MBTs of the higher tiers. AP is pretty much for everything, you can use it on just about everything if you know where to shoot. HEAT is like you said, good for anything lower tier than you, but, like your teammates said, it is also effective against Leo 1's because the Leo 1 has abysmal armor. It can be penned by just about anything it comes across. I'm pretty sure I got pinned by an M113 in a recent match.  So yeah TL/DR: AP for everything, HE for when playing auto-loader/shooting something you can't pen with AP/HEAT, HEAT for anything lower tier than you/Leo 1s."

AP rounds are for use against targets with especially tough armour, or countermeasures that will stop HEAT rounds (cage armour, spaced armour, reactive armour and active protection systems - generally found on MBTs from mid-tier onwards). HE rounds are for things you can't penetrate at all, even with AP, or for hitting light targets if you don't have HEAT rounds.  AP is reliable damage, HEAT is more damaging but potentially counterable."
ArmoredWarfare,3bcpf8,Terrachova,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"Duly noted, thanks for the input!"
ArmoredWarfare,3bcpf8,leobyt,0,Sun Jun 28 00:03:21 2015 UTC,"Basically... HEAT is higher damage, lower pen.  Use it for all targets save the front of MBTs that might be iffy to pen."
ArmoredWarfare,3bcpf8,x7x_,2,Sun Jun 28 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"I usually  carry 50% AP, 30% HEAT and 20% HE.  AP is a good against everything, will pen most of the enemy tanks in their weak spots and deal some good damage. It's good against heavily armored targets or long range shots, since usually it has an high muzzle velocity ( 1k or more m/s ).   HEAT has lower pen and muzzle velocity, but it deals more damage. Perfect against lightly armored targets. When the enemy has ERA ( explosive reactive armor ) the shell will have no effect; in this case go for AP rounds . Around tier 5 tanks start mounting ERA armor.  The muzzle velocity is not that high ( around 750 m/s ). For example as a TD i load HEAT when a scout or another TD is trying to rush me.  HE is good for things you can't pen. It will deal a small amount of damage but it will destroy the modules of the enemy tank. If it penetrates it might deal full damage but it's quite a rare occurrence. The speed of the shell is rather low ( 500 m/s ) so you will have to lead your aim. I'm not using HE lately since using the LAV-600 AP ammo you can pen almost everything. HE is really useful for tracking tough MBTs: first round and you block them, second round and you knock out their turret ring and the rest of the rounds are going to slowly drain their HP pool while your mates shoot at them as well. Never underestimate HE and always carry some with you.  Your team mates where talking about HEAT on the Leo 1 because it's an MBT with really light armor. Both AP and HEAT will pen it from the front, but HEAT will deal more damage, making it more efficient."
ArmoredWarfare,3bcpf8,bspooky,2,Sun Jun 28 00:11:11 2015 UTC,"Heat: Use on soft targets, or the sides/rear of heavy ones where you can penetrate. Has highest alpha, so obviously first choice.  AP/APFSDS: Use on Heavy targets HEAT won't penetrate due to composite/ERA armor. Lowest alpha.  HE: Use on anything the above doesn't work for. Any damage is better than none... And it's saved my ass quite a few times vs more heavily armored targets.  HESH/HEP: Use instead of HE in all cases if it is available. Better module damage."
ArmoredWarfare,3bcpf8,DJSpacedude,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:11:41 2015 UTC,On the LAV-300 the final gun has both HESH and HEP (along with ap and he of course) so picking between hesh and hep is somehthing I am not clear on.
ArmoredWarfare,3bcpf8,x7x_,2,Sun Jun 28 05:07:33 2015 UTC,IIRC HESH and HEP are the exact same thing. Just pick the one with better stats.
ArmoredWarfare,3bcpf8,Instincthr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:54:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not 100% sure which one to use either. I think HESH does more module damage and HEP is more regular damage, but I'm not sure on the mechanics."

ArmoredWarfare,3bceh9,wdrpdr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:59:29 2015 UTC,"Burst damage. Three shells in 6 seconds is a lot of damage, especially once you've got fully upgraded ammo.  Also, the Palmaria only does ~70 less damage per shell elited."

ArmoredWarfare,3bceh9,MinorityShack,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:40:10 2015 UTC,"The aim time between shots is (just) manageable with the right crew and commander skills. You do have to get good at leading targets to hit people trying to dodge, but to be honest that's necessary for all SPGs."

ArmoredWarfare,3b9rvd,HandBanaba,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:26:04 2015 UTC,Hope it works out. So long as the premium tanks are balanced but not over-nerfed like the premiums in WoT. Most premium tanks in WoT aren't worth buying at all these days.

Even now at almost 2PM CST there is only ~530 players online.   Obviously this will get better with open beta but as it stands right now, I just wish there were more people playing when I'm able to play.   It was kind of a hope of mine that this game would be huge and have a massive Early access group. But as it stands right now not a lot of folks want to grind because they are unaware that progress won't be wiped for EA3 or simply don't want to play when it isn't for real, which I understand. Thats the only reason I don't have a tier 7 already is because I didn't want to grind it out thinking EA3 was gonna just wipe it. While we know the progress wipe isn't happening for EA3 now it's not been officially posted (I haven't looked at the news yet today) on any of the official resources like the launcher.   All that being said, I'm a huge AW fan and I want it to succeed in a big way! I hope others will see it like I do and realize it's a fantastic  game already and is only going to get better!"

ArmoredWarfare,3b9se6,Sublimexe,11,Sat Jun 27 03:48:44 2015 UTC,"Hey Sublimexe! I'm Freitag, Community Manager for Armored Warfare, and I thought maybe I could answer some of your questions.  We're still pretty early in development. We had some invite-only closed alpha rounds in the last 3 months, and then about a month ago we started having our first Early Access tests. We expect to go into Open Beta later this year, but we're not as close to that point as Skyforge is.   If you're looking for a finished product, then Armored Warfare probably isn't there for you just yet. We're still early enough in our closed testing that we can still make some pretty major changes to the game based on player feedback (if you take a look at what we did with Artillery, you'll get a sense for what I mean), but as you pointed out, a lot of stuff isn't that polished yet. We're trying to get the core aspects of the game settled before we focus too much on prettying things up.  If you're on the fence, I'm happy to send you an Early Access code so you can check out the game before making any kind of decision. You could also purchase the $15 Soldier of Fortune bundle, which gives some currency and premium time when the Open Beta starts, and will give you Early Access right away (you can always upgrade later on), but an Early Access code would be the most painless way for you to test the waters.  Let me know!"
ArmoredWarfare,3b9se6,my_freitag,3,Sat Jun 27 03:59:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the awesome reply! I did purchase the 15$ bundle to try out the game and I'm really looking forward seeing how will this game would shape up, till then I'll hold off upgrading for the 70$ pack. I'm planning to play both skyforge and armored warfare when they are released, I already purchased the 70$ founders pack in skyforge I just wish skyforge have a CM as awesome as you guys have here."
ArmoredWarfare,3b9se6,my_freitag,4,Sat Jun 27 04:15:00 2015 UTC,"Great! And don't worry, the Community Manager for Skyforge is much more awesome than I am, so you're set there.  If you have any thoughts on Armored Warfare, feel free to ping me anytime."
ArmoredWarfare,3b9se6,rteague2566,2,Sat Jun 27 04:23:23 2015 UTC,"The Community Manager already came in here and filled you in about the state of the game, but I'm curious as to why you think the UI is plain? Compared to other similar games I feel as though its polished, sleek, and uses whats called ""Flat Design"" very effectively."
ArmoredWarfare,3b9se6,Tombot3000,2,Sat Jun 27 05:21:22 2015 UTC,"I think the overall design is very simple, it gets the job done? I guess so but its not something that I would expect off a modern tank game that is made in 2015. For example the wrench and spray paint icon looks so simple I think I could have made a better, more detailed version in paint in less than a minute. Another one would be lack of tool tips, right off the bat I can see 4 currency, when I mouseover this currency, I dont see any tool tip explaining what are these currency used for or what not. I'm sure theres plenty more stuff they can improve regarding UI and optimization."
ArmoredWarfare,3b9se6,EternalFury,4,Sat Jun 27 05:37:21 2015 UTC,"You're right that they could have more tooltips ,but I actually prefer the clear, simple symbols they use for things like the wrench icon. It's immediately apparent what things are and they are visually distinct."

ArmoredWarfare,3ba6bx,VoteRonaldRayGun,9,Sat Jun 27 06:35:43 2015 UTC,"The people comparing missiles to artillery are fucking idiots. I stated why in another thread but I guess I'll do it again here. Let me state what's similar between missiles and arty. They aren't AP/HEAT rounds, and they both give a warning. That's the end of the similarities. Missiles have to have direct LOS now with the change. Modules rape missiles. Tracks rape missiles. Terrain rapes missiles. Every single time you were hit by a missile, you could've been hit by AP/HEAT. Except you would not have had a warning. Missiles are literally the worst offensive system in the game, and yet one of the most hated. It's hilarious. You got ammo racked if you took 900 damage. Which is possible with every other type of ordinance as well."
ArmoredWarfare,3ba6bx,atriax,0,Sat Jun 27 16:12:44 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't with missiles, its with the Swingfire.

I never got hit with atgm unless I was out of position and have no fallback position in mind. If I got killed with atgm I didn't get mad at all; I mean it's much harder to hit than those straight (near enough) shooting 1200 m/s traveling shells.

If arty is aiming at you, you will be notified, doesn't matter if you play arty yourself or not, the game will tell you, 6th sense is a default ""skill"" you have it from the first match. Apart from your crew you also get a commander that has his own skills, the commander is the same on all tanks, you have it everywhere, you don't have to farm the shit out of him like you do with normal crew. When  playing arty, enemy arty are shown on the minimap from time to time to make counter arty better and arty less op. Some tanks have skills of they're own, there a light tank with very high pen that has smoke grenades so he can make himself harder to hit to enemies, also it has mouse guided missiles so there's also that, lol."

Also at first I was put off by the lack of nation trees but now thinking about it I like it a lot more, it allows us to get amazing tanks like the Israeli Merkava without needing to fabricate an entire line for their country.

ArmoredWarfare,3b2njb,Tarnsman4Life,2,Thu Jun 25 23:36:21 2015 UTC,"The point of the Leo in real life was to ditch armor and free the leo to be as fast and maneuverable as possible. HEAT rounds were just starting to come of age, and they had far more penetration than tanks had armor, so it was decided to put a very large gun, the L7a3 onto a chassis that would be able to hit first.  The leo in game accurately reflects what the leo was designed to do. It has no armor, but that is intentional. The gun handling is also markedly better than most other MBTs of its tier, which reflects the trade-offs in its design.  If it was moved down, the armor would be more relevant, but that was never the point of the Leo, and it would actually remove what make the Leo unique."
ArmoredWarfare,3b2njb,OfensiveBias,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:59:33 2015 UTC,"This is very true. The Leo 1 was a strange tank and does reflect at all the design philosophy of other MBTs of the time.

(Steps: Turn off AntiVirus, or it's download protection -> Re-Download launcher from aw.my.com -> Shut down My.com launcher, make sure it's fully down from Task Manager -> Execute the new installer. I would consider re-downloading the game using the same precautions with an Anti-Virus. Some of them check and corrupt files as they are being downloaded.  Make sure the game is allowed in the Firewall (windows or otherwise) and that Anti-Virus is in Game Mode (if such option exists).  Perform a game file check (should be either in the launcher or a command line, google it) Make sure that all the required software to run the game is indeed installed, and not corrupted.

One of the issues right now is that AFVs have huge view ranges / camo compared to other tanks and can spot other tanks with impunity. While this makes AFVs more relevant, it detracts from other classes more than it adds to AFVs.   One of the ways to deal with it is to poke out and then immediately roll back around the corner. If your spotted indicator goes off, there are people."

ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,OfensiveBias,3,Thu Jun 25 17:15:49 2015 UTC,"Does it say HOW they are fixing it?  I'm still saying War Thunder ""spotting"" system would be much much much better. Real tanks would spot eachother at huge distances if in line of sight."
ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,OfensiveBias,6,Thu Jun 25 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"Here is the problem with the warthunder spotting system in this game; unless you massively rework the maps to reduce open areas, AFVs, light tanks, and to a less extent tank destroyers become prey for MBTs.  how this affects vehicles, by class;  MBTs suddenly become tied with lights as the best class in the game. They have good frontal armor and accurate, hard hitting guns but were previously limited by huge bloom and no view range. now that view range is fixed, they are free to sit way in the back of the map and pick off AFVs with impunity as AFVs no longer have camo.  TDs suffer from this change as they were reliant on camo in order to not get hit. however they also benefit from being able to see and snipe other players at extreme ranges, so they will only be minorly hurt.  Lights will have a harder time flanking as there is no camo, but they currently have the light-tank class bonus and good pen, so they will probably only get hurt a little.  AFVs suffer massively as both their offensive and defensive capabilities are tied to the vision system. They provided sight for the rest of their team as their main offensive function and were protected by shells via their camo. thier primary job has been reduced to a shadow of its previous importance, and their main protection is completely gone.  Their main weapons, autocannons and missiles, are also negatively affected by this change. Autocannons have limited pen and thus require you to get around to the sides of other vehicles to do damage. This is now much harder as AFVs have no camo and other vehicles can engage them far before the AFV can effectively return fire. The only way to mitigate this is to use hard cover to get within brawling range, but this is largely no-existent on the majority of current maps, not to mention that it puts you at a disadvantage to other classes that do not have to do this to be effective.   Missiles are less affected by this change, but in order to use a missile, you have to stay within line of sight of the person you are shooting at for up to seven seconds.considering that in most situations there are one or two viable positions for a missile carrying tank, this means that you have a very good chance of getting shot when this happens. in addition to this, most end tier vehicles either have ERA or anti-missile systems so these changes would affect end-tier AFVs even more.  I can't really speculate on artillery as WT has no analogue and how artillery changes is more reliant on Dev decisions than the changing of vision mechanics.  tl;dr, This change would negatively affect most classes and would make end-tier gameplay even more dominated by MBTs. Yes, you could probably do it, but it would be less fun as a whole.  edit:spelling"
ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,Stygianhound,2,Thu Jun 25 20:29:02 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right and WT spotting system would be bad in AW.

""Unspotted vehicles now have visible tracers The camouflage system was changed - vehicles will now be much easier to spot when they are firing Adjusted the viewrange-affecting modules and equipment: viewrange bonuses are now additive, not cumulative""  I don't believe that the warthunder spotting system is good for tanks that have rounds that fire straight for over a mile."

ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,Sisaroth,0,Thu Jun 25 19:42:53 2015 UTC,Oh the rounds can go straight for much more than a mile.  It could be solved with a bit different map design and a little more thinking than just copying WoT.
ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,Finear,2,Thu Jun 25 17:34:14 2015 UTC,In the patch notes they're fixing maps as well.

ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,imaginary_num6er,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"It isn't just a matter of making the hills taller - certain maps would be completely broken by doing this, as they have spawn points that have a direct line of sight on each other, or close to it.

With all the cheating issues of WOT, imagine if the spotting was clientside and warthunder like?"
ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,Eliminateur,3,Thu Jun 25 22:27:16 2015 UTC,I'm over 2k games in Wot and never encountered anybody actually cheating. only noobs who cry cheating because they were outplayed. It literally doesn't exist.
ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,Hombremaniac,-1,Fri Jun 26 15:34:29 2015 UTC,"That's because everything is server side. Everything being server side makes cheating literally impossible.  Unlike warthunder where someone can just change a tanks texture to have a big red arrow, and since all tanks are technically spotted, it make it really easy."
ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,Terrachova,2,Fri Jun 26 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"So, what role should AFV fill? Or other scouts then?  We can't get better weapons because MBT's will whine, so what will these classes do?  Nah, I love the spotting mechanics. This is an arcade game. We have different tanks filling different roles, all together building a good team-play experience."
ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,Regyn,2,Fri Jun 26 01:47:40 2015 UTC,The next patch is trying to do some changes to the system to stop being sprayed by invisi-tanks and make view ranges for AFVs more reasonable.
ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,Tarnsman4Life,2,Thu Jun 25 19:56:07 2015 UTC,"My biggest gripe is the intentional spotting delay when a MBT tries to  spot a light or AFV in close-range. AFVs and light tanks have a bonus where there's a server-side delay in becoming spotted so that if they know what they're doing, they could pop out of cover 1 second, fire, and then go back into cover with the MBT only seeing the tank moving back into cover after receiving a shot.   I personally don't understand why this mechanic is needed. See here"
ArmoredWarfare,3b3d1m,OmgitsSexyChase,2,Fri Jun 26 07:00:18 2015 UTC,"Well I'm also one of the many people, who dislike spotting system as it is now.  I drive MBT, which is virtually ""blind"" and I have to rely on team mates who drive scout vehicles to do the job of scouting.  While on paper it all looks reasonable, in reality (game) it makes MBT the most dependable on others, right after artillery ofc.  People wonder why often players camp, but in many cases it can be just because of being affraid of killed by invisible killers in few seconds, no matter that you drive supposedly heavily armored vehicle and face your (invisible) enemies.  Game is months from open beta and I hope that devs can come up with some adjustments to make this more bearable."
ArmoredWarfare,3b2qvm,Throwcore,7,Thu Jun 25 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"I would not say armored warfare is ""miles ahead"" of world of tanks in the balance department. It's getting better, but it still has serious problems with vehicle balance that need to be addressed.  Not trying to be a debbie downer, just don't expect AW to be knocking WOT out of the park yet. It still has a long way to go.  You are at least right about artillery though."
ArmoredWarfare,3b2qvm,pyrosity,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:10:05 2015 UTC,well i really don't care about it knocking it out of the park. I was just going by 1month old AW footage where both MBTs and artillery looks SO Much more fun to play and so much more balanced.   At firts look (based on the vids I've seen of a guy playing a variety of T4-t8 tanks) it seems a lot harder to bounce in your tank in this game but easier to score damage and so it seems like tanks are a lot more vulnerable overall. But this isn't necessarily bad.
ArmoredWarfare,3b2qvm,Bluenosedcoop,2,Thu Jun 25 15:13:41 2015 UTC,"Ye what pyrosity said it's a good game at the moment but it has it's many flaws that need worked out.  Next patch should hopefully work to fix the spotting and camo system problems, Another problem at the moment is that it appears that tier 6 upwards comes with massive alpha power creep that seems out of proportion with tank HP."
ArmoredWarfare,3b2qvm,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:45:40 2015 UTC,I'd say WoT has the best balance of the three current games.  Currently it's mostly just mechanical issues that are easily changed. Every stat is easily modified unlike WoT which has more historical necessities.
ArmoredWarfare,3b2qvm,theycallhimthestug,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:50:54 2015 UTC,"I think from what I've seen AW has got the basics infinitely better. To start with I see lower tier tanks being able to stand a chance against higher tier tanks (and since AW seems to have the same T4 gets matched with possibly T7 mindset this is a necessity. Usually in Wot except for a few really good vehicles, if you get matched +2 tiers or +3 tiers as a tank there is nearly nothing you can do all game because there are tanks that you can't even pen from the sides. From AW videos I've seen so far this is not the case).  There's also the fact that artillery design is better from the fucking get go by about 200%. It's fun to play, still rewarding and still hits hard if you direct hit them but it also doesn't ruin the players day if you do hit them. Counter artillery is also fun and you can't remain stationary and the ping system gives enemy tanks a chance to retaliate immediately. It's also more fun to play arty because you actually fucking hit targets (actually even in Wot it might be possible to have an arty that is accurate most of the time but I haven't gotten there as I'm only in a T6 arty with a 70% crew and they miss quite a bit. Maybe if it's 110% crew with vents and full BIA and the crew consumable it's a LOT better. So it's possible WOT has accurate arty too but it's a pain in the fucking ass to get there). AW arty is accurate from the get go.  There is also the fact that i would just personally prefer to play the modern tanks in AW over old tanks in Wot if not for anything else but for their speed. It's just fun to have all tanks be able to go like 40 or 50 kmh due to them being modern instead of spending a lot of time trudging along at 20km.  And finally AW has only a 15sec waiting time instead of the stupidly designed 30sec wait time Wot has. I know it's minor but it's a great change.  For a game that is only in alpha I think it's going to completely demolish WOT in the balance department once later iterations of the game arrive (beta, open beta, release)."

And as for anybody actually believeing that scout tanks are better than their same tier mediums... lmfao. Mediums oftentimes have equal or better view range, better armor, better guns, and more hp. Mediums are literally superior in every single fucking way except maybe mobility. Which is another reason why Wot MM is completely and utterly imbalanced as it is. If anything scouts should get MM 1 tier lower than any1 else."

The AMX elc bis is an 5 scout tank. Period. There is no going around this fact. It's just a fact. Like space is vast, blue is a color, and the sun is a big globe of hydrogen and helium.  Just because in theory they are weighted AS a medium with +1 (which is true, although it's very stupid) doesn't change their actual tier. pfft... not wasting anymore time. I'm tired of 14 year old from this game who think they know shit.   edit: also your comparison link is funny because the Ru 251 is one of the best scout tanks, hell one of the best tanks overall in the game. It's insane what you can do in that little beast of a tank. God mode DPM, mobility, and stealthiness. But it's tier 8 (lower scouts tend to suck more) and not every scout is NEARLY that good."

We're in ""closed beta"" early access right now, so I expect there will be a wipe when we transition into open beta.  As for founder packs...  For the cheapest pack at 14€, you can start playing, when the servers are on, and 24h/day when weekend. And you get 15 days of premium status (when open beta/release comes), 5€ of premium currency, open beta HEAD START (figures no wipe after OB) and your nickname is reserved, so you don't need to spend an hour trying the nicknames out.

ArmoredWarfare,3ayf5i,yosp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:20:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of MBTs, maybe.  AFVs, Light Tanks, and TDs... not so much.  HEAT at least punches right through them, and will be key in eliminating those threats quickly."
ArmoredWarfare,3ayf5i,Terrachova,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:44:09 2015 UTC,Doesn't HEAT get blocked by ERA and HE both take out ERA and do damage? Or is it the opposite?

My point was, though, that ERA's more common on MBTs than the other classes.  It won't see much use against other MBTs, but the high-damage HEAT is great against poorly armored targets.  As for the T8s?  Flank.  Or pelt away with HE that still magically does damage from the front."

If the two got into a brawl, be it face hugging or at a distance, the T-80 would win every time except for the rare situation the Leopard 2 pens it every time. For that to happen, the T-80 either has to be showing its sides or not hiding its lower plate. If it keeps pointed forwards and hides the lower plate, then the turret will be an iffy shot for the Leopard 2, penning only when lucky. The T-80 will say ""Fuck you!"" and shoot right through the turret, the upper plate, the lower plate, the gun, anywhere it wants to.   I feel like I should mention that the Leopard 2A5 at tier 8 hits for 720 average with the top shell. Something's wrong with the damage scaling."

Faster and smaller... but less damage (pretty sure a VBL can't clip out a BMP-2, whereas a BMP-2 can definitely clip out a VBL), less agile (tracked vs wheeled, its a slight difference), and has to choose between missiles or autocannon, whereas the BMP-2 has both.

ArmoredWarfare,3ayf5i,TheAylius,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:25:54 2015 UTC,Being invisible and seeing every enemy within 500m is pretty a powerful characteristic of the VBL. Whereas the BMP-2 is spotted from miles away and is blind as a bat. Having no armour means you need information about the enemy location and you need to keep hidden. the BMP-2 can't do either of these things but the VBL can.

ArmoredWarfare,3ayf5i,OtterTenet,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:09:11 2015 UTC,"Thermobaric weapon:       A thermobaric weapon is a type of explosive that utilizes oxygen from the surrounding air to generate an intense, high-temperature explosion, and in practice the blast wave such a weapon produces is typically significantly longer in duration than a conventional condensed explosive. The fuel-air bomb is one of the most well-known types of thermobaric weapons.  Most conventional explosives consist of a fuel-oxidizer premix (gunpowder, for example, contains 25% fuel and 75% oxidizer), whereas thermobaric weapons are almost 100% fuel, so thermobaric weapons are significantly more energetic than conventional condensed explosives of equal weight. Their reliance on atmospheric oxygen makes them unsuitable for use underwater, at high altitude, and in adverse weather. They do, however, cause considerably more destruction when used inside confined environments such as tunnels, caves, and bunkers - partly due to the sustained blast wave, and partly by consuming the available oxygen inside those confined spaces.  There are many different types of thermobaric weapons rounds that can be fitted to hand-held launchers.

T-62 can hit 60 on a road as can the M60, and the Leo gets up to 65 as well.  Thing is, the fact it's an MBT with poor armor is going to hurt it severely.  The T80 already has a 950 avg damage HEAT round, and the T90s is likely to be stronger.  And, as an MBT, it will have crappy camo and no view range... but it won't have the armor to compensate, judging by the implied description.

ArmoredWarfare,3aua1r,Siriothrax,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"One more dev note from the thread. Posted by Obsidian_Arbiter.    http://aw.my.com/en/forum/showthread.php?17826-Early-Access-3-Patchnotes&p=275228&viewfull=1#post275228   Hey all,  I just wanted to let you all know that these changes don't represent anywhere near everything we've been working on in terms of vehicle balance. These changes are things we worked on weeks ago, after which the build needed to go through extensive testing and stabilization to make sure it could be properly deployed to the public.  We've been carefully gathering feedback and data from the playtests and we're definitely making more incremental changes to individual vehicles. To give you a general idea, we've already implemented buffs to the BMP-1, Chieftain, and Leopard 2AV internally that are being tested right now. We're also looking closely at some vehicles that might be too strong at the moment (such as the M60A3 and the Stingrays).  In terms of the penetration changes, these came from parsing data from our armor designers about MBT armor thicknesses with angling and composition taken into account at each tier of play. The intent behind the changes is to improve MBT armor by making them more reliably able to deflect shells with their strongest armor areas. There will still be weaknesses (e.g. the lower glacis for the T-series, etc.), but we were finding that it was too easy for MBTs to penetrate other MBTs in areas that were supposed to be their strongest armor locations (e.g. the front of the M60's turret).   This also helped to correct problems where some powerful autocannons were able to destroy MBTs extremely quickly before. For example, prior to this change, a BMD-2 was able to reliably penetrate the side armor on a T-72 and kill it in less than a single clip of ammunition. With this change, the BMD-2 can still kill a T-72 very quickly if it finds a weak spot or targets the rear armor, but the stock rounds will not reliably penetrate the T-72's side hull armor with every shot.  In our internal playtests, these changes have helped make MBTs feel significantly more resilient by making their armor more reliable. We're continuing to monitor these changes closely and making more individual balance changes as needed."

ArmoredWarfare,3aua1r,jonttu125,2,Tue Jun 23 20:47:54 2015 UTC,26 would still be a real weird clip size. Plus the 2A42 is belt-fed. And cannot be reloaded without expending the entire belt.

ArmoredWarfare,3aua1r,imaginary_num6er,0,Tue Jun 23 23:10:45 2015 UTC,Don't forget the 25% view range bonus that AFV's have when stationary. That's what made the swingfire with the 505m view range OP. It was practically able to stay still at 100% camo with a view range of 631 meters.

ArmoredWarfare,3augx7,Tarnsman4Life,2,Tue Jun 23 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"It is an MBT by the description below and also by the filled in diamond shape next to it in the tech tree. Maybe these are just EA placeholder tech trees, but if you look at the Chiefton line it goes MBT to light and back to MBT too.    C1 Ariete  The C1 Ariete is an Italian main battle tank. Of all the tier 8 main battle tanks it is perhaps the one with least armor but its mobility as well as the Oto Melara 120mm gun make up for that handicap."
ArmoredWarfare,3atf4k,G18AkimboPro,5,Tue Jun 23 10:51:57 2015 UTC,"For those browsing from work.  DISCLAIMER: The statistics are based on my own performance in both games. While very good indicators, they are no definitive proof of anything. A player of similar skill and performance however will need a similar amount of matches to reach tier “X”.  Also another small note. I decided to create a new thread instead of posting this in my stickied topic, because it has become quite chaotic by now. By creating a new topic I hope that it becomes more clear for the readers.     As a lot of the discussion on the topic of progression so far has been relatively superficial, I decided to conduct a small analysis in the hopes of offering better data and sources and thus increase the quality of the discussions overall.  Main goal of this analysis will be the comparison between Armored Warfare and its closest established competitor World of Tanks.   As reference data I have used my most recent ~300 matches in World of Tanks. I’m using my  recent performance instead of my overall performance to more accurately compare the two games, as a lot of the experience gathered in WoT does translate to AW.   You can check them here:  http://www.noobmeter.com/player/eu/g18akimbonoob/504140041/  http://i.imgur.com/7yzNfCt.png  Furthermore, the XP cost value for every tier in WoT is the result of the cost of the next tank in line and the xp cost of all upgrades of the previous tank (with the exception of the radio module upgrades and previously unlocked modules).   As in Armored Warfare XP that were used for upgrades aren’t removed from the progression towards the next vehicle, this is the best possible way to compare the progression in both games.   The sample that I will compare to this reference data are 164 matches played between the tiers 3 and 5 (as I played varying tiers in the reference data as well). The matches were all played alone without platoon and with stock vehicles that got upgraded along the way.   Here are the results in comparison with World of Tanks.   http://i.imgur.com/FYh7fh5.png  Comparing the progression directly tier for tier, Armored Warfare takes longer in each of the 7 tiers. Furthermore the increase in XP needed to progress per tier (that exists in both games) is bigger in Armored Warfare as well.  It is very noticeable that AW’s progression appears to be offset by one tier if compared to WoT. Where WoT’s first XP “spike” (big/exponential increase in XP costs) is set at tier 6, it appears in AW by tier 5 already. While the maximum tier is set at tier 8 in AW, its already confirmed that tier 9 and 10 will be added later on. However it is unknown when these tiers will be added, so for the time being tier 7(8 in obt) should be considered the maximum tier.   Comparing the overall progression from tier 1 to tier “X” the same thing can be observed as you can see here.   http://i.imgur.com/czKJzgO.png  AW’s XP curve closely resembles the curve of WoT offset by 1 tier.   Still it should be mentioned that the progression in World of Tanks does a huge jump in the tiers 9 and 10. Obsidian should generally avoid such a harsh increase. The current high tier curve should be flattened a little more, and the cost in the early tiers 1-4 should be increased  more. As it is currently, the grind in tiers 1 to 3 is too short, while the high tiers may turn out too long.   That is my own personal opinion however.  If you wish to, you can look at the exact value comparisons here  http://i.imgur.com/hKsBDLl.png  Now more in detail information about how the analysis was conducted.  As stated in the introduction, the Graphs are based on my own performance in a total of 164 matches.  First some general notes. Initially I tried out different classes – Arty, Light tanks, TDs and MBTs – but all of them are focused on damage, that’s why I have chosen damage as main metric to measure my own performance in relation to the rewards. By the end of my analysis I have mainly focused on MBTs.  Here you can see that I scored an average of 2027 damage and earned about 994 XP and 60461 Credits per match. My solo win rate in this sample is at 53.05%.  It was generally expected that my performance and rewards increased the higher the tier. However there is an unexpected drop in tier 4. The main reason for this drop is the imperfect matchmaking, every now and then pulling tier 4 and 5 tanks into tier 7 matches. In a released state without matchmaking issues, the tier 4 performance can be expected to be in-between tier 3 and 5 and the t5 performance a little higher than it is now.   An additional factor is matches played on the weekend. It’s a rule of thumb that team and gameplay quality drop significantly on the weekend as more players and specifically more casual players enjoy the game. However this phenomenon influences my performance and winrate both in Armored Warfare and World of Tanks so it doesn’t negatively influence the comparison.  http://i.imgur.com/BtuK8uv.png  From my observations, this level of performance in comparison to the overall AW community is usually placed in the top 3 to top 5 per match.  To give a rough perspective, I think the majority is somewhat below that. While I haven’t gone through the massive extra effort of analyzing other people as well (really, you’d have to pay me if I was to go that far), I’d say the average performance of people in MBTs is closer to or slightly below their own HP pool in damage, so an average of 1000-1300 damage between tier 3 to 5 seems realistic. To make this very clear however. This is just my own impression and should thus be considered an assumption in the context of the analysis.   If you are interested in the data of the actual matches, you can see them here:  http://i.imgur.com/GivoyHR.png http://i.imgur.com/YmCAzRy.png http://i.imgur.com/O1NG7V8.png    Lastly to address some of the voices claiming that progression is “way faster” than WoT or similar claims. Evidently, this is not the case.   However there are many reasons why it appeared that way to a group of people.     Time invested.    Some took the opportunity to play whenever they could from EA 1 on onwards     Platoons.    With a 3 man platoon of skilled players, you can boost your win rate by 10% to even 20%. Furthermore you will perform better yourself as well, as you can count on backup in the majority of cases where a random player may not have the awareness.     Skill and previous experience (Alpha).   Those that played WoT long enough to reach unicum level or above, as well as those that had the opportunity to play AW during alpha already got a relatively big advantage if compared to the “new” player. They will be used to the general feel of gameplay, general mechanics as well as tactics, with the alphas having additional map and vehicle knowledge as well.      Upgrade mechanics   In general the vehicles in Armored Warfare are a lot more competitive even when not yet upgraded. As a result the frustration in grinding, that many people associate with this stockgrind, isn’t nearly as bad as it is in WoT thus seeming a lot shorter/more pleasant.   These reasons together lead to in my opinion the biggest reason for this perception.   I’ll call it overgrinding here.  To make an example. Where the usual player would be at tier 3, people to whom the above applies would be able to reach tier 4 while still meeting the lower tier players due to low player numbers. In other words the “privilege” to play as top tier almost exclusively.   To draw the picture further, when the first few average players reach tier 4, this group will have t5s ready to play. As they are still a minority, they will be put into matches with tier 3 and 4, essentially allowing to farm off the players with less experience, with less time and/or without platoon.  As the power difference between tiers is indeed relatively significant, I decided to use the word farm here.   I think these factors together are the reason for the distorted perception of progression.   Thank you for reading! Feel free to give feedback or share your experience below!  Big thanks to Shrubberycollector, Angrybanana und Xen as well as the forum community for giving me constant feedback from an ""outside"" perspective, helping me to structure it so that its more easily understandable as a reader!  EDIT: Another small note. Halfway through the analysis I had removed a small sample via standard deviation. However after talking to friend of mine with statistics education I decided to go through the effort and return them back in. He told me that one should never remove samples for reasons of an arbitary total size. Sorry for the confusion :/"
ArmoredWarfare,3atf4k,OtterTenet,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:53:42 2015 UTC,You are amazing! Kudos for the excellent writeup.   It's exactly what was needed to put some facts into the grind discussion.
ArmoredWarfare,3atf4k,Salaris,3,Tue Jun 23 20:44:33 2015 UTC,"This is a really interesting post, thank you. We have our own internal data for progression rates, but it's always fun to see an individual player's observations.  I haven't looked at this in a ton of detail yet, but it looks like you're taking your average Reputation and Credits earned across all matches and then dividing the cost per tier by these average values. If that's how you're generating your charts, it won't be accurate, since your Reputation earned per match and average Credits earned per match are going to be different on a tier-by-tier basis. The more you play a particular tier, the more it'll skew toward that average.  If you're already going based on average earnings on a per tier basis that's great - it just didn't look like it from my quick examination.  It also looks like you might be playing higher tier vehicles in WoT than in AW to determine your average earnings per match, which would also skew your statistics if that's true. (You're also a much better player than I am. =P) Again, maybe I'm just reading your charts incorrectly.   Also, for the Credits side, are you using gross earnings or net earnings? If that's the case, it's going to be making your numbers appear higher than what you're actually earning.   We've tried to be pretty generous with Credits in Armored Warfare, but I know that from my own experience in World of Tanks their Silver earnings get pretty punitive (and sometimes even negative) at the high tiers in that game. That would have a major influence on the actual number of matches to reach any given tier if you have to slow down due to Credits or Silver income.  Thanks for posting this!"

The more you play a particular tier, the more it'll skew toward that average.   Youre right, it isnt as accurate as i wish it would be because performance should/does grow with higher tiers.  However to compensate for that, the amount of matches played is disproportional (well, tier 3 vs tier 4/5 is, anyway). Now I havent got to play in tiers 6 and 7, but i only got so much time and wanted to finish the initial analysis before EA2 ended as it wasnt clear what will change in the next update.  For more detail check here , I did my best to make it easy and fast to see the points of interest.    If you're already going based on average earnings on a per tier basis that's great - it just didn't look like it from my quick examination.   I decided against that way for now to keep it simple, afterall this is primarily an effort for the community and too many graphs may make it too much information for the reader that is just interested in results.   Funnily enough my performance in the 3 tiers 3/4/5 didnt quite diverge as much as i expected.   As stated in the original posting, i primarily see the reason for that in varying quality matchmaking and a drop in team quality on weekends (the t72 was pretty much only played this weekend). Maybe i didnt quite ""grow into"" the t72, so the difference isnt very big for (lack of) skill reasons.   It also looks like you might be playing higher tier vehicles in WoT than in AW to determine your average earnings per match, which would also skew your statistics if that's true. (You're also a much better player than I am. =P) Again, maybe I'm just reading your charts incorrectly.    Youre partially right. For the 293 matches the tiers range from tier 6 to 9, but they are more on the high tier side indeed. I decided against using my overall average xp because I believe that the experience gathered in wot translated well enough overhere, thus getting a more accurate picture by looking at my recent performances.    Also, for the Credits side, are you using gross earnings or net earnings? If that's the case, it's going to be making your numbers appear higher than what you're actually earning.    On the credits, I didnt really intend to do much with them, but decided to add them in the statistics anyway if i decide to use them later. Thats why i used the raw reward after the match, without removing repairs and ammo costs. (That wouldve been quite some extra effort too, because the adjusted value after costs isnt visible on the scorecard immediately. Going through the information UI on the right after every match wouldve been too much for me :D ).  EDIT: Here is what the adjusted graph would look like, with tier 6 and 7 using the average XP of my tier 5 games. http://i.imgur.com/qEQzxgh.png"
ArmoredWarfare,3atf4k,PhilosophizingCowboy,2,Wed Jun 24 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"That all makes sense. Thanks for the quick reply.  I definitely think that you'd find the rate of progression in Armored Warfare more comparable to WoT's (if not lower at certain tiers) if you used different earnings values for each tier, but yeah, that'd be a ton of work to figure out. I'm sure gathering all this data was already super time consuming.   We're definitely planning some progression changes that should hopefully make going up in tiers smoother (especially with matchmaking taken into account), but I can't provide any details just yet.  I appreciate that you had enough dedication to put this all together. Hope you're enjoying the game!"
ArmoredWarfare,3atf4k,Finear,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:50:25 2015 UTC,"Excellent job; this also helps to explain the general consensus that we seem to be getting in the forums. Those who made it to tier 5 claiming the grind was almost too fast and those at tier 7 claiming that it takes forever.   Really good job.   Although this does once again beg the quesiton: how much content will there be on release? Until we know this comparing it to WoT only gets us so far. If we stop at Tier 8, then it makes sense for the grind to be longer."
ArmoredWarfare,3atf4k,Ksielvin,2,Tue Jun 23 13:31:03 2015 UTC,"That is still not very clear. The last info i read is that tier 8 will be the maximum at release and t9/10 will come only after that.  While it wasnt confirmed anywhere yet, it appears that the tier 8 tanks will take around 540k xp (the upgrade cost of all upgrades of a tier 7 tank times 2). In the graph that would ~equal world of tanks tier 10 grind.   Though i havent included it in the graphs because that isnt confirmed yet."

ArmoredWarfare,3at8j9,Terrachova,3,Tue Jun 23 11:41:11 2015 UTC,"Do you know how long it takes to put out videos?  A half-hour video can take upwards of a full workday to put out depending on the level of editing, and upload rates and whatnot.  Content producers simply don't have the time we do to grind things out, and since they're amongst the primary advertising AW has... it makes a lot of sense to get them press accounts.  That way, they can focus on showing all that the game has to offer without having to expend time on the grind.  This is especially important when you remember that the Early Access periods are very short.  Most players will never see a tier 7 or 8, and others will usually only see one or two (where the line splits, for instance).  Making providers grind for stuff will result in many tanks never getting shown off."
ArmoredWarfare,3at8j9,grimbal,0,Tue Jun 23 20:33:40 2015 UTC,"Content producers simply don't have the time we do to grind things out   What? How? What are they spending all their time on? Even if they cut video full time, that leaves them with exactly as much time to play as everyone else.   it makes a lot of sense to get them press accounts. That way, they can focus on showing all that the game has to offer without having to expend time on the grind.   Uh... you're going to have to explain this. You think random players should be given special privileges to ""show off the game,"" but one of the privileges is to skip all the gameplay? What exactly are they ""showing off,"" exactly? Normally, when I want to show or describe a game to others, I attempt to convey what the game is actually like based on my experience, rather than conveying a totally fabricated version of the game that nobody but me will ever be able to experience. If you pick a random CS:GO player out of a hat and give him a unique laser rifle that kills in one shot and has no recoil or magazine restriction, he isn't exactly going to give you a good idea of what the game is like. What would you think of a YouTube video of an upcoming MMORPG where a random player had the ability to duplicate any item he wished and generate gold out of thin air? I don't think anyone would agree that the video would be useful in any way for trying to showcase the game.   This is especially important when you remember that the Early Access periods are very short.   Are you serious? Various pre-release events have been running for months. Off the top of my head, I've been playing since at least January, and all I did was sign up on the website.   Making providers grind for stuff will result in many tanks never getting shown off.   This is making less and less sense. For starters, I have no idea why you think high-tier content is not achievable in arbitrarily short periods of time during pre-release. In the very first focus test, players were given high-tier vehicles right off the bat, and the rate at which players progress up the tree is fully within Obsidian's control. They can literally change it whenever they want. Further, if content wasn't achievable, why would it have been put into the game, and wouldn't that just mean nobody could get it? If people who happen to occasionally play on Twitch streams can't possibly get something through legitimate play, why would anyone else be able to? That content basically doesn't exist from the player's perspective. Are you arguing for random players to be awarded unattainable content to show off to people who apparently can't even get it?  I don't think you have a very good idea of how the game is arranged or how making videos about games works."

Just wanna point out on that first bit... they're not using things no one will be able to get.  They're simply playing the upper tiers.  That's it.  As for the rest... well, that's a fine opinion and all that.  If you think these content producers are anything other than advertising for the game, you're wrong, and from an advertising perspective, it makes perfect sense to give them access to everything.  They want people to see the big, mean, cool tanks, not the in between grind-wall tanks because they want people to buy into the game.  That's all it is.  Marketing.  Advertising."

Normally, when someone gets absolutely fucking demolished, they wuss out and just abandon the thread. I guess you get some points for slinking back and mumbling out a half-hearted defense.   Just wanna point out on that first bit... they're not using things no one will be able to get. They're simply playing the upper tiers. That's it.   Literally your entire premise is that content would be locked off to players unless they were given special accounts to access it. If that's not the case, your entire argument disintegrates. If everybody can get all the tanks, why would everybody not just get and play the tanks they wanted?   from an advertising perspective, it makes perfect sense to give them access to everything.   Again, I don't think you know what advertising is. Advertising is when you present a product or service, generally as being desirable to buy. How does essentially axing all the gameplay for your advertisements make any sense? These players are essentially the only people who can't advertise. How are they supposed to give viewers any indication at all of how the game plays out when they won't be engaging in any of it?   They want people to see the big, mean, cool tanks, not the in between grind-wall tanks because they want people to buy into the game.   The ""in-between tanks"" are the game. That's what you're buying. Have you not played Armored Warfare yet? I guess I would encourage you to hop into a few games and see how the tier system works."

The developers probably agree with you... but they're not in charge of marketing.  The bigwigs who generally are feel that showing the biggest, baddest tanks blowing shit up and wrecking face is the best way to attract players.  They're the type that make movie trailers that show all the funny/action parts, and play off pre-rendered CG scenes as gameplay.  The guys that make comically bad showings at E3 trying to be 'hip'.  They want us to see the endgame, the tanks they expect us to want to play and grind for, rather than the grind we're going to have to do to get those tanks.  Think about what Armored Warfare is at its core, and how the general tank playerbase looks at it: World of Tanks with modern tanks.  You and I think differently, but the masses, much like how those in charge of advertising think, want to see the Abrams, the T80/90, the Leopard 2.  Those are what they're coming to AW to play, and those are the tanks the marketing bros want to show off.  It's not about what will actually benefit the game, it's about what those in charge of marketing and advertising think will benefit the game."

ArmoredWarfare,3asno4,atriax,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:15:12 2015 UTC,Having just got the Centauro i'm truly disappointed in the ridiculously bad accuracy it has especially considering that it's meant to be played as a back line sniper.  Aim time i can deal with and the view range at 403m is not bad at all but to have that kind of bad accuracy goes against the class design of TD in my opinion.

And what to do if shit hit the fan.  The healthpool would be around 1500hp at Tier 7, so it it would be possible to 2-3 shot you in a MBT."
ArmoredWarfare,3amwhj,kamlnskl,7,Sun Jun 21 20:08:29 2015 UTC,Pretty safe to assume that's a typo.  That would be nearly 90mph which is roughly 2x the actual top speed of the bmp-3.
ArmoredWarfare,3amwhj,skyzefawlun,6,Sun Jun 21 20:22:32 2015 UTC,What? 88mph doesn't go faster than time?
ArmoredWarfare,3amwhj,imaginary_num6er,5,Sun Jun 21 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"It has a higher top speed, but it has worse acceleration. Top speed isn't important if you don't have the acceleration."
ArmoredWarfare,3amwhj,Crisis7,2,Sun Jun 21 22:18:56 2015 UTC,"I think /u/Crisis7  is trying to say that the engine doesn't have the power to push to that top speed. If you go downhill, you can go a little faster than the 85km/h mark. Terrain modifier is also important."
ArmoredWarfare,3amwhj,yuxin_ma2005,2,Sun Jun 21 23:27:41 2015 UTC,"At that point then it needs to addressed as a typo, a very time consuming typo as I've heard from Kaminski."

ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,PhilosophizingCowboy,7,Sun Jun 21 00:24:22 2015 UTC,"Coming from World of Tanks I find the current gameplay too similar, too frustrating, and not fun.   I've played a lot of WoT, some War Thunder, and now a bit of AW. I'm still very much a noob in AW.  While the WoT spotting system often is considered ""weird"", it's actually quite viable for an arcade game, at least on paper. How much camo a bush provides and the relative view range of each vehicle/tank are the most important parameters. I personally feel that MBTs and scout tanks should have roughly the same view range, while the latter should have increased camo rating. That makes it still possible to scout, without providing huge death zones. Strategy suddenly becomes a more important part of scouting gameplay.  One could also implement the targeting laser (?) that I've seen in AW videoes. Scout tanks will only provide targets if they are lit up, putting the scout at (more) risk than remaining passive.  Map design, rather than core spotting mechanics, seems more important - consider how WoT maps were before getting mostly reworked. Forcing more brawls, ""funnels of death"", and less emphasis on scouting. I don't like this style myself, though it was a ""solution"" to a balancing problem. Maps in AW seems more ""realistic"", but this seems to provide the problem that it's hard to tell where you are spotted from. Large, open zones does indeed provide ideal killing grounds for spotter/sniper teams. The solution? Avoid zones not intended for a slow-ish MBT. There's a reason you don't see heavy tanks driving across the valley on El Halluf in WoT, or even go field on Siegfried Line.  Alas, I know all too well how teamwork doesn't really exist in online games, and that only a minority of the playerbase is devoted to scouting/light tank gameplay. Unless it proves rewarding, both fun- and grind-wise, to play light tanks, few people will. This again will force MBTs to get similar view range as a scout, but with less camo rating."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,aikl,4,Sun Jun 21 08:17:48 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree with you more. I came from a long history with World of Tanks. While it doesn't make much sense from a realism standpoint, it works perfectly fine for an arcade game such as WoT or AW. I will say, though, AW seems to make it easier to know when you are spotted and when enemies have been spotted by you or nearby teammates than WoT does."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,PantsSir,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:42:11 2015 UTC,"Unless it proves rewarding, both fun- and grind-wise, to play light tanks, few people will.   I see AW taking some extremely welcome steps to achieving legitimately fun recon and light tank gameplay. The ATGM and the target mark ability are examples of the sort of innovation I'm glad to see Obsidian trying. There's obviously still time to disappoint me, but in general it looks like doing the right thing and helping your team might actually be the fun thing to do in AW like it's supposed to be."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,grimbal,6,Fri Jun 26 05:25:21 2015 UTC,"I played a lot of WarThunder and yes, I prefer their system A LOT more because you see, what your eye can see.  Being pwned by AFV's and TD's + LT's because I drive blind MBT and my team either does not have scouts or they don't give a damn, always lead to frustration.  On the other hand I am not sure if this can be changed drastically in ArmoredWarfare, since they obviously designed the game as to have WOTisch spoting system from the beginning."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Hombremaniac,3,Sun Jun 21 08:57:37 2015 UTC,"same here, a spotting ""system"" is NOT needed, the moment you try to complicate something that is as simple as ""as far as your eyes/optics/radar/sensor can see"" is the moment your design is essentially flawed. I wish they'd implement a LoS system just like WT  and yes, i dont know how they could fix this at this point i don't think they will do it.  it's pretty stupid that you're advancing down a lane, see the spotted symbol yet you don't see anything and all the sudden you get pelted by 500+DMG BS-missiles plus some hits, boom, MBT lost in less than 10 seconds... very balanced, much fair... all the while, nothing got spotted because y'know, fuck you for advancing as you should, next time stay camping in the base"

ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Vroco,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:44:41 2015 UTC,I still hope they could atleast adjust this system somehow. Maybe lower the differencies in spotting range or something.
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Hombremaniac,2,Sun Jun 21 17:22:16 2015 UTC,and make it that when a tank is IN THE OPEN it will be permalit in line of sight no matter what... it's pretty stupid when a tank vanishes in front of you 500m away with nothing between because of a flawed arcade system
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Eliminateur,7,Tue Jun 23 13:17:03 2015 UTC,"What makes the current system completely worse is that they give the scout line of tanks an ever increasing view range to the point where if you're sitting still as a Wiesel you have nearly double the view range of some of the tanks in the game and you just cannot compete with that.  It makes some areas of maps complete no go areas if the enemy has tanks like Wiesel's and your team don't as i just witnessed on Cold Strike we were on south spawn but the enemy has 2 Wiesel's spotting us from 2 different angles we could not move and we could not fire, The game was over within 3 mins all because of 2 tanks."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Bluenosedcoop,2,Sun Jun 21 12:02:53 2015 UTC,"At the moment a good AFV makes or breaks the game. And to counter a good AFV player you'll need an equally skilled AFV player.   But the problem is not really the AFV, it is more exploiting the mapdesign. I.e. Roughneck the D7 spot nearby the water. If im over there i have plenty of cover and even can fire at 9 line mostly unspotted.  Same for the F0 Position on Coldstrike.  And a spotting Wiesel/VBL is actually quite threatened by a push by a other recon/TD."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,ItumTR,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:55:11 2015 UTC,"I would not call Wiesel a tank, but other than that, I 100% agree with you. I've had my share of dying to barrages from invisible enemies."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Hombremaniac,7,Sun Jun 21 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"Having tanks always rendered will make things even more slanted towards sniping and camping because you would never be able to Attack with surprise - even in a stealthy tank. It makes scouting trivial and encourages deathballing since you always know what you're up against and can spot flank/cap attempts prematurely.  What needs to change is giving mbts armor that is actually functional, and adjusting the difference between stationary and moving camo to be a gradient rather than a binary jump."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Siriothrax,2,Sun Jun 21 01:19:48 2015 UTC,It might work if you were confined to buttoned up view/no third person but as the zoom out mechanics currently stand there's fat chance of that happening.
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Beaverkilla,3,Sun Jun 21 08:38:09 2015 UTC,I don't want the WT system. They should just adapt the numbers more.
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Sisaroth,2,Sun Jun 21 13:46:31 2015 UTC,I tend to play MBT/Heavies and yes AW at the moment is very campy.  I suspect the MBT armour is bugged as well as just about everything seems to be able to pen it.    At the moment it seems the team that camps will win unless the other team can push forward together.
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,My_Thoughts,2,Sun Jun 21 00:54:56 2015 UTC,"Slight off-topic but I think, more than anything right now, we need a clearer idea of how spotting, penetration, damage and mobility works in AW. I've noticed some differences in the way things work between WoT and AW already but can't be sure about it just yet. But, however similar they are, I wouldn't call them identical just yet."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,PantsSir,2,Mon Jun 22 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"Probably tweaking numbers would help make the spotting system more viable.  Right now the gameplay is static and campy. You have both teams waiting for the other team to be spotted by their scouts.   In the CQB areas you don't feel it too much, but it's quite a mess when it comes to open areas.   It's usually a few MBTs and TDs standing there waiting for some scout to spot for them so they can open fire or move.   When there are no scouts around it's all about players patience to wait for the enemy to make a wrong move.  On some maps ( like port ) there are some buildings, dunes and wrecks in the open area, it helps moving without being obliterated.  On some other maps ( like roughneck ) playing without a scout in the open area is basically suicide. There are tons of TDs waiting either on the hill or near the extraction zone, ready to open fire on whoever tries to move a bit.  IMO it's all about working on numbers. How the spotting system works right now ( invisible tanks, viewrange, etc. ) it's not bad for an arcade game. It allows devs to create vehicles that wouldn't be that useful otherwise ( like the VBL or the Wiesel ).   The big problem right now is that the maps stay the same, but the viewrange increases a lot as you get higher tier vehicles. On River point tanks can be spotted as they cross the bridge to get into battle, thats really early into the game.  Not increasing the viewrange too much when you get to higher tiers would be a nice solution in my opinion. Maps wouldn't need to be balanced for viewranges that vary too much but only for a specific number ( lets say from 300 to 400 ). Scouts wouldn't hide behind a building or a mountain (River point - Cold Strike )safe from enemy fire,  instead they would have to relocate to different positions to keep working efficiently."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,leobyt,2,Mon Jun 22 10:19:46 2015 UTC,"You need to research how server and client side processing affects spotting before writing about it. Nice writeup but without considering the anti-hacking side of things it's incomplete.   Edit, I'll elaborate.  In PC Gaming there are technical considerations:   Latency to Server (Ping x 2 + Processing Time) - meaning that a packet has to get from the client to the server, get processed, and return back. The client then uses that information to display the results. Any packet loss or high latency is smoothed out by various methods. Processing Time - each individual client requires a certain amount of processing cycles to update. The more realistic the game model, the more cycles are required. This directly translates to the Server Costs to operate the game server.  Everything the server sends to the client can be read by another script or program on the Gamer's PC. Even things the player isn't supposed to see. This means that the Vision system has to be entirely Server-Side. If it's client side, Wall-Hacks will rapidly infest the game.   For these reasons the developers cannot create a realistic ""what the player spots"" vision system. War Thunder is actually a security failure with indefensible paths of attack:   Change Texture Files to color all enemy tanks Bright Pink with an arrow on top.  Read incoming Packets and display the results as enemy tank outlines.    There are technical variations on the above.   So based on your suggestion, the only features that can work are the unlimited view range for all tanks, and the scout change. None of the camo stuff will work because it will be bypassed.  I'm not convinced that unlimited view range will make a better game.  There may be a way to tweak some of the reveal conditions with the current system - by modifying the camo lost on firing, etc.   Perhaps they can add a client side system that doesn't depend on revealing live positions, but instead shows a fuzzy mark from where incoming fire is detected. That could be a realistic upgraded system on the more modern tanks."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,OtterTenet,2,Sun Jun 21 03:48:49 2015 UTC,"Not to be overly pedantic, but just mentioning a few things:   Latency to Server (Ping x 2 + Processing Time)   Ping is round-trip time (so the total time is ping + processing time) while latency is actually one-way time (just the delay to the server, ping/2).   The more realistic the game model, the more cycles are required.   I know there's some inherent simplification to explaining things to people on the internet, but note that these extra cycles can actually be caused by unrealistic mechanics. As an example, the current spotting system requires constant line-of-sight checks between each tank by the server whereas a system without any spotting mechanics could require no such checks depending on implementation.   Everything the server sends to the client can be read by another script or program on the Gamer's PC. Even things the player isn't supposed to see. This means that the Vision system has to be entirely Server-Side. If it's client side, Wall-Hacks will rapidly infest the game.   The above is true and I personally don't believe the AW devs have what it takes to create a fully fleshed-out anti-hacking system. Nearly every modern FPS suffers from a cheating problem, even when tens of millions of dollars are being pumped into them, and this is because your client does know where the enemy players are even when you can't see them.   Perhaps they can add a client side system that doesn't depend on revealing live positions, but instead shows a fuzzy mark from where incoming fire is detected.   To be fair, this is nearly what the hitmarkers do; they show you a general direction of where the enemy is without telling you specifically. However, something that would tell your entire team could be useful.    The main point to focus on here, in my opinion, is how the spotting system adds to gameplay. It isn't simply an anti-hacking tool or a way to lower system requirements (as either could be mitigated in other ways); it was put in place for specific gameplay reasons, and people seem to be forgetting that. It makes the scout tanks unique and vital to a team. While it may be frustrating to run around in an MBT and not be able to see much, first, some numbers can be tweaked to lower that frustration, but second, that's why the other tanks are important. If MBTs could do everything themselves, why would anyone play a class that has much less offensive strength and much less defense (like an AFV)? Some people enjoy the gameplay where they don't just shoot at everything that moves; they tactically approach situations and provide the vision that the rest of their team needs while trying to stay hidden and silent for the majority of the match.  The game might be more popular if MBTs could do everything and there was no reason to not play an MBT, but that's simply not how the game was designed. I think we should be discussing the real influences behind why the spotting system is what it is if people want to change it, because right now this thread is full of a lot of people saying ""realistic spotting is better but they used this spotting system for <insert_non-gameplay-related_reason_here>""."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Zulunko,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:32:22 2015 UTC,"I mixed up latency and ping, uh oh. Thank you for the correction.  Re: Server cycles - the current system is unlikely ""constant"".  In WoT the time between updates went up to multiple seconds depending on distance.  http://wiki.wargaming.net/en/Battle_Mechanics#Rate_of_Visibility_Checks   You will not necessarily spot an enemy tank as soon as you have line of sight on it. The rate of visibility checks is limited as follows:   within 50 m range - every 0.1 sec within 150 m range - every 0.5 sec within 270 m range - every 1.0 sec within 445 m range - every 2.0 sec   NOTE: While Overlord confirmed the above as still correct for 0.7.1, US community manager Vallther claimed on 23 January 2012 that the frequency of the visibility checks depends ""a lot on the map"" and that he ""requested a total check from Q&A regarding the matter"". [2]  The rate limitation on visibility checks means that it is entirely possible that a hidden tank moves out of cover right after a visibility check, shoots you, and returns back into cover right before the next visibility check, thus never getting spotted and staying hidden. This can also lead to fast tanks getting spotted only closer to you than your spotting range would normally allow - at a maximum speed of 72 km/h a tank can cross 40m between spotting checks past 270m range."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,OtterTenet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:26:16 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that WoT (and likely AW) reduced the frequency of line-of-sight checks for spotting based on distance, but it is still true that doing these line-of-sight checks requires more processing than not doing them (and they do occur over and over again throughout the game for every single player in range of every other player, around 5 or 6 per tank (at least in WoT), resulting in dozens of checks per second in the best case and far more in the worst case). The only issue I had with your statement was the implication that more realism always means more server processing (""[t]he more realistic the game model, the more cycles are required""), while in this case it could actually be less, as you wouldn't need these line-of-sight checks."

ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,ShadowSVK,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:57:35 2015 UTC,"Most matches I play involve the MBT's sparring at standoff ranges and when one side feels they have an advantage they push. AFV's will scout some, go after other AFV's, gang up on lone MBT's, or try and flank. IMO the AFV flanking/infiltration mission in most maps is useless.   Swingfires especially make tank sniping on some maps impossible as anything but another swingfire will be unable to spot the enemy swingfire before they shoot. I imagine on higher tier tanks with more smoke, ERA, etc this is less of an issue.   The #1 solution would be to give other reece type vehicles more vision range, #2 increase the visibility of any vehicle firing an ATGM greatly for say 10 seconds after firing, give MORE AFV's ATGM's to spar with the swingfires and other ATGM carriers(just like IRL) and give T3 MBT's smoke. Give T3 1 charge, T4 2, etc until you get into APS on higher tier tanks."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,Tarnsman4Life,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:38:44 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of problems with AW, but I actually approve of how it handles view range and spotting in general. There are naturally some specific cases where I believe the implementation may be buggy or a given vehicle may have an unbalanced value, but I consider those sorts of things to be minor details for the purposes of this discussion.  One, not all vehicles can reliably hide. Just as MBT's cannot see, they also cannot avoid being seen. You can't really be stealthily destroyed by an MBT. He can't see shit, and as soon as he does anything (or nothing,) you'll see him. Even if you're in an MBT, the only vehicles that can really hide from you are the ones that are supposed to be able to, like TD's and AFV's. If you're both in MBT's, you'll just sort of blunder into each other a few hundred meters out, well within range of both your guns.  Two, any view range difference will get sorted out the moment one of you fires. MBT's and other non-stealthy vehicles are not intended to be able to hide, and as soon as they fire, everyone in the area will know. That means any advantages conveyed by the spotting system last for a maximum of one shot. If I shoot at you, obviously I can see you, and now you can see me, unless I'm in some kind of specialty vehicle like a TD or SPG.  Three, and this is big, everyone gets Sixth Sense for free. In WoT,most players are intended to have Sixth Sense (a perk that gives you an indicator after an enemy has spotted you,) but it's actually very difficult to get. A player who reaches WoT's fifth tier may well have not gotten Sixth Sense on any of his crews, there are only ten tiers in WoT, and the perk is specific to the crew member that earns it, so earning it once isn't enough. In AW it's not a perk and everyone just has it. Obsidian dodged a huge bullet by not making the same design mistake. A WoT player isn't really playing WoT until a few thousand game's worth of grinding for basic necessities, but an AW player is playing the game as it was intended much faster.  Four, penetration and armor vastly reduces the importance of low-powered gunfire. In regular shooters, if I hit you, your health goes down. Ten pistol shots to the chest are just as deadly as one rifle round to the head. In AW, ten autocannon shots from an AFV are absolutely not anywhere near as deadly as one AP shell from a full-size cannon. The cannon is likely to penetrate and deal damage, and the autocannon rounds are very much not (although changes since the focus test have buffed AFV firepower pretty much across the board, so we'll see.) The upside is that an AFV can hide from you, but it can't actually use that stealth to assassinate your heavy hitters. This is one of the reasons why ""invisible fire from nowhere"" isn't an insurmountable problem for MBT's and other well-armored but ungainly tanks. The overwhelming majority of that invisible fire means jack shit. It will never kill you, or even hurt you, and it gives you information about where your attacker is. He would be better off reporting on your position to others, which brings us to:  Five, and this is the real killer, the spotting mechanic exists to encourage scouting. MBT's can't see shit because they don't have to. They can hit you from miles away as long as anyone else on their team has laid eyes on you. Because non-SPG tanks use direct-fire weapons, and even the ATGM requires line of sight to guide the missile, anyone you attack can probably see you. That means his entire team can see you as well. You aren't blind beyond your view range, you're blind beyond the combined view ranges of your entire team (plus I think there's a maximum draw distance like in WoT, but work with me here.) This is why an ""always visible if line of sight exists"" system is bad. AFV's and TD's rely on being invisible to do their jobs. AFV's can't actually fight very well, but they can lurk and support the team more than any autocannon could. TD's get the best of both worlds as far as both hiding and shooting, but only if someone else is pointing out targets. (Do note the Swingfire, which can basically spot for itself, and totally does not need a nerf there is nothing wrong with the Swingfire I should totally be able to kill anyone I want with a missile from anywhere no obsidian pls no nerf pls)  Bottom line: the spotting mechanic exists as it does so that teams can help each other by providing spots and coordinating fire on targets that one single vehicle might not have been able to see. The ability to spot also implies the ability to hide, which gives us interesting gameplay strategies like stealthy snipey Tank Destroyers picking off other tanks and sneaky spray-y AFV's getting places they shouldn't be and bullying the smaller, weaker tanks they find there. Without spotting, the game would be extremely one-dimensional."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,grimbal,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:13:56 2015 UTC,"I would lower ALL tanks viewrange. And give AFV's the largest. Followed by lights, followed by MBT's, followed by tds. But the difference wouldn't be like it is right now (500 swingfire vs. 350 on the leo). It would be like 75 at most. I've won a lot of games for my taem in the sheridan just by spotting and letting my team shred them. Unfortunately as new as the game is a lot of people aren't good at that, which leads to campy teams."
ArmoredWarfare,3ak70c,atriax,0,Sun Jun 21 02:02:42 2015 UTC,"I would agree that the view range on the Swingfire line of AFVs is way too great at the moment.(It's much less of a problem with BMPs and BMDs because their ""curve"" starts at a much lower value of around 370ish.  I love playing AFVs but having those huge view ranges just promotes camping, stationary tactics and takes away from the scout gameplay, instead turning it into a game of ""sit in bush, aim at guy, call for fire support""  which really isn't that fun.  The strength of Armored Warfare, to me, is the pace of the game. Anything that slows that down does the game a disservice imo."

Every single scenario that you're shot with an ATGM an AP round would have hit you faster, and without warning. Anyone who has an issue with ATGM's has an issue with the vehicle firing it, not the munition itself. It's literally a slower traveling AP round that gets destroyed by ERA and give the opposing tank a warning. I would rather get ATGM's fired at me all day vs. AP."

I don't know if he just wanted to make a click baity controversial video or if hes actually being genuine about hes child like behavior but either way I wish I could unview the video and that we could all just ignore this and not give it more attention that it deserves.

Then someone has posted it on reddit.  How exactly is that clickbait? The title is a pun, just like all my other AW video titles. Clickbait would have been if I had called it  ""Are WoT veterans really all gross, basement dwelling jerks?"" or ""Swingfire is the cancer of AW!!!!""  That's clickbait. Now if you don't like what I have to say, that's fine but you are sitting here calling my video childish, unnecessary, inaccurate and biased.... you hypocrite :P You just did exactly the same thing I did.

ArmoredWarfare,3ai9cy,eLdritch_MD,6,Sat Jun 20 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I said it may have been fabricated opinions to give you the benefit of the doubt. Really if that is not the case then the video is just bad its 80% just you whining about how all world of tanks players hate arty and for some reason asking Obsidian to not listen to them. The difference being that unlike you Obsidian is actually sane and doesn't want to alienate a large portion of its player base, you know that portion spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on that other f2p tanks game.  If all that you want is for artillery to remain in the game why not make a argument for artillery with things like facts and statistics rather than some emotional speech about how wot players cant be trusted and that things will never change because reasons.   By the way spgs have little to nothing to do with tank warfare they are specifically used for indirect fire against things like towns or for areal denial. Never are they used in specific target anti tank roles. So that whole statement about them being 'pivotal' to modern vehicle combat is just wrong. Its not at all on the scale of this arcade game.  Finally to break your weird clearly emotion driven stereo type of world of tanks players. I would, in fact, as a world of tanks player, like to see if they can fix artillery and make it a fun part of the game. The difference is I'll use things like facts and observations to judge whether or not they should be in the game instead of arbitrary vehicle groupings and baseless emotional rants about sections of the community."

ArmoredWarfare,3ai9cy,FragmentNation,0,Sun Jun 21 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"I did that last time. Made a nice video about artillery after the first early access, said I thought it was rather meh and didn't feel rewarding and counter artillery was a rather annoying, easily skippable gimmick and lo and behold, the anti artillery association came swooping in from all sides berrating me for my audacity because after all, artillery is cancer...  After that, I've rather lost all interest of engaging in discussion with those sorts of people which is why I said what I said in this video, to scare them away. See, I don't really care about up or downvotes... I care about testing and making this game better and I have no time discussing whether or not artillery should be in the game because it's a forgone conclusion... it's like discussing whether water should be wet or not. We have no power over it because Obsidian already invested a hefty chunk of money into developing artillery...  and hey, the people I spoke of can always prove me wrong by jumping ship when the game comes out :P Actually I solemnly swear that any WoT player who has more than 10000 battles, above 50% winrate and thinks artillery is cancer, who manages to play 10000 games of AW after it goes into open beta can message me and I will send them 20€ worth of AW currency and will publically aknowledge that I was wrong. I will make a video of me licking my own tears off of a boot which will be the hypothetical boots of all those I have wronged, showing my humility.  That's how sure I am that they will just go back to WoT and never be heard from again. Why do I know this? because it was the same with War Thunder...  but whatever, my opinion about this hasn't changed, I wanted to talk about the Swingfire and ATGMs in general, a bunch of people chose not to do that.. don't really care what people get offended about."

So I will continue to be hopeful that Obsidian will make any change that is needed to improve the game and not just dismiss a large portion of balance in the game.

People can have differing viewpoints, and one of the ways that people deal with this is by having a civilised discussion sing facts to support their opinions. Video OP failed to do this and instead called for the censoring of WoT & WT vet's opinions. The best part was ""They are not going to be your audience.

This does not include your average WoT player.   How do you define the average WoT player? If you define average by number of battles, the average WoT player has ~10 battles, as most registered accounts stop playing before they reach 10 battles.  As /u/OtterTenet brought up, there are many different types of players in WoT, all with different motivations to play and opinions of how to improve the game. Attempting to paint the entire player base with a broad brush just leaves you with a deeply flawed picture of the motivations of people.  I have played over 10k games in WoT. According to your assumptions in the video, I should hate missiles. I don't hate missiles, and I think they add an interesting flavor to this game.   Instead of attempting to generalize people, maybe you should bring up better points than them. After all, if you opinion is better, shouldn't you be able to demonstrate why it is better?"

I don't deny that. Ok let me try to explain again, maybe slightly better than in the video:   What I wanted to say was that there is a group of people in the Armored Warfare testing, who are comprised of WoT veterans, usually a lot of games played and usually pretty good (i.e. 51%+), with a strong dislike for artillery and ATGM (they will probably use the term ""skycancer"" or something to that effect) for whatever reason and this group of people will push any discussion toward the topic of banning artillery. Personally, I don't believe any amount of discussing that topic will ever change anything.  That does obviously not include EVERY WoT player... I'm a WoT player who fits the battles/winrate bill and I also have a strong dislike for artillery in WoT, yet I don't behave or think that way and if you don't behave or think that way then I was not talking about you. Armored Warfare is a new game with a different dynamic and old biases from other games are useless and counter productive.  This is why I said offense is never given, it is taken. Maybe I didn't articulate it in the video as well as I could have but my point stands, these people exist, they are obnoxious, and I would rather not deal with them. I didn't think it sounded like I was condemning everyone who has ever touched WoT but maybe it did and in that case, sorry for the misunderstanding."

Worse, you bunched up the people who don't mind AW having it's own voice, and who are very much in support of it, and have quit WoT for a long list of reasons each one significantly severe enough to dislike the game - and reduced them to ""Artillery/ATGM haters"".

You can usually spot them by their ""I'm such a badass unicum"" signatures :P  The second category you quite obviously didn't understand. I count myself into that category. People who are aware of how WoT works and how things are done in that game by the developer that runs it and in some way dislike it and have left the game either before or after they learned about Armored Warfare.

The one where all the terrible players that constantly complained about wot jumped ship over here and magically think they'll be better, because clearly it's wot mechanics that caused them to fail, and not their ability to actually play a very similar game?

ArmoredWarfare,3adl3e,smokyexe,2,Fri Jun 19 14:10:07 2015 UTC,I hope so. It's as obnoxious as the reload exploit was (and still is on certain tanks). It completely ruins hull down and you can tell they're doing it instantly by getting your gun/breach broken every shot.

ArmoredWarfare,3a6fbe,Jalaven,5,Thu Jun 18 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of a 'one a day' 2x XP modifier, it's probably the best option. People can choose to when to apply it, including their first win (or loss even) or hold out to 2x maximize what they feel is their best game of the day. It appeals to all sorts of people.  Alternatively, I'd love to suggest simply a fixed reward system that does away with the 2X thing in favour of simply offering X quantity of XP. You could make it first win or first game (though both could lead to the shitty gameplay everyone gripes about) ... Personally I like first win, it's a nice simple mechanic that at least encourages people to work in the common good while not penalizing bad players. The ""daily XP"" is an incentive to get people to play so it really needs to apply to everyone.  This option means no bad games, no fail teams affecting your daily reward. Just the ~50% chance to win. Sure, you might not get the sweet awesome game dailies, but they're probably fewer and further between than bad dailies."
ArmoredWarfare,3a6fbe,el_torico,3,Wed Jun 17 18:18:17 2015 UTC,This would be a smart move IMO. Yet another quality of life feature that WoT lacks that can help AW get the 1up.

I've had more than a few folks claim I'm using it with the Leo 1 since it has a really fast reload to begin with. Same with the LAV-300. As soon as the reload gets below about 6 seconds people immediately start crying that you're exploiting. I personally had a guy in a Chieftan accuse me of using it immediately after he hit me three times inside of 7 seconds and I managed to put two shots into him in return.   Anything to get an advantage and at the same time they can use it as ammo when they get out played. Why wouldn't a shitlord player want to use such a great ""feature""?"

ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,PantsSir,0,Mon Jun 22 03:49:10 2015 UTC,"You are supposed to do everything to win.  Whether that makes the game broken or boring is a separate discussion, a game-design / balancing issue.  Not doing so makes you a ""scrub"" - a person that invents his own rules instead of following those built into the game.  ""Scrubs"" have the hubris to tell others how the game should be played, to try to stifle the natural competitive evolution.   Something is seen as powerful -> Everyone Uses it -> Someone figures out a counter tactic -> Everyone learns the tactic and it starts beating the previous one -> Someone figures out a counter to the counter -> etc etc.  So THIS TIME the problem is significant and game-altering (every non-autocannon gets 50% DPM boost). This time the fix is obvious.  However the attitude of the ""Exploiter"" is still purer and more natural than that of the ""Scrub"".   The ""Exploiter"" learned how to play in the new environment, and when it changes, the remnants of those skills will help them to adapt again.  Meanwhile the ""Scrub"" finds a new ""exploit"" to complain about.  List of ""Scrub"" excuses I have heard in WoT:  - Reverse angling is unfair  - Blind firing is unfair  - Bush-Camo techniques are unfair  - Platooning is unfair  - Premium Ammo is unfair  - UI improvement mods are unfair  Analyze all these examples, and it's evident that all of them are part of the game at some point, and need to simply be used as necessary to win.   Even the most controversial example - Premium Ammo (bought for regular credits). Does it make the game worse for everyone? Arguably, yes. Should it have been balanced ages ago? Yes. Is Wargaming exploiting it to sell credit packs? Yes. Is it an unfair exploit? Not really. Accessing it is easy enough now that it cannot be called unfair or exploitative. It's part of the game."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,OtterTenet,3,Thu Jun 18 13:16:11 2015 UTC,"Begins to formulate a response and then notices username.   I love how the word scrub keeps evolving and taking on new meanings at the drop of a hat lol. I personally don't care about it, I choose not to use it and do just fine in game was my point. It's a bug and will be fixed. No one is ""Ok"" with it remaining as is was my point.   I'd say the scrubs are the ones who use the exploit and then when they still lose accuse others of the same exploit they just blatantly abused while losing if anything. I think anyone who openly bitches and calls others names in a video game is a sad piece of shit who really needs to get a life. Sure, tomatoes exist but spewing more toxic shit around doesn't really help anyone but some folks like to vent so more power to them.  Maybe my inability to be an unabashed dickwad every day is why I never bothered to try harder than low blue play in wot."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,HandBanaba,0,Thu Jun 18 15:40:10 2015 UTC,"You have a problem with my username? Feel free to message me your concerns in private.   The word Scrub may be evolving in your mind, but in mine it stayed fixed ever since I read it in Sirlin's Play to Win Article.  http://sirlingames.squarespace.com/articles/playing-to-win-part-1.html It comes from the Street Fighter competitive scene, and used to identify an intentionally non-competitive player who attempts to impose rules on others. ""ie: Throws are Unfair, stop using throws!""   The only exception is when: A) Something is widely accepted as completely game breaking. B) That ""Something"" is easy to police / ban.   Condition A is generally controlled by Developers in Alpha, and Competition holders / Competitive Community during open-beta/release.  Condition B determines whether anyone should keep playing the game. Problems that completely eliminate the ability to play competitively and are impossible to police mean ""the winning move is not to play"".   A ""scrub"" claim usually fails both checks - it tries to restrict something that is impossible to restrict in the first place, because it's built into the game, and it makes premature unfounded determinations about it's impact on competitive play.  Giving everyone 50% faster reload doesn't necessarily mean the game is unplayable.  It just means some of the balance is different. It's no different in that sense from other significant problems like Swingfire's view range, or MBT armor holes.   The whole culture of calling built-in features as ""bugs"" is unhealthy. Developers don't need that coddling. They are human, they make mistakes. It's ok to admit when mistakes happen. Just balance it with reminders of how awesome AW is developing so far and how much we appreciate the information provided about design decisions."

It's a poorly designed game mechanic that creates a poor balance and negative gameplay experience.  There is nothing wrong with a player doing everything in his power to play well as long as he's not breaking the rules of the game via hacking, glitching, or manipulating some kind of bug or exploit.  Hell, I haven't even touched a MBT this EA so I can't use the ammo swap skill and I have no problem with others using it.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying it was a good thing or should be included in the game.  Like I wrote earlier, it's a poorly designed skill that has negative gameplay impact.  I'm happy they're fixing it or removing it or whatever.  It's just really disingenuous to call someone a cheater or exploiter when they're simply using the tools that the developers gave them."

ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,VoteRonaldRayGun,3,Thu Jun 18 09:29:35 2015 UTC,"The actual ""exploit"" is using different commander/crew skills to stack up both Reload and Reload on Ammo-Swap bonuses. The bonuses work Exactly as stated in descriptions, and stack. Abilities that boost reload on swap: 19%+19% on swap + 9% bonus ability = ~ %47 reload boost when swapping between ammo. Any ammo, including downgrades. This is most effective on Light Tanks and TD's, that already have very high Damage Per Minute.  Please show proof that it's a bug. Don't claim a bug without detailed proof about what exactly went wrong. All evidence points to a case of developers not realizing how abilities will stack. The only real way to fix this is to replace those abilities completely - otherwise they will be useless traps for rookies just like in WoT.  This is an ""Exploit"" just like every other ""Exploit"" in the game this patch:   Leopard 2AV / 2 turret armor being broken and easy to penetrate. Chieftan and other tanks being significantly underpowered Light Tank bonus being too good, and Light Tanks dominating the game.  TD Fire Control being too good and making them almost as useful on the move as Light Tanks.  Swingfire view range being too high (over 600m when stationary) Autocanon HE shells doing internal damage to High Armor targets / MBT's (utterly unrealistic, they should at most be capable of damaging external modules / reactive armor). The solution there is to add a ""minimum damage block"" stat to each armor value - the higher the value, the higher the minimum damage packet required to reduce the HP bar.     All of these ""exploits"" are being ""abused"" and it's fine because it's Early Access.  In fact, it's a good testing practice because it shows the developers what will happen in competitive environments, when the game goes live. Can the game remain fun when everyone has 50% more reload and DPM?  Can the game remain fun when MBT's are underpowered, along with some of the high tier AFV's?"
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,OtterTenet,2,Thu Jun 18 13:01:21 2015 UTC,"I was trying to be deliberately vague rather than continue spreading it.   The devs have already said they're going to fix it and that it was a mistake, all they need to do is  1) Prevent it stacking  2) Something else (remove bonus if reload hasn't finished etc).  It is 100% absolutely and solid and undeniable exploit due to a mistake on the developer's part.   My other comments mentioned more important issues such as the armor bugs in the Leopard and mild balance issues (most are caused by the lack of a proper tech tree and match maker).   The reload exploit is only used by a minority of people is the problem, a minority are significantly advantaged due to an exploit which is pretty damn scummy. It doesn't matter if I called it a bug, people know what I meant, I'm tired.  Hopefully testing and get to work fixing balance rather than silly exploits."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,VoteRonaldRayGun,4,Thu Jun 18 13:18:28 2015 UTC,"You don't need to be deliberately vague. This is not a released game, it's in testing and information should be spread freely so the most people can provide the most accurate feedback.   How about the armor on the Leopard 2 or 2AV turret?  Should people stop shooting it?  Because that's ""100% an absolutely and solid and undeniable exploit due to a mistake on the developer's part"".  So is the Swingfire View Range. 500m+ the AFV bonus is undeniable an exploit.  So is the view range on most Tank Destroyers.  Words like ""scummy"" and ""mild balance issues"" are just your way to replace arguments with emotions.  What's the logical backing to claiming 600+m view range is ""mild""?!  ""Early Access"" is marketing nonsense. We're still in alpha and finding bugs to exploit, and exploiting them fully as much as we can, is the only way to provide developers accurate statistics on changes.   This idea of the community picking and choosing what is ""proper"" and what is ""scummy"" at this stage of development is beyond ridiculous. It can actually hurt the game."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,OtterTenet,2,Thu Jun 18 14:21:53 2015 UTC,"What? You're comparing something that just happens and cannot be helped (shooting an enemy) with something which requires a specific set of deliberate actions.  Either discuss the exploit or not, there are other threads as you know about the balance problems and armor bugs.  Exploiting it is still a bad thing to do. All this causes is to turn people away from the game. Exploiting prevents the developer from balancing the game because they cannot see what's over/underpowered or what is just bug exploitation. Just shooting a bugged tank or playing the Swingfire is just not comparable. Those are balance, not exploit issues."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,VoteRonaldRayGun,3,Thu Jun 18 14:55:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Discouraging exploiting in any way in Alpha/Beta sends the wrong message. Leaves a chance of people choosing to hide advantages to themselves.  Reward people for discovering exploits, and encourage them to be used to the max to see how the gameplay is affected.   This is why we have Alpha, to get the worst exploits and imbalances revealed before Open release.   Just shooting a bugged tank, knowing you shouldn't pen, instead of flanking it is a deliberate action - abuse of developer intentions.  Just using a fast tank with 600+ view range alters the entire game in ways the developers never intended.   They are all competitive decisions that are unfair to people trying to test less powerful tanks or play the game as they think it was ""intended"".   There is no such moral high ground in Alpha testing / Early Access, and the example you are setting is very bad for rookie players. Instead of learning to adapt and grab at every advantage, they start doubting themselves and building up illogical decisions."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,OtterTenet,2,Thu Jun 18 20:42:33 2015 UTC,"Find problem, abuse it a few times to check it out, report problem, stop causing more of the problem.  I and plenty of players used the exploit, but I tend to have standards and don't want to cheat new players out of enjoying the game because I want to increase my imaginary wipe-able K/D."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:03:56 2015 UTC,"No.  It's a balance issue.  The skill is working as intended, the developers just didn't foresee the actual in game effect it would have.  You're imbuing a simply poorly though out mechanic with some kind evil or morally reprehensible characteristic and that's just not that case."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,FrankyMcShanky,2,Fri Jun 19 05:40:53 2015 UTC,"The developers have literally said in their owns words it is going to be removed. It is wrong to do something which gives you an unfair advantage over other players.You are turning away new players and making the community look bad is what I am saying.  This isn't a fun little trick like skiing in Tribes, it's abuse of a temporary developer mistake."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:18:59 2015 UTC,I feel like they wouldn't need to totally replace those abilities.  Simply putting in an internal cooldown of 5-10 seconds would prevent the current crisis.

The question is, how exactly will they fix it."

Only ever done it twice though.  I don't make a fuss about it but I've never been okay with the reload exploit and Alpha, Beta or fully released anybody knowingly using it repeatedly on purpose is 100% pathetic and to me, they obviously feel inadequately skilled at the game to play without it. Guess they're also the type to use aimbots in CS though so eh what can you do. Fairness is an abstract notion to them, complaining seems pointless to me."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,Alazais86,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:58:54 2015 UTC,Shooting a gun barrel itself might not be. If you shoot into the turret where the gun is connected you will pen 100% of the time.

ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,TheAylius,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"The desire to attain high tier vehicles and do well in these competitive armored vehicle games runs pretty high, we can already see this involved in in game chats and discussion boards. When an exploit or ""cheat"" gets in the way of someone's potential progression then it becomes a problem. Most people are going to take the road where they can exploit it and gain more XP and performance by just pressing a few buttons. Another poignant question is, what is an actual downside to doing it? Any ideas? Aside from the torrent of rage, and tear jerking hackusations there is no reason not to use the exploit. It doesn't hurt you by doing it, it only exponentially increases your damage output. People defend it partially because they want their exploit to work in favor of them, and partially because if they don't then the people that DO use the exploit will walk over them like it's near nothing. This whole phase of debate is near over though because the glitch is being patched soon, and it will all be behind us. However it did open up a rift in the playerbase on the reddit and in game.   Do I condone the use of this exploit? No, I we one of the first to report it and personally brought every mod I saw attention to it to make sure It was fixed ASAP. Personally I'm not going to lie I do use it, usually when the pressure is on and I have to clutch, but not that I can't do well without it, but that if I don't use it I'm 99% of the time going to get the shit Merced out of me by the guys who DO. So, on one side I could get Merced repeatedly and die just to say I'm not an ""exploiter"", or I could use it and be on the same playing field as my opposite stingray and Leo2/T80 drivers."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,Gabost8,0,Thu Jun 18 02:21:39 2015 UTC,"What is so wrong with it? There is no real progression since the server will be wiped and none of the paid benefits are active. I don't think they are banning exploiters just yet, so that might be why everyone is so open about it. Also I think people don't see exploits the same as cheating mods, they just see it as part of the game, specially now since it's really incomplete.  If you are worried that the community is going to end up being a bunch of cheaters, I don't think you should worry. These exploits will undoubtedly be fixed. Some of them are apparently fixed."

ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,Norvax_,2,Thu Jun 18 08:28:06 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simply really, the more people use a bug the more people talk about the bug, the more chance there is the devs hear of the bug. It's beta / alpha / earlywhatever. Progression here means nothing, winning or losing means nothing. Finding bugs and making sure the devs know about them means everything.  Personally I don't use bug's very often, but I also don't have any issue with people using bugs to get the devs attention, or even to have a bit of silly fun while they're at it.  I've played beta's / alphas before where devs have openly said they don't mind people messing around with bugs in beta phases because of the reasons I stated. Maybe Armoured Warfare devs have different opinions, either way, they're finding out about the bugs in the game."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,drogoran,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:40:17 2015 UTC,or instead of everyone using a bug to get the devs atention it would be sufficient for 1 person to write a bug report in the apropriate section  and then stop using the bug  there is no excuse anyone can make about why they should keep using bugs that hold upp to logic and common sence  it all boils down to people wanting the upper hand and that they are willing to do whatever they feel is safe to get it

Once it's full release now that's a completely different thing, I have no tolerance of bug abuse then. The point I was trying to make was aimed at bugs that haven't been recognized by the devs yet, it gives them exposure. Once they're publicly recognized by devs then sure, there isn't really any reason to carry on using bugs/exploits."
ArmoredWarfare,3a8eva,OtterTenet,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:44:20 2015 UTC,"Exploiting the bug is a net-gain for the community, because your idealistic scenario never works.  Step 1. Announce that exploiters will be punished.  Step 2. Find Bug  Step 3. Replicate Bug  Step 4. Hoard bug for huge advantage at Open Beta.  or Step 4. Abuse bug sparingly in key moments to avoid detection.   A huge chunk of the population will behave as the above if finding exploits is punished instead of rewarded.   This method is much better:  Step 1: Announce rewards for finding bugs.  Step 2: Find Bug, Replicate, Report  Step 3: Use bug freely until it's hotfixed.  Step 4: Developers get experience with how fast bugs propagate, how fast population responds to metagame shifts, how vulnerable people feel towards rapid changes.   Step 5: Developers get experience releasing rapid hot-fixes so such cases go even smoother when the game goes Open.   This is what Early Access is all about - Freedom of information and action within the rules of the game.   Breaking the game in Alpha = Saving the game on Release."

The Sheridan turret ""t49"" is not actually a t49, but merely another prototype based on the bulldog chassis. It existed to test the turret and gun. It was not really a tank prototype and the only reason you have ever heard of it is that it was not made of aluminum, and qualifies for WoT."
ArmoredWarfare,3a165s,RickR13,-1,Wed Jun 17 01:49:34 2015 UTC,Really surprising to see a tank model designed closer to WW2 than the Cold War
ArmoredWarfare,3a165s,Hotblack_Desiato_,2,Tue Jun 16 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"Wut?  It was designed in the fifties.  Hell, the Pattons are just elaborations of the Pershing, which was a (late) ww2 model.  I'll bet we'll see a T-54 at some point, and they started working on that in 1944.  Plenty of WWII hardware was used well into the cold war, and stayed reasonably relevant."
ArmoredWarfare,3a165s,Sisaroth,-5,Tue Jun 16 14:30:19 2015 UTC,"Looks a lot less sexier then the WoT version, but still nice :). I hope there will still a lot of improvements in the model and texture quality of the tanks."

ArmoredWarfare,3a2fkp,Terrachova,4,Sun Jun 21 09:24:27 2015 UTC,"This is the way it is for all tanks that have ATGMs, as a balance mechanic.  I personally don't like it either, but such is how it is."
ArmoredWarfare,3a2fkp,tzeentch_,3,Tue Jun 16 18:46:50 2015 UTC,"It makes total sense for tanks that have gun-launched ATGMs, like the Sheridan. It's necessary for the loader to extract and replace the round. I hope they'll include the gun-launched ATGM rounds carried by virtually all Warsaw Pact tanks late in the cold war, and they would definitely need a reload for balance reasons.  It makes no sense at all for vehicles with multiple weapon systems like the BMP-2, which are quite capable of firing these weapons one after the other, or even at the same time. That's just unnecessarily sacrificing realism for game balance. Let all the tubes fire at once and nerf the relevant vehicles some other way - how about the fact that they're thin-skinned vehicles carrying thousands of pounds of explosives, eh?  EDIT: I'm hoping they'll include a couple of tanks that have autocannons in addition to their normal tubes, as well. There's a Czech version of  the T72 with a co-ax autocannon, and some variants of the AMX30 and M60 mounted small turrets on top of their main turrets with autocannons. There's more as well. It would be awful if there were a swap delay for these."
ArmoredWarfare,3a2fkp,Sisaroth,2,Tue Jun 16 20:05:32 2015 UTC,And the BMPs seem quite underpowered atm so it might work out fine. It would also increase the skill ceiling because shooting rockets and an autocannon at the same time is probably harder than doing one thing at a time.
ArmoredWarfare,3a2fkp,tzeentch_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:27:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Real ATGMs can be guided by a bewildering variety of guidance systems, but almost all of them require extremely careful control by a human operator from the launching vehicle (or tripod). I'd like to see it technically possible to fire both at once, but inadvisable since the autocannon hammering away would screw up your guidance - and since the autocannon has ballistics, while most ATGM guidance requires pointing directly at the target with no compensation for drop. In effect, I'd like the good IFVs to be able to accurately shoot both weapons one after the other with little to no pause.  IFVs able to hose MBTs from the front with HE while they wait for the missile reload would be nice."
ArmoredWarfare,3a2fkp,Terrachova,2,Wed Jun 17 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"Guys, I'm not saying I agree with the decision.  I'm saying thats how it is done ingame, currently.  I think it only makes sense for barrel-launghed ATGMs like with the Sheridan and whatnot.  I've been saying since the first weekend test that having to load a fresh missile every time you switch with tanks like the BMP-2 is silly.  So, y'know, no need to preach to me about that bit of ridiculousness, heh."
ArmoredWarfare,3a2fkp,atriax,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"You do realize how stupidly OP tanks would be if they could fire their cannon, and a fucking missile immediately after? It'd be like the stingray/LAV. Lol"

ArmoredWarfare,3a2fkp,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:06:55 2015 UTC,"Unnecessarily sacrificing realism for game balance. If it was necessary, I'd be 100% for it. But there's so many ways you can balance the autocannon + ATGM vehicles, other than this."
ArmoredWarfare,3a2fkp,K1ttykat,2,Tue Jun 16 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"A delay is ok, an ""arming sequence"" or something. But 15 seconds to switch to my ATGM is dire. I never use the auto cannon now because the delay penalties for switching make it pointless. I just camp at the back and snipe with missiles instead of being a versatile brawling scout."
ArmoredWarfare,3a2fkp,Beaverkilla,2,Tue Jun 16 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"Ultimately it's a more arcade focused game and NOT a simulation, There has to be balance between the tanks and the weapons they use.  What you want is to unload an autocannon, switch to a 100mm cannon fire that and then switch to an ATGM and fire that and this is not reasonable in any way whatsoever to expect to unload 3 guns in a row with no penalty to switching between them."

ArmoredWarfare,3a3vut,atriax,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"MBTs need reactive armor earlier in the game, or push ATGMs to a high tier."
ArmoredWarfare,3a3vut,VoteRonaldRayGun,2,Wed Jun 17 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"That is how it was historically. MBTs relied on heavy steel armor and the ATGM was designed to make them obsolete. At the time, many thought it was the end of the tank as we know it.  Obviously this is not real life and there needs to be balance but I'd rather have them tweak the damage, reload and ammunition count or make early generation ATGMs more difficult to control than introduce ERA on vehicles that did not have it."
ArmoredWarfare,3a3vut,Konsalik,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:13:23 2015 UTC,ATGMs are already pushed back quite a bit. For example BMP-1 and AMX-10P should have Malutka or Milan .  In one patch they doubled the ATGM speed vs real life. Before it was really hard to use ATGMs.
ArmoredWarfare,3a3vut,Stromovik,2,Sat Jun 20 19:48:26 2015 UTC,The later tier tanks have atgm counter meassures. They counter up to 4 atgm's and the tanks have better reactive armor. Atm the swingfire fotm thats why you see so many rockets

ArmoredWarfare,3a3vut,WCsharpeh,2,Wed Jun 17 02:41:55 2015 UTC,The issue is the passiveness that is required as a result of the combination indirect fire making MBTs kind of worthless.  WoT is similarly boring because it takes a number of shots to kill something which makes mobility/indirect fire more important than a lot of health and armor.  In a game like warthunder mobility isn't as strong since all it takes is one good shot to kill someone.
ArmoredWarfare,3a3vut,Stromovik,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:55:55 2015 UTC,"To me the problem seems to be horrid accuracy on the move for MBTs , I played T-62 and T-64 and you stop and aim for a few seconds before firing , while these tanks have 2 plane gun stabilization."
ArmoredWarfare,3a3vut,WCsharpeh,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:52:05 2015 UTC,even if they were laser accurate the overall slowness of MBTs would still be a detriment to faster tanks. Scouts and the like just fire fast enough that they can fire on the move.
ArmoredWarfare,3a3tkv,atriax,3,Wed Jun 17 00:35:17 2015 UTC,MBT's should have way more advanced modifiers if they want to be placed on the same plane of balance of the other tanks.
ArmoredWarfare,3a3tkv,TheAylius,3,Wed Jun 17 00:43:04 2015 UTC,MBT's got an extra bonus of slow-ness.
ArmoredWarfare,3a3tkv,imaginary_num6er,2,Wed Jun 17 05:42:15 2015 UTC,"Because ideally, strong armor would be quite tough to break. When MM is pitting T62s against Stingray 2s, LAV-600s, etc, that obviously falls apart. Even within tier, though, armor could use some improvement."
ArmoredWarfare,3a3tkv,Siriothrax,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:55:19 2015 UTC,"That's not the point. Strong armor is something that comes naturally on the tank. It's not an added bonus. TDs/Lights literally get an extra added bonus. They don't have something like ""farther view range"" which is already on the tank. They get ""no aim dispersion while moving forward and backwards"" and ""Extra damage while fully aimed."" Those are completely extra and have nothing to do with the integral parts of the tank. Why do MBT's get fucked so hard?"
ArmoredWarfare,3a3tkv,Sisaroth,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:04:56 2015 UTC,"Imo they should remove all class modifiers and fine tune each tank individually. It doesn't make sense that LTs with bigger guns than MBTs have better gun handling.  Sure, dividing the tanks in different classes then makes less sense but whatever.   The balance issues with the game are getting so big that I don't enjoy it anymore already. Waiting for a balance patch."
ArmoredWarfare,3a3tkv,WCsharpeh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:29:33 2015 UTC,You could probably just give them faster repairs/strengthened modules.
ArmoredWarfare,3a3tkv,Not_F1zzzy90908,0,Wed Jun 17 12:06:53 2015 UTC,Light tanks are the single most overpowered piece of player equipment I have ever seen in a game. Ever see a Stingray that was scared of an MBT? NOPE. Why would you? It has more hit points. Better penetration. It's faster. It deals more damage. And it has twice as fast a reload as the MBT. It can kill a T-72 before the T-72 can effectively put 2 shots into it. They REALLY need to be rebalanced.
ArmoredWarfare,3a3tkv,TheAylius,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"The T72 is a tier 5, and doesn't have access to any retrofit equipment. Also the module tiering hasn't been implemented. A maxed out stingray will more often than not see higher tier matches when it's implemented, and on top of that the reload exploit is being fixed in an upcoming hot patch."

Be aware that the Swingfire can still light you at ~550m when stationary. If the enemy list contains them, don't try to passive-scout.    Fully Upgraded Guide: Shoot Stuff with APCR, watch it explode.  Remember that you have an engine. If played right, you should ALWAYS be among the last tanks to die when losing.  You should always be within fighting range of enemies when winning. Make that Engine work.   The wheeled motion can be tricky, and the gun depression is sub-par, so you are often exposed significantly when shooting. This is why it's important to keep track of enemy Swingfire / Scout locations and be ready to run. Planning an exit strategy from every position you reach is key. Waiting until you get lit is often suicide.  You don't want to ever get boxed in and lose that huge relocation advantage."

The high RoF allows it to lob HEP rounds on tier 7 tanks and still deal consistent damage.  Sheridans on the other hand, feel like a bag of crap with the poor accuracy, view range, and camo. 12+ sec reload? You got to be kidding me when the LAV-300 on full focus deals more damage in less than 4.5s."

If a newbie scrub gets a stupidly high win rate and K/D ratio in a tank, then I'll take notice and check if it's balanced. If they're then performing poorly in other tanks, you know that the one machine they're doing well in is OP."

And yet if the average good player gets 2 kills per game in one tank and the average good player gets 5 kills per game in another tank of the same class (while noob players average at 0.75 kills, for example), the second tank is clearly the more powerful option. You have to look both at how the good players perform with the tank (the optimal ""ceiling"" of power) and how the average and bad players perform (the ""floor"" of power) to see whether something is balanced. Just because a good player can avoid dying and get a few shots off in an underpowered vehicle doesn't mean the vehicle isn't underpowered if they can do significantly more in other similar vehicles."

Right now, its just since armor is abit iffy, you can just look at bonuses and hard stats for TDs and LTs.  More pen, more Alpha, about the same HP at some tiers and a faster reload togeather with better camo and viewrange. LTs not having any fears going face to face with MBTs in game shows it.  Its not a complain, just how it is now in the test. I still find it fun to drive MBTs for awhile. And things will change."

I'm saying if you want to judge how balanced a vehicle is, you need to look at players from across the skill range. Don't just focus on how well the pros are doing in a vehicle because that messes with the numbers.   The LAV 300 and Stingray probably are OP. I was just talking about vehicle balancing in general.

If you could grind through the Swingfire id say go get the VBL of the bat outta hell gameplay appeals to you.   But out of the two you mentioned I only own the LAV with about 10 games in it so far. It's fun and does a lot of damage; you just have to be sure to be a back line player much like WoT TDs however you're faster (85 km/hr). Thankfully want to get a tier 5 1,900,000 isnt too much to grind it all"

ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,CirnoNewsNetwork,4,Mon Jun 15 04:41:22 2015 UTC,"Going from tier 4 to 5 feels like the longest grind which I have ever had the displeasure to endure. The T-64 is manageable, but the Leopard 1 is just awful. I can't seem to play that tank correctly. However, the high ""xp"" costs are justified in my opinion by the fact that if a tank splits into two different paths, you instantly have the ability to purchase both vehicles when you have finished researching the vehicle. Like how the T-64 splits in to the T-72 and the Chieftain."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,Not_F1zzzy90908,2,Mon Jun 15 04:44:38 2015 UTC,I really liked that too. I thought I was going to have to grind xp on the 64 again but instead I just bought both the Shitstain mk.5 and the T72.
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,atriax,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"One thing I'd like to mention about the grind from 4-5. A lot of folks may not realize it but 4-5 is closer to tier 5-7 in WoT Terms. Since the tech trees only go to tier 8 from what the devs are saying you end up having 2 whole tiers that are compressed and redistributed between the currently planned 8 tiers.   And of course, we have zero premium features right now as well so expect close to 10-25% better income for Creds and XP for a prem account and add on a premium tank on top of that and I think the grind will be maybe too easy. It's about making money, not F2P players since they don't directly contribute to keeping the server and dev time paid for. So they have to strike a balance and the game already feels like it's in a sweet spot for that IMO.   You are 110% right about the tree-splitting feature though. Not having to re-grind the XP when a tree splits is probably the best feature EVER.. But that may not stay, I hope it does but it may allow people who are f2p to progress too fast which in turn may cause people to get into high tiers too quickly, which can lead to mass-burnout. I do not envy the devs for having to balance these two extremes as it's a damn fine line they must walk to both reward enough but give enough incentive for people to plop money down."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,HandBanaba,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:33:19 2015 UTC,"I think 4-5 is just like 6-7, nothing crazy.  I think they just skipped the whole WOT tier 1-2 scene because nobody really plays them except some seal clubbers and real starters."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,CDXVI,0,Tue Jun 16 13:27:32 2015 UTC,"I'm disagreeing with your assessment of the Leopard 1, it's a difficult tank to play but not a weak one. It's just not a classic MBT and can't be played like one.   The 4 to 5 feels acceptable, but the problem is that it keeps accelerating. I doubt I will find 5 to 6, or 6 to 7 acceptable."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,OtterTenet,2,Mon Jun 15 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"the Leopard 1 and AMX-30's should probably be split away from the ""main"" tree of the arms-dealers, they are simply too different for a newbie to pick up and feel comfortable in, both sacrifice protection almost entirely in favor of mobility, but if you want to exploit said mobility you need to know the map fairly well to begin with, getting the Leopard 1 as your first tier 4 tank would be painful to put it politely.  both tanks excelled because they had 1st rate fire control systems and a internal layout that allowed them to put 2-3 times the volume of fire down range of a equivalent soviet design while having a enormous mobility advantage, but the game's design with fairly confined maps means it's hard to exploit the mobility advantage and doubling the DPM (or halving the T-55/T-62's DPM rather) is simply put out of the question."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,Draken84,3,Tue Jun 16 10:39:24 2015 UTC,"I think the grind is fine right now. I don't really want everybody to get to max tier in a single week. Because right now we've not even had that many hours of playtime and there are loads of tier 6 tanks even.  As long as the tanks are fun in the middle tiers then it should be enjoyable enough to get to the end in a month or so. I dunno, I guess it's all a matter of perspective."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,Alazais86,5,Mon Jun 15 11:37:05 2015 UTC,"I don't like the ""Do X amount of dmg from longer then 300 meters"". Nor do i like to be forced in to one specific tank to get the next in line.  But i suppose that can be fixed with Free XP ?"
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,Clogman,3,Mon Jun 15 05:34:04 2015 UTC,"I think the > be forced in to one specific tank to get the next in line. will be less of an issue as they add more tanks to the trees. We are only seeing a small example of the tanks and dealers that are planned to be in the game at this point and that makes it feel like the grinding is all the more boring. If you've not tried the grind from the T-64 to the t-72/Chief then you may not have realized it yet but when playing the T-64 you are actually unlocking both tanks simultaneously, not one at a time like you do in the other two tank games on the market. Meaning you are effectively getting a two for one grind there. I can see this being a huge boon if they strategically place these split points in the trees when more tanks have been added as it's a feature that the other games simply do not have.   The > ""Do X amount of dmg from longer then 300 meters"" missions are cool IMO as well. I can see where what you said is frustrating as I experienced it as well. It forces a support play style and that can be bad for a lot of players who don't like that sort of thing. Realistically if you perform well with Wolfi's tanks or simply buy the arty it becomes pretty a pretty short grind. After I realized I wanted the LAV-300 I changed my playstyle and how I used the Leo 1 and honestly, it made me a better player of that tank. I was then able to grind out the damage needed long before I was able to grind out the 1.9M credits it needed. Also, it's awesome that arty counts towards this as well! I averaged abit over 1100 damage per game in the Gro..gvo..gru...the fucking SPG in that line! That makes it roughly ~40-45 games in the arty to unlock it. Of course sometimes you have to shotgun tanks in the face so this number is very generalized but it takes a similar number of games to progress from tier 3-4."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,HandBanaba,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yes i agree with what you are saying. i'm actually doing the T-64 grind atm for the T-72 so i can relate to what you say easily. About the LAV-300 which i wanted, was annoying to get cause the >300m forces you to camp or play arty, neither is fun. Also when you get the LAV-300, the only thing you can use the XP from it, are the next TD in the line.  I just wished the XP made from the LAV-300 could be used on other trees.. but i suppose i cant get everything."

It's more than just bad for players who don't like that sort of play, it's also bad for players who want to unlock that type of vehicle ASAP. The tier 1 and 2 tanks in that dealer are pretty unsuited for 300m sniping (given that they have autocannons), and yet if you want to unlock the LAV-300 as soon as you can a lot of people use the autocannon tanks as snipers to get as much progress towards it as possible.  Essentially we need more low-tier variety if we want to have these sorts of set-in-stone missions for certain tank types. If there were a low-tier tank that was more suited to firing at range, people would take far less issue with how the missions are set up. As is, though, you only have one option at tier 1 and one option at tier 2 and they're both terrible for that specific mission. Just because the LAV-300 should frequently be used at long range doesn't mean it's good practice to pretend like a tank with an autocannon is a sniper."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,Zulunko,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:28:41 2015 UTC,"low tier variety is coming as has been shown with the M41 Walker bulldog post that was made just today, it's going to be a low-tier tank and I'll bet it'll be on the Wolfi tree if not a new tree. It's too early to suggest changing tier 5 stuff based on the current tier 1-2 stuff.   Also,  playing low tier 1-2 tanks incorrectly in hopes of unlocking a tier 5 TD more quickly is just silly. I mean if unlocking the Patton, which is pretty much a second line support tank anyway, takes more than 40 games then you really need to reconsider how badly you want to move up to a tier 5 tank since you've already demonstrated poor choices in playstyle and game mechanics comprehension.   Just because you may not like your job doesn't mean you tell your boss ""I don't like this type of work but I want my paycheck as quickly as possible so change the work to be more suited to me"". Sure this isn't a job and should be fun but at the same time, wanting to play a line of tanks outside of thier intended role just because you don't like the intended role doesn't mean that they should change the role to suit you. As it is now a decent player can unlock the LAV-300 in less than ~50 games in the Leo 1.   Since the LAV is a tier 5 I honestly think they should be locked it until you get the Leo 1 just to prevent people from getting it before they get the leo 1 since going from tier 2 to tier 5 instantly is generally a bad idea. The mechanic is sound as is the reasoning its there. It's plenty accessible and just because people want to rush to it without paying whats due for it doesn't mean it needs to be changed. At most they should maybe reduce the range requirement from 300 to like 225m-240m as the view range seems to be maxed at around 500M and most maps aren't big enough yet to really support extremely long range play.   This is just my opinion and while your opinion can't be ""wrong"" I definately do not agree with it. I've managed to get the LAV-300 unlocked in less than  3 hours of actually trying for it. I've been playing the T-64 line on the EU server and only just got the leo 1 on the NA server Sunday night and already have the LAV-300 on Tuesday. I'm not an amazing player and it wasn't the least bit hard to accomplish for me and I'm far better in the brawling role than playing support."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,HandBanaba,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:31:31 2015 UTC,"Also, playing low tier 1-2 tanks incorrectly in hopes of unlocking a tier 5 TD more quickly is just silly.   Obviously, but the game is telling you to do damage from >300 meters, not to get to tier 3 and then do damage from >300 meters.   Sure this isn't a job and should be fun but at the same time, wanting to play a line of tanks outside of thier intended role just because you don't like the intended role doesn't mean that they should change the role to suit you.   I never said this. I say that we should either have tanks of multiple roles (so we can play the way the missions are making us play to unlock the lines), the missions should restrict themselves to only tanks which would actually benefit from those playstyles, or the missions shouldn't force us to play a certain way to unlock the lines.   Since the LAV is a tier 5 I honestly think they should be locked it until you get the Leo 1 just to prevent people from getting it before they get the leo 1 since going from tier 2 to tier 5 instantly is generally a bad idea.

I don't think you should be able to jump from tier 2 to 5 instantly either, but the game is telling you ""play this way if you want to play these tanks"", not ""level up to tier 3 and then start playing this way"".

I'm not an amazing player and it wasn't the least bit hard to accomplish for me and I'm far better in the brawling role than playing support.   The point is that different players prefer different playstyles. You may prefer brawling, but I've always been a fan of moving quickly, avoiding getting hit entirely, and taking shots when the opponent doesn't expect it. It's why I went for the Leopard 1 in World of Tanks.  Let me ask you, where is the advantage in making me play autocannon tanks until tier 3 and then play MBTs and get damage from greater than 300 meters in order to unlock the actual long-range tanks? I agree with the amount of time the progression takes, I agree with the reasoning of ""you should practice and try out this role before you actually play it"", and I agree that the lower-tier tanks should not be used to hit targets at 300 meters. None of those are the issue here; the issue is that the game literally tells you to get 45k damage from greater than 300 meters to unlock X line of tanks irrespective of what class of tank you're trying to use to hit targets at greater than 300 meters.  Something as simple as saying ""you must hit targets at greater than 300 meters using a weapon other than an autocannon"" would solve my only issue with the current system. But if you think hitting people at greater than 300 meters with autocannons to unlock the wheeled TDs is dumb, then that implies the system should either stop you from making progress for that mission using autocannons or the system should give you tanks more suited to that playstyle when you're attempting to work for those tanks.  World of Tanks, despite all of the regrettable decisions made there, at least lets you play a TD at tier 2. It might take a year of playing to unlock your tier 10 TD, but at least you can play TDs to work on unlocking your TD. In this game right now you're stuck making no progress on that mission until tier 3 (which takes significantly longer than making tier 3 in WoT) or you're stuck playing your tank in a suboptimal manner to try to make progress on the mission. Regardless of whether this situation will be changed soon, right now in the current state of the game it's a flaw of the mission system. Given that this thread is about opinions on ""the grind"" (i.e. the current progression we have experience with), I think it's relevant to point out that the missions present a significant weakness to the progression while we don't have lower-tier tank variety."

It's simply not true that autocannons can't and shouldn't be used at 300+ meters. If bust fired they are plenty accurate to still do damage. You play these tanks for such a short amount of time to get from tier 1-3 that it's really a non-issue.    Let me ask you, where is the advantage in making me play autocannon tanks until tier 3 and then play MBTs and get damage from greater than 300 meters in order to unlock the actual long-range tanks?   The advantage is obvious really. You're playing an autocannon up close you will more often than not hold the fire button down and spam it til the magazine is empty. If you see this ""do damange from more than 300M away"" requirement for a tank you want and you get in a match and sit and spam your autocannon the same way you always do by holding the button down til it's empty or the target disappears then you're gonna have a bad time. It teaches you proper fire control if nothing else, Burst-firing an autocannon is very effective at range to compensate for the retical bloom.  It will also help new players learn about spotting mechanics and ammunition selection since AP will be much less effective at 300+ meters than HEI would be.  Or how about map awareness? It'll teach you to look for exploitable positions and pay attention to how close the enemy team is to you and your base, etc on the mini map. It also teaches you when you need to make a hasty retreat and relocate to a better position.   There is a whole host of reasons to use this playstyle to unlock a vehicle that needs to its it and starting players at an early stage learn that role is extremely important.   The LAV-90 is also a good point. It's in the game however a premium, it's proof enough that lower tier WTD's will be in the game since it's only tier 3 so I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the trees get a big overhaul anyway.   Let me add this on at the end here for clarity. I'm not saying you don't have some valid points and I'm not saying your opinion is wrong. I'm saying that by replying back and fourth in a civil debate is really enjoyable and I appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about this in an intelligent and reasonable manner.

It's simply not true that autocannons can't and shouldn't be used at 300+ meters. If bust fired they are plenty accurate to still do damage.   Sure, but the point still stands that consistently attempting to stay at 300+ meters range in order to complete this mission is probably not the best use of those tier 1 and 2 vehicles, given that they have decently high spotting range, good mobility, and can destroy targets quite quickly when hitting them from behind. While I can burst at a Patton from 300m+ range all day, unless he's pointing his back towards me, nearly every hit is only going to do 3 damage.   The advantage is obvious really. You're playing an autocannon up close you will more often than not hold the fire button down and spam it til the magazine is empty.

But I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) that all the wheeled tank destroyers you unlock via this method don't have autocannons, so teaching people how to use their autocannons effectively at range isn't exactly helpful when you're trying to unlock the wheeled TDs. It's a good skill to have, for sure, but it's only a good skill if you're actually going to use it.   Or how about map awareness? It'll teach you to look for exploitable positions and pay attention to how close the enemy team is to you and your base, etc on the mini map. It also teaches you when you need to make a hasty retreat and relocate to a better position.   This is true, but it would also be true in a vehicle more suited for 300m+ ranges. In fact, a vehicle which has the ability to shoot once for decent damage and then relocate before the enemy has time to react would match the gameplay of the wheeled destroyers a lot more than attempting the same playstyle with an autocannon.   There is a whole host of reasons to use this playstyle to unlock a vehicle that needs to its it and starting players at an early stage learn that role is extremely important.   And I agree on this point, but I don't think the specific tier 1 and 2 tanks we have right now have a place contributing to that mission. I'd love to see how it works a month or two from now with a few more lower-tier tanks, and I feel like I'll have no issue with it by that point. For someone who prefers to play the game like I do, though, it's the most annoying part of the current progression system.   Let me add this on at the end here for clarity.

As of right now there are several tanks/trees i won't even consider because i won't play tanks that i don't want/like, period, simple as that, and the current system(which is like wot/wows) FORCES you to play tanks you might not give a shit to progress"

After 1.35 on War thunder, killed all my interest in their progression system which is atrociously slow.  Remains to be seen what sort of progression Obsidian is going to implement. Stick with the World of tanks one or hop on War Thunder pre-1.35 system or post 1.35 system.  Edit  pre 1.35 system though would push Obsidian on making new trees maybe in the long run, to make players start from a fresh ""level 1"" tank instead of implementing new tanks in existing trees once people start hitting maximum level there.. So maybe it's not the best idea.  In the end, current system might be best for the game's future with the twist of War thunder's being able to research any vehicle you're able to research towards for, but they should def make unlocking some of the vehicles bit faster. Making it comparable to rate of WoT, you should be seeing top tier tanks in 2-3 days after release with the usage of premium tanks (2nd Maus on NA WoT after release. took me only around 3-4 days )"
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,W4lt3r89,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:48:27 2015 UTC,"to be fair AW already has some sort of ""WT"" system, where to open some trees you need to fulfill some quotas(i.e X amount of dmg >300mts for the recon vehicles iirc, X amount of battles to unlock SPG, etc). But still inadequate when you're already IN the tree or you haven't bought the 1st tank after unlocking the tree"

ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,G18AkimboPro,2,Mon Jun 15 09:30:47 2015 UTC,"The grind is the grind.  You can't get away from that; it's a fundamental component of the genre.  What makes grinds difficult is when the vehicles you are grinding through are pain incarnate; impotent, vulnerable, and just plain uncomfortable.  MOST vehicles in WoT are that way; you have to grind through a bunch of shitshows to get to the decent vehicles.  However, with AW so far, I've yet to come across a really terrible ride.  Just about everything has been relatively pleasant so far, and whenever I've gotten blown up in a vehicle, the words coming out of my mouth are ""well, that was dumb,"" rather than ""fuck this tank!""  Even if I am in an LAV-150 and get thrown in with a bunch of sixes and sevens, it just feels like a considerable challenge rather than a ""better break out the lube"" moment.  Even the vehicles I don't especially like have strengths that I appreciate.  Scorpion?  Don't like it.  But it's fast as greased hog shit and has some respectable alpha."

ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,MCRoadkill,3,Tue Jun 16 14:30:05 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a pretty good player in this game, having unlocked two tier 7s on Saturday. I always see people talking about the grind from tier 4 to 5 being terrible, but it really wasn't, at least for me. 5 to 6 wasn't even half bad. But 6 to 7? Holy shit, that took a toll on me. The damn TS channel became a support group to keep me from going completely insane. I blame that on the 2AV being terrible more than anything. I'm 30%+ through the Leopard 2 (which is actually kinda bad) which is over 135,000 XP, or the amount needed for a tier 7. So it's not that bad, unlike what everyone says.   What this system does is it rewards good players very handsomely, and leave the ones who do not so well behind. I average 2100 XP per game. That's not too bad."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,Gatortribe,2,Mon Jun 15 06:17:51 2015 UTC,"I agree, The grind isn't really bad at all until you get to tier 6-7. Anyone who says otherwise is going to be the same people in WoT who complain about not being able to make credits because they refuse to purchase them, or prem time, or a prem tank to grind credits on.   Complaining about a grind that is overall this easy in a free to play game that they have yet to let us touch a single premium feature is just silly and naive. Shit has to be monetized somehow and the game is not designed around or devoted to the 100% Free to play playerbase. It's designed around money being made to support the company so they can keep the servers up and pay the devs to do thier jobs.   I'll get a lot of hate for this prolly but I think the grind should be a bit more difficult personally.. like 10% more XP/credits needed maybe. But that all depends on what the premium model is like because right now at tier 4 I'm averaging 68K silver and a bit over 1000 XP per game with spikes of over 150K and over 2K XP. To ever make 100K credits in WoT without prem time or a prem tank is super-uni level play and lets me real, 99% of the people bitching about the slow grind aren't playing at that level."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,HandBanaba,2,Mon Jun 15 10:24:51 2015 UTC,"I really don't want to get into an argument but it's well known that you and your platoon mates, Autumn and I forget the other one, have been using the ammo switching reload glitch pretty hard in game. Now you guys have been pretty up front about it in general but you yourself have said to me that you only stopped using it once you reached tier 7.  Winning games doubles the XP you get so by exploiting the glitch it makes any comments you have on how good/bad the grind is kinda useless. You no doubt got to higher tiers faster by using the glitch. It also messes up the devs looking at how players progress as yours and others stats are distorted. More wins is probably a big reason your average XP is high, which brings me too.....  That it's hilariously painful for you to say how good a player you are. You could well be but with all the glitching who really knows."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,zoobrix,-3,Mon Jun 15 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly the Leopard 2AV has such poor alpha and slow reload (it's worse than the A3 for crying out loud) I felt justified. I almost quit playing the game all together because of that tank. Of course, I wouldn't do it if I tracked someone. That's just cruel. But when your armor counts for nothing and your gun handles like an M60 at tier 6, it gets very frustrating.   My platoon mates, aside from the few times I played with Autumn, never used it. In fact, my friend Gentlestraw got past the 2AV in only about 10 more games than me and he never abused it.   So, the only times I can justify it is when your tank is so bad it should be moved down a tier, or someone else is doing it to you. It takes a lot for me to not do it to T-80s because they pen you much more than you can pen them and almost have the mobility of a light tank. I don't do it though and have lost 80% of the battles with T-80s.   EDIT: And winning games DOES NOT double your XP. I've been on the losing team and still got more XP than anyone else numerous times. You get something measly like a 25% bonus to XP from winning.  Abusing the perks (not really a glitch, the devs just didn't think it through when they made these perks) may have ruined my ""honor"" or whatever, but it doesn't change the fact that I was one of the first people to get the A3/Leo 2AV, before crew skills even worked."
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,Gatortribe,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:16:01 2015 UTC,I'm not one of those out with pitchforks because some people are using an unintended bug/glitch in the game. These tests are for catching these things now instead of later when many more will be playing.  I just mainly wanted to point out that those using it might have a distorted view of the grind/their progression in game due to farming XP from it.
ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,zoobrix,0,Mon Jun 15 19:26:16 2015 UTC,"It certainly made the 2AV grind go faster. I'd say it reduced it by 20 games. My damage per game in it is terrible though, since it has less penetration than the tier 5 MBTs."

ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,atriax,2,Mon Jun 15 05:13:28 2015 UTC,I felt 7-8 was where the hardest work went in. From the lines I went down the 8s felt worth it (such as Tiger 2 and AMX 13 90). Also just because one company does it a certain way does not mean another company should do it as well.

If you are not a ""no-life"" player then you have to pay to advance. Wich takes the fun out of it. You get to a certain point that you just get tired of doing the same thing over and over and over again and just quit.  Don't get me wrong I have several tier X tanks, all honest grinds not pay to win, only a bit of premium time to help me along. But it takes too long.  ATM it think the grind in AW in the lower tiers is maybe a bit too easy and fast. But that's because of the testing, dev team want's us to test all the vehicles as fast as possible.  I would like to spend an equal amount of time in a tank unrelated to it's tier. Now you can hop into a tier two ""tank"" really fast. It would be nicer if you had to play a bit longer in the lower tiers so you get the hang of the basics etc. before you venture in other tanks and don't learn from gameplay, because you can Rambo your way through the tiers.  If the game is fun enough (well balanced-no shit matchmaker), you actually want to keep your lower tier tanks and keep playing them. Instead of rushing through the trees/tanks thinking the next one is going to be better and instead your going from shit-storm to shit-storm."

ArmoredWarfare,39vpni,AdurianJ,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"The game feels grindy primarily because it's Early Access and my play time is limited.  I also want a more linear progression for higher tiers - it doesn't matter what 4-5 feels like. It's the 7 to 8 that I'm worried about.  In WoT the grind was acceptable up to tier 8, tier 8 to tier 9 was annoying. Tier 9 to tier 10 was torture. 8 to 10 required about as much XP as reaching tier 8. AW better not have such a grind curve.     I like the do ""X amount of damage from Y range"" because it's refreshing compared to having a whole bunch of useless low-tiers.  It also forces players to broaden their approach to the game - snipers learn to close in, knife fighters learn to snipe.   Would love to have unique tanks that unlock based on ""Average Damage per Match in tank X after Y games"" and similar goals that teach people to be competitive.   Would be nice to have unique tanks that unlock after competitive challenges like ""Do X average damage in Tank Y over Z matches"", that can be reset and tried again.   Perhaps such Missions should reward Free XP."

ArmoredWarfare,39tpjg,bspooky,2,Sun Jun 21 08:47:51 2015 UTC,"Literal definition of retrofit is adding a component or accessory to something that didn't have it when manufactured. As applied to Armored Warfare many seem to believe the way the comments are here so far...that it is customizing tank configurations to different variations or modernizing it.   I am pretty sure this is not what it is going to be though.  In AW different variants will just be different tanks, they have pretty much said this. Also, modernization something like adding a different NATO gun to to it or adding reactive armor would greatly impact the tank's characteristics, thus making it so it should be on a different tier.   I buried thoughts on the upcoming retrofit system in a grinding article for the blog http://armoredtalk.com/2015/05/31/grinding-in-armored-warfare-and-upgrades-between-proven-and-renowned-vehicle-status/ but in short:  1) The retrofit system will be goodies for your vehicles  2) Those goodies will not impact gameplay at all or if they do it will be very minor. This is why it can't be modernizing a tank or adding strong components. They just can't because they have to a) preserve balance but b) once you reach proven status (the 50% mark) your tank is fully upgraded as far a combat capabilities go. They are not going to make you have to get to 75% or whatever extra reputation is needed to add retrofits in order to have a tank that is fully upgraded for combat...people would feel like they are grinding under-performing tanks for way to long. So if the retrofits can't have combat capabilities they are going to be more accessories.    3) Something besides just getting reputation for the next tank should go between proven and renowned.  4) Somewhere they need to put how to get different camo paint for your tanks, add decals, earn commanders, etc."

ArmoredWarfare,39tm1k,RickR13,6,Sun Jun 14 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"Applique armor is essentially extra armor plating over specific parts of the tank (Turret/Eyepatch effect on Chieftain).  Effective primarily against AP rounds, as it's just an extra layer of solid, spaced armor.  ERA is Explosive Reactive Armor.  It is primarily effective against HEAT rounds and ATGMs and the like; essentially, when a round impacts one of the ERA plates, it detonates.  The resulting explosive force deflects the HEAT round's own away from the tank, lessening the damage or, ideally, mitigating it entirely.  In AW of course, it generally results in an auto-bounce for HEAT rounds (or no-pen if you prefer).  But, each individual ERA plate is one-use only, after which they are useless.  There's your layman's terms for it.  Best I can do, so good luck!"

ArmoredWarfare,39s44z,OfensiveBias,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:00:53 2015 UTC,I would say that is bad map design and would happen if there was no incentive.

There's really no need to rush for them. I could potentially buy a BMP-1, Swingfire and an arty, I have all the objectives done. I just don't have any cash to get any of them. So I'm still going to have to wait.  By the time you unlock these prerequisites through normal play, you'll be ready to buy the new tank. Don't rush like I did."
ArmoredWarfare,39s44z,Siriothrax,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't - if people are smart and use appropriate tanks for the mission. For example, when I wanted to get the short-range mission done for the Sheridan, I just played my T-62 as I normally would. I was at 7k when I started, and I hit the requirement of 30k by the time I finished grinding. Swingfire's spotting mission? Use the LAV-150 or BMP, if you have it unlocked. LAV-300 sniping over 300m? Unlock Swingfire, Arty, or the Leopard, then play normally.   Don't know where this mention of shooting on the move is coming from. If so, acquire Sheridan, or use the PT-76 if you really need to.  So, yeah, IMO, the people dumb enough to YOLO for these missions would do really poorly anyways."
ArmoredWarfare,39s44z,imaginary_num6er,5,Sun Jun 14 06:21:59 2015 UTC,"Unlock Swingfire, Arty, or the Leopard, then play normally.   Yeah, with the Swingfire lets just camp in base with the 505m view range and not help our team. Seriously, this needs to stop."

ArmoredWarfare,39qztb,G18AkimboPro,3,Sun Jun 14 02:30:16 2015 UTC,"Its locked reputation. Unlike WoT, where you pay money to get XP from an elited tank, here the Reputation an elited tank creates goes into a global pool from which you can convert for money.  http://aw.my.com/forum/showthread.php?14950-Early-Access-2-More-Formal-Informal-Patch-Notes   Locked Reptuation/Global Reputation Changes - We have changed the way Global Reputation accumulates in this version. Now when a vehicle has reached Renown status (100% progress on its Reputation bar), any additional Reputation earned on that vehicle will accumulate in two pools. The vehicle itself will continue to accumulate Reputation, the intent of which will become clear when the Retrofit System is introduced. In addition, an equal amount of Reputation will be added to a 'Locked Reputation' pool which is global across all your vehicles. Instead of converting Vehicle Reputation into Global Reputation, you will convert Locked Reputation into Global Reputation. Global Reputation can then be spent on accelerating any vehicle progress. When spending Global Reputation to advance a vehicle's Reputation Bar, you will also be given an equivalent amount of additional Vehicle Reputation to spend on upgrades. When spending Global Reputation directly on upgrades, the vehicle's Reputation Progress bar will be advanced accordingly. This means there is no wrong way to spend your Global Reputation to speed up progress on a vehicle."
ArmoredWarfare,39qztb,nuxes,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:07:41 2015 UTC,So we can't actually use it until they implement gold currency?

But it doesn't stay with one tank, so when you get your next one you could use some to get the upgrade you need if you don't have the required amount of the other currency.  You can also use it to boost unlocking your next tank as well if I remember correctly. Just click the xp bar for your current tank and check."
ArmoredWarfare,39qztb,atriax,0,Sun Jun 14 03:29:28 2015 UTC,"It's the equivalent of ""free xp"" in WoT. You can pool it up or use it to upgrade things from stock or whatever. You earn xx amount (I don't actually know since the game doesn't tell you) per battle on top of your regular tank xp.  When you click upgrade on the left side of the screen you'll see your tank xp (reputation whatever it's called) added with this xp to give you a total xp that's spendable for that tank."

ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,Yetanotherfurry,7,Sun Jun 14 00:31:13 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. With how slow the progression is it feels like a waste of time to grind knowing progress will be reset
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,Gerbils74,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:35:47 2015 UTC,How much have you played? I have the M1 and the Leo 2. It took 150 battles in the 2AV which isn't that much.

ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,Gerbils74,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:49:47 2015 UTC,However with set dates and times it is very much a lot. Progression should have been accelerated.
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,bspooky,4,Sun Jun 14 18:35:15 2015 UTC,"In WoT too everyone wants tier 10. I understand top tier is king of the hill, but playing lower and mid tiers in AW I would think would be just as fun as playing the top tier. Maybe the guys who have 7s already like seal clubbing, but when a lot of people do ... What's the rush? Why in either game is playing on a high tier worth grinding just to do so vs playing what tanks are fun no matter the tier?  In WoT I was climbing the tiers in a lot of lines and have several 10s, but doing the skirmish tournaments taught me to like most tiers and I stopped trying to grind a few more lines up.   So just play/test for fun and let the credits / reputation come when they come to get the next tier up?"
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,avalon304,-1,Sun Jun 14 03:10:52 2015 UTC,"well in WoT I didn't really find a tank that I properly enjoyed until the KT, so that was 8 tiers after a lot of jumping around, at one point I had 3k battles and only 2 tier 6s with nothing higher, and I think it'll be similar in AW, I'll have to climb a bit until I can find a tank that I can punch within and above my weight with and properly enjoy. that tank is not at tier 3."
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,RiverDell,3,Sun Jun 14 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"Not feeling it nearly as much as you (mostly because Im not hardcore grinding toward anything because hooray account wipes), but I do have a feeling that this game is going to be subject to that feeling of burnout a lot more than WoT is..."
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,RiverDell,2,Sun Jun 14 01:01:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how to handle this. I assume you're progressing down a tree that you like the end of but not the ones in the middle. Either clench your buttocks and grind through it or reroll to something you actually enjoy. I wanted to grab the Stingrays but after rocking with the PT-76 and the Scorpion, I despised the T-62 so I rerolled.   The Patton was lovely when you're top tier with it and it could also destroy even the T-64. I'm having an absolute blast in the Leopard which is a gorgeous vehicle and a beast if you get to know the maps and are able to flank with it.  My advice is, stop grinding stuff, downgrade a bit and try other tanks, I'm pretty sure our progress will be wiped numerous times over anyway 'till the game actually gets released.  edit: Also, go ahead and take a break if you feel like you need it, grab some games from the Steam Summer Sale. ;)"
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,Bluenosedcoop,0,Sun Jun 14 00:51:00 2015 UTC,"well I'm grinding towards the BMP-2 right now, I played a lot of mediums in WoT so it seems like a good fit, but the BMP-1 is just simply anemic so I had to jump over to the T-62 to grind out the credits, but that hasn't been going well for me as I seem to miss and bounce more often than not, I've already tried the M60 and honestly wasn't that impressed, I didn't like the M113 or LAV-150, I hated the scorpion and the PT-76 was pretty meh to me, so right now I'm trying the swingfire and frankly not enjoying the lack of mobility."
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:53:50 2015 UTC,"The BMP-1 is my most hated vehicle so far, the lack of gun depression makes it unplayable in most situations for me. The T-62 is just simply inferior to the M60 Patton in every single way (in my opinion), I disliked it wholeheartedly. The Patton is slow but has a meaty gun and really nice armor for its tier, if you get 'Floor It' as your first driver perk it outruns the T62 even.  The M113 and the LAV-150 require you to use your mobility and flank slow tanks (the same tactic you kinda need to use in the Leopard 1) while the Scorpion is a great sniper and arty hunter (that's something that the M113 and LAV-150 is good at as well), they all resemble the light class from WoT so that could be why you dislike them.  The High Caliber Lights from Shishkin, and the Leopards resemble WoT mediums the most from what I could tell so far."
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,welinator122,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:12:49 2015 UTC,"yeah the leopard seems to be a pretty solid tank, but I already have the BMP-2 unlocked and my patton is on EU so I've been hesitant to grind it out."
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,Alazais86,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"I've been playing the BMD-1 which i think is a lot like the BMP-1 apart from BMD has missiles (which i don't use anyway) and it has to be played in a very specific way which i find changes from map to map, I've had some really rather amazing games in it where i've broken the 2k xp mark.  Sometimes passive scouting works though i don't know if the BMP-1 has the recon package like the BMD does, I load more of HE-Frag than i do of HEAT with like a 20/32 loadout because many MBT's can't obviously be damaged frontally but the HE can do some really good damage including modules.  As to why you are bouncing with the T-62 that's entirely weird because with the top AP round you have 259 pen and shouldn't be having much of a problem with anything."
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,Hotblack_Desiato_,0,Tue Jun 16 00:15:45 2015 UTC,The BMP can't really passive scout effectively in a world of swingfires. Or even LAVs for that matter
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,diomedesbc,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:20:22 2015 UTC,"It's all dependent on your map knowledge and awareness of how vulnerable you, The BMP-1 still has a 471m view range better than most tanks in the game (including the BMD-1 which can only get to 467m is it's stationary).  Your whole argument that it's bad because others are better isn't really a good one is it, You make do with what you have and adapt to the map."
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,KexanR,-1,Tue Jun 16 01:33:03 2015 UTC,I can't grab anything in the summer sale due to a clerical error resulting in my bank account being automatically closed.
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,CDXVI,2,Sun Jun 14 01:11:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah i only got halfway through tier 3 before i was burnt out, I think the grind between tanks is a bit too much atm and it should be toned down abit"
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,goodoldxelos,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:27:43 2015 UTC,I don't think the grind is that bad at all since this latest test. Biggest problem is we're all comparing it too much to WoT (most of us) and that has 2 tiers more so progression will be slower in AW until it eventually gets tier 9s and maybe 10s which isn't going to happen for probably a year nearly.  The problem comes from having to grind through something that is bad. I understand you can't fudge too many things and if a tank is bad in real life it can't shine too brightly in AW (a la BMP 1) but you've gotta either find a tank you enjoy playing or a line you don't mind grinding through to get to one you think you really will enjoy. Because actually enjoying the tank you're currently playing makes ALL the difference imo.
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,TheAylius,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:33:54 2015 UTC,"I guess you need to learn to appreciate every vehicle for what it is.  Enjoy it on its own merit.  I love the LAV-150, and if I were somehow restricted to playing ONLY that vehicle, I'd still play.  It's a hoot."
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,strifeisback,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:56:41 2015 UTC,Same here. Lav150 is a blast
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,TheAylius,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:41:25 2015 UTC,It's easier to feel burnt out at this stage because there's not as much variety in maps and tanks yet. Once the game goes live hopefully there will be a lot more maps and a lot more dealers so you can try different tech trees if you get bored with one.
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,Terrachova,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"We need more tanks, maps, and PvE. Of cos you will be burnt out soon if you only have 5 maps and 30ish tanks (most people could only access 4-5 low-tier ones of them) to play with."
ArmoredWarfare,39rd7t,Gatortribe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:41:03 2015 UTC,I really don't understand why they don't give us a portion of our progress as a type of reward for testing. Maybe in the form of free xp.

ArmoredWarfare,39q535,atriax,2,Sun Jun 14 00:36:59 2015 UTC,No. It's normally the same. However (lets use the t62 for reference since I remember the numbers off the top of my head).  The regular reload for my t62 was 7.4 seconds. If I had AP loaded and had HEAT selected (meaning it would change to HEAT after I fired) and fired a round then double tapped (to interrupt the reload) to go back to AP my reload was 5.9 seconds. Why am I reloading 1.5 seconds faster for no reason? That's the bug/exploit/glitch. It's very obnoxious on vehicles like the Stingray.
ArmoredWarfare,39q535,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:18:47 2015 UTC,Yeah i've been spammed down a few times by MBTs who fires 2-3 shots for every one I could with max reload perks.

ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,diomedesbc,2,Sun Jun 14 06:11:52 2015 UTC,"FYI while firing look below your rangefinder. There will be a 2nd distance popping up, showing how far the missile had traveled so far. It helps lobbing missiles over ridges or around corner but its still very easy to miss."
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,ItumTR,6,Mon Jun 15 08:38:32 2015 UTC,That thing is total bs.  Totally worse than any arty in WoT.  Game ruining imo.
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,FlexBravo,3,Sat Jun 13 01:40:01 2015 UTC,"the problem isnt atgms, its the swingfires viewrange and camo, nerf those and it would be fine"
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,Ragebringer,2,Sat Jun 13 13:46:21 2015 UTC,No. THe problem is that it fires missiles from behind rocks. It doesn't matter if it has camo or not. It's shooting you from behind hard cover.
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,atriax,4,Sat Jun 13 18:20:40 2015 UTC,"not the problem, if you believe that then the swingfire is simply outplaying you. If you are out in the open and letting him slap you then you deserve to be eaten by em.  The problem again, comes from the fact that the swingfire can spot while hidden and fire at targets. To counter this a view range nerf and perhaps less camo would be fine. Firing behind cover isnt unique to the Swingfire, it is possible with with any atgms"
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,Ragebringer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:05:09 2015 UTC,"The swing fire can only shoot around very gentle hills.  The issue isn't really the missile system, it's the broken view range."
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,FrankyMcShanky,2,Sun Jun 14 02:30:43 2015 UTC,I mean it is beta they will figure it out somehow...
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,Mr_Roblcopter,0,Sat Jun 13 06:29:59 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. There is no cover against it, it is nearly invisible and does tons of damage. Its like arty 3.0"
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,Regyn,3,Sat Jun 13 11:11:55 2015 UTC,I think a lot of why things seem so broken right now is that the matchmaking is putting together very strange matches.  In the current iteration Swingfire seems very strong because of its combination of traits.  But I have seen matches where a coordinated group of AFVs with good guns have torn apart a trio of Swingfires.  They're very vulnerable if they have to do anything other than snipe from behind cover or from behind your own front line.  They have trouble defending themselves.
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,ooburai,4,Fri Jun 12 22:36:39 2015 UTC,"But in that situation you are only thinking of the swingfires as being the only tanks in the match, But their massive view range allows the rest of a team to snipe anyone spotted by the swingfires."
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,CunningB,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:01:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue with them is that they out spot most of the AFV's, so getting close enough is a real issue; even more so when they hide with a little MBT support.  A tank with indirect fire that can put itself out of reach and can out spot light vehicles is pretty much invisible and therefore invulnerable in most matches!"
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,ooburai,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:00:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean.  But I'm ok with a a game that doesn't have a hard counter to some classes.  The Swingfire can't really handle any kind of coordinated attack at all, it may take one of the attackers with it but it's very unlikely to do more than that.  The trick is first closing that ~100m gap where it can see you but you can't see it.  To me it's an awesome game feature since it requires the opposing team to think like an armoured unit for a moment rather than half a dozen individuals hoping Swingfire gets the other guy.  I think once the matchmaker gets implemented properly it will lose a lot of its reputation since it's a real bully against lower tier vehicles and slower MBTs, but it's not very threatening to a tier 4-6 tank."
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,MrRick1781,2,Mon Jun 15 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"Its the flavour of the month, it will happen a lot as the buff and nerf tanks throughout the beta/EA. Cant tell you how many times I see it in multiplayer games now people just like an easy life."
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,W4lt3r89,2,Sat Jun 13 12:08:39 2015 UTC,"One way to fix them would be:   Longer setup time - like 4-5 seconds. Missile must have LOS to the Swingfire fire to guide it, since these are wire-guided missiles. Also the Swingfire (and any other tank with wire-guided missiles) must remain stationary for the missile to be guided properly. Movement would add vibrations to the wire and cause it to go haywire.   This would at least eliminate their ability from being able to fire over hills and such, which is one nuisance on couple maps."
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,VoteRonaldRayGun,2,Sat Jun 13 12:12:22 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who has not had trouble with Swingfires?

That thing can out-spot me and it doesn't lose enough camo after it fires it's missiles. I've literally had 3 missiles fly at me right after I got spotted.
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,ItumTR,4,Sat Jun 13 07:12:19 2015 UTC,"Your job in a TD is to dps MBT and Light tanks. Not to be the first in line to yolo in and complain that you get wrecked.  Almost all AFW will outspot you, its not a trait of the swingfire."
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,CruxMajoris,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:20:17 2015 UTC,"I feel they need their view range nerfed, just so they're more reliant on friendlies to spot for them. Give them an MBT's viewrange, and it can sit behind the frontline whilst the frontline spots for them.  Dying a lot to them because I get a warning an ATGM is coming my way. Where from? Nobody knows. At least with arty you can go evasive."
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,FMAlcoholist,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:55:13 2015 UTC,"People are throwing around the term overpowered way too freely. Is the swingfire strong? Absolutely it is. That does not make it OP. The only thing that I think needs to be changed is it's ability to fire missiles from third person. And MAYBE a small view range nerf.   People keep complaining about the Swingfire but the VBL and Wiesel both have the same view range, are more mobile, and also have the option to use missiles. So it's not like the Swingfire is the only vehicle in the game with the kit it has.   Also, too many people just play it wrong. They want to sit way in back and snipe with missiles. It's a recon not a TD. When I was grinding through it I would actually move to a forward position and spot for my team. Sometimes not even shooting anything till later in the game when I had to re-position.   I've really enjoyed taking up the scouting role and I love that they've actually made it rewarding to do. I would be sorely disappointed if they nerfed that into the ground because of whiners. But that's just my two cents."
ArmoredWarfare,39n24x,goodoldxelos,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:31:05 2015 UTC,"First ATGMs need to be limited in count (30 is too many) and perhaps a minimum range of 10-20 meters should be fine and fair. Second the swingfire missile is too agile, I can recall one time I was circling behind a swingfire and the missile shot out then spun / turned 180 degrees hitting me behind the swingfire vehicle within 10 meters."

And also its ability to fire over obstacles and still hit people even if they are within 100m or so which should never happen with ATGM because of the arming distance, I've been having many swingfires come up that close to me because they know they can still slap you even at close range."

ArmoredWarfare,39ndvo,VoteRonaldRayGun,2,Sat Jun 13 02:50:27 2015 UTC,"What ShadowSVK said but they don't have any particular use. Their armor is terrible, especially in low tiers which gives no incentive to grind for the higher tier end-game tanks."
ArmoredWarfare,39ndvo,strifeisback,2,Sat Jun 13 21:16:41 2015 UTC,Their armor isn't bad. The problem is the huge number of higher tier tanks that get put in the same matches.
ArmoredWarfare,39ndvo,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:31:05 2015 UTC,"The M60 for example, which is currently the best t3 MBT armor wise, has a 143mm frontal plate even with a 50 degree slope which I doubt it has is only roughly 220mm effective straight on. Angle at a 69* angle and you get 620mm of armor, according to the WoT calculator, but even then you're not going to angle like that in the midst of a battle- that's only realistically sticking out of a corner attempting to bait a shot before pulling around and firing yourself. At the maximum angle, front on and still allowing the side to be at a 70* auto bounce angle, you get an effective 233.92 frontal plate.  The t4 Sheridan, which it would see in normal matchmaking rounds, has 371mm of penetration with it's 152mm M409A1 HEAT round, and 528mm of penetration with it's Shillelagh ATGM. The T-62 has 259mm of penetration with its 115mm 3UBM9 APFSDS and can pen the M60 at will, same can be said in regards to the M60 penning the T-62 for obvious reasons.   The BMP-1, a tier 3 AFV, has 144mm with it's best HEAT round so it will actually have trouble with an M60 but probably not a T-62 with its glorious 102mm of frontal plate. Swingfire, t4 AFV, has 428mm of penetration.   So of the tanks the M60 can face only the t3 BMP-1 cannot pen it reliably. Include the shoddy tier 2 tanks and none of those can pen it for obvious reasons, yet they all get HE so they still do considerable module damage effectively hampering or disabling the MBT.  Like I said, they're not in a good state at the moment. And while armor progressively increases in higher tiers so do the ATGM's penetration and we haven't even taken a look at Tank Destroyers...  Just because WoT's lower tiers are shit doesn't mean Armored Warfare's need to be or even should be. You need to incentivize the grind to the end-game content, not show how useless the tank class is at what it's supposed to do best- armor. Especially when they are shite everywhere else to include mobility, and gun performance (at least alpha wise, AFV's dominate MBT's there)."
ArmoredWarfare,39ndvo,strifeisback,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:39:50 2015 UTC,"I bounce shots all the time in my Patton and T-62 against lower tiers. Every game I get a few bounces against those of equal tier and can take 2-3 hits more than the other tanks on my team.  Every game it's the MBTs that carry and push forwards, get most damage, and defend choke points.   MBTs may not be really tough, but they're by far tougher than any other class tank. The only exception to this is the Sheridan which remains a pretty broken tank."
ArmoredWarfare,39ndvo,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:46:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, lower tiers as I pointed out in my post like the Scorpion and LAV-150 which have shit guns. Now, take into effect the T-64 with it's 164mm frontal plate (205 with a .80 AP multiplier is 164 and the SC multiplier of 1.5 brings it to 307, still not enough to reliably bounce even the Swingfire or Sheridan ATGM). What are you bouncing in it? I can safely say you're not going to bounce shit. Since we obviously have to take the discussion up the tree a bit more.  Edit: You won't be bouncing the BMD-1, the BMD-2, the Chief. Mk5, the T-72, the T-62, the Sheridan, the Swingfire, the Leo1, the M60A3, BMP-2, VBL, LAV-300, etc.  Maybe I just suck and drive my vehicles straight into road blocks only to get nerfed into oblivion. But these are my experiences and the problems I have with the game. Whether or not you bounce reliably, I don't. And that's the problem, lol. If you can't bounce anything but the tier below yours, why the hell are you going to play an MBT that can't flex, and can't carry as well as an AFV with ATGM's or a Tank Destroyer as a solo player. Playing an MBT becomes about trading your HP smarter than the other guy, as in letting him pop out to shoot someone else, then you pop to shoot him. Rinse, repeat. Stale, boring gameplay. Whereas currently with AFV's you sit back, abuse the 'spectacular' spotting system and blow everything to bits while never being lit."
ArmoredWarfare,39ndvo,strifeisback,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:03:30 2015 UTC,If you angle the armor properly you can bounce other heavies and almost every auto-canon without doing anything.

They're supposed to be general use machines, less view/camo than an AFV, smaller gun than a TD, less mobility than an LT, etc.  The T-62 does feel similar a T-62 in WoT from my experience, even though they call it a medium tank it has absurd armor due to the angle. It fits the MBT role in this game quite well but does seem slower than in WoT. Also a tier 10 god tier WoT tank can't be compared with a beginner MBT in AW."

Also you have to understand, there are modules and items missing from the game right now since its early access.

ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,CaptainKapautz,0,Sun Jun 14 15:32:52 2015 UTC,"I dunno I got straight up machine-gunned by one earlier, hit me literally more than twice as fast as I could shoot back."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,Durandy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:11:16 2015 UTC,He was probably Ammo swap bugging you. You can do that in a T-64 as well.
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,atriax,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:18:56 2015 UTC,That's not the leo. That's the player exploiting the ammo swap bug. It's getting pretty bad. They need to just remove the skill.
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,yosp,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:31:26 2015 UTC,"I gotta give it to the BMP-1, the gun can't pen MBTs from the side even sometimes, the lack of AP ammo is gonna be ever harder on it when ERA becomes a factor, they didn't give it an ATGM, it's HP pool is roughly equivalent to 2-3 shots from most tanks, and despite it's front armor being rated for 23mm rounds autocannons tear through it like paper. It struggles to do anything but sit as far in the back as possible and spam HE."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,Whitedeath5,2,Sat Jun 13 05:46:29 2015 UTC,Not to mention the horrible gun depression thrown into the mix. Makes everything you said worse.
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,jonttu125,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:00:34 2015 UTC,"To add to that, its base accuracy is fucking awful. I swear to god, I shoot at something standing still and the fucking projectile flies straight to the fucking sky or into the nearest rock."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,nuxes,2,Sun Jun 14 00:27:20 2015 UTC,I really wouldn't mind the BMP-1 getting it's heat ammo buffed to it's actual penetration of about 350 mm instead of the shitty 140 it has.
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,Ragebringer,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"In real life,  the main problem with the BMP-1's gun was the horrible accuracy. That high penetration wasn't very useful when MBTs had twice the effective range.  In game,  the ranges are much shorter, so the two options are to either give the gun horrible accuracy and high pen,  or reasonable accuracy and mediocre pen. I think Obsidian picked the latter to cut down on the RNG factor."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,iwancoppa,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:11:36 2015 UTC,the BMP isnt meant to frontally engage MBTs so i feel 350mm of pen would be silly at its tier. I have been having decent luck with HE
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,smartuy,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:07:58 2015 UTC,"'Rated for 23mm' Maybe on the turret glacis. BMP1's have well documented armor protection which is, quite frankly, laughable in the face of anti-tank weaponry. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP-1#Armor_protection"
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,nuxes,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:52:26 2015 UTC,"BMP-1 IRL had 300mm penetration with HEAT rounds, more than enough the penetrate the front of any NATO MBT."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,Highw4ySt4r,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:27:25 2015 UTC,"I would say keep the gun the same,  but give it the Sagger missile it had historically. That's a fairly primitive ATGM,  so it shouldn't be OP."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,bspooky,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"I love my BMP-1. It's got great speed and handling. The gun depression is garbage though, even driving over curbs will throw my aim up and stop me shooting the enemy. The gun pen isn't terrible. I make it work."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,TheAylius,0,Sat Jun 13 13:17:51 2015 UTC,"I don't get the hate for the BMP-1...tanks need pros and cons or they all play the same. Right now with so few tanks in AW many seem to play the same to me. For instance, the tier 3 MBTs have their differences but are pretty interchangeable imo.  The BMP-1 plays quite a bit differently though so I like it. Scout with it first, then flank. I love the speed. And yes, the heat round fails to pen, but if it penned all the time this tank would be OP."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,Alazais86,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:59:20 2015 UTC,The Chieftan and Leo2AV. They both need serious treatment
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,King_of_Nope,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:07:47 2015 UTC,"Was playing earlier at around 6am and the enemy team had a Leo 2AV on their team and I'd get matched up with him time and time again for many games, he consistantly came in the top few of his team doing like 3-5k damage a game. Not to mention disposed of my Chieftain (admitedly stock at the time) with ease. So forgive me for not quite believing that entirely!"
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,Bluenosedcoop,3,Sat Jun 13 09:29:07 2015 UTC,"Well the Leo 2AV is still a tier higher, so it should come out on top most of the time over a Chieftain. That being said from what I hear is that they are both pretty bad. Its like two paraplegics fighting, but one is a kid while the other is an adult."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,Alazais86,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:53:43 2015 UTC,The only thing there is that people don't realise the glaring weakspots of the Leo 2AV.
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,Gatortribe,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:53:16 2015 UTC,"I've found the turret ring so far, but you need good accuracy for hitting that repeatedly. Which weakspots does it have then?"

ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,MainerZ,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"Put the BMD-1 alongside your BMP-1, I really need to try hard to even get an average game, The only thing it has over the BMP-1 is ATGM and even then at 20s reload they are shit.  Also the LAV-300 is pretty damn horrible to play, It requires 27k XP to even get an AP round, Then you find that AP round is only 1mm of penetration more than the top AP round of the Tier 3 T-62, A few of us were saying back in alpha feedback forums the tank either needs dropped a tier or given a better AP round it just does not fit into Tier 5."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,Terrachova,0,Sat Jun 13 20:49:28 2015 UTC,T62. God that thing is awful.
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,Grummond,0,Sat Jun 13 15:50:08 2015 UTC,"Chieftain, definitely.  It's basically just a massive XP pinata compared to the other amazing tier 5s.  Sad, really, because its also easily one of the best looking tanks in the game."
ArmoredWarfare,39oefn,smartuy,-5,Sat Jun 13 21:46:46 2015 UTC,"SU 26 comes to mind. The thing used to be fun to play. Didn't do much damage but it was still fun. They overnerfed it and now it's never played any more. Must be months since I've seen one in game.  Also, I just realized this is /r/armoredwarfare and not /r/worldoftanks. Downboats to hell with this comment!"
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,K1ttykat,3,Sat Jun 13 09:06:56 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your premise that AFVs are intended to hunt artillery. They're effective at it, yes, but the AFV should only be going for artillery when the game has been already won on the back of his vision and harassment work to eliminate the majority of the main fighting forces. Meanwhile, any CB work by artillery is most valuable in the early game, before the enemy arty has a chance to output his damage. Since AFVs and Arty are effective at countering arty at different times, I don't see this as an issue."
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Siriothrax,2,Sat Jun 13 19:01:49 2015 UTC,"It's not like the AFV's role is to scout their artillery. I don't know why it bothers you.  Artillery being focused on enemy artillery is good for both sides' vehicles and the artillery, so you don't just sit there and click every few seconds to shoot some unsuspecting tank!"
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Vroco,2,Sat Jun 13 14:46:43 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever seen arty kill another arty. Most learn their lesson quickly and get mobile. You should be spotting MBTs or whatever is carrying their team.
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:37:26 2015 UTC,Nahhh . so many times I killed arty. Arty will take a while to kill each other.
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Stromovik,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:42:53 2015 UTC,"The point in taking the risk is that AFVs are much, much better at killing SPGs than SPGs are at killing each other. You can gun two or three of them down in seconds with an autocannon, they often struggle to hit each other thanks to shell travel times."
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Tang0Three,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:46:43 2015 UTC,"Your concern is valid, but your idea relies on other players using their vehicles to find arty.  You can't rely on them for that.  The current system reduces some of the dependency you have on your team members and lets intelligent players stay alive a little longer by paying attention.  Is it ideal?  No.  But it's better than what some of us have seen in the past (viz. WoT)."
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Hotblack_Desiato_,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:51:35 2015 UTC,"I think the circle on the ground could be good, but still don't think the counter battery notification should be removed. Arty has to be able to have a counter throughout the game, and not just the end. I haven't played Artillery but I know many who have who love the system because it makes the artillery class much more dynamic and challenging."
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Whitedeath5,-1,Sun Jun 14 00:25:44 2015 UTC,AFV? do you mean IFV?
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Highw4ySt4r,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"They are all AFVs, without infantry its not an IFV"
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Zakreon,0,Sat Jun 13 14:10:45 2015 UTC,All vehicles in this game are Armoured Fighting Vehicles. Even a main battle tanks is an AFV.  I assumed he means light armoured vehicle (LAV )or infantry fighting vehicle (IFV). Because he's talking about scouting.
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Highw4ySt4r,2,Sat Jun 13 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"True, but in the game AFV or Armored Fighting Vehicle is used to refer to those vehicles. While LAV or IFV is the correct term for the vehicles it makes sense to use the same terminology as the game itself when discussing the classes in the game..."
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Leonick91,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"The game has never used the term ""AFV"" to only define lighter vehicles."
ArmoredWarfare,39otu7,Highw4ySt4r,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:24:51 2015 UTC,"And you feel certain about this? OK then.  Armored Warfare - Vehicle Class Gamplay video, starting at 6 minutes and 6 seconds you'll get an introduction to AFVs, MBTs and LTs come earlier in the video.   Next we have Armored Fighting Vehicles, this class contains a vast variety of light vehicles seen on the modern battlefield.   Some screenshots of vehicle details in the latest client, look at the first line of ""Class traits"":   The LAV-150 The Scorpion The BMP-1   EDIT: Oh, and then there is this when you queue for battle. Looking at the history tab we see that the LAV-150 is a ""hybrid light armored vehicle"", the Scorpion is an ""armored reconnaissance vehicle"", and the BMP-1 is an ""infantry fighting vehicle"". Obsidian has chosen to group all these vehicles in a single class and call it ""Armored Fighting Vehicles"" or AFV for short, you might not agree with them, not sure I do, but they did."

ArmoredWarfare,39nu1i,Galederp,2,Sat Jun 13 02:18:50 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with having a perk that reduces your loader skills. WoT has similar stuff.   The problem you are referencing is closer to an exploit where they are swapping ammo choices during the reload process so the perk cuts down times...at least that is how I understood it.  In any event, it is a bug they will be fixing:http://aw.my.com/en/forum/showthread.php?15663-&p=248128#post248128"
ArmoredWarfare,39nu1i,bspooky,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:52:12 2015 UTC,they could add some sort of hitpoint perk that could counteract this
ArmoredWarfare,39nu1i,like1ice,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:21:45 2015 UTC,Yeah this is clearly an exploit. I'm sure it'll be fixed at some point. It's a nice idea in theory but it should only probably work if you're switching ammo from a fully loaded gun already.
ArmoredWarfare,39nu1i,Alazais86,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:26:17 2015 UTC,It's clearly a bug. I'm pretty sure developers are aware of it. Don't spread the word about it for your own good.
ArmoredWarfare,39nu1i,Sisaroth,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:59:02 2015 UTC,Addendum: I'm not calling out people in tier 7 tanks. I congratulate them on their dedication. I just don't think that the reload perks should be this abusable.
ArmoredWarfare,39nu1i,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:20:44 2015 UTC,"It should have been removed almost immediately, But Obsidian either can't fix it immediately or won't.  But it surely as hell can't be doing much for balance numbers when tanks can put out rounds every 3-4 secs."
ArmoredWarfare,39nu1i,bspooky,3,Sat Jun 13 10:56:15 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it is because I used to be a developer, but their taking time to do patch rollouts in a controlled fashion is better than throwing hot fixes in that could do more damage than good is fine with me.   Servers down and nobody can play? hotfix. A bug in the game TEST? squash it in the next patch."
ArmoredWarfare,39nu1i,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:54:33 2015 UTC,I understand it all but when one bug increases the DPM of some tanks by almost double you would think something has to be done fast.  It ruins it for other people who don't use the bug and must surely throw out any balance statistics they might be recording.

ArmoredWarfare,39ka80,atriax,4,Fri Jun 12 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"It's not booming with popularity because people wan't want to buy in to a beta of a game that's in direct competition with WoT. WoT NA also has the lowest playerbase of all WoT regions, yet it has the most money spent per person."

I think the game is pretty fun, if kind of broken, right now and it clearly has a lot of potential simply because of the much more varied options with more modern armoured vehicles.  The only reason not to get in on Early Access is if you are simply opposed to paying for an unreleased product.  But if you think you'll buy any of the premium vehicles that are part of the bundles it starts to make a lot of sense."

ArmoredWarfare,39lbe9,TheAylius,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:04:19 2015 UTC,what are your reasons for this timeline?
ArmoredWarfare,39l360,OfensiveBias,2,Fri Jun 12 14:07:14 2015 UTC,"They should just not count premium bonus exp into the equation at all when it comes to your avg exp stats. Base Exp is the only thing that matters, whenever I see people comparing exp for matches in WoT the only thing people want to hear about is base Exp.  Sure you can keep your ""highest exp per match"" for fun with the inclusion of premium or various boosters but not the average imo. Long story short, I agree with you completely."
ArmoredWarfare,39l360,Alazais86,2,Fri Jun 12 14:35:54 2015 UTC,"Experience is a poor measure anyway.  Damage per battle, spotting rates, etc. are much better."
ArmoredWarfare,39l360,VoteRonaldRayGun,2,Fri Jun 12 14:55:15 2015 UTC,"As with any measure of skill, there are areas it fails.  Damage?  Possible to damage farm while losing games.  Spotting?  Suicide scout.  Experience?  Well, the only way to farm it is to purposely fail-toon.  You can get higher numbers by doing exceedingly well as bottom tier though, or in tanks that have disproportionaly good XP modifiers.  It's no better or worse than most, IMO."
ArmoredWarfare,39l360,Terrachova,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:04:43 2015 UTC,"If you're farming damage and dealing lots every game, you're still helping. I've lost games where I got 7 kills and top damage. Fail platoons don't work in WoT anyway, it's just idiots who think they do. If you're useless then the stats will show that. If a scout ends up getting 6-7 spots a game but 90% death rate you can see they're probably suicide scouting.  Some stats are more important than others, but none exist in a vacuum."

Not to mention, it's like shooting turkeys when you have a bunch of MBTs at range and you're just firing missiles at them with no mercy.  However, the missile accuracy seems to be iffy, which counter-acts some of the damage."
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,imaginary_num6er,3,Fri Jun 12 03:09:22 2015 UTC,It can also shoot from behind solid cover with no fear of reprisal...

ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,nuxes,2,Fri Jun 12 03:39:36 2015 UTC,All you can do with a swingfire you could do wth the sheridan
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,ItumTR,2,Fri Jun 12 06:47:34 2015 UTC,The Sheridan cant sit behind a rock and fire OVER the rock. Sheridans shoot their missiles straight at their targets... Swingfire's use top down attacks... their missiles go up and then come down.
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,avalon304,2,Fri Jun 12 06:50:40 2015 UTC,Yes it can.     Point you barrel to the side and up.  Hold RMB (it will lock up the position of the turret and barrel)  aim in 3rd Person and fire
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,ItumTR,-2,Fri Jun 12 06:54:59 2015 UTC,It's not meant to... and that should be fixed too then. Outside of artillery (which is a whole other ball of wax) no tank should be able to sit behind cover and fire with no fear of reprisal.
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,avalon304,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:10:13 2015 UTC,Positioning is king. I never had the feeling in my MBT that the Swingfire or sheridan ATGM were op.
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,ItumTR,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:37:21 2015 UTC,"I feel this way too. Also it feels like when your aggresive and constantly moving between cover that the swingfire can never get a good lock on your tank.   At the same time though, when it hits it hits like a truck, much more then an AFV ever would, especially at T4. how do you feel about its damage?"
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,ItumTR,2,Fri Jun 12 12:50:10 2015 UTC,"The alpha is okish, but the DPM is really lacking. you have to keep in mind that the reload is around 12 seconds with a skilled crew. Also the flighttime is usually around 4-5 seconds.   MBT usually kill my spotted/painted targets faster as im able even to hit it with my missile.  But i feel kinda bad from time to time pounding a sheridan in the open with my ATGM while beeing unspotted."

ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,rteague2566,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yea, but at the same time you can guide the missle to hit the treads/backside of an MBT to do a good chunk of damage."
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,VoteRonaldRayGun,2,Fri Jun 12 03:39:25 2015 UTC,I've found you have to be close to be at a distance to do that correctly and aimed at their treads because the missile has to come down at an angle and not hit the top of the tank. I posted a longer comment below too.
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,rteague2566,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:53:51 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. If a tank is moving to the left and you are positioned right leading your target, you will hit the tanks rear. If your Swingfire is on the side, the the missle could arc down to hit a side or a rear part of the tank. It is tricky but can be done consistently."
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,VoteRonaldRayGun,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:55:04 2015 UTC,It would be interesting if the Swingfire had terrible sight range while it was on the move and great sight range once it stood in place- could keep it from scouting on the fly and the moment that you engage it it loses its ability to see.
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,rteague2566,2,Fri Jun 12 03:21:10 2015 UTC,"TLDR: If the Dev's can prevent you from shooting overhead and around corners in third person view it'll be balanced, but right now its OP because of that. Otherwise its a great tank.  I suck at writing, so sorry if this is hard to follow but i gave enough detail to how the tank works and what you can expect from it.  Okay, so I actually got the tank yesterday and played all day with it plus today. You can actually check my post from yesterday for other opinions (Rephrased in Edit)  My impressions are that in the right situation its the best tank in the game at any tier right now. However its not often you get put in that situation. You need a bit of elevation, or a hill to hide behind and tons of tanks not looking your way.   Damage wise on 3s or less I do an average of 382-408 damage per hit; with bounces few and far in between. Tier 4 i can still get those hits but I get a lot more 180~ damage hits plus a bit more bounces from the T-64 (probably 1/3rd, but it really depends on your skill and angle because you can hit different parts of the tank and avoid the tough areas). The Leopard bounces me 1/5 shots but again that's skill dependent. Any other tanks I don't think I've ever bounced on, aside from higher tier MBTs; but I don't have enough experience playing against those.   The camo rating is INSANE... until you fire and lose it all. It's a great scout as its quick to accelerate and decently fast as a tracked vehicle. The view range is also wild, so if you can get on a hill you can overlook just about the whole map. So all around its a good passive scout and you can use it to lead a charge on open field since you'll spot other tanks (except Swingfires) before you're spotted.   But back to the damage, and here's the deal: You can't fire on the move, or for 1.5 seconds after moving (not that big of a deal to me personally), when you do fire though you lose almost 100% of your camo and just about anything can spot you and anything can pen you. So you have to be quick to move if you're close, or very far away.   You can negate the movement penalty and camo loss by hiding behind terrain and using third person to shoot tanks from over head -- which is something that needs to be fixed IMO because it makes the tank much stronger than it should be. You can't spot it, you can't damage it, and it can fire freely when this is used correctly."
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,CruxMajoris,4,Fri Jun 12 03:52:15 2015 UTC,The devs want to be able to shoot around corners with it. During the original developer commentary gameplay they show and praise someone who tries to move a missile around a corner. The missiles are slower and can't go through objects to balance it.
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,TheDecoyTV,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:47:06 2015 UTC,"I think the point is more that, in third person mode your using the camera to negotiate your missile around a mountain you normally would not be able to. Do the devs praise using the 3pv camera to guide a missile in that way? If they do, then do you feel the missile is too powerful or that its damage/pen is ok?"
ArmoredWarfare,39j1t5,TheDecoyTV,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:52:19 2015 UTC,I did not know that was intended. If that's the case then just a bit lower damage too it and I think it would even out. What do you think?

ArmoredWarfare,39eh3f,rteague2566,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:51:04 2015 UTC,"Missiles are fairly situational. If you get caught at close range with another AFV, then you're going to die very quickly. The long reload and the fact that you need to remain stationary for a few seconds is very bad for a fragile low hp vehicle like this.   Missiles are the only things it has, so once you shoot you better make sure you got backup or a good distance away.   Its not very fast for an AFV either so you're gonna have a hard time running away from what you face most of the time."
ArmoredWarfare,39eh3f,Crisis7,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:11:39 2015 UTC,It's true that if someone gets in your face you're in trouble but so far I've found the only time that happens is if the game has already been  lost. At a distance it seems it can wreck. It is my first AFV but it seems fast; great acceleration even if the top is only 54kmph. What are the other AFV speeds?
ArmoredWarfare,39eh3f,Crisis7,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:19:45 2015 UTC,"Its acceleration may seem great, but compared to other AFV's its below average. A lot of the AFV can go from 65 to 72 kmh and accelerate to that speed in less time it takes for the Swingfire to get to its max speed."
ArmoredWarfare,39eh3f,Terrachova,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:22:32 2015 UTC,The LAV-300 and Centauro are insanely speedy too.  Centauro can get up to like 100km/h on paved roads.  It's hilarious.
ArmoredWarfare,39eh3f,monilas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:24:07 2015 UTC,"Excellent camo, excellent view range.  The other thing that I like most of the time is the fixed launch angle. you're firing missiles at an upward angle, so if you use the 3rd-person camera you can lob missiles up and over cover or a ridgeline, or down a cliff.   Bit of a pain in the ass to pen enemies reliably though - sometimes I wish for an HE missile. (looking at you, T64, with the HEAT-resistant armour)"

This new system rewards great players very well (giving like 2000-3000XP) while giving norma/goodl level players okay earnings (800-1500). I like this system, since I'm surprisingly (only blue in WoT) good at the game, but I recognize that it won't work well. If the system is kept in OBT, there will be a massive discrepancy between great and good/okay players- the great will reach tier 8 in no time, while the good/okay will be at 6. Of course, it might be a good system when skilled MM is implemented.   I was able to grind out like 40k XP today on the T-72. I'm hoping I can do more on NA, since I won't be in a stock tank."

ArmoredWarfare,399ohq,Samurai_X,3,Wed Jun 10 06:55:35 2015 UTC,"I believe you're looking at the total download + install size (I'm seeing 25.2 GB). Once you've installed it, hit the options button in the upper right corner of the launcher, go to ""Games and downloads"", and there you can delete the installation files, freeing up some of that disk space.  Still, even when fully installed 43 GB is becoming pretty standard for some modern games with high-resolution textures, especially those with decently large maps (such as Armored Warfare). People freaked out about GTA 5's 65 GB download size, but ultimately hard drive space is absurdly cheap and games will likely continue to get larger as graphics cards are able to store and render even higher resolution textures. If space is an issue, I recommend getting another hard drive; they really are quite cheap (you can easily find a 1 TB hard drive for $50)."
ArmoredWarfare,399ohq,Zulunko,2,Wed Jun 10 07:12:37 2015 UTC,"It's CryEngine, I'd be looking at around 30-35GB total but that's a big assumption. Since it's a multiplayer game there will be continuous updates and it'll easily reach 40GB+ a few months down the line."

ArmoredWarfare,399ohq,Regyn,2,Wed Jun 10 12:01:42 2015 UTC,"I run it off of an SSD because, say my game crashes or I have to reset the client (as tends to happen in the games current state) I can load in very quickly.   Plus, not having to sit on a loading screen to go back to the garage is nice."

SilentStalker said ""Both sizes are correct and functional. What is the reason behind this, that I am trying to find out.""   Okay, here's the deal: both sizes are valid. The 10,83GB update size is basically an entirely new client, not ""just"" an update. The loader detects any tampering with game files so if you for example manually edited the preferences in the XML file (or possibly deleted the installation files), the loader will force a new client download. We apologize for this inconvenience."

ArmoredWarfare,390vw7,Bluenosedcoop,2,Tue Jun 9 01:34:22 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really work for people with regular 8-5 jobs. Best case; lets say you're single and running on CEST time: As a minimum You finish work at 5, incur travel time, get home, make dinner, then sit down to play. Lets say you're not far from work and dinner doesn't really take you long to make, you sort yourself out, relax a bit and maybe full on gaming by 6? You've gained nothing extra.  How about this; You're now on UK time, travel time is now 30 mins to an hour from home. You get in, say you have a child or two, and a partner. You've got interaction with them, maybe you're lucky and your partner cooks dinner, you sit down and eat. Then you relax for a few mins and indulge in a conversation and play, get your child(ren) ready for bed. Provided there's no washing to do or a little clean up in the living room, you're sat at the PC by 20:00. You now have an hour to play, but wait, wrong time zone! No test time for you. Best case scenario.  7 years ago plus, I was single, had a job had time to finish work at 16:30 GMT. Get into my room on barracks, log in, play games, have 10-15 mins to eat or eat as I played, and play on till 23:00 or 02:00 or just bloody whenever my body collapsed. Weekends? Play from when I wake up till whenever my drunk lonely self fell into bed. Such is the life of one who played WoW to such an extreme level.  Nowadays I've got a family, but am still an avid gamer and tester where I can. I can't ever get on early, but I can stay up late, I'm just not sure I get why they wouldn't extend later, I'd bet more people could get on.  Even 1 hour in to the end time would be nice. That's all. An extra 1 hour early start doesn't help a lot of people I'd wager.  I know they're doing what they're doing and I'll get the usual response of ""meh it's just a test"" etc, but I enjoy testing as much as I like a good moan."

This is the perfect time to try different things and see what works best.  They need to experiment and decided what's best. We can either:   Try your solution and see how it works. The Sheridan is already a great sniper, so it could work in the TD class. It would just break almost all historicism regarding the vehicle itself, but it wouldn't be the first time. Try Illusional's solution, switching the buff from no bloom on turret traverse to no bloom on hull traverse. This would certainly help with the Sheridan drive-by problem AND stop it from being a sniper (which it was anything but IRL) Just bump the damn thing up to tier 5 already. This could easily be paired with solution 1 and 2.    I completely agree with you regarding the changes they chose, I even chuckled when I saw the patch notes. You can reduce the reload all you want, hell give it a 20s reload. It'll still peek-a-boom MBTs to death and they won't be able to chase it.  EDIT: Spoke with a developer, they're testing a different LT bonus for problematic lights like the Sheridan (shouldn't be too many of them). It'll be interesting to see what it is."
ArmoredWarfare,38qels,Gatortribe,3,Sat Jun 6 01:39:05 2015 UTC,"Not surprisingly agree with most of your post.   would just break almost all historicism regarding the vehicle itself   The Sheridan having the Light Tank bonus is the biggest insult to ""Historicism"" in the game right now. Being that accurate with that gigantic 152mm on the move without fire control stabilization... If you look at the TD vehicles in the game - many of them were never designed with the Anti-Tank role.  They are Air-Delivered or Air-Dropped Infantry Fighting Vehicles.   The concept of the Tank Destroyer transitioned from dedicated vehicles to equipping a TOW launcher to an IFV. The B1 Centauro is a rare exception, but if you look at the design it's not much different from the M1128 MGS Stryker - which includes this in it's description ""it is not designed to engage in combat with tanks"".  So whether a modern light tank is called a TD or not is mostly the manufacturer's preference.  When selling to countries who plan to use it in the ""third world"" against outdated MBT designs, the ""Tank Destroyer"" name is good marketing. From the perspective of the US military, it's still an IFV with limited anti-tank capabilities. Need a bunker, sniper nest, or another IFV destroyed? Perfect. Forced to engage a modern MBT? Run.  Your statement from the Edit is promising. That would be a nice way to resolve things - would show flexibility by Obsidian."
ArmoredWarfare,38qels,Gatortribe,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:50:39 2015 UTC,"This has actually made me more interested in the Sheridan; I even found an educational video on it (which looks more like it was made for actual tankers at the time). At the time linked, they show the gunner turning on a stabilizer. It's actually sort of funny, the video demonstrates just how inaccurate it was, whether it was intentional or not.   Another source:     It is fitted with a rather unique fully-stabilized 152-mm gun-launcher capable of firing ordinary projectiles and MGM-51 Shillelagh anti-tank guided missiles.   And one more:     ""The other two relatively high tech systems on the Sheridan was a stabilized gun system and the XM44 gunners sight. The XM44 was an image intensification sight for the main gun. The fact that it was the XM44 meant that it was not type classified and still considered developmental. It was notoriously unreliable. The stabilization system was not very robust, and only worked on fairly level ground. Even then, the sight picture jiggled quite a bit and while it was much better than nothing, it was not very useful going cross country. On a range road it might allow on the move firing, but only on a flat road.""   If only there was official documentation on things like this. Seems rather odd they'd fire a 152 on the move in the first place if they ever wanted to hit something."
ArmoredWarfare,38qels,Gatortribe,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:51:30 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks for linking those sources!   One thing I'm also wondering about is how reliable the stabilization on the gun itself actually was - there's probably significant difference between purely mechanical and computer assisted systems.  I wouldn't be surprised if that aspect of tank warfare improved significantly in the last 30 years.    With a 152mm missile/gun launcher the Sheridan would turn a few heads, as it was capable of taking out any armor threat that passed through its sights. Coupled with a turret mounted .50 caliber machine gun and a 7.62 coax machine gun and a tank thermal sight (which was first used during Desert Shield/Storm) it had that instant firepower the infantry needed. The Sheridan was most impressive when it’s main gun fired. The first three road wheels would come off the ground, the gun-tube would extract back into the turret, a ball of dust & smoke would form in front of the tank and the 152mm round hitting it’s target. http://www.eaglehorse.org/4_ftx_gunnery/equipment/M551/sheridan_m551.htm#Part_7:_The_First_to_the_Fight   Can only imagine what that does ""on the move""."

For example, I suggested a while back that we switch its class bonus to a decreased penalty for driving off road, which I think would be suitable to the light tank role as well as its historical function.  In our current build, we've already made it less accurate, take longer to aim to minimum size, and increased the reload time.   There's a good chance we'll try switching the class bonus as well at some point, but we need to see how our current changes play out first.

ArmoredWarfare,38oboi,trobsmonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:31:12 2015 UTC,"Looks like they are adding in the expeditionary tank, Wonder if they will allow it to be playable.  I really don't think this is a great idea and is only going to lead to more trying to kill steal and more people whining about people doing the kill stealing.   New Feature - Kill Streaks  • When a player gets a kill, this increases the amount of Reputation the player earns from all damage dealt in the match.  • These bonuses are cumulative, but small enough that a player will not be rewarded for poor decisions (e.g. kill stealing rather than shooting a more dangerous target).   And here's another one that seems like a terrible idea that is only going to make people want to cap more than fight   New Feature - Base Capture Multipliers  • The Reputation and Credits earned from capturing an enemy base are now scaled based on the number of enemies alive at the time the base is captured. The more enemy players that are alive, the larger the bonus.  • This is to more heavily reward players who manage to accomplish epic base captures that decisively win the match, rather than just capturing a base with only one or two enemy stragglers alive.   These 2 reward features make me worried about the direction they are trying to take this game."
ArmoredWarfare,38oboi,Gatortribe,3,Fri Jun 5 14:49:30 2015 UTC,"In all my days of playing AW, I saw on two occasions people cap to win. Two times. People cap so many times less in this game and I didn't know why, mainly because there's no purpose and killing the enemy team made more sense in people's minds. Now there's an incentive."
ArmoredWarfare,38oboi,Hawks_Lead,2,Fri Jun 5 16:18:37 2015 UTC,I don't like the kill streak thing. Maybe only if the bonus kicks in after 3 or 4?   And I reallllllly don't like the base cap bonus.

ArmoredWarfare,38oboi,trobsmonkey,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:11:04 2015 UTC,"I'm Not too worried about the Kill Streak thing. It scales based on damage, so someone killing low health targets won't actually benefit as much than someone getting kills with lots of damage done."
ArmoredWarfare,38oboi,illusionalsagacity,0,Sat Jun 6 01:36:15 2015 UTC,"Ugh. This is the opposite of what they should do. Hunting those ""epic wins by capping"" is going to cause noobs to YOLO to the enemy cap and die, even more so than they already do.  If anything, they should show the capper in the end plate how much more xp they'd have gotten if they'd killed all of the enemy instead."
ArmoredWarfare,38oboi,trobsmonkey,2,Fri Jun 5 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"Something I hope they will do that WoT has never done is give EXACT values for xp. I like what they have now in the details screen, but expanding that to show how much xp you get from damage on certain tanks and kills on certain tanks would be awesome."
ArmoredWarfare,38oboi,illusionalsagacity,2,Fri Jun 5 15:37:50 2015 UTC,That's a tooltip in the details/summery view. http://i.imgur.com/fkKc8zO.png

ArmoredWarfare,38oboi,OfensiveBias,0,Fri Jun 5 16:32:56 2015 UTC,"I believe they stated the capping points are only awarded if you win the match by capturing the base. Even so, I agree with you. If they wanted a bonus to base capture, it should be a bonus based on how many tanks remaining on your team relative to the other team. So if it's a close game, little to no bonus. If you're at a disadvantage, you get a bonus. If your team has more tanks than the other team, there should be a small penalty imo, but that probably won't happen."

ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,trobsmonkey,3,Fri Jun 5 14:37:25 2015 UTC,"While we all eagerly await the start of Early Access 2, We thought we would share the preliminary patch notes with you.

New Feature - Spotting Streaks  • When a player spots another vehicle, the player gets a stacking bonus to the Reputation earned from damage dealt to vehicles the player is spotting.  • This is to help provide an additional reward for exceptional scouts.  New Feature - Base Capture Multipliers  • The Reputation and Credits earned from capturing an enemy base are now scaled based on the number of enemies alive at the time the base is captured. The more enemy players that are alive, the larger the bonus.  • This is to more heavily reward players who manage to accomplish epic base captures that decisively win the match, rather than just capturing a base with only one or two enemy stragglers alive.

ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,avalon304,2,Fri Jun 5 14:47:26 2015 UTC,I liked the formatting better. Same information on both sites is it that big of a deal?
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,bspooky,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:49:47 2015 UTC,"I struggle with this too but on Reddit linking to the original source content is in the Rediquettee which has a link to the right in the rules:  ""Look for the original source of content, and submit that. Often, a blog will reference another blog, which references another, and so on with everyone displaying ads along the way. Dig through those references and submit a link to the creator, who actually deserves the traffic."""
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,avalon304,2,Fri Jun 5 20:03:33 2015 UTC,Reddiquette are guidelines... not rules.
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,bspooky,-1,Fri Jun 5 21:41:26 2015 UTC,"Rule #1: Follow Reddiquette and Reddit's rules.   Perhaps in other subrredits what you say is true, but here in the Armored Warfare sub Rule #1 states FOLLOW the reddiquette, not pay attention to these guidelines, but it directs you to follow them. The way it is phrased it incorporates the guidelines into being the rule for this subreddit so they are no longer just guidlines, but rules themselves."
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,avalon304,2,Sat Jun 6 03:15:57 2015 UTC,Doesnt matter. Reddiquette is nothing more than a set of guidelines that do not need to be followed so long as the user in question isnt a massive douchenozzle.
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,bspooky,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:25:21 2015 UTC,"In your opinion it doesn't matter. If a rule tells you to follow something and you don't follow something, didn't you break that rule? Follow X is as clear cut as it can be that X is a rule on THIS subreddit.   Another example, if the rule says walk on the right hand side of the sidewalk and you walk on the left becauses it is a sidewalk and there is room, how you can you say you didn't violate the rule?  If you have a college professor say in his/her class the rule is you follow the apa style guidliens and you don't, you instead go by some other set of guidlines that contradict APA style, what do you think your grade is going to be? Will you be able to argue effectively you shouldn't have to follow the guidlines because they are just guidlines and not a rule?  We can agree to disagree, but nowhere in the wording of Rule#1 does it indicate it is optional for people to use reddiquette...it mandates you do if you want to conform to the rules of THIS subreddit. Otherwise the person writing the rules would have used a different term or phrase if it was merely a suggestion or reinforcment."
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,OtterTenet,2,Sat Jun 6 03:45:42 2015 UTC,"Another example, if the rule says walk on the right hand side of the sidewalk and you walk on the left because it is a sidewalk and there is room, how you can you say you didn't violate the rule?

Again: Stupid rules are made to be broken.   Otherwise the person writing the rules would have used a different term or phrase if it was merely a suggestion or reinforcement.   Have you read the rules? Because I'm pretty sure whoever wrote them just found a boilerplate set of rules for a subreddit and copypasta'd them... because Rule 8 has exactly 0 place on this subreddit... And rule 3 isn't exactly enforceable now is it?  Its been my experience on most subreddits that the 60% of the rules just exist for no other reason than to exist, and because the mods like to make up silly rules.  Also: Rule 2 is in direct conflict with Rule 1... so I'm really not putting any faith in those rules, or the person/people that came up with them. And that's all I'm gonna say on this."
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,bspooky,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:58:09 2015 UTC,"A lot of your argument continues to be opinion...rules are stupid therefore not applicable or meant to be broken. Really whether you believe the rules are stupid or not is irrelevant when determining if they are rules or not. The Reddiquette guidelines for reddit overall are either a rule on this particular sub by what rule 1 states or they are not. That is all I am addressing with your comment above. Thoughts or feelings on whether the rules are stupid or not don't matter. If you think those thoughts do matter, have fun telling that to a judge if you break those pesky rules called laws and get caught.   Rule 8 having a place or not on this sub also doesn't matter in the discussion of if rule 1 makes the Reddiquette a rule set, but just quick examples where rule 8 may be needed is if somebody decides porn models look great photoshopped onto AW tanks? Or shock images....did you see this photo of the Abrams blown up with all the intestines hanging out of the hatch? They need that in the game! Although I agree with you, the rules were probably from a boilerplate, but neither of us know for sure.   Just because rule 2 is a subset of rule 1 doesn't void or negate it as being in conflict. Redundant? Yes. But Rule 2 is pretty much how you were interpreting Rule 1 to start. Is Rule 2 needed with Rule 1 there? Nope, other than the reinforce the ""play nice everybody"" mentality for people who don't get or understand that rule 1 is saying you must follow the Reddiquette as rules. ;) Can you comply with rule 2 and run afoul of rule 1? Sure. But so what? I can comply with rule 2 and run afoul of other rules too. No direct conflict, just a super-set and subset or nesting relationship, something you see in policies, rules, procedures, and laws all the time. You can comply with rule 1 all day long and never need worry about rule 2.  In the end this discourse was started by you saying that the Reddiquette is a guideline, not a rule. Yet you have now admitted Rule 1 makes the Reddiquette into Rules to be followed on this sub (otherwise why would you say rule 2 conflicts with it?). It has been a fun discussion!!!  Cheers.  :)"

Where do you see formatting constitutes its own unique content, or as a moderator is that the rule you are making here? If it is, that is fine it is your house, but couldn't that then just be used by any blog that links to another blog that links to another blog as an excuse to drive traffic to their site instead of the original content owner? They ""reformatted"" the content, therefore it is their own? Simple reformating doesn't seem to be a new derivative.   I am not trolling, nor do I have anything against either ""labs"" which makes the rest of your post make me scratch my head and ask where that came from. Perhaps my comments were not the target. But as I said at the start of this subthread, I struggle with knowing what is ok to link to and what is not ok to link to. The Reddiquette seams quite clear, link to the original content when it is readily available."
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,OtterTenet,3,Sat Jun 6 13:21:10 2015 UTC,Just because something can be used poorly doesn't mean it has to be completely banned.  The rule is going to be reviewed in a case by case basis. Raising hysteria over a link to ArmoredLabs with a formatted Patch Notes seems over the top.
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:44:04 2015 UTC,"OtterTenet, gauging by your past posts on other forums and not being afraid to speak your mind.... if you read on the AW forums or anywhere else that a moderator said the rules are going to be reviewed on a case by case basis, which can easily be interpreted as the rules are going to be arbitrarily applied on a case by case basis, I would think you would raise a stink about that and feel you are going to be censored if you don't agree with the mods.  But that point aside, rules are there to guide people's behavior, and applying them sometimes but not consistently causes confusion. I have seen threads on Reddit deleted because they didn't link to the original content. What happens in other subs may not matter, but I could have sworn this issue has come up here before with the mods frowning on not linking to original content.   You seem to believe the reason for bluenosedcoop first questioning this post and myself for what I thought was being helpful to trobsmonkey as a clarification on the rule 1 / etiquette as being about a hit attack on the labs forum themselves. From my perspective where the link went to has no relevance towards the discussion that followed about the Reddiquette, and as stated I have no problem with the labs and used wotlab a lot. So this could have been a link to any site and I would have had the same response to help...maybe I shouldn't do that. Yes, avalon304 and I were going back and forth but I am surprised people were even paying attention. I apologize if that went on too long, he/she and I should have taken that offline in retrospect.   Similarly, you and I can take this offline if you wish to discuss this further.But it is even more unlcear now to me than before when linking to something from this sub what is acceptable and what is not."
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,BooMsx,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:48:52 2015 UTC,"Rules are being applied arbitrarily on the AW forums, and people are being silenced based on moderator whim.   On Reddit, the the Subscribers determine what content gets promoted to the top and what gets removed. If you feel like something doesn't contribute, you press the downvote arrow.  If you want to treat the Reddiquette as strict rules, and you want to follow those rules explicitly (?!) then this particular case is clearly not a ""blog linking to a blog linking to a blog"". It's a Forum Post linking to the Original, and improving on it's formatting. Not strictly equal.   If you aren't being strict, then you are performing a case by case analysis.   So what should we do?  According to ""Rule"" #1 on Reddiquette - we should be human and adapt to the situation.  In the majority of cases, just like with this one, the community will have it's say. Good content will hopefully rise to the top, and bad content will sink."

ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,OtterTenet,2,Fri Jun 5 21:13:21 2015 UTC,I really hope they hold out on giving everyone the expeditionary tank (they said everyone will have something in their garage). Most people don't have tier 5s let alone 6. I disliked how they handed out tanks before people got to that tier in the last test.
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,Gatortribe,-1,Fri Jun 5 22:14:19 2015 UTC,The point of EA atm is to test progression and report bugs. Handing out premium tanks helps with that. Not everyone plays every single test day for the allotted hours. Just saying.
ArmoredWarfare,38oa3i,illusionalsagacity,3,Sat Jun 6 01:43:09 2015 UTC,"They shouldn't hand out a tier 6 tank until 60% of the server has tier 6.

Oh no.   So, really what I think you're getting at here, and excuse me for being rude, is that you want to keep your ""progression"" because it makes you feel as if you have achieved something others have not? It's getting wiped once open beta hits if not before then anyway. Giving everyone a tier 6 premium vehicle helps everyone accrue global XP and more credits allowing them to progress through the dealer tech tree faster. How does it not? LoL.  Let's not forget we don't even know how easy/fast or slow/hard progression will be with the XP/credit updates not to mention a tier 7 is roughly 6 million credits to purchase now and the tier 3 went up 100k, so on and so forth. So people may not even hit tier 7 before the end of the next test in reality.  Anyway, whether they do it or not isn't ultimately up to you. And if they do release the vehicle(s) no amount of whining is going to rectify nor stop them from doing so, because they see it fit to release it. Instead, focus on things that matter. Like balance changes, and HUD improvements rather than whether or not they're going to negate everyone's progression. It's worthless anyway - you got to tier 5 in alpha, and tier 6 in early access. So what? Want a cookie?"
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,Bluenosedcoop,3,Thu Jun 4 17:56:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry if the formatting seems weird, on my mobile.  I think one of the factors is how armor at teirs 1-4 is almost pointless. Not saying it doesn't work sometimes but the only tank at teir 4 I had a problem penning at most ranges was a T-64, and even then only when I didn't take the extra second to aim for a weak spot. The only time I was having a hard time penning a tank was when I faced the few M60A3s, it was damn near a culture shock to feel almost helpless going toe to toe with one (with my Leo 1) until I just said ""screw it"" and shot the 0 armor gun mantlets.  At first I thought it was broken for a tank to have that kind of armor, but then I saw what someone could do with it. They can push or even break a flank in one of those (with some support as well). That's what a MBT should be doing, that's their strength. They weren't impossible to deal with either, but it took some coordination to stop it. That's where I feel the strengths of other vehicle classes will come into play in the later teirs. I'm hoping once more people have MBTs thank can reliably shrug off a few shells the momentum of the match can move a little more.  I'm not saying it's perfect but I want to see what the teir 5-7 tanks can do before passing a final judgement."
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,Noveas,2,Fri Jun 5 03:41:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the role of armor in this game is my biggest concern right now. I get that armor became less important when the Germans starting with the Leo line began focusing more so on mobility and firepower. But this game wasn't really designed to be a simulator, not with the way Abrams which can shoot from a few kilometers in real life are severely limited in their range in this game. I'm really hoping Obsidian makes armor a key strength for the MBTs we're getting."
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,imaginary_num6er,3,Fri Jun 5 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"I think there are a couple of issues outside of poor map design that encourages camping.   MBT Armor: Either they need to add active/passive defensive mechanisms at lower tiers, or they need to buff the armor on MBTs. Even enabling smoke would be better than the current state. If the only reliable means of avoiding penetration damage is via long-range and camouflage, then there's sure as hell no reason why the MBTs need to move up to get sniped by invisible tanks. When was the last time you've ever heard of people ""aiming for weak-spots"" in this game on a MBT? The answer is never. TD Experience: If there is a game mechanic forcing players to snipe at 300+ meters range to earn experience towards tank destroyers, then people will certainly be forced to do it. No one is going to shell real cash just to avoid earning experience by shooting from long range. View Range: There needs to be a mechanic where firing for prolonged periods of time at long range will negative impact your camo-rating to the point, where MBTs that are at least stationary will be able to spot you. In WoT, there were only a few TDs that have enough camo and view range to consistently shoot from one location without being detected. For example, the S35 CA and Hellcat were tanks that had superb view ranges and camo ratings, but both had disadvantages with the former having a terrible turn-rate, aim time, and acceleration speed; and the latter having a limited shell-count and sub-optimal DPS rating. Both of these mechanisms reined in the damage potential of these tanks, which required them to move around to some extent. In AW, there is nothing limiting your DPS as long as you're not spotted."
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,Gatortribe,6,Fri Jun 5 03:24:05 2015 UTC,"River Point is the problem really. It actually rewards base campers. You can shoot people on the 1/2 line, in the center town, AND coming out of the 8 line! It's most evident on the north side.   As a little experiment last night, me and my platoon decided to camp our north spawn on River Point. The result? We ended up with 10 kills between us and about 8000 combined damage."
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,Gatortribe,4,Thu Jun 4 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"River Point needs a good re-design and i wouldn't see a major problem with this base camping if it wasn't for the fact that it had started to happen on the other maps.  Cold Strike for instance i had seen many times over the past few days where 4-5 tanks from the North spawn were camped out basically right next to where they spawned at the northern side of the petrol station, Or Ghost Fields where the i had seen increasing amounts of times where the team on the East spawn had completely ignored going south and ended up with up to 10 tanks all sitting around the corner in the North East of the map.  It goes beyond map design when the same detrimental tactics/gameplay starts to happen on more than one map, And that's what makes many people think that it's more than just map design problems but also view range/spotting problems and not enough reward for attacking."
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,Gatortribe,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"I've only seen it on Cold Strike once (camping the base I mean, I've seen everyone pile up on I2 and do nothing more than a few times...). I drove through the town and saw literally nothing so when we got to their base, we ended up slaughtering them 15-1.   It's partially due to the spotting mechanics, yes, and also due to players being new to the game. We were like this in the first alpha, I remember all too well. Maybe they'll get a little better in the next session."

ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,respscorp,2,Thu Jun 4 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"It's not the tactic of someone who wants to win it's a tactic of someone who wants to get as much damage as possible for themselves.   If people consistently lose with this tactic, the issues here are twofold:   Either it's too profitable to use this tactic (despite losing) or people just don't know how to play yet and resort to not moving because getting shot is scary. It's not fun to fight against this tactic.   If I'm correct in evaluating the two issues listed above as the real issues behind your post, let me know, because your post does not make the underlying issues clear.  If the first problem is solved (making the strategy unprofitable), the second problem is a non-issue (since the tactic will no longer be used). Therefore, a strategy for the AW devs to use seems to be either to (1) reduce the rewards this sort of play gives, (2) further reduce the effectiveness of this tactic and its ability to gain rewards, (3) increase the rewards for winning, or (4) properly educate players to inform them that this tactic is ineffective.   Reducing the rewards given for camping would be fairly difficult. It's easy to assume that the campers are primarily gaining their rewards via damaging the enemy and, ultimately, damaging the enemy is something that should be rewarded. If enemies are capable of pulling high damage while using an ineffective strategy, then perhaps (2) is what we should look at. Nonetheless, it is true that certain vehicles are tailored for this sort of gameplay while other vehicles are not, so it is possible to penalize the rewards gained by certain classes of tanks who use this tactic while keeping the unique playstyle of other tanks unharmed. Reducing the effectiveness of this tactic's ability to gain rewards might make the most sense. In this case, assuming farming damage is where most of the rewards come from, changing the maps to make using this tactic to farm damage difficult seems like the clearest answer. There are alternate game mechanics that could be implemented to also punish this tactic, but map modification seems best without introducing needless systems. Something like making sure the high points on maps are closer to the center would be an easy way to disincentivize this tactic. Increasing the rewards for winning has some advantages and some disadvantages. Obviously, with more rewards from winning, people will be more motivated to actually try to win. However, in a game like AW, winning is not always determined by your actions. While a good player may be able to pull a 70% win rate because of his ability to impact a game, the fact of the matter is that 30% of the time the player will still lose and it may be no fault of his own. 30% is a high enough percentage such that it's entirely possible the good player in question could get on a losing streak as he's trying to grind a tank line and, given the increased rewards for winning (and the, by comparison, reduced rewards for losing), he may get very frustrated at his lack of ability to progress despite playing quite well. In addition, more casual players will be punished for not seriously working on their skills. Educating the players about the disadvantages of this tactic would only work if two things held true. First, the players must not already know that the tactic causes them to lose more than win (many of them may be aware but just want to sit back, relax, and farm damage) and second, the players must actually care about it (which is very unlikely to be the case). Therefore, I'd say more education is not a particularly valid solution to this problem.   The second solution seems like the best one. Map modification to make this tactic practically useless (camping low points isn't exactly going to get you damage) should both eliminate the primary issue and, hopefully, make teams who try to take the high points on the map and camp them a little more fun to play against, as you'll have more options (approaching from multiple angles, trying to beat them to the high points before they're fully set up, etc). It would also allow tanks who excel at the sniping role to still have a place; it may just take a little more skill for them to execute their tactics effectively, which is hardly a bad thing. This could also be a game mode change; if the capture points were closer to the center of the map and hidden from sniping spots near spawn it would allow a team facing a camping team to simply ignore them and win the game without much trouble."
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,Trigonix,2,Thu Jun 4 21:19:04 2015 UTC,"It's primarily the map designs, with a good chunk from the lack of scout education.  People need to be rewarded more for assists than damage on scout vehicles, and tutorials needs to be released for proper scouting runs.   Too many protective hull down spots and dominating heights near cap circles on maps - especially in River Point."
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,SkinnyPenguin,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:34:14 2015 UTC,"The issue is manyfold. For example, the fact that leaving the base without AFV screening results in hasty death contributes to it.  But the main contributor is the game mode. All maps at the moment copy the WOT model of base capture + deathmatch, with no respawns. Leaving the base is actively discouraged by this. Spreading out doesn't just make you a more likely to die without contributing to the match, it opens up the base to AFV rush.  If the maps were instead more inspired by domination type mechanics, sitting in your spawn would still be an issue, but at least it would be actively disincentivised by the game - anyone sniping from spawn will not be contributing to securing the strategic points spread around the centre of the map."
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,Ukiah,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:19:59 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna tell you why I stay close to the base on Riverpoint in my Sheridan: First of: I can load an ATGM and help out the time while shooting enemies +500 meters away. I can fire at tanks moving in the open towards the base. After a little while the game has developed, I leave the ""tactical spot"" and go around finishing the enemy tanks, or hold the off at the base. This tactic works 9 of 10 times.  But of course I'm not talking about a T-62 or something like that sitting in base without any ATGMs."

ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,OtterTenet,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:45:51 2015 UTC,"WT's system provides the client with the location of all enemy assets any time they are in line of sight.  This means that the only way to hide is to be 100% behind hard cover (and in WT, a match with no Air assets).   Players are under the illusion that trees and partial cover can obscure their tank, but from the Game Client's perspective, they are always visible. The client modifies how the information is provided for the player.  This is where a relatively simple crack adjusting that information display can make enemy tanks light up like stars in the night, even if they are behind trees, and with a simple script, provide the lead indicator for shooting.  Being entirely client side, this can be very difficult to detect from the Server.   This can be done regardless of mode - providing a huge edge in Simulation / Hardcore mode.   This is why Hardcore modes are not practical - the server cycles and bandwidth required to simulate it properly without making it client-side are likely prohibitive.   The reason WoT went with their server side spotting system is precisely to avoid the hack vulnerability - and despite all the nasty tricks in that system (that may have been toned down in AW) - it's the best approach we have."
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,Ranger1Presents,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:55:08 2015 UTC,"The vulnerability of WT's spotting/camo system isn't a hack.  You have the ability to turn off foliage/haze within your own client.  In realistic and simulator mode that effectively removes any concealment from the map for you, and if your target has left it on (as intended) you have a huge advantage. No hack necessary, just put the game on ultra low settings and you are golden... a built in wall hack if you will. It's a shame they took a brilliant system and allow it to be turned off with a click."

In a decade or so perhaps that will change.
ArmoredWarfare,38jpi0,Ranger1Presents,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:00:23 2015 UTC,"Consider this Otter.  The vast (and I do mean vast) majority of WT players do so in arcade mode, where turning off concealment doesn't matter at all. They could easily disallow the option to turn off concealment in Realistic or Simulator battles, which would make the viable again.  You would be denying a miniscule portion of the player base the ability to play in those two more advanced modes (those who have PCs that MUST play on minimal settings), this is true.  But they would be opening those modes up to the huge number of players that do have a modestly decent computer who refuse to play those modes now because of the built in wall hack.  However, they are afraid of losing players, so instead they invalidate the two best modes their game has to offer... the very modes whose concealment mechanic made their game so unique... and lose far more players by doing so.  Gaijin logic, hard at work.  Regardless, the point was that the faults in WT's concealment system isn't a hack... it's simply a result of poor decision making on the part of the developers."

The presence of obscuring terrain elements IS their concealment system, alongside the removal of enemy team markers.  Since other games appear to be fully capable of preventing players from turning off crucial graphical element, your assessment would appear to be a inaccurate (no offense).

This game really rewards capturing enemy base because 1) maps are too big and terrains are too complex for moving back to defend; 2) huge money/reputation gain for cap; 3) you have to kill to reset rather than dealing damage; 4) exponential growth of capping speed with additional tanks on cap.   To some point I even think it is a sensible idea to have a couple of tanks camping at base just to make sure no sneaky rats could just cap to win. Maybe it's just me.

ArmoredWarfare,38h3ld,Gatortribe,7,Thu Jun 4 04:11:21 2015 UTC,"---this is quoted for people who don't want to log into forums--- M60A3 Preliminary Feedback- The Bully to End All Bullies By the end of Sunday, I had finally unlocked the M60A3. I've played it enough to get everything researched, I'm only 19,000 XP away from the Leopard 2AV (so I'll have it day 3 of the testing if the time frame is the same). I'll add my thoughts on it more in the next test when people start getting more tier 5s, as just auranight, gentlestraw, and iddqd (I probably butchered your name...) every few matches isn't enough.   My Stats  The DPG is admittedly underwhelming, but it's what happens when you have a Stingray and LAV-300 in your platoon- You win the flank and they get the rest of the damage.  The Gun  The Leopard 1 was godsend with that gun handling, the fact that it started aiming as soon as you decelerated. I was ready to give that all up for the sake of testing. Alas, I didn't have to. The gun handling on this tank is great. You can shoot while going 48kmh (the top speed) and hit anything medium range or closer 95% of the time. A very warm welcome after being extremely jealous of my friend's light tank bonus.   The penetration just adds on to the list of pros. The final APFSDS round has a staggering 404mm of penetration. Not as good as the Sheridan's, mind you. But it's enough for everything I've faced. Russian turrets? What armor? The T-72 stands no chance against this shell, you can send freedom straight through the turret (no, not the ""mantlet,"" the actual turret armor). It has a well sloped frontal plate though, surely 404mm pen can't do that? Nope, it can. Communist tanks can't stand up to the mighty Eagle shot. In fact, the Leopard 2AV has less penetration than this tank! Even the HEAT round (with all of its godforsaken mechanics) has 332 penetration.   Damage is meh, but if you're going up this line you shouldn't expect alpha. This tank will teach you how worthless alpha is anyway. Sure, Ivan in the 72 might be able to hit you for something over 500 (I can't remember the 72's damage). But who cares when you can pump 400 damage back into him every 6 seconds! At the moment I'm mainly fighting 3s and 4s so I'm doing more damage than them in less time. The HEAT round can do even more, with around 500 average damage. You don't sacrifice enough pen to make it useless either, you still have 332, more than enough for Russian turrets (although the 72's turret becomes tricky with it).  The one downside- I don't know what it is, I don't know what I've done wrong. Leopard 1s are my greatest enemies. Some how, some way I always bounce my first two shots or they'll fail to penetrate, or go straight through. I don't know how, but the Leopard 1 bounces more from this gun than the 64 does. Maybe the German god of RNG is smiting me for leaving the Leopard 1 for this tank.   The Armor  I'm not going too far in to this. As I stated before, this is preliminary, simply for feedback to the devs. My thoughts on armor are anything but final.   The M60 had great armor for tier 3. If you disagree, you either progressed too slowly and faced tanks that don't give two craps about your armor or you did it wrong. All you had to do was go back and forth and people would miss your lower glacis. I'm talking about the majority of the player base, most of us experienced players knew about the mantlet bug day one and just abused it.  Back on topic, the A3 finally gets armor again. After the Leopard 1 which pulls off troll bounces and not much more it feels nice to not have to depend on others to take the first shot. Tier 3s have no chance against it. Lower glacis isn't even a thing for them, although some 62s have managed to somehow. I'll give away the biggest secret (and probably regret it when I run into any of you)- the mantlet bug still exists in this, it's been around since the first alpha. When people don't shoot it, however, the armor works great. The only threats are Sheridans (the APFSDS rounds don't give a shit about your armor, they can point n click all day) or AMX-10Ps and LAV-150s with HEI. I struggled to pen Gentlestraw's M60A3 with the 404mm pen shell, meaning the other 5s will certainly struggle. Stingrays have grown accustomed to shooting low tiers and treat you the same- only to be met with repeated bounces until you rip them apart, but they can certainly pen you if they aim.  The armor on this tank promotes aggressive play. Sure you can use the accuracy to snipe, but it's a waste of XP. I use it to just push the flank without thinking while the campers get no damage.   The Mobility  It's an MBT. It's slow and loses all of its speed when it turns or runs over the littlest thing. All there is to it. The engine upgrades feel useless, your top speed is actually 40-42 despite what the stats say. Even running synthetic oil it was too slow.   Summary  This tank is great. The only thing it needs to be amazing is a mobility buff. Currently, there isn't much competition for it. The Chieftain has a hull that's virtually armor-less, and so is the turret without the armor upgrade (plus you can just shoot through the gun all day). The T-72's armor is an all around joke, the A3 just auto pens it every time. Anyone who says otherwise either owns it and is in the honeymoon phase with it, or they never saw it before and were too scared to try shooting center of mass on it (this is assuming it didn't get buffed, hard to tell when we haven't gotten any PATCH NOTES. Every T-72 I've seen so far has been penned by everything, Stingrays have no problem with it and they have less pen than the A3). The only threat it faced was the T-64A, the ender of all tanks; With that gone, it reigns king and is quite a pleasure to play. It's not extremely fun thanks to being so slow, but it's still pretty fun."

Skirmishing/flanking I tend to run into a sheridan or two which tends to end poorly if they can dodge around and dont let me just DPM them to death.  I'm really struggling with the Leo 1 and I really wanted to love it D:"
ArmoredWarfare,38h3ld,Constriction,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:36:39 2015 UTC,"You don't want to get into a brawling situation, you're going to lose those most of the time.  Even if you win, you come out worse for it.  You need to play more reserved.  Not necessarily sniping, but let others take the first hit, then poke out and shoot.  Use the good depression and small turret to peek over hills.  Learn the reloads of other MBTs and time your shots - your reload generally bests theirs.  The key thing about the Leopard is its agility, and the incredible gun handling.  Takes you half as long to get places, and half as long again to aim down."
ArmoredWarfare,38h3ld,Terrachova,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:44:55 2015 UTC,"I find it really hard to properly abuse like a T-62's reload, given that in almost all scenarios I've seen, there'll be 2-3 T62s stacked up on a corner, trading aggressively. Most of the people I've been platooning with are playing lights/AFVs so i'm not able to coordinate someone taking a hit and 2/3-for-1ing someone very well at all."
ArmoredWarfare,38h3ld,Constriction,0,Thu Jun 4 19:29:22 2015 UTC,"I know it sounds like a lame answer, but in cases like that... you should get yourself out of that situation.  The Leopard 1 doesn't do well in those situations - if your mates are in AFVs or Lights... stick with them instead.  The Leo has as much in common with an AFV as it does an MBT.  Don't play the T-62's game.  Oh, and sidescraping.  Actually pretty effective, if you're only fighting one tank."
ArmoredWarfare,38h3ld,Terrachova,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"I tend to not have too many problems 1v1, definitely more the group-trading type environment. The big thing for me is just the vulnerability to HEAT that the Leo has, especially compared to the M60 at the previous tier. You go from being pretty safe from HEAT rounds to it seems like fairly autopenned. A snap or two and you're already down an insane amount of HP. Add in the (in my experience) unreliable turret models during this last test, where you will see the turret/gun facing one direction while in reality it's pointed directly at you, and it was fairly easy for me to lose a decent chunk of my HP for not very much advantage.   I'm pretty sure it's mostly down to me still being unfamiliar with specific mechanics between WoT and AW"

We're definitely aware of the major issues people are talking about (the Sheridan being OP, HE autocannon shells, the spotting system being weird, poor hit feedback in some cases, all that fun stuff) and many of these things have been addressed at least to some extent.   The Sheridan, for example, was nerfed even before early access started, but those changes didn't get into the build the public has been playing - the public builds are always behind because we need time to QA and stabilize any build we're sending out to the players."

ArmoredWarfare,38ds2u,TheNovelNovelty,2,Wed Jun 3 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand the argument some people are making that arty SHOULD get less xp than everyone else.... why? How is it so intrinsically wrong for artillery players to be rewarded for good performance like everyone else? I mean the ammo, repairs, upgrades and higher tier tanks cost exactly the same as they do for everything else."
ArmoredWarfare,38ds2u,caboose309,6,Wed Jun 3 18:36:52 2015 UTC,Because being able to hit targets with absolutely no chance of retaliation is bullshit and not fun for the target. It's in general considered terrible game design just having them in there because giving one player the ability to damage and kill another player without the other player even having a chance to do anything about it is horrible for the one taking damage.
ArmoredWarfare,38ds2u,babau,2,Thu Jun 4 01:31:22 2015 UTC,"You can do lots of things to not get shot by arty. You can move after you get spotted, you can move after you get the warning that arty is aiming at you, you can stay in an arty-safe spot (behind buildings, hills). You have to learn to play the game and not whine because you cant be bothered."
ArmoredWarfare,38ds2u,caboose309,-2,Thu Jun 4 04:12:44 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but once you see the warning you are going to get hit, unless the arty misses by accident.

ArmoredWarfare,38ds2u,babau,3,Thu Jun 4 04:24:43 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you're talking about WoT unicums?  Well sorry, but their experience in that game, especially considering arty means absolutely NOTHING here. Completely irrelevant because it's a different game.  I watched Quickybaby's impressions and while I respect his opinion in WoT he has no fucking clue what he's talking about in AW. I actually played artillery and played against artillery and all the complaining he did was factually incorrect horsecrap.  You are of course welcome to think it should get cut from the game but I very much doubt that will happen. So while you try to push your WoT related agenda, I chose to give feedback on how to make it better so it doesn't end up like WoT."

I completely agree with you about arty, as it is now it will not last after release, if that long. People are playing arty just to test it, nobody will try to get really good at it. I also believe that arty should get pinged on the map when its shell hits, not when firing, that's how CB works in real life ( direction and angle of the shell reveal firing position)."

So while you try to push your WoT related agenda, I chose to give feedback on how to make it better so it doesn't end up like WoT.   Keeping arty is more of a WoT agenda than removing it. We don't need a whac-a-tank minigame and arty-v-arty CB minigame in what is a very fast paced and fun direct fire game. Arty does have a place in PvE, it will allow the average to below average players to contribute to completing the objectives without having to brawl."
ArmoredWarfare,38ds2u,Zakreon,0,Thu Jun 4 13:54:33 2015 UTC,"I don't see what the problem here is, you are devaluing spotting a lot for some reason. The damage is good yes, but without those players spotting for you then you would be doing nothing, and they receive exp for assisting your damage.  Lets say that there is one tank on the enemy team, and a player on your team spots him for you and does 0 damage while sit back and kill him. Doesn't it make sense that the exp gets evenly split between the two? One can't work without the other"
ArmoredWarfare,38ds2u,VoteRonaldRayGun,8,Thu Jun 4 04:22:49 2015 UTC,"you are missing the point.  I am not saying reward spotting less (hell no I'm an AFV player I want that juicy spotting money :D) I am saying artillery never spots so you're just automatically rewarding them less by design... artillery, if it's part of the game deserves to be rewarded for good artillery play like everyone else. Good artillery play just doesn't happen to include spotting and I've gotten top team spots in scouts for doing barely any damage purely on spots while I have NEVER gotten to the top 5 in artillery no matter how much i contributed... don't tell me that isn't wrong."
ArmoredWarfare,38ds2u,Tang0Three,-1,Thu Jun 4 10:42:02 2015 UTC,"But how can you boost their rewards? They inherently do less in a game than other tanks. They aren't spotting, they aren't attracting shots, they aren't capturing bases. All they can do is shoot over buildings. If you do enough damage then your going to get a lot of exp, but since that's the only way you can contribute to a win at all I dont see any way they should receive more exp"
ArmoredWarfare,38ds2u,goodoldxelos,3,Thu Jun 4 11:03:44 2015 UTC,as I just said I have played games in scouts where I literally did no damage and only feasted off of spots and still topped the board... how is that ok when the reverse isn't ok?

The PT-91 is of course is based on a licensed T-72M1.  Still I'd find the the T-55M8A2 Typhoon most amusing.

At the most, they should just put the regional variations into the upgrade list of that tank. So you can upgrade your Leo to the Canadian spec or whatever.

ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Salaris,3,Wed Jun 3 06:28:28 2015 UTC,"Writing that up on the feedback forums is a good idea. Unfortunately, UI indicators aren't really my department."
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Benjaminschiff,3,Wed Jun 3 06:46:08 2015 UTC,"Are vehicles going to be able to use ATGMS without constantly reloading them when they switch to them? BMD-1 Shouldn't have to reload its ATGM every time I switch to it... Also the Bradly has a two TOWs in the launcher, but must reload after the first shot. Is this going to be fixed? Has it been fixed and I just have not noticed? Thanks"
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Salaris,3,Wed Jun 3 10:23:11 2015 UTC,"We're working on making a system for switching between independent weapon systems without dealing with a full reload cycle.   It's going to be something we'll have to balance carefully, because being able to swap instantly could potentially offer those vehicles too much DPM potential, but the long cooldowns we're dealing with right now certainly don't feel right.  It's something we're working on and trying different ideas for."
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Bluenosedcoop,-1,Wed Jun 3 20:42:08 2015 UTC,Personally i don't mind the long reloads as it makes each ammo type choice matter and it also allows for easier balance rather than be able to blap out round after round.
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Salaris,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:47:01 2015 UTC,We definitely want to make sure each type of round has a clear role.
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Bluenosedcoop,-2,Wed Jun 3 23:00:59 2015 UTC,"That's a game balancing mechanic, You cannot have a tank unload all it's autocannon clip then instantly switch to a high dmg missile it would just create far too much burst damage."
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Benjaminschiff,3,Wed Jun 3 11:16:06 2015 UTC,"""You cannot have a tank operate the same way it does in real life because there isn't away to balance it"" This is what I heard"
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Bluenosedcoop,-5,Wed Jun 3 21:19:42 2015 UTC,"You read what you want to read clearly you have no intent of thinking with any common sense or logic.  In the end up it's a game, An arcade gameplay focused game at that, This is not a simulation, Balance has to be found and its a tough thing to do.  I would much more trust obsidian over some fool like you who refuses to understand what balance means."
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Benjaminschiff,2,Wed Jun 3 21:44:55 2015 UTC,"Well I'd like to be able to expect a missile launcher with two missiles, to be able to fire two missiles prior to reloading. I think that is a reasonable expectation :)"
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Thu Jun 4 10:38:56 2015 UTC,"But then those missiles would have to be balanced based on the fact that you can fire 2 of them meaning they would have to do lower damage so as not to make them overpowered, Again i think you're forgetting the fact that this is a game that requires balance between weapons, vehicles and their respective classes."
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Leonick91,2,Thu Jun 4 12:56:38 2015 UTC,"Or, you know, the more obvious way to balance being able to fire two missiles between reloads, increase the reload time."
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Whitedeath5,2,Thu Jun 4 20:35:15 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the forums didn't pick up the idea. Welp. At least I tried.
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Salaris,2,Wed Jun 3 18:03:56 2015 UTC,Good luck doing it. The swingfire is a VERY interesting tank and it would be awesome if it was more viable- it provides a very interesting and unique role in AFV's.
ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,Highw4ySt4r,2,Wed Jun 3 14:41:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. There are definitely some challenges with it, but I think it'll be tons of fun once we get some of the control issues hammered out."

ArmoredWarfare,38bol9,clierik,3,Wed Jun 3 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"It's because the rangefinder in this game doesn't account for the tank with the ATGM so you're actually aiming at the hill behind it. It isn't an issue with normal ATGM vehicles with the missle coming out of the barrel, however because the Swingfire uses the top-down attack, the line from the missile isn't the same line from the camera. I drew an example to my friends to show the issue when I was grinding it; finally finished it last night and it was such an annoying bug to play with. It's most noticeable at closer ranges, and can be overcome by being on much higher altitude than the target."

Things we have to consider is tier 8 is maximum in AW, even though tier 9 and 10 are planned, do not expect to see them anytime soon like within a year soon even. So the grind shouldn't exactly = WoT levels imo. We also have to consider that premium accounts will be a thing, buff consumables too that fit in the 4 consumable slot that may also buff exp on a specific tank too.   After playing for 1 week I do believe the rate should be increased, but not by a lot. Maybe 10% faster. Personally I'll be playing with a premium account and the idea of it going 35% faster (with a 10% buff and premium bonus) seems certainly quick enough. Though, more testing would of course be needed."

ArmoredWarfare,3898aa,JimLaheysLiverspots,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:15:17 2015 UTC,"One of my biggest complaints about WoT was the grind. Unless you wanted to spend a literal month of playing, you had to buy premium once you got past tier 6/7. While this is a free to play game, there should be limits. Lets hope they hammer out how much EXP it takes to unlock stuff versus how much you get by the time open beta comes. I want to be encouraged to get the premium, not feel forced."
ArmoredWarfare,3898aa,Natirs,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:28:23 2015 UTC,I think rep grind is okay because you are also unlocking multiple vehicles. Credit grind seems a little too low. But so far the low tier AW gameplay is a lot better than low tier WoT gameplay. So it's less important.
ArmoredWarfare,3898aa,Sisaroth,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:06:07 2015 UTC,I really don't care how long it takes. The gameplay isn't like WoT where you spend most of your time playing a tank that's mostly useless. All the tanks I've played in AW feel good straight off the bat even without any upgrades.
ArmoredWarfare,387wta,RickR13,3,Tue Jun 2 14:14:12 2015 UTC,"Nobody can answer this question because it depends how quickly Obsidian is able to address the bugs/issues and concerns of the community. There is still plenty of stuff being tested. Keep in mind this is actually Alpha still and even though most things if not everything is feature locked (complete assumption from my end), they still have a truly monumental amount of fine tuning to do.  These tests are helping them hammer down those numbers like progression speed, income rates etc. If I had to make a complete guess I'd say 4 or 5 before they start opening it up into something closer to resembling an open test. And I mean open only in terms of accessibility to those who've gained access by paying or invites, not publicly."

ArmoredWarfare,386jtx,ChakiDrH,2,Tue Jun 2 13:27:24 2015 UTC,Presumably so that they can get the best player population possible so they can see how the servers react.
ArmoredWarfare,386jtx,K1ttykat,3,Tue Jun 2 13:43:53 2015 UTC,"This is pretty accurate. Testing server stability is a big part of this, from my understanding. We also want as much concurrency as possible focused into specific periods to avoid agonizing queue times.   Finally, we also try to monitor these tests as directly as possible (meaning many of our testers have had the dubious honor of annihilating me in matches already), and smaller windows to test helps with that.  I'm not any sort of authority on this subject, just chiming in with my perspective on it. Personally, I'd love to get the servers running 24/7 as soon as possible, but it's not at all my call. =)"

ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,pyrosity,10,Mon Jun 1 16:07:47 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue is I don't feel like I'm driving a tank. Sure, it looks like a tank, and I don't have any real reference for what driving an actual tank feels like, and yeah it's on a screen, but it just doesn't feel quite right yet. Hopefully that changes.   I don't get the same satisfaction when I let off a shot, either; it feels...soft, if that makes sense.   And my frame rate but I'm sure they'll fix that, too.   Edit - pointing at a tank and having my cross hairs point to the sky when I zoom is always a good time."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,theycallhimthestug,2,Mon Jun 1 16:57:32 2015 UTC,"I could be very wrong, but that last point usually happens when next to a building.  It could very well be intentional to simulate the fact that the barrel would need to elevate or it would hit the building. Which I suppose is by far preferable to having it damaged if it hits a building."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Ranger1Presents,3,Mon Jun 1 17:13:38 2015 UTC,"Right, that's what I thought as well, and I could also be wrong but I think I tried it in the open to check and it still happened sometimes. I'm sure someone has the answer.   Regardless, WoT used to do that back in the day and since barrels don't sustain collision damage (right? Wrong?) I feel that for the sake of game play they should fix it."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,theycallhimthestug,2,Tue Jun 2 03:06:16 2015 UTC,"Actually its that the mouse is pointing at a point high on the building, such as the roof. The gun is trying to aim as high as t can to point at where the mouse wants it to"
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Zakreon,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:22:16 2015 UTC,"I definitely will take your word on that, I had only noticed it when coming up to the corner of a building.  It certainly makes playing peek-a-boo a challenge."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Ranger1Presents,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:37:24 2015 UTC,It's because he's aiming at a point on the building that is higher then the area he want's to point at. It's a problem with the perspective nothing more.
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Thirtyk94,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:52:59 2015 UTC,"I kind of feel like this too, I think it could be made much better with some good sound effects and screen effects."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,_FinnTheHuman_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"yeahp, the tank scale feels off, for comparison if you play war thunder the tanks ""feel"" like proper tanks(massive, lumbering) and you also get a feel for the size right off the bat. Maybe it's the zoom out camera but even when zoomed at turret level the tanks feel small and toy-like.  Also, the grind.. the grind IS real... getting to tier 3 is relatively fast, easy and fun, and that's it, on tier 3 you hit an impassable grindwall, either the game is giving too few credits or too little xp or both, but 3->4 is awful (i've played since friday on tier 3, last night i barely managed to buy the M109, but still didn't had enough XP to unlock the T64, and this was only playing ONE dealer, thus maximizing my gametime)"
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Eliminateur,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:56:17 2015 UTC,This is one of my complains as well although mine is more about shooting and getting shot.    I don't know if it's the sounds or visible feedback but hitting an enemy tank and getting hit by one just feels soft.
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,TransparentTape,12,Mon Jun 1 20:39:00 2015 UTC,Maps are a bit too small. Wooden/metal poles & chicken wire fences soaking up tank shells. Random lag spikes. Teamkillers. HE ammo for auto cannons needs reworking. Still haven't unlocked my Chieftan Mk 5 yet. Siemka PL players
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,SturmWolf88,6,Mon Jun 1 19:21:38 2015 UTC,Getting owned by players who haven't played the game nearly as much as I have. =(
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Salaris,11,Wed Jun 3 06:19:55 2015 UTC,"For me it has to be the capability jump from tier 2 to tier 3. Pitting autocannon mounted tin cans against MBTs sits fairly high in the ""not fun"" camp. Not only that, but tier 1 can see tier 3, which is not possible in WoT."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,zach9889,8,Mon Jun 1 16:26:53 2015 UTC,"I think you're selling autocannons short. Even against MBTs, they can be very effective with HE spam - as long as you know how to play range and camo games. It doesn't seem like you're doing much when you're plinking away at them for 80-120 every time they poke, but that chip damage is going to quickly stack up. Late-game, when targets start getting low, you become capable of ambushing and one-drumming them (make sure you target designate them when you do). I only use AP when I know I'm going to get in a duel with another AFV, and carry 130 rounds for that purpose.  Point being, I actually had the exact opposite reaction as you. I was averaging 1500+ damage per game with them, and commented to the friend that I was playing with that I was surprised the low tier tanks were so viable against the higher tiers. It was a nice contrast to being bottom tier and unable to pen anything unless I slung gold, and even that being a dicey proposition.That being said, I'm a very experienced light/medium driver in WoT, and only got caught out early once in two dozen games or so with them last night. Just remember - like in WoT, the value of view range and mobility goes up significantly in the late game. Contribute as actively as you can early, but stay alive."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Siriothrax,2,Mon Jun 1 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"I carry 10% of my ammo in HE just out of habit, but I don't think I have ever actually loaded it in battle. I was thrown off by the fact that it does much less damage on the stat card, I'm used to it doing high damage if it pens and almost nothing if it doesn't.  Is HE in this game doing the rated damage against frontal armor? I expected it to be best versus very weak armor, but once I realized AP or HEAT is better vs light armor I never bothered with it. In an autocannon vs an MBT, I just flank it."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,TheDecoyTV,4,Mon Jun 1 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"The high explosive mechanic isn't quite like world of tanks. You will always do some damage with HE. You will do more to weakly armoured sections. You won't get full damage unless you pen. With an autocannon, that makes it a reliable source of chip damage, punishing mbts for being indecisive. You're still not gonna be ""raping"" a push as it advances, but if they keep exposing and let your dot stack up, they'll feel it.  Ammo goes like so: Use AP and its variants against anything you can pen. However, if your penetration is too high, you may over penetrate the target. If that's happening, switch to HEAT. It is lower pen but higher damage, and is fantastic against light opponents. However, it doesn't do guaranteed damage and can be defeated by ERA. As mentioned, use HE on things you can't pen.  With autocannons, I bring 150 or so ap and 650 he. Mbts and others, 70/20/10 ap/heat/he."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Siriothrax,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"That is good info. Still a little confused though, an LAV-150 with the 25mm vs another LAV-150, HE should be penning and doing full damage since it has basically no armor correct? But the AP does more damage according to the stat card, or does AP over pen often enough to make the HE better?"
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,TheDecoyTV,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:57:34 2015 UTC,"LAV vs LAV, I think the rounds are something like 18 damage for HE, and 25 or so for AP. So you can see that AP would be more, even if both are penetrating"
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Siriothrax,2,Mon Jun 1 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"i can attest that the autocannons can RAPE heavily armored targets with HE right now (even on their most heavily armored zones).  It takes quite a lot of shots, but they can do it with relative safety due to spotting mechanics in certain situations."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,mrnuknuk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:47:58 2015 UTC,"The time it takes to get from tier to tier jumps exponentially. To get to tier 7, we're going to need 90,000xp."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Gatortribe,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:16:06 2015 UTC,"There's a 4 tier spread, which WoT had for a long time before making it a 2 tier spread."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,intank31,3,Mon Jun 1 16:38:29 2015 UTC,Some Heavies had a 4 tier spread early on in WoT. Everything else was +-3.
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,zach9889,6,Mon Jun 1 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"The worst things by far are the Maps.   Not just that they aren't symmetrical - I can accept that at times, it's the fact that they are not sufficiently thought out and fire-lane checked.   For example:   The new river map has defensive heights with rock protection on the south side that cover the entire map - offering shots into the city, into the directly opposite push, and into the exists from the highway pass.   That domination of the 2 line translates into the domination of the entire west side of the map - offering even more shots into the city and all key lane exits.   The North side does not have nearly the same positions on the 2 line, often having to surrender it, and the heights the North base does offer are offset to the East and offer far worse fire coverage.  Overall the concepts of a bowl map with snipers hiding in the hills around is rather questionable.     This is just one example, and the maps are so finely detailed and finished there is no sense of ""Testing"" to them - they look final.  This means that any effort in changing them will have to be highly popular, and the masses of players don't understand the deep implications of the issue. It's unlikely to cause the type of feedback intensity that inspires resource allocation.  So far we've seen no indication that even a single map will be Symmetrical, as a nod to competitive players and potential league play. That is also quite worrying.  Balance issues and Bugs will be naturally resolved - but Maps are the heart of Tank gameplay and the slowest and most difficult to change. Their visual quality is amazing. Their gameplay quality is questionable. It's a bad trend."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,OtterTenet,3,Mon Jun 1 21:42:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the mouse sensitivity, although as an FYI you can lock your cross hair on the target with a right click on the target.  As with all auto aim features though, it's only useful if they are standing relatively still.  Also agreed on the water issue, although that doesn't bother me too much.  There is a bit too much grinding (particularly for cash) between tier 2 and tier 3... although that might just be an issue for Sophie's line of vehicles.  The MM needs work (too big a spread), and of course certain vehicles are badly in need of balancing or re-tier (Sheridan, I'm looking at you).  For this stage in development though, they seem to be in pretty good shape as most of these issues are fairly minor... as long as they actually DO get addressed."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Ranger1Presents,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think the 2-3 grind is really that bad, I got to the M60 in about 4-5 hours."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Legogeek14,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"Well, the grind to just ""unlock"" the M60 wasn't too terribly far out of line (still a bit long for that low a tier though)... however the real grind came in trying to earn the 20k to pay for it.  I'm not saying drastic changes are needed, but it seems a bit long compared to the competition. Or perhaps I just suck at making money.  :D  But truth be told I haven't had that issue in any of the other tanks to anywhere near that degree."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Ranger1Presents,3,Mon Jun 1 20:14:00 2015 UTC,"The Sheridan. The Light Tank bonuses are ridiculously overpowered. Not having to stop to aim?! Wth?! The broken/unfinished/nonsensical spotting/camo system. The fact that too little skill is involved in fights. There's no skillful angling making you able to outplay a worse guy in a similar tank. Chances are you'll both penetrate every hit. It especially hurts MBT fighting in cities etc. The complete lack of balance between different tank types. In a game like WOT a really good player in a AMX 1390 or whatever can still outplay and win against the odds even if he's up against heavies. Here, some of the scouts are just hopelessly bad against MBTs and will have to be 10 times better players to save a bad games after their failure team suicided. MBTs also don't stand a chance if they're alone against something like a Sheridan. They simply won't see him so no skill in the world can save them. Tanks should not decide the outcome of the game imo. Skill should. Lack of customization and feeling of progress on certain tanks. Some tanks have a lot of stuff to upgrade and add while others hardly have anything at all meaning you'll get no feeling of progress."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Dnarg,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:40:29 2015 UTC,"Angling is realistic, since APFSDS doesn't care about angles IRL."

ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Chalureel,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:48:03 2015 UTC,"A lot early MBT's only have APDS, which isn't that effective against slopped armour.  Angling also works in WoT in spite of WW2 AP behaving the opposite of what they did in reality; AP should penetrate less than LoS not more. The normalization value for AP in WoT is so high (5 degrees min, multiplies with overmatch) that most modern APFSDS rounds would not achieve a similar result.  For example against APFSDS 100 mm @ 60 degrees (200 mm LoS) is only 196 mm effective.  However because of WoT's unrealistic super AP, the same plate would only be 174 mm effective."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,LeuCeaMia,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:59:10 2015 UTC,"It's not a simulator. It's an arcade game.  If there's nothing you can do with your armor, you remove skill from the equation, which I see as a 100% bad design for a PvP game."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Dnarg,3,Wed Jun 3 10:23:11 2015 UTC,"This might be something I might be a minority on, dunno, I'm only in the very early tanks.  I'm not a huge fan of the steering or the sense of scale. Maybe my opinion will change when I get my first MBT, but I feel like I'm driving toys around.   tank controls in wot are called arcadey for a ton of reasons, but one of them is how steering input is set up. in wot, it's instant. in AW, it feels like there is an acceleration component to the steering. I don't have a well formed opinion on wheeled vehicles, so maybe this doesn't apply, but in the early tracked vehicles I didn't enjoy it. it made controlling the tanks feel mushy. for the speed of the m113, it meant I had to think about steering more than I typically have to in WoT. It's not a deal breaker, but I'm looking forward to trying other tanks. This isn't to say that I enjoy WT's driving any more, I'm tired of sliding so much.  The sense of scale is a little weird. I think others might have mentioned this. Maybe the animations and the camera configuration have a lot to do with it, I dunno. I enjoy that war thunder lets me appreciate the art assets and feel as close to the tank as possible, and I don't really like how wot's camera never lets me get a great look at my tank.  I know this is an early access thing, but beyond just typical lag problems that show up in young systems I've noticed that my projectiles take a long time to show up when I'm firing. When I'm firing on the move they show up like 10 meters behind me, and when I'm firing from a stand still I think the amount of leading I need to put in is excessive, and this is with a consistent 80-90 ping."

ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Leonick91,2,Mon Jun 1 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"Mouse sensitivity.  Some terribly unbalanced and unrealistic tanks(Sheridan).

Other than that - the fact that (like a lot of these comments are saying) tier 2's are useless against tier 3's.  And general performance issues, sound glitches, and I'd love for there to be better gun sounds (I hate that guns make a ""Whoosh"" sound even when they're fired right next to you).  Edit: Oh! And sometimes the spotting mechanics seem really fecked up, I've been killed by an AMX 10p while in my T-62 when it caught me poking out of cover (my turret was out of cover) and it started unloading into my tracks with HE - it kept me tracked and eventually killed me, all the while remaining unspotted. (An isolated incident, but I feel it shouldn't have been able to happen really)"
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,_FinnTheHuman_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:56:05 2015 UTC,"This is likely because only your front or rear drive wheel was exposed, you don't spot from this point. You spot from the commanders hatch and if something is blocking line of sight between your turret and a target you can't see it even if it's pumping shots right into your tracks. Annoying but not exactly broken."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Alazais86,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:23:34 2015 UTC,"Like I said, my turret was out of cover and therefore had line of sight to who was shooting me"
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,_FinnTheHuman_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:44:43 2015 UTC,"possibly but this happened to me on the C130 map yesterday where i went east.  2 AMX 10p were in the back both firing full automatic.  I was hull down, they could barely see my turret.  I could see all of the tracers going to a bush where both tanks were laying into me but was unable to spot them.  Blind firing seemed ineffective.  Also, they were penning me.  it's a 20mm gun shooting HE rounds that have 23 mm of pen and do 30 damage or something, how is it they are able to do so much damage?  Seems like their HE should be hitting me for nothing, as they will never penetrate.  Maybe break some modules?  But they killed me from full health and were never spotted.  Also, lack of hit decals.  You get shot and i am used to WoT where i spin arounda nd see where i was exposed and got hit, see which part of me was exposed, but this game doesn't appear to have them?  Or they are really limited"
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,mrnuknuk,2,Mon Jun 1 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that HE doesn't have to penetrate to do ""some"" damage.  The raw amount that gets through may need to be tweaked a bit... I wouldn't think too much though.  I tend to agree on the spotting mechanics and I think that perhaps there is room for some discussion with Obsidian about how they work.  Specifically, my opinion is that any time a vehicle fires a weapon it's should become visible to all within line of sight and/or the smoke from it's weapon should be clearly visible around/above it regardless of other vehicles view range. There are probably better resolutions to the issue, but that's what comes to mind right off the bat."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,Ranger1Presents,2,Mon Jun 1 20:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, but w/ 1063 HP in a T-62, hitting my thickest armor, with a round that does 30 damage, you would think it would take a while to kill me.  They obliterated myself, and two T-64s in about a minute of focus fire, just on hull down/turreted tanks.    I'm sure it will be tweaked.  I remember in WOT when shermans w/ the HE derp could go against tier 8s and consistently rack up thousands of damage due to HE handling.  I think WoT handles HE pretty well (maybe it could be a little stronger?  but it's OK) so I hope that it ends up being tweaked down a bit.  I'm not expecting my MBT to be an unstoppable force, but they should be scouting me so i get arty/missiled down, and occasionally flanking and lighting up my weaker armor.  shrug"

In wot, I have no doubt when my tank is penetrated/hit, or if I penetrate another tank, based solely on the boom when my tank takes a shot (or is tracked), or the guy announcing ""penetration!"" when I tag the enemy. Its not uncommon that I get blown up in AW not knowing that I was even being hit. The environment sounds - jets flying, helicopters, tracer bullets - all seem to have more sound definition than my own tank getting hit.   Also, there is no sound indicator for the ""sixth sense"" function of being spotted. In Wot, rarely do I visually see the indicator, but I know when I've been spotted ""It's a trap!"""

ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,caleel,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:11:00 2015 UTC,"What I don't like if that you have to constantly keep your mouse on the enemy tank to have it light up which makes leading a bit of a pain. There was multiple times where I spotted a light tank going at full speed and I tried leading him to only have him go dark again until I put my mouse over him then he was ""Highlighted"" even though he was spotted the whole time.  Also whenever I'm zoomed out and want to zoom in the sniper camera is always aiming upward and i have to find my central target again. It's annoying when I'm fighting a tank then I zoom in and have it aim upward.  Edit - to add sniper issue."

I'm not really sure what would work but it would be nice if they had a system where the team could vote on a battle commander of sorts whom could guide players. Perhaps take the top three players/volunteers and let players vote in the first 30 seconds to 1 minute of the game. Obviously the commander couldn't compel anyone to do anything but giving that person exclusive map ping ability may be helpful. Honestly, not sure if it would work but I think it is worth trying out."
ArmoredWarfare,383gbr,BestAccountMD,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:36:01 2015 UTC,"In my honest opinion the game is sub par in every way other than graphics. Everything feels so sloppy, inconsistent or down right stupid. I hate how armor means nothing and maneuvering your tank to try and get a better angle is just an exercise of futility. Its going to pen no matter what. If I had a choice between the T-64 and a Sheridan, I would pick the Sheridan hands down.   Another thing I despise is the camo/spotting system. All it does is promote camping and punish any slightly aggressive plays. Wanna push and break the stalemate; well enjoy losing half your health to even attempt to do so. It plays so passively, that the game has become a bore in such a short time is unfathomable to me."

Some games, the dev makes you pay through the nose to help test (and advocate for) their product.  While there are certainly players who will spend $60+ or even $100 for early access to a game, I think it's not cool of the developer.  First impression of AW is very positive, but I'll need to play more and different tanks to get a sense of how balanced the game is.   donate to SilentStalker for the promo   The timing of the two in hindsight was unfortunate, from a perception standpoint.

ArmoredWarfare,383ws7,fizzymilk757,2,Mon Jun 1 17:54:19 2015 UTC,"I must say, as an avid arty player in WoT, playing it in AW is completely different. You're top tier but you function much like the french t4 premium arty does. In that, I mean you basically just annoy the shit out of the enemy and maybe play mop up on low hp tanks. At least that's how the Gvodztika feels to be played.   Something this vid doesn't display is counter battery. They way it works right now, with such long travel time, unless the enemy is a complete boob and doesn't move, it's impossible to counter bat the enemy even with a 10 second spotting."
ArmoredWarfare,383ws7,MinorityShack,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"I don't see the point to arty outside of creating a griefing/handicap position. I'd rather we have another player who actually has to play the game and not sit back in base and play whac-a-tank. Fine, leave arty in PvE for coop players who want to sit back and relax with their friends but in PvP no (I'd probably buy arty too if it was PvE only). An indirect fire mechanic is inherently unfair in the PvP portion of the game where nearly every player requires direct line of sight."

ArmoredWarfare,382oyv,SturmWolf88,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:21:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the overall speed increase (or just flat double the speed), the reason I'm thinking of missiles accelerating is to prevent them being overpowered at close range so that people would have a small chance to evade a high penetrating/damaging shot being fired from lets say ~100 meters away, in this particular case the player would have a bit less second to react (imagining the missile left the barrel at 100m/s and maybe accelerated to something ~130m/s). But after reaching ""top speed"" the missiles would at least be more reliable to be fired at targets at extreme distances."
ArmoredWarfare,382oyv,SturmWolf88,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:01:23 2015 UTC,"Tried the Shillelagh missiles on the Sheridan, and they are a bit too slow imo.  I tend to stick with my 152mm HEAT rounds, as most of the time the enemy tank moves into cover before my missile is halfway to them."
ArmoredWarfare,382oyv,BackwerdsMan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:35:01 2015 UTC,"Atm the Sheridan is a bit overpowered imho. I don't have thats much of a problem with its damage as I do with its a high caliber low velocity gun accuracy.   The large caliber ensured a powerful shaped charge capable of destroying tanks; velocity has no impact on shaped charge penetration, and the short gun would reduce weight. However, a low velocity reduces accuracy.  The M81E1 was not ideal in medium- and long-range tank engagements as its low velocity produced extended flight times, and made it difficult to lead moving targets."
ArmoredWarfare,382oyv,Alazais86,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:12:43 2015 UTC,"Meh, i whilst it's gun is a hard hitter, nerfing it's rate of fire will mean autocannon tanks will be able to kill a full hp sheridan before he can reload.  I think it's quite alright as is."

ArmoredWarfare,380y5u,Incogneato_alamode,2,Mon Jun 1 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"HEAT in this game works as a High alpha damage, Low Penetration type of round. Other than its relatively low pen, it also has problems going through Spaced armour and ERA. If you hit the tracks in the wrong place they will act as a sort of spaced armour, therefore reducing the penetration of the ""projectile"" so that it won't be able to penetrate the side of these tanks."

ArmoredWarfare,380y5u,SovietMario,2,Mon Jun 1 12:42:33 2015 UTC,HEAT uses a jet of molten copper which slices its way through the armor into the tank to cause havoc. Spaced armor naturally blocks that jet of molten copper by making it spread out on penetration of the first target then leaving little penetration ability to get through the successive plates. Tracks are excellent at doing this because the shell has a lot of places ti hit that aren't the main body armor and likely it wont go through.  Side-note: ERA is designed to act like spaced armor when it gets penetrated so shooting heat at anything with ERA is not going to penetrate unless the ERA panels have already been blown off.
ArmoredWarfare,380y5u,WCsharpeh,2,Mon Jun 1 02:57:31 2015 UTC,"There's no jet of molten anything, it penetrates via pure explosive force"
ArmoredWarfare,380y5u,OtterTenet,2,Tue Jun 2 18:18:49 2015 UTC,"HEAT can pre-detonate on external components, especially tracks, that are offset from the armored compartment. This results in severe reduction in penetration power.  When shooting HEAT, attempt to land the shot on a flat surface.   Further details:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-explosive_anti-tank_warhead#Effect"
ArmoredWarfare,380y5u,autowikibot,3,Mon Jun 1 03:48:33 2015 UTC,"Section 4. Effect of article  High-explosive anti-tank warhead:       The stream moves at hypersonic speeds (up to 25 times the speed of sound) in solid material and therefore erodes exclusively in the contact area of jet and armor material. The correct detonation point of the warhead and spacing is critical for optimum penetration, for two reasons:   If the HEAT warhead is detonated too close to the target's surface, there is not enough time for the particle stream to fully develop. That is why most modern HEAT warheads have what is called a ""standoff"", in the form of an extended nose cap or probe in front of the warhead.  The distance is critical because the stream disintegrates and disperses after a relatively short distance, usually well under 2 metres. The stream material is formed by a cone of metal foil lining, usually copper, though ductile iron and tin foil was commonly used during the Second World War.   The key to the effectiveness of a HEAT round is the diameter of the warhead. As the penetration continues through the armor, the width of the hole decreases leading to a characteristic ""fist to finger"" penetration, where the size of the eventual ""finger"" is based on the size of the original ""fist"". In general, very early HEAT rounds could expect to penetrate armor of 150% to 250% of their diameters, and these numbers were typical of early weapons used during World War II. Since the Second World War, the penetration of HEAT rounds relative to projectile diameters has steadily increased as a result of improved liner material and metal jet performance. Some modern examples claim numbers as high as 700%.      Interesting: MGM-166 LOSAT | 8.8 cm Raketenwerfer 43 | Toophan | M47 Dragon   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

ArmoredWarfare,380y5u,Crisis7,2,Mon Jun 1 03:48:38 2015 UTC,Shell mechanics are a bit bugged ATM in this testing stage. But HEAT would probably be weaked by external modules ie tracks. Though I'm not sure if this how its supposed to be or not.
ArmoredWarfare,380y5u,Alazais86,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:08:26 2015 UTC,"The T-62 HEAT wasn't super reliable for me but the T-64 HEAT was working wonders, it has a great amount of pen and I was regularly going through the sides, sometimes even the front of MBTs (with the exception of other T-64s only). Same goes for the HEAT on the Sheriden, that stuff is bonkers good, even gone right through some T-62 turrets from the front."
ArmoredWarfare,380z9g,Tyrandar,4,Mon Jun 1 01:30:42 2015 UTC,That the PvE leads somewhere and isnt just like PvP But with bots and lower income. would be fun to have some sort of ''boss'' that might drop camo patterns or something like it.
ArmoredWarfare,380z9g,Nefarioz,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"I have a mental picture of a large tank being blown up and his paint peeling off and laying on the ground, in its former owners shape, now."
ArmoredWarfare,380z9g,Lictuel,2,Mon Jun 1 07:58:14 2015 UTC,"I would love to see strung-together missions (as well as individual ones, ofc.!) into mini-campaigns of various difficulty. Would also be really cool to see PVE incorporated into metagame elements; say if you had something like strongholds/clanwars from world of tanks, but PVE. So maybe your clan has some base/territory that you build up and defend, and you can go raid NPC bases, etc.  Anything to really make it interesting/engaging, and not let it just be one-off bot deathmatches or one-shot scenarios only."
ArmoredWarfare,380z9g,pyrosity,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:24:48 2015 UTC,Honestly I think bot matches could be ok but not what I really want. Personally I want large missions or campaigns. Maybe a story about your PMC. Considering the fact that obsidian are big RPG guys I think they could do some really cool PVE. I think a bunch of missions strung together as a campaign could be cool and because it's a F2P game that will hopefully keep making money they could keep adding campaigns.
ArmoredWarfare,380z9g,caboose309,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:31:44 2015 UTC,City maps! I hate alley fights in PvPs of cos but I wouldn't mind playing them for PvE missions.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,Denelorn,3,Sun May 31 21:35:52 2015 UTC,"You do realize that you earn more in higher-tier tanks, right?..."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,stringerbell,5,Mon Jun 1 03:12:59 2015 UTC,You earn the most in t4's. Tier 5 and 6 earn less
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,illusionalsagacity,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:16:18 2015 UTC,Not really. Stingray earns about 10k shooting at much lower tiers.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,illusionalsagacity,2,Mon Jun 1 05:16:49 2015 UTC,Yea but your experience is based. Playing the strongest tanks in MM and rolling over people who don't know which way to point their turrets is a bit skewed for gains.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,Gatortribe,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:02:19 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying it'll earn more when shooting at higher tiers. My experience is biased because of MM yes, but that doesn't mean the credit earnings potential isn't there. I guess we'll see later on and when tiers 7&8 are introduced."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,OtterTenet,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:48:58 2015 UTC,Leo made 7k a game (with you or USA taking all the damage) no matter what the MM was. M60 made 5-6k. I'll have to see what the A3 makes.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,intank31,3,Mon Jun 1 05:48:00 2015 UTC,"The earning rate is indeed too low, for the reason indicated.  Discouraged from considering the LoW pack until I see response to key feedback, including this point."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,Tomalie,2,Sun May 31 21:41:04 2015 UTC,Gotta remember none of us are playing with premium yet. This is what the grind will be like without premium.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,Lord_Doener,3,Sun May 31 22:11:08 2015 UTC,"So 75 games with premium and around 10 mins a match, 12.5 hours grind for a tier 5?   I would hate to see what t8 will be :)"
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,VGA_EU,2,Mon Jun 1 00:08:11 2015 UTC,A tier 5 in AW is basically a tier 6.25 in WoT (max tier 8 vs 10).  And its been a long time since i've played WoT but 12.5 hours to get from tier 5 to tier 6 seems about right. But that's too much grinding for my taste.  EDIT: Just realised that tier 9 and 10 are going to be added at some point. So yeah 12.5 hours to get from tier 4 to 5 is definetly too much.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,caboose309,-3,Mon Jun 1 10:24:28 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, I mean ONE DAY to get a T5? OMG! HOW CAN I MANAGE?????"
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,CDXVI,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was going to say this, we are all playing without premium and generally after tier 5 in these kinds of games, the grind is horrendous. Idk it seems like the norm for me. Then again I don't have a problem with a lot of the grinding in WoT so take that for what it's worth. Honestly I like it so far."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,LVirus,2,Mon Jun 1 06:46:01 2015 UTC,Remember T8 is the highest standard tier. AW more or less skipped the WoT low tier scene.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,FrankyMcShanky,2,Mon Jun 1 04:51:01 2015 UTC,For now. 9 and 10 is coming thou.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,LVirus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:27:55 2015 UTC,Actually they're not.  I'll have to dig up the post but for the foreseeable future tier 8 is top tier.  Tier 9 and 10 won't be coming until way after launch.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,FrankyMcShanky,1 point,Mon Jun 1 10:43:28 2015 UTC,But they will eventually come as I said earlier.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,CDXVI,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:05:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was unclear.  According to the devs at the moment they have no plans for tiers 9 and 10.  So they may never come.  We don't know anything."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,Crisis7,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:40:25 2015 UTC,"Sure. But for now Obsidian is not planning to add them to the existing dealer trees either. I guess the world knows too little about the contemporary edge-cutting tanks and there are a lot of missing parts. Until they can figure out places for them in the trees, they will more or less serve as trophy tanks I guess (think Obj 260 in WoT :D ).  http://aw.my.com/us/news/general/introducing-t-14-armata"
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,Salaris,2,Mon Jun 1 13:36:04 2015 UTC,"Speed of Progression is also something to be tested, so what we experience is something that is not likely final.   Once Obsidians gains enough feedback from this testing, they can adjust the income, costs, and unlock requirements.  Also AW has less tiers from 1-8. Tier 9-10 will possibly added later(acting as tier 11-12).  So a tier 5 is more like a tier 6-7 tank."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,Nefarioz,2,Mon Jun 1 08:10:40 2015 UTC,"We definitely don't want the game to feel like a grind, but with Tier 8 being our maximum for the foreseeable future, we need to make sure that players don't breeze through it instantly.   With only a few hours to play each day, we're already seeing Tier 6s (although granted most of those are because of the weirdness of the Sheridan block, which we intend to address.)  It's a careful balance, but we're definitely paying attention to player feedback and want the game to feel as fun as possible."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,King_of_Nope,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:14:30 2015 UTC,Both yes and no imo. during beta tests it would feel nice to have some ''boosted'' income of reputation and credits so we can tests the different vehicles. But as it feels now i feel like i have something to play for if the game was in open beta. its a fine line between Being to much of a grind or to little.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,illusionalsagacity,1 point,Sun May 31 22:34:16 2015 UTC,"I suspect its to limit players from getting a tier 5 vehicle in the alpha like was done for part of WoWS alpha. Its the only sense I can make with such a part xp increase from 4 to 5, but not as drastic from 5 to 6."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,illusionalsagacity,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:01:51 2015 UTC,"People who went the sheridan route are already in tier 6's.  The reason being they are OP as shit and make 6-12k money a match, people who previously tested already had arty's and LAV-300's unlocked just needed money. Another friend used sheridan to farm money and is already in a LAV-300"
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,RickR13,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:04:53 2015 UTC,No just me and one other dude are in stingrays at this point I think.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,HarshTruth22,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:48:26 2015 UTC,Seen 3 different people in stingrays so far. 2 LAV-300's considering there is 2 days of test left id assume thats really early.  Common denominator? Sheridan
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,Crisis7,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:15:50 2015 UTC,It's a little bit faster than the last test but not by too much
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,OtterTenet,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:17:27 2015 UTC,"The credit system is indeed too slow, but hey, its alpha! Anything can change, and I hope Obsidian will hear our cry for help"
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,clierik,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:19:45 2015 UTC,"What makes it even worse is that this is ""Accelerated"" for testing purposes."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,HarshTruth22,4,Mon Jun 1 00:56:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is accelerated. This is probably actual, progression speed is part of testing."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,clierik,2,Mon Jun 1 08:12:34 2015 UTC,I don't think it is at this point.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,CDXVI,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:20:35 2015 UTC,"It takes around ~3-4 games to get out of tier 1, ~10-15 battles to get out of tier 2, how many games would you need to play to get out of lats say tier 1 in wot? I'd say the income is as HarshTruth22 said accelerated. As well you can take a look at the current tanks that you see around you during battle - tier 4's, note that these people do not have premium, the have limited time to play.  I might be wrong on this income thing but from my experience on other F2P games there will be some grind (though I'd like less of it)."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,clierik,2,Mon Jun 1 06:14:57 2015 UTC,how many games would you need to play to get out of lats say tier 1 in wot?   Tier 1 in WoT is easy to do in 1 game now with 2x daily bonus but of corse WoT has 10 tiers. Tier 1-4 seem about right to me in game for a no premium yet grind but 5 and 6 are insane grinds.
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,Salaris,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:43:57 2015 UTC,"I'll reinstall wot to double check its progression in first tiers. Its a jump in the price and a fairly big one I agree on that, but lets say we have a look at it from the Dev perspective, the player grind is were they feed there families from: premium time, premium vehicles, premium toilet paper! Its not really beneficial in the long run to give us the players a chance to ""run past"" the low-mid tier content to the top.  Edit: removed something that I already said."
ArmoredWarfare,3805gj,Fighterpilot108,2,Mon Jun 1 07:07:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. One of the charms that WoT had to me is that I can never seem to have all the tanks I like. If I top tiered every line in WoT I would probably have already quit.  On a side note, the grinding in WoT is not just plain and boring plus/minus. It has some ""WoT individual mission"" elements which I really like."
ArmoredWarfare,380uah,Gwarh,3,Mon Jun 1 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"The consumables do work. If you use the regular 250 credit consumable, you have to select the module/crew member you want to fix. It doesn't automatically fix it. If you use the 500 credit module, it fixes them instantly."
ArmoredWarfare,380uah,EntombedMonarch,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:11:44 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh  I bet that is what i've been doing wrong, not selecting the module that was damaged. Thanks EntomedMonarch."
ArmoredWarfare,380uah,OfensiveBias,2,Mon Jun 1 13:05:33 2015 UTC,"The med/repair consumables and engine consumables work great, but I really don't think the commander consumables are working right."
ArmoredWarfare,380uah,Alazais86,2,Mon Jun 1 05:32:40 2015 UTC,"I've actually had a few dud repair kits. Sometimes I use it and select the only damaged thing and nothing gets repaired. Most of the time it works fine though, extinguishers and med kits always worked fine for me."
ArmoredWarfare,381nh3,Fallout4please,3,Mon Jun 1 05:09:24 2015 UTC,"the game doesnt have nation wide trees. The whole thing about the game is that you play as a PMC and so you buy tanks from ''Dealers''. The vehicles and dealers have different traits though, for example Marats vehicle is slow and hard hitting meanwhile Sofies tend to be more agile and used as ''snipers''."
ArmoredWarfare,381nh3,Nefarioz,2,Mon Jun 1 05:38:02 2015 UTC,dat slow moving M60 though
ArmoredWarfare,381nh3,CDXVI,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:04:22 2015 UTC,I honestly dont understand why the M60 gets so much hate. i played it several times and i just love how you can just angle the front so people will bounce. Extremely useful around corners! :D
ArmoredWarfare,381nh3,Nefarioz,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:06:54 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the armor is mostly just troll and isn't reliable at all."
ArmoredWarfare,381nh3,ABetterKamahl1234,2,Wed Jun 3 03:05:44 2015 UTC,Obsidian has stated repeatedly that they do not want to divide the trees by nation/geography but rather by similarity in fighting style. I have to admit it is kind of weird especially if you are a WoT veteran. But I really like it.  There is also this political correctness at stake I guess?
ArmoredWarfare,381nh3,CDXVI,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:06:50 2015 UTC,"They aren't final, and they have been changing significantly between builds."
ArmoredWarfare,381nh3,OfensiveBias,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:11:45 2015 UTC,"From what I've gathered the dealers are going to be themed. So expect to see one with slower, heavier armoured and high firepower types (M1 Abrams, Challenger etc.) and another dealer would be selling faster, less armoured more stealthy and perhaps a wider selection of AFVs, another dealer might sell more tank destroyers instead of MBTs. That kind of thing.   It is awkward to get used to when you come from WoT, there is something fun about driving your national vehicles (heck, the first thing I tried to do in AW was grind for my own nations tank - the Chieftain.) But after reflecting on it more this system is actually much nicer, this way we get to drive amazing tanks like the Merkava which would not be possible with national trees, given that the country doesn't have enough probably."
ArmoredWarfare,381nh3,Alazais86,-2,Mon Jun 1 11:31:36 2015 UTC,"When things become more finalized, I hope to see some consistency between the branches since the trees aren't bound by nationality.  It really makes no sense to me to go M60 -> Leopard 1 -> M60A3, when the Leopard 1 is so unlike the other two in terms of armor and mobility."
ArmoredWarfare,381nh3,RazgrizS57,2,Mon Jun 1 06:26:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hope each dealer has their own flavor of vehicle."
ArmoredWarfare,381nh3,caboose309,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:43:32 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure they will. It just makes no sense to introduce Dealers with like 2 vehicles in EA
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,darkknightxda,7,Sun May 31 16:35:53 2015 UTC,"Welcome to testing. Resets will happen. If you don't like them, I suggest you avoid playing until we get a confirmed date for open beta.   Sad but true, nothing you do now will last."
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,trobsmonkey,3,Sun May 31 23:02:19 2015 UTC,"We're almost definitely going to have to wipe at some point, but we're going to try to keep the wipes to a minimum.   Keeping the wipes infrequent is generally more fun for the players and it's also very useful to us to see how long it takes for players to organically hit high tiers, as well as retention rates when players do hit the top tiers.  That said, it's almost certain we'll have to wipe eventually, and I can't make any guarantees about if and when those wipes might be."
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,Salaris,1 point,Wed Jun 3 06:04:07 2015 UTC,No resets in the last 3 days.
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,Vroco,1 point,Sun May 31 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's asking about each day, rather each test. Seeing as we're on early access test #1 which ends on the 3rd, he's asking if we will be reset on the next early access test which is most likely yes."
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,yosp,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:48:46 2015 UTC,I'm going to  be very sad if my progress gets reset every week... I enjoy playing the game even at tiers 1-3 but the tanks are getting better as I progress!
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,Ziggsrpg,1 point,Sun May 31 18:20:14 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they may reset it for every major client update. That way new features can be tested across all tiers and any specific vehicle bugs can be stomped.
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,Strader69,1 point,Sun May 31 22:40:08 2015 UTC,"From the forums  http://aw.my.com/en/forum/showthread.php?13191-Wipe-after-early-access&p=213395&viewfull=1#post213395   Hey everyone,   I just wanted to clarify what is going on since I feel it could be confusing due to some terminology overlap.  Buying the founders pack guarantees access to the CBT phase of development. That is what you are participating in right now. It's being called 'Early Access', but it is essentially our Closed Beta Test. If you do not buy a founders pack, you can still get into CBT either by winning various contests hosted on the forums or other related sites, or just by enrolling into the Beta on aw.my.com and waiting for your invite to eventually come. I imagine the closer we get to launch, the more will be let into CBT from that signup list, but I don't have control over that myself.  At the end of CBT, all progress will be wiped.  Buying the founders pack ALSO guarantees you a head start at launch. There will be a window of time between CBT and launch where only players who purchased founders packs will be able to play. Any progress made during this window of time will NOT be wiped and will stay with you forever.  I hope that helps clarify things for everyone. You are getting two 'early accesses' with the Founders Pack purchase. We are currently in the first one.   I think next test might be with premium activated all the time to test if the numbers are reasonable."

ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,K1ttykat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:42:10 2015 UTC,Had a game with one of the devs yesterday and he said there won't be a wipe for the next test atleast.
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,Lictuel,0,Mon Jun 1 07:56:10 2015 UTC,Would you guys want a reset if you lose matches due to the horizontal sniper view glitch?
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,imaginary_num6er,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:47:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone cares at this point about win/loss stats.  1:  It's very easy to form platoons of currently unbalanced vehicles, so nobody really cares about stats.  Sheridan/Stingray platoons are pretty much considered obnoxious kids min/maxing for the chuckles and not taken seriously.  2:  Wipes will be happening frequently, so there really is no point.  Don't get me wrong, I understand losses actually matter to some people in a test... even if I don't agree that it matters in any way."
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,Ranger1Presents,-1,Mon Jun 1 16:58:49 2015 UTC,what trobsmonkey said.  Wipes are going to happen. I fully expect a wipe before open beta. And possibly before full release.
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,DMercenary,3,Sun May 31 23:06:55 2015 UTC,"I don't expect one before full release, since the premium time from the founders pack starts in open beta. But maybe they'll do something else before full release."
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,Gabost8,-2,Sun May 31 23:12:10 2015 UTC,"since the premium time from the founders pack starts in open beta. But maybe they'll do something else before full release.   Fair enough, but SOP for those types of wipes is that it would be reimbursed.   Like I can see a wipe but all your accumulated experience and money(both cred and prem) would be reimbursed with the xp turning into global xp."
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,DMercenary,3,Sun May 31 23:14:56 2015 UTC,Doubtful.  I've done dozens of alpha  and beta tests. I have never seen a reimbursement. My guess is last wipe will be before the open beta starts and the founder packs kick in.
ArmoredWarfare,37z0ms,trobsmonkey,-1,Sun May 31 23:21:05 2015 UTC,Its never been done because its really dumb and will piss off people even if you do reimburse them.

ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,baconmastah,6,Sun May 31 07:04:42 2015 UTC,"The gameplay is identical. If you're looking to get away from stale gameplay, I'm really not convinced that ATGMs and the arty changes are enough that you'll suddenly be shocked into believing. All these people who come along and say that AW will be the death of WoT and that they're so glad AW is going to replace WoT and they can't wait to play AW are pretty dillusional. The gameplay is the same.  The best aspect of AW is that they do not have 3+ years of terrible decision making as precedent, and have the option of making good calls from the start."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,Constriction,5,Sun May 31 12:50:46 2015 UTC,"Sure, WoT won't die because of AW, but I think it will lose bigger part of player base than when War Thunder came out.

You don't have slow behemoths like Maus or T95 that will slow down your team, you don't have to hide behind hard cover in fear of getting killed with one hit by arty, you have to think more about ammo types, differences between classes are bigger.  But at the end it will come down to the way the game is monetized, end game content and the way devs treat players. We don't want another Serb/Storm and WG EU.  And even if AW won't be as big a success as I hope it will be, it will still motivate wargaming to rework some of the gameplay concepts in WoT (arty anyone?) just so it can keep up with competition. Players win either way, and that's what matters, right?"
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,FeniEnt,5,Sun May 31 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"I don't expect WoT to die. I DO expect the competition to help SerB get his head out of his ass. Something I don't think the best surgeons nor the liberal application of Vaseline behind his ears, will be able to achieve."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,Ukiah,7,Sun May 31 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"I think AW is an arrow to the knee for Wargamming.  Its a fresh and interesting take of the games of this genre.  You can play any tier you like and still contribute toward leveling up vehicles on a different chain.  You can progress by damage dealt over 300m, under 150m, spotting, overall damage and games played in a particular dealers vehicles.  Very cool and awesome ideas!   Vehicle commanders are interchangeable and specialize in a certain fighting style.  Crew bonus are cool too, lots of choices to choose from.  No gold ammo, as far as I've heard and read, will be introduced.  Hopefully no XVM type crap will be allowed, that stuff is toxic IMO, allowing others to troll, grief or whine about their team or others with information provided.  I am looking forward to the progression of the game development, Obsidian seems to have thought thing out and are on track to produce a outstanding product, just hope my wallet can handle the shower of gratitude I feel coming on =D"

ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,Fenxis,5,Mon Jun 1 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"Better yet, i'll break it down Barney style for you.  Allowing players information not crucial to game play...ie ""stats"" is not necessary in the overall scheme of playing.    The only thing XVM gives is a creditable platform for some disgruntled players blame their lack of performance or statical epeen on others.  They can deny that ultimately its not their fault in their own W/L record.  I'm a firm believer you control your own W/L record, not others.  http://forum.worldoftanks.com/index.php?/topic/276797-how-to-control-your-win-rate/  Thank you LittleWhiteMouse for these words of wisdom, only if it was mandatory reading for all players, number 3# is key for all players!!!  Another toxic syndrome that occurs is player demoralization.  Seeing you ""only have a 30% chance to win"" disheartens the weak mind or willed to play to the best of their abilities IMO.  They say ""Oh well...fuck it, it's a lost cause"".    IMO who cares who is good and who is bad.  Without XVM you have to trust or not trust in your team unconditionally.  It adds an element of suspense or surprise into the game.  Most importantly, I've rarely seen XVM used for the benefit of the team or the community.  I constantly see XVM used mostly to berate or chastise others for the benefit of the angry or disfranchised players who take their lack of control of the situation out on others.  TL;DR:  VXM overall is not a good community resource, it only benefits a small percentage who know how to utilize it to its full potential.  It does more harm than good in my eyes.  /end of XVM rant"
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,CarnageINC,4,Sun May 31 13:45:42 2015 UTC,"XVM itself is pretty awesome. You forget that it gives you access not only to stats (I have them disabled - best idea ever), but also to garage tools, damage tracker, better minimap and few other things."

ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,FeniEnt,2,Sun May 31 21:08:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I would like to see my personal stats and how they hold up against the userbase. Nothing like in-game stats at real time, but maybe something like how the Marks of Excellence give you what percentile you are in for each tank. Just being able to see the numbers over a period of time gives me a lot of information of where I'm doing well and where I'm falling behind."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,asdaaaaaaaa,-3,Sun May 31 20:42:06 2015 UTC,"I have never once felt that my winrate in WoT was even tangentially under my control, there are simply too many variables that are beyond my influence."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,polarisdelta,5,Sun May 31 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is that players with 60%+ win rate just got really lucky with their teams over let's say 10k battles and those with under 50% just didn't get teams that were good enough? Sure, you can't carry all the battles, but saying you have no control over your win rate is pure BS."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,FeniEnt,-6,Sun May 31 14:46:51 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying is that the RNG engines that drive shot placement, pen, and damage and the positions of 29 other players are something it's possible to routinely overcome and produce victory?  I don't buy it at all. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose but no matter what you're just in the back seat, along for the ride. If it really were something players could do, you'd see a lot more 60% players. You'd even see more than a handful of 80% players floating around."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,polarisdelta,3,Sun May 31 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"I never said that you can win 100% if you're good enough, but saying that you can't improve your win rate is just an excuse for poor gameplay. You're never in the backseat unless you play arty. You can react to the battle, you can aim for weakspots, use armor, flank and do shit ton of other things that can and WILL affect your win rate."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,FeniEnt,3,Sun May 31 15:07:31 2015 UTC,"You are wrong.  It has nothing to do with RNG and shots.  It has everything to do with situational awareness, good decision making and exchange rates (taking damage versus giving damage).    Poor players over extend or place themselves in the wrong position for their type of vehicle.  This is compounded by poor decision making choices either by not understand the game mechanics and/or their skill levels or lots of other variables.    No one gets your vehicle killed or loses a game but yourself.  You put yourself in that losing situation either not doing the right thing with your vehicle, lack of situational awareness or by being to aggressive or not being aggressive enough in the right situations.  Owning up and trying to learning from your mistakes will only make you a better player in any game.   Blaming others for a loss is total and complete BS.  You ultimately played a part in the loss, regardless of how well you played.  Same with victories, your actions matter!"
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,CarnageINC,-5,Sun May 31 15:26:00 2015 UTC,"It has everything to do with situational awareness, good decision making and exchange rates (taking damage versus giving damage).   You can't give damage if you can't hit your target. You can't hit your target if the RNG says your shells fly over or short of your target. You can't do damage if you hit your target and don't pen or if a track eats the shot entirely.   Owning up and trying to learning from your mistakes will only make you a better player in any game.   Sure, it might even bump your WR by 1-2% in WoT. Or you can buy gold ammo to ignore pen (you'll still miss and tracks will still absorb plenty), or you can just be lucky. There are too many variables out of your control for your performance as a player to significantly throw the outcome of a given match."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,polarisdelta,1 point,Sun May 31 15:41:25 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that everyone is equal with RNG. If RNG only affected specific tanks or players, then yes, it would be important. The best players get the same lucky and bullshit RNG rolls that the worst players get. Sure, RNG can affect you and maaaaybe give you 100+/- WN8, but it's not something that's new and targets specific people. I'm currently in the 83% for my SU-152, which is arguably one of the most RNG affected tanks besides artillery. So you're saying that the only reason I'm better than 80% of the players is because I got lucky 250+ games in a row?"
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,asdaaaaaaaa,2,Sun May 31 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"A portion of your W/R is out of your control.  Remember, even bots get a 40% WR.    There is a correlation between WN8 and W/R at the mid levels (for the orange/yellow/green/blue players).  Funny, the players it correlates well with really don't care while the players that really care (the unicums) the correlation falls apart."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,cruelster,-5,Sun May 31 15:27:55 2015 UTC,It is a fantasy of anyone who is lucky that they are skilled. This applies equally to people who worked hard their whole lives to turn their $300m inheritance into $400m and people who win a video game slightly more than other people.

ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,OtterTenet,-1,Sun May 31 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"http://www.modxvm.com/en/  Have you ever read this page? 4/5ths of the XVM mod has nothing to do with statistics.  If anything, you should be protesting Wargaming's API that releases your information."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,OtterTenet,1 point,Sun May 31 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yes I have read it, have you read what I posted...no....your focused on only the other ""4/5 aspect"", not what I'm ranting about.  You know I'm not talking about all the non stat goodies that XVM provides.  I'm talking about the toxic part of the system.    To deny that XVM provides a platform for griefers or trolls is ignorant.   That the stats part of XVM does not need to be part of AW or Wot for it to be played successfully.  Wargamming, IMO, is most of the problem, not XVM.  However, XVM is the most convenient tool that allows this toxicity to creep into the game atmosphere.  Overall, it allows a small portion of the community a tool to troll or berate others which is uncalled for, unwanted or unneeded."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,CarnageINC,0,Sun May 31 15:10:42 2015 UTC,"I see two aspects of this problem:  1) You are mislabeling XVM as Toxic, when the majority of it's functions, 4 out of 5, have nothing to do with them, and are extremely useful to players.   2) I don't buy the argument that Statistics themselves are 100% toxic as you try to claim.  Some of the best things that happened to me personally in WoT were due to the Statistics API that Wargaming included in the game.  The first time I realized that my winrate was above 50% and some people were at 60% or higher, is when I decided to learn to play the game - to turn from an amateur to a veteran.  Before that inspiration to improve, I was a freeloader, not paying a dime for the game. After realizing the game has depth, I started paying for Premium Account and bought my first Premium tank, a $50+ investment.  Without statistics I would have never realized the game was worth anything.   Without statistics I wouldn't have met a person named ""Starfire"" with who agreed to platoon with me after I noticed his above average statistics and politely asked join up.  Without that connection I would have never followed him into Black Berets [BB_], and would have never been accepted because I did not have Tier 10 tanks and they wouldn't have a reason to give me a chance.  They wouldn't look at me as an investment in a talented player that would later pay off.  Because my name was meaningless to them at that point.   Without joining BB_ I would have never ended up involved in the GSA merger that created OTTER, my WoT clan for the past 2 years.  Some of the most fun I've had in WoT happened in OTTER.   For example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llmMxFXEqsU  Without statistics I would have never gotten a chance to join the Clan Wars community on the level that produces such excitement, that inspires me to make videos.  3). It's an absolute lie that Statistics produce Toxicity.  I see plenty of insults and provocations in Armored Warfare (and other games) without any statistics involved. Toxicity is the product of anonymity and open chat systems.   4) It's also a lie that berating and trolling only occurs with a ""small portion of the community"". In reality the majority does it to some extent.  For example, you trolled and berated the work of XVM modders in your posts, but don't recognize it as such because it's your point of view. You don't recognize others."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,OtterTenet,2,Sun May 31 16:48:17 2015 UTC,"You are arguing with a troll, but in a sense you are arguing with a troll that is right. In a way you have lost the argument in advance by responding to a troll, and you should have noticed at the line line ""have you read what I posted...no....your focused on"".  What I mean is, he right is that some people use the information XVM provides to be toxic to the community. I don't know what his stats are and I don't care, but I believe him completely that he has become toxic to the community and uses the information XVM provides to do it.  I was also in BB when it collapsed, and I agree with you completely in that it helped shape my knowledge of the game. XVM is a tool, nothing more nothing less. The fact that some people use that information to be toxic to the community is an unfortunate byproduct, not a fault of the tool itself."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,TheDecoyTV,-2,Mon Jun 1 03:40:26 2015 UTC,"I do enjoy a good sparring debate, this has been jun for me but I'm going to make one last post to you, then I'm done feeding you.  OtterTenet, you are a very good player (canadianimpact I believe) but are a poor debater.  Here is why.  You blatantly ignore what was written by those who your arguing against.  The only other explanation is that you don't read or comprehend English well, which is not an insult, just a fact.  You fail to make valid counter points to a debate/argument.  You try to shift away from the single and concise core issue (Public stats, ie XVM, used by griefers/trolls) by ""shotgun spreading"" your responses.   I've addressed this before, I said; ""Yes I have read it, have you read what I posted...no....your focused on only the other ""4/5 aspect"", not what I'm ranting about. You know I'm not talking about all the non stat goodies that XVM provides. I'm talking about the toxic part of the system."" The small little part of XVM allowing all to view public stats is the problem, since it is interconnected with XVM as a whole, that is why its primary term used.  If WG would close off public viewing of stats it would be one less tool for griefers to use. Nowhere did I stat ""100%"".  Injecting false statements into debate is a cheap and easy way to inflate ones stance.  Nowhere did I say they should not have stats.  Your misinterpreting what I'm saying.  Public access to players stats is not needed to play the game.  All sorts of people do fine without that portion of XVM enabled.  Overall, public stat viewing does more harm than good.  You only look at it from a self-centered view.  Whats good about XVM to you.  I'm looking at it as whats good for the community as a whole. This a repeat of your second point.  Poor debaters often over use this tactic, your rephrasing your statement to make it appear as if its a new point.  Of course their are other insults and provocations, nowhere did I say there was not.  That is beyond all of us to control.  As far as anonymity, welcome to the internet, this is the only thing you have said I can somewhat agree on.  But that cannot be helped, it is the core pat of the whole internet.  Open chat is not toxic in itself, it is a tool (the messenger or vehicle of delivery), for griefers and trolls to use. Final lesson in debating, making a statement that can not be backed up in any form what so ever.  You PROVE to me the majority do it.  Give me an outside source of data that is credible to make your point.  IMO it is the vocal minority who are heard, not the silent majority.  I also fail to see any portion of what I wrote anywhere here a troll or beratement toward the XVM modders.  This is a misdirection ploy to try to gain support to your argument.  ""You don't recognize others"", I'm not arguing against others, I'm arguing against you sir and your attempts to counter what I am saying.   Overall I feel what I have stated has merit.  It is your choice to disregard it if you chose, I could care less."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,CarnageINC,1 point,Sun May 31 23:13:28 2015 UTC,"The ensuing 'discussion' in response to your question should be your answer.  But I'll go one further. There's a thread over on wotlabs, started by Garbad. Garbad is REALLY good at WoT. He either helped come up with or has quickly adopted a 'new' metric to replace wn8. It's called xTE. In the simplest terms, there's no 'overall' value. It's per tank and it is ENTIRELY based on the dmg you do in a specific tank based against the damage done by the top 100 players of that tank.  For all the players who use XVM to bitch and complain about their teams, there's an equal number of 'good' players who use XVM as some surrogate validation of their existence. People like Garbad got good at WoT. It fulfilled some deep, inner need to be good at something. But, OTHER people got good at WoT too. Those people have stats approaching Garbad's. Garbad's fragile self-ego can't handle that. It was time to arbitrarily move the goalposts. This dynamic will endlessly repeat. Garbad will arrive at a spot and announce that THAT spot is the peak. The top of the mountain. Right up until other people figure out how reach those numbers and join him on the summit. He'll pick up and move again and then decide wherever he stops as THE NEW SUMMIT.  The absolute LACK of any statistics/api of AW will prevent him, and those like him, from doing this. People will still rage about their teams in AW. They'll still blame others for their own inadequacies. They'll just have to do it without a completely made up, arbitrary ranking system.  TLDR - Garbad is frustrated by Oedipal issues."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,Ukiah,2,Sun May 31 16:58:08 2015 UTC,"Thats a bunch of nonsense, just like the insult in your TLDR.   The competitive community is bigger than Wotlabs, much bigger. Both are much bigger than Garbad.   If I wanted to hear an opinion on important metrics, I would ask other people. Like CanadianImpact for example, or one of the recruiters in my clan.   Who is Garbad? A good guide writer for a certain level of development. A good inspiration for certain aggressive tactics. He's one out of the many notable characters, and not the best or most useful.   Definitely not useful for generalizations about Statistics and your ignorant post. (Ignorant as in, you ignored every argument I wrote and responded with nonsense)."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,OtterTenet,0,Sun May 31 18:35:34 2015 UTC,"Ignorant as in, you ignored every argument I wrote and responded with nonsense   What particular points were you arguing? I was responding to:   How is XVM, aka eXtended Visualization Mod, toxic?   I felt that most of the other replies demonstrated the toxicity regarding XVM far better than any argument I could articulate. I DID go a little further and point out what I felt, specifically, was toxic about XVM, ie that it not only allows but PROMOTES stratification of 'players'.  You're presumably in OTTER. That also presumes you're a good player. Good for you. There are a LOT of players who have good wn8's and AREN'T douche-bags about it. Zeven is one. Jerm is another. Trobs is a really cool guy. There's plenty. But there are FAR more who really think their wn8 means they're actually SOMEBODY in this world."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,Ukiah,1 point,Sun May 31 19:17:44 2015 UTC,with that part about being an arrow to the knee is kinda true but also keep in mind this is a new game they just took the idea`s from wg and the WoT players. and since wg got some serious competition from AW i think the players will be the winners in this fight. since they both want to be the best in their genre.
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,mitchzz,3,Sun May 31 18:27:56 2015 UTC,"Eventually you will find AW stale as well. This is true for all games.   The basics for the two games are pretty close so any WoT veteran can jump into the action immediately. AW for now has nothing to lose to stand out from WoT and they have a much better engine/platform, so they can try all kind of stuff that WoT would not feel comfortable trying. It's really the fine detail of AW that set this game apart."
ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,CDXVI,7,Sun May 31 15:20:23 2015 UTC,"14k battles in WoT here and I can safely say AW is a breath of fresh air for me. I just had to quit WoT because of the arty, it just made the game completely ruined for me in certain tanks on certain maps - Developers response? - Play a different game... just wow.   So seeing AW come up with realistic fixes to broken WoT mechanics is fantastic to me. As for pay to win? - So far AW seems to be almost too fair, what is there to pay for? Garage slots are free, HEAT is standard ammo choice costing maybe 2-5% more than its AP counterpart and you don't even need to retrain your commander when switching to a new tank.   I'm also enjoying no XVM stats tracking, it's depressing to know how bad/good certain teams are before the 30s countdown is even over but yet be at a disadvantage to not use that type of mod. Also  the lack of national tech trees will mean that no ""paper"" tanks need to be squeezed into the line up to fill out a tree - we will likely just see similar tanks in a tree, M1 Abrams along with a Challenger 2 in the same tree, fine for me."

ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,YT4LYFE,2,Mon Jun 1 15:22:11 2015 UTC,I really enjoy AW but I don't think it needs to be an all or nothing switch. For example I've played WoW for many years now and every time a popular mmo comes out everybody says this is the WoW killer!! It never is though there are always a portion of players that stay with the new game but most people like me find a happy place in the middle and enjoy both games for what they offer.  This is just to say that for AW to succeed we don't need WoT to fail in fact having competition in the arcade tank genre would be great so lets hope they both succeed!!

ArmoredWarfare,37xowg,Gravelock,1 point,Sun May 31 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"Its different well a bit different, the core of WoT and AW are very similar with health bars and spotting being almost the same. Low tiers feel the most like low tier WoT with auto cannons derping around. The early tanks like the M60 and T 62 are also similar to basic WoT. The REAL difference happens higher up in tiers when AW truly becomes its own with missiles, reactive armor, and other advanced stuff that isn't a part of WoT. As for concerns of any kind of p2w its just too early to know, once it hits beta we will know a lot more. Now to XVM... IF they allow mods it WILL become a part of AW at some point I guarantee it no matter what objections there are. Why? AW player base will be mostly people who play/ed WoT since that is the market they are trying to enter. It seems there is a planned clan function with possible WoT like clan wars that will give a longer replay ability/reason to play lots.  Overall its fun and nice n fresh."

This is coming from a veteran WoT player with 47k battles, I think it is trying to be a direct replacement and how well it will do depends on how the company does balancing and progression and such.  The first few days of early access were a little crazy, everyone has lights aka AFVs and the battles were derp fests of autocannon spray, but now that a lot of people have tier 3's there are a lot less spotter tanks it's starting to get interesting.  Here is an 8 kill game I did yesterday in the LAV-150, which is a tier 2 wheeled vehicle with a 25mm cannon.

Just see for yourself instead of basing your opinion on the opinion of someone else.  +it's alpha so we don't know yet how good AW will end up being.  But objectively the differences are:  -Better graphics in every way except the tanks itself, they look quite pale, pretty low detail, bad lighting effects, tracks are grey blob. But alpha is alpha. I'm sure they'll still be worked on.  -Sound quality is a lot better than WoT. The tank guns sound like tank guns.  -Less P2W since there is no gold ammo.  -Maps seem better but this is hard to say already since there hasn't really developed a meta yet for each map.  -More types of ammo with more interesting downsides/upsides for each of them. I can actually see ammo switching perks being a viable option.  -Arty is high ROF, low damage, large splash radius. PoV like the battle assistant mod. You get a warning if arty shoots you.   -Missiles  -Smoke  -Dealers instead of nation trees, so the tanks will be from a greater number of nations in AW.  -..."

Can't balance them without a lot of data. So I wouldn't worry. In some previous test phases they've unlocked all tanks purely for testing so I'd imagine it's possible they could do so again briefly for a weekend perhaps. Nothing set in stone though.

I purchased an NP8130 back in 2011 and was really happy with it, so when I bought a new laptop earlier this year, I picked up the NP8268-S with the new Nvidia 9xx series of mobile GPUs.  The GTX 970m is an excellent GPU, I can run every game I play (WoT, GW2, AW) at highest settings and get north of 30 FPS.  Aside from that, I think Sager (aka Clevo) is the best kept secret in the gaming laptop space. I previously owned an Alienware and it was a bloated, slow, and overpriced."

ArmoredWarfare,37v388,Ziggsrpg,7,Sat May 30 17:22:40 2015 UTC,Most of the time when I'm fully aimed in with the patton it just misses anyway.
ArmoredWarfare,37v388,MichalTK,2,Sat May 30 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"There are multiple accuracy increasing options for MBTs, at least in my T-62 and T-64 I had a module with +10% accuracy, and 2 skills from crew and commander.

ArmoredWarfare,37v388,pyrosity,2,Sun May 31 00:33:20 2015 UTC,"I find it to be a nice ""Feature"" of the game. it makes IFV's and light tanks more mobile than their MBT cousins that have to stop and fire to be accurate. And besides, MBT's already have a Health, Armour, and Firepower advantage over other tanks, you gotta make them bad at something :P"
ArmoredWarfare,37v388,NotAvn1r,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:26:45 2015 UTC,Not a bad point! Although the afv vehichles seem almost overpowered right now not under. At least at low tiers.

ArmoredWarfare,37v388,Sisaroth,0,Sat May 30 20:25:26 2015 UTC,The distribution seems a lot flatter in AW than in WoT but imo its fine since aiming time is much shorter. My first games in the patton have been terrible though because i was snapshotting to much :p. But that's just something you have to adjust too. Not something that makes the game worse.

ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,TheAylius,5,Sat May 30 04:48:42 2015 UTC,"The Sheridan never had APFSDS, so that needs to go.  It only ever had HE, Frag, Missile, and Beehive rounds (which were GODLY in the jungle). The turret was REALLY cramped and loaders hated it.  Jack up the reload time. OTM accuracy needs fixing.   I'm confident these will be addressed, though."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Hotblack_Desiato_,5,Sat May 30 16:56:33 2015 UTC,"The problem with the Sheridan is not the Accuracy or Mobility, it's the decision to give it so much damage per shot and such high DPM.  The way to balance it is through the damage and reload."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,OtterTenet,2,Sat May 30 06:31:52 2015 UTC,I suspect if the Sheridan is nerfed it will be done through penetration values and maybe alpha.  I believe Obsidian wants to have a (potential) DPM hierarchy of AFV>Light Tanks> Main Battle tanks.
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,FrankyMcShanky,6,Sat May 30 06:35:58 2015 UTC,"True but you are forgetting Armor as a factor - there are MBT's without armor that can't fit that mold.   Similarly, the Sheridan has sufficient positive qualities without DPM - the gun depression, the mobility, the accuracy."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,OtterTenet,1 point,Sat May 30 06:37:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the ""combat"" DPM is supposed to be AFV's(0 pen vs the MBT's they're supposed to face) Tank destroyers, Lights and then MBT's. The two gun centric classes, TD's and LT's should be on the upside of the DPM scale."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Brovich,3,Sat May 30 06:56:47 2015 UTC,Can you fire ATGMs on the move?
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Brovich,3,Sat May 30 05:16:44 2015 UTC,"No you cannot. It seems that the ATGM's serve as an ability to do heavy damage and reliably penn tanks from the front when you're facing up tiered opponents. Problem being Tier IV is the highest anyone's gotten so far in the test so it's like a really high tier Scout in WoT fighting tier 1's, it's like punching babies."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,illusionalsagacity,3,Sat May 30 05:28:58 2015 UTC,Do you think the T-64 can withstand the Sheridan's APFSDS and HEAT rounds?
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Bluenosedcoop,4,Sat May 30 05:52:46 2015 UTC,The T-64 can't stand up to the T-62's APFSDS currently. So... no.
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Gatortribe,3,Sat May 30 06:13:09 2015 UTC,"With a well placed shot the T62 and patton can pen a T64, since the Sheridan has 300+mm of penetration with its APFS and HEAT rounds I'm sure it's lower plate and turret will get cheesed. Regardless if a Sheridan gets in your sights in a T64, he better prepare for its 467 Alpha Heat round to retaliate."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Bluenosedcoop,2,Sat May 30 06:51:21 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem with the Sheridan isn't the gun/ammo but it's the light tank trait that it gets that means it has no reticule bloom when turning the turret, If they removed this trait from the sheridan it would the tank hell of a lot more balanced."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Gatortribe,1 point,Sat May 30 14:14:23 2015 UTC,Then every Sheridan would snipe and we'd be back to square one.
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Gravelock,1 point,Sat May 30 14:40:47 2015 UTC,"No you wouldn't be back at square one because they would then have to deal with the long aim time and relatively bad accuracy and a reticule that blooms massively at the slightest bit of movement.  Nerfing any pen or alpha of the tank is against what the 152mm cannon was designed as, The whole tank is based around that gun if you nerf that then it has nothing noteworthy."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,illusionalsagacity,1 point,Sat May 30 15:19:59 2015 UTC,"A reload nerf would be fine for it because then an MBT could 1 on 1 it. Removing the light tank buff makes it, well, not a light tank."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,OtterTenet,4,Sat May 30 15:30:06 2015 UTC,"Yes all the Light Tanks are extremely overpowered, they have spotting advantage which allows them to spot you, shoot, and hide so by the time the enemy sees you, you're behind a wall. They can easily stay in cover from a long distance and snipe like a TD while never being detected. Most of them have higher DPM and in some cases higher ALPHA then even the current MBTs in the game. There spotting ability is extremely powerful as well."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Gatortribe,2,Sat May 30 05:22:39 2015 UTC,"Their view range is barely better than an MBT, with a small camo bonus, and zero armor. Try pushing a light tank sometime, instead of allowing them to peek-a-boom. Everything can be countered with tactics, even if it's overpowered. Besides, if you are relying on your own view range in an MBT, you are doing it wrong."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,eLdritchD,2,Sat May 30 06:11:30 2015 UTC,The problem is that the Tier 3 MBT's are very weak frontally and there's something wrong with autocannon damage calculations.
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Gatortribe,2,Sat May 30 06:35:27 2015 UTC,"Fallout from the HE bug I'd assume. I like that AFVs can do something to MBTs with HE, but 400dmg while they can only shoot 250-370 in return? That's a problem. I know what they wanted to do- make AFVs more appealing to the average player, something I pushed for greatly after the first alpha. It just seems they made them too good against MBTs."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,eLdritchD,7,Sat May 30 07:41:35 2015 UTC,I don't think AFVs should do anything to MBTs from the front. They should always have to flank. What's the point of being an MBT if it just makes you slower and loses you DPM? Might as well play a Light Tank if your armor isn't an advantage.
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,Gravelock,0,Sat May 30 09:28:57 2015 UTC,"I get that, I just think they shouldn't do damage every shot. Should be 2 dmg every three hits. New players don't want a Pz. I c vs KV-1 experience, so being able to hurt MBTs will be beneficial to getting a larger player base. If AFVs had guns that seemed useless, it would draw people away from them and in some cases away from the game all together.  I don't like them in their current state, but I do believe Obsidian is on to something. They just made that something way too strong."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,illusionalsagacity,4,Sat May 30 14:38:21 2015 UTC,"but it's not the same as a Pz1 vs a KV-1 because the Pz1 can't pen the KV from any angle. Ever. I am totally fine with AFVs getting a good amount of AP penetration when shooting into MBT butts. Because then they 1. outsmarted the MBT and 2. Those tanks from the 60s frontloaded their armor quite heavily and sacrificed side and rear armor for speed.  I totally agree invulnerable tanks at any tier are a bloody nightmare that I would not like to see repeated in this game... but frontally MBTs need to be able to stand up to AFVs. Also it would encourage the right kind of playstyle for new AFV players, you know? flank and spank =)"
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,FrankyMcShanky,-3,Sat May 30 19:19:04 2015 UTC,"View Range doesn't take into account the mechinics, they made it so light tanks are not spotted as quickly even once they come into view they have 1-2 seconds before they appear to the enemy they also have instant sixth sense while other tanks take 2-3 seconds before it shows you're sighted."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,FrankyMcShanky,3,Sat May 30 08:25:53 2015 UTC,"That's completely inaccurate. There's no difference in the sixth sense for any of the tanks. Spotting and tanks being rendered has a slight delay for all tanks, that's been an issue for a long time and is not unique to light tanks."
ArmoredWarfare,37t6v2,goodoldxelos,2,Sat May 30 15:06:18 2015 UTC,I think it's to hard to judge the strength of tier 4 vehicles at the moment.  There are so few of them running around that they're almost always the only tier 4 in a match giving them a rather huge advantage.  Give it a few days to let the tier spread stabilize and then revisit your opinion please.

ArmoredWarfare,37rndt,_FinnTheHuman_,6,Mon Jun 1 00:49:37 2015 UTC,My complaint is the fact that they put the NA servers on the west coast when the majority of north American players are going to be on the east coast (I say this based on the WoT server populations) I ping the same to EU and to NA. Which kinda' defeats having separate NA and EU servers for east coast players.
ArmoredWarfare,37rndt,LordCurlyFry,3,Sat May 30 04:00:56 2015 UTC,"Now that explains why I'm having equal ping to EU and NA, that's just plain silly. Maybe they did it just for the Early Alpha to also cover the Aussies and guys from the Pacific. If not, it doesn't make any sense."

As you get $5 worth of gold, and 15 days of premium (based on other games, a month will likely be ~$10, so let's call that another $5 of value there) you're basically paying $5 for a head start on open beta and what will likely be several months of early access.

ArmoredWarfare,37p8dw,Brovich,1 point,Sun May 31 09:49:19 2015 UTC,How is this POS supposed to stand up to the BMP Terminator?   They are both tier 6 or am I missing something?
ArmoredWarfare,37p8dw,VexatiousOne,2,Fri May 29 18:26:46 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest... The BMP terminator is a unproven vehicle used by only one country(Kazakhstan) Russia and other countries passed it up and were not interested in using or buying it... The game has really hyped it up above its reality. However  It is a pretty cool vehicle with a lot of damage potential.   From a perspective I would think the hull of the Terminator may have better armor overall but I believe the turret of the Bradley is superior in armor to the unmanned turret of the terminator.  Also ammo type may be a factor here... between the 25mm vs 30mm I do not know which has superior ammo types.  Also while the TOW system is much older I do not know which one has a superior missile system vs armor, very different directions and technology.   Also from game scouting point of view depending on how the game uses viewpoints the bradley may have a better advantage ingame in scouting by being taller allowing it to utilize terrain more.   Plus... these two vehicles may or may not end up in the same tier afterall..."
ArmoredWarfare,37p8dw,Brovich,1 point,Fri May 29 19:42:11 2015 UTC,"The main reason the Terminator was not bought is because the T-15 is just better.  How I see it is:  Armor:  Bradley - for taking 30mm shots  Terminator - for taking 105mm shots  Fire power:   Bradley - 1 25mm gun. 2 Clumsy ATGMs made for infantry use.  Terminator - 2 30mm guns, 4 ATGMs made for launching off of vehicles.  Speed: About the same."
ArmoredWarfare,37p8dw,VexatiousOne,3,Fri May 29 19:50:13 2015 UTC,If you think the Terminator turret can take a 105 shot and be any type of functional that is comedy gold.  Also once again... 25mm vs 30mm... comes down to ammo type.  ATGM... does not matter how its launched only matters what it does when and if it connects..
ArmoredWarfare,37p8dw,Brovich,2,Fri May 29 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"If you think the Terminator turret can take a 105 shot and be any type of functional that is comedy gold.   The hull has ERA and is based of the T-72. That is plenty enough to withstand 105mm rounds. I agree that the turret cannot.   Also once again... 25mm vs 30mm... comes down to ammo type.   25mm vs 30mm in the real world means that the 30mm shell is almost twice as heavy. So the HE shell for the 30mm would be almost twice as effective.  And then the BMPT has two 30mm guns. That means about 4 times more fire power when it comes down to pure weight of the shells.   When it comes down to penetration, the 30mm could not be less effective than the 25mm, and again, there is two 30mm guns on the BMPT.   ATGM... does not matter how its launched only matters what it does when and if it connects..   Um things like missile speed and maneuverability are also very important. The Ataka travels twice as fast as the TOW.  Edit: and 4 Atakas vs 2 TOWs(I don't know if that makes a difference in this game though.)"
ArmoredWarfare,37p8dw,VexatiousOne,2,Fri May 29 20:17:33 2015 UTC,Just a FYI... the duel 30mm only has a combined 600 rpm compared to 500 for the bradley... not a huge difference.  Also you simply can not ignore ammo type and blindly say 30mm > 25mm... The same rounds are not available for both.
ArmoredWarfare,37p8dw,0pyrophosphate0,2,Fri May 29 20:31:05 2015 UTC,"You also can't simply ignore how big of a difference there is from a 25mm gun to a 30mm gun. 20% larger diameter doesn't mean 20% more potential muzzle energy, it means nearly double the muzzle energy (assuming of course that muzzle energy scales with chamber volume, which is not strictly true). Subcaliber AP rounds could maybe make up that difference if there was a very large disparity in ammo quality (and I see no reason to believe such disparity exists). With HE rounds, forget about it."
ArmoredWarfare,37p8dw,VexatiousOne,1 point,Sun May 31 07:00:33 2015 UTC,"Good points.  HE rounds the terminator should win for sure.  However my one caveat to that is in accuracy.  HE is already not the most accurate ammo.  I am very curious to see the burst(3-5) round accuracy of the duel 30mm vs the 25mm at medium-long range.  With a ROF that is not drastically different a high enough accuracy from the 25mm may keep the damage output between them somewhat close.  And you are right in regards to the AP rounds... I think for instance if DU(depleted uranium) are implemented for the bradley and not the terminator it may give it a edge or close the gap in AP output as well.   With the Terminator probably having the edge on damage output I think the game will balance it with the vulnerability of the Terminator weapon system vs the Bradleys Turret.  Bottom line is its a game, so these factors will be tweaked and balanced out and who knows... these vehicles may not even end up in the same tier at all by launch of the game."

ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,kamlnskl,3,Fri May 29 04:58:40 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll share some of my notes that I took down in the few games I got today.   Better optimization all around. I went from 50 in the garage and ~30-40 in game to straight 60. Experience gains were set at a good value. I felt that I made progress even from a loss where I did a substantial amount of damage. Under the weapon description when you hover over the armaments in the research/upgrade screen ""Speed"" should be changed to ""Velocity"" or ""Shell Speed"" just to make things clear. The vehicle stats could be a little bit larger than they are on the left hand side of the research/upgrade screen, right now that box is pretty small. At low tiers the autocannons still seem to hold an edge over single shot weapons even at range simply because they can put out continuous fire meaning they can still do sustained damage at range MM still needs a little bit of work balancing the teams tier wise but they were usually pretty close. This may be a current non issue due to the low player counts. Going through a shallow stream really seemed to slow down even fast vehicles. A solution to this would be to give historically amphibious vehicles (PT-76, BMP series etc.) a bit of a faster speed through shallow water. As mentioned by OP scraping damage is still a bit of an issue. Perhaps having a multiplier that reduces the damage dealt to friendly vehicles by ramming is in order? I couldn't change the chat modes after the game had ""ended"" meaning I was stuck in team chat and not global. Occasional disconnect from the garage Inopportune freeze/crashes, first time I've seen this and I've been in all the previous tests."
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Strader69,1 point,Fri May 29 05:20:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think especially that amphibious idea is fantastic, it would be cool to see that implemented.    As well as I occasionally found it jarring when I wanted to talk after that game ends, or say gg to everyone, I was restricted to team chat. Also another thing, some of the hitboxes especially on port storm were kind of big, especially things like crushed cargo containers and train carts, but that can be shoved aside for sure."
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Yetanotherfurry,3,Fri May 29 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"I think HE belts are in an odd spot. MBTs aren't happy as is because they don't feel beefy when a 20 can tear them down, but if you nerf them the AFVs won't be able to fight heavily armored vehicles.  Imho I found them fine, plinking away at a T-62 who can 2 or 3 shot me seems balanced."
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Regyn,2,Fri May 29 06:46:38 2015 UTC,"They still would be able to fight them, just not frontally :D Anyways, as stated the HP pool is quite large, so it is okay."
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Yetanotherfurry,-1,Fri May 29 08:48:15 2015 UTC,If not frontally then they may as well not be able to engage at all. The ability to effectively flank a target comes and goes and most targets can readjust to protect themselves against it after only a few shots. Not to mention the AP belts struggle with even side armor.
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Terrachova,3,Fri May 29 12:03:19 2015 UTC,An LAV shouldn't be able to fight an MBT head on.  That's kind of the point.
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Yetanotherfurry,-2,Fri May 29 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"That's not how AW is being balanced. If you want a game that leaves players helpless as somebody facerapes them then go back to WoT. As is every tank can battle any other tank. Skill can overcome differences in tier or class.  You outgun the LAVs pretty bad, if you're in a position where you can't punish them for exposing themselves to take shots you need to relocate."

ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Yetanotherfurry,-2,Fri May 29 18:10:18 2015 UTC,"Because the LAV is sacrificing most of his damage to do any to you, you have more HP than he does, you do more damage than he does, and he can't use AP because you have so much armor."
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,zirce,2,Fri May 29 18:12:57 2015 UTC,There's no way they are going to release a game where lighter faster tanks can take on heavier tanks from the front and win a lot of the time.
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Yetanotherfurry,-1,Fri May 29 18:16:16 2015 UTC,"It's not a case of ""OMG LAV-150 is better than M60"" like you're making it out to be. In any manfight the M60 will stomp the 150, but the 150 has the option to actually do damage to the M60 without getting lucky on flanking shots."
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,zirce,2,Fri May 29 18:19:36 2015 UTC,Flanking isn't something that's hard to do with a highly mobile tank in the mid/late game.  Lights are perfectly balanced in wot why change it?
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,TheAylius,2,Fri May 29 18:31:44 2015 UTC,"I witnessed an AMX-10P blow 400hp off my T62 with direct hits to my turret when I was hull down, I'm fine with the ability to take down MBT's easier than some other games, but that seriously needs to get removed or severely nerfed."
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,monilas,1 point,Fri May 29 15:05:54 2015 UTC,"I dont have too many issues with HE belts at the moment - yes they can hurt a hull-down T62, but the IFV has to keep themselves exposed to fire at you."
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Yetanotherfurry,1 point,Sat May 30 05:51:49 2015 UTC,exactly what I'm saying. you have to let them get those shots off for them to do more than 50 damage.

ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Siambretta,1 point,Fri May 29 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking about that last night. The M113 isn't fast, but the PT-76 is pitiful: drives like a well armored bathtub and even the turret traverse is painfully slow.  It does get better at tier 2 though, the LAV-150 and the Scorpion feel quick and agile."
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,monilas,1 point,Fri May 29 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"The T62 does feel sluggish, but consider that before that you've been playing the amazingly agile scorpion. I will say that the best engine and upgraded tracks make the T62 feel a lot better."

ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,MacAdler,1 point,Fri May 29 15:10:46 2015 UTC,"I was on a LAV last night, and it took me like 4 of 5 clips, from quite far, to bring a M60 to around 600hp, he hit me twice and I was gone. I understand what you say, but when you see yourself with just a bunch of AFVs against a couple of M60, the HE shells give you at least a chance to make it fair using a mixture of vision abuse, came, and small dmg.   I agree on the ramming dmg, it's kind of dumb that I'm backing up and I lose 15hp because there's a tank parked right behind me. They need to fix that part.   Tanks do feel different to drive one from another, so I like that there. And it does feel like the changes in terrain, and while breaking stuff, do affect the speed.  Oh, and one other thing: THEY GO OVER ROCKS!!! They don't stop dead on their tracks because a little pebble doe not let them go above it. [Looking at you wot].  So far I like it very much, and I had a lot of fun last night, and more taking in account that it was mainly tier 1-3 battles."
ArmoredWarfare,37op2i,Terrachova,1 point,Fri May 29 15:16:14 2015 UTC,"You have to keep in mind that, especially in high tiers, if an autocannon LAV or AFV gets behind an MBT... that's all but game over for the MBT.  The BMP-2 shines for this.  That thing will straight up murder MBTs if it gets shots on the rear, but it can't - or shouldn't be able to - do the same frontally.  Another thing is that AFVs and LAVs are so, so much more agile than MBTs as you go up the lines.  You can easily circle most MBTs, and the ones you can't are generally unarmored as is, like the Leopard 1."

On my devils canyon with a MARS(2x 760) settings maxed out I was able to get 40+ FPS.  Which is great as when it becomes optimized and drivers for it come avail i have a good feeling about the play ability at least on newer 1-2 year old PCs.  What is shocking is that the Witcher3 maxed out does play smoother and better on my PC I did not expect that.   On game play the Autoloaders are a pain in the ass... but they are also weak... the 20-30mm guns are quite capable... as someone who used to gun a bradley for a living, people quite often fail to realize just how deadly a 25mm auto cannon(or any auto cannon is) is.  While obviously they will never survive against a MBT head to head they are very capable of crippling one and causing damage from a flank.  If your getting killed by one in a MBT your simply being outplayed(often flanked is what I saw last night)."

It has similar accuracy,  much better damage, is faster and the turret is really strong at the cost of a weaker hull and less view range vs. The Patton.  the lower profile of the T-62 is also a bonus in a lot of cases.

ArmoredWarfare,37owgb,Bluenosedcoop,1 point,Fri May 29 10:21:28 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree. It's pretty well armoured in the front with good sloping but its engine bay is wildly exposed. The traverse rate makes it hard to counter flanking attacks.

I liked that there is more information present when you look for it. For example you mentioned how when getting new modules you can see exactly what is improved and by how much. I like that when you're battling there's more information present, whether you hit someone or not, etc etc.  But the UI is just not fantastic. Something that really bugged me was that there were ""Are you sure?"" type pop ups for every little thing. I put a repair kit as a consumable ""Are you sure?"". I put a med kit as a consumable next ""Are you sure?"". I put a fire extinguisher finally ""ARE YOU SURE?"". And then there's a pop up for each auto option.

I'm eager to get another tank with HE and dick around with it tonight.  Something I noticed is that modules seem far less likely to eat shots and module damage seems far more consistent than in World of Tanks.  Last night every time I penned an engine with my scorpion I started a fire.  Granted I only did this 3 times.  Might just be coincidence.

Other than that i'm fine with them dealing damage past my 143mm armor."
ArmoredWarfare,37ku2u,Kilabi,1 point,Thu May 28 17:58:06 2015 UTC,"In the event that the HE mechanic is not working as intended and your statement is true, ignore my opinion   I think it's working as intended but the actual damage formula isn't where it should be.  Armor doesn't seem to mitigate it as much as it should, imo.   I feel as though Scorpions could use an aim time reduction    Do you mean that it should take longer to aim?  Yeah, prolly couldn't hurt.     or a penalty to shot on the move   This is harder for me to agree with.  At the moment the auto aim seems really wonky and ineffective, so I've found snapshotting on the move is a bit of a pain in the ass.  So it's hard for me to measure how accurate or inaccurate snapshots are."
ArmoredWarfare,37ku2u,neuetype,1 point,Thu May 28 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"When I have 10 tanks in my garage, how will I remember which dealer I got it from (and why should it matter)?   Background of the tank-icon in garage is the dealer icon. Some tanks need certain achievements to unlock. Like 60 battles with dealer As tanks or X damage while driving dealer B tanks and so on. Nice to find the right tank fast.  When having a tank that increases its view range by 25 % when stopped, does it activate immediately or only after a few seconds after stopping? Is the circle on the minimap the 125 % circle or the 100 % circle?  You can actually see the circle get bigger as soon as you stand still. It even shrinks when firing because of the recoil movement i guess.  So it should be instant.  All other questions I am searching some definitive answer myself. Loads of guessing on the forums but no real hard info."

It's just unacceptable that they can't handle the traffic and it's sad that they've done this so poorly, blah blah blah, unfollow and even unsubbed one guy.

If i set everything to ""low"" i get about 45-65 FPS.  So i'm a little skeptical of how well he says it's running for him.  I guess he isn't saying what resolution he's running at - so keep that in mind.  This game is terribly optomized at this point, and even if it runs like shit right now (which I would argue it does) I am positive we will see huge improvements soon in that regard."
ArmoredWarfare,37kbsw,TimSWTOR,1 point,Fri May 29 06:02:51 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, I like what I have seen so far. In one of my battles, a PT-76 on our side managed to kill the last remaining T-62 on the enemy team, so it seems that as long as you play the tank well, you won't have a lot of difficulties facing tanks well above your tier. Like you, my favorite tank so far is the Scorpion. You can sit in a spot behind some low cover to hide your hull and take shots, then quickly dash forward to flank the enemy after they have taken their shot. On the port map, there's a warehouse with a loading platform which you can hide behind perfectly, only exposing your gun and top of turret. From that position it's really easy to rush a lone tank that is hiding between the stacks of containers. It even has enough speed to effectively evade fire from the auto-cannons from the M113 and LAV-150, though you need to get to within touching distance to really be able to do so. Best thing to do is rush then from cover, get close to their side, then get into cover again on the other side. Looking forward to the next round tonight and hopefully getting to the next tier!"

ArmoredWarfare,37m0v3,TheAylius,1 point,Thu May 28 17:12:42 2015 UTC,Does it sound like it would be something implemented in game? Is it sort of an electronic boop? That's the sound of an enemy tank being spotted and since it makes that sound after first spot you'll usually hear it spammed because the main enemy force is found all at once.

ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Kirby420_,8,Thu May 28 00:59:00 2015 UTC,"As Freitag posted (In case we bring the website down for a 3rd time);   5:55pm PDT (8:55pm EDT): Hey guys, we're very sorry to do this, but unfortunately we're having issues that we need time to fix, and as a result will need to cancel today's Early Access test for the NA. We'll share more information with you as soon as we have it.  ~Freitag   On the plus side, now I can totally go make dinner without fear of missing when the servers do go up!"
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,LRafols,8,Thu May 28 00:59:33 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't really mind. I knew what I was getting into purchasing an EA pack (not that it influenced anything because I participated in the earlier tests) and I expected the servers to have a melt down on the first day because well... that's usually what happens.  I understand why people are upset about this, but this should have been expected. Pretty much every big launch gets rekt by a huge day-one attendance and servers pretty much implode. Early Access is also not a new thing- you pay to help test the game in its infancy and the bonuses (in this case, premium, gold, timed-exclusives) are just additional incentives to help test the game. Expecting a fully finished game when they flat out said ""Stuff will break. It is very normal during an early test that everything will not go smoothly, and many things are just not final.""[sic] as well as ""If you are not interested in testing the game at this early stage, we suggest you wait for a few updates, but we really appreciate everyone that is able to help.""[sic] is a foolish thing to think.  Also the mods are actively moderating the sub so if you see flaming or trolling or whatever (we already have a few of those instances which were suppressed) please report them."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,WhosTrance,1 point,Thu May 28 02:11:51 2015 UTC,Very well said
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Kuro_yami,9,Fri May 29 16:16:19 2015 UTC,Trolls are seriously out in force on the forums. That or people are genuinely stupid enough not to expect this sort of thing in the testing stages.
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Bluenosedcoop,5,Thu May 28 01:13:26 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of confusion is coming from AW/Obsidian's rather terrible decision to call this an Early Access, The name doesn't mean what it used to a year ago now every idiot thinks they are getting a playable product."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,FrankyMcShanky,2,Thu May 28 02:45:18 2015 UTC,"Hit the nail on the head.    I'm not really upset about not getting to dick around with the client tonight and expected as much.  That being said, Obsidian does have a bit of a PR blunder to deal with.  They mislabeled the whole ""early access thing""  Should have called it ""guaranteed closed beta/alpha"" or something."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,VexatiousOne,2,Thu May 28 03:32:33 2015 UTC,Combination of both... some are definitely pure trolls... others are simply being ignorant
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Stranger371,1 point,Thu May 28 01:16:50 2015 UTC,They should add a simple intelligence test before being able to buy the EA.
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Durandy,1 point,Thu May 28 20:42:52 2015 UTC,Generally when you offer early access with pre-orders in an effort to drive pre-order sales and you derp an entire day of early access people tend to get mad.
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,amatterofwhom,-4,Thu May 28 01:17:01 2015 UTC,That or people are genuinely stupid enough not to expect this sort of thing in the testing stages.   The Devs or the Users? :)
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Kuro_yami,3,Thu May 28 01:23:57 2015 UTC,I am sure the devs expect this and many many more things to go wrong while we test :)
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,my_freitag,2,Thu May 28 01:27:47 2015 UTC,"That or people are genuinely stupid enough not to expect this sort of thing in the testing stages.   You are absolutely right. As we stated in the Early Access Producer's Letter, we expected things to go wrong. Fortunately these issues should be resolved now, and we're in the process of fixing other stuff as we speak. The coming days should be much more stable. knock on wood"
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,yosp,4,Thu May 28 06:23:11 2015 UTC,"Damn, well hopefully NA will get double up-time tomorrow ;)"
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Siambretta,2,Thu May 28 01:03:04 2015 UTC,"I know servers cost money, but I think they should stop with the time-limted thing. People will have time to play and the servers will be less strained when they go up."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,amatterofwhom,3,Thu May 28 01:05:21 2015 UTC,The point of time limiting is so they can find issues and fix them without having to be all like /global_announce SERVERS ARE GOING DOWN TO FIX <SUPERLITTLEBUGWEFOUND#1651> and constantly bringing them up and down.
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Siambretta,3,Thu May 28 01:07:45 2015 UTC,"This is the issue with selling early access. It's guaranteed to produce a ton of butthurt fanboys.  Personally, I don't mind - it's beta/testing/etc. and yet I can't help but feel these people have a complaint, they paid for early access - starting the 27th and were denied."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,saltyorange,5,Thu May 28 01:14:54 2015 UTC,"I paid for premium time, a premium vehicle, some in-game gold and other stuff for a not-yet-released game. I always took the EA access as a ""thank you"" gift for giving them money upfront and as a chance to help the developers with feedback.  Those who thought they were paying to play a game before anyone else... well, thought wrong :P"
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Flaktrack,4,Thu May 28 01:27:16 2015 UTC,"Those who thought they were paying to play a game before anyone else... well, thought wrong :P   Not really you are just imposing your views on others, if someone bought EA to play early then that's what they paid for, it is part of the package even if you don't view it that way yourself. Stuff like this is to be expected in a test of course, but it's like the guy above said, it's the problem with selling a beta."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,bucktizown,4,Thu May 28 01:53:42 2015 UTC,"The devs were pretty forthcoming with what Early Access meant and explained in several places that the game won't always be available. The only thing you could argue was sprung on us was the small test windows (which I personally understand but they did come out of nowhere and I can see why people are surprised/upset... should have expected it though, that's EA for you)."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Siambretta,1 point,Thu May 28 02:25:10 2015 UTC,"The reason they are selling it, was to ensure that the people who say they want to test, have to make a credible commitment to that cause.  That way people won;t just join because they want to play, then be mad it's not ready."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,FreezingNipple,6,Thu May 28 03:08:12 2015 UTC,"And letting people set time aside for a specific period, restarting the servers a dozen times and then cancelling the test for the day is... better?"
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Siambretta,3,Thu May 28 01:11:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, because they can make changes and fix things at their own pace this way. This is beta, not a demo, if you paid for early access then you paid to experience and help fix these bugs.  Also bare in mind that stress testing servers is extremely important, we've just done that."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Flaktrack,8,Thu May 28 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"Why are you explaining to me what are we supposed to do? Contrary to most people I do know what I got into.  Maybe it's just me, but it seems counter-intuitive: If you only give players the chance to play for a few hours, you as a developer don't have a lot of time to fix things at your own pace; you either fix them quickly or you cancel the thing altogether like it just happened."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,Siambretta,1 point,Thu May 28 01:24:33 2015 UTC,"Being a developer myself, my guess is that they're testing for particular things that need a lot of players online at the same time. They also probably need time to parse the data, patch the game/server, test it out, and put it back up. These things take serious time, especially for a game in such an early state."
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,LRafols,2,Thu May 28 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"Being a developer myself, and having released a multi-player game (not as big as this one, though), I am aware of those things.   Hell, the developers themselves said that the current client isn't very optimized because it's sending tons of metrics. Those metrics probably would add up a lot of server space / bandwidth very, very fast if you let the players in 24/7. You also need people monitoring the servers when they could be doing something else (IF they hired full sysadmin staff at all).  This method, however, flings a lot of players, data and traffic all together in a very short period of time... with very little threshold to fix things on the fly. Maybe we can compromise? Something like 6 hours?"
ArmoredWarfare,37j94t,JFSwifty,1 point,Thu May 28 02:59:10 2015 UTC,They said that in the future they'd expand the time slots until it's fully available 24/7. Weird logic if you ask me but I understand some of their reasons for doing so.

ArmoredWarfare,37lbom,CDXVI,2,Thu May 28 13:34:59 2015 UTC,There is autoaim just right click on the target however it is kinda buggy..for me it loses the target quite randomly

ArmoredWarfare,37lbom,Stromovik,1 point,Thu May 28 13:49:22 2015 UTC,Autoaim is there it losses aim when there is no LOS.
ArmoredWarfare,37lbom,alayton,1 point,Thu May 28 17:22:49 2015 UTC,"It doesn't help much. It doesn't track moving targets very well, so shots at anything not sitting still tend to miss. If you're a bad player and using autoaim a lot, it's just going to reinforce your bad play."
ArmoredWarfare,37lbom,Ziggsrpg,1 point,Thu May 28 19:05:23 2015 UTC,Its most useful for when you are circling a target and trying to watch where you are driving while shooting a target. Its a very situational tool and the downside of not being able to target the weak spot you probably should be hitting balances out the usefulness imo.
ArmoredWarfare,37lbom,Gerbils74,-2,Thu May 28 20:31:07 2015 UTC,It amazes me that people can't do the simplest things to figure something out. It's literally the exact same as wot

ArmoredWarfare,37l7zp,Mobile_Artillery,1 point,Thu May 28 23:31:51 2015 UTC,Very fast and deadly. But to harm t3 MBTs you have to shoot them in the sides/rear. It's my favorite tank so far.  Edit: Just to add some numbers. 45 rounds in the magazine @ 28 damage means 1260 damage without reloading.
