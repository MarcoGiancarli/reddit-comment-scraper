lastweektonight,3dwtuy,lichorat,2,Mon Jul 20 07:07:27 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem with giving things away is the shelf life. If it goes to a pantry but needs to be used soon, it won't work out. They need things that can last in case it doesn't get taken immediately. Shelters where they serve meals are better equipped, but unless there is enough to serve lots of meals, there is little point because they need enough to go around otherwise they're preparing lots of different items which takes more time and resources. It is very had to find the right balance."

lastweektonight,3dwtuy,crownjewel82,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:28:48 2015 UTC,Charities have to store the food and then they need to know what's in it for the sake of people with health conditions. It's a pain in the ass but there are reasons for those rules. There are two things you might be able to do about it though. The first is to write letters to your elected officials and explain your experience. The second thing is that you may be able to give some kind of coupon to charities that their clients can use to pick up food directly from you. Maybe something that lets people come in towards the end of the day and get a loaf of bread for free. That way they don't have to deal with rules on storing food but you can still give stuff away.

lastweektonight,3d30e9,not-drowning-waving,6,Mon Jul 13 07:07:02 2015 UTC,"The Stadium situation in Australia is completely different though. particularly in the AFL where individual teams have almost no say where they play, and State Governments have made it clear they wont fund individual stadiums for most sides. In Melbourne, the 9 professional football sides play out of two stadiums, one of which is completely privately owned with no state funding, the other is also home to Cricket, and is mostly funded by the grounds memberships and the AFL.  In Adelaide, two professional football teams and cricket share the same same stadium that has been immensely successful by all counts. Perth will be the same when its complete.  In Sydney and Brisbane, the AFL shares facilities with Cricket, and League, Union and Soccer all use the same facilities.  In the case of the MCG, Adelaide Oval, Gabba and the new perth stadium, naming rights arent permitted to be sold at all. Councils have almost no input of funding into major stadiums - funding comes from state and federal governments, and generally retain ownership and management of medium size stadiums in NSW and Victoria."

It's also where you occasionally get to watch a test match, T20, the odd shield final when the MCG is busy. Meanwhile our state government pays for Hawthorn to visit and play on a ground owned and operated by the Launceston City Council.  Also the MCG gained revenue  of $10,000,000 from the Victorian government during 2012-14 for the Great Southern Stand. Also they don't appear to have to pay tax neither does any AFL club as unlike the rest of the world our professional sporting teams don't pay income tax on their profits. NRL clubs found themselves investigated by the Australian Tax Office when someone thought to treat their league clubs as an entertainment venue."
lastweektonight,3d30e9,not-drowning-waving,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:29:08 2015 UTC,"Hobart City Council also believes that the money is repaid by Tourism to Hobart, and we're talking a literal million dollars every two years. The State Government has released reports saying similar about its Hawthorn arrangements in Launceston.  The MCG is owned by the MCG Trust, which is an arm of the Victorian Government. it is operated by the MCC who pay an annual fee to the MCG Trust for that purpose. Further the AFL also pays 7 million a year indexed against CPI for ground improvements - on top of rental costs. Its worth noting that the 10 million is about a third of the total cost of the Southern Stand Improvements for a stadium that is a massive contributor to the Victorian economy by virtue of the 3 million people who go there every year - by far the best attendeded venue in Australia.  League clubs dont pay tax on profits - because they are legally not for profit entities (as is the AFL) - and indeed many of them are not profitable."

Generally because the national leagues (AFL, NRL, CA and FFA) are all involved in the process from day 1.  Further the Bloods didnt threaten to move to Sydney.

One of the reasons stadia don't lead to economic growth is because they don't increase consumption (which drives a demand-based economy). Instead of spending money at the bowling alley, bar, movie theater or restaurant, people will spend their money on game tickets instead. Sports stadia don't magically increase people's disposable income. All they do is shift money around.. they don't actually generate new consumer spending. If you want to stimulate the economy, hire some teachers, build some roads, and put money in people's pockets so that they can spend and grow the economy."
