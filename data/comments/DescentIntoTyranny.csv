Kids should not be an exception. In fact, they should be more strictly regulated if anything since kids don't know what they are doing.  However, the solution given by the police, to arrest everyone impartially, though fair and reasonable, is not in my opinion the best solution.  The best solution is to get rid of these laws altogether. Let people sell lemonade regardless of their age. The arguments about spoilage are absurd. Lemons are acidic and lemonade doesn't spoil easily. I've gotten plenty of shitty moldy lemonade out of dispensers at McDonalds and Arbys and other restaurants that are fully licensed. I've never gotten shitty moldy lemonade from a kid since they always make a fresh batch each morning rather than try to save money by not cleaning gear and keeping old stuff around forever like the big licensed and regulated corporations do.  Get rid of regulations. If someone like McDonalds is selling rancid lemonade, have a state tip line that can phone in a raid. Make selling rancid food a serious crime regardless of license state and enforce it severely and without exception. Do not criminalize selling healthy non-rancid food without a license. That's absurd."
DescentIntoTyranny,3d104n,mikemaca,2,Sun Jul 12 22:59:29 2015 UTC,"Laws should not be enforced evenly. No law can ever be written to account for every possible set of circumstances. This is why there are people in charge of enforcing these things. A person can look at a set of circumstances and use logic to decide if the spirit or intent of a law apply to a given situation. In this case yes the lemonade stand violates the spirit of the law but those laws were never intended to apply to a child's lemonade stand. This is where common sense should come into play but nobody wants to take responsibility for their actions. They try to pass the buck and blame the law, I don't buy it."

She told me that she had had her sights set on a trip to the USA to see a niece who was living there and something curious happened.   She had done the middle aged Internet romance thing with some American guy in Arizona. They had even talked about marriage, she had been a widow for ten years already. Then for some reason the internet romance ended. This happened months before she applied for a US Visa. When she went for her visa interview she was denied a Visa. The interviewer asked her about her intentions with the guy on the Internet, using his name. But that communication had ended months before she applied for the VISA.

Soft despotism is different from despotism (also called 'hard despotism') in the sense that it is not obvious to the people.  Soft despotism gives people the illusion that they are in control, when in fact they have very little influence over their government. Soft despotism breeds fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the general populace. Alexis de Tocqueville observed that this trend was avoided in America only by the ""habits of the heart"" of its 19th-century populace.

Allegedly, neighbors were concerned about the large group of black children who were in attendance at the event, and called the police to intervene.   Authorities arrived immediately to the predominately white neighborhood and proceeded to chase and handcuff the frightened partygoers without providing much information as to why. At one point in the clip, an officer can be seen pinning a young girl in a bathing suit facedown into the grass while grabbing her by her braids. She and her friends hysterically scream as she is cuffed.   The adults in the neighborhood are seen helplessly watching on as the girl sobs. All throughout the clip several detained young boys try to explain to the police that they just arrived to the scene and were not involved in whatever complaints had been made. They also appear confused as to why they have been cuffed. The video ends with the officer chastising the boys for “being part of the mob.”"

The President and Congress have had the past 2 years since Snowden to work on reform bills and stop domestic surveillance. Why are they failing us by putting it up to a last minute Senate session?  End the Patriot Act this Sunday May 31st  The fight against the Patriot Act is not over.  Make sure you contact your Senators this week.  They are supposed to be on vacation, but McConnell called for an emergency session on Sunday, May 31st to make a last ditch effort to keep the Patriot Act before it sunsets on June 1st.  If you are against the Patriot Act, tell them to do nothing and let it sunset. No extensions!  Here is a timeline on domestic surveillance since 9/11, from President Bush to President Obama, if you are interested.  Remember, the FBI says the Patriot Act has never stopped terrorism.  According to Rand Paul's filibuster, the NSA has shared domestic surveillance data with the IRS and DEA instead of finding terrorists.  Still, Obama is calling on Congress to do something about the Patriot Act before it is too late!  Tell Obama NO on the Patriot Act and that he also has the power to end domestic spying.  The Freedom Act would not have stopped Domestic Surveillance and Backdoors  In addition to the Patriot Act stuff that's been going on, the Senate narrowly voted down the Freedom Act, which would have stopped some kinds of domestic surveillance, like bulk phone metadata collection, and improve FISA court ""oversight,""  but allowed other forms of domestic surveillance to continue.  You can see a list of how Senators actually voted on this issue here.  This issue seems to be very important to companies that deal with the NSA like Google, since two Google lawyers did an AMA a couple weeks ago on the Freedom Act.  Also remember that the Patriot Act and phone metadata records are just the tip of the iceburg.  For example, people have discovered that the NSA has backdoors in hard drives and Samsung phones.  Obama is being made a fool of by China because of the backdoors.  Have you heard of the Surveillance State Repeal Act?   No one seems to have heard of it, but the Surveillance State Repeal Act is sitting in a committee in the House of Representatives. It has a proper name, unlike ""Patriot"" or ""Freedom,"" and has a goal of demolishing all domestic surveillance data ever collected without a warrant, stopping NSA backdoors, strengthening oversight, and protecting whistle blowers.    This is not about ending spying for National Security. Every country has spies and we need spies too.  But we can push back on domestic surveillance and take steps to limit how our information can be used against us."

Twin Peaks told them to go to hell so the police showed up and prayed all would be well but we're ready if it didn't. Which of those two scenarios sounds the most rational and plausible?"

DescentIntoTyranny,2ym5j4,StringyLow,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:19:41 2015 UTC,"Shall we? It would be weird for me to call your mother mom. Why? Because that's your mother, not mine. Some ways we address each other are contextual and privileged between groups. The context between two black men calling each other the n word is usually friendship. Unfortunately, the context of a white guy calling a black guy the n word is different. Just like it's different when a woman calls her best friend bitch, and when a guy calls a woman a bitch. Just like it's different when someone's talking about the queer community and queer issues, and when a kid yells ""queer!"" at a kid on the school bus. The n word used by blacks has connotations of solidarity in the face of overwhelming oppression, and the n word used by whites has connotations of racism. It's not your fault those connotations exist, but either you have to accept that there are some words you don't have the authority or the cultural capital to use, or, if you choose to use them, accept that people will see you as racist."

DescentIntoTyranny,2ym5j4,bubosa,0,Wed Mar 11 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"so therein lies the context. it's not hypocritical, it's understanding that some people are able to use the word without the racist connotation and some people can't"

I am not a reddit master, actually never even had been on it until less than a week ago.    Several people that read my site suggested it over and over so I posted.  I was a bit taken back by some of the reactions.  lol.   So much so that I am going to post a WARNING next time I post an article, that my site CONTAINS HUMOR. lol.    Apparently a lot of people ONLY want serious serious serious.  Because I poke fun at myself and most everything else while MAKING my point, a small but vocal percentage seem to really dislike it. And tend to simply ignore the points I make. lol.     Look I like to JOKE AROUND.  You know, lighten things up. I have a lot of very hard truths in my material.  Most people just can't handle the truth in large chunks.  Of course if you are ALREADY here you are ready for it.  But sheesh, do we have to only be serious? lol    The situation is what it is.  We are prisoners inside a very complex mind control system on the masses.  Just because I don't grind on it and I make light of it doesn't mean I don't ""take it seriously"", lol.  I mean I have spent years researching and a lot of time writing.    And I am at a loss to understand why some people think that every picture I put up to have a little fun with, is a ""reddit meme"". lol.  I don't even KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.  Isn't ""conspiracy theory"" itself a ""reddit meme""?? lol   I get like 1% of my traffic from Reddit.  My writing is NOT an attempt to ""use the pics"" as click bait. lol.  Don't you have to at least link them or try and drive people to the site with the stuff in order for it to even ""BE"" click bait? lol  I don't do that.  You don't even know they are there until you go to the article, so how is that ""click bait""? I honestly don't get that.  Maybe someone could explain it to me. I am not a webmaster etc. I am a lawyer.   SO LET ME BE CLEAR:  If you ONLY want serious things. And you ONLY think that someone can be ""taken seriously"" if they don't use humor to help make a point then DON'T go to my site.  Is that fair enough?    Honestly, I don't want to waste anyone's time.  There are plenty of other places you can go find something to ""take seriously"".  But my material speaks for itself.  Nothing is for everyone.  We aren't going to Convince ANYONE by hating or being angry THAT DOESN'T Work. And I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it is probably going to get a LOT worse before it gets better, so we might as well LAUGH about our predicament and the absolute foolishness of those who don't see it while we try and fix it.   If you DISAGREE about that, I am totally cool with it. You are welcome to go to another site and honestly, if you find someone who is making THE SAME POINTS I am I would LOVE to know that too.  I want to link his site.  Because the only reason I even STARTED the site is because NOBODY ELSE does make the points I make.    WE are ALL on the same side. lol.  Let's not eat our own.  Let's try and work TOGETHER.   Thanks guys, I wish the best to all."
