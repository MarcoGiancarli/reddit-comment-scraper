downloadcodes,394bc9,tralalove,2,Wed Jun 10 20:11:09 2015 UTC,"Lucky to find a new copy in the record section of Hastings, which apparently nobody browses. Most websites say they're awaiting a repress."
downloadcodes,394bc9,tralalove,2,Wed Jun 10 21:03:48 2015 UTC,That's great luck :) I was so happy when I found one copy at a small local shop a while back. Have you collected any other Animal Collective records?
downloadcodes,394bc9,tralalove,2,Wed Jun 10 22:21:39 2015 UTC,"This is my first. I have Panda Bear's Tomboy and his latest, but excited to hear the other Animal Collective albums. Recommendations?"
downloadcodes,394bc9,tralalove,2,Wed Jun 10 22:48:07 2015 UTC,"Oh wow that is really exciting, they have such a wonderfully impressive discography...I listen to them nearly every day lol. If you haven't already, I'd definitely check out Panda Bear's album Person Pitch. And for AnCo, I'd suggest checking out the Fall Be Kind EP next which came out a few months after Merriweather. Then maybe an older, more acoustic album of theirs Sung Tongs, and if you like that one the Prospect Hummer EP is similarly light and acoustic. And although they're a little harder to get into than MPP or Panda Bear's solo work, Feels and Strawberry Jam are also phenomenal albums and good places to start."

downloadcodes,33w7hx,jfgate,-5,Sun Apr 26 06:14:00 2015 UTC,"Is it too much to post the genre? I don't think so, I did it and it took less than a second. Also the codes get taken very quickly so googling the artist will result in no obtainable music."
downloadcodes,33w7hx,SluttyRonBurgundy,11,Sun Apr 26 06:22:49 2015 UTC,Why are you downloading stuff if you have no idea what it is? Let someone who knows what it is and wants it and will actually listen to it get it.

Using the code blindly is inconsiderate to the person posting the code and those actually interested in the music."

What I'm suggesting is that if a person needs to be told what genre an album is, then maybe they don't know enough about the music to justifiably snatch that precious code up--when someone else who's actually, like, a fan of the band could have it.
