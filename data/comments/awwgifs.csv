He has to eat in the Bailey Chair because his esophagus is enlarged and can't push food down. If he doesn't eat like that he will regurgitate all that food everywhere.   Source: my lab has this
awwgifs,3a31nc,django39,-1,Wed Jun 17 01:28:03 2015 UTC,Or. Or. Maybe the owner of the dog in the gif saw a contraption invented to fill a need (megaesophagus) and thought it would be adorable to train his healthy dog to use a little feeding chair.

There's a photo of him around somewhere of him with candy suckers stuck all in his fur from when she tried to let him hand out Halloween candy.
