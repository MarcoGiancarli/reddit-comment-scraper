We are way off the rails of our birth and feeding plan, but whatever is best for baby. Don't starve her as you figure out breastfeeding. It will come.   Congratulations! It's an awesome ride. I recommend you get a journal and hand-write your late night thoughts as you stay up helping her fall asleep on your chest. I plan to give mine to her when she graduates or gets married or something.  :)"

predaddit,3e34hf,Sapientiam,9,Tue Jul 21 16:22:00 2015 UTC,"My husband has a lot of the same fears you do.  He has zero experience with babies and I don't have a whole lot, either.  You're right, the idea of having a newborn is scary.  But they're not as fragile as you think they are.  Have you seen a neonatal nurse bathe and handle them?  It looks like they're being rough, but the babies take it.  I can tell you want to be a great dad from your post.  That is 3/4 of the battle won!  You're ready to make the tough decisions and help shape your children into good people.  All good parents also want to teach their kids to be brave (I know I do) and that often that means doing the very thing that scares you.  You will make mistakes.  I will make mistakes.  My parents did; my husband's parents did; but we came out alright.  They were doing what they could with the best information they had at the time and love in their hearts.  And it isn't as if you have a newborn delivered to your door at the moment of conception.  You will have more than 9 months to prepare!  Great news, right?  More than 9 months to read everything you can get your hands on; more than 9 months to find other dads, moms, and families to ask questions (because if you are wondering about it, others have, too); more than 9 months to read this board and the many others that can be very helpful.  They aren't helpless babies for very long.  By 4 months most babies can hold their heads up.  By 5 months most can roll over and play with their hands and feet.  By 7 months most can sit up without support.  That's not even as long as your wife will be pregnant!  You can do this and you don't have to do this alone!  You have your wife and your baby's pediatrician (and if you're lucky you have family and close friends, too)."
predaddit,3e34hf,theschmee,5,Tue Jul 21 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"Hey there, recent grad. Daughter born on March 29 so she's coming up on four months. While I won't say I was as scared as you going into this I did have my reservations. I have 3 nieces and 2 nephews. When they were babies I barely interacted with them because I just didn't know how. When they became kids they were (still are) a blast. I was concerned that's how I would be with my own kid, almost absent as an infant just waiting for them to be conscious enough to know what play time is.   Let me say that these first 4 months with her have been absolutely amazing. It's something I never expected because when I use to think of babies I just called them 'unformed sacks of meat that you need to not let die."" While I still feel this is true it doesn't highlight the fact that they are bright, full of wonder and are amazing to watch and be around.  As for your fears about harming your baby: Babies are far more durable then you would believe and will never allow you a second to not react to something wrong with them. You'd have to be willingly negligent to harm a baby. Each cry you will learn what it's for and you'll be able to give what your baby needs, be it food, a change of comfort.   In order to clear up some of your fears you will read, as MUCH as you can. You will read off this subreddit (which was an amazing source to me.) Your wife will pick up a bunch of books, you will read those too. You will start reading blogs about parenting and you will probably go to these parenting lessons at the hospital. You will fill yourself with knowledge to be prepared. You will ALSO take ALL advice with a grain of salt (especially from other parents, your parents, your in-laws etc.) Babies you will learn are people, nuanced, subtle and will react differently with different situations. Your baby will be a part of you (and your wife.) That knowledge there make you the most suitable person to take of this life because you weird ticks and personality traits are in your kid even as a young infant.   Babies aren't mindless beings that are trying to put themselves into harms way. And while they will be difficult to control you will learn how to. You'll learn to react to every moment he/she suddenly jerks backward when you're holding her. You'll learn which ways he/she will prefer to roll while on the floor and make sure she isn't going to bump into something that will hurt them. And as you build routines into your life you will learn how to keep them safe and content. I use to hold my baby clutch to my chest like Gollum holding the one ring. Now I carry her around with one arm, picking up stuff off the ground, shooing away our cats and playing the occasional video game.  My ultimate take away from my experience is this: you were built for this. You were made for this. You don't know it but a lifetime of knowledge is inside you to deal with this. You'll suddenly realize things you wouldn't, those 'fatherly instincts' are not a lie, when the situation comes you will rise to it. This is from a self professed 'man child' whose friends and family are always saying 'wow you're really good with her!' when they see me with my daughter (which i actually find semi insulting but that's for a post on daddit...)   And while you and your baby won't be riding bikes, discussing school or having tea parties you'll have your own magical moments. Much smaller, more personal, like the first time they tightens their arms around you for a hug, the fact that they cry when you turn off the music you've been playing, the excitement in their face when they see you have the bottle, napping together on a lazy weekend afternoon or just the look on their face as they see awe in everything in the world.   My TL:DR for this is that no one is ready to be a parent and to think that is foolish. But do no underestimate what you know, your own experiences and how all of that is buried deep inside you waiting for the moment you become a dad to burst out. So long as you don't freak out once you're thrown into the world of fatherhood you'll realize you know a lot more then you think you do. What you don't know you'll learn that you are much quicker to pick things up then you ever thought you'd be. And you'll be amazed and overjoyed with every moment of it. Or at least I have."

predaddit,3e34hf,sketchedy,5,Tue Jul 21 17:55:44 2015 UTC,"Those baby fears (at least handling them) go away day 1 after you do it for a couple of hours. And while a first baby is a little package of giant worries, the fact that you are worried means you'll be a conscientious parent."
predaddit,3e34hf,sovnade,4,Tue Jul 21 18:14:38 2015 UTC,"Babies arent as fragile as you make them out to be. After a while you learn to relax. Dont drop them on their necks or anything, but theyre going to bump their heads, hit themselves in the face with toys, fall over, play with dog drool covered pacifiers, and theyll be just fine."
predaddit,3e34hf,pfafulous,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:59 2015 UTC,"I am a total klutz. My legs are different lengths and I tend to move without thinking. I've even fallen down the staircase in my house. I'm always covered in bruises from bumping into shit.  My little girl is 11 days old, and I've never been more aware of my environment, or ready for potential hazards. I was a little nervous the first few days, but it's all smooth sailing now.   There is no self-destruct button. Just don't poke it with a pen or nail or whatever. You can hold their heads.   It sounds as if you like and want kids. You'll be amazed the changes you instantly make to your lifestyle and house within a week of that baby popping out.  Take the plunge!"
predaddit,3e34hf,ballistic90,3,Tue Jul 21 19:02:45 2015 UTC,"First, statistics demonstrate that nature is a much bigger factor than nurture. The people that devote every hour to their kids don't see nearly as much ROI than you would think. You dont need to sweat a lot of the little things.  Second, babies arent as fragile as you might imagine. They require a lot of care and attention, but can handle some bumps with some crying and that's it.   Finally, it's highly unlikely that you will conceive on the first try, and even if you did, 9 months is a long as time. You'll be ready by the time it comes."

predaddit,3e34hf,ikdutak,2,Tue Jul 21 21:10:02 2015 UTC,"Babies are actually not that bad. I was the same way before. Whenever a friend would have a baby, I would politely decline holding it for fear of breaking it. And I'll admit, I was that way when our son was born too for the first day or 2. My advice is spend as much time after the baby is born holding them, getting used to them. Ours felt like it had a trial period of sorts. He didn't wiggle around too much, was typically nice, and slept a lot. I used that time to get used to holding him and how he moves to counter act any sudden movements, which thankfully were few and far between lol. We're at a week now and he's moving around a lot more, but because I'm used to it, it's not so scary. Also I find sitting while I'm holding him makes it a lot easier. Pardon my scatter brained response though lol. I'm not great with words haha. Good luck to you though! I can honestly say it's the best experience you can go through. There are tough times, but you move through them to get to the good ones again."

We're due in December, and though I'm really excited, I'm also still completely terrified for the exact reasons you listed and feel almost exactly the same way.   That doesn't really serve much purpose other than to say that you're not alone, and that when it happens I bet you'll be thrilled (if no less terrified!), but there are plenty of us right there with you, man!"
predaddit,3e34hf,capnheim,2,Wed Jul 22 01:51:34 2015 UTC,"5 month old son here.  I was thinking most babies were ugly and did not want much to do with them.  Mine, however, is the cutest baby in the world, and now most of the others are pretty cute too.  You are somewhat limited in what you can do with them, but it's all good.  They really aren't hard at all, you just will be jet-lagged for a few months.    Babies are durable too.  I've dropped mine a couple times from about a foot.  He grabs things, and I wasn't always prepared for him to stop moving when I picked him up.  I learned to adjust my grip, and now he's less likely to pull himself out of my grasp.  It also turns out that you don't allow the baby around dangerous stuff much.  The hard things mine is around are: tub, crib, wall by changing table.  The biggest risk is when you pick him up at 2 AM and you aren't fully coherent.  Still, 2 hands, or better yet, a forearm and a hand leaning him to the chest, and you're super secure.    It is really amazing to hold your baby and make them laugh, or have them smile at you, or simply to sleep on you.  Most people I talk to long for their children to be infants again."

A few weeks before we had our little girl we visited friends with a newborn, he wasn't interested in holding him, he didn't like the idea of holding someone else's fragile baby.  He is a natural with our baby, he can sooth her, he's comfortable holding her, even when she's nude or slippery in the bath. You get over that fear pretty quickly because you have to.  Also the husband of my friend with the newborn, he's got no baby experience, but you wouldn't know it looking at them. He was burping and settling the baby, changing nappies, and he looked like an expert after just two weeks. You have no choice but to learn quickly."

predaddit,3e34hf,chrimpton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:54 2015 UTC,"I graduated last night, and am sitting in the hospital room waiting for my boy to come back from the nursery....here is my take.  Two years ago I was absolutely against having a baby. The thought of the sleepless nights while he was a newborn, the crying, diapers, etc just did not seem even remotely interesting. Not only that trying to pay for college these days is pretty much damn near impossible.   Then my wife sat me down and talked about ways we could cut out monthly budget down to where she could become a stay at home mom. I am aware that we are very fortunate to be in the position, but the idea of my wife wanting to give up her career and all of the work she put in getting certifications, etc really spoke to me. My gut always told me she would be a great mom, I just never knew if I would be a good dad and that truly scared me.   I trusted her and we took that leap to her staying at home and we started trying. Six months later she was pregnant.  I talked to my son in my wife's belly all throughout the pregnancy. I redid the guest room and made it into his room. I went through being scared waiting for test results from genetic testing, ultrasounds, etc. it scared the piss out of me every time we had to wait on results, I would get so stressed out I wouldn't sleep.   I guess what I am trying to say is that you never really feel ""ready"". You have to feel that you can handle it, and have a lot of trust in your parter to be stronger in areas that you may be weaker in and vice versa. I will tell you looking at it from the other side it is completely worth it; I wouldn't trade my son for the world."

It wouldn't have been an emergency c-section; if the procedure didn't work and the baby was still head up at 38 weeks, the OB would have scheduled it, meaning you'd get to pick your baby's birthdate, and it would have been a short procedure before you're whisked off to recovery.  That was our experience at least."
predaddit,3e1jgc,AlphaAnt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:52:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah our practice seems to be the opposite—they'll do everything they can to avoid a section, to the point that at the last minute my wife actually questioned whether doing the ECV was the right thing, or if it was just part of their ""vaginal delivery or bust"" agenda.  She made the mistake of reading something on the Internet about these things...  By the emergency c-section comment, I means that something could go wrong during the procedure itself—not that it might not work (which, of course, is another possibility).  Dislodging the placenta, a problem with the umbilical cord, etc.  They do the procedure in the hospital so that they can go straight into the OR and yank that baby out of there if there are any signs of distress during the flip."

At my 11 week ultrasound where I had my first sonogram and heard the heart beat all that jazz they did a breast exam and also found a huge lump on my left breast by my arm pit.     It completely ruined the whole experience for me and of course they wrote me a script to go have a breast ultrasound done.   I had to wait almost two weeks for the appointment and then wait even longer for official results. There was absolutely nothing they could find. The results came back as having ""dense breast tissue"" which is what young, healthy breasts should consist of. (not sure of your girlfriends age) but anywayyyyyy I found out from my mommy baby bumps sub that usually breast exams are not performed when you are pregnant because your breasts start getting really lumpy from the hormones and prepping for milk to come in as soon as you see a positive on that little pee stick. So really she VERY WELL could be worrying about absolutely nothing.   As far as your other emotions I know that often times it doesn't really click for the guy (dad) the reality of the pregnancy until the baby is actually born. So my advice to you is to just read up a little so she doesn't feel alone in all this and try and talk things out as much as possible. You will have MANY ups and downs and her hormones will often times get the best of her but the more involved you are the easier it will be on all THREE of you.  GOOD LUCK!"

predaddit,3dypds,timab25,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:25 2015 UTC,Be prepared for anything. We had a bunch of newborn diapers and then my son was born at almost 11 lbs. he never fit into newborn. He went to straight to size 1.
predaddit,3dypds,Sunsparc,2,Wed Jul 22 01:21:59 2015 UTC,"Wife and I like Luvs and Pampers, though Luvs are about half the price. We tried out the store brands like Target's ""Up And Up"" and Walmart's ""Parent's Choice"", but they don't seem to hold up as well."

My son wasn't is newborns for very long, but my niece was in them for a while. Diapers are easy enough to buy that I wouldn't worry too much about stocking up early. If you're worried about having the money for them I've heard other dads say they put money on gift cards that they set aside specifically for diapers that way the money is saved.  As for brands, we have liked Target's Up and Up and Pampers. We didn't have much luck with Huggies, but my SIL uses them as her preferred brand. Parent's Choice by Walmart are terrible especially for a newborn. I can't tell you how many times I ripped the tabs off trying to change the diaper of a wiggly baby. When you need 3 diapers for a single change you're not really saving money. I'll also add the overnight diapers really do absorb more so you don't have to change them in the middle of the night as often so they get back to sleep quicker."
predaddit,3dypds,Shtevenen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"had good luck with pampers swaddlers for him.  unlike huggies, they didnt leak  also, buy your diapers, just dont open the box til you need them, any big retailer will take them back or exchaange for the correct size  as far as wipes, kind of like the honest company ones, they arent as wet, but they seem to do a decent job  cant beat kirkland brand for price on wipes tho"

After the first day I took a onesie and a blanket that smelled like the baby home and introduced the dog to the scent and gave him some treats and pets. When the baby came home he was happy and curious to meet the familiar scent.   My daughter is 10 months old, crawling around and tugging on the dog... even pulling out the occasional tuft of fur and he could care less. He also miraculously has learned the difference between baby stuff and dog toys.... we haven't lost a single baby thing to the dogs jaws."

predaddit,3doezf,PASSO3058,3,Fri Jul 17 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"holy crap, that's one extensive list!  a few changes I'd make to help you make you feel like you're not carting half your worldly possessions with you. However, I know we're all different, so please feel free to go ""yeah thanks"" even though in your head you're thinking ""whatever, dickhead"" ...  (this is also based on the fact that I'm Australian, so our hospitals may have a different approach to how they deal with births, and what they supply and expect. At our hospital, the mama and baby stay for 2 nights or 3 if it's a C-section. Dad's visiting hours are from 8am-8pm, and everyone else 2.30pm-8pm. Then after you all go home, you're provided with a home-care nurse who comes visits you at home once a week for the first month)   i wouldn't bother with the shaving kit. Who gives a shit if you've got a little bit of stubble. Some things are more important. Same with shampoo and conditioner.  wear the extra layer of clothes if you need to, although most hospitals in my experience aren't really that cold. same with the shoes; just wear the comfortable shoes (i realise circumstance may not always allow though) i don't think the deodorant can is an issue. Unless you're using half a can at a time, and then spraying the other half into the baby's face, I don't think they'll mind. misc snacks: chances are there's probably somewhere nearby you can get stuff, to save you adding to the bag. Plus she may not want what she's asked for - A good friend of mine isn't a sweet tooth, but after she had her baby, had a weird hankering for anything sweet and filled with sugar. dunno why. First Aid Kit - you're going to be in a hospital, is it really necessary? nail clippers. Are they necessary too? How quickly do baby's nails grow in the first few days?   I've also got a laptop with a pair of headphones, and a 32GB memory stick full of my wife's favourite TV shows and movies that I'll be bringing the next day once she's in her room. Also, don't rely on hospital wifi to be good/available.  My biggest advice: if you haven't put the car-seat in yet, DO IT RIGHT NOW. Those things can be a sonnovabitch to put in. Even if you do it right, you'll still look at it, and pull it in various directions and think ""hmmm, is that right? That doesn't seem right"" even though it is."

Sprout is a baby schedule tracker, you can easily record baby's feedings, wet and dirty diapers, medical info (height and weight gains and losses) and sleep patterns. It was one that cost money (under $5) but invaluable for those first weeks when you are trying to anticipate when baby wants to eat next or can't remember which side you last breastfed on. Also the doctors (and lactation consultants) are going to want this info when you are in the hospital (which we were for a week) and at the first appointments"

predaddit,3dnj14,newdadz,6,Fri Jul 17 18:40:21 2015 UTC,"Not my favorite list. I wish he had an optional category or something. I could argue with like half of his choices.   A sophia/teething necklace is $15 and was huge for our kid and my niece and nephew. For something relatively affordable, it's a huge disservice to dismiss it offhand. Baby care timer not required, pen and paper works just fine too,  but not everyone has a smart phone so it's good for some new parents to have. Baby towels, not required, but nice to have. And lots of them can be hilarious/cute. Worth the $10 to me. Bassinet - depends on the baby. Some kids don't like cribs for whatever reason, but will sleep in a bassinet. For the first few months your sleep is worth the money if you can afford it. Don't dismiss it out of hand. Baby swing - again, depends on the baby. For what is a pretty expensive item ($100-$300) I wouldn't automatically get it. It worked great for our kid, but my niece nephew hated it.  Video monitor - I would argue it's optional at best. Never felt the need for one, but some might find it useful. Baby bath tub - you can wash babies in the sink or tub, but good lord is it so much easier with a baby bath tub.   I could go on, but safe to say this is not a hard and fast list. Take it with a grain of salt."

Every second spent looking at your baby is a second spent not looking at the road. Dangerous situations on the road require split-second thinking. When you're not looking at the road and have to come back, not only do you not have the information that was available when you were looking at your baby, you brain also needs to re-orient itself to the overall scene.  I guarantee you that you're not a good enough driver to handle that, because nobody is. Your baby is safest when your full attention is on the task at hand.

I kept reminding my wife that newborns sleep constantly, and she has a pre-newborn in there. They sleep even more. Just keep saying the baby is healthy and fine.

The time goes quicker than it seems at times!  We had a doppler which worked great for us, our little girl had a good heartbeat, easy to find. We got if off our friends who are both nurses, so they showed us how to use it properly, we were better at it than some of the midwives by the end. The important thing is to be confident about how to use it and be aware that if you ever can't find the heartbeat, it is not a reason to freak out unless other more tangible symptoms are also occuring. More likely if you can't find it, you are using the doppler wrong or baby is in a bad position (to find the heartbeat).   I loved to fall asleep listening to my unborn baby's heartbeat, it is really cool.   Good luck with everything!"

predaddit,3dltqx,UnicornToots,3,Fri Jul 17 13:29:53 2015 UTC,"Pregnant lady here.  What held me over during the dreamy, symptom-free 2nd trimester were:   Going to doctor's appointments because I could hear the heartbeat then. Between doctor's appointments, I would measure my bump as it got bigger. It was nice seeing growth, and that was my way of saying things were progressing. Finally feeling kicks at around 21 weeks (though most people start feeling it earlier).   I know you were hoping to hear the heartbeat yourself, but at 16 weeks you definitely will not. The baby is still very small and your ear isn't as sensitive as a doppler. I didn't buy a home doppler because I knew that if I couldn't find the heartbeat myself (because, from what I hear, it can be tricky) I would start to freak out. So I just used the visual of me growing and the eventual kicks of the baby to let me know between appointments that everything was going just fine.  So, just talk to your wife more about how she's feeling. Maybe she's started feeling flutters (early baby kicks) or is getting kicks to the cervix. Round ligament pain is a good sign because it means her uterus is growing, so keep that in mind. Take photos of her weekly to see her bump growing so you know things are progressing. You'll be fine. :)"

If you don't notice anything, then there is a very, very high chance that everything is good!  Sort of a, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" idea.  Pregnancy is a normal thing for her body to do, so she's probably feeling pretty normal at this point.  If she feels abnormal, than something might be wrong and it's worth talking to the doctor about.  There's a good chance she'll start feeling movement in the next month or so, and once that starts it's a good reassurance!"

There's nothing wrong with getting a scan if you want, but you'll also be surprised how quickly this part goes by.   Also, there's this sub full of dudes going through the same thing, so sometimes venting to strangers can also help"

The second trimester was hard and easy for those exact reasons; my wife was feeling physically better so we could do more but the lack of symptoms makes you a bit anxious.  Our monthly OB appointments were reassuring, and once the baby starts moving a lot you'll know everything is fine.  Don't worry so much, like someone else said if anything was wrong your wife would feel it.  As for the heartbeat thing, my wife is 39+ weeks and I still can't hear a thing so I don't know if I would expect that at any point.  In fact, the last time I tried my son kicked me in the head, almost to say ""stop worrying dummy!""  We didn't want to wait until our 20 week anatomy scan to find the sex, so around 16-17 weeks we went to one of those 3D scan places.  I was nervous to do it at first but it was great.  It was totally professional, clean, and it gave us some peace of mind knowing what the sex was a few weeks early.  Might be something to consider, if you're comfortable with it."

As for the things that allow you to hear the babies heart beat I'd advise against it. We bought one and it was terrible. It wasn't the cheapest one or anything it just wasn't able to pick anything up until late in the pregnancy and even then it had a lot of feedback. What I would recommend if you have the money is one of those 3D ultra sound places. We found out the gender of our child at 13+6! And it was 100% accurate. Most of the places like that can do accurate gender predictions at 14 weeks. We wanted to start getting stuff so we found out as soon as possible and it was a great decision a d would recommend it to anyone. They even gave us a video, loads of HD photos, and a bear that had a recording of the babies heart beat when you squeezed it."
predaddit,3dltqx,rosekayleigh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:52:57 2015 UTC,I've mentioned this a few different times when threads like these pop up. My wife has horrible anxiety so pregnancy was rough. What REALLY helped was purchasing a pocket Doppler for home. Whenever my wife was feeling anxious we would bust it out and listen to our baby's heartbeat.
predaddit,3dlr37,sniperjohn,3,Fri Jul 17 08:14:29 2015 UTC,I get a week. A freaking week. I'm probably lucky to even have that. Hate this society's view on fathers.

Far less stress, marginally less childish behaviour to deal with. Makes me happier to see my kids when I get home instead of sick of their bullshit."
