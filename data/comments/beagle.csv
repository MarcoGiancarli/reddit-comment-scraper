beagle,3dkmsn,littlehamsterz,2,Fri Jul 17 01:07:15 2015 UTC,"Now just wait a minute here. Please don't listen to these sensationalist news articles tugging at your heart strings.  I am a veterinary student and personally own a retired laboratory beagle. She was always well taken care of and well fed. Stellar veterinary care as well. She goes bananas every time she sees the veterinary researchers that used to work with her. She loves them! Do you think if she was ""tortured"" she would have this kind of reaction? She is well socialized with people if only a bit skittish around other dogs. She is a sweety pie and wonderful as can be. Her contributions to science are not small or insignificant in the least. Her life as a research beagle was useful and humane unlike the lives of many stray dogs that will never know warmth, kindness, or human interaction.  Where do you think every scientific advancement used in the human and veterinary medical fields comes from? You absolutely must test every potential drug on an animal first or it can never be proven safe.  There are strict regulations regarding the humane care and use of laboratory animals. Yes, they live in cages but the cages have regulated minimum sizes and typically are large runs. They have required weekly exercise (aka enrichment). While it would be ideal to not use animals for testing, it is necessary if we ever hope to have new drugs on the market.  We can't very well test on orphan children or homeless people. Animals are the next most reliable alternative."

beagle,3d325q,too__legit,3,Mon Jul 13 05:47:58 2015 UTC,"There's a list of hundreds of potential adopters and fosters.  The key is being local to a rescue as traveling can be hard on these guys.  After an interview, you'll do a home walk-through and hopefully get on the approved list.  When a rescue happens near you, you'll get a call and hopefully get a new beagle in your life.  Some of them can be difficult.   They haven't known life outside of a   lab and are likely to be fearful of humans and not housebroken.  Many are traumatized and take months or years to open up to being around people.  They may suffer medical issues for the rest of their life.  But the reward is incredible and worth it."

Some reptiles, birds, and sharks have full nictitating membranes; in many mammals, a small, vestigial portion of the membrane remains in the corner of the eye. Some mammals, such as camels, polar bears, seals and aardvarks, have full nictitating membranes. Often called a third eyelid or haw, it may be referred to in scientific terminology as the plica semilunaris, membrana nictitans or palpebra tertia.

beagle,3ckf5z,melcippy,2,Thu Jul 16 23:18:27 2015 UTC,"We raised our beagle to be off leash. However when he was still a youngster and my dad and brother had him on a trail in the mountains he spotted a dear and bolted after it. No amount of searching or calling could get him back. After a couple hours it was getting dark and my family returned home, to our horror, without Muddy ((the beagle)). Thankfully we got a call a little later from a biker who Mudd had found and started following. Even though he'd been a good walker, I'll never take a chance with a beagle again."

She isn't fond of it, and will sometimes paw at her face to get it off if she thinks we're not giving her an appropriate amount of sniff time somewhere. It definitely has helped make our walks be more walk like. If she's been sniffing for a little to long the gentle leader helps to get her back into walk mode, though she tends to not be too happy about it. I also like that it helps us prevent her from picking up all the tasty treats she seems to find along the side of the road."

It's good to be able to guide/nudge him away from a smell/trail when necessary (like a car is coming and you can't just stand in the middle of the street with your nose to the ground, buddy). If we walk him without the harness and just use a regular collar he will pull like crazy when he smells something good - with Easy Walk he has learned that it doesn't work and we can walk loose-leash pretty easily.   I'm not into how the gentle leader is on the dog's face. I can't imagine my pup being comfortable in it."

beagle,3cgjf3,AredLion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:41:19 2015 UTC,I couldn't help but notice the choke collar. Choke collars can be a really bad idea for beagles. They tend to lunge forward when they find a sent and many can't really turn off that instinct. This instinctual response can cause pretty severe damage to the throat when using a choke collar. No pull harnesses are a safer option when training a puppy to walk on a leash.
beagle,3cgjf3,delicatefemaleflower,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:48:43 2015 UTC,"well my pup does not pull because i have trained her that way i also have trained her not to bark or howl. She only does this when we are playing. First of all a Choke collar is not bad for dogs its how people use them that's bad for dogs. You must understand how the choke collar works, the dog pulls on the leash and the collar tightens. Instinctively no dog will willingly hurt itself so i simply learns not to pull or jump. People tend to hurt their dogs by applying a lot of force and pull back when their dogs are jumping at something. I have had many hunting dogs and since the beagle is a hunting dog naturally, i train her like one so that she behaves."
beagle,3cgjf3,delicatefemaleflower,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:02:51 2015 UTC,May I ask how you trained her not to bark or howl? I understand its a beagle trait but my boy does it excessively and Im trying to correct it but nothing is working.

beagle,3ajv0j,goos_momma,2,Mon Jun 22 19:51:08 2015 UTC,I had a ballsy little dude who would steal pizza off your plate if you weren't paying attention (eg plate in your lap and you turn your head to talk to someone). I miss that fat sneaky bastard. ;(
beagle,3ajv0j,goos_momma,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"My families beagle used to do that when I was growing up. But to her defense she was picked up in the wild with puppies and never was able to be tamed. She was good for the most part. I got this babe from a puppy mill :( after failed pregnancy. She's just so good. I can leave a full meal at her head level, go to a different room for 20 mins and she will leave it. That's not to say she always is naughty once I'm asleep. Can't fault her; that pizza is amazing."

beagle,3akd47,swimbikerunrun,4,Sun Jun 21 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"I never would. I just went from coming home every day on lunch and walking them to a different job where there's no way I can do it. Their main walk comes in the morning now.  They are definitely in the crates longer then I'd like.   That said, my mom helps out, comes by midday occasionally to let them out.  The nice thing is yours is older and probably won't need as much exercise as he's already slowing down.   The worst thing for your beagle (aside from being put down of course) would be getting abandoned. That's essentially how he'd feel if he was rehomed and it could cause issues.   My oldest is 12. We got her when she was 5. We were her fifth known owners including the foster who she kept going back to. It shows to. She had horrible separation anxiety. If she even thinks I'm leaving, she gets terrified.   My middle one.. Well, she was the non at a puppy mill..different story entirely.  My youngest got lucky. He was adopted by a guy in the area. Kept getting out. Showed up in my yard one day. Reunited him only to get s call a couple weeks later asking if we wanted him because they couldn't handle their dogs and a baby. He had far less issues then the other two, but he gets out of the fence occasionally and I think he's still trying to make his way back.   You need to hold on to your precious beagle for the duration. You'll regret doing anything else and it'll destroy your dog emotionally if you do otherwise.  My 2c"

beagle,39tsww,5secondstozerotime,2,Tue Jun 16 08:51:04 2015 UTC,The Frosty Paws just upset the cocker spaniel/lab's stomach. Nothing horrible. I just felt bad because it was supposed to be made for him.  The ice cream my beagle is eating is supposed to be made for dogs. Not sure what my local ice cream place uses to make it though.

beagle,39urr0,swedishberry,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:24:00 2015 UTC,I tried a few harness and this one from Ruffwear feels more secured and durable then the others. My little dude seems to like it. He knows what's coming once I pick it up. Nothing but tail wagging goodness.
beagle,39urr0,swedishberry,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't love about it is the flat buckle snaps, they constantly need to be tightened. It gets loose and then less effective. But, that's true of any collar/harness with a flat buckle."
beagle,39urr0,swedishberry,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:33:49 2015 UTC,People have told me he is pretty small for a beagle so on the harness I just tighten everything all the way. It sits a little loose enough for me to have a finger or two between the harness and him. I haven't notice the flat buckles getting loose. Then again I've only taken him out on hikes/runs a few times. He needs more outdoor time for me to break in the new gear.  🐶

beagle,39n6zk,RobieWan,4,Fri Jun 12 23:32:08 2015 UTC,Our beagle was 11 and passed from lymphoma last year.  In his last month you could tell something was up because he wanted more space than normal but was still very playful and energetic.  He went downhill in about 5 days.

beagle,39lfag,4x4prints,3,Fri Jun 12 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"I don't have an answer, but recently /r/dogs had an ask-a-groomer thread and they said too much shedding could be related to diet, so ask your vet!  And they recommended a kong zoom-groom rubber brush.  I had tried a bunch of brushes and nothing seemed to gather the hair, and I guess beagle hair is just short and straight and not incline to stick to a brush (which is good for hunting in underbrush!) so the best bet when grooming is to do a little bit at a time but more often.  And this is good practice for a puppy anyways; you probably won't get in more than 30 seconds at a time at that age.    I also find that leaving a fleece around for the dog tends to collect the fur on its own!    And that puppy is sooo adorable!"

beagle,39lfag,shadith,3,Fri Jun 12 17:57:35 2015 UTC,"I use a furminator and try to brush once a week or so.  I also give pretty solid body rubs with my fingertips that loosen a lot of the shed, then I pet it down their bodies and collect it in my hand to throw it away.  They love the rubs, I suspect its a bit like a massage for them.  Even my nervous little man, Zepp grins at me when I do it."
beagle,39lfag,badbluemoon,3,Fri Jun 12 17:20:45 2015 UTC,"We use a Furminator on our boy - and we do it outside! For a pup, I'd use something like a rubber brush. Our dude is shed-happy right now with the warmer weather."
beagle,39lfag,squinzey,3,Fri Jun 12 17:23:16 2015 UTC,"Awe she is very cute. Im a groomer and i have worked at a vet, someone already recommended kong zoom groom rubber brush which is exactly what i use on my beagle mix and what i would recommend here as well. As far as the shedding, most deff prob a diet issue. You dont need to go to the vet for that just switch her food gradually. I would recommend something like wellness, merrick, nutro ultra, or natures variety, something like that just to name a few. Hope this helps!"
beagle,39lfag,sesquiup,2,Fri Jun 12 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your beagle.  I have two beagles, and one of them needs to be brushed fairly regularly, and when I do, he drops a ridiculous amount of hair.  But the other one -- almost nothing.  If your beagle sheds, then some brushing might help.  Get a brush with fat rubber bristles, and go easy at first... beagles are tough puppies, but she's still just a pup.  I think I'll go brush my hairy beagle now.  =)"

beagle,399wxb,MichB1,3,Wed Jun 10 16:19:58 2015 UTC,"They've told us strict rest for two weeks (crated at all times except out on a leash for toilet) and then slowly allowing more freedom out of the crate - slow walking, but no stairs and not off leash. I believe there's to be some physio exercises but I'll find out more about that at her next check up. I'm a bit lucky with her as she's generally not a super energetic dog. So hopefully she'll handle the forced rest a bit better than your porthos!

My femur was broke and my hip was displaced. I ended up in a Mexican cat rescue organization. Some people who were traveling back to Texas rescued me so that I could go to Beagle Freedom Project in Las Vegas. I remained in Texas for 2 weeks over the Christmas holidays with a foster home. Then flew to Las Vegas where they had a fundraiser for me and I under went extensive surgery and rehabilitation. Here I am at DFW Airport flying to Las Vegas. If I look a little scared it's because I wasn't sure what awaited me.  Meanwhile, my Texas foster home lost their Labrador retriever and decided to adopt me. Yesterday they came and got me. The picture you see is me waiting in McCarren airport to return to DFW. You can tell I'm much happier here. Finally, a furrever home.

beagle,390484,pusameow,2,Mon Jun 8 07:28:07 2015 UTC,"Pick up a copy of Dr. Sophia Yin's Perfect Puppy in 7 Days. Regardless of whether you're getting a puppy or adult, you likely won't have a perfect dog in seven days, but you will have a fantastic foundation for setting off on the right foot with your new dog. It goes over materials, training, socialization, handling, exercise, nutrition, and so on. But as far as Beagle-specific advice goes, they're scenthounds bred to follow their nose rather than their handler, so don't let him off leash in an unfenced area. If you want to work on that independence, then work on focus exercises from the start. They're very food motivated, so although this works in your benefit for training, talk to your vet about the nutrition and exercise he needs daily to keep him at a healthy weight. If you're going through a breeder, make sure that you're only supporting a reputable breeder who is performing the necessary genetic testing to ensure they aren't producing dogs who are predisposed to the health issues common in the breed. Especially if you go through a shelter or rescue, however, you may want to consider signing up for pet insurance or putting together an emergency savings fund to ensure you can meet this dog's medical needs on a whim.   Good luck!"
beagle,390484,jldf473,2,Mon Jun 8 15:53:15 2015 UTC,Thanks and im sorry for my late reply!  Im still thinking because my schedule doesnt work well with the people in my place. No one's going to look after the dog for 2 hours while im on my way home. But thanks!!
beagle,390484,jldf473,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:27:14 2015 UTC,Do you mind elaborating on that? How long would the dog be alone per day?
beagle,390484,jldf473,2,Tue Jun 9 14:02:01 2015 UTC,I work from 9am-6pm. My sibs leave the house at 4pm for school. Its a one hour drive from work to home. So my dog would be alone at home from 4-7pm.

beagle,38rklq,RobieWan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:11:31 2015 UTC,Clean it with a tiny bit of gentle soap and water if you're concerned.    Probably nothing to be too worried about unless he seems uncomfortable from it.

beagle,38izon,Balthalzarzo,3,Thu Jun 4 15:15:54 2015 UTC,"http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img538/3859/nrfddV.jpg  A second picture. Any tips? He weighs 26 pounds but if i touch his side I can easily feel his ribs.  Should I put him on a diet/ how much should I be feeding him?  He eats pure balance which is 350 kcal/cup, and he gets 4-5 treats a day at 23 kcal/treat  I was feeding him 2 cups a day + 3-4 treats, so he would average 700-800kcal a day, and he gets atleast a 20minute walk + up to 20-30 minutes of play time per day (sometimes he gets several hours of playtime once every week or so)  also he was recently at the vets and she made no comment about his weight other than after a neuter I have to watch his weight because sometimes beagles can explode, she said he looked in a very healthy shape."
beagle,38izon,yolibobchris,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:17:12 2015 UTC,I would agree with your vet. He looks fine so he probably can handle that much food. If after a neuter you're getting concerned just go to the vet and they should be able to give you some advice.
beagle,38izon,zdaytonaroadster,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:54:07 2015 UTC,"if the Vet doesnt say its a problem, than its not a problem. I got one thats 35lbs and one at 39.5. Vet said the one near 40 could lose a but of weight, but she wasnt that bad for an older girl"
beagle,38izon,picklesanddickles,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"If your dog is at a healthy weight, you should be able to palpate his ribs easily with no fat padding, he should have an hourglass shape when you look down on him from above (a tucked in waist line), and he should also have a belly that tucks up when looking at him from the side which may be a little more difficult to tell because he's a boy.  I always tell clients it's not about a number but more of a look.  If your dog has those characteristics then he's probably doing just fine.  Just monitor his weight after neutering to ensure he doesn't put on much. Check his weight every month or so.  You'll get an idea of the weight your dog should be at to maintain his figure and the amount of food he can have.  My beagle is good at about 26 - 27 lbs and eats about 1.5 cups a day of her GI diet.  When I had her on a store diet she could only have about 1 cup a day.  Just be knowledgeable!"
beagle,38izon,Gustav55,2,Fri Jun 5 01:46:07 2015 UTC,"mine is around 43 pounds the vet said that he should lose a few 35-40 is a good weight for his size, Beagles really have a wide variety for how big they are it depends on how tall they are."
beagle,38izon,poston03,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:11:25 2015 UTC,How much do beagle sizes vary? My girl is 5 and a half months and is about 12 pounds.  The vet says she is perfectly healthy but for some reason she seems very small to me.

beagle,38ffgr,DigeratiMusic,2,Wed Jun 3 21:21:28 2015 UTC,"Huh. Just yesterday we discussed the fact that my dog would rather do just that than go sleep on the sofa because he wants to be where we are (the kitchen, in that case)."

beagle,38du5g,holla5050,2,Wed Jun 3 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"How did you determined what products and ""bad guy companies"" to avoid? I would love to have a list so I can do the same."
beagle,38du5g,HeadBrainiac,3,Thu Jun 4 03:57:27 2015 UTC,I have the Beagle Freedom Project's Cruelty Cutter app on my phone. You can scan any product and it'll tell you if it is cruelty free. I also obsessively read labels because sometimes the app doesn't know. Everything we buy has been determined to be cruelty free. Shower gel is made by Everyone Soap. Toothpaste is Tom's of Maine. Laundry detergent is Ecos from Costco. It's a little bit more expensive and certainly more challenging to find like sunscreen for the kids (Yay for Honest Company by Jessica Alba). But it's totally worth it. We adore our beagle and it breaks my freaking heart to think of her or her beagle cousins being tortured in the name of beauty products or really anything.   You can see a list of companies that test on animals on the Beagle Freedom Project's website - http://www.beaglefreedomproject.org/cruelty_free  You can also check the products for the little bunny symbol on products that mean it is cruelty free - http://www.leapingbunny.org/indexcus.php
beagle,38du5g,holla5050,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:15:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for all the info! When I first saw the BFP video I was astounded / appalled at the mistreatment of these sweet dogs. The fact that they are singled out as test subjects because they are docile and compliant (well, actually that ANY animal is abused this way) makes me want to go hunt down all the company CEOs who made the testing decision in the first place and put them in tiny cages with no freedom. Quid pro quo.  Starting here and now I will become diligent about only supporting and patronizing companies that are cruelty-free.  Thank you again for the education and links!"
beagle,38du5g,Aedeus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:06:27 2015 UTC,"You are welcome. I hope enough people do this and we can put an end to animal testing.   And I agree with testing on the damn CEOs instead! I don't know how those 'scientists"" can go to work - how do you hurt those dogs with those giant sweet, sad, full of suffering eyes and not feel like the worst person on earth?  Oh and I forgot to mention to check your local dollar store. Our Dollar Tree store sells Salon Selective brand shampoo and conditioner which is cruelty free, only $1 a bottle and works great."

Beagle comes with the ball and drops it in my feet, and won't stop until I throw it.  I throw it a couple of times, and the third time, instead of bringing it back and put it on my feet, he pushes it to underneath the couch, then starts crying.  So I go down to the floor to get the ball out, and beagle just sits there, whimpering, as if he had been hurt, because he can't have his ball.  Finally I take it out, and throw it.   Before I can get back up again, beagle comes back with the ball. Only, this time, instead of giving me the ball (now that I'm already on the floor, to prevent him from putting the ball back underneath the couch), he jumps to the couch, and lays right where I had been sitting not 1 minute ago. He's got the ball on his mouth, chewing, sitting on my spot, and I'm sitting on the floor...  This is how I watch sports at home."

beagle,380n2r,deadkenndies48,2,Mon Jun 1 14:15:06 2015 UTC,I can hear the sniffing (:
beagle,381cb5,swedishberry,2,Mon Jun 1 03:21:24 2015 UTC,"I call this ""mountain beagle""  mine sometimes believes he is a goat. I have never found a way to stop this behaviour, so I adjusted the position of chairs and plants accordingly."
beagle,381cb5,MrBitterness,2,Mon Jun 1 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"My beagle doesn't climb so I don't have experience with this. These are just my thoughts and things I've heard or reading in regards to general dog training.  Training him really well with an ""Off"" command and being consistent with it should help.   I make a loud ""Ah"" sound my dog is doing or about to do something naughty. Example, when I brought him home for about a couple weeks he had a liking with a couple pairs of my shoes. I would say ""Ah"" to redirect his attention followed by ""No"" then give him a toy. I know some people use noise makers for the same effect.   Also, I think some people put particular things on their furniture that the dog doesn't like to touch. I'm sure you can buy something, but maybe a quick Google search would bring up some at common home items that might work. That way when you aren't at your desk you can put something on it and the chair that will make him not want to get up there."
beagle,381cb5,ShelinStL,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:13:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the reinforcement he receives from jumping up on the desk/table likely outweighs your verbal correction, and it likely won't stop him when you aren't around- so I'd ditch it. The real question to ask yourself is 'Why is my dog running zoomies so often that it's becoming a problem?' How much exercise is he getting?"
beagle,381cb5,fjed743,2,Mon Jun 1 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"We go on 4 walks a day (live in a condo). You're right his walk lengths may be slacking since I picked up a short term contract for extra work (finished in a week) - however he has been going to doggie day care ~2x a week to help make up for days when I can't take him on his usual run at the park. We have multiple routes for our walks too so they aren't the same one every time.   So, perhaps its an exercise thing, although he is otherwise napping and sleeping his usual amount. I really wonder if he just didn't realize he could get up there before and since I started letting him cuddle behind me while I work, its opened a whole new level for him."
beagle,381cb5,fjed743,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:12:46 2015 UTC,"You know him and his needs better than I, but it absolutely wouldn't hurt to up the exercise. You may also want to consider whether he's actually lacking more in the mental stimulation department rather than the physical. If this is the case, I'd kill two birds with one stone and incorporate a couple short training sessions into his day on teaching him to go to his bed (or crate, mat, etc.). That way you could wear him out mentally while teaching an alternative behavior that you can redirect him to when he jumps on the desk/table (jumps up -> 'Go to bed'). As he learns that lots of fun things happen around his bed, he'll be more inclined to choose to go there in the future (you know, rather than on your coffee table), and if he does decide to jump up onto something you'd rather he not, you can tell him specifically where you'd rather have him."
beagle,381cb5,aftersilence,2,Tue Jun 2 05:27:14 2015 UTC,He does know the 'on your bed' command. Good idea to reinforce that!  I doubled up his walk time last night and we just went for an hour long walk/park play time. I'll also grab a kong wobbler for him since I've been meaning to get him one anyway!
beagle,381cb5,OdinKtcm,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:03:13 2015 UTC,"Oh God, my parents' Beag does this. She is super active and super agile, I really think she was a cat in a past life. We just give a really firm ""NO"" but we have moved everything we can (eg tipped chairs up on their sides etc). Unfortunately if we try and put obstacles in her way she sees that as a fun new challenge. We've had to just accept that there are things she will climb on; fortunately she is an outdoor only beagle so the damage she can do is pretty limited. One day I'm sure she'll fall off something and give herself a hell of a fright, but until then she's unstoppable!"

beagle,37wcon,leelee44268,3,Sun May 31 09:04:26 2015 UTC,Losing a family member is always tough. I am so sorry for your loss. Daisy looks like she was a very happy soul.
beagle,37wcon,HeadBrainiac,2,Sun May 31 13:02:47 2015 UTC,"We had to euthanize our chihuahua last summer and I still can't even think of him without crying (as I am now). He was three years younger than our beagle Darby, who's now 14.   Darbs seems to have aged five years just in the last few months. He walks slowly, sleeps 23 hours a day and is very hard of hearing. (His sniffer still works fine and his appetite is strong as ever!) I know ""that day"" will come eventually, but until then I just love and appreciate him every minute.   I'm sure you made Daisy very happy (and vice versa) and gave her a wonderful life."
beagle,37wcon,heatherlavender,2,Sun May 31 07:40:56 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry and so sad for your loss. I am sitting here with tears in my eyes. Losing a pet is so painful. Looks like your Daisy was such a sweet dog.

beagle,378utu,DrBBQ,1 point,Tue May 26 02:46:21 2015 UTC,"My beagle does the same thing when he wants attention. The problem is if I'm busy he just applies more pressure to that paw until the nails are digging into me (and yes we keep them trimmed).  If that doesn't work, then he will attempt to forcefully remove my hand from whatever else it's doing.  If that fails, he'll work up the most insane volume of slobber and begin to lick my arm until I scratch him.  It's sweet.... but oh so annoying.  Thank God he's adorable."
beagle,376q6j,innle85,8,Mon May 25 09:37:16 2015 UTC,"We aren't sure exactly what happened. She is reaching her elderly years - she's 11, so it's entirely possible she has done it merely going up or down a couple of steps in our yard, or while playing with our other dog, or even just from walking. Unfortunately for her, surgery isn't an option as she has a heart murmur, so we are hoping some alternative treatments will help her remain with good quality of life. I'm hoping to save up some money to get her a nice orthapedic bed, and for the next few months we are working on some physical therapy and strict rest, as well as anti-inflamm medication. It's going to be a long and stressful few months I think, but this girl is worth it."
beagle,376q6j,Kimbobrains,2,Mon May 25 10:48:37 2015 UTC,You should set up some kind of fundraiser for her so you can get what she needs quickly. There's a lot of dog/beagle lovers out there who might help. Hope she feels better.  :)

He won't be able to do walkies again until August, and we're out about $1,200.  He's 12. We figured he's got at least a few more years of running ahead of him (until he blows the other leg), so we went ahead and did the surgery.   Sorry about your girl.

beagle,36ypx0,swedishberry,3,Sat May 23 06:54:22 2015 UTC,Not to mention beagles are prone to pancreatitis which can be caused by eating non dog food items. My beagle had to learn that the hard way after he gorged himself on garbage one thanksgiving.
beagle,36ypx0,skieryne,2,Sat May 23 11:40:32 2015 UTC,"They'll also return to anyone who has ever given them a treat before - my guy knows who has given him treats before at the park and will head right towards them and sit, waiting for a treat. Try to minimize when/who gives them treats."
beagle,36ypx0,Putridgrim,5,Mon May 25 21:18:56 2015 UTC,"Don't try to walk your new baby without a leash.  Beagles are scent oriented and will stop listening to you if they pick up a scent they like, so leash at all times when not in a fenced yard.  They can also be stubborn to train, but with the right treats and patience you can get them to do a lot of stuff.  I would also recommend a harness for walks.  A gentle leader harness would work as well, but I haven't tried that with my girl.  Socialize with other dogs after she gets all of her shots.  Love her and be patient."
beagle,36ypx0,Putridgrim,3,Sat May 23 13:44:53 2015 UTC,"I actually found that a lot of Beagles hate kids. They are patient, they don't snap or anything, but if they get annoyed enough they'll go hide somewhere. Depends on how handsy your kid is. Other than that, Beagles love to kill small furry or feathery animals."

My little dude - my son - is very relaxed and kinda goes with the flow, so I will tell him if she goes to hide leave her be!!  Thank you again for this advice!"

I got Barkley as a puppy first from a local breeder, and after a year I thought he'd like a friend so I got Satchel who is about the same age from a beagle rescue.  Their age, coloring, and breed are almost exactly the same, but they are almost complete opposites in everything else. Despite the personality differences they are still best buds and inseparable.

beagle,36mqzs,foamy117,6,Wed May 20 14:59:18 2015 UTC,"I swear my beagle spends at least 22 and a half hours out of every day asleep. She wakes up and demands her breakfast at 7.30, goes outside to do her stuff, comes back to bed for her post breakfast snooze. An hour or so later she relocates for a sleep under the blanket on the sofa. While I'm teaching piano she curls up on her chair for a few hours. We get an hour or so of excitement around dinner time, then it's back to the sofa to sleep off dinner until bedtime. If it's a nice day some of that sleeping will be relocated to the lawn for some serious sunbaking. We were warned that beagles were adorable bundles of insatiable energy who would need to run marathons every day. Hahaha...nope!"

beagle,36dh21,In_The_News,5,Mon May 18 21:40:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much.   If you don't mind me getting mushy it's kind of funny you say that. Her tumors growing rapidly these past couple weeks, and this morning we woke up to her having seizures at 5:30 AM. We ultimately decided to take her to the vet. On the way, the weather was half sunny half ominous like it was going to thunderstorm later. I had this intuitive feeling that I would see a rainbow today...I don't know why it was just a thought in my head.  After putting her to rest my boyfriend and I drove the awful ride home in tears and pain. Right as we got off the highway and were a few blocks from our apartment, there was a car in front of us with a Hawaii license plate -- a huge rainbow (Ive only seen one once before..and were in Pittsburgh! Random). I kinda felt a little at peace. It ended up raining later and just ended and I kept checking outside for a rainbow. I didn't see one but kept thinking about it through out the day for a piece of mind.  When I was little my dad passed away from a heart attack. When my mom was in the waiting room a lady bug landed on her arm right before she found out the news. We always see ladybugs at the oddest of times.  Well anyways, I don't post on here much. I appreciate your words and if you can tell they meant more to me than you may have thought. Thank you :)"

beagle,35v42j,mattbin,4,Wed May 13 20:53:02 2015 UTC,Aw poor thing. Animals really love their siblings. Stringer has been a cuddled since the day we got him. He especially loves sleeping under my knees which is kind of weird. He's the best foot warmer ever.
beagle,35v42j,mattbin,3,Wed May 13 21:45:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Bean loved being near Scout but that never transferred to us, before or after Scout was with us. But Bean is a sweet girl and a good friend, so I'm not complaining."

One beagle curls up against my back, the other lays down on my feet and sighs. If I lay down on the couch, the girl dog insinuates herself under the blanket, though if she wants attention, she will nudge the phone or whatever out of my hand, flop over on her back, and lick my face. The boy dog will just lean up against me and lean in. He's a leaner."

beagle,35v42j,Icepop131,3,Thu May 14 05:31:49 2015 UTC,My Poppy is the perfect snuggler.  She loves it under the covers and has to lay right alongside me just in case I'm tempted to give her a little belly scratch as she drops off to sleep. If I'm late for bed she even sits in front of me and whines until I get up and follow her into the bedroom.   To be honest - I love it!!  By the way I also have a basset hound who also HAS to join us.  Good job I've got a double bed for the three of us!

beagle,34rc8r,poops_mcgee47,3,Sun May 3 22:05:19 2015 UTC,"My 10yo beagle has had seizures for the past 7-8 years. The vet diagnosed it as a form of epilepsy. I have noticed the episodes about once a month or so. He will do the same thing: shake, lie down, lose bladder control, and also his eyes will become dilated. Some last a couple minutes, and once in a while it will go 6-7 minutes. I can tell he is on the end of it when he starts responding to his name and can stand up and move about on his own.  The vet said we could give him meds which would make the time between the seizures longer, but they would be more intense when they do happen.  She said that as long as they don't get worse, then we could let it happen, just keep an eye on him, which is what we chose to do. As our pup is getting a bit older, we have noticed that for the next few hours following an episode, he is a little ""off"". He is less patient with our other animals and is less spry than his normal self.  We hate to see him go through this, but when we catch it, we just keep the other animals away from him for a while and give him treats when it's over.  I hope this helps. Sorry your pup is going through this."

beagle,34rc8r,DV_Jellyfish,3,Mon May 4 02:58:55 2015 UTC,"My 3yo Rupert had his first seizure in January this year. It happened while he was sleeping in the middle of the night and I rushed him to the emergency vet. We have been monitoring him since as they said they'd need more to occur before they could diagnose him with anything. We have been lucky, he hasn't had another, at least not one that we know about. From what I gather it is very common in beagles to have them. I'd just make sure to log when he has them and take down some details or record them if you can so you could show your vet."
beagle,34rc8r,TamponFingers,1 point,Mon May 4 04:15:22 2015 UTC,My beagle would have a seizure once a year but we were never able to pinpoint what bought them on. The vet said that since they were so rare that we didn't need any medication. She is super confused when she comes out of one but is usually better after a little bit. Here's hoping it is a rare occasion for your beagle too!
beagle,34rc8r,pheobe720,1 point,Mon May 4 04:22:11 2015 UTC,"My Beagle will have them occasionally when under stress. If the whole family is leaving together with luggage is an example. The first time he had one was about two weeks after we got him, he was about to mark a piece of furniture and I yelled ""No!""  really loud. That's all it took.  I'm assuming it's a breed specific problem... Inbreeding?"
beagle,34rc8r,TempusMn,1 point,Mon May 4 05:36:26 2015 UTC,"My buddy was having the occasional seizure, about once a year.  After the first one the vet explained that during the seizure the brain was working at full capacity trying to deal with the 'confusion' etc.  Therefore, we were advised that in future when this happened we should ensure our pup is safe, do not touch him, do not speak to him, turn lights, tv, radio off etc as these all add to the brain's 'confusion' and any external stimulus means that the dog's brain is distracted.  The last couple of times our pup has had an event like this we have followed the vets advice and found that the seizure only lasted less than a minute.  He is a little hot and tired afterwards but once he has had a drink and a sleep our pup is 'back to normal'.  Obviously because of the randomness of the events (5 in 6 years), the vet said medication was not necessary as he seems to come through them with no after effects and initial tests found no problems.  I hope your lovely lady is OK and continues to live a long, happy, safe life with her loving family."
beagle,34rc8r,Icepop131,1 point,Mon May 4 05:47:08 2015 UTC,"One thing that seems to help is making sure their blood sugar doesn't get too low, and of course what beagle is going to say no to feedings spread out around the clock and a few snacks for good measure.    The first time my current beagle had one he apparently had a round of temporary blindness to go along with it, which seemingly terrified him and he started slamming into things.  I scooted him out his door and he pinballed down the ""tunnel"" to his yard where there was so much less for him to slam into (ok, maybe the fence a couple of times) and calmed down, but it took him quite some time to fully get over it and was acting kind of distant and strange for a few days afterwards.  (And thankfully he wasn't up in the loft at the time of that first episode as he really doesn't fly all that well, his landings tend to be rather rough).  What's really odd, though, is how they seemed to happen around the time of the new moon (and actually my prior beagle seemed to react a bit funny around those times as well).  In any event, they seemed to have declined in severity to the point that if he is still having them I really can't tell the difference between that and a dogmare."
beagle,34rc8r,werevole,1 point,Mon May 4 06:08:59 2015 UTC,"I think one of the heartworm meds raises the chance of seizure. It's the first if the month, a common time to give them. Could that be the culprit?"
beagle,34rc8r,getridofwires,2,Mon May 4 10:21:38 2015 UTC,"Those once a month heartworm tablets do tend to be so much harsher than the old daily pills that often had to be broken in fourths for the correct dosage.  When I lived where that was necessary (it isn't where I live now, but that could change one of these years as things keep moving north) the beagle mix I had at the time (a labbe) would get lethargic and spaced out for days until that worked out of her system.  It wouldn't surprise me one bit if they could trigger any number of more severe reactions."

She's always had them for the seven years we've kept her but they seem more frequent lately. They last about 2 minutes and she freezes and breathes heavily, sometimes she loses bladder control too. When it happens during the day you can tell something's wrong because of her eyes. At first we thought it was allergy attacks because of the trouble breathing but we don't know what to do. Our vet offered an MRI (??!) but said there wasn't anything else to do about it. Have you had any success ?  She sleeps in my room and waking up the sound of her having seizures is terrifying. I wish I could do more than hold her and cry through it."
beagle,34rc8r,Aisren,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:40:20 2015 UTC,"I took her to the vet, and they diagnosed her with epilepsy. She's on a medication called zonisamide now, and doing great. All in all, I think it was a big ploy to be able to have a spoonful of peanut butter twice a day."

My dogs sussed it out, managed to open the door to her room, and ate all the cereal. Cue doggie poo spewed all over the house thanks to all the fiber. Naturally it was me that had to rent a carpet cleaner and shampoo the carpet for two days to clean the house up.  I have seen a lot of things. Dug corpses out of mass graves. Found a dead girl in the swamps near my house when I was a kid. The smell of ripe dog diarhea soaked into the carpet was damned near the worst thing I have ever dealt with.

If you went through a breeder I wonder if they would be willing to donate to your cause since the issue sounds like it might have been genetic? From what I've read, 6 weeks is a little early to be away from the mom."
beagle,34eki9,scottja0502,3,Thu Apr 30 14:35:58 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like it's just a case of boredom and every time you let him out it reinforces it. My beagle has started doing this a couple of times. If I know that he's not asking to go outside to pee, I call him to me then swat him on the nose and tell him to go back to bed. I go back into the other room and shut the door. After that, he may whine a bit but usually that will be the end of it because he knows that I'm not giving in. Once or twice after 5 minutes or so if he hasn't stopped I've had to do the same thing again. The worst thing you can do is give in and let him win. That guarantees that he'll be doing it again the next night. You have to out-stubborn them sometimes."
beagle,34eki9,Clayra,2,Thu Apr 30 23:12:09 2015 UTC,I call him to me then swat him on the nose   That sounds like a great way to end up with a dog that doesn't let you know when he actually has to pee either.

I'm going to start making him go back in the crate and shut the door when he behaves like that.  His crate is not a ""safe"" place for him so I don't feel bad using it as a punishment.  Thanks for your insight!  EDIT: sorry as for swatting him on the nose....I normally would and do with my other dogs but we are pretty sure he was beaten and does not respond to that...  He is really is the most lovable dog if he would just sleep through the night!"

beagle,34eki9,goos_momma,1 point,Fri May 1 13:29:15 2015 UTC,"Ok. I just asked to ensure it wasn't a UTI or other medical issue that you should talk to your vet about. Seeing as it is not, it's likely stemming from boredom and seeking attention. The best way to resolve it is to pick up a pair of earplugs and totally ignore it. Because he's looking for attention and engagement, whether he receives positive attention (by letting him outside) or negative attention (sending him to his crate), you are still giving into exactly what he wants and acknowledging his behavior. He can only whine for so long before getting tired and settling down, and as soon as he realizes that it doesn't get him anywhere, the behavior will extinguish itself overtime. Patience is key.  Good luck!"

No matter how reliable his recall is at home, all of that goes out the window in a new, stimulating environment; so I'd have him supervised on a fifty foot long line (carabiner clipped to my belt) for safety. Consider this more of an opportunity to practice his recall so that you may be able to trust him in the future, than it is to let him run wild."

beagle,344w9u,Kimyas,5,Tue Apr 28 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"Then personally, I wouldn't let him off leash. I'm not suggesting there's a correlation, but I've seen just as many 'Should I let my Beagle off leash?' questions as I have lost Beagle posts. If you were confident enough in his reliability to have him off leash, then you wouldn't have to ask. But there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, just pick up a long line and let him explore to his heart's desire."
beagle,344w9u,molsonbeagle,2,Tue Apr 28 16:44:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. OP should know his dog well enough if he can be trusted. I know mine will always come looking for me, even if it is in his own damn time.   If you want to try, bring a bag full of the best treats you can find and make sure your dog knows you got them for him. Take something that has a strong smell, like (young) cheese,  or little bacon cubes.  Then keep on calling him back often. If you feel like it's not working, put him on a leash."

beagle,344w9u,molsonbeagle,3,Wed Apr 29 00:10:18 2015 UTC,"That's just a GPS tracker. There are plenty available on the market, neither of which guarantee his safety. If you don't mind my asking, why are you so adamant on having your dog off leash? You have a curious, independent scenthound bred to shut out everything but his nose; if you wanted a dog that would stay close you should have gotten a Border Collie. A GPS tracker is great to have, but it doesn't provide nearly the same security as having him literally attached to your hip by a long line. Since the fields are kept short, he shouldn't even notice the difference. As I mentioned before, unless he happens to have a recall so reliable that if anything were to happen you can call him off of it (which most Beagles don't have), then I don't think it's worth putting his life at risk just so he can 'let live'."

Ideally I'd be feeding raw, but it doesn't work with my lifestyle at the moment, so I feed Acana since I get a discount for it at the pet store. She's also just naturally built pretty slim since she's taller than most beagles.   Edit: Jayne also gets 1/2 cup for breakfast and dinner along with 1/3 of a cup for lunch. She also gets tons of treats, which is why I don't feed her all that much. (Also the food she's is high protein so she needs less of it)"

beagle,33y7dj,Adler221,2,Thu Apr 30 15:41:26 2015 UTC,You've got one very pretty Beagle :)
beagle,33y7dj,PantyPixie,2,Sun Apr 26 22:34:51 2015 UTC,Jayne is beautiful! I can't wait to take Flynn on the trails!
beagle,33wywf,PantyPixie,3,Sun Apr 26 12:51:10 2015 UTC,oh man :( So sorry. Can you tell us about him?
beagle,33wywf,RobieWan,4,Sun Apr 26 16:32:23 2015 UTC,"He is the single most gentlest sweetest guy that has ever inhabited this great blue marble.  A tri-colored love-bug of a Beags that dispenses unconditional love at a rate that would warm your heart and blow your mind at the same time.  He knows when you're sad and shares your pain. He does not discriminate and loves everyone and everything all the same.  I am 31 and he is approximately 10-12 yrs old and has been in my life for the past 8 years and despite the 23 yrs I existed prior to meeting him...I can not picture my life without him in it.  I feel completely broken at the thought of losing him.  If only I could be the person my Beagle sees me as...  I sat beside him the other day and tearfully told him it is okay if he needs to go, I will miss him dearly, but if he decides to stay I will try my best to make him feel as comfortable as possible. And that I am sorry for anything and everything I ever did that made him sad.  Love...Its some serious shit. :*("
beagle,33wywf,RobieWan,3,Sun Apr 26 19:40:53 2015 UTC,Oh man the feels.. I'm so sorry :(  I've got 3 and I can't imagine my life without them.   If only humanity could be more like our beagles. It's obvious he is very loved and had a great live once you came into the picture.  Edit: thanks for sharing
beagle,33wywf,aftersilence,3,Sun Apr 26 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind sentiments. We found him September 2007 on a major interstate between the slow lane & the fast lane. We first thought he was dumped there, but the grass stains and the fact that he was loaded with ticks suggested he probably ran off or was on a hunt and got lost. We named him ""Miles"" as we felt the name was appropriate.   ""Miles of Smiles"" is his motto. He is the best.   King of the Beasts I'd say."
beagle,33wywf,aftersilence,3,Sun Apr 26 21:16:09 2015 UTC,"I've never felt heartbreak over a relationship ending like the heartbreak I felt when my Beag left the world. I really think having dogs like these in the world makes us better people, and I'm sure you're exactly the person your buddy sees you as.   It'll be okay. It's going to hurt like crazy and it will feel like it's never going to be okay, and to an extent that's true. You'll never totally get over losing him. My girl left a little over a year ago and I'm tearing up writing this now, thinking about her. But eventually, it's okay. And eventually, you even feel strong enough to get another dog. Who will never be the same, because your dog was one in a million, but every now and again your new dog will do something so out of character, that it's like your old buddy is whispering in their ear 'hey, lemme tell you how things work around here'. And you smile, and you know that the circle goes on.   You sound like you've had amazing memories together, you're so lucky he chose your family."
beagle,33wywf,WonderfulJustWonderf,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:46:22 2015 UTC,"Your message was so incredibly touching. I kind of lost my composure a bit reading it. :*(    'hey, lemme tell you how things work around here'.   Yeah...that was it for me.  Thank you so much for the love and support and for sharing your story with me. I'm looking at him right now, resting, wondering what he would rather chose. To stay and keep fighting or move on from this world.  I just want to make it right for him. <3"

beagle,33tm11,helegad,3,Sat Apr 25 15:01:21 2015 UTC,I saw an all white beagle at the dog park. She was 11 years old. The owners showed me a photo of her at 4 years old and she was tri-coloured with very deep black and tan. They said she started fading at about 7 years old. It was quite amazing!

Do they ever grow out of this destructive chewing?"
beagle,33khtq,bewareofduck,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"I think they are when they're bored. Frodo was very destructive as a puppy (and I mean, doors, cupboards, we went through 3 tennis ball packs a week as he chews them up when we're not looking, as well as those black Kong toys, pillows, his bed or anything with stuffing, my dad's montblanc pen, etc) but this gradually reduced - everytime he bites something we have a ""detention corner"" system but sometimes he bites, and goes in there himself before we find out about it. By 2 years old he only bit dolls and we got him a bigger ball that he can't chew through. And now he's 3, and all our stuff is intact. For now at least  : p also as reinforcement ""treats"" we use ice cubes - he loves them and he's also on a diet."

beagle,33axct,badbluemoon,2,Tue Apr 21 02:33:10 2015 UTC,"we got him after he was dumped on the side of the road. He was 9 weeks old or so.  LOADED with worms. Skinny but bloated. Vet said it was horrible. He is 10 weeks old now, but even after medicine and more food this week than he's probably ever had in his life, he's still so tiny. He's got big paws and ears too big for his tiny head, but I just can't quite place his breed.  He's def part lab, but he's got a lot of black and white speckles on his chest, where the typical white patch is on a black lab. He howls and yelps like a beagle though, and when he sees a bird in our yard he's got the beagle pose (one leg curled, tail stiff) down.  I'm thinking that's what he is.  He's a sweetheart though. We named him Linus (our other rescue is a 3 year old pure chocolate lab named Charlie Brown)  edit: another picture  http://i.imgur.com/ViBjxR8.jpg"

beagle,32zgup,Andrea6661,5,Sat Apr 18 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"We had to put up a fence around our garden. No not to keep the deer out, but to keep our beagle out. We have a whole bunch of asparagus plants. He would just his whole mouth over the top of them, and bite them off at the base!  The green beans still grew near enough to the fence, that he would mash his face against the mesh and bite some off with his teeth. Then he'd run away with them because he knew he wasn't supposed to be stealing them.  I love that little bastard."

I would only allow her to have a bone outside, never bringing it inside. Once she stops chewing on it, you pick it up and throw it out. Choose just one day a week that she's allowed to have a bone, when you're at home and can supervise her. Once you have a child, your Beagle is then only allowed to have a bone when you can keep her and your child completely seperated, until you get rid of the bone. Otherwise you don't give her bones at all, and just stick with normal feeding."

Sometimes they do take off further than we would like, but after being off-leash for a while a kind of understanding is established. They leave but always come back to check on us frequently. Sometimes we do have to track them down and it can be a hassle, but we feel it's better than us taking them out in nature and chaining them to one spot.   It really helps to keep moving, like on a hiking trail or something. They know what the trail is and will stay on it or near it, even if they run ahead out of sight."

beagle,32nwly,_yesitis,2,Wed Apr 15 12:57:17 2015 UTC,"You'll have to figure out what she is drawn to. Here are somethings my beagle enjoys:   Kong I actually upgraded to the black one which is supposed to be stronger. The first year I had Flynn I think I had bought two or three red ones because eventually they'd be too torn up. He's had the black one almost 6 months, and I can't really see any signs of wear. Chew Stick I think I actually got the medium one. He doesn't chew it all the time, but when Flynn is like, ""I NEED TO CHEW SOMETHING,"" he goes to town on it. Ropes Flynn has four of these. I actually got them at Target for a $1. I got him one the day I adopted him (two years ago), and we still play with it. It doesn't look as nice and the ends have had to be tied multiple times, but it has lasted. Ropes are his favorite toys. Chuckle This one is great. I actually put his dinner in it sometimes because it makes him eat slower. He loves it! It is also enriching for dogs because they have to figure out how to get the food out.   Also, keep in mind beagles tend to have very strong jaws. Don't get upset if yours tears up a toy almost instantly. Flynn has destroyed a toy in less than 5 minutes. From my experience, usually the cheaper the toy the more durable it is. Not always the case, but something I've noticed. Oh, and practice your sewing skills. You may end up mending stuffed toys fairly often.  Edit: some formatting"

beagle,32gq7i,_yesitis,2,Mon Apr 13 18:29:48 2015 UTC,"We play tug-of-war and I throw his animals and such around when I'm home. We snuggle a lot on the couch, and he has bones to gnaw on (I just bought him some new ones). We go on walks, during which he likes to linger to sniff everything... But it's all clearly not enough time at each.  Any ideas or suggestions for toys/activities that can keep him stimulated when I can't engage with him 1:1 (ex: while I cook dinner/read/do chores)?"
beagle,32gq7i,_yesitis,2,Mon Apr 13 18:38:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely! My Beagle has a fly snapping OCD, so she needs roughly 1.5 - 2 hours of exercise daily to keep it at bay. I know her situation isn't the norm, but nevertheless, I think 1 hour of structured exercise daily is a reasonable goal to shoot for to ensure he's tired enough that he'd rather chill out than whine, even if it means waking up an hour early to fit in the time. Aside from that, the breed is notorious for being very food motivated, so I prefer to capitalize on her daily amount of food rather than have her inhale it from a bowl in under a minute. We only train for 15 minutes a day, but she loves to work for every piece, and the additional mental exercise can be just as exhausting as the physical. At the end of the day, I moisten whatever's left (serve the kibble into a cup with water, and let it sit for an hour while you go about your business), stuff it into a Kong or two, and freeze them overnight for the next day. It's both mentally stimulating and just an easy way to keep her occupied while I'm running errands/doing chores without overfeeding.  This article from the ASPCA has a ton of suggestions as well.   Good luck!"

beagle,329hx2,gary_lasereyes_,8,Sun Apr 12 13:33:10 2015 UTC,She's so cute!  And she has a dew claw on her back foot like our beagle did.  We had to remove it though because it was very hard to trim.  Kinda made me sad because it made her unique.
beagle,329hx2,skieryne,2,Sun Apr 12 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! I love her to pieces. She is being super stubborn with house training though. It seems that even though she knows she will get a treat when going out to potty, she will still goes in the house just out of spite. Lol"
beagle,329hx2,skieryne,2,Sun Apr 12 12:16:31 2015 UTC,It takes time. Just have patience. Our little girl still went in the house until she was about 6 months old. It just clicked with her one day. Just keep doing what you're doing. Does she have separation anxiety?
beagle,329hx2,zdaytonaroadster,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:24:09 2015 UTC,"It's hasn't been horrible. My SO and I work during the day so she is alone for about 8 hours. We let her free roam in the kitchen while we are at work, and she handles it pretty well. At night she sleeps in her kennel with no problem. Once she gets older and can hold it all day we will transition her to the kennel full time."

beagle,329hx2,skieryne,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:23:52 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase. I work during the day, my SO works in retail and mainly closes. So at the most, she is by herself for about 8 hours. Happens about once a week."

beagle,329hx2,blue5panda,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:59:31 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you guys have had success with the kennel. Luna hates it. We trust her enough now to let her free roam while we're at work. She also sleeps with us. Her separation anxiety isn't too bad now. She's not destructive, just makes a ton of noise when we get home after work. Other than that she's pretty good."
beagle,329hx2,zdaytonaroadster,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:13:26 2015 UTC,"What really helped us is we never shoved her in there. When we first got penny, she would fall asleep in our bed and we would put her in there. It was never forced. Now when she is tired she will just go plop down in her kennel for a nap.   Our  biggest challenge right now is the house training. Penny piddles a lot, and we aren't sure why. She has been treated for a UTI but she will piddle just a tiny bit randomly. She even does it right after we bring her in from going to the bathroom. Hopefully she grows out of it. This is my first dog, so I guess this could be normal. I'm just learning as I go at this point. Lol"

beagle,31t22e,moshnaked,11,Tue Apr 7 23:05:23 2015 UTC,"Those pads really develop bad habits of going inside.   Start by taking her out every hour or two, say let's go potty. If she doesn't potty within a few minutes go back inside.   If she goes inside between outings, right after, say let's go potty and take her out for a few minutes.  When you take her on a walk say ""time for a walk"" and then proceed with a walk."

beagle,31t22e,turtlehana,3,Wed Apr 8 01:09:47 2015 UTC,Just take them away. She may have an accident a few times but if you're on top of taking her out enough that she understands you'll be fine.

beagle,31t22e,jeter08,3,Thu Apr 9 20:39:19 2015 UTC,Take one of the soiled pads outside and get her used to going outside that way.
beagle,31t22e,SpacedCadette,3,Wed Apr 8 01:30:27 2015 UTC,"We actually had to teach our dog twice, he recently had a ruptured disc and literally was paralyzed waist down and re-learn how to walk, pee, and poop. We took him out every couple hours, even took him to front yard where he hardly goes just to stimulate him marking his territory and say good boy each time he peed and gave him a treat. He eventually got to the point where he would pee, then just look for a treat, so that indicated that he forced it vs him needing to go."
beagle,31t22e,brandwun,2,Wed Apr 8 06:27:08 2015 UTC,Just be persistent and take her out frequently. If she doesn't go outside then keep her on a leash and keep an eye on her inside. Do what you can to prevent her from getting the chance to urinate or defecate indoors. Honestly it's all about perserverance.
beagle,31t22e,turtlehana,2,Tue Apr 7 23:12:01 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your new roommate! I just adopted another Beagle last week as well. What I learned from my first dog is that consistency helps a ton. As mentioned in other comments, create a signal for walking and a signal for when she goes potty- reward with treats. Also, try to keep your timings for walks and potties the same as well. First thing in the morning has worked well for me."

During the day Milo goes out every 3-4 hours, he will go to the door around the usual time, if we take him out earlier he still goes to the door at the usual time... He will literally throw his leash at us. (He is almost 5)."
beagle,31t22e,4x4prints,2,Wed Apr 8 01:28:27 2015 UTC,"We rescued a middle-aged beagle who had been inside a house pretty much his whole life, so he wasn't used to doing his business outside. For the first couple weeks, we took him on a crazy number of walks every day, like 8 - 10 maybe (but we were lucky to be able to do that, schedule-wise). That helped a lot - he still peed in the house occasionally, but he got into the habit of thinking of it as an outside thing. The longer you can go without her going in the house, the more she'll get used to thinking of outside as the place to do it. Definitely get rid of the pads. Give her lots of positive encouragement whenever she pees or poops outside, and don't freak out at her when she goes in the house (because if she doesn't get that inside is not the place to do it, she'll think that it's just the going itself that's bad, which can be confusing), but stop her immediately if you catch her at it and take her outside. You can do it - like some other people have said here, perseverance is the thing."
beagle,31t22e,_yesitis,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:34:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for the long response :)   I'm going to take all the necessary steps to do so and I will persevere  :P
beagle,31t22e,_yesitis,2,Wed Apr 8 02:37:05 2015 UTC,"Somebody else mentioned taking a soiled pee pad out to where you want  she to go. This really does help! She'll smell it and associate it with going pee. Make sure you clean up all accidents with Natures Miracle enzymatic cleaner; regular cleaners won't work at all and some could make it worse. You don't want the smell of urine linger anywhere in the house. Extra hard because you just happen to have the most successful smeller ever! Be persistent and patient. Don't get mad for accidents, but reward right behavior. If she's not shy, throw parties when she pees outside. Be SUPER happy to the point of being goofy. Dance, prance, praise- treat.   Leashes. Please not retractable. They scare the hell out of me. Harnesses that attach at the front are good for training loose leash walking. Regular collar/leash is fine once she's trained more. Use her love of sniffing as a reward. For example, if she walks nice for a certain amount of time, she gets praised and rewarded by having some time to sniff and do her her thing- then go back to walking nicely.   Remember beagles are fairly unreliable off leash. I have a few places I can take mine off leash now, but for regular parks that have traffic even remotely nearby, I have a 50 foot training leash to let drag behind him (you have to be super watchful and never do this with a regular collar) but it helps as it gives you some time in case she bolts. My dog has a great recall 90% of the time- even when on the general scent of something or off being mischievous, but if he's after a squirrel/deer/rabbit/bird..forget it. He'd come back, but I'm not going to risk him getting hit by a car. The 50' lead is also a great training tool for recall. Loads of videos out there on positive reinforcement training too.   Be patient. Beagles are really super smart but they're their own dog. As much as they're very very attached to their humans, they don't live to please you in the same way some other dogs do. I think my dog is the only dog in the world that simply never greets me at the door. He stubbornly stays where he was at and gives me sideway glances. If I still don't pay attention his tail starts wildly going and he jumps up to say hello and yells in excitement- but he'd never be caught dead actually ""lowering himself"" to greeting dog standards.   They're hilarious and full of personality! Congrats and hope you're very happy together!"

beagle,31rq4v,NicoSuave11,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:02:57 2015 UTC,Sorry that this wasn't more helpful
beagle,31rq4v,NicoSuave11,3,Fri Apr 24 09:13:03 2015 UTC,"If you usually have the TV or some background noise in the house while you're at home, I'd suggest leaving that on when you leave as well. Is your beagle destructive to your furniture? If not I would suggest letting him out of his crate to walk around the house and feel more at home. Beagles should be treated somewhat like little children, move food to the back of the counters so they can't get a hold of it, make sure they can't knock over plants or other items off of shelves which could potentially hurt them, etc. An 8 month beagle is still pretty young so I would understand why he has severe separation anxiety at the moment. Once they get a bit older, they will simmer down quite a lot."
beagle,31rq4v,FireIce11X,3,Tue Apr 7 19:48:40 2015 UTC,Mine will do what I call 'vengeance poops' when I don't at least leave a radio on for him.  Usually don't hear complaints if the radio is on from the neighbors.
beagle,31rq4v,pooticlesparkle,4,Tue Apr 7 23:02:13 2015 UTC,"I give my beagle his Kong with a Denta-stik shoved inside. This helps redirect his attention. Also, when I first got him my boyfriend and I each gave him a piece of clothing we didn't wear anymore (old t-shirt and hoodie). Having something with our scents seemed to help quite a bit. He could curl up on his bed with them. I would also leave a toy or two with him, usually one of his favorite ropes and a squeaky toy.  If you can get your puppy to focus his attention on something else that would help a lot. Also, try putting him in his gate even while you are home. You have to teach him that it isn't a bad place. In fact it should be one the places he feels the safest. Also, don't make a big production of leaving him or letting him out when you get home. I say, ""Bye, Flynn,"" when I give him is Kong and then I am out the door. When I come home I greet him, but nothing over the top. Treat it as natural as possible, and eventually it'll be normal for him."
beagle,31rq4v,ShelinStL,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:44:40 2015 UTC,With any toy we give him he just stares at it for a second then stares right back at us.  I will try a shirt though.  We've tried ignoring him when we're leaving besides putting him in his gate and then don't really pay attention to him when we get back until he calms down.
beagle,31rq4v,ShelinStL,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:30:18 2015 UTC,"Ignoring was always hard for me in the beginning, but if you give in to his cries then he'll know what your breaking point is. That is true for any training. You want to be the pack leader so don't back down because if you give in and give in then he'll think he's the dominant one.   It'll get better. Consistency is key. You need to be consistent with your actions and whoever you live with needs to be consistent with those same actions."
beagle,31rq4v,thePudgyOutcast,3,Wed Apr 8 13:19:49 2015 UTC,"I have a 9 month old beagle/jack russell mix. My SO and I got him at 6 weeks so have been dealing with separation anxiety from day one! It's really hard, and as someone else said, is not going to change over night. Any time we left him alone he would howl and howl, and occasionally got destructive. Now he howls sometimes, but it won't last more than 10-15 mins on his worst days. My only advice is to practice going in and out of the apartment a lot whenever you are home. Start small. Just walk out the door, turn around, come back in. Then work up to 1 minute, then 5 minutes, etc. The hope is he will eventually get used to you leaving without him. Every dog is different of course, but its worth a shot. :) Also, if I know I have to leave him alone for a long time, say 5 hours, and I can't get him to doggy day care, I try to plan to tire him out first. Take him to the dog park, or on a long walk so that when I leave he's so tired he doesn't care :)"
beagle,31rq4v,swedishberry,2,Tue Apr 7 23:34:57 2015 UTC,"This is my suggestion as well since my beagle had terrible anxiety. Planned departures - you literally spend hours going back and forth, in and out, slowly increasing the time. It takes a little while but if you're consistent, you'll get there.   Establish good routines. While doing planned departures, determine how you want your leaving routine to work. Does he get a treat? Have music on? Do you say a specific word? Use them every time while you practice.   If these dont help at all, hire a trainer who knows this problem intimately. Its the best money I've ever spent for my dog."
beagle,31rq4v,xXTurtlePowerXx,3,Tue Apr 7 23:55:59 2015 UTC,"This sounds exactly like my dog. We have actually gotten complaints from our building manager regarding the howling. So we sent him to doggie daycare, but it got to a point where his daycare was just too expensive ($500/month, which included a taxi service). Since then, we've left him to his own devices at home when we leave. We give him a jerky treat before we leave, and it keeps him occupied for 5-10 minutes while we're gone. He then howls/finds destructive things to do (RIP $2k couch). All in all, I'd say doggie daycare vs a dog walker is even, but with the power of 20/20 hindsight, I would have kept him at daycare.  I know this isn't a ton of help, but my wife and I have 5 years of Beagle experience, and are more than happy to answer questions."
beagle,31rq4v,_yesitis,3,Tue Apr 7 17:49:09 2015 UTC,"Separation anxiety is not something that you can expect to resolve overnight, so it's no surprise that a Kong with peanut butter, a dose of Zylkene, or any other 'quick fix' had little to no effect. The ASPCA has a fantastic outlined treatment plan for dogs whose separation anxiety ranges anywhere from mild to severe. The only thing I'd add is to never forget to appreciate every ounce of progress you make, and not to give up or become inconsistent with your training if you aren't seeing instant results- keep at it.   Good luck!"
beagle,31rq4v,Kimbobrains,3,Tue Apr 7 23:13:36 2015 UTC,My beagle did the same thing when I tried to leave him in one of those large pens in my apartment.  I ended up putting him in my bedroom with his water and potty pad but he would still howl and be very anxious when I got home.  I decided to let him roam the whole apartment during the day.  I made sure to take him out before I left and right when I got home.  I also spoke with the apartment manager and let him know I am working on training him to stay quiet during the day and to call me if he doesn't stop barking.  I bought a home surveillance camera to see if he calmed down at any point during the day.   I stuff a kong with lamb jerky from costco and throw it for him as I leave which keeps him distracted for a few minutes.  It turns out for him at least that he wanted to have the whole place to roam around.  He would bark frantically for a few minutes after he's done with the kong but then he would stop.  I try not to go back inside for any reason if he is barking so he knows that behavior doesn't make me come back.  He is 4 years old now and still has separation issues but it's manageable.  I've also recently moved into a very pet friendly apartment complex which helps because the majority of the residents have pets and understand that they bark and get lonely sometimes.  Hope this helps.
beagle,31rq4v,blue5panda,2,Wed Apr 8 14:45:44 2015 UTC,Get another dog so he's not alone. It works wonders.
beagle,31rq4v,zmartini,2,Wed Apr 8 05:51:37 2015 UTC,"Careful, though - 2 dogs csn be three times as much work"
beagle,31rq4v,blue5panda,1 point,Wed Apr 8 10:05:36 2015 UTC,"While they're being trained, yeah. But once they're trained, it's an absolute joy."
beagle,31rq4v,mortalbic,2,Thu Apr 9 00:52:02 2015 UTC,"I would suggest giving him an old shirt or some piece of clothing of yours. It will provide him your scent while you're gone.  Also, I'm having a difficult time picturing how much space he has with the gate. We've always used a crate for our beagle. Once she was deemed trustworthy, we tried to just leave her out in the house while we were gone. She was okay with it for a week or so. One day, my SO and I came home from work, and she had a meltdown! We started putting her back in the crate, and she seemed perfectly content. We think she likes the confined crate space. Maybe your boy has too much space? A more confined space may make him feel more secure."
beagle,31rq4v,mortalbic,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:41:48 2015 UTC,Oh we had a crate for him at the beginning but he definitely doesn't like that.  The gate right now is this one  He hasn't been sleeping in the crate in my parents house but since we just moved out this weekend we've put him back in there.  He wakes up and whines through the night because of this.  At night we're just worried about him destroying the apartment or peeing/pooping on the carpet if he isn't in the crate and we're not watching him..
beagle,31rq4v,wrath_of_dionysus,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:34:25 2015 UTC,"Our beagle slept in the crate too until just recently. I definitely understand that fear of waking up to pee, poop, plush, etc.  Take into consideration that your recent move is stressful. New environment, new fears. If I was in your position, I would take him on a really long walk before bed. When you put him in the gate, cover the entire thing in blanket(s). Make it pitch black. It completely helped us learn to sleep again."
beagle,31rq4v,Shattering_Moxen,2,Wed Apr 8 00:13:38 2015 UTC,"Our guy howled when we would leave for the first few weeks that we had him, but he seems to have stopped (at least according to the neighbors). We keep him in a crate when we're gone, and we spent quite a while building up to leaving him alone for longer periods. At first, we'd have him in there for just a little while, but while we were home. If he whined, we would reassure him but not let him out until he calmed down a bit, so that he would learn that it was easier to chill out in there, and that he wouldn't be stranded forever. Then we'd actually leave for larger and larger increments of time. Now he loves his crate - he hangs out in there of his own accord, it's like his little den. Seems like beagles are notoriously difficult with separation anxiety - I hope you find something that works!"
beagle,31rq4v,willsmithstaint,2,Wed Apr 8 02:45:31 2015 UTC,We had the same issue with our beagle and we resorted to a spraying bark collar with citronella for when we leave the apartment. It seemed to work in conjunction with spraying him in the face with a squirt gun when he howled at night in his crate.
beagle,31rq4v,UntimelyOccurrence,2,Thu Apr 9 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"First of all I want to say that every situation is different - every home, family, and dog is all different and what works for some may not work for others. Also my beagle does not howl - he cries. He cries hysterically. It sounds like he's being murdered whenever we leave the house. It's pitiful, heartbreaking, and ear-splitting.   My beagle pup is about the same age. We crate-trained him from the beginning and he loves going into it and taking naps. He goes to bed when we tell him to and keeps his toys there. We have tried all of the following:   Leaving and coming back at random times throughout the day. Not saying goodbye to him (not giving him any attention for about 20 minutes before we leave). Putting jackets on, picking up keys and purses and then just sitting on the couch.  Getting a kong, stuffing it with peanut butter, putting a sweet potato chew inside the peanut butter, freezing it all for hours beforehand Hiding treats in puzzle-type toys.  Tiring him out beforehand by going on a really long walk/jog. Leaving the TV on, leaving the radio on.  Keeping the room dark, keeping the room lit. Covering his crate with a big blanket, taking it off. Using an ADAPTIL plug-in.   After trying all of these things for various periods over the course of about three months and actually achieving relative success (we would wait outside our apartment door for 10-15 minutes to make sure he was quiet before leaving), we still received two visits from the police/animal control while being gone for less than two hours. They did not fine us, for which I am grateful, but it really put us in a position where we no longer feel comfortable working to help our beagle's separation anxiety. We cannot leave him alone in the house while living in an apartment. I signed him up for doggy daycare and we got him very VERY used to behaving in the car. Now he comes with us everywhere - even grocery shopping or out for a quick meal - and will sit patiently in the car until we come back out. It seems that as long as he can see the building we go in, he is fine.  It is not ideal obviously, but I feel like other than putting him on medication (which may or may not work) or getting a second dog (which we simply cannot do), it is our only option until we have our own home and plenty of room between neighbors.   Once we are in a better situation we will be returning to the separation anxiety conditioning. I think the things that worked best for us were all the activities we did to make us leaving seem normal, the kong+PB, and tiring him out."
beagle,31rq4v,turtlehana,2,Thu Apr 9 18:50:41 2015 UTC,"We struggled with this for a while with my 6-mo old Beagle puppy, and still do to some extent. Here's what helped us.    We keep him crated at night in our bed room. Bed time is 10 pm, and we put him in and shut the bedroom door. For a while, we were pulling his crate to the living room during the day so he could see us. This made it worse when we left.    Instead, we keep the crate in the bedroom, and put him in the crate as though it's bed time when we leave in the morning. So a typical morning, we wake up, take a short walk, feed him breakfast, and let him play around for a while. When we get close to leaving--15-30 minutes--we sit with him on the couch and he usually starts getting sleepy again. Then, we move him to the crate in the bedroom, and leave like normal. It tricks him into thinking it's just nap time rather than he is abandoned. He did realize that we left at some point, and would be barking when we got back, but this subsided after 1-2 weeks.    After a few weeks of this, we moved the crate back to the living room, and put him in the crate when we get ready to leave. Now, he occasionally whines when he realizes we are leaving, but he is fine until we get back."
beagle,31rq4v,Iceman852,2,Thu Apr 9 19:49:21 2015 UTC,"I hope someone has good advice. We couldn't crate train because we are in an apartment, anxiety pills, calming scents, Centralia collars, and shock collars didn't help and he kept howling or whinning. So he goes to daycamp if we leave or comes with us."
beagle,31rq4v,turtlehana,2,Tue Apr 7 17:30:41 2015 UTC,"I don't exactly have a beagle, I have a pit bull mix but she had such bad anxiety when we first got her up until we started taking her to day care. Now she is perfectly happy if we leave her and even loves going to daycare(day camp etc). Its an amazing thing for socializing dogs."
beagle,31rq4v,leavealone,2,Tue Apr 7 21:54:52 2015 UTC,He is fine if we leave him at day camp or with people but we can't leave him at home alone for any amount of time :/
beagle,31rq4v,_yesitis,2,Tue Apr 7 22:43:52 2015 UTC,"My 8 year old beagle still freaks out every time we leave. She used to get upset when even one of us left so the person staying home spent time distracting her by playing until she forgot. That worked enough that she no longer flips out when I leave for work (she's particularity attached to me.) If she's left all alone she howls, so we had to resort to a bark collar to avoid getting kicked out of the building. It has adjustable settings for training purposes. She stays in one room behind a gate with food, water, and bed, and the cats can visit her. We're still working on it...But at least she knows not to bark with the collar on."
beagle,31rq4v,leavealone,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:18:35 2015 UTC,We tried the bark collar and kept it on the setting where it gets more intense if he keeps barking.  It got to the highest level and he freaked out.  We had to run and cut it off of him.
