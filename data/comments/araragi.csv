araragi,3dyk2s,AnatoleSerial,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:36 2015 UTC,I have seen Tsuki before Hana because of timeline.
araragi,3dyk2s,Jammintk,9,Mon Jul 20 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"You fucked up. The series isn't meant to be seen chronologically. It's supposed to be seen in release order. Shaft knows what they are doing and it makes the most sense if watched in release order.  That said, you should probably start from the beginning on the novels, since Kizumonogatari hasn't been adapted into an anime yet and it is going to be the first officially translated novel, coming out later this year."
araragi,3dyk2s,HayabusaZeroZ,3,Mon Jul 20 21:10:49 2015 UTC,"I'm confused why Hana is recommended to not watch last though. I already did watch the series in release order, but Hana still confused me when I went on to Tsuki.  I'm used to mixed up chronology, but that one was the one I didn't really understand.  Please actually explain it instead of downvoting me, people..."

araragi,3dyk2s,are_you_a_walrus,8,Tue Jul 21 02:48:39 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Hana is the last part in the timeline. Other ~monogatari stories exist between kizu and hana
araragi,3dyk2s,are_you_a_walrus,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"Wait, Hana is the last novel? Or the latest timeline of the anime?"
araragi,3dyk2s,AnatoleSerial,5,Mon Jul 20 17:19:33 2015 UTC,Yeah Hana is the end. Check this picture out http://i.imgur.com/4jRGYIP.jpg at the bottom it says Hana is last
araragi,3dyk2s,are_you_a_walrus,3,Mon Jul 20 17:58:48 2015 UTC,Hana is the last one ;_;
araragi,3dyk2s,Landanbananaman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:11 2015 UTC,Yeah but despite that owari and kizu expands on the relationships between the characters which is still really good despite no more expansion of the timeline. I'm especially waiting for owari so I can see more hitagixkoyomi interaction

araragi,3dmst6,ClouSIN,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:39:31 2015 UTC,I heard something about it possibly being licensed by yen press. Might have been a rumour
araragi,3dmst6,Landanbananaman,4,Fri Jul 17 16:55:55 2015 UTC,"Vertical, not Yen.  Kizu comes out in November.  http://www.amazon.com/KizuMonogatari-Nishio-Ishin/dp/1941220975  BUY IT, and tell your friends to buy it. Or buy it for your friends! If Kizu is successful, the chances of getting all the novels published does increase. Who knows? If it's successful enough maybe we'll also get Katanagatari, Forgetful Detective, or the rest of the Zaregoto series!"
araragi,3dmst6,AnatoleSerial,2,Fri Jul 17 17:26:55 2015 UTC,Thanks sir! I found my next pre-order :D It's probably the only way I will be able to get my hands on Kizu before it's released in an animated form is ten years or so.
araragi,3dmst6,jokiratv,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:53:54 2015 UTC,"Aye, it is!!"
araragi,3dmst6,AnatoleSerial,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:56:39 2015 UTC,Buying it after work.  Is this the only one translated?
araragi,3dmst6,Landanbananaman,2,Fri Jul 17 18:01:34 2015 UTC,Yes
araragi,3dmst6,Jammintk,2,Fri Jul 17 18:05:52 2015 UTC,"So far, yes. When it was announced, the Vertical reps mentioned that it was mostly because the Monogatari Series was heavily requested. They went for Kizu first because it is the beginning of the story. If Kizu sells well, the rest of the novels should happen."
araragi,3dmst6,AnatoleSerial,2,Fri Jul 17 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"As an aside, a while ago, when officially English-translated Monogatari was but a dream, Vertical mentioned approximately the sales that they would need for two volumes of Bake here. According to this 3000-4000 would be the minimum of what they'd be looking at for Kizu to make its money back. I'd imagine that Kizu would actually have to sell a lot better than that for them to consider licensing more but I really hope it happens.   Also, I remember Vertical saying that it's a title/series that they wanted for a while, since they have in-office fans, but couldn't justify the expense. I'm really hoping it sells well and we can get all of them!"
araragi,3dmst6,supicasupica,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:07:43 2015 UTC,"No, you shouldn't hope it sells well: you should do your job, my friend, as a fan! Promote the Book! Make sure people know it exists and it's awesome. In fact, read it in public spaces, like buses, parks or schools. Someone will want to know what you're reading, and maybe they'll become interested and buy it too."
araragi,3dmst6,AnatoleSerial,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:47:52 2015 UTC,So I should buy two copies
araragi,3dmst6,Landanbananaman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:58:37 2015 UTC,"Two for you, two for your mom, two for you dad.  And the some more to give away to people."
araragi,3dmst6,AnatoleSerial,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"Up to you. I am pretty sure that Vertical has bragged MULTIPLE times about never dropping a series once they start publishing. But with that said, light novels are MUCH more labor intensive to translate than manga. And with the way the Monogatari series is, it may be divided up into different license restrictions, meaning that they may have to license the second season, and they aren't going to licence it if they think it won't make any money."
araragi,3dmst6,JubJub87,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:23:24 2015 UTC,"It's the only one officially translated. Also, it's not actually finished yet.  Don't get your hopes up for fan translations, you'll rarely find anything other than an abandoned attempt."
araragi,3dlr9c,ItsEdvard,2,Fri Jul 17 08:16:53 2015 UTC,"Not AFAIK.  Though Kizumonogatari is getting an official release this November, so make sure to get it, and also convince everyone you know tk buy it!"

araragi,3dc9gw,AnatoleSerial,3,Wed Jul 15 04:21:49 2015 UTC,"She gets some of the funniest lines / moments of the series, no doubt."
araragi,3dc9gw,Ars_Y,7,Fri Jul 17 08:32:22 2015 UTC,"Always love the fact that no matter how out-of-order the series seems to be, they (Shaft and Nisio Isin) always always always give some kind of time frame in the beginning of each arc.  That being said, the way Nisio Isin ties in Mother's Day into the context of the story from beginning to end just proves how great a storyteller he is. As a big reader, I can always appreciate something that comes full-circle, so to speak."
araragi,3dc9gw,awpaca,7,Wed Jul 15 04:22:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I never liked this arc or Hachikuji's character. The gag, while memorable (some would say iconic), was boring and repetitive to me. I do, however, remember the second time I watched this arc and really getting a bit emotional simply because the climax was something I honestly didn't see coming. I never would've guessed the twist, and although it's not exactly super original, it was handled and presented very cleverly. The realization hit hard and the desperation in Araragi's character really shows. I like it because it shows to what emotional potential this show had at the time and later, repeatedly succeeded to reach.  I'd also like to make a special mention to a major flaw in Araragi's character that is shown to us early on (though something we don't really take into account until much later in the series when it's far too apparent to not notice) and that is his very obvious, very shameless White-Knighting. He is a meddlesome MC and his white-knighting alone is boring to no end (if you ask me). His saving grace is actually the fact that he has a perverted but also ""straight-man"" thing going for him. Not to mention the way he sort of begins to emulate Oshino later on in the series and the fact that he can demonstrate self-awareness is key. Granted, he's still dense as fuck and this is played up a lot for some of the heavier, more emotional and romantic plot points, but he has much more self-awareness that any other basic ""heroic"" MC with a harem could ever have.  Back to the point, overall this arc was incredibly dialogue heavy. Definitely one I couldn't appreciate fully until I rewatched the entire series a few times. I gave this arc a 6/10 as an entry level arc (meaning the first time I watched it) but an 8/10 overall when compared to the rest of the arcs in the series."
araragi,3dc9gw,Ars_Y,9,Wed Jul 15 04:22:55 2015 UTC,I think a lot of the problems Koyomi has as a MC of a harem anime are fixed by the fact that he actually chooses a girlfriend but still manages to keep his harem intact.
araragi,3dc9gw,awpaca,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yup! I can agree with that, but I also feel that because he demonstrates a much better sense of self-awareness, it makes him feel less like the generic white-knight MC and more the grounded type of white knight who is sort of conscious of the choices he's making. To be fair, my statement hold true more-so later on in SS and onwards as opposed to the earlier seasons when he's younger."
araragi,3dc9gw,Ars_Y,7,Wed Jul 15 04:33:11 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I don't really consider this to be a true harem anime. Koyomi gets his girl in episode 3 and keeps her the entire series. There's never a real threat of someone else coming in and taking him away. Kanbaru is a Lesbian, he doesn't have feelings for Hanekawa, Hachikuji and Shinobu are really nothing more than good friends to him (even if he is perverted as hell around them), his sisters are well... his sisters, and worst girl while infatuated with him, never had a shot with him.   I see this more of white knight chronicles of him defending the women around him than it being a true harem. It's harem-esque, it totally follows a lot of the tropes, but it's a far cry from an actual harem where he stays mostly unclaimed and keeps all these women around wanting his cock for 3 seasons."
araragi,3dc9gw,JubJub87,6,Wed Jul 15 05:16:11 2015 UTC,"You know, even though Hitagi is his gf I always felt he was closest with Shinobu/K-Shot by default, esp in SS."
araragi,3dc9gw,HayabusaZeroZ,6,Wed Jul 15 12:04:11 2015 UTC,"He loves Hitagi, but he lives and dies with Shinobu."
araragi,3dc9gw,Dopparn10,2,Wed Jul 15 23:45:46 2015 UTC,"It's like the difference between your lover and your best friend. Though it's a bit more complicated than that in Koyomi's case, that's how I tend to view it."
araragi,3dc9gw,Faryshta,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:25:12 2015 UTC,In some episode he said: Senjougahara is my girlfriend but I love Hanekawa. And he will die with shinobu anyway

araragi,3dc9gw,Faryshta,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:25:42 2015 UTC,"The thing is, One Guy Surrounded By X Girls Who Want His Body is the definitionf of a Harem Anime (as long as X > 2).  However, the Monogatari series plays this angle as secondary, and chooses to twist, bend and ignore the trope for the sake of the story and/or entertaining the audience.  If you want to see it in another way, it's a Harem Anime in which none of the Characters are Harem Anime Characters."
araragi,3dc9gw,awpaca,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:37:06 2015 UTC,actually thats pretty realistic in imo. Socially addecuate Guy + hot girlfriend = lots of girls approaching you and acting flirty.  I have only observed it sadly i am not a socially addecuate person.
araragi,3dc9gw,awpaca,5,Thu Jul 16 21:35:43 2015 UTC,"This arc gets me so teared up knowing what is to come, and then I stop having tears and only happiness. Hachikuji is super sad."
araragi,3dc9gw,FireSpyke,3,Wed Jul 15 04:26:11 2015 UTC,It always gets to me at the realization! I get a little lump in my throat and can't help but feel so bad for her :(

araragi,3dc9gw,JubJub87,5,Wed Jul 15 04:44:23 2015 UTC,"As others have said this arc is very dialogue heavy. While that isn't automatically a bad thing, I do feel that certain moments were a little hard to get through.  The arc is about Hachikuji in name, but the real focus is more on Senjougahara and her feelings for Araragi. To me, those were the most enjoyable parts of the arc. When she left for a part in the middle I felt that it started to become less enjoyable. Hachikuji can be a fun character and she has some good moments in this arc, but I feel that it pales in comparison to the interactions between Araragi and Senjougahara."
araragi,3dc9gw,agh-,3,Wed Jul 15 04:42:26 2015 UTC,"In fact, it's a common theme in all of Mayoi-""centric"" stories: the main point is never her, but something else somewhat related to her. More about this when we watch Mayoi Jiangshi and Shinobu Time."
araragi,3dc9gw,JubJub87,6,Fri Jul 17 08:30:34 2015 UTC,"Some people don't like the dialogue-heavy parts of this arc or the series for that matter, but it basically sealed the deal for Monogatari for me, particularly the playground dialogue scene. I dig these random, seemingly aimless, witty conversations. (As a side note, the playground dialogue scene between Hitagi and Araragi reminded me greatly of Spice and Wolf, another dialogue-heavy series and one of the few shows I technically rate higher than Monigatari.)"
araragi,3dc9gw,are_you_a_walrus,4,Wed Jul 15 07:42:06 2015 UTC,This is the point where I fell in love with the show. The dialogue between characters took off like a rocket in the park and kept going strong after words. The lines that Hachikuji and Araragi share are some of the most charming moments of the series.
araragi,3dc9gw,Jammintk,3,Wed Jul 15 23:43:44 2015 UTC,"i unexpected teared up at the end of this arc  two things:   i did not expect mayoi to be reintroduced the narrative tension and emotional buildup was extremely well crafted, and this is the point where i fell in love with the series"

araragi,3dc9gw,awpaca,2,Wed Jul 15 04:56:32 2015 UTC,I really really hate the OP for this arc. It doesn't fit with the aesthetic of the show as a whole and is very jarring and annoying. This is pretty strange because most of the other OPs and EDs are so crazy good.
araragi,3dc9gw,JubJub87,2,Wed Jul 15 21:15:58 2015 UTC,But I feel like it does reflect the outward appearance that Hachikuji tries to keep.

She is direct, conceals her fears very good and actually fight her fears without you ever noticing she was afraid in the first place.  also her soft flirty voice is so relaxing.  both of them playing in the park looks like a very innocent date. Chapter 3 is my favorite on the entire series.  They meet each other on day 8, day 9 they only saw each other till sunrise and then on day 10 Hitagi was sure she was in love. I wish I could ever be so sure about something in my life."

At one point they cross a street and the characters become a bit 'fuzzy' (part 2, 7:50). I think this may be the intersection where Hachikuji.     The best AMV to come from these episodes (perhaps the best from the entire series)."

araragi,3d2o5v,theswerto,18,Mon Jul 13 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"This was the arc that shy-ed me away from the series until I was ready for a dialogue driven series. But when I finally got around to watching it, it quickly become one of my favorites.   This arc does a wonderful job of establishing Araragi as a character, after these first two episodes hardly anything else needs to be told to us about him."
araragi,3d2o5v,JubJub87,5,Mon Jul 13 02:30:27 2015 UTC,Actually I think Nisemonogatari did the best job of making Koyomi's character stronger. At least the perverted side of his. Bake-Koyomi is much more serious.
araragi,3d2o5v,Ars_Y,6,Mon Jul 13 02:34:17 2015 UTC,"I think he just gets a lot braver around characters other than Hitagi, but I agree, he gets some nice development through the whole series."
araragi,3d2o5v,JubJub87,4,Mon Jul 13 02:44:16 2015 UTC,"There's a big shift in the series in Bake as well (not sure if it's on purpose) during June 13th date with Hitagi where Koyomi becomes a lot funnier and comedic than he was in past arcs; more specifically the ""tsukommi"" department."
araragi,3d2o5v,Ars_Y,2,Mon Jul 13 02:51:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think making him more perverted made his character stronger. In my opinion Nisemonogatari hurt Araragi's character more than anything. He was still funny and a bit of a perv in Bake, but it practically became his driving character trait in Nise. I for one, enjoyed the Araragi that was capable of being more serious and I feel like we haven't really seen that side except in very small doses since Bake."
araragi,3d2o5v,FireSpyke,4,Mon Jul 13 03:16:47 2015 UTC,Hanamonogatari had a pretty serious Koyomi.
araragi,3d2o5v,TheUltimateShammer,5,Mon Jul 13 05:29:03 2015 UTC,"You're right, it did. As did Second Season in small doses. I really enjoyed all of those parts and I'm just saying it makes me kinda sad that they've been less frequent after Bake. I do enjoy a lot of the humor of the series, but I feel like some of it (especially in Nise) takes away from the characters. Araragi in Nise kinda feels like a mockery of his self from Bake, and I personally found a hard time enjoying it as much."
araragi,3d2o5v,FireSpyke,11,Mon Jul 13 06:44:36 2015 UTC,"The first time I watched it I thought it was a serious scene, but nowadays whenever I see stumpy Kiss-Shot during the prologue I crack up so bad.  Favorite scene is when Meme lays down the law on the crab. Rarely see him in action (physically). Since Kagenui is powerful as well, always makes me wonder how good Kaiki would be in a fist fight; he can certainly take a beating, if Koimonogatari shows anything.  Also, I'm always in awe at how the art has improved from Bake to Tsuki.  Edit: Hate to be that guy, but Yotsugi Doll only has one ""l"" in the OP."

But that's like saying China's a very small country because Russia is bigger. And, then again, he does have inhuman agility and acrobatic skills, but that kind of suits his style. To use RPG terms, I would wager he's like the fragile thief/ranger/whatever class that doesn't like to get dirty but can still do quite a bit of damage through other means."
araragi,3d2o5v,Conny_and_Theo,14,Mon Jul 13 03:06:03 2015 UTC,Kaiki Hanamonogatari is probably the funniest scene in the series.
araragi,3d2o5v,JubJub87,8,Mon Jul 13 03:15:31 2015 UTC,Followed by Hanamonogatari

araragi,3d2o5v,Ars_Y,4,Mon Jul 13 03:10:59 2015 UTC,"A bit pedantic here, but rogue would be better than ranger for that description. In D&D anyways, yeah a ranger can use a bow, but they're also skilled in duel wielding and survival in the wilderness. Whereas rogues are the ones that make the best use of Move Silently, Hide, etc and even get a Hide in Plain Sight feat later on. And they are very useful to have higher charisma with."
araragi,3d2o5v,TheUltimateShammer,2,Mon Jul 13 05:41:58 2015 UTC,"Well Kaiki can run pretty fast, he'd prolly do that."
araragi,3d2o5v,Wraith000,9,Tue Jul 14 05:41:09 2015 UTC,"The first time I started the series, the scene that struck me the most was the one where Hitagi is going around in her underwear for several minutes. I did not even consider the possibility that that was fanservice because it seemed so natural and in-character for her - and, indeed, it was very much natural and in-character. It was like moments after the scene ended I was thinking, ""wait a moment, did I just watch a girl going around in her panties without thinking 'lol stupid creators throwing fanservice at me'"". Though it was the long-ass playground dialogue in episode 3 that convinced me that Monogatari was good, this scene certainly helped me at least have a very good first impression of the series, so to speak."
araragi,3d2o5v,Conny_and_Theo,7,Mon Jul 13 02:03:06 2015 UTC,"This is why when outsiders always point to the fact that the series is riddled with fanservice, we always counter with the fact that its played so well with plot development (the real kind of plot) that it doesn't even affect the storytelling.  And it's true. In fact, fanservice is sometimes a catalyst for story development: see Tsukimonogatari.  Honestly, the episode that made me think Monogatari was a good show was probably Nadeko's arc, since Ren'ai Circulation was so damn catchy. Yeah, I'm that kind of fan."

araragi,3d2o5v,Conny_and_Theo,3,Mon Jul 13 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"Really late to this, Blu Rays just came in last night.   I've forgotten how amazingly well they introduced us to the character of Hitagi. We see her completely transform over the course of two episodes - initially violent and distant, threatening Koyomi for offering to help and showing concern, to mocking him as he sees her naked in her home, to her grateful thanks to him after her cure.  Staple Stable remains one of the better Monogatari OPs (which is saying a lot, they're almost all universally amazing).   Koyomi-Hitagi is truly the best OTP in anime. (Even if Kanbaru is best girl).   Really looking forward to finishing this series with the rest of you guys, it's going to be a long day tomorrow waiting to post the midnight thread for Mayoi's arc."
araragi,3d2o5v,Faryshta,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:05:19 2015 UTC,whats otp?
araragi,3d2o5v,awpaca,2,Tue Jul 14 17:13:54 2015 UTC,One true pair.
araragi,3d2o5v,Faryshta,0,Tue Jul 14 17:29:45 2015 UTC,Kirito and Asuna are a great pair too.  Actually I think in all anime the only couples which you actually see falling in love with each other are Kirito + Asuna and Koyomi + Hitagi.
araragi,3d2o5v,AdrianWillis22,5,Tue Jul 14 18:30:33 2015 UTC,"Alright. So this is going to be my third time through the series. (Although Im technically still on my second time - since I need to watch Hana and Tsuki still - which I have put off for like 2 months now.)  After my second watch, I read Kizumonogatari. Having read Kizu my thoughts on my first two watches were not accurate for the quick flashback of Kizu at the beginning.  Kizu spoiler  I still don't see the need to read the quick text. Maybe on my fourth watch lol.  This series is still so beautiful - visually and sound wise.  I recently downloaded a different copy to the series since there wasn't openings and endings during the episodes. I have seen all the OPs and EDs but never during and episode - I love the transition into the beautiful song.  NOOO I can't watch these subs. Hanekawa just said ""I don't know everything. I just happen to know this""  Well that just killed todays rewatch for me. Ill try to catch up later but Im done for the night."
araragi,3d2o5v,JubJub87,3,Mon Jul 13 02:08:54 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting translation of Hanekawa's catch phrase. It actually makes more sense so I could see why they used it.  I haven't bothered pausing and reading the texts either. I did in Koimonogatari though, because Kaiki has some pretty damn funny things to think."
araragi,3d2o5v,Ralon17,2,Mon Jul 13 02:32:22 2015 UTC,What's the Hanekawa line you're used to?

araragi,3d2o5v,HayabusaZeroZ,3,Tue Jul 14 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"It is so odd to see Senjougahara act the way she does toward Koyomi after having watched all of the Monogatari anime. Like, damn, character development."

The second time we see it, she is sitting on a cushion she got from her house. You can see the cushion sitting on the floor while she's getting dressed."

Usually they just end up talking about character analysis and their experience working on the show as seiyuu. Some of it is funny, like Hanazawa jokingly expressed a bit of, ""WTF, m8,"" over the fact that Nadeko Snake is only two episodes. Another time was when Saito and Sawashiro were gushing over Sakurai Takahiro's voice. Sometimes production staff is invited as well. My favorite one to listen to was probably the one with Saito and Sawashiro.  They add like... 5% more to the total Monogatari experience. Not totally necessary, but I'd recommend you listen to them all if you have a free morning/afternoon.  Edit: I think I should clarify/reiterate that the radio show doesn't actually add anything to the Nisio Isin novels, and just provides trivia-type information about the anime. For instance, Iguchi tells us in her segment that she originally auditioned for the part of Nadeko before the staff felt she was a better fit for Tsukihi. So small, little things like that. You don't have to listen to it, but it just deepens the appreciation for the series if you're a fan."
