Neither one of these idiots went about the process in the correct way.  You don't like a monument you feel is racist in front of a county building? Then go through the proper civic channels and to get it removed and let your voice be heard the correct fucking way. Don't be some childish asshat that defaces public property. You're not fucking Banksy bro, you're a fucking asshole.  You want to show your support for southern heritage and honor their memories? Then show up to the protest with an anti-protest sign, or exercise your civic right to assemble like-minded individuals and show your support for this monument. Don't fucking show up with your bargain-price AR-15 look-alike rifle and try to intimidate people exercising their right to free assembly. Your not fucking Robert E Lee defending the south from northern aggression, you're a fucking asshole.

Using vandalism kind of ignores the support and popularity of the efforts since it looks like someone felt this was the only way to get the issue attention. Vandalism as protest was not warranted here.
Denton,3dy5l6,Geese-a-ka,6,Mon Jul 20 15:28:12 2015 UTC,How do you figure it was going to be successful? They took a break when they realized how difficult it was going to be and how many people disagreed with them.

Denton,3dy5l6,miskerswhiskers,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:41:26 2015 UTC,I don't think that will have any impact on it's removal. The county has already modified the monument before in order to remove the segregated fountains (or the signs anyway). Honestly it belongs in a museum.

Or at least people ignorant to historical context.   EDIT: Wedentondoit did a really good write up on the history of the monument. You can find that here: WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE CONFEDERATE MONUMENT ON THE SQUARE TL;DR: it was raised when the city of Denton was doing some really shitty things to their black residents. The KKK connections don't really help anything out.
Denton,3dy5l6,teddybearoveralls,9,Mon Jul 20 15:09:37 2015 UTC,"The writeup sounds like the memorial is actually a conglomerate of different aspects of history, though. The original arch was erected by the UDC to honor their fathers who fought and died, even though some of them didn't even want to. The segregated fountain add-ons, however, were not intended as far as I know, and don't represent the original intent of the monument.  Personally, I believe history bears noticing, good or bad. I believe the Confederacy was primarily built on the institution of slavery, and the flag represents that, nothing less. That being said, let the dead sleep. Denton does not pride itself on its Confederate history, you don't see countless effigies in the likeness of notable Confederate figures, you merely see a statue honoring the fallen."
Denton,3dy5l6,spasticjedi,9,Mon Jul 20 18:50:49 2015 UTC,Just because I used to work at the Courthouse on the Square Museum and this is my number one pet peeve:  OH MY GOD THERE WERE NEVER ANY SEGREGATED WATER FOUNTAINS. THERE IS NO PLUMBING IN THE MEMORIAL.  Please stop spreading this urban myth. It was started by one individual that comes in to court almost every month to request the statue is torn down because he is offended by any mention of the Confederacy. Don't let him rewrite history.

Denton,3dy5l6,TheDENTONAUT,3,Mon Jul 20 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"It's not that I don't believe you, but more that your comment made me curious - and since you worked at the museum...  There are two separate bowls on the memorial with drains in them (usually clogged with gunk now).  If they weren't water fountains, what were they?  It seems as though it was at least designed with plumbing in mind."
Denton,3dy5l6,trebory6,3,Mon Jul 20 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify: the monument fountains never worked since water pipes were never budgeted to run out to it. However, there were segregated fountains inside (and elsewhere outside) the Courthouse, typical of the times. But yes, the monument was designed with separate fountains for an express purpose and it was a mail-order from one of several monument-makers catering to the UDC market. Did this monument have racist motivations? Without doubt. But most UDC saw it as honoring ole Grandpappy who fought in a war that almost half of Denton had voted against. No cowards, they volunteered to go to war and they were also conscripted (drafted) into it so ""memorializing the dead"" is no simple black-or-white affair. Denton County and NTX had plenty of abolitionist and ""Union League"" sympathizers, many of whom were forced by duty or law to join the CSA.

Denton,3dy5l6,dentonturkey,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:17:18 2015 UTC,"I think that at one point, water fountains were suggested, but there were two not because of segregation but because one basin on an arch looks stupid. They'd be two identical (not separate but equal, but actually totally interchangeable) fountains.  But those plans never went through and they became planters for a few years, then kind of became the wonderful mosquito breeding grounds they are today."
Denton,3dy5l6,blockduuuuude,3,Mon Jul 20 23:07:06 2015 UTC,"Teddy, read up on the monument manufacturer... those separate fountains are no accident of architecture. That they never worked is entirely besides the point."

Just because I'm defending the statue, does NOT mean I'm a racist or racism sympathizer.   Confederacy is part of the roots of Denton, like it or not. Denton has been shitty to black communities in the past, that's a fact, but at the same time you can't rewrite out all the bad history just because it makes some people upset.  In my opinion, the most appropriate action would be for Denton to put up a plaque explaining the history, and to make the history clear, while also showing how far Denton has moved past it.  I mean people are not getting rid of Hitler statues in concentration camp museums in Germany because it is a part of history.   Edit to add:  The thing that is throwing me completely off, is how you guys can take a piece of history, for better or worse, and say ""I don't like this so therefore it shouldn't exist."" If everyone had that mentality nobody would know much about WWII, the trail of tears would be a conspiracy, and the world would seem like an absolute perfect place because all the bad history would be edited out just to make some people appeased."

The thing that bothers me when people say they want the statue to come down isn't the idea of the statue, it's what it stands for. Nobody erected that statue to say ""fuck yeah, racist ideals and whatnot"", it's there as a memorial to soldiers who fought and died for what they believed in. The same soldiers who are technically US Veterans because of the act passed in 1958. To deface and remove the statue, I feel, is far more disrespectful to those people than it is to folks tho want to complain about racism.

Or we can let them serve as a reminder. In my opinion, and maybe I am wrong, but the statue serves as a reminder of how far this country has come.

It is an attempt to honor them, and frankly, we just should not be honoring them in any way. The cause that they fought for was heinously immoral. It is a very dark and shameful part of American history. Those who are against this memorial are not trying to rewrite history. We just don't want to honor it."

Denton,3dy5l6,2slow2curious,-6,Mon Jul 20 16:42:52 2015 UTC,There is a HUGE difference between honoring fallen soldiers (who gives a fuck what they were fighting for? They died and their daughters were sad so they put up a statue to honor them) and desecrating land. Don't you fucking DARE equate the two.  Where the fuck are you from that you think you're so much better than us?
Denton,3dy5l6,Geese-a-ka,8,Mon Jul 20 19:56:26 2015 UTC,"""Who gives a fuck what they were fighting for""   Your argument is very bad. Those that fought for the Nazi cause had daughters that were sad when they died. It doesn't mean their communities should be obligated to erect a monument on government property honoring them. The problem is, there is no way to honor soldiers of a cause without also bringing honor to the cause in which they fought for. When we erect a monument honoring Confederate soldiers, we are honoring what the Confederacy stood for (slavery) whether you like it or not."
Denton,3dy5l6,2slow2curious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:29:58 2015 UTC,"They died and their daughters were sad so they put up a statue to honor them   The ""Daughters of the Confederacy"" was an advocacy organization set up to care for Confederate Veterans (because when you lose a war you don't really get paid) and when they set up that statue they were pretty vehemently defending Jim Crow and segregation."

Texas is able change its stance and further human rights as the years roll by, but those young men will still have died for what she once believed in. If Texas had listened to its senator at the time, Sam Houston, and remained in the Union there wouldn't even be an argument on whether or not we should honor these soldiers' sacrifice."

It's important to remember history, but we don't need this statue in the middle of downtown Denton in order to do that. We could relocate it, or put it inside the museum (as opposed to on the lawn).  The reality is that the majority of the country laughs at places with Confederate flags and monuments, because regardless of what you think it should represent, it's widely seen as representing slavery and racism."
Denton,3dy5l6,Geese-a-ka,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:03 2015 UTC,Part of reconstruction was passing by law that all confederate soldiers were U.S. Veterans.   That means this monument is the same as any other US veteran memorial.  Please stop trying to tear down the past because it offends you.

Denton,3dy5l6,BaldKnobber,2,Mon Jul 20 20:28:35 2015 UTC,"If you're worried about how a statue makes you look to others I think you care too much about what others think of you, especially those that are willing to have their opinions formed by architecture created 150 years ago.  Also, we have a fundamental disagreement on what the statue represents. You insist it represents racism and slavery. I say that it is a fallen war memorial.  Everything on the statue backs the idea that it is a fallen soldier war memorial. Looking into the history of the people behind the statue you find some people who were racist. Which should be of no surprise to anyone. But does that mean the statue is now also racist and pro-slavery? I don't think so. Many good things were created by racists, same as many good things were made by non-racists. I don't think it is fair to attack something for which it's creators did not know any better."
Denton,3dy5l6,crwcomposer,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"architecture created 150 years ago   First of all, it doesn't date back to the civil war. It's less historical than that (so hopefully you weren't basing its value on that). It's not even 100 years old.   we have a fundamental disagreement on what the statue represents   That's irrelevant. It doesn't matter what you or I think it represents. It matters what most people think it represents, because individuals don't get to choose those things. Just like I can't force people to use 'literally' in its original sense, even though sometimes I'd like to."

But yeah, when I take friends to the square, sometimes they're surprised that the city I live in has let a Confederate monument sit in the middle of downtown for so long. And it's kind of embarrassing for me that I've told them how great Denton is, and yet its residents have let this monument to racism and slavery sit there for so long.  And yes, that's how many people see it, even if you don't. And it affects their view of Denton, even if just a little bit.

Bernie is the only candidate who gets this."
Denton,3dmmdn,jackhawkian,2,Fri Jul 17 21:59:52 2015 UTC,"Serious question here, what is Bernie's plan?   Reading his platform ""on the issues"", it reads just like a wishlist of things he wants to happen in a fairy tale land. I've yet to see Sanders offer any actual solutions to problems, just state his end-goals.   How are people supposed to support Sanders when all he brings to the table is the same dreams we heard in the USSR?"

Denton,3dmmdn,blueorchestra,10,Fri Jul 17 16:48:51 2015 UTC,"Common rebuttal given by the tea party. Bernie's primary platform is to strengthen the middle class and stick it to the 1% who stop at nothing to get even richer and richer, destroy the unions, and move America to a two class plutachy: the poor and the very rich. He's spoken at great length about practical things that could do this, most important being Wall Street reform and getting Congress out of the back pocket of Goldman Sachs. It sounds like you haven't listened to anything he has to say."

That was their plan to achieve their dreams (Ending the ruling class, giving power to the workers, income equality). We haven't heard what Sanders' plan is, just what his dreams are.

Denton,3dmmdn,stringcheese_cocaine,11,Fri Jul 17 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"First, Sanders' platform states very clearly a number of concrete policy preferences ranging from reinstating some version of Glass-Steagall to reducing (or eliminating) tuition costs for students at public universities to a minimum wage hike to working to overturn the Citizen United SCOTUS decision. It's impossible to claim that these don't constitute substantive policy objectives or that they aren't clearly stated in Sanders' campaign literature while also purporting to be literate.  Second, the comment attempts to draw some parallel between a Vermont Senator with social democratic leanings to Stalin. It's patently absurd, and, as such, deserves downvotes."
Denton,3dmmdn,1261644,-5,Fri Jul 17 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"You say his platform clearly states that, and that's great, so inform him of the policies he's unaware of. I don't think he's saying Bernie is comparable to Stalin.  And again, just because his opinion or question is what you think is out there doesn't mean it isn't constructive to a conversation. What he is talking about is relevant to the link."
Denton,3dmmdn,stringcheese_cocaine,4,Fri Jul 17 18:09:02 2015 UTC,"If ""constructive"" is London, comments implying Sanders is a Bolshevik are Tokyo."
Denton,3dmmdn,1261644,-5,Fri Jul 17 18:14:08 2015 UTC,"As we all know, the USSR completely ceased to exist after Stalin, therefore anytime someone draws parallels of the political tendencies of the USSR, you must always assume they were talking about one of the most ruthless men the world has ever known  /s  I get that Sander's wants to overturn Citizen's United, but that's not something the president can do. You need to pass a law which probably won't happen. How does he plan to get rid of tuition costs? You can't just wave a magic wand and suddenly things are completely free.   I get the goals. What's the road we take to get there?"
Denton,3dmmdn,mwthink,3,Fri Jul 17 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"I would love for you to enlighten me as to exactly which Bolshevik or Soviet luminary you had in mind when you tried to equate Sen. Sanders' views with the Soviet Union.  These latter questions are more reasonable. With regard to Citizens United, he's said he'd choose SCOTUS nominees in his administration based on this question of the difference between natural and juridical persons as pertains to political activities and the regulation thereof. He's also proposed related legislation, I believe. His plan for tuition was apparently to subsidize tuition with a financial transaction fee, I think. But I don't work for the campaign.  Your first comment was red-baiting and not at all made in good faith. These other, more specific questions are more constructive."
Denton,3dmmdn,1261644,-7,Fri Jul 17 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"What's the road we take to get there?    Heavy taxation. Then, once the government is paying for higher education they can allocate students to whatever degree is currently needed. ""You want to study Literature? Sorry, there is no demand for that. We need more Electricians. If you want free education you study to be Electrician."""
Denton,3dmmdn,TheKurgan454,5,Fri Jul 17 18:26:05 2015 UTC,"Since university education is generally debt-financed by middle and working class students and their families, most often via the federal government, this sort of thing could already happen, but doesn't. There's no reason to assume that a system of grants or scholarships or other forms of debt-free student aid would be attended by such a system of ""allocation"" as you describe."

Your contention is that if exactly this circumstance exists, some sort of awful rationing will make it impossible for a student to get a degree in the humanities. That's just an absurd argument.  You may have other objections to broader tuition assistance without such heavy debt burdens, but arguing that allowing government to provide grants or other funding (which it already does) will result in extreme forms of rationing doesn't make sense. That's an outcome that is really just as likely under our present system as it would be if the government provided more grants and fewer loans."

It's pretty hard to construe it as anything other than a clumsy attempt to highlight what he perceived as the strangeness of relations between men and women at the time.  His record demonstrates a commitment to women's rights and legislation that protects the same.

Denton,3dmmdn,pokepal,-4,Sat Jul 18 05:12:33 2015 UTC,"I know that's what you guys like to think and I know that's a very comforting thought, but the fact remains: this guy suggested that women fantasize about rape.   He didn't just do something as innocent as think about it. He didn't just keep it in his head like we all do when crazy thoughts drift past our consciousness from time to time. He didn't play with it in his head or just consider it as some abstract situation that maybe a minuscule percentile of the female population do when they have sex. No, he he took the time to think about it, theorize, posit a rationale for it, reconsider it, confirm it in his own head, type it, and fucking submit it to a journalist he knew would publish it.  He owned this sentence. He owned this essay he wrote.  He put it out there and signed his name to it. I'm simply reminding those that want to pretend he's a viable candidate for president that that he wrote this shit and had it published. Anyone that says shit like that and MEANS IT  doesn't get  be president. I don't give a fuck how nice a guy he is. I don't give a fuck how long ago it happened. He wrote that essay as something that he thought was acceptable and appropriate and submitted it to a journal that he knew would be distributed to women.  Fuck Bernard Sanders simply for the words in that essay.  You don't get to be president, Bernie, you fucking moron. Stay in the local capacity you're in and be happy you have a job.

I use Denton animal hospital on teasley ln. They always care about the animals and get you on a payment plan if you can't pay on the spot.

""do you have any cash? Like extra?"" I stared into his soul with a Bruce Lee death stare and he knew what was up. Up until the point he cynically smiled, looked down at my kid at my side, and attempted to pat his head. I grabbed the top part of his hand and easily could have snapped his wrist using his own weight and leverage. I just said ""don't."" He quickly backed off. I had a blk t shirt on w a small white Glock logo on it. Pretty sure he noticed it when I had his hand. ... He was walking from that side street where Flatlanders & OSDH is. & at like 630p about a wk ago. Be careful ppl, dude was that brazen w families walking around at that time, who knows how much more of a nuisance he could have been later at night. (Didn't call police, probably should have, but my phone was at like 3% and I didn't have a charger on our drive home.) again, just be aware of your surroundings. Nothing against homeless redditors or anything, but that's all it takes is that 1 out of 20 homeless dude that tries to pull something off."

Denton,3d52ls,boom_wildcat,5,Mon Jul 13 18:45:12 2015 UTC,But he wasn't asking for help. The dude surprised someone while in their car and asked for money. That's awfully close to being accosted.

Denton,3d2srn,Necoras,5,Mon Jul 13 05:01:43 2015 UTC,"That's like your server bringing you your food but making it clear he doesn't think he should have to serve you in the first place.

Denton,3d2srn,Khanstant,2,Mon Jul 13 05:04:45 2015 UTC,"Difference between a server and a judge?   The judge is elected. Besides, from your immediate position of ""Judges are dubious"" I think you're just slightly biased in this conversation.  Personally, I have no problem with how he is handling it. I can't expect everyone who hates this to be all smiles and rainbows, but as long as he does it, I could give a rat's ass about his personal opinion on it."
Denton,3d2srn,Geese-a-ka,3,Mon Jul 13 16:27:01 2015 UTC,"His personal opinion doesn't need to be on his judicial stationary.  He can keep it to himself or at home.  The fact he needs a proclamation to let people know he really doesn't like it is petty.  I would never feel comfortable with this man's impartiality, and he is unfit to be an elected official."
Denton,3d2srn,gumboshrimps,-5,Mon Jul 13 17:52:03 2015 UTC,"I could give a rats ass about his opinion as well, hence my rude posts regarding him. Keep it to yourself. And yes, I am of course biased, what being a person and all."

Understand there is some leeway here for someone who doesn't like it and move on. He is still doing his job but complaining like a baby. Does no good to complain about him as well. Move on.

Denton,3d2srn,Davekoen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:54:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty much anyone can solemnize marriages in the state of Texas. If you are ordained by your religion (even through an online church like the Universal Life Church Monastery), then you are allowed to perform legal marriages in the state. It's very easy and costs under $100 to get your paperwork.   I'm sure there are plenty of people in Denton who have done this and would love to perform a same sex marriage. Why give people like DePizza the satisfaction of being a jerk to people on what should be one of the happiest days of their lives."
Denton,3d2srn,NeilZod,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely true, but most of those people are not drawing their salary from Denton County taxpayers, and he is. He owes the county that employs him better that this pissy ""only because I'm being made to, but it'll be by my rules"" gesture. It's just so petty of him."
Denton,3d2srn,NeilZod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. He's being a whiny, pain in the ass because he feels that he is entitled to and that isn't right.   But, if people don't want to deal with this kind of crap, there are other options where they can be legally married by people who feel that their union is just as important and valid as a heterosexual couple."
Denton,3d2srn,NeilZod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:41:18 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree. Again, however, that is not my point. My point is that a public official should not be entitled to such latitude. He's basically just insulting people he doesn't like, and a ruling he disagrees with. More, he's making affirmation of that immaturity a condition of a service he provides as required by law and at public expense. It seriously skirts the edge of what's probably actually legal, and might well cross it. That's the issue I meant to address with this. A public servant is acting like he has the personal right to behave like this.  To put that pettiness into perspective, I recast it to nearly exactly identical circumstances of the past. From our modern perspective, his conduct now would have been outrageous then."
Denton,3cyp1p,obackbaroma,18,Sat Jul 11 23:57:42 2015 UTC,It's way better than Rusty taco or mi casita but the price per taco is kinda steep. They stuff them with a lot of fixings but if you want to fill up you will be spending 15 bucks
Denton,3cyp1p,Hrup,10,Sun Jul 12 00:42:04 2015 UTC,"I went opening week, so they might have changed... but  They're decent, but overpriced for what it is. If I were to go get tacos, I personally prefer the real mexican places like Sabrocita or Estrella. Sabrocita is 5 tacos and a drink for like $8, whereas that in Flatlanders is give/take $15+  I'll give them another shot soon, especially if I am going to oak street drafthouse, but as it stands, I prefer Rusty"
Denton,3cyp1p,DrIblis,4,Sun Jul 12 02:10:46 2015 UTC,I concur on all points.
Denton,3cyp1p,kerry63,-3,Sun Jul 12 22:13:31 2015 UTC,Lol at Sabrocita. The worst taqueria in Denton for sure. They don't even have chorizo. Go to Gunajuato for real Mexican tacos
Denton,3cyp1p,IcanAutoFellate,11,Sun Jul 12 04:52:01 2015 UTC,"There are better, truer taquerias in town, but you're mad if you believe La Sabrosa Sabrocita isn't amazing."

Denton,3cyp1p,DrIblis,5,Sun Jul 12 12:05:25 2015 UTC,"I think the tacos are pretty great, but my favorite thing on the menu is the bacon torta. The bread is slightly sweet, the bacon is thick and crispy, and it comes with chips so you can scoop up all the black  beans that fall out. I have cravings for that sandwich.    Also, I'm a fan of the coffee. The small size is teeny-tiny, (that was a surprise) but Addison roasts some damn fine coffee beans and I'm stoked that I can find some in Denton now."
Denton,3cyp1p,PencilSkirt17,3,Sun Jul 12 02:23:46 2015 UTC,Yep! Their tortas are the way to order for everyone here saying they need more food for the money. I love the coffee too.

Denton,3cyp1p,catsweaterlol,2,Sun Jul 12 05:34:53 2015 UTC,"Tacos San Pedro   They're over-priced and not that good, IMO. They also charge for drink refills. What restaurant these days charges for drink refills?"

Denton,3cyp1p,vivahate_9110,3,Wed Jul 15 14:35:12 2015 UTC,I had them once about a couple of weeks ago. They're basically premium street tacos for the price and quality. It's actually really good and hell a lot better than Rusty's and Fuzzy's if you're all about fresh ingredients and flavor. I highly recommenced going there if you're willing to spend some extra cash on some good tacos.
Denton,3cyp1p,GravityRides,9,Sun Jul 12 08:00:29 2015 UTC,Only taco place on the square not named after a vagina joke. Worth an extra dollar just for that.

I would definitely be interested in hearing the rest of the story. I mean, when I was 15, I was making a lot of ""adult"" decisions with older guys. I don't know if it's different in other states, but it's illegal regardless of consent. I remember my dad threatening an ex of mine with statutory rape charges. Shit got out of hand.   I don't know the owner at Flatlanders at all, but I'm hoping there isn't a more disturbing version of this story.  Edit: It also appears he served less than a year after he was found guilty. Compared to the other offenders in the same area (10 yrs, 20 yrs, etc.), it seems like a it fits with what I was saying.  Edit #2: Can't find a news story, but I'm even more confused now. His offenses just say ""military""...versus ""aggravated sexual assault"" or ""indecent exposure"" or whatever. Anyone know what that means?

Walmart sells 2lb portions frozen fish in blue bags for $5-10 depending on the type of fish, some with skin and some without: cod, flounder, salmon, etc.  The cod and salmon are individually wrapped inside the bag, too.  As far as the taste, they aren't as amazing as fresh, but they are much more affordable and convenient.  It tates good to us, and we don't waste nearly as much, so it works out for us.  YMMV."

Denton,3cflwh,islandcalypso,5,Tue Jul 7 16:34:59 2015 UTC,What I learned from living in Fort Worth is that there is one every block ran by different Asian cultures and they all make them different. They are low cost businesses that are in extremely low cost buildings mainly family ran so they keep costs low.

Denton,3cchlz,ReferenceError,7,Mon Jul 6 21:27:47 2015 UTC,"Lunch drinks? Kinda limits your options. I like Cool Beans' burgers, and they're open for lunch. They're a bar, so they've got whatever.

Denton,3c5771,vivichase,3,Sat Jul 4 22:16:24 2015 UTC,"Man, I wish I had seen this earlier. I'm assuming you've purchased the piano by now, but just in case you haven't, here is my advice- don't. Take whatever money you would use to buy that piano and buy a digital piano instead. You can get a decent Yamaha P series for 200 dollars, and the more you have to spend, even better. Most digital pianos have weighted keys now, and their portability makes them easy to move. As a fellow pianist, I understand the allure of having an actual piano, they are beautiful and a digital piano will never fully be able to replicate their warmth of sound, but the cool factor of a real piano is easily outweighed by the pain-in-the-balls factor that comes with it. Hiring a specialized mover to get that thing up to tour apt is going to be expensive, and you aren't going to live there forever, so you'll be paying one again when you move out. Plus, digitals have headphones so you can play at all hours and not piss off your neighbors. Having a piano is awesome when you live in a house. A piano in an apartment is a huge hassle, and frankly, is bad neighboring. Consider getting a digital, for real."

We had the pieces donated in the first place, and were able to build the small park.   To build a new place at this point would require a lot of work, since it would be city owned. And, the community hasn't shown much interest to justify the cost, time, and labor of a new park.   If you would like to express interest to the correct people, please send me a DM and I'll give you emails.   Again, I'm sorry if I came off as condescending."

And many of them write down the physical descriptions of people they talk to when responding to a call not to classify you but for them to remember later.

You did say you are new to the area, so you wouldn't be recognized yet and maybe, since it was dark, they didn't see your black dog. It doesn't sound like the officer was profiling you, rather just trying to match the description he was given. Sorry you felt singled out, but I wouldn't read too much into it, as it was probably just an unfortunate misunderstanding."

So generally speaking, most people will support a large governing hand to award those rights, and specifically speaking, mostly only dentonites will be upset about the hb40 bill that passed.  Also people and communities can hold and support two separate ideals and be happy when their government supports those ideals and unhappy when their government does not support them. one more thing, did you say you were pro fracking? thats your right, but this sub will hang you for treason. hope this helped!"

It runs behind the Denton Target and goes north and south through town. Another good option are the trails off of Old Alton Bridge Road (still flooded now, but should be good sometime in the future).    You might consider joining the Denton Area Running Club - they have a few weekly run events, which may make your cardio days more fun.  Happy running!"
Denton,3bpkvp,imgeekynotcool,3,Wed Jul 1 13:15:16 2015 UTC,"Right now the Greenbelt and Clear Creek trail are flooded, but when they dry out they are good.   The Rail Trail is all concrete and relatively flat. You can catch it near the UPS section by Brickhouse. It's about 18 miles, but it's not a loop.   South lakes and North Lakes Park are loops and mostly concrete. There are sections of North Lakes, like the Wildflower Trail, that are crushed granite and more ""rugged.""   Cross Timbers Park is a varied trail, and you could probably make a loop at it. It's made up of crushed granite, little concrete, and sand.  Our nonofficial trail expert is Tracy, and if you want more information feel free to email her at tracy.durmick@cityofdenton.com."
Denton,3bpkvp,DentonParks,2,Wed Jul 1 14:38:27 2015 UTC,North lakes if you're looking for fast and soft Corinth trails if you want something more technical or cross tembers trail has much of both but it's under water right now.

Basically turn off Swisher onto old Alton and park down there by the bridge.  This is assuming it's not still flooded.  Just watch out for the occasional horse.  Great trails though...6 and 12 miles or something like that.

I lived their 2 years ago so I know they changed the rent since then (they shouldn't have, it wasn't even worth what I was paying). It's now listed at $665.   Things were always breaking/leaking. It took 7 months to get a leak fixed. Apparently there was a fucking NAIL driven through our water pipe that had slowly rusted in to the pipe itself and was allowing the leak to break through. Their solution: Tear open the ceiling, replace the pipe, cover giant ceiling hole with black fucking tape. It took some very angry phone calls and a few months to get them to come in and patch it back up. Any request for maintenance was met with ""well we're very busy right now!"" Heat went out during the late spring freezes ""oh we're busy!"" toilet clogs right before the giant ice over, still busy....You see where I'm going with this.  0/10 don't recommend. It looks nice when you tour it, but thats only superficial. Everything (including the foundation of the damn place) is falling apart.   There is no way they could have renovated the place enough to make it livable again these past 2 years, its entire structure/pipes/wiring was fucked (my internet would constantly go out, our lights would flicker like there was something wrong with the wiring and when I called and complained...you know.) It wasn't just my specific apartment either, my neighbor had to make them let her move over to a different building because her apartments foundation was so screwed they had a small hill developing in their floor and they no longer felt safe living there."

We do have some bugs getting in and whatnot mostly because of a crack in a bathroom but its not that bad. They do monthly exterminations on the property. And will come in anytime we ask. Anything breaks we call they come in. Never had any problems and the office staff are really nice to us. We have two pools and laundry rooms onsite as well.

Anyway, the apartment itself is pretty old, but it comes with a fridge and stove.   Our A/C stopped working last summer and maintenance took 2 days to come and fix it. They do take a while to come and fix things. Also, there was a fire a few weeks ago in one of the buildings. One of the residents told me it started between 2 walls and it affect 4 apartment units in the buildings. Looks like they had to move out. Oh yeah, there was a murder suicide recently too.   The walls are pretty thin so I frequently hear one neighbor practicing for band and another watching tv or listening to country music, and another praying upstairs.

Denton,3bnk3r,Johnnybix,3,Tue Jun 30 17:29:47 2015 UTC,"Used to work there. Fantastic work environment, but I can understand how guest satisfaction might occasionally suffer. The biggest problem with the staff is that most of the front of house food runners are highschool students who are wildly unmotivated.  Of course this leads to a very high turnover, which results in new highschool students (or early college aged, I might be exaggerating slightly,) who are not only equally (maybe) unmotivated (a job is a job at this point,) but also untrained. As with any job everywhere, there's the basic training program to cover the basics; again with every job, there are the things you don't learn from training. The absolute worst seasons of service are when the veteran employees leave, leaving the untrained to lead the untrained.  .  Now speaking as a repeating guest: food could certainly be better, but I understand higher quality food would drive the prices even higher. Ticket prices are amongst the lowest (if not THE LOWEST) in town, but a more-than-significant portion goes to overhead and labor. That building costs a lot of money to keep running.  .  Every aspect of it might not be a perfect business model, and might not be perfect for you, but the place is pretty damn fun if you expect it for what it is: a place with some generally alright food (get the cheesy chicken dinner with chicken tossed in the Buffalo sauce, tho for real,) a full bar (drinks are pricey, but the bartenders over pour [don't tell the bosses,]) but first and always, movies are first run. Midnight releases got a little weird after the Aurora thing, but they still show the movies that come out right away (as long as there are screens for it.)  .  Movie Tavern is pretty dope. It's pricey if you wanna go all out, but reasonable if you just wanna split a pitcher of beer with some friends over a couple of hours. Condiments might come out wrong, or food might be the wrong order entirely, but highschool kids don't do well with seat numbers like ""1A12.""  .  Movie Tavern has fantastic, radical, and revolutionary potential, if they could get control of their staff."

Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, 4 for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. 5 Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience. 6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. 7 Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed."

The Supreme Court ruling isn't in effect yet; the court gives roughly three weeks for the losing side to ask for reconsideration.  Some places got their shit together in preparation of the ruling, so they were prepared for it when it happened, and didn't need the extra time. But lots of other places didn't. She (and others) just needed a couple days to get her shit together.

Denton,3b7x0d,hardman52,18,Fri Jun 26 20:04:45 2015 UTC,This is silly. Do they actually think that they're gonna prevail over a Supreme Court ruling?
Denton,3b7x0d,Jarrod,11,Fri Jun 26 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"Based on the article it seems like they are just playing dumb for now and coming up with excuses. They are going to drag their feet as long as they can.  Juli Luke said she had to wait for ""guidance"" from District Attorney Paul Johnson. Then he responded by saying the ""decision whether to issue licenses belonged to the clerk's office"" tossing it back to Juli Luke.  Then Juli put a mysterious sign on her door that said they couldn't issue marriage licenses because of ""changes that must be made for our vendor."" Wtf does that even mean."
Denton,3b7x0d,aewillia,9,Fri Jun 26 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"I've been dealing with this in Arkansas all morning. Some of the concerns have been wording on the application. We have been telling the Clerks to white out words and add their own, but start issuing."
Denton,3b7x0d,donkeyotee,6,Fri Jun 26 19:20:13 2015 UTC,Ken Paxton has told clerks to hold off too. Because I guess he thinks he's gonna appeal the ruling to god or something.
Denton,3b7x0d,Necoras,2,Fri Jun 26 20:09:39 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised to find out that she didn't even know it was a possibility until the two fellows who walked in there asked for a marriage license.
Denton,3b7x0d,Jarrod,3,Sat Jun 27 01:46:32 2015 UTC,"Of course they do. And they'll make some progress. Expect to see a line of same sex marriage rights restriction laws get passed and then fought over in courts. This will, to some degree, play out similar to how abortion restrictions have in the south. Flat out bans are unconstitutional, but that doesn't mean that people with power are required to make things easy for you. It sucks, but it's predictable."
Denton,3b7x0d,mayorjimmy,2,Fri Jun 26 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"These are what those ""gov employee religious objection"" bills getting passed by the states a few months ago are all about. They were preparing for this, and hoped to get laws passed in an attempt to allow clerks to object to issuing gay marriage licenses and make the process harder for a few months or years. When nearly all county clerks are republicans, they can hope to prevent nearly 90% of gay marriage licenses being issued."
Denton,3b7x0d,hardman52,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:10:19 2015 UTC,"i'm pretty sure they do.  not saying their right, but you only have to look at stuff like gun rights, death penalty, marijuana, and abortion to see that the line between state and federal laws isn't clear-cut.  sometimes the feds can tell states how to run their business and sometimes it's left to (for the better and worse) the states to decide for themselves.  guns and abortion are an example of it being left to the states to decide.  this isn't over by a long shot in Texas.  the religious right will go down kicking and screaming."

Denton,3b7x0d,DrIcePhD,19,Fri Jun 26 18:13:41 2015 UTC,"That's not really how the relationship between federal and state law works in a federated system of government. In this case, Denton County should be handing out the new marriage licenses, but only because the Supreme Court ruled marriage as a constitutional right which therefore supersedes any state law."

Denton,3b7x0d,Irishjavaa,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:20:05 2015 UTC,It's not inconsistent. Gary marriage is a constitutional issue. Weed isn't.

Denton,3b7x0d,Necoras,2,Sat Jun 27 00:07:19 2015 UTC,Crazy. I was there on Tuesday to get my own marriage license.
Denton,3b7x0d,Ks50on,2,Fri Jun 26 20:21:02 2015 UTC,"So, technically the Supreme Court ruling doesn't take effect immediately. There's plenty of bureaucratic red tape to wade through before local institutions are forced to begin acting in concert with the ruling. That said, actions like Ms Luke's are just delaying tactics at this point. They can throw fits if they want, pass restriction bills ala the abortion ones we've seen, but barring a constitutional amendment, they've lost this fight."

Denton,3b7x0d,Aeschylus-,11,Fri Jun 26 20:36:42 2015 UTC,It's about the state following the constitution. The courts are deciding that the 14th amendment protects gay rights and thus they should be allowed to marry. This office is determining that they are going to oppose the constitution.

Denton,3b7vnr,invaluableimp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:45:57 2015 UTC,I love the analogy haha. The best I got is Denton County roads have more holes than swiss cheese. I feel like Interstate 35-E is especially bad. Remember when there was a huge hole in the bridge by the hospital? I feel like driving on a dirt road is better for my car.
Denton,3b7vnr,donkeyotee,4,Tue Jun 30 12:39:25 2015 UTC,The roads in Denton are terrible. Most of the roads are worse than if they were just paved with gravel.  You couldn't tell that 5% of every tax dollar goes to the roads. Meanwhile the 300 feet from Teasly that the city manager has to drive to get home was just completely redone to the point being completely stripped out to the dirt below and replaced with concrete while major roads get a bag of cheap asphalt to patch the old patches that have failed again. Shady Oaks between 288 and Colorado just got new blacktop and hardly anyone even uses that stretch of road.
Denton,3b7vnr,eastsidedreamin,4,Fri Jun 26 20:54:35 2015 UTC,"Denton has the worst road system I've seen. Not only pot holes, etc. But also uneven lanes, narrow streets, arbitrary turn only lanes, etc."
Denton,3b7vnr,LGKyrros,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:11:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I feel like drainage is particularly bad.  Even after the awesome rebuild of Hickory Street downtown it's a river when it rains."

I think the management company itself has changed 2-3 times since I've lived here in a year.

Lots of problems with roaches, 'updated' floors, fixtures, etc were all done via a terrible contractor, floors counter tops etc are all horrible quality materials. Piss poor work at best.   Pros: Free electricity. A/Cs work well enough for being ~20 years old. Our apartment came with a new fridge and stove, but only because the other ones were INFESTED with roaches.   Dumpsters constantly fill up and overflow, management doesn't give a shit. Broken bottles and trash everywhere because it's the ghetto and your neighbors are low-income dickheads who don't care about anyone but themselves.  Maintenance is the only saving grace here.

I heard the strike and heard a pop from my entertainment center that fried my HDMI 1 port on my TV and scared the fuck out of me. Then heard a lot of people talking, followed by sirens that stopped here and a bunch of people were coming outside, so I went to check it out and the chimney thing on building 2 was in flames, smoke pouring out of the roof and firefighters started hitting it with the hoses. Crazy, scary stuff.  Internet's been down since the strike, too, dunno if that's for everyone or if it screwed up my modem, though."
Denton,3ambep,Necromorphiliac,3,Sun Jun 21 17:31:13 2015 UTC,Yea I work at the DG right across  and it was a huge pop that rang in my ears for like 15 min. Very bright blue flash as well. A lot or smoke was coming out of the top of it and they punched a hole on the street side of the roof to help smoke escape   Never seen lightning that close to me strike tho. I was about 250 yards away from it
Denton,3ambep,ninjamike808,2,Sun Jun 21 18:03:37 2015 UTC,Apparently a buddy of mine lives in that building. He said their side is ok and he didn't think anyone was hurt. Fires been out for a few hours now.
Denton,3ambep,Daxzus,2,Sun Jun 21 21:48:37 2015 UTC,"I was getting ready to leave to when I heard all the noise and thought it was thunder, live across the street and watched all the fire trucks.

I literally thought it was spinning out of control and about crash when I first saw it.  There was a lot of smoke too, but I guess all stunt planes are like that?"
Denton,3afz9p,bestycoasty_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's a common thing. The smoke is meant to make them more visible and a lot of stunt planes do flips and stuff in the air that you wouldn't expect an airplane to ever be able to do but they still have control of the aircraft."

Its really a shame that money overruled the community's vote. To me, that symbolizes everything that is wrong with our government."
Denton,3a22ms,idontknowhow2reddit,13,Tue Jun 16 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"What's interesting to me is that the idea of small government is quite common in Texas, yet here we are with no choice but to accept that the big boys have all the power even though we've already expressed our grievances and come to a decision as a community."
Denton,3a22ms,nc08bro,-12,Tue Jun 16 19:56:47 2015 UTC,"Ironic that all the 'hippies' are ""pro local control"" only on this fracking case, but are all pro-centralized-government on every other policy issue."
Denton,3a22ms,YoMama6666,5,Tue Jun 16 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not very informed on these topics, I really just wanted to start a discussion that could help myself and others. Can you point me to any examples of this?"
Denton,3a22ms,nc08bro,-8,Tue Jun 16 21:41:05 2015 UTC,"Certainly:  the fracking thing, where ""free-thinking"" Dentonites are outraged the State has seen fit to exert centralized control, yet these same folks are quite often in favor of centralized authority, like the forced imposition of Common Core, a public school curriculum that obviously doesn't fit each community's needs."
Denton,3a22ms,YoMama6666,11,Tue Jun 16 22:09:42 2015 UTC,"I think Common Core is a bad example. The people I know that are against Common Core are pretty varied in their political beliefs. In fact, most of my anti-fracking friends in Denton are against it."
Denton,3a22ms,Brenzle,-7,Tue Jun 16 22:42:18 2015 UTC,"It's a bad idea, which is why a variety of people are against it.  But the point is:  it's being forced by a faceless, distant centralized government that doesn't care what's going on locally, or what the local citizenry have to say.  The example is entirely relevant.  You can't have it both ways ideologically."
Denton,3a22ms,YoMama6666,2,Tue Jun 16 22:55:41 2015 UTC,1) It isn't being forced by the federal government.  2) Did you have a problem with No Child Left Behind? Because that was pushed by the federal government....
Denton,3a22ms,eagle_shadow,-2,Wed Jun 17 03:06:59 2015 UTC,"It's not forced if your community has no interest in receiving federal education funding.  That's called ""coercion"".  But that doesn't bother you, eh?"
Denton,3a22ms,YoMama6666,2,Wed Jun 17 04:45:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for some new reading material! I hadn't heard of Common Core
Denton,3a22ms,nc08bro,2,Tue Jun 16 22:31:47 2015 UTC,Common core isn't a curriculum. Just FYI
Denton,3a22ms,Maynguene_banana,3,Wed Jun 17 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, you are an idiot.   First off, there is no such thing as a forced imposition of Common Core. It is an option that should be made available to teachers in order to teach their students in a way that helps the students best. It was an option. Nothing more; nothing less. Teachers would have still been allowed to teach their students as they see fit. Why anybody in their right mind would take a method of teaching away from teachers is beyond me, but whatever.   Secondly, before Common Core was even taught here, it was outlawed by the state because President Obama put his support behind it. It was a state initiative and never a federal one. However, because a democratic president supported something, the fear mongering started here and laws were passed against it in order to prevent a ""federal take over of education"". Nobody seemed to have a problem with No Child Left Behind, but that was pushed by a republican.....  The problem with this law is simple. Abbott has constantly sued the federal government claiming that they are over-reaching their authority with respect to local governments, and then he does the exact same fucking thing to Denton."

I won't post how my nose is being hit since I'm sure you've heard all the examples by now, and gas company scientist vs regular scientist still don't agree."
Denton,3a22ms,DentonNomNoms,3,Tue Jun 16 20:49:34 2015 UTC,I was under the impression you could have chickens. are there stipulations?
Denton,3a22ms,digplants,3,Wed Jun 17 00:57:22 2015 UTC,There are codes you have to follow making it infeasible in some situations.
Denton,3a22ms,wholemilkisjustvomit,2,Wed Jun 17 02:31:27 2015 UTC,That sounds reasonable. Unfortunate for those who really want chickens but I understand certain rules being in place.

Denton,3a22ms,DentonNomNoms,4,Wed Jun 17 15:30:42 2015 UTC,I can agree with this. I think you can compare the fracking ban to not allowing smoking in bars. It should be a decision made by the property owner. One argument though is that fracking on one's property may directly affect the properties around them.
Denton,3a22ms,nc08bro,2,Tue Jun 16 19:54:30 2015 UTC,"DRAINAGE! DRAINAGE, ELI, YOU BOY"
Denton,3a22ms,ajm__,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:34:04 2015 UTC,"That is spot on. This is not an argument to take property rights from others.   But just as with smoking (an issue I am still on the fence about as a non-smoker) fracking can affect other people who do not own the property.   One might argue, well they don't have to shop/live there. No they don't. but it is much harder to move your life to a new residence than it is to not go a certain bar.   Also, these wells just aren't near houses, but schools as well!"
Denton,3a22ms,Bongfu,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:56:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for contributing! As a smoker I want everywhere to allow smoking! Haha! But I don't like making people feel uncomfortable so I don't mind stepping a few feet away if we're outside or just stepping outside for a moment. But this 30' rule seems a bit ridiculous to me. Especially when the owners of such businesses want to allow smoking but are soon to be forced to move on.
Denton,3a22ms,nc08bro,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:07:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I think the better solution would be to maybe ban it in restaurants but leave bars alone. My biggest worry is then banning things like the hookah lounges which keep friends of mine in business.
Denton,3a22ms,Bongfu,4,Wed Jun 17 23:39:50 2015 UTC,City Council is getting ready to discuss this tonight. Watch it here: dTV
Denton,3a22ms,ItsBlahBlah,0,Wed Jun 17 00:31:20 2015 UTC,What a fucking embarrassment. I'm embarrassed this city has no backbone to stand behind its own laws to fight an un-constitutional ordinance. How sad.
Denton,3a22ms,2slow2curious,11,Wed Jun 17 08:29:12 2015 UTC,"No.  You've been looking at this at a micro level.  The repeal vote got rid of a distraction that divided us.  If you watched the dynamics of what happened last night, this community just built solidarity at the local level.  Use it.  Everyone in that council chamber last night, regardless of their prior political views, environmental views, or views on mineral exploration hates what the state did to us, and expressed anger and outrage towards the state.  Use it.  The local ban served a valuable purpose, but that purpose is done.  This is just Stage 1 of a movement.  The ban was never a realistic long term solution.  It was symbolic, and it was an incredibly powerful symbol.   It's still a powerful symbol that galvanized the beginning stage of a movement, but it's time to move on to the next stage.  Leave the petty bickering at the local level behind.  That's not the problem.  Focus your outrage at the state, where it belongs.  We cannot be allies at the state level if we are still snarling and bickering at the local level over an ordinance that never had any real ""teeth"" to start with.  Open your mind and broaden your focus.  Don't sabotage the movement with recklessness.  The next stage will require finesse, and you may not always understand what's going on.  Follow the leaders who do, and hang on.  The odds are still against us, as always, and it will take a very, very long time, but we have to pull together.  What just happened is anything but an embarrassment.  Stop to appreciate the fact that we are located in one of the most politically conservative counties, in one of the most politically conservative states in the nation.  This is a state that was built on mineral exploration, and many of the people here make money off of those minerals.  And yet, look at all of the things we have accomplished that many said were impossible.  Against this backdrop, stop to appreciate the initiative vote and the media attention.  Stop to appreciate the fact that in the preamble to the repeal ordinance, the city council expressed solidarity against what the state did to us, and voted 6-1 in favor of that sentiment, with the one vote dissenting only because she didn't think it went far enough. Stop to appreciate that this town has gotten far more than 15 minutes of fame, and not just fame at the Denton Record-Chronicle, but at the state, national, and even global level.  This movement has been reported by the BBC, Al-Jazeera, RT, and just about all major media outlets at the national level.  At a global level, Denton is probably better known for this than it is for the One O'Clock Lab Band.  No, this is far from a ""fucking embarrassment"".  It's our proudest moment.  I've never been more proud to live in Denton."
Denton,3a22ms,attackingfracking,3,Wed Jun 17 12:58:28 2015 UTC,"How is it unconstitutional?  I support Denton's fracking ban, and I really don't like the stunt the state pulled, but I don't see what makes it unconstitutional."
Denton,3a22ms,HAHA_goats,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:21:35 2015 UTC,"With good reason, namely that it is not unconstitutional. The Texas legislature and the TRC have authority over gas and oil production in Texas. Denton has no authority to ban fracking in their jurisdiction because all power rests with the states unless otherwise delegated. That being said, it was an awesome stand and I support the notion."

Denton,3a4m8s,trottelchampion,10,Wed Jun 17 04:44:31 2015 UTC,"The UNT Psychology clinic in Terrill Hall is an excellent community resource.  You do not need to be a student as it is a teaching program available to anyone who can get themselves there.  It is open daily during the semesters, sometimes as late as 7-8 pm to accommodate people's lives.   Fees are based on a sliding scale, there is an intake interview and after that a few sessions dedicated to understanding the problems and their ability to help, much of it is survey style paperwork.  This is a necessity not a problem.  If it seems that scheduling regular therapy will be beneficial they are good about contacting and setting it up.  Since it is a teaching program grad students at the end of their masters or during their PhDs are the ones who conduct the therapy.  The student therapist is overseen by licensed, professional psychologists and the cases are closely monitored.   Tell them to call this # (940) 565-2631"
Denton,3a4m8s,Beautiful_Sound,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:48:33 2015 UTC,"That's definitely an awesome resource.  At the lowest income bracket, your friend could be looking at as little as $12/hour.  During the school year, the clinic is open from 10am - 8pm (M-Th), and 10am - 5pm on Fridays.  However, I would definitely advise your friend not to stop at the clinic when seeking resources.  The waiting list for therapy can be several weeks.  The waiting list for assessment can run up to several months.  But regardless, give them a call.  If there's a waitlist, you can get on it while you look around elsewhere.  It's a fantastic resource overall, though!"

Don't force them to go to a therapist if they don't want to.  It's not for everyone.  Idk what is around here in Denton. I think Noble (my Dr here in Denton)  offers some type of help.  My Dr said if I ever wanted to get back on meds to just tell her and she could give me a percription for them.  It cost 45 there for me as well. meds can cost form 5-hundreds of dollars.  But you can see if noble does have therapist or not.  If ur friends need someone to talk to me and my bf both have anxiety and depression and know what they are going though.

Denton,39o630,digplants,-9,Sat Jun 13 11:18:03 2015 UTC,"They're completely renovating the entire property, and making it an actual comfortable, desirable place to live. Hardwood floors, new leather furniture, flatscreens in the living room, new carpet, fixtures, paint. They're also giving written advanced notice before any work is done. This guy is probably butthurt because he left stuff on his walls and near his baseboards when he was told to move it for the painters, and instead they moved it for him.  Grow up, kid."
Denton,39o630,TonyFuckingDanza,3,Sat Jun 13 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"Right, because they have such a good reputation here already. Jesus, jackass, give the guy a break. It sounds like more of the same typical bullshit from these guys. Property management companies in this town are all too willing to fuck around students, because they're naive and most don't realize that it's unacceptable, borderline illegal behavior."
Denton,39o630,wtfburritoo,-6,Sat Jun 13 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"That post you linked to is someone's mother (starting to see a pattern here?) who is butthurt about the exact same thing! When they put in new floors and carpeting in my apartment, they moved my things into the bathroom and the living room. And I appreciated their efforts because I have new carpets and new floors. I didn't cry to my mommy because they touched my precious belongings or bitch about it on reddit like a twelve year old."

Denton,39o630,Handupmanup,3,Sat Jun 13 18:06:47 2015 UTC,"There's probably a middle ground truth here between the property management company being the devil and the tenant being a child.    For example, written notice at the unit itself doesn't help for the many students that leave during the summer. Conversely, the OP should have asked some questions after the first or second instance to try and resolve the miscommunication."

Denton,39mcbj,atexanjournalist,7,Fri Jun 12 19:18:12 2015 UTC,"That is just splitting the most ridiculous of hairs.  I don't see how any accomplishment made by a student's use of school equipment has anything to do with the school.    When two of my band friends won music scholarships, I don't remember the school confiscating them because they had to use school-owned instruments.  That was earned profit as well, am I missing some philosophical difference between awarded or purchased? (Something tells me I am, but I just don't see it as that big of a difference) Either way the kid earns a profit.   *errant apostrophe"
Denton,39mcbj,Beautiful_Sound,2,Fri Jun 12 19:41:29 2015 UTC,"Scholarships are a great point I haven't seen anyone else bring up. I think the difference is that... oh wait,  I don't see the difference. In fact, when I was a master's student at UNT, they encouraged us to sell our work if we could."
Denton,39mcbj,Beautiful_Sound,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:59:14 2015 UTC,If the kid used his own data storage device in the camera and perhaps his own photo printer would this be an issue?
Denton,39mcbj,Silverjackel,2,Fri Jun 12 20:39:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'll be able to finagle that,  bc then ppl can just say ""well he used the schools lens etc"" or whichever is the part of the camera that effects quality of Image the most.   No I think instead of drawing some stupid arbitrary line the answer just needs to be a simple yes.  No fine print just yes.  if a student created something from nothing and  someone wants to buy it,  it should have 0 to do with the school regardless of equipment, campus time,  instructor helping on a project, etc.   One last example,  How many people do you think have used excerpts from a book they were working on for a report,  or based a book off a assignment given by the school that was then published and made them a bunch of money.  I'de be willing to bet more than a few.   Sorry for rambling but alot of stuff came to mind as to why this is the most rediculous fucking question being posed.   I mean it's like if the college tried to come after part of my paycheck from my internship saying hey we landed you this gig, pay up.   Edit.   That comment was under the assumption this was a college deal,  and working on a private project.  After having actually read the thing now I'm thinking in this case it's actually not OK,  bc he was taking pictures of a school sports event.   At my High-school there was a photography section in the booster clubs website that you or parents could order the professional shots from field level,  and since he was producing pro-quality shots maybe they are worried about losing money for booster events."
Denton,39mcbj,Beautiful_Sound,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:00:52 2015 UTC,"As to your edit: That's why my second comment introduced the 'if' it was majority his equipment, even if the camera was the school's."
Denton,39mcbj,Silverjackel,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:44:58 2015 UTC,"Yah my edit should have addressed that right?  I'm saying that the content of the pictures is what should matter  since it was a school event, they may be selling their own pictures of the athletes of the same quality,  which I feel would be enough reason to make him stop.  However,  based on the article they didn't even mention this, they just claimed rights due to the property which from my initial post I disagree with wholly.   I wasn't saying your question was bad but the original one the article was about."
Denton,39mcbj,Beautiful_Sound,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:57:17 2015 UTC,I can't believe one decent student photographer is that much of a threat.    Edit:  WHAT AM I SAYING!  The problem is the ironic twist this puts on all student work.  Are the kids free contract labor working for the massa or are they individuals with goals that lay outside of 'free' education?
Denton,39mcbj,Silverjackel,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:00:48 2015 UTC,"Well if that's what you're saying, I'm not sure why you're saying it, because it's irrelevant.  This puts no twist on ""all""  student work. This is a single case, one case does not set a global precedent,  and this case Imparticular for sure doesn't,  because the student was photographing a school event. Which the school has a right to permit or deny,  the fact that they chose the wrong reason for denying it is a major point,  but it doesn't negate mine.   If someone was taking pictures of me while I was walking around and calling it art and selling it and I found out,  I would be within my legal rights to sue bc they used my image for profit without my express consent.   Show me an engineering student not allowed to sell his senior design project to a company when he graduates and I'll agree it's bullshit but you can't compare that to selling snapshots of a football game and being told to stop."
Denton,39mcbj,jordorb,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:13:48 2015 UTC,That's a good thought.  A camera isn't any good if you can't save the pictures or if you don't have a lens. What if he used his own camera but a school lens? What if he sold pictures used with school equipment of nature or something that wasn't a school function or used in a school publication.  There are a lot of questions to consider.
Denton,39mcbj,Schoffleine,7,Sat Jun 13 19:10:24 2015 UTC,"I can see both sides. My fiancé was in the engineering department and for their senior project they used the school's 3D printers, and other machines that made the project possible. So I understand that the school wants to own these projects. What I don't understand is that these people came up with this project design, built it themselves, and 100% of the work was theirs. So I don't think that should be taken away from them."
Denton,39mcbj,jordorb,2,Sat Jun 13 00:28:27 2015 UTC,"If the school comes up with the project on their own, then great.  If not, they can fuck off.  If you bring a prototype concept to a shop to get it built, the shop doesn't automatically own your concept.  This isn't really any different."
Denton,39mcbj,verdantmiles,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:11:45 2015 UTC,"No I completely get it. It's not their idea, work, or design. But students are using their very expensive technical equipment. I think it would be generous to credit the school for that. Not own the whole thing."

Denton,39mcbj,Shopno,7,Sat Jun 13 14:42:16 2015 UTC,"Well, sure. If someone writes a novel on a school computer, no one's going to tell them they can't publish it and make money from it. If someone does an illustration on a school computer, they can still sell prints of it. If someone uses the school's turntable and kiln to make a clay vase, they can still sell the vase.  I honestly can't see how this is an issue at all. If he's given permission to use the equipment, what does it matter whether he uses it for personal use? Unless he signed a contract saying he wouldn't use it for personal use, there's literally no issue here and they're causing a fuss over nothing."

Denton,39byn7,DentonParks,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Those are UNT's ponds, so you would probably want to contact someone there. I can't help with those unfortunately.   You can fish at other ponds around Denton. We stock the South Lakes pond every two weeks. You can see more here."

Denton,392mzb,DuderComputer,3,Wed Jun 10 04:11:59 2015 UTC,What I want to know is if anyone can verify the safety of the baristas and other customers at the shop? I'm worried that the guy did things that led up to police being called.
Denton,392mzb,PrintUnderPressure,7,Mon Jun 8 21:44:07 2015 UTC,"From JuHo Facebook page We would like to address the incident involving police that occurred this afternoon at Jupiter House. This morning we got a phone call from one of our baristas saying she was having a difficult time dealing with a customer who was displaying odd, aggressive, and antagonizing behavior towards our staff and other patrons. We got a description of the individual and realized it was someone we have had multiple issues with going on 2 years. We called the Denton Police Department to issue a No Trespass on this individual so we could go about our business. The police showed up within minutes of our call and located the individual across the street and issued him a no trespass. It was at this time we found out he had an extensive history with the police department and other local businesses. Even after the no trespass was issued, he still tried to come in the shop. We thought the issue had been resolved... This afternoon around 2pm, the individual who was no trespassed got into verbal altercations with customers out front. He became very angry so the police were called again. They showed up again in minutes and verbally tried to get the individual to leave. From what we understand, the police tried to apprehend him outside and he got away and began banging his head on the front glass door. The door was shattered. He also slammed his head into the big plate glass window. He then opened the front door and started walking towards the counter with officers following him telling him to stop or they were forced to taze him. He resisted the officers attempts and was taken down at the front counter.  We are proud of the Denton Police Department, our Baristas, and our loyal customers who were present and helped during the incident.  Tomorrow is a new day and we hope to see everyone soon!"
Denton,392mzb,darrenhundt,5,Tue Jun 9 05:07:14 2015 UTC,"A cop came inside to escort the man out of the coffee shop (I think he's been told not to return to Jupiter House before) and while the officer and the man were outside, things got out of hand when the guy tried to get up and go back inside. He then started resisting/fighting with the officer. In doing so, he slammed his head into the side window (gashing his head), and then again into the door (which cracked the glass).  The officer was unable to detain him and so called for backup. When an additional officer arrived, the man was tased (which, as you can see, did very little) after they had a hard time prying him away from the door handle, and the video picks up shortly after as he forcefully enters back into the shop. The guy was clearly suffering from a mental disability or, as OP said, some sort of narcotic. He ended up getting handcuffed, put on a stretcher and taken in to get stitches/arrested. When I first got there, he was sitting outside looking pretty calm and happy, but obviously a little loony."
Denton,392mzb,Master_Ghudda,2,Mon Jun 8 23:34:01 2015 UTC,"I was there (one of the people running to the back in the video), and from what I can tell, nobody else got hurt.  I hear that the guy being detained knocked his head and bled quite a bit, though I was already in the alley by that time."

When him and the officer started fighting, he was also claiming that the cop was ""raping him in the ass"". Also worth noting that at one point, the suspect stated he was schizophrenic. Not sure if that's actually true, but he did claim it."
Denton,392mzb,Master_Ghudda,4,Mon Jun 8 23:40:19 2015 UTC,Yeesh.   I was a little worried that it was bystanders saying that.
Denton,392mzb,MaverickTTT,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:59:37 2015 UTC,"It seems like it was someone else.  The bystander's comments were pretty disturbing though.

Denton,393j6b,gumboshrimps,9,Tue Jun 9 20:35:47 2015 UTC,Legit seafood. I'm from the west coast and would love to have well sourced fish and shrimp.
Denton,393j6b,pillowlips,2,Tue Jun 9 02:49:53 2015 UTC,Have you tried hoochies on the square? I'm not a huge fan of the new menu but If they still follow the same business model then their fish is shipped in fresh from the coast daily I think.
Denton,393j6b,gumboshrimps,2,Tue Jun 9 04:39:16 2015 UTC,"I did a long time ago at their old location.  Would prefer a nicer establishment than an oyster bar.  Although to be fair I haven't been inside the new location.  I figured someone would bring up hoochies so I'll add that when I am looking for seafood I wanna see the tunas, halibut, grouper, pacific fish, etc."
Denton,393j6b,velvetbox,2,Tue Jun 9 04:41:46 2015 UTC,"Would prefer a nicer establishment   Hoochie's new place is a great little restaurant.  Good planning and great management.  I eat there all the time and the owners are very friendly and accommodating. I always tell people from out of town if they are on the square to eat there.  If you want tuna, halibut, etc...just make a suggestion and I am sure they will consider it if enough people ask for it.  But only a few requests aren't enough to change a menu best suited for revelers and not the usual epicurean.  Has to make money consistently to add to the menu I would think."

Denton,393j6b,lbradleyiii,17,Tue Jun 9 06:45:00 2015 UTC,"OP, if you do decide to do something cool, please don't half-ass it.  We keep hearing that Denton won't support anything that's not mainstream and safe.  The truth is, throughout Denton's history, people have tried, but very few are willing to really invest the capital to do it right, so its ultimate failure becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.    But there are exceptions, for example:  Beth Marie's ice cream, Viet Bites, Ravelin Bakery, Keichi.  All of these are home grown, and any of them could stand proudly against competitors anywhere else in the Metroplex.  From what I can tell, each started with someone who REALLY KNEW how to make an outstanding product.  Not just good, but outstanding.  They beat the odds, not because of atmosphere or marketing, but because the product came first.  OP, much as I appreciate your willingness to do something cool, it sounds to me like you are doing it backwards, and asking, ""what should I do?""  No!  Bullshit!  It will fail, and it will perpetuate the myth that Denton won't support something cool.  We aren't unsophisticated.  With two universities, we have highly educated people, and people drawn here from all over.  We know what good is.  If it opens here and it's not good (e.g., Gerhard's), we'll blow it off and drive somewhere else for the real thing - plenty of options nearby.  So, please - what style we want here is irrelevant.  It isn't about distance, or whether it's in the city limits.  We will drive to get the good stuff, and others will drive here.  ""Good enough"" never is.  Do something outstanding that would succeed in Dallas, or Frisco, or Flower Mound, but put it here.  We'll find it (and so will they)."
Denton,393j6b,Lieroo,3,Tue Jun 9 12:17:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Another thing that makes Denton tough is that restaurants get hit hard during summer. It's far slower and a business that was just making it by during the school season, may not clear summer. There's some good places that have a tough time getting business during the slow months."
Denton,393j6b,schmutzz,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:58:54 2015 UTC,"I like this take on it.  OP, tell us what your people are good at and we will tell you if it will fly here.  To answer the question - pho, Moroccan, tapas; although the first two would make bizarre bars."
Denton,393j6b,Euphorinaut,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:03:26 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate all this! Great thoughts here to take into consideration. Denton is home to some awesome local places that could (and do) indeed stand against competitors all around DFW. The reason I would like to get some insight into what is wanted in Denton is because at this point, we don't have chefs set in stone, so whenever we do decide a general style of food we will be looking for cooks who can deliver on that. We're not necessarily building the place around the food and drinks, but even so I would still like to have fantastic items that will bring people in on their own.  I might as well give y'all a little more insight into the theme of the place too. It is going to be an eSports bar, essentially having gaming computers and consoles available to play, gaming events and tournaments, etc, along with the food and drink offerings. So it will be a somewhat casual environment, but I don't want to simply offer the typical bar food. So I'm thinking some great food that's easy to eat while doing other activities like playing video games, tabletops, and board/card games. The gaming will be the main focus of the business, but like I said I would still like to offer awesome food and drinks and not just have the gaming be the only focus of the establishment. Hope that helps give a little more insight into my thinking for this!"

Like with real sherry, and everything (I'm not kidding you, I once went to a tapas place in Bricktown - OKC - and they did not serve sherry).  Should have awesome and exotic appetizers into the late evening, with a variety of sherries (Fino, Amontillado, Oloroso, PX) from different soleras, and maybe some port.  They could really play it up with style.  Perhaps you could offer a few options of imported beers and traditional wines also.  Ideally, it would be around downtown and the campus, and be a place where you could bring a date, or impress out-of-towners, and I think that the hipsters would get into it too.  Maybe some flamenco guitar.  You could call it Andalusia.  Off hand, I'm not aware of any place in the metroplex like this, so it might be some place where we wouldn't have to hear that it's ""not as good as Frisco, McKinney, Plano, etc.""."

Furthermore, while they did refund us, they did not even offer to have another SoHo stylist fix her hair. This was her first time having her hair colored at a salon and it was a horrible experience.

Prohibited animal does not mean a psittacine bird, canary, finch, hamster, guinea pig, rat, mouse, gerbil, or reptile families Leptotyphlopidae and Colubridae.

Denton,38m8qf,michaelien,2,Fri Jun 5 03:10:55 2015 UTC,"If you're water bill skyrocketed, you may have a leak. Also it's summer and you'll probably be using more water. They base their water prices on how much you use during winter so if you used more this past winter than the price will increase. At least I think that's how it works. Good luck finding answers."
Denton,38m8qf,digplants,2,Fri Jun 5 08:16:30 2015 UTC,They calculate the drainage fee based on how much you use in the Winter months since you are most likely not watering your lawn.  Probably a water leak. A dripping faucet can increase $10 easily.
Denton,38m8qf,kerry63,2,Fri Jun 5 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Happened to me last month. Check your meter - my bill was showing a much higher number than my meter. I called and they sent someone to re-read the meter and do a leak check, but it took over a week and they still seemed to be reading the meter wrong and no amount of logic would convince them otherwise.  This month my water bill is about 1/3 of average (I know I used more than 1300 gallons) so it seems to have evened out.  But be sure and check for a leak too."
Denton,38m8qf,jtx84,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:58:09 2015 UTC,Definitely this. Mine more than doubled and showed we used 4x the amount of water. Turns out that the water got into the meter and messed up the electronics inside they did manual reading and corrected our bill.
Denton,38m8qf,Whatajabroni,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:53:27 2015 UTC,"No, but in past experience it has been a leak. You can also request they re-read the meter just to double check."

Denton,38gwvg,YoMama6666,2,Thu Jun 4 03:51:04 2015 UTC,I'm currently using Tessa doiel. She's really friendly and helpful. I actually asked the same question a few months ago. Now for some advice.  I've been looking for a house for a few months and the market is crazy. If you have a ton of money or are looking past 150k you'll probably be fine but if you're under 150k be ready for competition and basically accepting whatever the seller wants. It's rough. Tessa has been very available despite my crazy schedule and has really helped me and my wife learn the ropes of house buying. Denton is a sellers market and I was like you and I've been slowly looking further and further away from my preferred area. Good luck! I hate to have more competition but I like the people in this sub for the most part.   Let me know if you want more info like contacts. You can find it on google.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Denton/comments/2rcav0/anyone_know_a_realtor_who_isnt_evil_or_fond_of/  This was my post and the suggestions from a few months ago.

I could pass mouth germs from my mouth to my fingers. Then I get an order to make, and I forget (or heaven forbid, choose) to not wash my hands.

Denton,385df0,notacllerro,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"Abus Buffo u-locks are close to impossible to get through with any typical method of bike thievery. Way easier to carry than kryptonite locks, too. Here's a link http://www.abus.com/us/Recreational-Security/Bike-Safety-and-Security/Locks"
Denton,385df0,Lieroo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:25:39 2015 UTC,Combining an adequate U-Lock with a cable lock for the wheels should serve as plenty of deterrent for thieves to look elsewhere.  I haven't had a bicycle theft incident in Denton and I leave my lights and computer on my handlebars all the time.
Denton,381np3,LazyWriterBoy,11,Mon Jun 1 05:11:22 2015 UTC,"I'll try it out soon, can't stand LSA anymore and I refuse to support them. Especially after working there awhile ago."
Denton,381np3,GravityRides,10,Mon Jun 1 06:38:17 2015 UTC,"Their burgers are very over-rated; they have the location and deck going for them, but that is about all. Have been twice because I always give places a second chance (I REALLY wanted to like it!) and was disappointed both times."
Denton,381np3,lonestarjeff,3,Mon Jun 1 08:33:01 2015 UTC,"What was wrong with LSA? Not defending, genuine question."
Denton,381np3,AugustSun,6,Mon Jun 1 07:14:15 2015 UTC,"Management and the executive team are obsessed with success and can't properly reason with staff because it's become more corporate in the last year. You can talk to any former employee their and they'll tell you the exact same thing. It went from a small business feel to a corporate mentality fast over the summer. Employees their aren't valued unless you're one their favorites. You don't make a lot money consistently either. On the consumer side, the burgers are overrated and the atmosphere is obnoxious of loud country/pop music. It's not marketed to the college/younger crowd either, more towards boomers and people with money. Not joking, this is what management has told me personally. It didn't make sense at first, but older people have money and that's where they go to blow it so it makes sense."
Denton,381np3,GravityRides,5,Mon Jun 1 21:33:40 2015 UTC,"the atmosphere is obnoxious of loud country/pop music   This.  When you have to basically shout across the table to have a conversation with the others at your table.    Also, they need to rethink the menu, how food is served, and what it is served on, and a few more things.   I really, really admire the theme, but it seems like management is a bit lacking there."
Denton,381np3,velvetbox,2,Tue Jun 2 06:24:54 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. LSA had a good thing going at first, but management (or at least when Chelle was GM) constantly strong-armed employees into covering shifts outside of their availability and abused consistently loyal, hardworking employees by promising them promotions/raises, but never delivering. As a former employee, I refuse to spend any of my money at LSA because they don't give a single fuck about their employees and they are constantly polluting the Square with shitty, obnoxious pop/country."
Denton,381np3,Panasonicy0uth,2,Tue Jun 2 21:48:27 2015 UTC,"This makes me sad, I really liked LSA... Except I wish they turned down the music a bit.   Also I miss Denton County Burger Co. I know there is another location, it's just harder for me to walk to."
Denton,381np3,Wownobodycares,2,Wed Jun 3 05:05:56 2015 UTC,I found the food underwhelming.
Denton,381np3,MuppetManiac,-2,Mon Jun 1 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"I have been to LSA three different times and every time the food was cold. I thought the first time it was a mix between the place being new and our server sucking, she made a lot of mistakes and the manager tried to pin everything on the food runner. My SO and I have worked in restaurants and we know a food runner isn't responsible for the mistakes being made that night. The second time the food was also cold but we blamed it on it being busy. The third time, nearly a year after they opened, the server was great but the food was cold and the place wasn't that busy."
Denton,381np3,dacat,4,Mon Jun 1 09:06:54 2015 UTC,"Same here. Doesn't seem to matter when we go, the food is always cold. Let's be clear, when I say cold I mean as cold as the metal tray they serve it on. Rusty's has the same problem. For the life of me, I can't figure out how Rusty's stays in business. Taco's always cold."
Denton,381np3,Irishjavaa,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:16:02 2015 UTC,Worst fish taco I've ever eaten.
Denton,381np3,dacat,-5,Mon Jun 1 19:40:34 2015 UTC,I go to rusty often and I've never had bad food. I admit the feta is cold but it isn't the type of cheese you melt.
Denton,381np3,TonyFuckingDanza,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:35:57 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it's bad. It has good flavor. I just would like it to be hotter. :)
Denton,381np3,TonyFuckingDanza,0,Mon Jun 1 14:16:43 2015 UTC,That cheese is called queso fresco.   No one puts feta on tacos.
Denton,381np3,ReferenceError,-8,Mon Jun 1 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah whatever, except plenty of places that put feta on tacos. Like fuzzy just around the corner."
Denton,381np3,TonyFuckingDanza,0,Mon Jun 1 16:32:46 2015 UTC,"Wow you're right. Just looked at their menu. That's just wrong. WTF is Mexican about feta cheese?   Then again, no one ever accused Fuzzy's of being Mexican food."
Denton,381np3,GravityRides,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:27:14 2015 UTC,"Tex Mex is all about the cheese, including feta. Mexican tacos (like sabrocita, estrella, and michoacana) is all about the meat and spices."
Denton,381np3,NinjaShira,-5,Mon Jun 1 17:29:33 2015 UTC,"I dunno Tony, maybe you should stick to Italian food."
Denton,381np3,magXVI,2,Mon Jun 1 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"And Fuzzy's should stop putting Greek cheese on their ""Tex Mex""."
Denton,381np3,BigRigButters,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:37:57 2015 UTC,That sounds about right having the management blaming the runner. I know for a fact that it wouldn't be the runner's fault. We were really good about running food quickly as possible but it might of been the food not being cooked properly. That's just my speculation after working in that god awful place.
Denton,381np3,Kieffers,9,Mon Jun 1 21:42:32 2015 UTC,"Never even heard of it before. My go-to burger is RGs, and it'd take one hell of a burger to top that."
Denton,381np3,jlb0494,4,Mon Jun 1 14:16:28 2015 UTC,"Been in Denton almost 6 years now, and save for a period of like 6 months, RG's has always been my go-to burger. Absolute best."
Denton,381np3,lbradleyiii,16,Mon Jun 1 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe if their manager gets their shit together I'll give it another shot. Last week my girlfriend and I went in around 2 pm and had to wait an hour for our orders. There was a whopping six other people in the lobby/dining room. We were told that there was only one cook in the back and the girl behind the register had to make a phone call for any request we made (refund, cancel order, literally ANYTHING.) I'm not blaming the staff, there were only two of them, but if a manager is getting multiple phone calls about what's going on in the store, they should really make an appearance at minimum.  Sorry for the rant, I'm sure the food is great, but my experience was so unnecessarily terrible I had to put it out there. I'd be more than happy to see them succeed and in turn take some business from LSA, which is overpriced and tastes like paper on a bun."
Denton,381np3,BigRigButters,7,Mon Jun 1 06:58:22 2015 UTC,I got my food in 5-7 minutes with zero problems yesterday. My first time trying the place and was pretty pleased.
Denton,381np3,MaxCorbetti,3,Mon Jun 1 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"have you been to RGs? ive only been there a few times, but each time i went it was damn good."
Denton,381np3,excutio,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:46:33 2015 UTC,RGs is my favorite burger joint by a small margin. Its so good.
Denton,381np3,DuderComputer,0,Tue Jun 2 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"I have, live pretty close by, but usually whenever I plan on going I remember that O'Philly is right next door and change my mind."
Denton,381np3,AbusedKittens,2,Mon Jun 1 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"that's hilarious because I literally have the opposite problem. ""ah man, I really should try O'Philly, but now that I'm here I really wonder what the RG burger of the month is."""
Denton,381np3,DuderComputer,-2,Tue Jun 2 20:04:44 2015 UTC,I'm not a huge fan of working at establishments that fuck up their staffings that bad. Can't even get the guy who makes my burger to show up? That's promising...
Denton,381np3,magXVI,11,Mon Jun 1 13:22:03 2015 UTC,"It's pretty good, nothing can fill the hole Burguesa Burger left in my heart though."
Denton,381np3,RedVelvetCakes,5,Mon Jun 1 07:13:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that place was great. $5 student combo was amazing and their sauce for the French fries was addicting."
Denton,381np3,sonofabee,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:57:26 2015 UTC,I swear I got the shakes for that sauce a week after they closed down.
Denton,381np3,TexasSilverback,2,Tue Jun 2 00:56:22 2015 UTC,I concur. I used to live a block or so away and it was my favorite place to walk to. Miss that place so much. :(
Denton,381np3,__will,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:38:58 2015 UTC,I miss those burgers so hard. And those spicy fries. Oh man.
Denton,381np3,drowse,0,Wed Jun 3 03:08:08 2015 UTC,I didn't like that place at all. The food was mediocre and the name literally translates to Burger Burger.
Denton,381np3,mynameispointless,3,Mon Jun 1 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't know it was open already. I also recommend this place! There was one near my high school, very solid burger."
Denton,381np3,velvetbox,3,Mon Jun 1 07:02:20 2015 UTC,"Since RJ Burger closed down years ago, my favorite burger in Denton without question is RG Burger. I'll check out OC Burger to compare though! Cartwright's on the square is worth having as well."
Denton,381np3,Wownobodycares,2,Mon Jun 1 21:14:20 2015 UTC,This. That was so sad when that dude passed away. Those burgers were amazing.
Denton,381np3,GodspeakerVortka,2,Mon Jun 1 22:11:07 2015 UTC,"I know, right? He was always so friendly too. Great person and amazingly tasty burger. I would love that recipe to live on somewhere. I used to attend Ghetto LAN Party (GLP) frequently back in the day, which took place in the civic center. We would always go get RJ burgers between CS matches. Good times."
Denton,381np3,BlackRoom_Boy,2,Mon Jun 1 23:17:01 2015 UTC,"It is tasty, I ate here a few weeks ago. I recommend!"
Denton,381np3,eastsidedreamin,2,Mon Jun 1 13:26:48 2015 UTC,"Burger Time Machine has always been my favorite burger in town, but I have snagged a few burgers from OC and it has been a very solid burger each time. Their fries are pretty dope as well. It's relatively cheap, good, and I havent had a negative experience yet so I'll definitely keep going"
Denton,381np3,Aimintothedark18,3,Mon Jun 1 18:47:44 2015 UTC,If ever a business needed to hire a cleaning crew.
Denton,381np3,eastsidedreamin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:26:37 2015 UTC,"I really like Burger Time Machine, but I wish they'd do something about their bathroom.... it smells and comes into the dining room."
Denton,381np3,ilikebeer1497,2,Wed Jun 3 05:04:50 2015 UTC,"I had a good experience with OC burger when my girlfriend and I went - very tasty burger and the manager (or owner?) was there and very eager to please.  A couple of my friends have complained about the service being poor the time they went, however, so it seems to be a bit of a crapshoot.  Either way, it was a tasty burger.  Maybe not the best in Denton (RG's), but a damn tasty burger."
Denton,381np3,iheartbrainz,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:31:56 2015 UTC,I'll definitely have to visit. Sounds like a great little place  Edit: paid them a visit today. 10/10. This trumps LSA.

Denton,381np3,Pw285rphil,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:30:41 2015 UTC,You just ask for a cup if I recall correctly. All they have is High Life and Lite.

Denton,381np3,Aimintothedark18,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:51:06 2015 UTC,"Their breakfast was good too!  I've been twice and both times there was no one else there, so our service was quick and the staff was nice."
Denton,381np3,O_Dawn_Piano,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:48:18 2015 UTC,"How about that Casa Galaviz though! LSA very meh, but the atmosphere (deck) sometimes makes up for it. If that place ever closes down, the spot needs to be used for Pop-up restaurant. Or a better burger place. OC is delicious when the order is correct, which for me has been 2/3 of the time."
Denton,381np3,imgeekynotcool,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:48:59 2015 UTC,"You guys are right about the service. Ordered pickup, 2 burgers 1 fry. Waited 15 mins for fries After I already gads my burgers in a bag in hand."
