tfc,3e47q2,Boucher02,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:25 2015 UTC,Given that Kantari seems to be best suited to being a Ligue 2 defender it raises some questions about just how he would do in MLS.  He could be a good signing if he is brought in for a role other than to partner Perquis at CB but if he is the only defensive addition that the club makes this month it should raise a few eye brows   That makes me not entirely happy here.
tfc,3e3aay,Paulie4star,6,Tue Jul 21 17:01:55 2015 UTC,Pretty cool! I hope Giovinco wrecks that crew.

tfc,3e579g,quelar,7,Wed Jul 22 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"I find it kinda ridiculous that people are still defending him. The second he was injured he ran off to England. If he was dedicated to the team he would have stayed here to get healthy in our ""world class facilities"" (his own words).    I gave him lots of leadway at that time but in retrospect i shouldn't have."
tfc,3e579g,ThatCanadianDuude,-3,Wed Jul 22 02:20:48 2015 UTC,"The only reason he left is because just like he said, so many fans criticized him for being injured. He ran off to England because of the way he was treated. When he came back from injury and din't score for a while, our fans got so impatient, of course he wanted to leave."
tfc,3e579g,quelar,5,Wed Jul 22 02:41:13 2015 UTC,"To be fair I don't remember anyone criticizing him for his injury. The problems started when he ran off and we started hearing rumours that he wantef to go back. He then said nothing about it for a long time, far too long and even by then the denial was half hearted.  Either way I thank him for doing that. We wouldn't have the team we do now without his actions and I will always fondly remember those first few games last season where it looked like we finally had a team.  Edit :  And AGAIN guys, PLEASE keep this sub friendly. Don't downvote him because you don't like what he's saying. He has valid concerns here and there's no reason for that."

tfc,3drw4h,Funkehed,8,Sat Jul 18 22:28:16 2015 UTC,I'd give a little credit to Giovinco on this one. His acceleration is just incredible once he senses the ball is loose.

Just need to keep possession more, too many give aways in the midfield.. Which will be fixed once Bradley returns.   Really impressed with Delgado and Osorio going forward. And Morgan was solid again.   Gio and Jozy were fantastic as per usual. Could have had a couple more goals between them if the bounces worked in our favour.   Overall, good home win. 3 pts.

He doesn't need to break a sweat, he plays in the final third of the pitch, doesn't require him to run all over the place. He's a target man for passes and he's always looking to get into space behind the D."

tfc,3ds15d,mostmodest-,5,Sat Jul 18 22:34:14 2015 UTC,I thought our CBs got off to a weak start; leaving PHI attackers unguarded in front of Bendik several times. We could easily have ended up 2 goals down before Delgado's opener.
tfc,3ds15d,Menessy27,2,Sun Jul 19 03:04:38 2015 UTC,Yup. Even 3 down. Philly was all over us early on. Scoring after all their pressure seemed to take the wind out of their sails.  Have to be better next week or it's gonna be LA away all over again.
tfc,3ds15d,mdps,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:44:23 2015 UTC,That's a bit much... the start wasn't great but Bendik didn't have a decent save to make all game
tfc,3ds15d,R00K416,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:35:56 2015 UTC,We can attribute that to the Philly strikers and not to our defence. At least in the first 20 minutes or so.
tfc,3ds15d,Menessy27,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:02 2015 UTC,"Whole squad had their celly game on point today, had to put both in the gfycat goal posts."
tfc,3ds15d,rypiso,2,Sat Jul 18 22:23:01 2015 UTC,It was decent... Performance could be better but we won fairly comfortably. Clean sheet would've been better. Also Bendik displayed speed and intelligence coming off his line to collect that Konopka will never have. Compare that Sapong side netting shot to the penalty Konopka gave away last week.
tfc,3ds15d,Menessy27,2,Sat Jul 18 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"Replace Villa with Sapong, and Bendik's probably giving a penalty in that situation as well."
tfc,3ds15d,rypiso,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:45:32 2015 UTC,"Bendik wasn't even within touching range of Sapong. Instead of dangerously sliding towards the man and taking a big swipe (which is basically asking them to call a penalty) he came out and solely focused on staying square to the shooter and cutting down the angle. Although Villa did dive, if he hadn't it still would have been a penalty because Konopka did slide right through him."
tfc,3ds15d,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:38:10 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you're right. Re-watching the highlight, Sapong's run onto the ball is always away from the goal, and he's looking to round and shoot the entire time. At the least you can't compare the two incidents because Villa ran at Konopka looking for the contact."

tfc,3dn2bd,jztrumpeter,8,Fri Jul 17 16:36:22 2015 UTC,our backup strikers making around 500k combined is ridiculous on its own especially when they'll never start with our 2 DP strikers... I thought Moore took a paycut and he had his pay doubled? get rid of one of them please
tfc,3dn2bd,Menessy27,7,Fri Jul 17 16:54:46 2015 UTC,I would say getting rid of Findley should be our first priority. Moore is at least a serviceable backup.
tfc,3dn2bd,Soldado4lyf,3,Fri Jul 17 17:19:07 2015 UTC,For me the only logic behind bringing in Findley was that they wanted veterans and they hadn't yet brought in anyone else yet so they jumped at the chance. He was actually good vs NYCFC but he makes way too much for what his role actually is/should be. I would be very surprised if someone wanted him at that price though and i'd also be surprised if they traded a respected MLS veteran like that only half a year after picking him up.
tfc,3dn2bd,Menessy27,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:39:46 2015 UTC,"That money could be better spent on a starting CB, and a serviceable F. Another Perquis like talent could be had for 350K. The remaining 140K can be used for a backup striker."
tfc,3dn2bd,Vordermark,2,Fri Jul 17 20:18:04 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the Caldwell money opened up enough for us to sign a quality CB in this window. Even if it's only half his salary off the books at 200k, i'd assume we still have some cap space and/or allocation left to add onto that and he would free up an international spot as well. If we have to get rid of someone like Dike as well on top of that i'd be fine with it  Jackson is an interesting case as well because IMO he plays his role well and he brings versatility but he doesnt fit into our formation and i'm not sure they want to pay 200k for a guy who will pretty much only be used as a late sub"

My parents moved up from the East Coast in 2013, and I have tried to visit once or twice a year since they did. This is the first time I've visited since all the construction on Queen's Quay was completed, and I have to say, I loved it. The bike bath was awesome, and my girlfriend and I biked from downtown to the Beaches. Also used the trolleys a ton, which may not seem like anything, but public transit is essentially non-existent in St. John's. Had a ton of great food, and the weather was fantastic as well. Only downside was that during the Gold Cup game, Canada didn't advance. But hey, it was still a blast, and a nice guy in front of me let me borrow his jacket when it was raining.  I love visiting you city. I hope to live there some day. This was probably my best trip yet though. I hope you guys appreciate the investment in your infrastructure because it makes a world of difference. Really makes Toronto great.  Thanks for being such spectacular hosts!"

Never thought it was possible outside of Nascar but apparently it is. The first car was on a surface street and couldn't have been going more than 40kmph but still ended up on its roof, I bolted out of my car to help and thankfully the woman was mostly alright but man it was insane.  The second car was on the highway, I was in the collectors though so I wasn't able to stop and help.  Crazy fucking day, that was."

My dad was a huge Celtic supporter, and so is my step dad.  So it seems fitting to follow them when I can.  Hard to watch their games as the streams are a lot shittier.     Lately I've been trying to get into the MLS more other than TFC. I got my GF to pick a team, and I picked one.  So we try watch RBNY and Houston games. Then I asked in /r/mls if anyone wants to switch teams for a week or two.  So I've watched the last few Columbus games.  To try get to know the players more in general in MLS.   I'll stop when we play them next week and try find a different team. But it's fun if you have MLSLive.  I watched the Columbus game then had a discussion with the guy after.  He does it with TFC players.     Said he likes Delgado, and questioned Findley's ability.  Go figure."

As a general note to anyone who may ask: Yes, you need to watch The Wire. It is without a doubt the greatest television series I have ever seen (better than Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, etc...)"
tfc,3djvu8,grabmit,7,Thu Jul 16 21:27:52 2015 UTC,"Aside from Dwayne De Rosario, Seba's legend is growing exponentially in Toronto.  An insecure part of me still holds on though to the prospect that some top-flight Serie A club might be keeping tabs on him and should he win the Golden Boot or take POTY honours, that he will be on the first flight out of town in January.   I am hoping that he stays here long enough to be a franchise legend.  (Fingers Crossed)"
tfc,3djvu8,GTARoadRager,5,Thu Jul 16 23:11:12 2015 UTC,"I too am a little insecure about Giovinco's commitment given all the drama we had with Defoe last season. Can you blame me?  However, I think the main difference this time is that by all accounts, Seba seems to legitimately enjoy it here.  It's impossible to tell in todays football market, but I think the main thing that will keep Giovinco in Toronto is his contract.   I think it's obvious TFC has absolutely no intention in putting him up for sale, MLSE makes more than enough money. His contributions on the pitch and marketability make him a valuable player to the company, would even a $50 million transfer fee be worth it to MLSE? Probably not, given how heavily they've been investing to raise the profile of our club in this city (and nothing does that better than winning, which Giovinco is doing almost singlehandedly for us).  Nothing Giovinco has said has suggested he is unhappy here in Toronto and would like to return to Italy. All things being equal, it's hard to imagine going back to Italy simply because MLSE pays him more than most clubs would. He's the highest paid Italian player in the world, and he can't even make the Italian national team. He will make more money playing for TFC than he would for any other club in Europe. Is a pay cut of a few million worth it to go back home?  His feelings about living in Toronto could change, but I think the only real reason he would leave is if he felt that playing in MLS was below him and that he wanted to compete in Champions League/Europa League level soccer.   Then again, I bet he prefers being MLS MVP to riding Juventus' bench."
tfc,3djvu8,R00K416,3,Fri Jul 17 02:45:21 2015 UTC,"You are definitely on point with your comments.  I think the biggest factor would be how he handles not getting capped for Euro 2016 and  Champions League.  I too believe that at the moment he is enjoying it.  This is virgin territory for us because never before have we had a highly-skilled European player join us whilst in his prime--it's always in the twilight of their career.    Ultimately, I think the greatest threat to Giovinco's tenure in Toronto is a high-tier BPL club transfer offer or a strong desire to win more extensive and prestigious silverware.  Plus, do you think the Azzurri decision-makers really put a lot of stock in MLS achievements?    As much as I am insecure about it, I will continue to enjoy his performances while he is still here.  It is a special time to be a TFC supporter right now."
tfc,3djvu8,GTARoadRager,3,Fri Jul 17 16:11:45 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, nobody is going to match his wages.  He's going nowhere, unless it's for non-financial reasons, and he seems genuinely happy here, so for the time being we have nothing to worry about.  He's really the best DP we could have ever asked for."
tfc,3djvu8,warpus,2,Fri Jul 17 06:03:00 2015 UTC,As Giovinco fan more than a toronto fan (sorry) the only team he is going to in Italy is Juventus. That's his boyhood club. Maybe a PL transfer is possible though.

It's unfortunate to see him retire due to his injuries, but I'm happy to see him remain with MLSE.  I hope this will open the opportunity for the club to find a new CB, but I don't know exactly how this will affect the cap and stuff like that.

tfc,3d934e,errboi,3,Tue Jul 14 14:28:41 2015 UTC,"Sad to see him go, he is a great guy. Also a great partner for Perquis, wish we had seen more of that.  All that said, with the freed up cap space we need to bring someone else in ASAP."
tfc,3d934e,LightsCameraRegret,2,Tue Jul 14 14:29:24 2015 UTC,"I thought I read somewhere that MLS closed that little loophole and that retiring mid-season wouldn't take a player off the books anymore. I can't find a source for it anymore though, so I guess it's just a rumour at this point."
tfc,3d934e,northendrix,6,Tue Jul 14 15:09:32 2015 UTC,Unfortunate that he couldn't go out without a couple of games this year.

Gio was legendary. A hat-trick in 8 minutes, are you kidding me?  Creavalle on the other hand, wow, just stop trying to make Creavalle happen...at least at RB. Please Vanney, stop. If he had never been moved to RB after being subbed on, I don't think we draw this one as horrid as our CBs played."
tfc,3d1vb0,wyman856,16,Sun Jul 12 21:12:18 2015 UTC,Probably the worst TFC substitution I've ever seen. Up a goal with 10 minutes left and Vanney puts in a guy who has been absolutely leaking goals when playing at RB... at RB. And they immediately score on his error. Are we supposed to be surprised by that outcome?
tfc,3d1vb0,-notthesun-,13,Sun Jul 12 21:29:57 2015 UTC,I can't grasp what Creavalle was thinking on that play.   This is a sentence I utter far too frequently.

tfc,3d1vb0,Menessy27,7,Sun Jul 12 21:56:23 2015 UTC,He hit it across our own goal. You should never do that unless you're actually going to clear the ball well out of the area.
tfc,3d1vb0,KJP13,7,Sun Jul 12 22:49:08 2015 UTC,"Make sure you launch into half, or walk it out of bounds.   Anything but a cross back into your own box."

tfc,3d1vb0,dragonsky,2,Mon Jul 13 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, outside of MLS, he's pretty underrated, though I was talking to a friend of mine in England today, who says he only watches MLS on TV when TFC are playing, purely cuz of Seba."
tfc,3d1vb0,red_gamble,25,Mon Jul 13 02:33:37 2015 UTC,Start Bendik vs. Philly
tfc,3d1vb0,Soldado4lyf,5,Sun Jul 12 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"I missed todays game so I can't comment on his performance, and last weeks destruction wasn't entirely on Konopka's shoulders, but back-to-back games of letting in 4 goals is as good an excuse as any to get Bendik back in the net."
tfc,3d1vb0,R00K416,5,Sun Jul 12 22:49:53 2015 UTC,Simply the lack of confidence after giving up 8 goals in two games. Time to put our starter back in net and agree that we have a better than average back up.
tfc,3d1vb0,mdps,3,Mon Jul 13 03:32:34 2015 UTC,"He's been bad for a while but getting away with it. Remember that one game where we were up late in like the 85th (vs Philly maybe?) and he came way out for a cross he shouldn't have, missed and left an open net that they very nearly scored on. Then that game a few weeks ago where he made an identical play to the penalty he gave away today but didn't get caught. After the first 4-5 games he's played he's been awful, and if he hadn't been getting lucky there would be a lot more complaints towards him"
tfc,3d1vb0,Menessy27,9,Mon Jul 13 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"Who fucked up royally and completely missed this game because they thought it was at 7:30?  This guy, this guy did."

But I was entertained as fuck.  Can't wait to have our gold cup boys back (and that new defensive signing)"
tfc,3d1vb0,warpus,8,Sun Jul 12 21:45:01 2015 UTC,"I'd have taken a draw on the road without Bradley any day of the week.  But that kinda sucked, man."
tfc,3d1vb0,red_gamble,6,Sun Jul 12 21:11:19 2015 UTC,"I'd of taken a draw too. So at the end of the day it's not the worse... shame we couldn't hold it after Marky scored, but oh well. Let's take it (as 99% of would have before the game) and move on to Philly. That's as game we gotta win."
tfc,3d1vb0,Menessy27,4,Sun Jul 12 21:29:53 2015 UTC,"Point on the road missing players is a good result... i'll just leave it at that. Actual game was a shitshow for both teams and the ref  Konopka was horrible once again. Penalty saves are nice but even then both his penalty saves ended up in the net 2 seconds later anyway so who cares. And it is now becoming a trend where he comes out for balls he shouldn't come out for and costs us. He did the exact same play he did today to give away the penalty a few weeks ago and was very lucky not to get called. Bendik needs to start next week without a doubt. Other than that I liked the lineup. Hagglund did well I thought. Jackson and Lovitz were really good as well. And the midfield was fairly solid. The defense also wasn't really bad... I mean they did score 4 goals but all 4 were off set pieces so it's not like they were doing much from open play. 2 pens, 1 free kick and 1 long free kick."
tfc,3d1vb0,TorontoFC15,2,Sun Jul 12 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"Giovinco was out of this world, what a game for him. I guess a draw isn't the end of the world but when you're scoring 4 goals in a game you have to be better on defence. Konopka wasn't too sharp either, hopefully Bendik will return to action next week"
tfc,3d1vb0,LearnedObserver2,3,Sun Jul 12 21:56:04 2015 UTC,Rough match to score 4 goals and walk out with only one point.

tfc,3d1msr,goonerdavid,8,Sun Jul 12 20:36:06 2015 UTC,Villa very clearly dived before the contact. He literally dragged his feet looking for the contact.
tfc,3d1msr,rypiso,4,Sun Jul 12 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"If he can't catch up to the ball then it's not a penalty. He kicked it out of play and let himself get hit. Stupid decision from Konopka to risk it, but that was not a penalty."
tfc,3d1msr,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"He was obviously going to go down, shows a lack of smarts on Konopka's part that he let himself get drawn in to the challenge.

tfc,3cyzhr,Soldado4lyf,5,Sun Jul 12 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"We need to win at home against Costa Rica, and we are through. It's so frustrating, we have been gifted what I consider to be the easiest group, yet instead of doing well we have been looking pretty bad. I don't know why Floro is playing some of the players that he is. I don't know why Osorio and Teibert aren't on the field, but they need to be. Also, Larin hasn't been bad I haven't thought. The service to him has been mediocre.  I flew up from St. John's for the game on Tuesday, and I would absolutely love to lose my shit and celebrate a win and advancement out of the group. (Toronto has been beautiful this weekend, by the way! I love this city every time I come).  If Jamaica can pepper El Salvador and we can beat Costa Rica, then we come 2nd, which I think is where we want to be for our best chance in the Quarters."

So I don't think losing the game to Jamaica hurt their chances much more than simply tying Jamaica.  Hopefully they can get BMO field rocking and Canada gets a true home field advantage.  I'd like to see Teibert and Osorio start.  Also, is Simeon Jackson hurt?  He's always shone for Canada.  They probably can't bring in all 3 midfielders, but I'd like to see a little more possession and offensive creativity there."

A win should see us take one of the 3rd place spots, a draw might even get us one.   That being said, I don't think we'll take full points if Floro doesn't change something. I get that he's trying to sort out the defensive side of things, but De Jong and Ledgerwood were awful so it really doesn't matter.  Stam, Morgan, Jako, Edgar, Ledgerwood, Piette, Teibert (LM), De Guzman, Osorio, Akindele, Larin   Play that and I think we win."

We all know that we were missing 4 players and moore (who is of course, an upgrade from Findley), but it caused our whole squad to move into uncomfortable positions.   Cheyrou who has been a beast for us, was just so uncomfortable and lost playing as Michael Bradley. He is the guy who holds position and drives the ball up.. not the guy who feeds goals.   Cravealle has been decent as midfielder, but as he proved at the start of the season, he doesn't work as a defender.   Delgado and Chapman are both promising, but they are completely lost without the leadership and direction of Bradley/Osorio. They're too inexperienced for both to be on the middle at the same time."

tfc,3c7d7h,Xstasy14,2,Sun Jul 5 17:06:51 2015 UTC,"that Morrow mistake... he's the last player i'd expect that from, so brutal"
tfc,3c63rz,lamycnd,3,Sun Jul 5 04:35:23 2015 UTC,We're gonna miss Bradley so fucking much the next few matches.
tfc,3c63rz,nourez,6,Sun Jul 5 04:35:56 2015 UTC,"We are going to miss every player away...   Crevalle had a rough one, Perquis was at fault for the terrible marking on the penatly and Morrow... backpass. The backline was pretty poor."
tfc,3c63rz,Samarama,4,Sun Jul 5 04:42:03 2015 UTC,I thought Zavaleta had a pretty good game for the outcome being 4-0.
tfc,3c63rz,R00K416,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:17:28 2015 UTC,"Good point, he had a quiet one and did his job efficiently."
tfc,3c63rz,errboi,3,Sun Jul 5 12:20:14 2015 UTC,Except when he almost put it in his own net.
tfc,3c63rz,R00K416,2,Sun Jul 5 14:56:08 2015 UTC,"Right, but almost putting it in is better than directly contributing to the an LA goal, which makes him the MVP of the backline, as each other defender fucked up royally and gave LA a goal."

tfc,3c63rz,ChillinOnTheBeach,4,Sun Jul 5 16:44:40 2015 UTC,"Three huge errors (well maybe two and a half for that dive) gave them their first three goals.

(who weren't missing as many key guys and has better depth anyways)."

tfc,3c63rz,Menessy27,2,Sun Jul 5 04:42:17 2015 UTC,"Not much to say other than that was just an awful performance. I didn't come in expecting much but still, that was just terrible."
tfc,3c63rz,errboi,2,Sun Jul 5 16:10:25 2015 UTC,It's not like we got dominated which you'd think by the scoreline but a few bonehead errors did us in. To be fair though LA is a top team and playing away against them is really difficult.
tfc,3c63rz,Menessy27,0,Sun Jul 5 19:13:29 2015 UTC,"Except we did get dominated. That was not a ""we played decently and got punished for every mistake"" type of game. That was just a thorough outclassing from start to finish."
tfc,3c63rz,iamthelight_,2,Sun Jul 5 21:38:04 2015 UTC,huh? it most definitely was not domination in any way other than the scoreline... the 1st and 3rd goals came out of nothing and the 4th was irrelevant as it came in stoppage time. Possession and shots were even the entire game as well. They just pounced on our bonehead mistakes and didn't make any themselves. At no point were they ever in complete control of the game in terms of actual play.
tfc,3c63rz,Shlongus,3,Mon Jul 6 04:16:51 2015 UTC,"That was unexpected for me. I didn't expect us to lose by four goals and to look so shitty in every aspect of the game.   In defense, with the exception of Perquis, we were shitty  In midfield, we were shitty  In offense, Findleys gonna Findley.  Horrriblee."
tfc,3c63rz,iamthelight_,2,Sun Jul 5 04:54:24 2015 UTC,Told myself not to overreact and blame Vaney but yeah. Even during the highs I still doubt his choices in team selection and to play this formation tonight. I was never sold on him. Why bring in top class players and not bring in a top class coach. Wouldn't buy a Ferrari and drive it slow.
tfc,3c63rz,Shlongus,4,Sun Jul 5 04:43:07 2015 UTC,Wouldn't buy a Ferrari and drive it slow.   Only that today we didn't have that Ferrari and we were left with a bicycle. You're judging his skill to manage players based on a game were said players didn't even play.
tfc,3c63rz,Menessy27,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:55:55 2015 UTC,I've thought about his managing skills during games we have had everyone. I just don't think he's good enough.

For TFC they have had enough talent to represent the team as whole and frankly I don't think Vaney has been good enough. If they spend all this money bringing all this talent they should had done the same with the coaching staff."
tfc,3c5sa4,Aljug,9,Sun Jul 5 02:13:41 2015 UTC,Hopefully they find a way to get a defender.

tfc,3c5sa4,MetalKreature,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:05:47 2015 UTC,Interesting that he said significant so it's likely a starter or someone capable of challenging for a starting spot... seems likely to be either a centerback or a central midfielder. Not sure how they'd fit it in. Maybe another Caldwell like situation where he makes a lot less in his first season
tfc,3c5sa4,Menessy27,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:34:21 2015 UTC,Maybe another Caldwell like situation where he makes a lot less in his first season   How exactly do loans affect the cap?  Does a player's salary carry over even if TFC aren't paying his wages?

tfc,3c5r9t,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:02:19 2015 UTC,Zavaleta in possession is awful. Lots of mistakes now.  Creavalle is just the same. Both look completely out of place in our backline right now. Need to play Caldwell and Haggland next game I think.

tfc,3c3spp,errboi,-1,Sat Jul 4 21:56:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I particularly disagree with the sentiment, but I find it... Depressing? Unfortunate?  I don't rate Michael Bradley. I hate watching him play. It legitimately annoys me. I didn't like him at Roma, I don't rate him in the American squad, and I scream at him more than I praise at TFC."
tfc,3c3spp,TorontoHooligan,3,Sat Jul 4 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I felt similarly about his play in the second half of last year, but he's been much improved this season since he's had his defensive responsibilities limited. He's not super exciting to watch in that he's not terribly crafty and he's not going to regularly beat players through individual skill, but I think he's been undeniably effective at distributing the ball into dangerous areas both for the US and for TFC. He's good at creating chances from a slightly more withdrawn position than your traditional CAM, and he's good at making late runs into the box."
tfc,3c3spp,errboi,-1,Sat Jul 4 22:20:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking for a player that is crafty, special,  win 1on1s in midfield, etc. I disagree about his distribution, and he holds on to the ball for far too long, often being dispossessed. His passes are often weighted badly, either too strong or lacking intent, and while I see where you might get the impression that he's a good deep-lying playmaker, again I disagree with the fact he is effective here as his passes are inaccurate, or sideways to advancing fullbacks."
tfc,3c2166,BanksKnowsBest,3,Sat Jul 4 01:01:45 2015 UTC,It's it just me or do they not say the time of the game?     Kind of weird that they'd not put it in when trying bring people out.      It's 8:30 for anyone wondering.

tfc,3c0njc,TorontoFC15,5,Fri Jul 3 18:10:41 2015 UTC,A tie would be more than acceptable going into tomorrow's match.  I don't expect to pick up points but I'm hopeful we get another dynamite performance from Seba and steal some points on the road.
tfc,3c0njc,R00K416,3,Fri Jul 3 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just going into the game expecting the worst, missing so many key players it will be tough. If we manage to get a draw I'll be happy."

Perquis isn't particularly physically dominating so having a big presence beside him will help with defending set plays in the box. The problem is Perquis isn't nearly as mobile (or reliable) as a Koscielny so we need a big frame with some foot speed which is hard to find on the cheap.

Realistically, a center back or a goalkeeper above all else. Ciaran Clark (Villa) has his contract expiring and is on 650k pounds p/y ish right now, so it's not outrageous, Senderos is on 780 dollars, Spolli from Catania (expiring) if we wanna go Italian. For keepers, Julio Cesar fits the salary range (especially with the Euro tanking) and his contract is up...

tfc,3bxudj,kierdoyle,0,Sat Jul 4 18:14:21 2015 UTC,"I've played with/against Q for 6 years, he's super athletic but that's where his ability ends."

tfc,3bxudj,kierdoyle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"Bono's adjusting to a new environment, Q has played with a lot of those guys for years. In terms of pure ability, Bono is probably better. Regardless, neither is MLS ready at all."
tfc,3bxudj,Coramoor_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"the problem is that everyone was saying Bono was ready to compete for Bendik's job and then he came in and looked terrible, he's improved certainly but only time will tell"
tfc,3bx7vn,quelar,3,Thu Jul 2 22:11:18 2015 UTC,Perquis fine by MDPS for the second straight week.

tfc,3buhrf,triskelions,7,Thu Jul 2 06:44:47 2015 UTC,CP   There has to be a better name.
tfc,3buhrf,ScreamingGerman,3,Thu Jul 2 14:38:34 2015 UTC,"If we could somehow get Gilberto back with this new rule, then that would be phenomenal. It might only apply to home-grown talent though (as in, Canadian or American players) so I'm not positive it'd work. Nor do I think Gilberto would want to come back. I'd love to see him though. And if the rule is for players under $1M as some have suggested, then Gilberto would likely apply (and if need be, paid down with Garberbucks).  But as I said, I doubt Gil wants to return. In that case, I don't know what Canadian player would be worth it. Maybe Atiba, but that might be too late. If not him, then I say we hold out. I don't think we desperately need a big reinforcement."
tfc,3buhrf,EasterlyFan,6,Thu Jul 2 10:19:48 2015 UTC,"Gilberto would be extremely redundant, at best a fantastic bench player in this line-up. His presence would be useful during the Gold Cup, but otherwise wasted once Jozy returns.  What we need is a quality CB that keeps Zavaleta on the bench."
tfc,3buhrf,R00K416,2,Thu Jul 2 10:56:20 2015 UTC,"Agree, CB has to be the biggest means of improvement given our current lineup. Everyone else would solidify our bench."
tfc,3buhrf,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:48:22 2015 UTC,"He'd be redundant in this formation, but might he fit into a 4-3-3? Altidore, Gio and Gil up front with Osorio, Bradley and Cheyrou in the middle would be quite lethal. Although I don't know if Altidore and Gio would be as effective in that set up?  Just an idea, I'm not pushing for it or anything."
tfc,3buhrf,EasterlyFan,2,Thu Jul 2 12:38:41 2015 UTC,"We've been playing a midfield diamond type thing, that wouldn't work too well with a 4-3-3.  Vanney's strategy seems to be ""Let's win the battle in midfield"" and get the ball to our strikers.  A 4-3-3 would also work better with some ""true"" wingers out wide, and Gio could do the job, but I prefer him to play more centrally, I think he's more effective there.  So I'd love to see Gilberto back, but I think we can make better use of that core spot."
tfc,3buhrf,warpus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:38:34 2015 UTC,Like this?  It seems pretty solid but we'll be a bit light on the wings/wide play.
tfc,3buhrf,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"Just what I was thinking, yep.   Again, not saying that this is our best route, but I did love Gil. IF they brought him back (and I doubt they will) I imagine this would be the direction to go."
tfc,3buhrf,EasterlyFan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"What about a 4-1-3-2 Formation with Bradley as the Center AM, Jozy and Gio up top, and Gilberto and Osorio playing left and right AMs? Cheyrou obviously DM, and normal back line."

tfc,3bclee,DragonicKhaos,6,Sat Jun 27 23:03:12 2015 UTC,We were the better team but we just weren't syncing like we did on Wednesday.
tfc,3bclee,LightsCameraRegret,2,Sun Jun 28 00:49:46 2015 UTC,"Credit D.C. for that, much quicker to close us down than Montreal. Every time we got the ball in the box they collapsed quickly to reduce our options. Montreal was giving us way more space.  Still, we fashioned a few really good chances, shame we couldn't put one away. But can't be too upset soundly outplaying the top team in the conference."
tfc,3bclee,-notthesun-,5,Sun Jun 28 19:48:06 2015 UTC,Miserable day at BMO Field. But I was impressed with how many people showed despite the weather. And the supporters sections was still in fine form. That's some real pride.
tfc,3bclee,mdps,2,Sun Jun 28 05:09:24 2015 UTC,Most fun ive had getting that soaked in a long long time!
tfc,3bclee,Urban_Thug,3,Sun Jun 28 05:15:40 2015 UTC,"I'm upset we didn't get 3 points as I thought it could have been a winnable game, also could have used those points before we lose 4 guys.   My prediction of a high scoring game was thrown out the window, I hate 0-0 draws."
tfc,3bclee,TorontoFC15,3,Sun Jun 28 02:41:04 2015 UTC,"Well against the best team in the east in horrible conditions, a draw is acceptable. TFC is third in the east on goal differential and a point back of NE. At this point you take as many as you can get. 3 points would have been fantastic but 1 point is totally fine."
tfc,3bclee,JJ-ot9f,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:19:15 2015 UTC,"See the way I looked at it coming into this game was we managed to get all 3 against DC the previous game at RFK, shouldn't be a reason we can't do it at home. A point is a point though, a little sad because the Revs also blew it against the Whitecaps and we could have overtaken them."
tfc,3bclee,TorontoFC15,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:42:34 2015 UTC,This was the first tfc game i've ever fully watched. Is it safe to say that our defense and midfield are superb but that we are lacking a solid striker?
tfc,3bclee,Urban_Thug,10,Sun Jun 28 01:48:35 2015 UTC,Not at all. We have solid strikers in Giovinco and Altidore. It was just not a good day probably due the weather and it being DC United (Top team in the league)
tfc,3bclee,iamthelight_,3,Sun Jun 28 01:59:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah... Everyone was misfiring in the final third. Gio not pulling the trigger when he has chances and then pulling the trigger when there is a better passing option. Altidore with that mishandled ball in the box that he kept trying to drag his foot across or something and just couldn't get a grip.   Also, how many of our corner kicks made it past the first defender, and of those that made it past the first defender, how many made it to a TFC player?"
tfc,3bclee,errboi,2,Sun Jun 28 02:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we've been very poor at corner kicks all season, but today was particularly bad. We can definitely do better on all of our set pieces."

tfc,3bclee,Urban_Thug,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:20:12 2015 UTC,"Almost the opposite actually. Our defence and midfield aren't bad but also aren't amazing or anything.   Giovinco is the best player in the league and Altidore is also really good, this team would be average without them tbh."

People often take this type of attitude and refuse to give credit when it's due because past teams were bad. It's a completely different team with a different president, a different GM and a different coach from 5 years ago and to constantly hold that over their heads is dumb. It seems any praise of the team is followed by ""oh well i'll believe they're a good team when they're in the playoffs because past teams sucked"" it makes no sense to constantly compare them to players that they have no relation to"
tfc,3b9nx8,TorontoFC15,3,Sat Jun 27 03:03:50 2015 UTC,"HUGE game for TFC. Need to rack up as many points as possible before Altidore, Bradley, and Osorio leave for the Gold Cup."

If it ain't broke, don't fix it.   Cheyrou still isn't fit apparently, and Ashtone Morgan may feature.

Osorio basically said in his interview about the match that at the end of the day we beat them in their home.. implying that it's gonna be easier here.   However, we have lost 40% of home games and 50% of away games. Only a 10% difference. We can't get too confident.   If we don't win this game I won't feel comfortable with our chances with Altidore and Bradley gone."

A win would be huge for a first place charge but a draw would keep us where we are now, still th same amount of points back with 5 games in hand. Also it's sad that now I go into every game hoping the other team doesnt foul the shit out of us because that's their best chance of beating us  Might as well start Konopka... it's not like Bendik was particularly good before"

tfc,3b6ep1,Soldado4lyf,2,Fri Jun 26 17:01:41 2015 UTC,Forgot he was still on the books tbh
tfc,3b6ep1,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:16:09 2015 UTC,He's injured and we don't play with wingers anyway. Jackson is the only winger that plays regularly because he's very versatile and can be subbed in for a variety of players
tfc,3b6ep1,Menessy27,5,Sat Jun 27 00:31:35 2015 UTC,"Also: HUGE DAY for the Toronto Maple Leafs, as it is finally draft day. We currently have two 1st round picks at 4th, and 24th overall. If we're gonna successfully rebuild into a pseudo-dynasty like Chicago (they're not a real dynasty yet), we have to get both of those picks right.  I hope Mitch Marner is available for us at 4th, and I think the Leafs will take him if he is. That said, I think we're going to get a good player if we end up with Strome, Hanafin, or Provorov.  I have no idea who will be available at 24. I'd love to trade up to the early teens and take Travis Konecny, or pray he falls to us (he won't)."
tfc,3b6ep1,R00K416,3,Fri Jun 26 11:22:45 2015 UTC,Chicago are about as real of a dynasty as you'll get in the cap era. They really are a phenomenal team.  Just hope we don't retain salary on either Phaneuf or Kessel.
tfc,3b6ep1,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:14:19 2015 UTC,"I remember when after Chicago won the cup for the 2009-10 season they had to give away some of their players due to the cap. They saw players like Dustin Byfuglien, Brent Sopel, Kris Versteeg, and Andrew Ladd leave in the summer. But they kept the core together, added picks, strengthened the team around it, and won two more cups. That's really amazing. The Blackhawks organization from top to bottom is pure class. Here's hoping Shanahan creates a similar culture in Toronto for the Leafs."
tfc,3b6ep1,JJ-ot9f,2,Fri Jun 26 16:42:01 2015 UTC,Just gotta find our Toews. What a player.
tfc,3b6ep1,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:48:55 2015 UTC,"I still can't believe Chicago got him at 3rd overall. Pittsburgh got Jordan Staal at #2. What a fit Toews has been for them.  And yeah, the Leafs got a chance to get their Toews tonight! Wouldn't mind Hanifin/Provorov but they've been needing that solid number one centre since Sundin. I'm excited really. I just want 7pm to be here already!"
tfc,3b6ep1,JJ-ot9f,2,Fri Jun 26 17:27:55 2015 UTC,"Due to Mark Hunter's relationship with Mitch Marner in the past, I totally see the Leafs picking him. Plus he's a forward who fits the Leafs' forward core very well, and he's a centre who's not done growing yet.   It all depends on who GMDM and Arizona picks, and I think Strome/Hanafin is a lock for them even if they have the option of uniting Marner with Max Domi and Christian Dvorak who played together in London."

That Chorwat song I've heard before many years ago, I completely forgot it even existed..  So thanks for sharing eh!   You've opened me up to some new Polish genres.   There's definitely a lot of good stuff out there.  I've been trying to get at as much of it as possible, since it seems musicians in Poland are really starting to find their groove.  Not that they weren't previously, but I think the technology is finally catching up with everything.  Post-communism I don't think many aspiring musicians could really afford much equipment..  These days it seems that a lot of music is very professionally produced - which can make a huge impact on how the song turns out in the end.  And this is just a guess, but the country re-joining the West seems to have made a huge impact on musical ideas and so on.  I wonder if you're going to be into any of this reggae.  I used to be quite a bit into SKA so when I figured out that Reggae was huge in Poland, I started listening to it en masse.  These tunes are a bit more hip-hoppish, so maybe you'll appreciate them too (and might have heard them already):  EastWest Rockers - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhJBnwQE8Fo  Vavamuffin - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8bOyCq0OXw  Mesajah - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiXBpNg3v8o"

tfc,3b6ep1,Kim_Jong_Unchained,3,Fri Jun 26 11:49:11 2015 UTC,"Okay hold onto your butts:   Chance The Rapper - Favourite Song   His 2013 project ""Acid Rap"" was voted 4th best album of 2013 by Complex. A native of Chicago, Chance is part of the Save Money crew which also features Towkio & Vic Mensa (guys I posted above). I can only describe his style as zany. Definitely not for everyone but Chance truly is one of a kind.   Danny Brown - Dip   Another stand-out album from 2013, Detroit native Danny Brown's ""Old"" is divided into two distinct parts: the first half represents his older music (in which he mostly uses a deeper voice), and the second absolutely flips it on it's head with straight bangers (where he uses his adopted, higher pitched voice). Must have for turning up on a Friday night.   Run The Jewels - Banana Clipper   I know it was already recommended but go download this album ""Run The Jewels"" now!!! RTJ is a duo featuring NY's El-P, and Atlanta's Killer Mike. Hands down the most lethal group in hip-hop at the moment.   Isaiah Rashad - Soliloquy   The newest member of TDE (label that includes Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock & SZA - pretty much the best collective in hip-hop), his 2014 album ""Cilvia Demo"" was my favourite project last year.   J. Cole - G.O.M.D. (Get Off My Dick)   His album ""2014 Forest Hills Drive"" dropped in late 2014, but had incredible word of mouth and it deserves the hype. Some people say J. Cole is boring and bland, but I call it traditional. Some real shit on that album, featuring great production (that he did himself!)   Majid Jordan - Her   It's not hip-hop per say but they are signed to Drake's OVO label. Their 2014 EP ""A Place Like This"" was my 2nd favourite project of 2014. Absolutely incredible production, singing, and songwriting from Majid Al Maskati (vocalist) and Jordan Ullman (producer). Support these local Toronto artists!   Run The Jewels - Oh My Darling (Don't Cry)   DOWNLOAD ""RUN THE JEWELS 2"" TOO.   ScHoolboy Q - Man of the Year   Q makes being a gangster fun. Another TDE member, his 2014 album ""Oxymoron"" is a memorable one. Was in my top 5 for that year.   100s - Ten Freaky Hoes   Unfortunately, the artist 100s ceased to rap entirely under that name and now makes some shitty new wave stuff under the name Kossisko. Thankfully, he dropped his EP ""IVRY"" before hand. Brought back G-Funk to a modern era, if only for 8 songs.   Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment - Sunday Candy   Donnie Trumpet (aka Nico Segal) & SOX are also members of Chicago's Save Money crew. Their free 2015 album ""Surf"" features a bazillion artists (including a bunch of Chance features) and is a must download, in my opinion.   Kendrick Lamar - King Kunta   His 2015 album ""To Pimp a Butterfly"" is an absolute masterpiece, a true work of art. Not for basic listeners. It only has one or two accessible tracks. May be hard to digest, but if you give it time, you will appreciate why TDE's Kendrick Lamar is the greatest rapper in the game (sorry Drake, not sorry Kanye lol)   Lupe Fiasco - Mural   Again, Lupe Fiasco is probably not for the average listener (case in point, this 8 minute track of straight bars). But if you value lyricism, wordplay, and MC's who can actually spit, you will really like his 2015 album ""Tetsuo & Youth."" A return to form for Lupe after a depressing couple of years.  That should give you a good start."

tfc,3b2lgt,section111,3,Thu Jun 25 14:41:44 2015 UTC,"Started it?  Was the cheap shot to the balls before or after he got elbowed in the face which made his nose bleed? Both teams were giving and taking punishment all game. That's irrelevant anyway.  You're missing the point entirely if you chalk up an elbow to the back of his head as acceptable because of an earlier skirmish.  Do you think it's acceptable to potentially give a guy a brain injury? MLS apparently does.  Vanney was completely right to continue to bitch about it in his post-game interview last night, and it's not something that we should ""just move on..."" from."
tfc,3b2lgt,R00K416,0,Thu Jun 25 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"It was a punch in the balls followed immediately by a whack in the back. Part of the 'giving and taking [of] punishment all game' as you mentioned. When I say 'started it', I mean the actual sequence everyone's talking about.   And the elbow to the head was more of a forearm to the back anyway. Loathe though I am to agree with Kurt Larson, he rightly pointed out that his head snapped back, like whiplash. Wouldn't've happened if he hit his head. I have little sympathy for a cheap shot to the balls, so yeah, if he gets a straightarm in the back, so be it.    Anyway, doesn't matter.

I firmly believe Toronto is a top five team in the league this year in terms of players and quality on the field.  I feel like Vanney is doing a good job, and honestly, I feel like aside from a few errors he has been doing well all year.  I feel like we are 100% in contention for the Supporter's Shield, and with it a playoff spot. If we make the playoffs, I believe we have a phenomenal chance of going deep.  Injuries can happen, and who knows what else, but this team has the quality to make it far if things go out way. I don't want to be overly optimistic... but man oh man am I optimistic."
tfc,3b2937,EasterlyFan,2,Thu Jun 25 14:04:43 2015 UTC,"Vanney wasn't doing well at the start of the season. He was playing everyone wrong, playing high defensive lines that were killing us. It was a mess tbh..  But then he did what a smart coach does and adapted. Changed what wasn't working and stuck with what is working. Ryan Nelsen last year refused to take any responsibility and refused to fix his shit. He would say that the match wasn't important and would blame us and management for pressuring him into getting his shit together.   Point being... Greg Vanney has the right attitude and that has been the difference maker. He is not an excuse man. He is willing to see when something is not right and adapt accordingly."
tfc,3b2937,iamthelight_,2,Thu Jun 25 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"I agree to an extent. There were people calling for his head five or six games into the season, which is a bit ridiculous. It was clear that opportunity was there, and its going to take any team with this many new pieces a few games to figure it out. Vanney had a vision and when he spoke he could tell you about it. As you say, when things didn't work, he tried something new. He did that until it worked. I like Vanney, I really do. I think that he is doing a lot of good, and I think he will continue to do so."

We still have 5 games in hand on 1st place. 12 pts back with 15 points up for grabs in games in hand so getting to 1st in the East is fully in our hands. If we beat DC this week it drops down to 9 pts back with 5 games in hand. Things are looking good.

tfc,3b0wdo,BasedPython,6,Thu Jun 25 02:03:35 2015 UTC,"Warner did a solid job winning back possession and maintaining it. Arguably the x factor for Toronto, allowing them to maintain possession and limit dangerous counter attacks. Delgado somehow made Creavalle look good at right back by providing excellent link up."
tfc,3b0wdo,warpus,3,Thu Jun 25 02:18:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was good to see Delgado and Warner play well.  The gold cup is coming.."
tfc,3b0wdo,mdps,2,Thu Jun 25 04:59:05 2015 UTC,Agree that Warner was excellent defensively. His passing improved in the second half and that helpd the transition immensely. He'll be needed for a few games with Bradley away.
tfc,3b0wdo,Coramoor_,5,Thu Jun 25 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"Delgado was very impressive tonight, looking like a great pickup in the dispersal draft."
tfc,3b0wdo,mdps,2,Thu Jun 25 03:26:17 2015 UTC,"Impressive is an understatement. He had a few rookie mistakes, but overall played energetic, smart, strong football. Load of fun to watch."
tfc,3b0wdo,Ahzuran,3,Thu Jun 25 16:24:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like crying in joy every time I watch this team now. They're so good and they're dominating possession even in losses which is something most of us dreamed for years. After sticking through 8 years of disappointment and frustration, I think I can safely say we deserve this without sounding arrogant."
tfc,3b0wdo,FormerSlacker,3,Thu Jun 25 03:04:16 2015 UTC,I thought Delgado was really good tonight.
tfc,3b0wdo,-notthesun-,4,Thu Jun 25 03:31:39 2015 UTC,"Seeing that live in the stadium was something else. Best TFC match I've ever attended by far. Giovinco was his usual incredible self, Bradley is in some kind of form, and Altidore's goal was gorgeous, what a finish. Very solid games from the rest of the team today as well, I thought everyone was good and was pleasantly surprised by Delgado. And fuck Montreal. Great win."
tfc,3b0wdo,The_Goose_is_Moose,3,Thu Jun 25 03:43:46 2015 UTC,"This game got my hopes way up. I know I'll be disappointed in the end, but for now I'm gonna revel in this experience. This is what I dreamed Giovinco, Altidore, and Bradley would be."
tfc,3b0wdo,Bdog5,3,Thu Jun 25 02:03:10 2015 UTC,Fuck the impact!  Great job by the DPs.
tfc,3b0wdo,TorontoFC15,4,Thu Jun 25 05:42:41 2015 UTC,"Suck it tabernacs. Great game, so happy to beat Montreal whenever given the chance"
tfc,3b0wdo,joshuawakefield,2,Thu Jun 25 03:47:00 2015 UTC,"Brilliant game. We looked great going forward, including some really neat interchange play between Gio, Altidore, and Bradley. We did look a bit weak when Montreal would counter quickly, but thought overall we looked really good. Can't wait for Saturday."
tfc,3b0wdo,kierdoyle,2,Thu Jun 25 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"Finally broke the curse of us losing when I attend. Gio was spectacular. Altidore's goal was exceptionally well taken, Bradley great. Delgado looked more than capable of taking Oso's minutes during the Gold Cup. Even Findley sort of looked dangerous.   Just need to iron out some of the mistakes at the back and we'll be looking good."
tfc,3b0wdo,mdps,2,Thu Jun 25 04:03:16 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why Cheyrou and Morgan weren't available last night?
tfc,3b0wdo,Coramoor_,2,Thu Jun 25 16:34:45 2015 UTC,"Cheyrou has a calf issue, Morgan has the flu"
tfc,3b0wdo,mdps,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:31:56 2015 UTC,Thanks. Not another calf issue. That seems to be an ailment that takes forever to heal.
tfc,3b0wdo,BleedBlueAndWhite,3,Fri Jun 26 01:35:04 2015 UTC,"Terrific effort from TFC. Really good games by our 3 DP's but Osorio, Warner and Delgado played very well too and guys like them will be key when Bradley and Altidore are away for the Gold Cup."
tfc,3b0wdo,R00K416,5,Thu Jun 25 02:19:44 2015 UTC,(Osorio will also be away during the Gold Cup.)
tfc,3b0wdo,iamthelight_,2,Thu Jun 25 02:39:07 2015 UTC,"Perquis also played very well. The unsong hero of this season IMO. He has brought the skills, experience and knowledge into the defense."
tfc,3b0wdo,errboi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:17:33 2015 UTC,"Depends. He looked like the major culprit in a couple of our early season collapses at the back. Drifted off his man leaving easy crosses for attackers to finish. That problem seems to have gone away, which is interesting since it doesn't feel like we're winning that many more headers in the box and Konopka isn't coming out to claim any more crosses than Bendik did. I guess maybe we're just doing a better job of cutting out those deliveries into the box before they actually get into the box."
tfc,3b0wdo,Menessy27,2,Thu Jun 25 06:48:33 2015 UTC,"We're not so bad when the referee doesn't allow the other team to foul mercilessly and actually makes correct penalty calls at both ends... /still butthurt about that stupid game  Bradley was amazing today and our team's passing in general was probably the best it's been all season even without Cheyrou. Although Osorio was very disappointing in my opinion. In general he seems to overthink and doubt his own ability especially when he has a chance to score. But our depth midfielders like Warner, Creavalle, Chapman and today Delgado have all shown well so we should be fine"
tfc,3b0z22,iamthelight_,7,Thu Jun 25 02:23:15 2015 UTC,excellent point
tfc,3b0z22,Boethius13,6,Thu Jun 25 04:06:02 2015 UTC,That and the fact that end game breakdowns seems to have gone away for us. It's no longer a forgone conclusion that we'll concede around the 80'.
tfc,3b0z22,ScreamingGerman,2,Thu Jun 25 12:33:50 2015 UTC,"I agree. So many times this season i've said something like ""oh shit the opponent has on a 3 on 2 break... oh nevermind its a 3 on 5 now"". We get numbers back really quickly now and do so much more pressing. Under Nelsen players just jogged back when the opponent countered"
tfc,3b112m,SkittlezTrench92,6,Thu Jun 25 02:40:15 2015 UTC,I like when he yelled fuck
tfc,3b112m,Bdog5,3,Thu Jun 25 05:37:53 2015 UTC,I read up on the guy and apparently he holds a dual American and Polish citizenship.  As if we have two (technically) Polish guys on the team.
tfc,3b112m,warpus,3,Thu Jun 25 04:54:30 2015 UTC,Konopka seems like a cool guy. I remember a All for One episode last season with him inviting Nick Hagglund over for dinner. He just seems like a genuinely nice person.
tfc,3b112m,EasterlyFan,2,Thu Jun 25 14:02:24 2015 UTC,Haha love it! Cross post it to /r/mls!
tfc,3b112m,lmHuge,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:46:05 2015 UTC,I actually posted it there first! But shortly after it was no longer there and now someone else has posted it.
tfc,3b1dqs,TorontoFC15,2,Thu Jun 25 04:35:28 2015 UTC,So much better than TSN's recap. Thanks for posting!
tfc,3ayy0z,rrrake,6,Wed Jun 24 16:55:34 2015 UTC,Or.. you know .. buyer beware?    Why would you let one person ruin it for the others who haven't ripped people off?  I'm sure the person who did could be reported to mlse and they would be dealt with.  Somehow I'm sure they don't like people selling multiple copies of the same ticket.
tfc,3ayy0z,TorontoFC15,3,Wed Jun 24 22:35:31 2015 UTC,"It's not something we were ever that comfortable with. We aren't keen on fostering person to person deals simply because we felt that an unofficial, unmoderated arena such as this is too dangerous for either party. If two people want to buy from each other personally, they can just as easily partake in that on sites such as Kijiji, whose focus is on those kinds of transactions. Granted they're TFC tickets, but this subreddit isn't really for that.  I'm not sure about the MLSE part. I reckon the fact that you aren't buying through an official mean will make them turn a blind eye to it, considering you're fairly close to scalping a ticket. The potential of that to be true makes me think an MLSE crackdown isn't guaranteed."
tfc,3ayy0z,Corlando,3,Wed Jun 24 23:29:34 2015 UTC,1814?
tfc,3ayy0z,errboi,4,Wed Jun 24 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"I think they are referencing the amount of subs this subreddit has and you are the only one against ticket selling here which isn't true by any means, I'm all for the action that you guys took."
tfc,3ayy0z,errboi,9,Wed Jun 24 23:54:37 2015 UTC,"There's only 1813 now, the bad apple must have left. We're safe now guys!"
tfc,3ayy0z,joshuawakefield,5,Thu Jun 25 00:11:32 2015 UTC,Party on!
tfc,3ayy0z,sasha_baron_of_rohan,3,Thu Jun 25 01:10:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm all for it as well. There are plenty of other avenues for purchasing tickets, both officially and unofficially."
tfc,3ayy0z,ekdaemon,2,Thu Jun 25 02:00:00 2015 UTC,I'd say a 92% upvote rate suggests you're probably the minority opinion here.
tfc,3ayy0z,mafiazul,3,Thu Jun 25 02:06:22 2015 UTC,The support from this forum over what happened has been pretty amazing. Hope you guys all enjoyed the match today. The atmosphere was incredible.
tfc,3ayy0z,notdarren,3,Thu Jun 25 02:12:02 2015 UTC,So one bad experience has caused the mods to end something positive about this place?
tfc,3ayy0z,notdarren,2,Thu Jun 25 02:37:46 2015 UTC,"Is stubhub ""an official source""?  Or does it just make it easy to reverse the charge onto the person selling the ticket if the purchaser claims they didn't receive the goods or weren't able to get in, just like eBay and paypal for online goods purchases?"

tfc,3ayg5c,Soldado4lyf,4,Wed Jun 24 16:41:30 2015 UTC,haha i forgot it SJB Day.....that would make it extra sweet!
tfc,3ayg5c,mcdust1989,7,Wed Jun 24 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"Really like to see Zavaleta replaced. Give Hagglund another go, or Caldwell if fit.  Think Luke Moore is a passenger after the NYC game. Players are going to get physical, rough, dirty with Gio and the second striker needs to be big and physical to grab the attention of their strongest defender. Moore was just too invisible given what was happening to Gio."
tfc,3ayg5c,ScreamingGerman,4,Wed Jun 24 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"While I respect your opinion, I feel like people should look at the overall picture instead of single performances. Hagglund is nowhere near as solid as Zavaleta has been since joining the starting XI. Last week was the only major fuck up we've seen from him, the rest have been very solid performances."
tfc,3ayg5c,iamthelight_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:26:51 2015 UTC,"He's had a few good games; I've thought the same of Hagglund before and Caldwell was our former captain. Out of everyone I'd like to see Perquis and Caldwell play together, the experience of those two should make them a solid combination."
tfc,3ayg5c,ScreamingGerman,3,Wed Jun 24 18:31:15 2015 UTC,TFC need to use Altidore to hold up more often and have gio pop in and out of the channels to get behind the lines or get him 1v1 situations where he can shoot...I felt like vs NYFC he was trying to do too much on the ball in non goal threatening situations and he was getting fouled in the process....at the back the CBS need to give up nothing and clear all crosses.....those are my two keys looking forward to taking the match at BMO tn!
tfc,3ayg5c,mcdust1989,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:40:21 2015 UTC,I hope Konopka keeps playing. He has done nothing to lose the starting position.
tfc,3ayg5c,CrashingForeignCars,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:44:47 2015 UTC,I agree. He's been solid and there's absolutely no reason to not have him start.

tfc,3av5uu,joshuawakefield,13,Tue Jun 23 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"I know his full name, cell phone number, and place of employment, but I don't really feel like pursuing it to that degree. Just watch out for him. Bad dude.   I think you're doing a disservice to other TFC fans by not pursuing reparations.  All they need to do is make a new account and they can continue to scam people. Maybe it was an egregious error on their part, and mistakenly sold without malice, but I highly doubt it.  I'm not sure if it's against the subreddit rules but I think they deserve to have their personal information posted, so that other people can make sure to avoid him.  I also urge you to get in contact with MLSE to get him banned from buying tickets, and banned from BMO. It's pathetic, inexcusable behaviour like this that give TFC fans a bad name.  If you don't feel comfortable, PM me the info.  EDIT: Okay, yeah, posting personal information on here is a little rash and I agree, definitely should not happen.  That said, I think this can be prevented by informing MLSE about it. I don't know what they will do, but I assume they care about protecting their brand, and this guy is hurting it."
tfc,3av5uu,R00K416,6,Tue Jun 23 20:54:26 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the feedback. I know Reddit isn't big on revealing personal info, and despite what happened, neither am I. However, with that being said, you've definitely raised some good points and they have changed my point of view slightly. Let me have a think about sending you the info. Thanks once again. I had momentarily lost a bit of faith in our fans when it happened."
tfc,3av5uu,FlyingCarsArePlanes,-3,Tue Jun 23 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"Send my info to this guy and I'll pursue legal action. I did not offer all my info, then proceed to scam you. I did an honest transaction and I hold no liability. You take a risk buying 3rd party tickets and I did as well through VividSeats. I will work with you on this though."
tfc,3av5uu,Corlando,5,Wed Jun 24 16:44:03 2015 UTC,"I think they deserve to have their personal information posted   Uh, no one does.  And it's also highly against Reddit's rules.  Please report this guy to MLSE.  Please don't let us go on a witch hunt against him."
tfc,3av5uu,R00K416,3,Tue Jun 23 22:44:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for talking sense here.
tfc,3av5uu,R00K416,2,Wed Jun 24 14:32:09 2015 UTC,You're right.  Even that guy doesn't deserve the wrath of Reddit.  I've edited my post to better represent how I feel.
tfc,3av5uu,ScreamingGerman,-1,Wed Jun 24 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"You acting as if your the law is funny. Asking u/joshuawakefield for my personal info? Fuck you dude. I gave him all my personal info because I was making an honest sale. I bought the tickets through VividSeats.com and sold them only to u/joshuawakefield.  I was out of town after Saturday night and did not receive any texts, calls or PM's, which I can also prove. I'm going to deactivate this account now though as my info has been exposed."
tfc,3av5uu,red_gamble,2,Wed Jun 24 16:45:56 2015 UTC,"I've admitted my initial reaction was rash, unnecessary, and flat out wrong, and edited my statement to better reflect my views long before you made an appearance in this thread.  Any instigation I caused was born out of my love for the club. I am proud to be a fan of TFC and I hate the idea of diminishing our reputation as a fan base. Given the FHRITP incident from earlier this year, I don't think it's unreasonable to be protective of that.  I buy all my tickets second hand, I'm not in the wrong for being curious about who to avoid to prevent things like this happening.  But if what you say is entirely true, then I apologize. That said, I didn't post your information, nor did I even see it for the brief time is was posted thanks to our great mods who removed it soon after it was posted.  Thankfully it won't be an issue in this community again, so we can now focus on bigger issues like kicking the shit out of Montreal tonight.  COYR"

tfc,3av5uu,iamthelight_,5,Tue Jun 23 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear that you had a negative experience with another Redditor. It's reasons like these that we encourage buying tickets through 'official' channels - there are some more well-known users around here that you might trust buying tickets off of, but otherwise, stick to Ticketmaster or Stubhub. Be safe.  As others have mentioned, I would encourage you to contact the police or MLSE regarding the scam. I'm not sure MLSE would be too inclined to help you given you acquired the tickets through unofficial methods, but they might be interested in cracking down on the person nonetheless."
tfc,3av5uu,mafiazul,5,Wed Jun 24 00:27:10 2015 UTC,"Isn't there a way to can transfer tickets to another person via ticket master? Any of the games I can't make, I normally sell my ticket, or give away if I'm feeling super nice, but I transfer it via my online TFC account. They send an email to the person who's buying, puts their name on the ticket, and gives them a new barcode. It's then also doesn't enable the original holder to generate new barcodes. Also thinks it protects the buyer from things like this if I remember correctly.  If buying someone's season seats, I'd recommend asking them to do it that way from now on, just to avoid this situation. Bummer it happened though dude. :/"
tfc,3av5uu,matdwyer,5,Wed Jun 24 02:06:04 2015 UTC,You can transfer tickets through the ticket master account. People should go through that method when possible.

I bought 2 tickets off VividSeats.com, realized I could no longer go and then sold them to u/joshuawakefield. We did the transaction over the phone and I gave him all my personal information, even my location of my job. I would not intentionally scam someone for 80 fucking dollars as I've had it happen to me before as well.

tfc,3akonu,FeliusRex,12,Sun Jun 21 03:36:29 2015 UTC,That was a dirty elbow to the back of the head by Andrew Jacobson. What a great game plan... play chippy and dirty. I'm sure that will in no way boomerang back on NYFC players.
tfc,3akonu,errboi,3,Sun Jun 21 09:51:57 2015 UTC,"According to NYCFC fans, Perquis instigated the whole thing by grabbing Jacobson's nuts previously or something."
tfc,3akonu,R00K416,4,Sun Jun 21 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"Was this before or after Perquis got his nose bloodied by an elbow, or when he was hauled down in their box off the corner kick?"
tfc,3akonu,errboi,3,Sun Jun 21 15:23:52 2015 UTC,Couldn't say. That was just some NYCFC fans' justification for the event over on /r/MLS.

tfc,3akc50,DragonicKhaos,20,Sun Jun 21 01:18:39 2015 UTC,Absolute worst performance by a winning team I have ever seen. And also some of the worst refereeing as well. What a shame in the MLS that these refs are the people deciding such important games.
tfc,3akc50,Shlongus,5,Sun Jun 21 01:26:01 2015 UTC,The referee was so fucking dumb
tfc,3akc50,BeanWrap,7,Sun Jun 21 02:46:41 2015 UTC,"I actually thought we looked pretty good overall.  They were gifted two goals. One with terrible luck that often doesn't even get called, and the other our own doing. I think besides that they created a half chance for Diskerud that Konopka smothered fairly comfortably, and that's about it.  We probably had 6-8 chances with 2-3 very good ones. It's a real shame we didn't score in that 10 minute flurry in the first half, probably would have flipped the game on its head.  Looking at how we played instead of the result, I'm not overly concerned. The only thing I think we should be watchful for is our response to teams bunkering in the center of the pitch and inviting pressure. NYCFC gave us the wings for free today, and that's smart of them because it's not our strength. Second time this year we've lost to a bunkering team (first was Houston, but to their credit they created their own goals). So we need to figure out a better response when teams don't actually try to play against us (which I wouldn't be surprised to see more of given how we've torn apart teams that try to match us straight up). Besides that, I was pleased with our play even though it was a frustrating game for obvious reasons. Still created some solid chances, good possession in midfield, and the defense was very solid minus the terrible giveaway leading to their second. We'll be fine."
tfc,3akc50,-notthesun-,2,Sun Jun 21 01:28:04 2015 UTC,"Really? Attacking, I thought we were really flat. Especially in the second half, it looked like we just resorted to cross after cross, and hardly any of them created any real dangerous chances. We did a poor job of getting giovinco in the game too, he was either getting pushed out on the wing or being crossed to in the box vs two massive defenders. I think NY played things perfectly yesterday and we had no ideas or alternatives."
tfc,3akc50,CompletelyUnbaised,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"It wasn't our best day, but it never will be when the other team is parking the bus and clogging the middle for 90 minutes. Like I said, I agree we need to alter our approach somewhat when we face that, but I think we'll win more games than we lose against teams that do this so I'm not panicking or anything. A fair result given the overall play yesterday would have been 0-0, we were just on the end of two really unlucky plays."
tfc,3akc50,-notthesun-,5,Sun Jun 21 15:28:15 2015 UTC,Fuck Oil Money FC and that ref.
tfc,3akc50,Bdog5,4,Sun Jun 21 06:03:42 2015 UTC,"Sure the ref was terrible, NYC were dirty, but what the hell was that pass from Zavaleta? Threw the game away."
tfc,3akc50,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:32:30 2015 UTC,"People have been arguing that zavaleta is better than hagglund because he doesn't give up goals like that.     If zavaleta disagrees stay scoring some then he's no better then hagglund if he starts doing this.    Henry and hagglund both gave goals up, but they put them in the net as well."
tfc,3akc50,notdarren,2,Sun Jun 21 13:05:48 2015 UTC,So frustrating. We were playing well when down a goal but he threw all that momentum away. Never had decent possession afterwards. Also need a plan B for when Gio gets bullied. Moore was a passenger.
tfc,3akc50,ScreamingGerman,4,Sun Jun 21 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"NYCFC figured out that you can stop TFC's attach by not giving Bradley time on the ball, clogging the passing lanes and fouling Giovinco. MLS referees are not going to call all of the fouls that Seba is going to draw. Other opponents are going to watch tapes of this game and we're going to see a lot more of this. Complaining about poor officiating is not going to help. Vanney needs to come up with an alternative strategy when facing this sort of opposition."
tfc,3akc50,mdps,4,Sun Jun 21 15:15:58 2015 UTC,The whole thing reminded me a lot of our season opener against Seattle last year. Seattle were clearly the better team and we fouled the hell out of them to stop them from getting anything going then won with some clinical finishing on the only chances we got in the game. Turnabout is fair play.
tfc,3akc50,errboi,4,Sun Jun 21 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"I was at the game (127 row 14), and by god were some of the refereeing decisions shocking. Villa left a late boot in on Seba when the ball was going out, Altidore dragged down the defender when he was through on goal because the defender was hanging onto him for dear life, the elbow in Perquis back, just shocking.  I was right behind Cheyrou for the penalty, and that was shambolic, that NEVER gets given (especially when you consider he's denied us the exact same call down the other end).   Performance wise, that's the best 90 minute performance we've put in while not taking 3 points in a long long time. Defensively we were actually pretty good, they had no chances bar the peno and the goal, but the second one was a horror show. Zavaleta has to just put his foot through it there instead of trying something cute. Giovinco seemed a little bit off his usual pace (probably the result of the fact that he got clattered every time he tried to make a run, or was dribbling). We did well to generate space wide and get in behind, but the quality of crossing was abysmal, Morgan and Morrow just put their head down and hoped. A couple of well placed cut backs, or balls driven across the face, things could've been very different.   My one major criticism is that when we go through spells of dominance (mins 20-35 ish) we have to make it count. Luke Moore has to finish when he's through 1 v 1, and I'm not sure how we managed to miss the cutback at the near post.   All this being said, it's alright. We're not the finished article yet, but we're getting better."
tfc,3akc50,kierdoyle,17,Sun Jun 21 16:28:53 2015 UTC,"I officially hate NYCFC more than any other MLS team, except Montreal. Plastic club with shit, dirty players, and annoying fans."
tfc,3akc50,Soldado4lyf,6,Sun Jun 21 02:22:06 2015 UTC,After that performance I kind of dislike them even more than Montreal. It doesn't help that they're owned by the Yankees either.
tfc,3akc50,Ontarien,2,Sun Jun 21 05:48:26 2015 UTC,"Are they? I always thought they were owned by the Abu Dhabi group that owns MCFC.  Either way, yeah shit game. Their game plan was to shut us down by any means necessary and they did that well.   It was like watching Allardyces Bolton side at times."
tfc,3akc50,arsenefinger,2,Sun Jun 21 15:09:42 2015 UTC,The Yankees are part owners
tfc,3akc50,Soldado4lyf,15,Sun Jun 21 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"Well, NYCFC is now my least favourite team. Played like a bunch of pricks, I've never been so furious at a performance."
tfc,3akc50,NortonFord,5,Sun Jun 21 01:28:52 2015 UTC,"That really was pathetic. We didn't play as well as we could but they were even worse and happened to score on basically the only chance they got all game. The amount of cheap plays they got away with was ridiculous. Like more than i've ever seen one team get away with in all my years watching footy. Every corner they were fouling somebody in the box, they were bodychecking players on and off the ball, basically every time Giovinco got anywhere near the ball he was getting barged into with no attempt to play the ball (including a few times where he wasnt within 20 yards of the ball) and yet the referee let them get away with the majority of it while booking players like Altidore and Giovinco for such insignificant first fouls.   And then he gifts them a penalty that is never a penalty (and the type of call we didnt get in our last game vs DC, and that we never get) so they can just sit back the whole game defending the lead and fouling the shit out of everyone. Even ignoring how bad he was with the fouls/non-fouls the penalty was an awful call that completely changed the game and gave them the opportunity to park the bus for the rest of the game. It's completely unintentional and Cheyrou gains absolutely no advantage by handling the ball. He is in full possession of the ball with nobody close enough to challenge him. And it's not like it hits his full extended hand or anything like that, it basically hit his bicep which does nothing to give him an advantage compared to it hitting his chest. Never a penalty. I guess that ends the string of decent refereeing we've been getting.  I'm just disappointed because of how pathetic their style was moreso than just losing 3 points. Overall if we play like that creating quality chances and limiting the opposition to 1-2 chances in the entire game we will continue get wins. Can't say the same for them, being thugs the entire game because the referee lets them get away with anything and relying on cheap penalty calls and the hopes that they're going to score the 1-2 chances they can create (and im using the term create loosely, the 2nd goal was Zavaleta gifting them the ball right outside the area)  /long post over"
tfc,3akc50,Menessy27,2,Sun Jun 21 04:26:18 2015 UTC,"Absolute shit refereeing and a lot of poor sportsmanship from NYCFC. I get it, but at least be subtle about it. I mean, how often do you see a keeper get a yellow card for time wasting with what, 20 minutes left in the match   Huge crowd tonight though. I have season tickets in the third last row and they were even full when I arrived. Still easy enough to find another seat but more full than I can remember."
tfc,3akc50,lucastimmons,2,Sun Jun 21 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"Terrible refereeing. NYCFC have some terrible fans who are masters at flair downvoting. Bad performance, but TFC will get em' next time."

Gio was pushed around way out of the way of play multiple times and NYC played with 0 class. It was actually kinda good to see Perquis go off at the end of the game , there was alot of dirty play from their back line and Perquis showed his emotion at the end as much as I don't like seeing players get violent it was a bit nice to see the players were as frustrated as the fans."

tfc,3af2jf,ToffeeUnion_NS,9,Fri Jun 19 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"Danny Koevermans, who will appear in the match prior to TFC’s game against New York City Saturday evening, was unapologetic when he called Toronto FC “the worst team in the world” back in 2012.   Danny was just stating the facts, man. No supporters took offence to this comment at the time."
tfc,3af2jf,mookeddit,5,Fri Jun 19 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"Funny thing about Koef was that his goalscoring pace is still unmatched, I'm pretty sure. Also interesting is that I was talking to the other Danny (Danny the First) about this match and he sort of shook his head and said, ""I don't think he ever played with DeRo"", suggesting a little inter-Danny rivalry...  He also said he's going to be playing at the back in the middle, so that should be funny."

tfc,3a7bzh,DragonicKhaos,5,Wed Jun 17 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"He would be a nice pickup, but how long is it going to take until we realize we need to sign a defender or two especially as Caldwell is aging"
tfc,3a7bzh,QuietDownJunior,2,Wed Jun 17 21:16:09 2015 UTC,"is it necessary though. Morgan has reemerged as a strong option, Morrow is solid or either side. Zavaleta and Hagglund have both been decent, Simonin was great in his one game. Perquis has been good. Bloom is a good RB, he's just been hurt, defense wise, it's actually pretty good by MLS standards. This obsession with signing defensive players serves little purpose."
tfc,3a7bzh,Coramoor_,3,Thu Jun 18 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"Line up those names (Morgan, Morrow, Zavaleta, Hagglund and Simonin) against our midfielders (Giovinco, Bradley, Cheyrou. Warner, Lovitz).  At which position is there more purpose in acquiring talent?"
tfc,3a7bzh,mdps,3,Thu Jun 18 14:02:27 2015 UTC,"The starting midfield is better, depthwise, idk. Also Giovinco isn't a midfielder and quite frankly the defense over the last few games has been quite solid."
tfc,3a7bzh,Coramoor_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"Either way (I agree with R00K416), he's not a defender. I don't see an argument that that's not our weakness. Yes, they've played well for several games, but they've still got a rookie starter and a back playing on the wrong side."
tfc,3a7bzh,mdps,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"Also Giovinco isn't a midfielder   He can play there, and does play there for us when we drop back to a 4-2-3-1 (if Jozy is playing)."

Like the way we got Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore despite not being at the top of the allocation order that returning US internationals are supposed to go through? Or did you just mean the time we signed a 4th DP when we knew we could only have 3 and then they didn't change the rules just for us?

Perquis, Zavaleta, Caldwell, Hagglund the same for central defence. I reckon with this team, status quo is good enough for us, given our salary cap and current players."
tfc,3a7bzh,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:32:14 2015 UTC,"And we have good defenders. You're the one saying the defence isn't good when it has been solid when healthy... And even then what i'm considering ""healthy"" is with Caldwell and Bloom injured who were supposed to be starters.   Since Morrow moved to RB - 5-1-1, 5 goals conceded in 7 games  Since Zavaleta replaced Hagglund - 3-0-0, 2 goals conceded in 3 games (neither one from open play)  Where is the issue?"
tfc,3a7bzh,Menessy27,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:13:08 2015 UTC,I should of stated that I meant not including this year. Because this season is incomplete and defence has been good. But prior seasons not so much.

Remember that the team trains at Downsview which isn't too far away from this facility. Lamport is also far far bigger which may have been something they wanted to avoid. They may also be targeting families and youth soccer groups for cheap games from suburban organizations."
tfc,3a7zlc,Coramoor_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:00:02 2015 UTC,I see OSA would benefit from having the facility their. You raise a good point about about it being cheap and at a sub urban place. I still think as a child it would be a nice match day experience for the children to go to the heart of the city to watch TFC's farm team 10 minutes away from BMO. Think of the Marlies.

Hopefully someone else here has the answer for you. You can also send them a quick email - they're pretty good at replying.
tfc,3a3xxa,notdarren,2,Wed Jun 17 02:15:21 2015 UTC,I've had season seats for 3 years now and although I can get right beside the supporters section I've yet to be able to get into it.    They do it by a list of when you signed up for getting season seats. So the ones that become available every year are no longer available by the time I can change my seats.     I have been told to get friends inside the section and then they'll become available easier but I have yet to befriend anyone enough to pull that favour.   So chances are your first year you won't be in that section.   First few years actually if you don't make the friend.     There are still other great seats for a reasonable price.
tfc,3a3xxa,mdps,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:51:05 2015 UTC,Are you talking 112/113 or the whole south end that you can't get in to?
tfc,3a3xxa,notdarren,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:34:07 2015 UTC,"Any ""Supporters section/standing section"" I can't get into.     Whenever I renew my tickets they're not available. I am told to wait another year."
tfc,3a3xxa,lucastimmons,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:54:40 2015 UTC,"You give them like, $50 paid by credit card as a deposit. When you have decided on your ticket and they go on sale they'll charge you and subtract the $50 from your total.   Then later, just before the season they'll have a relocation period. So if you want to move, that's your time to do so. If the seat you want is available.   If you know anyone who has season tickets make sure to say they referred you and get them the points or whatever. Make sure you have their account number and give it to the person you're dealing with. If you buy two tickets and say, I referred you, I'd get a $200 gift card for food or gear."
tfc,3a3xxa,hurleyburleyundone,0,Wed Jun 17 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"It won't be as difficult as you think, there's a small amount of turnover every year. Find the supporter's group's forums and put out feelers, there are usually one or two ticks that go up every year.   Not sure how new SSH's operate but you'll know the price before they ask for a deposit. You should be able to find out by October-ish."

tfc,39td2o,grabmit,10,Sun Jun 14 16:11:44 2015 UTC,Well the article completely ignores the fact that we've played 9 games on the road and 3 at home. When you're always on the road then yes you're going to concede a bunch of shots to more aggressive home teams and therefore more goals. Being 10th defensively with barely any home games is actually really solid especially considering the defense was battered with injuries in the first 5-6 games.
tfc,39td2o,Menessy27,3,Sun Jun 14 17:24:35 2015 UTC,Interesting stuff. I'd be curious to see analysis of the trends in these indicators in addition to their averages for the season. I would expect those trends to be very positive over the last 5 games.
tfc,39td2o,mdps,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:47:44 2015 UTC,There's got to be a huge uptick there. We weren't terrible to start and have only gotten better. This is an exciting time for tfc fans as we patiently wait for the wheels to come flying off.

tfc,39kq58,discostu81,2,Mon Jun 15 13:38:52 2015 UTC,"What sort of attendance do we all expect for the CanMNT game on Tuesday?  Who's going?  I'm sitting in 113, $25 wasn't too much to pay."
tfc,39kq58,Coramoor_,2,Fri Jun 12 17:03:21 2015 UTC,I'm sitting in 113   I don't think you'll be sitting much! lol
tfc,39hd9s,R00K416,5,Thu Jun 11 18:50:46 2015 UTC,he seems to always look nice when he plays with the US squad
tfc,39hd9s,JLevsssss,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:05:06 2015 UTC,I'm not exactly sure what to make of this statement...
tfc,39hd9s,errboi,6,Fri Jun 12 02:28:38 2015 UTC,i think he plays better with the USMNT than TFC
tfc,39hd9s,JLevsssss,7,Fri Jun 12 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"He's also surrounded by better talent with the USMNT, and up until 3 games ago, he wasn't playing in his proper position at TFC."
tfc,39hd9s,errboi,2,Fri Jun 12 02:51:07 2015 UTC,This. Taking away his deeper defensive responsibilities and allowing him to roam around the midfield (which is essentially what JK does by playing Beckerman behind Bradley) has improved his performances with TFC in the past few weeks. He looks more like he did last season before the double pivot midfield devolved into Bradley playing practically in line with the CBs.
tfc,39hd9s,JLevsssss,4,Fri Jun 12 03:35:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think /u/JLevsssss has been watching the last couple of games very closely.  This goal from like 2 weeks ago is very similar in Bradley finding a man in space with a perfectly weighted ball over the top.  He's been making match altering runs with both the USMNT and with TFC  Bradley is in form right now but you don't notice it with TFC because Seba makes everyone look bad, on both teams."
tfc,39hd9s,errboi,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:12:46 2015 UTC,"I have been watching all the games (Teams so hype right now!) - and I'm not saying Bradley is bad, hes awesome, probably my favourite player on the team...just saying that his impact on the US team seems more significant than on TFC. Like every US game he seems to set up most of the goals...to be fair the quality of TFC is worst than USMNT and starting him as a defensive mid fielder in the first few games of the season probably didnt help...sucks we have to wait a whole nother week for a game"
tfc,39hd9s,BarneyBecker,2,Fri Jun 12 05:16:01 2015 UTC,Is that surprising? He's playing on a better team.

tfc,39gkkl,OtterBurger,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:27:55 2015 UTC,Do we have the salary cap room to bring in another player of quality?
tfc,39gkkl,ScreamingGerman,3,Thu Jun 11 18:09:22 2015 UTC,"Right now, no, but Caldwell and Findley are probably on their way out and that's a huge amount right there."
tfc,39gkkl,OtterBurger,2,Thu Jun 11 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"Since he has started, the defense has been solid. He is obviously not the sole reason, but I believe he is the man for the job."

tfc,39dcnv,ScreamingGerman,4,Thu Jun 11 12:52:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I like the fact that /r/mls has posts about American/Canadian players abroad and the National teams. Bradley is doing excellent in the American friendlies and I would have not known that if it wasn't for the sub."
tfc,39dcnv,iamthelight_,5,Thu Jun 11 15:21:15 2015 UTC,"But it's pretty dumb that you can't post GIFs of great goals/saves/skills/whatever which would seem like one of the main points of a sub like that, but then you're allowed to post 10 transfer rumour posts a day"

tfc,39b4j5,fuzz_boy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:42:46 2015 UTC,Minimum of Giovinco and Bradley as starting 11.  Altidore having been injured a few games hurts his chances but should maybe be a bench player.  I would also put Perquis and Cheyrou as possibles who have been very good.
tfc,39b4j5,quelar,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:38:00 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I'd say Morrow has a strong case for being the best fullback in the league."
tfc,39b9qa,ScreamingGerman,7,Wed Jun 10 16:17:53 2015 UTC,"Now that he's healthy, many supporters have made it clear they want Bendik back in net after Konopka had a poor match against DCU.     really? never see them. Konopka is okay, he's not bad, though not spectacular either. his mistake in the last game (not going forward to punch corner out) isn't that uncommon among MLS goalkeepers either."
tfc,39b9qa,feb914,3,Wed Jun 10 18:05:08 2015 UTC,"Hate? What hate? I've only heard praise for Konopka and his mighty beard. First time I saw him play was against Tottenham and, yes, he was awful then. But since Joe got injured, he's really stepped up. Never heard anything overtly negative about him."
tfc,39b9qa,drretro,2,Thu Jun 11 02:25:10 2015 UTC,"He always seems a bit shaky to me, especially when trying to claim crosses. Can't wait for Big Joe to start again."
tfc,39b9qa,arsenefinger,6,Wed Jun 10 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"I thought Konopka was shaky in his first game and the latest game, but seemed fairly composed and dependable in the others..  And lets not pretend that Bendik is exactly an all-star either, he's had some howlers and still has trouble with his goal kicks.  edit: but where exactly is this ""hate"" coming from? I haven't seen much to be honest."
tfc,39b9qa,section111,3,Wed Jun 10 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"Me neither. No hate, anyway. Sure, he dropped a couple of crosses, but I haven't seen anything else that had me worried. In fact, and I know it mostly has to do with the play of the boys in front of him, but he has one of the best records in the league at the moment.   All that said...I STILL MISS YOU, STEF"
tfc,39b9qa,Makelevi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"The Facebook posts get a fair amount of Konopka hate, but to be fair I think whichever keeper TFC starts always has a huge target for fan complaints.  If People had their way on Facebook we'd be randomly alternating Bono and Roberts, sooooo there's that."
tfc,39b9qa,fuzz_boy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:13:18 2015 UTC,"TFC Facebook fans are pretty bitter, about everything it seems. Tons of negativity and insults where they don't deserve to be."

tfc,39b9qa,iamthelight_,2,Thu Jun 11 14:38:15 2015 UTC,"Konopka is much better. I prefer keepers to come off their line and risk a goal than to stay there when they're not that good at making saves.   Bendik late last season was in good form and making incredible stops.. but this season he was incredibly bland.   Just because Konopka made a couple of poor decisions doesn't meant that he deserves to be crucified. The dude even got GK of the week, if you look at his performance throughout the season... there is no way I'd prefer Bendik."
tfc,39b9qa,mafiazul,2,Wed Jun 10 21:31:36 2015 UTC,Where is the hate coming from? i haven't seen anyone really say anything.
tfc,39b9qa,errboi,2,Thu Jun 11 01:36:44 2015 UTC,There's not really any hate. It's sort of a straw man position for the sake of making an argument. Kinda disappointing.
tfc,39b9qa,Makelevi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:56:46 2015 UTC,I've definitely seen a lot of Konopka hate on Facebook.

When he did attempt a long pass or kick they were poor. Alot of goals come from headers that he should have claimed. In short...good shot stopper, poor distribution, poor on crosses."
tfc,39aieb,ScreamingGerman,6,Wed Jun 10 12:48:12 2015 UTC,What's the record for goals in one season for TFC?    I can only find a combined but not an individual.

tfc,39aieb,LightsCameraRegret,4,Wed Jun 10 13:56:37 2015 UTC,Gio is going to smash that if he keeps up this rate of scoring

tfc,396om5,R00K416,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:43:20 2015 UTC,"they may not be used to his playing style, don't have proper strategy yet. as time goes by, teams start gathering experience and coming up with strategies to handle him. that's why there's ""sophomore slump"", when a player lost their surprise factor and become ""not as invincible"". not saying he will have sophomore slump though, just that he needs to be aware that he won't have free reign for much longer."

tfc,395lmc,lucastimmons,8,Tue Jun 9 15:23:57 2015 UTC,"Haven't single game tickets come close to doubling? I used to pay $20 to sit in the South End, on Saturdays they seem closer to $40."

tfc,395lmc,fuzz_boy,3,Tue Jun 9 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"They won't double it, they will increase it by 15-20% I think. It wouldn't work to their favor to fuck us all that badly, despite it sorta being the way they roll. Even at it's peak, my season ticket was only a bit above double what it is now, if I remember correctly.    If we won the cup? I could see double, or more."
tfc,395lmc,lucastimmons,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:36:37 2015 UTC,"It just seems to me they should probably apologize for taking so long to get to the playoffs and offer the tickets at the same price as the regular season. At least for this year, assuming we make the playoffs.   I just don't see it happening. 15%-20% might be a little low. Realistically I think 20%-25%. But I'd be happy if you were right."
tfc,395lmc,fuzz_boy,2,Tue Jun 9 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"It should take a lot of thought on their part, I know people that won't accept a 25% increase, regardless of having made the playoffs.

tfc,395lmc,R00K416,5,Tue Jun 9 16:01:33 2015 UTC,"We're paying season one prices,  in a stadium renovated to the tune of 9 figures, to watch multi-million dollar talent. Sure, MLSE has had no shortage of fuck-ups concerning TFC, but it's unfair to say they've gouged us."

Plus, all three games are at home, and two are against teams at the bottom of the league, though Montreal looks pretty good at the moment.  I'd like to see us start a mostly full strength lineup, with some younger players mixed in for all three games.  Seven points from 3 games should be pretty doable.  We can't worry about Giovinco getting injured.  Yeah, he's the best player in the league.  Yeah, MLSE put all of our eggs in 3 baskets; that's the way MLS operates.  Gio is no good to us injured, but he's no good to us on the bench either.  I say we play him as often as any other player.  If he feels fit, let's start him for 3 games."
tfc,39164z,FlyingCarsArePlanes,4,Mon Jun 8 16:16:00 2015 UTC,Isn't this normal for European teams in a regular CL/domestic football schedule? Pretty sure Gio can handle it regardless.
tfc,39164z,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, they do.. and that's one of the reasons they have a high injury rate.

tfc,38uvvd,Menessy27,3,Mon Jun 8 00:46:49 2015 UTC,Konopka's positioning was bad when we conceded. he should have stormed out and try to punch the ball out. instead he was undecided and caught in no man's land.
tfc,38uvvd,feb914,3,Sun Jun 7 02:41:24 2015 UTC,"I think Zavaleta could have got something on the ball but he sort of ducked out of the way.  After that, Perquis shouldn't have let his man get in front of him."

Osorio should have put that in and there were a few other near-goals.  Konopka forgot he wasn't Neuer.  The announcers on sn360 were much better than Kristian Jack and whoever else we normally get.  Jackson was pretty clutch late game, just needs to pass more."

tfc,38uwsn,ExProxy,11,Sun Jun 7 01:07:48 2015 UTC,Remember a month ago when people were calling for him to be sacked and I told everyone to calm down?  ARE WE CALM YET?

tfc,38uwsn,notdarren,5,Sun Jun 7 01:18:43 2015 UTC,"Zavaleta played well though (at least in the games i watched).    he may not be the perfect manager, but he's a rookie (his first full season) and he seems to have potential. we need consistency, we can't pull a Real (sadly, my favourite team) and change coach every so often."

tfc,38qtll,Soldado4lyf,2,Sat Jun 6 03:43:28 2015 UTC,"This week was actually the first time DC scored more than 2 goals in 15 games (with 9 home games). In comparison we've done it 3 times in 13 games (only 4 at home) so it looks like this will be a low scoring game because they don't score that often. If we can follow the type of game we've played in our last 3 road matches (2W1D0L, scorelines of 1-0 1-0 1-1) as well as our last two home games (1-0 and 1-0) where we gave up pretty much no chances then we could possibly sneak a low scoring win if our defense doesn't concede many chances. They do have Espindola back though who's their best attacker but their strength seems to be in their defense and defensive mid Kitchen and not their attack.  Also Bloom, Altidore and Warner all travelled with the team and might play. That only leaves Caldwell and Lovitz out with Findley and Bendik returning to the bench last week"

tfc,38ohre,TastyTacoTonight,3,Fri Jun 5 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"As an American (and honorary Canadian according to my Canadian relatives), I am genuinely surprised how far Canada has ""fallen."" Here is what I have to say as an outsider with a tremendous amount of sympathy.  Playing in the second round of World Cup qualifying is honestly pretty embarrassing. However, all of this being said, I think there are a load of positives.  First of all, I think everyone can agree that the reason for why Canada's ranking is so embarrassing is because the level of talent its players have has not matched with results in recent years.  Here's a really important fact. Results are not as important as developing talent, at least not in the long run. Coaches, tactics etc  can be fixed in the short term, an institutional lack of talent cannot.  The amount of talent coming out of Canada is certainly on the rise. There are more youth and developmental leagues than ever and it's not far removed from its own professional league, which likely will not match the MLS ever, but that's fine because Canadian teams won't be leaving the MLS anytime soon (especially since we're going to fucking win the MLS Cup this year!).  I mean, just look at the TFC talent. Osorio is only 22 and oozes potential, while Henry has (sadly) already left for bigger and better things in Europe. I think Morgan would be quite serviceable as well in most mid-lower end Championship teams and is likely to have a solid career in MLS and the national team. And that's without even mentioning Hamilton.  It stinks that guys like Rosario are retiring and other highly talented players (Hoilett...) do not seem to want to play for Canada for whatever reason. This contrasts greatly with the U.S., where 1/4 of our team are hired mercenaries from Germany and Mexico (I kid, sort of). But you know what, with Akindele, the tide seems to finally be turning here.  I genuinely believe that right now will literally be the lowest point in Canadian soccer for a long time if not forever. I mean, Canada is miles ahead of where the U.S. was say 20 years ago.   In 20 years or so more time, there's no doubt Canada, the U.S. and Mexico are all going to be soccer titans constantly beating the shit out of each other.   When that day finally comes, the whole world will be humbled before the behemoth that is CONCACAF soccer.   It seems quite awhile away, but I for one, cannot wait."

tfc,38ohre,goonerdavid,-7,Sat Jun 6 06:43:38 2015 UTC,"Never has and never will be good. Any quality Canadian player (Begovic, de Guzman, Bono) will always seek out to player for a different nationality. Take it as you will, but this is the truth. I'm Canadian but would never take an interest in Canadian soccer because of how poor it is."
tfc,38ohre,brucelives,6,Fri Jun 5 15:45:37 2015 UTC,"We need more people like you in the Canadian soccer community. ""Its always going to be shit, why bother"""
tfc,38ohre,goonerdavid,-2,Fri Jun 5 15:58:18 2015 UTC,"What? Realistic people who have grown up going through the Canadian soccer system? How many quality Canadian players are produced per year and make it in Europe? Not many. We just don't have the right programs in place to pump out quality players. So to answer the question, obviously there isn't much of a future. I would be happy to be proved wrong."
tfc,38ohre,mookeddit,4,Fri Jun 5 16:26:33 2015 UTC,"We just don't have the right programs in place to pump out quality players.   How about the Canadian MLS academy programs that have only been up and running a few years? Programs are in place, it's just going to take a while to catch up, but at least there's ways now for kids to progress into professional soccer in Canada and further their training at a younger level."
tfc,38ohre,brucelives,4,Fri Jun 5 16:43:01 2015 UTC,World class academies at that.
tfc,38ohre,killgod2121,2,Fri Jun 5 16:49:15 2015 UTC,"The foundation is being laid to help create more professionals from Canada.  The addition of MLS clubs (w/academy's competing globally at all levels), NASL clubs and the predicted 2017 launch of a 2nd tier all Canadian league are the building blocks.  It will still take time, but growth is being put into place.  Compare today to a decade ago and we've come incredibly far.  Where will we sit in another 10 years?  Looks even brighter.  Obviously there isn't much of a future?  Not to sure I agree.  We're seeing improvement and WC berths at the youth levels.  There's a large group of young players with potential that will be the core of what pushes forward towards the 2022 WC.    Can't imagine you know much about the country's program/agenda since you're so willing to dismiss, or be oblivious to, what's actually happening."
tfc,38ohre,goonerdavid,2,Fri Jun 5 16:42:43 2015 UTC,Personally I disagree and I think that as the MLS and the national team start to improve more and more will pledge allegiance with our country.

tfc,38ohre,goonerdavid,5,Fri Jun 5 16:28:59 2015 UTC,"By improving the league in which the Canadian players are most likely to end up in, you don't see that directly impacting the quality of Canadian players?"
tfc,38mqa3,DC4SHEEZY,3,Fri Jun 5 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"1) Worst in my opinion is the back line... They have improved significantly over the last few games, as we've started getting some consistency (Morrow getting used to the switch to RB, Morgan stepping up at LB, Zavaleta shaking off the rust).  But I still think that would be the biggest weakness at the moment.  2) I'd say the Zavaleta/ Perquis partnership at CB is interesting enough to keep an eye on. I was very impressed with how those two handled Jahn and Wondo from SJ last weekend. Both are physical enough, and are well timed in the air.  3) I love Bradley. Toronto fans have (justified) extremely high expectations for him, so when he doesn't have a supurb game, people get on his case... But I think some ppl forget that even an avg game from him is well above par.  Last few games he's been playing at the level we expected when he first signed tho.  He's pure heart, and a great captain.  4) I was thrilled with the Altidore signing. Not everyone cuts it in the EPL. Doesn't mean they can't excell elsewhere.  MLS is a perfect level for Jozy to dominate, as you say his physical play is key to his attack. With guys like Bradley and Gio feeding him, he will get several chances a game. 4 goals in 6 is a fine start.  Enjoy the match, I have a lot of respect for DC."
tfc,38mqa3,juanroberto,2,Fri Jun 5 13:40:04 2015 UTC,"1) the best thing about TFC is the attack. We've developed a patient buildup, but we're also dangerous on the counter. The worst? People are still complaining about the back line, but it's really tightened up over the last 4 or so games. I suppose dealing with balls into the box is still a sore spot?  2) Sticking with that defense question, watch to see how many of the DC attacks look dangerous. I know they're on a real tear right now, but we've been so good lately, the other team's have been largely ineffectual going forward. I think that has a lot to do with Cheyrou. He's a real hero of this team for me. Along with Morrow.   3) Love Bradley. Fantastic captain, awesome all over the place. It drives me nuts when people get on him.   4) It's a real shame about Jozy's injury. We can only wonder what it would've been like with him firing on all cylinders along with Seba in his recent form. Great start though. Looking forward to his return.   This is going to be a great match. We'll be missing a key player or two, but I think you will be too. Can't wait!"
tfc,38mqa3,section111,2,Fri Jun 5 14:08:53 2015 UTC,"Watch for Cheyrou.  With Bradley out, we will be looking to him for stability and experience in midfield.  Morrow has also been playing very well lately, look for him joining attacks.  I'm also quite excited to see Chapman out there, I thought he looked quite good out there vs Man City, curious to see how he'll respond if he gets the start tomorrow.  Not sure if he will, but he's an exciting up and coming prospect."

He's playing great but is making some blunders at the very last step of the process, when the ball needs to get to the back of the net. He is a great player, and a Canadian to boot, so he is a favorite of mine. I'd love to see him score a couple of goals soon, since I can't imagine his confidence isn't waning slightly."

MLS may not be Serie A or La Liga (give it another decade or two), but if we can have guys like Seba come through every once in a while, then life is good.  Best of luck to you guys."
tfc,382epz,thetonyhightower,2,Mon Jun 1 13:48:39 2015 UTC,"The only obstacle MLS will eventually have to overcome is the lack of other good leagues near by. At the end of the day the top talent is in Europe for the Champions League, not the individual national leagues and honestly I think that's the hardest for MLS to catch up to since it has nothing to do with them."
tfc,382epz,thetonyhightower,4,Mon Jun 1 17:38:29 2015 UTC,"That's true. The only way to overcome that is with all the other factors: exposure, money, American-style fame (which is different from England/Spain/Italy/Germany or Argentina/Brazil), and the prestige of MLS being an (eventual) top-tier-ish league where the best play against the best.  MLS won't, couldn't and shouldn't try to replace the Premiership or the Bundesliga, but there's potentially enough money and opportunity here that as it continues to improve & the salaries continue to grow, it'll attract a certain kind of player. It's a big world, and this will be just another, hopefully increasingly attractive, option."

There is already an attempt at a world wide CL, the Club World Cup, played between the winners of the CLs in each region. The problem is the long distances and the relatively small financial incentives involved usually cause the European teams not to care and field less than optimal sides. If the rest of the world's leagues could get TV deals at the level of Europe this could maybe become better, but this is even harder than making the MLS good since you'd need Asian leagues and African leagues to generally improve greatly, which again the MLS has no control over.  EDIT: Changed USA to MLS to more accurately represent my statement."
tfc,382epz,mdps,4,Tue Jun 2 05:53:31 2015 UTC,"As a Juve fan in Southern Ontario (and also TFC supporter since day 1) I was beyond excited by the signing of Gio. I've always liked him as a player. From what I've seen of him, he has a great attitude and plays with heart. He is incredibly skilled and in MLS he is in a tier by himself. He did have a lot of hype initially, but I do understand how nerves can seriously affect performance. I think he did better at Parma but there was still a lot of pressure with the title of being the next Del Piero. It also didn't help to be playing in Juve on a team where you're a sub for some of the best players in the world.   I hope his success in Toronto continues and grows. There is a lot of love for him in Toronto. I hope he feels it and continues with the effort he has been putting forth so far.   I'm looking forward to this saturday. It's a full day (hopefully full of win) with Juve playing the CL final, TFC@DC, and then Canadian women's first game of the Women's World Cup (gotta support the women's team cuz they're our only strong squad at the world level)"
tfc,382epz,mdps,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:40:25 2015 UTC,"I completely agree! I didn't go into it but he had two major drawbacks. The first was the era, the late 2000s and early 2010s saw a huge increase in physicality in football. Defenders got bigger and physical dominance was generally allowed by the refs in this era (famous players like Messi and Iniesta generally got protected though). He was just too small to take a shove from larger more physical players, which caused him to look bad. IMHO even Baggio would have suffered in this era.   The second problem he had was Conte. Conte's system was effective (especially in Serie A) but generally was miserable for strikers. Of all the strikers Juventus had in Conte's three years, only Tevez and to some degree Llorente ever really managed to put up half decent numbers. I mean for two of those years midfielders tended to score as much or more than any strikers we had. Gio was never good at playing with his back toward goal, he's too small. So his last three years at Juventus basically were a waste since Conte's system was just toxic for him."

They have a team that is essentially playing for the title of ""best team in the world"" this weekend. Their players are among the best in the world and their system obviously works. Seba is tremendously talented and in MLS he is in unmatched. He just didn't realistically have a consistent starting role at Juve, and he needs to be playing starter minutes to be at his best. I'm glad they realized that and let him go to TFC where he can get the play that he wants instead of riding the pine at Juve"

tfc,37w7r7,lamycnd,1 point,Sun May 31 13:48:23 2015 UTC,Vanney said before the game he wanted the fullbacks to push higher. I don't think it had anything to do with Creavalle. That left side is dominating though when Morgan pushes up
tfc,37wn2f,DragonicKhaos,17,Sun May 31 00:38:59 2015 UTC,"In 5 seasons of regularly going to BMO Field, that was without a shadow of a doubt the best performance I have seen from our team.  Top to bottom, an outstanding display of teamwork and effort.  If we play like this every week, no concern about play-offs...we should be serious contenders for the title."
tfc,37wn2f,discostu81,11,Sun May 31 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"You can tell the team is starting to really gel when you get such huge contributions from guys like Creavalle, Morrow, and Moore. Doesn't matter that we have guys playing out of position, or bench players filling in, we got results."
tfc,37wn2f,R00K416,6,Sun May 31 01:01:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it's a level of confidence and belief in each other that we're not used to at TFC...and it will continue to get us results if we can keep it up."
tfc,37wn2f,discostu81,1 point,Sun May 31 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"There was one moment where things looked utterly awful:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSb14kW2P7k&t=1m50s  Look at the defenders in the slow motion replay - all standing still.  But other than that, super fun game to watch."
tfc,37wn2f,ekdaemon,1 point,Sun May 31 17:28:09 2015 UTC,"True, that was heart in the mouth stuff.  But it seemed to wake them up at least."
tfc,37wn2f,discostu81,1 point,Sun May 31 17:46:10 2015 UTC,I don't know if anyone else agrees but I don't think Zavaleta has it yet and I think he's only getting a start above Hagglund because he's Vanney's nephew.      Hagglund only did bad at right back one game.  He's much better in the centre.
tfc,37wn2f,notdarren,10,Mon Jun 1 18:02:47 2015 UTC,Majestic performance all around today.
tfc,37wn2f,kilod3lta,5,Sun May 31 00:58:19 2015 UTC,Good fucking shit boys. Of course I miss a high scoring game like that.
tfc,37wn2f,TorontoFC15,5,Sun May 31 02:21:56 2015 UTC,Sould have been 7 or 8!
tfc,37wn2f,discostu81,5,Sun May 31 02:25:36 2015 UTC,Seba deserved a brace - crazy to think he was still involved in all of our other goals.
tfc,37wn2f,Makelevi,3,Sun May 31 04:11:21 2015 UTC,Excellent. But wasn't anyone else nervous early in the second half when we retreated into our half and couldn't gain possession? Glad they got that counter-attack working.
tfc,37wn2f,mdps,2,Sun May 31 12:13:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some people claimed they were ""sitting on their heels"", but to me it looked more like they couldn't hold nor keep posession and thus there was all this play in their own end around the box - very dangerous, that's not ""sitting on your heels"", that's being ""back on your heels"" :)"
tfc,37wn2f,ekdaemon,2,Sun May 31 17:29:57 2015 UTC,SJ came out playing their best and most aggressive to start the 2nd half to be fair. But as we have done since we moved to the diamond we basically gave up no real chances. Then after about 15mins of SJ's best player it looked like they got discouraged they couldnt score and we completely took over on the counter
tfc,37wn2f,Menessy27,1 point,Sun May 31 17:55:14 2015 UTC,Agreed that we gave up little in terms of real opportunities. But better teams will punish us if we keep that up.

tfc,37wn2f,drretro,1 point,Sun May 31 03:04:09 2015 UTC,"I was impressed with Zavaleta. Looks utterly unlike the guy we saw in the early games. He must have really impressed in training to get ahead of Hagglund. Other than almost losing his cool at one point, he played very well."

tfc,37w839,Makelevi,1 point,Sun May 31 04:08:22 2015 UTC,My favourite part of this replay is the guy who dove had to watch it from his knees.
tfc,37w839,mdps,2,Sun May 31 00:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yup. Nyassi played that like the striker he is, thinking he would get the call."

tfc,37vs7n,colour157,1 point,Sun May 31 00:45:29 2015 UTC,The east side lower level and south side concourses were awful. You'd hardly know that part of the stadium is covered! But we found that the upper level concourse on the east side was dry and not at all crowded. No lines at concessions or washrooms.
tfc,37vs7n,mdps,4,Sun May 31 12:18:52 2015 UTC,"Yikes.  Consider parking on the north side of the GO tracks, in Liberty village.  I've never failed to find a spot on or around Atlantic Ave."

tfc,37vs7n,burtxn,2,Sun May 31 05:31:02 2015 UTC,"It's because the city, who owns part of bmo, signed a new contract to let them expand but also cut the city out of the field revenues. They now make most of their money through parking.  Thank our old mayor."

tfc,37nznv,Soldado4lyf,3,Fri May 29 04:41:00 2015 UTC,I like it. Gets my vote for sure.
tfc,37nznv,supportingTFC,3,Fri May 29 09:55:00 2015 UTC,"who's chapman? jeez i take one week off from following closely and now we're starting hamilton over moore, zavelata over hagglund, and chapman over warner?"
tfc,37nznv,section111,7,Fri May 29 13:21:06 2015 UTC,"people are a little excited from the City match, but no, Chapman will not be starting. Warren Creavalle did very well, he'll play. Same with Moore. Not so sure about Hagglund though..."
tfc,37nznv,Soldado4lyf,3,Fri May 29 14:42:28 2015 UTC,"If you don't know who Chapman is, you've taken more than one week off. Anyway, Warner's injured, and Hamilton deserves to start over Moore"
tfc,37nznv,supportingTFC,2,Fri May 29 15:10:29 2015 UTC,"like I've heard of him, but he has 0 minutes of playing time according to TFC website..."
tfc,37nznv,kilod3lta,8,Fri May 29 19:10:08 2015 UTC,my first TFC game of the season!   so excited.
tfc,37nznv,theIG88,5,Fri May 29 10:48:18 2015 UTC,Enjoy man! Always awesome attending you first game!
tfc,37nznv,a_lumberjack,1 point,Fri May 29 11:15:11 2015 UTC,...aaaaand it may not even happen.
tfc,37nznv,R00K416,6,Sat May 30 20:54:50 2015 UTC,Konopka  Morrow -  Perquis - Zavaleta - Morgan       Warner - Cheyrou - Osorio                     Bradley      Giovinco - Hamilton  Hamilton found more chances against City than Moore has all season. You've got to reward the kid. The rest is unchanged from last weekend.
tfc,37nznv,supportingTFC,3,Fri May 29 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"Warner is week-to-week with a hamstring injury. Creavalle likely to start in his absence, with Jackson as another option."
tfc,37nznv,Kyrickell,3,Fri May 29 03:26:17 2015 UTC,zavaleta over Hagglund?
tfc,37nznv,mdps,2,Fri May 29 03:30:05 2015 UTC,"Zavaleta started last weekend against Portland.  Clean sheet.  He had a quiet game iirc, which is what you want from your center back."
tfc,37nznv,a_lumberjack,1 point,Fri May 29 10:51:04 2015 UTC,"Against Portland, who had only scored once in their 4 previous matches.   I like Zavaleta and expect he'll develop nicely. But TFC has a history of athletic young defenders showing early promise and then getting exposed for their inexperience."
tfc,37nznv,Menessy27,2,Sat May 30 11:34:40 2015 UTC,"He's got the pace Hagglund doesn't have. That's critical paired with Perquis. The best CB partnerships mix pace and strength (think Vidic/Ferdinand, Mertesacker/Koscielny, etc)."
tfc,37nznv,a_lumberjack,1 point,Fri May 29 12:02:47 2015 UTC,"By found more chances you mean missed easy chances? how is having the ball put on a plate for you and missing impressive? Hamilton hasn't scored in ages in the USL and couldn't score vs a City B team in the 2nd half, that wasn't putting in any effort, even with the ball put on a plate for him. Why not start Aparicio in the midfield while we're at it then? Let's stop hyping Hamilton when he's done absolutely nothing..."
tfc,37nznv,Coramoor_,3,Fri May 29 16:39:02 2015 UTC,The best chance was about confidence. He had time to take a touch and forced it. The other was a solid stop on a tough angle.  Whereas Moore is the invisible man.
tfc,37nznv,rickyforr,2,Fri May 29 19:24:55 2015 UTC,the difference is that Hamilton is able to get the chances even if some of his play is questionable and he is clearly a bit snakebit at the moment. There is not a huge selection at forward right now and Hamilton deserves a couple run outs to see what he can do in MLS.
tfc,37nznv,supportingTFC,7,Fri May 29 20:21:18 2015 UTC,"Konopka   Morrow,   Perquis,  Zavaleta,  Morgan Jackson,  Cheyrou,  Bradley,  Osorio       Moore          Gio  I still don't know why people are saying Hamilton deserves a start. He's scored once in 6 games for TFC II. Moore has more experience and actually made a meaningful contribution to our last win. If Hamilton plays he should come in as a sub and prove he is better than Moore."
tfc,37nznv,mdps,7,Fri May 29 15:47:10 2015 UTC,Konopka        Morrow  Perquis  Hagglund  Morgan                    Cheyrou       Osorio                   Jackson                   Bradley              Giovinco                        Moore
tfc,37nznv,discostu81,4,Fri May 29 13:23:43 2015 UTC,Disappointing forecast. After all this great weather I'd hoped to keep the Gore-Tex in the closet today.

tfc,37nznv,Menessy27,1 point,Fri May 29 14:43:24 2015 UTC,"Feels nice to be confident though San Jose shouldn't be underestimated, they're in a good run of form themselves being unbeaten in their last 5 and all"

tfc,37nznv,R00K416,1 point,Sat May 30 20:58:49 2015 UTC,We should beat San Jose at home... we finally have a steady lineup that's playing well. Too bad we have yet another injury in Warner now but the play from the young guys vs City makes me feel better about our depth even though we currently have quite a few injuries
tfc,37nznv,Xstasy14,1 point,Fri May 29 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"As long as Dike doesn't come on, Im happy. Unless we're up 3 in extra time...then sure."

tfc,37lqgd,jztrumpeter,5,Thu May 28 15:23:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think using him for 30 minutes in Montreal would really be effective.      If he plays that 30 minutes and there's no goals scored, we play him longer and chance tiring him or injuring him.       Or you've wasted a sub 30 minutes into the game, with an hour left to play and hold a lead/tie or take the chance on no one getting injured if you make a 60th minute sub.       He played 30 minutes in a game that no one was ever going to be giving 100% in.    I wouldn't be too upset."
tfc,37lqgd,notdarren,4,Thu May 28 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"I meant put him on around the 60th minute and give him the rest of the game.  There's always a chance of injury, even in friendlies where players aren't giving 100%."
tfc,37lqgd,notdarren,2,Thu May 28 15:32:04 2015 UTC,"I thought of the 60th minute after I hit send.     And there is always a chance of injury but there's no chance he'll get injured in a game he isn't playing.       I'm not saying I agree he should have been played yesterday, but out of the two options I would say focus on the league, and play him in that friendly.       Given the choice, I would still not play him in the cup game, and not have the friendly at all.   I think right now making play-offs is far more important for Vanney than anything else."
tfc,37lqgd,section111,3,Thu May 28 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"Playoffs are the goal no doubt, but Montreal won the cup and made the playoffs with a much worse squad than we have now.  It's just disappointing that we aren't showing as much ambition when it comes to the Voyageurs cup the past few years."
tfc,37lqgd,Xstasy14,4,Thu May 28 15:42:27 2015 UTC,"It's just disappointing that we aren't showing as much ambition when it comes to the Voyageurs cup the past few years.   I know what you're saying, but on the flip side, we've won the thing 4 times and no one gives a fuck. Everyone refers to TFC as 8+ years of barren winlessness, completely ignoring those 4 trophies."
tfc,37lqgd,section111,2,Thu May 28 16:29:46 2015 UTC,"Similar to when the NHL was only 6 teams..its not really that impressive when you think about it. Although I do love group stage in the CONCAF champions league, cool seeing teams play you normally wouldn't be able to."
tfc,37lqgd,Xstasy14,1 point,Thu May 28 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"Similar to when the NHL was only 6 teams   ...or like the CFL, always? ;-) But yeah, I love the Champions League. A cup night is super exciting. Although I do think it's right that, this year, we try to focus on at least making the playoffs with this team."
tfc,37lqgd,mookeddit,2,Thu May 28 18:42:43 2015 UTC,That should always be the focus to start the season. I don't mind seeing the kids play tournament/friendlies. Tons of teams use that same strategy.   Hell even nights when I don't have to work Ill try and watch TFC II against random american teams I never even heard of. Its pretty fun.
tfc,37lqgd,Coramoor_,3,Thu May 28 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"People expect to see at least a glimpse of the better players on either side. I'm not one who supports having these midseason, but that's why people go."
tfc,37lqgd,Coramoor_,2,Thu May 28 16:24:51 2015 UTC,"The first leg was in Montreal and they didn't want him to travel, it is quite different really. Plus you need to showcase for the fans who came to see Man City what TFC has to offer"
tfc,37lqgd,Coramoor_,2,Thu May 28 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"For what we're paying him, I think he should be able to put up with a one hour flight."
tfc,37lqgd,Xstasy14,1 point,Thu May 28 18:47:53 2015 UTC,"it's not about the flight, it's about everything that goes around with that type of thing. It is a lot easier on his body recovery wise to get in a car, play 30 minutes, do his routine and sleep in his own bed then doing all of the travel related elements"
tfc,37lqgd,iamthelight_,2,Thu May 28 18:49:29 2015 UTC,It's not going to kill him to play two games a week every once in a while.
tfc,37lqgd,a_lumberjack,1 point,Thu May 28 18:56:08 2015 UTC,sure but that wasn't the plan of the trip or of how they wanted to use him
tfc,37lqgd,warpus,1 point,Thu May 28 19:02:16 2015 UTC,"Probably similar to how a lot of Premier teams find the FA cup now, use cup games to give youth a chance, keep your super stars fresh for the league. Not a bad decision overall, but it goes to show that TFC really needs to emphasize having a deep roster, with players ready to fill voids when called upon."
tfc,37lqgd,a_lumberjack,2,Thu May 28 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"Disagree. No matter how much we are paying Giovinco, he is a human and can get injured and fatigue. We have almost all of our eggs in his basket and it was not worth flying him to montreal and risking over-working him. I also disagreed with playing him yesterday, but it was a home game and it wasn't a competitive one.   Just remember that we need Giovinco healthy all 34 games. It's not worth risking that just so he could have played that one match."
tfc,37lqgd,warpus,2,Fri May 29 00:45:27 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, you can't play the guy five times in 15 days. That's how you get overuse injuries. You have to rotate and rest. The away leg was the right time for that. Even Bradley, who hates to miss anything, only played 60 minutes.  Play for the draw away, go for the win at home with the big guns. It's a common strategy in  cup ties. And it almost worked."
tfc,37lqgd,a_lumberjack,1 point,Fri May 29 12:29:34 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling there might have been some direction coming from above to Vanney - ""Our available star players have to be out there for at least a little while"".  It's an exhibition game, so I wouldn't be surprised - the FO (and/or ownership?) wants our club to come out looking well, and that includes putting our best players on display.  That or I wouldn't really even be surprised if Giovinco himself requested to play against Manchester City for a little while.  When you're a player, you want to play against the best.  Might have been an opportunity he didn't want to pass up.  Either way, I don't mind that we're out of the Canadian Championship.  It would have been nice to win, but now we can focus on the league.  I don't mind that at all.  Let some other Canadian team worry about having to travel to central America.  We can worry about trying to win the Champions League after we've made the playoffs at least once.  We need to focus on this, or else we're going to continue being labelled as ""the team that can't""."
tfc,37lqgd,hurleyburleyundone,2,Thu May 28 19:49:27 2015 UTC,Just like how city brought Aguero and Zabaleta. These things have requirements in place contractually.
tfc,37lqgd,ourkid17,1 point,Fri May 29 12:22:31 2015 UTC,And if so I sort of love Vanney for taking off Giovinco so early.  I'm sure at least some of the higher ups would have preferred form him to stay on at least until halftime.
tfc,37lqa6,BanksKnowsBest,6,Thu May 28 15:21:49 2015 UTC,i really don't see why the NASL should be going to areas with MLS teams already. Hit markets that don't have teams.
tfc,37lqa6,mafiazul,3,Thu May 28 16:15:25 2015 UTC,"We are home to the worlds biggest hockey market and yet no one goes to see Marlies games. I don't see why anyone would go to an NASL game with TFC in town.  I don't think Toronto supports lower leagues as a whole. Then again, the Argos have a fanbase so what do I know?"
tfc,37lqa6,R00K416,2,Thu May 28 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"I partially agree, I would go to a TFC II game, if it happened to fit in my schedule, whereas I plan around TFC games now."

That said, NASL is not the AHL. Not a lot of future stars playing there. Hamilton would work, Toronto less so."
tfc,37lqa6,a_lumberjack,3,Sat May 30 14:12:34 2015 UTC,"Toronto already has an MLS team, a USL-Pro team, and a PDL team (plus I think a couple L1O teams?). Does it really need another one?"

tfc,37jf2w,DragonicKhaos,6,Thu May 28 01:42:41 2015 UTC,Losing 1-0 with the majority of our starters out and the fact we created quality chances and should have scored at least one and everyone left the game healthy? complete success for TFC

Hamilton though...looking forward to seeing how he progresses."
tfc,37jf2w,Xstasy14,3,Thu May 28 12:09:32 2015 UTC,"Would have been an awesome goal, the backheel, fake cross then pinpoint one to the striker for a free header..."
tfc,37jf2w,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Thu May 28 12:35:55 2015 UTC,Seriously. It's one thing to not score and another to barely even touch the ball and have it weakly dribble wide... and this is a big guy who you'd think would be good in the air. He just dented his hopes of playing time for TFC thats for sure

I didn't see much if any panic out there, that was really good to see.   Sure, it was just a friendly, but I think a couple years ago even our starting 11 would have been at least slightly intimidated.  The future seems bright."
tfc,37jf2w,warpus,2,Thu May 28 13:45:07 2015 UTC,Terrible timing too the crowd was just waking up and getting in on a massive TFC chant as a whole. This sure silenced us!
tfc,37fpc1,R00K416,3,Wed May 27 08:08:14 2015 UTC,"curious, what is the man bra thingy Chapman (?) is wearing?"
tfc,37fpc1,soooeasyjoe,2,Wed May 27 14:07:04 2015 UTC,It seems to be some sort of weighted vest.  Not entirely sure though.

tfc,37c9gg,PrawnSolo,9,Tue May 26 16:25:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like if people come to Portland, they want to consume as much high quality beer as possible, so it's probably like that. I consumed as much poutine as possible. Well, I take that back, I didn't buy one at BMO. Probably bc I was running low on cash since beer is $11.50... :/  Alexander Keith's IPA and Cascade Hop Pale are  nice little options you all have. I'd drink them on the regular."
tfc,37c9gg,iferraro,1 point,Tue May 26 17:34:43 2015 UTC,"Glad you had a good time in our great city. Agreed on everything except the Alexander Keith's IPA (read lager). Visited the Pacific Northwest recently and was blown away by the variety and selection of local craft beer. I learned that it is the number 2 hop growing region in the world. Such a beautiful region, you are lucky to live there."
tfc,37c9gg,PagingDrFreeman,6,Thu May 28 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"Was travelling a few weeks ago down in Louisville, KY for my bachelor party and met a couple Timbers fans while out. They represented the Timbers fan base well - passionate, dedicated, kind, and great sportsmanship.  Loved seeing you guys at BMO - small but strong. Nothing but respect for all you Timbers fans out there! Glad you had a great time."
tfc,37c9gg,mookeddit,6,Tue May 26 17:42:58 2015 UTC,We didn't have the MC logo in our CSS... that one just seemed appropriate.  Glad you enjoyed your time here and experienced all of the poutine we have to offer.
tfc,37c9gg,warpus,4,Tue May 26 16:18:19 2015 UTC,"If I'm ever in Portland and want to indulge in the local poutine equivalent that isn't beer, what do you recommend?"
tfc,37c9gg,quelar,6,Tue May 26 19:33:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, anything farm-to-table is going to be choice. We have some insane food here. Food carts aplenty...  Unless it's really not your thing, or you're not (USA, 21) old enough, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not having some of our world-class beers."
tfc,37c9gg,quelar,6,Tue May 26 21:36:47 2015 UTC,You just made me think of portlandia and one of the first sketches with the chicken named colin.  Glad you enjoyed. Come again but warn us next time and some of us will take you out for some beers.

tfc,37dvks,ExProxy,2,Wed May 27 12:31:18 2015 UTC,I'd join you but I can't make this weeks game.  We should get an /r/TFC meetup organized for a game this season though. Maybe one of the Supporter's Section groups could help us find enough tickets in the same section? I'm sure a few of us are members but I love the idea of bringing new people as a group to experience it for the first time. I didn't become a diehard fan until my first experience with the RPB.  Edit: even an away game viewing at a pub would be cool.

tfc,37cvq1,-notthesun-,9,Tue May 26 18:25:52 2015 UTC,"Wow..  this seems like a really positive development.  Did the day of mourning actually push them to consider this, or were they considering it beforehand?"
tfc,37cvq1,warpus,8,Tue May 26 19:30:52 2015 UTC,"For those unaware of this solution, here is a link to an Argos blog discussing it, and here are some examples of it being used.  This method would see a hybrid grass pitch installed for next season, with protective tiles placed over the pitch and temporary artificial turf installed for CFL games."
tfc,37cvq1,PastPerfekt,8,Tue May 26 18:28:15 2015 UTC,MLSE could get some major feel good props from TFC and CMNT fans if they do this.
tfc,37cvq1,sfw84,7,Wed May 27 01:47:05 2015 UTC,"that is all i ever really wanted honestly.   well yeah, this is our house and get the fuck out. but we all knew it was going to happen. this is a happy medium in my eyes"
tfc,37cvq1,R00K416,5,Tue May 26 22:13:57 2015 UTC,It's a great solution.  Looks like Leiweke intends to keep his word.

tfc,37cvq1,boomcha,1 point,Tue May 26 18:26:39 2015 UTC,This has to be the best choice for both parties when they come. They don't screw up the real grass and no pointyball lines on the pitch. I actually saw this system (or similar) at Croke Park in Dublin for U2 concerts where they had the tiles on top of the nice grass. It was a bit slippery in the rain without the carpet on top but it worked.

tfc,37bxph,Northie113,2,Tue May 26 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"We could always just put out 2nd and third stringers. Bring in some TFC2 guys... As long as we don't waste OUR stars on the game, I don't have a problem with it."
tfc,37bxph,PrawnSolo,3,Tue May 26 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"I think we did that against Liverpool once and got in trouble for it (a fine?). I don't see why Man City's B-Team vs the TFC academy is an attractive or helpful game.   For the record, I have never been to one of these and won't go even if my favourite European team comes to play."
tfc,37bxph,Northie113,2,Tue May 26 16:14:49 2015 UTC,There is likely a clause as to the minimum amount of time your stars / percentage of 1st team have to play.
tfc,37bxph,PrawnSolo,4,Tue May 26 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"Do you not see that as part of the problem? You can be sure the TFC players and coaching staff have no interest in playing this game, and yet they are forced to not only participate, but they are forced to trot out Seba, Bradley, and other pieces of our first team.  As for City, they just played Sunday in England and play the Houston Dynamo the day after they play TFC.   I can almost swallow when these games happen in August, during the European pre-season. It kind of makes sense for City to want games at that point. But three days after their long regular season concludes? Fuck that. Pure money grab.  I wouldn't go if the tickets were free. I hope MLSE loses money on this. I know they can afford to lose money on one game, but they will definitely stop scheduling these if they keep losing money on them every year."
tfc,37bxph,Northie113,2,Tue May 26 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"Ya man, I don't disagree with you. I was never going. They could definitely find a better time to do it."
tfc,37bxph,PrawnSolo,2,Tue May 26 18:58:04 2015 UTC,Awesome News! My Seasons ticket for this game was 70 dollars or so and they gave me tickets worth 122!   To those who do not support the games being mid season I understand that. But people go their whole life and may never get to see the players they idolize. So I'm hoping to see the TFC reserves play but at the same time its going to be amazing to see the City players!
tfc,37bxph,Shlongus,3,Tue May 26 21:03:11 2015 UTC,Not supporting this money-grab.
tfc,37bxph,Soldado4lyf,7,Tue May 26 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"Alright then give me your tickets, id actually enjoy seeing people like david silva and aguero play even if it was a training session."

tfc,37bxou,CanadianGladiator,6,Tue May 26 14:28:35 2015 UTC,What the... I'm actually agreeing with Larson. It truly is a funny old game sometimes.
tfc,37bxou,section111,4,Tue May 26 14:38:18 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, we do have it good.  MLSE have been pumping a lot of money into the club, bringing big-name DPs here, upgrading the pitch, upgrading the facilities, upgrading the stadium, building a state of the art academy, making TFC2 happen, and so on..  and Leiweke has kept the focus on TFC during his stay here.  He deserves a lot of credit.  But that's not to say that criticism is not warranted...  It's not a ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"" kind of situation..  He's done some good.. He's done a lot of good.  That doesn't mean that the fans should keep quiet when they/we feel there is also an element of bad.  If the Argos work out at BMO field and we can never tell that they play there, when our boys in red step out onto the pitch..  then Leiweke will be remembered for all the good he's done.  But if it's a fuckup, he'll be only remembered for the bad.  And unfortunately I don't think we'll really know how this will end up until late into their first season here, which will be a while after he's already gone, I think.  With that in mind, I'm not surprised he's getting some flak now.  There will be no opportunity to do so once we really know what's what.  I think it's also worth mentioning that he probably had no power to keep the Argos out, even if he wanted to.   Money talks, after all..  So while I think it's fair to criticize him, we should also remember that it could have been a lot worse - and that I do really think he's been pushing for our interests as much as he could.  But yeah, like I said, if things go south and the atmosphere and/or footie game experience is affected..  he will be unfortunately only remembered for the bad."
tfc,37e088,Trolloc,5,Tue May 26 22:59:39 2015 UTC,Take the Go bus to union station. Then take the Lakeshore West Go train to Exhibition station. Bmo field is right there. Go is more expensive but it's more convenient and comfortable when you're outside the city.

tfc,377jgh,hurleyburleyundone,6,Mon May 25 16:50:29 2015 UTC,"Well, he's not hurt right now, and Caldwell is."
tfc,377jgh,fuzz_boy,2,Mon May 25 16:53:28 2015 UTC,Near sighted much?
tfc,377jgh,hurleyburleyundone,3,Mon May 25 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I am just talking about what's going on in this thread. I am aware there are other defenders, but that's another story, isn't it?"
tfc,377jgh,fuzz_boy,7,Mon May 25 17:11:21 2015 UTC,Please. I'd love to have O'Dea back.
tfc,377jgh,TorontoFC15,3,Mon May 25 15:53:15 2015 UTC,I'd definitely take him if he's around the 250-300k mark that Caldwell is around. Caldwell is simply finished. When he's on the field he's been solid but he's not on the field often and I don't expect him to be on the field often for the rest of the season. We're lucky his contract his up this season. Great guy though and good leader but just too old
tfc,377jgh,cctoronto,2,Mon May 25 17:13:51 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I got nothing but respect and love for Caldwell, but it's pretty obvious he's about done. Hope he stays on with the club in some capacity. O'Dea has never stopped bleeding Red and is more than welcome back."
tfc,3785c5,mafiazul,5,Mon May 25 17:41:34 2015 UTC,We're meant to play teams from the other conference at home every other year.  This clearly doesn't happen as we played Portland at home last year and then again this season.  But away to LA two years in a row.  No idea why.
tfc,3785c5,discostu81,2,Mon May 25 17:45:07 2015 UTC,I was looking at the calendar it seems to have no system.   i don't get why they can't do the face everyone twice type thing.
tfc,3785c5,FlyingCarsArePlanes,3,Mon May 25 17:50:32 2015 UTC,Because the U.S. and Canada are MASSIVE compared to any other country that does home and away round robin. Splitting the league into divisions is much more cost effective.
tfc,3785c5,FlyingCarsArePlanes,1 point,Mon May 25 18:38:34 2015 UTC,I was comparing it more to Brazil. Where its crazy hard to fly here and there. Still do face everyone twice
tfc,3785c5,Menessy27,3,Mon May 25 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"Brazil is the best comparison.  However, in Brazil, most of the population is near the Atlantic.  In North America, there are huge centers of population on both coasts, so Brazil isn't the best comparison.  The two-league system works for North American soccer, and I'm okay with it, especially now that the winners of both conferences get CCL berths."
tfc,3785c5,FlyingCarsArePlanes,2,Mon May 25 23:15:18 2015 UTC,"You'd think they would just do that but from quickly glancing over our schedule earlier this year I swear we have the majority of the same fixtures... last year I remember we played Portland at home, we went away to RSL early in the season, we started away vs Seattle, I remember we got destroyed by LA away, and we played Colorado and Dallas home as well. All those fixtures again this season.   And not to be some conspiracy theorist but it's pretty fucked how we get all the least winnable fixtures - LA away, Seattle away, Vancouver away, Dallas away, RSL away (altitude) and then get the worse teams at home in Colorado, Houston, Portland, San Jose, SKC (and Chivas last season) when these are the teams where you have a much bigger chance of drawing or winning when you're playing them away. In theory it's an even schedule for everyone but it's really not when we get the 5 toughest away games possible."
tfc,372f8r,TorontoFC15,6,Sun May 24 05:56:08 2015 UTC,"that Portland goalkeeper had a performance of his career. it would have been 3 or 4 goals there.    no highlights for Portland's chances, including great save by Konopka late on second half."

tfc,3714nn,Soldado4lyf,8,Sun May 24 00:30:19 2015 UTC,"Their explanation is that they only allow gfycats of ""Incredible Goals"" because they don't want content cluttering up the front page.

tfc,3714nn,PastPerfekt,2,Sat May 23 23:02:35 2015 UTC,lol Goalie was not prepared
tfc,371c04,DragonicKhaos,9,Sat May 23 23:07:05 2015 UTC,"Haven't heard anyone mention Benoît Cheyrou. He was man of the match for me. Controlled possession and found the break out pass on almost every occasion.   Morrow has improved a lot as well. Great to see them hold a clean sheet and should boost their confidence.   Can't say much more about Giovinco obviously the man is possessed. Class striker, lethal finish and had the defense in shambles every time the ball is on his toe. Osario robbed him of a sure 2nd along with Kwarasey making numerous saves..."
tfc,371c04,Acceptable_Casualty,3,Sun May 24 00:07:09 2015 UTC,"They need to do a better job of playing with/off Giovinco. The man is incredible, but I think he can be far more effective if other players start to provide outlets for him. Or at least make runs to draw defenders away from him."
tfc,371c04,mdps,2,Sun May 24 01:04:52 2015 UTC,"Other that the early slide tackle he missed to give Portland a good chance at the net, he was very good."
tfc,371c04,R00K416,6,Sun May 24 00:56:05 2015 UTC,I don't know what Osorio was thinking to run directly behind the goal keeper as Giovinco was about to shoot.  He just needed to stop moving.
tfc,371c04,R00K416,3,Sat May 23 23:10:23 2015 UTC,He's making a near post run in case Giovinco plays a ball in but instead Giovinco cut in and quickly shot. Unfortunate because that was a sure goal but hard to blame Osorio for that when it happened so quickly
tfc,371c04,Menessy27,2,Sun May 24 06:14:33 2015 UTC,He had a poor match today. I was really hoping to see him emerge playing around Bradley and Cheyrou.
tfc,371c04,mdps,1 point,Sun May 24 01:02:33 2015 UTC,"It was an unfortunate moment, but he played well. Led the team in passing percentage (as he always does)."
tfc,371c04,-notthesun-,1 point,Sun May 24 20:18:15 2015 UTC,"High pass completion percentage is nice, but I find that Osorio reverts to the safe pass instead of the penetrating pass. I don't recall seeing a lot of passes from him that threatened Portland's defence."
tfc,371c04,mdps,1 point,Mon May 25 18:20:45 2015 UTC,yea that was in otherwise and the missed penalty would've been irrelevant
tfc,371c04,Coramoor_,7,Sat May 23 23:17:00 2015 UTC,"We're too good offensively to bunker down starting at 45'.  Portland aren't a great team and we we ended up playing on our heels.    Konopka with another solid appearance.  I love having players who aren't afraid of having the ball at their feet and not just looking to pass it out as fast as possible.  Giovinco, Cheryou and to a lesser extent Bradley are all wonderful for this.  This is something we were missing last year, which is probably why we ended up doing a lot of kick and chase instead of proper building through the midfield."
tfc,371c04,LightsCameraRegret,10,Sun May 24 00:43:35 2015 UTC,I thought the protest from the supporters section was spot on. It felt eerie until they started singing again in the 23rd minute.

The Leafs have been a steaming pile of shit for the better part of ten years. I haven't budged; haven't taken my colours off for a second. Why? Because those were the colours I chose very early on in my childhood.  It's the same with TFC. I'm there for life for better or for worse. Besides, why would you only want to support a winning team anyway? How fucking empty is that? Nah. When they win it all - and they will eventually - there will be no glory for you because you didn't go through the shit that we all did in order to really savour the outcome. That just seems really sad to me."

I will bask in the glory of the Leafs if they ever win a cup, I've been through it all with that team and I've never wavered.  TFC has never given me a single reason to support them, I'd love to, but why would I emotionally invest in them? They need to earn my loyalty.  I appreciate your argument, but for me it doesn't apply for TFC."
tfc,36zrpo,onlynickleft,1 point,Mon May 25 21:32:22 2015 UTC,"Fair enough but I've always been a soccer fan so it was easy for me to take them on as my club even before they took to the field. In fact supporting this club feels so much more ""real"" to me (for lack of a better word) than supporting a club that exists 4000 mi away.   And I'll be honest with you; I don't even watch other leagues all that much anymore. MLS and TFC command almost all of my ""soccer time""."

Cuts through the deflections (lines on the pitch, logos) to the central issue: the playing surface. Acknowledges the fear that as soon as Leiweke leaves soccer will fade from MLSE's priority list."
tfc,36vww0,mdps,7,Fri May 22 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"Acknowledges the fear that as soon as Leiweke leaves soccer will fade from MLSE's priority list.   I think it's entirely reasonable to expect that. At the same time, I feel like I'm getting mixed signals.   MLSE has committed over $200+ million to TFC in the past 18 months. Between Bradley/Defoe/Gilberto/Jozy/Giovinco, and the $120 million in stadium renovations. That's more than 3x what they paid for the Argos. (I can't find the financial details for the Argo's sale but this article suggests Braley's asking price was $60 million a year ago.)  Removing everyone's TFC fan bias for a second, which franchise do you think has more room to grow on a local/global scale over the next 5/20/50 years? Which league do you think has more room to grow on national/global scale over the next 5/20/50 years?  We have 3 players on the roster who individually make more than the entire Argos payroll for a full season.  I can't say that MLSE will succeed in managing to preserve a pristine playing surface upon the Argos arrival, but I believe they truly think they can make it work. It's detrimental to TFC's success for it not to work. It just doesn't make financial sense for TFC to ever become second priority to the Argos. It doesn't follow MLSE's pattern of recent investments.  If there's one thing I have faith in MLSE, is their ability to spend money."

If you have a good section let him have the freedom to walk if he wants otherwise kids that age get kranky and complain. I often brought a little skills balls with us with my 3 year old (at the time) and we'd kick it back and forth by the food building when he got bored. Also buy him candy/popcorn etc as a reward for sitting and watching if he does get anxious and/or if he needs the incentive. 2 hours sitting is a long time for a 3 yr old so don't expect him to sit still the entire time.   That said, enjoy the game...I'll be there with my now 5yr old."

tfc,36ra15,cutchemist42,25,Thu May 21 14:22:01 2015 UTC,When Toronto started they were the only Canadian team in MLS and they basically wanted to present the team as Canada's team. The Toronto Raptors also drifted towards the red and white theme as well.
tfc,36ra15,rickyforr,14,Thu May 21 14:33:34 2015 UTC,"Although blue is an official Toronto colour, TFC (and BMO Field) went red because it is the national colour of Canada.   BMO Field was not just built for TFC. It is Canada's national soccer stadium. At the time they entered the league, TFC were also Canada's only professional soccer team (in MLS -- not going to argue whether the lower division versions of Whitecaps and Impact count as professional).   So in an attempt to match the (national) stadium and be marketable across the country, red was chosen."
tfc,36ra15,Northie113,6,Thu May 21 14:31:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other posters here.  At the time they chose colours, Toronto was the only Canadian team in MLS and there was no reason to believe that Montreal and Vancouver would be joining any time soon.  So red was chosen to represent Canada.  Toronto's off-field success paved the way for Montreal and Vancouver to join.  In some ways, this harkens back to an earlier tradition.  Upper Canada vs Lower Canada.  Redcoats vs the blue in the French military.  Ontario red flag vs Quebec's blue flag."

tfc,36ra15,Cannon49,9,Thu May 21 20:46:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe because Montreal was already blue, and while they weren't in MLS yet, fuck Montreal?   Red also makes for a rather good football colour, a lot of top teams use it.  I think the main reason might be that BMO is also Canada's national soccer stadium.  It's got to be red."

You're supporting an irrelevant clown franchise  They've given you 9 years mediocrity (if you can even call it that) they've taken you're support and fandom for granted and they haven't even bothered to field a respectable product. (they must be to busy counting your money/cleaning vomit off the bleachers)  TFC is a pathetic joke and massive failure. You've mistakenly given them blind loyalty and how have they rewarded you? They're the laughing stock of the MLS.  THE ARGOS ARE COMING!!! I PROMISE they're going to tear up your precious pitch, but I can assure you it'll be much more exciting to watch. Don't waste your breath defending this team and the field that they play on. They haven't earned it. Instead, come out and support the oldest professional grid iron football team in the world. A team with 132 years of history and 16 Grey Cups a team thats deserving of your support, fandom and hard earned dollars. The Argo's are doing you a favour, you can now use your shitty torn up field as an excuse for why your so terrible.  (mic drop)"

tfc,36q236,drretro,3,Thu May 21 16:30:14 2015 UTC,I like how the age of the team somehow makes them more important than every other sports franchise in the city. It's great and all that their fans are passionate and I'm fine with that but the logic from some of them is utterly ridiculous
tfc,36q236,Kim_Jong_Unchained,3,Thu May 21 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean good for them, really. By Toronto standards, that is honestly pretty good. But apparently it's not been good enough to have earned them their own stadium by now, 132 years later. So how much is that great and storied history worth? And to be fair, I think that's a question their fans need to be asking of their owners - past and present."
tfc,36q236,drretro,2,Fri May 22 00:54:51 2015 UTC,"In eastern europe teams (and their ultra) that do not have a home arena dedicated primarily to their team and their sport are referred to as 'bums'(бомжи). Among popular teams, FC Zenit in RPL is referred to as bums because their home the Kirov Stadium was demolished, and they are playing in an interim stadium while their new arena is being built. Other known 'bum' is FC Metalurh Zaporizhya in Ukrainian PL. While they do have a pretty decent and euro-certified arena now, a prolong absence of one in the past has earned them this unfortunate title."

But hey, you're well aware of that and the other reason the argos were bought, right? (which no one seems to speak of) But I'm sure you're plenty excited to watch the welcoming of the inevitable NFL team too. Hey at least then we'll have a professional ""football"" team in Toronto, one that just doesn't claim to be storied, but one that plays in a league that has been relevant in the last few decades and actually plays players of quality. But hey history and 16 grey cups and stuff, right?"
tfc,36q236,triskelions,4,Thu May 21 14:08:01 2015 UTC,"It's harder to miss the playoffs than it is to make it in the CFL.

Well for starters bringing over Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore along with Giovinco who are all big names especially for the MLS. Yes, TFC was a tad dysfunctical (lol a lot) for like 6 years but tbf we've been trying to pull our act together.   Doing us a favour?

I care about it for me as a fan and for the players. If it looks like grass (like Leiweke says it will) and the players (not Tim Leiweke) say the pitch is as good as natural grass, I'm sold.

tfc,36ng2j,R00K416,3,Thu May 21 13:16:27 2015 UTC,"I don't particularly care for the CFL as a whole, but assuming MLSE stays true to Leiweke's word about TFC being the first, second, and third priority at BMO, why is this such a big deal?  Let's recap the issues hosting a CFL game presents for us:   The playing surface will be compromised, as football games tend to damage the terrain from all the physical contact. The painted lines and logos on the field are an eyesore.   Feel free to correct me, but aren't those the only two issues? Has MLSE not promised that they have solutions for them?  Here's why I don't care if the Argos play at BMO Field or not, assuming Leiweke stays true to his word:  The more money MLSE makes, the more they will put into TFC. I don't know how you can argue against this being a good thing in the long run for our club. We just gave Babcock $50 million to come coach the Leafs.  We field the most expensive roster in MLS. (In fact, I think in MLS history, no?) MLSE has proven over the last two years that they are dedicated into making us an MLS powerhouse. No team has ever acquired a player like Giovinco. The second a 4th DP spot opens up, MLSE will go out and spend the money. We were just given an 8,500 seat addition. Now the roofs are coming.  There's a special irony in watching half of you continue to complain about the Argos whilst you wear your Giovinco jersey, sitting the shade of the renovated East Grandstand next season. None of you complaining about the pitch will ever step foot on it either."
tfc,36ng2j,mdps,2,Wed May 20 22:45:11 2015 UTC,"I think ""...assuming MLSE stays true to Leiweke's word..."" is a massive assumption. Whoever comes after Leiweke - and he or she is coming soon - will almost certainly not be as committed to soccer as Leiweke. And MLSE will forget about Leiweke's promises as fast as it forgets about its fans when money is waved in their faces. If a clever executive does the math differently, all those expensive DPs can depart as quickly as they arrived"
tfc,36ng2j,notdarren,2,Fri May 22 02:50:00 2015 UTC,"So what does this mean for our field?    I keep hearing that they play on turf, and that's why the sky dome needs them gone so they can get real grass.     Does this mean we'll change from grass back to turf just for this?"

There has been a lot of mud slinging back and forth but there is no reason this can't work successfully for both teams!  Cheers fellas!
tfc,36ng2j,Richard_Swinger_Esq,8,Wed May 20 18:08:17 2015 UTC,Your tactic of belittling TFC as piddly in order to bolster the Argos entitlement was ultimately successful. Kudos. Please don't ruin our stadium.  Edit: headed over to r/cfl to have a look at this olive branch. More classless nonsense. Off to make a Scumbag Steve meme.
tfc,36ng2j,Stach37,-5,Wed May 20 21:48:12 2015 UTC,Really? Because all I saw was TFC fans infiltrating our sub today talking trash to us (many who ultimately deleted their comments) and our league players sticking up for Toronto fans. I don't see where you get this TFC belittlement from.
tfc,36ng2j,Coramoor_,3,Wed May 20 23:40:52 2015 UTC,"well it's Canadian football, very different game. Much less likely to ruin the field than American football"
tfc,36ng2j,Stach37,2,Thu May 21 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"Going out of your way (not you specifically, I'm speaking in terms of how I've seen TFC fans speak on the Argos all across the internet) to belittle a franchise that has such a deep historical connection to Canada and the city of Toronto makes many TFC fans come off as incredibly petty, especially in a stadium built by tax payers with football in mind. BMO was never suppose to be soccer specific. It just so happened to play out that way until the Argos got their ownership situation taken care of.  Look at it from this perspective. The Rogers Centre WAS built for the Argos. It was an Argos first stadium. And slowly but surely the Argos we're booted from a home that was built for them by a company that has some vendetta against our league.   At the end of the day we're roommates now. For better or for worse. I see nothing wrong with TFC and the Argos sharing a stadium and co-existing and I honestly feel it might bring legitimacy to both teams if the leagues fans co-operated, got along, and generally wished for the well being of each others franchises. At the end of the day both teams represent the same city in their respective sport, and that's really the only thing that matters; bringing professional sport and championships to the city of Toronto."

I swear most people that bring up how important the Argos are and everything don't live in this city because aside from TSN, you don't hear about them anywhere else here. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if 2/3 of the Argo's TV ratings are from people in Manitoba or Saskatchewan that have nothing better to do than watch random CFL games no one here cares about."
tfc,36ng2j,drretro,2,Thu May 21 00:48:48 2015 UTC,Seconded. I live two hours from Toronto and I see more evidence of the Argo's existence here then any time I visit TO.

Almost all games get 8-9 hundred thousand so it has nothing to do with the Argos.  Although I am from Manitoba and don't watch because if boredom, I care despite Torontos bad atmosphere."

tfc,36ng2j,mdps,1 point,Wed May 20 19:41:40 2015 UTC,Would it be possible to roll out a fake turf field with gridiron lines over the grass just for the Argos games and leave it as a grass soccer pitch at all other times?
tfc,36ng2j,Coramoor_,1 point,Wed May 20 20:08:01 2015 UTC,Usually I wait until after the season to decide whether or not to renew my season seats. Now I'm thinking about it in May.

tfc,36jszy,northdancer,5,Wed May 20 00:27:57 2015 UTC,you do know that their season high for attendance last year barely peaked over 19k right?
tfc,36jszy,mdps,3,Wed May 20 02:43:52 2015 UTC,They should be playing at Varsity Stadium.
tfc,36jggn,BanksKnowsBest,10,Tue May 19 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"The solutions is a very simple one. TFC plays on their Hybrid natural turf, while The Argonauts play on a Synthetic turf. TFC won’t have to deal with the extra paint polluting the pristine natural pitch they’ve become accustomed to or the wear and tear of 9 football games. The Argonauts won’t have to worry about the ad placement or stripping the colour from their logos and get one surface.   TL;DR - Argos should play on a removable surface that is installed on-top of the natural turf.  How realistic is this?"
tfc,36jggn,R00K416,9,Tue May 19 21:38:42 2015 UTC,Never heard of this option but if it's possible then it would certainly mitigate some of the damage.
tfc,36jggn,quelar,4,Tue May 19 22:07:22 2015 UTC,It would be more realistic and easier to just superimpose the advertising on the CFL field like other sports use.
tfc,36jggn,ticky13,4,Tue May 19 23:10:35 2015 UTC,"but you cannot add the field lines with CGI, the players and refs need to see them as well..."
tfc,36jggn,R00K416,3,Tue May 19 23:14:20 2015 UTC,It's a lot easier to paint over some white lines than huge chunks of multicoloured advertising.
tfc,36jggn,ticky13,2,Tue May 19 23:29:34 2015 UTC,Why can't they install hybrid grass at BMO?  They almost certainly will and some of the best club in the world play on it.
tfc,36jggn,marcman84,4,Wed May 20 02:08:47 2015 UTC,"if you bothered to read the article at all, they are. and there's still issues. like exampled in the article, wembley last year looked like utter and complete shit between the national team playing there between nfl games. you could clearly see where the lines were and how much the center of the field was wrecked from cleats.  teams like milan and inter play on it yes, because they don't have any other choice. they screwed up the stadium adding the third tier and sun couldn't get to the grass. they were replacing grass almost every month. that ain't cheap"
tfc,36jggn,sfw84,5,Wed May 20 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"""Many fans claimed"" the turf looked bad, followed by low quality screenshots.

I just don't get why some TFC fans have such an issue with this, other than ""this is our stadium and I dont wanna share."""
tfc,36jggn,marcman84,2,Wed May 20 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure what your point is about the hybrid grass. There's no opposition to it. It's the fact that it will be ripped up regardless of what kind of field they use besides field turf, which is a nonstarter."

tfc,36jaus,Richard_Swinger_Esq,2,Wed May 20 03:58:07 2015 UTC,Or it could unravel the ownership of MLSE.  Rogers was opposed to MLSE buying the Argos because TSN has a long-term contract with the CFL.  (TSN is owned by Bell. SportsNet by Rogers.) Now 2 of the 3 MLSE owners bought the Argos. This partnership arrangement between competitors has always been weird.
tfc,36jaus,quelar,1 point,Tue May 19 22:45:11 2015 UTC,It was odd the day it was announced. I never understood how two media competitors were allowed to buy their biggest market sports creator but here we are and we will see his this effects them.

tfc,36hzdm,LightsCameraRegret,8,Tue May 19 15:06:48 2015 UTC,I would rather see Dike or Hamilton up there instead of Moore..  but that seems unlikely..
tfc,36hzdm,warpus,3,Tue May 19 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's brutal. Luke Moore really brings nothing to the table. I said the same last year. He's just... mediocre.  Hamilton and Giovinco could work. May not be optimal, but if we play the 4-1-3-2 then we still have the strong 4 in the midfield we played with on the weekend, and Giovinco can still create up front. Losing Altidore is rough, but we can adjust. Hamilton might get a look, which would be great.  I'm not hopeless. It's a blow, but its not as bad as it would be if we were playing with a lone striker."
tfc,36hzdm,EasterlyFan,3,Tue May 19 16:25:10 2015 UTC,Guess I won't be able to watch him this Saturday. :( Tough loss for TFC...
tfc,36hzdm,errboi,3,Tue May 19 15:19:56 2015 UTC,I just read that we can't call Dike back up until July 15th
tfc,36hzdm,TastyTacoTonight,1 point,Tue May 19 16:43:02 2015 UTC,Yup. Gotta wait for the transfer window since there's a border involved.
tfc,36hzdm,TastyTacoTonight,3,Tue May 19 22:05:05 2015 UTC,"Aw man that's rough. Altidore was doing so well for us this season. Luke Moore is so mediocre it's unbelievable. That run against New England I think when Giovinco was through was brutal. I'd honestly rather giving Hamilton a run out or maybe even adjusting our formation to play with a lone striker as Giovinco. He does great in creating chances too but we've got to adapt and he also is naturally a Centre forward. I'm thinking 4-2-3-1 with our back 4, Warner & Cheyrou as defensive midfielders, Osorio as Left Mid, Bradley as Centre attacking mid, Findley or Jackson as right mid and Giovinco up top. It could work, Bradley looked a lot better vs new england when he was roaming forward."
tfc,36hzdm,deluga,3,Tue May 19 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"Only issue is that Giovinco will never win a long ball in his life and as the home team vs Portland, we will probably have more possession & take the game to Portland which probably will result in more long balls and crosses. In an away game it might be a better strategy while playing the counter attack with Giovinco's pace."
tfc,36hzdm,quelar,3,Tue May 19 17:24:26 2015 UTC,"so wait, does that mean we won't have him until the Gold Cup is done? So for like 2 months?"
tfc,36hzdm,TorontoFC15,2,Tue May 19 17:28:39 2015 UTC,Pretty much. I can't see him not getting called up.
tfc,36hzdm,Shlongus,2,Tue May 19 17:32:14 2015 UTC,Fuck.
tfc,36hzdm,TFCAguia,2,Tue May 19 16:47:55 2015 UTC,I guess it's just Moore of the same for now.

These friendlies are meant to draw out the soccer fans in Toronto who are ambivalent to TFC and want to see big name stars. They're hoping that by getting these fans through they door they might come watch TFC more often. I've been a season ticket holder since the beginning and I can tell you the supporter's section looks drastically different from the regular season crowd at these friendlies."

tfc,36dl1j,arsenefinger,4,Tue May 19 17:57:47 2015 UTC,Typically with these friendlies there is a clause in the contract that they must play some of their starting 11. Not sure who though.
tfc,36dl1j,kodiaktfc,2,Mon May 18 15:27:16 2015 UTC,"Alright, so they will probably leave Aguero and Toure at home."

tfc,36dl1j,quelar,1 point,Tue May 19 00:23:41 2015 UTC,The contract states they must play their healthy starters for 30 minutes. Then you will see their c or d string team out there.

tfc,3680vd,DragonicKhaos,14,Sun May 17 01:39:27 2015 UTC,"Holy mother of balls is our backline weak against crosses, it's heart-attack inducing. Fagundez probably should have scored at the death on that header. It was almost a carbon copy of the late goal vs. RSL.  We look really good going forward. Warner and Osorio are a breath of fresh air in midfield. So much better than the possession black holes of Findley and Jackson, and it leads to better build up and chances for us.  Konopka was huge, good bounce back game for Cheyrou, and Bradley's goal was incredible.  Really sucks about Altidore though... considering how anonymous Moore was and has been so far this season I would love to see Hamilton get a chance (with Dike on loan and all)."

tfc,3680vd,mdps,8,Sun May 17 14:08:39 2015 UTC,"Konopka was a difference maker today. Not bad for a career back-up.  Bradley is finally played in his proper position, and he excels. Go figure."

Bradley looked great, figures once you throw him where he is supposed to play. Altidore coming off early is not a good sign, hopefully it's not too bad."
tfc,3680vd,TorontoFC15,5,Sun May 17 03:19:55 2015 UTC,I'll take it.  On the road against a good team with injuries.
tfc,3680vd,quelar,4,Sun May 17 01:49:33 2015 UTC,"Man we need to cut out the headed goals... it's not even like it's one guy consistently doing it either but guys just randomly switch off. This is the style we should be playing without a doubt though. Not a fan of 442 bus parking and Bradley has looked better in that position as well. We resorted to that 442 style at the end and almost paid but at the same time it's hard to fault a team who played 3 games in 7 days for being tired at the end...  The Altidore thing is a real shame. By the time he's ready to come back it'll probably be the Gold Cup, so there's a good chance we've just lost Altidore for 2 months. I wonder if Bez will be more inclined to make a summer move now... remember we were linked with quite a few strikers in Italy. I wonder if Bez was considering a move to replace Jozy during the GC in the first place"

New England is very good this year, 18 points in 10 games which is good for second in the east and fourth overall so this will be very tough.

tfc,362uhc,now_we_here,5,Fri May 15 17:04:26 2015 UTC,"Park just south of Lamport Stadium. It's like $5, then just take the tunnel at exhibition station to go under the train tracks and you're there. You'll miss the majority of the traffic being on the other side of the tracks and it's cheap."
tfc,362uhc,DukesOfHazard,3,Fri May 15 18:44:47 2015 UTC,25 bucks for decent parking during the week. 20 on weekends. or park outside the city for free and take the Go Train. from Michigan I would say Oakville Go station or Mississauga. Take that to Exhibition.
tfc,362uhc,ExProxy,2,Fri May 15 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"Taking a Go Train in will cost me a little less than double what parking will, if it's $20.  Will parking be readily available near BMO for games?"
tfc,362uhc,ExProxy,2,Fri May 15 18:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. there are a ton of lots surrounding BMO. I personally park at Medieval Times, there is another lot just down the street there and then there is parking at BMO. All 25/20"
tfc,362uhc,mdps,3,Fri May 15 18:03:21 2015 UTC,"There is parking available at the rates you see quoted here. Just expect hellish traffic, especially after the game. The only really convenient way in to BMO Field is on foot or bicycle."
tfc,362uhc,mattgrande,2,Fri May 15 18:09:46 2015 UTC,Bigger question: How many of these parking places will accept USD?
tfc,362uhc,DisembodiedHand,3,Fri May 15 18:29:02 2015 UTC,Probably not many. Your bank will be able to get your Canadian cash.
tfc,362uhc,onlynickleft,3,Fri May 15 19:24:24 2015 UTC,If they are manned lots they'll happily accept USD. If it's a green P lot then it will accept visa/MC.

tfc,362y49,Holdmylife,0,Fri May 15 23:32:42 2015 UTC,At most sporting events the wheelchair seats are mid range. Because they're close at BMO Field you're looking at paying insane money to go to a game. My friend uses a wheel chair and he still hasn't attended because he's not willing to pay those prices when everyone else can choose to pay $30-$50.
tfc,360n6l,R00K416,7,Fri May 15 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"I'm still erect from Giovinco's chip vs Dallas lol Perquis.  Has made tons of costly mistakes and he is constantly being caught when he presses up. Morgan.  Who even thought he would have seen any playing time?  Still can be a bit shaky defensively, but he's been good going forward.  Not if we keep playing the way we're playing.  I'd like to think we're gonna click soon, but nothing really surprises me about this team anymore. No...at least not now.  He's not a great coach, but he's at least adequate.  The last thing we need is another mid-season shake up.  He hasn't really done enough yet to justify bringing him back after this season, but hasn't been poor enough to fire.  We'll see how it plays out over the rest of the season."
tfc,360n6l,jztrumpeter,2,Fri May 15 03:18:22 2015 UTC,Agreed 100% on Vanney
tfc,360n6l,Soldado4lyf,1 point,Fri May 15 03:47:29 2015 UTC,Here's the thing about the playoff race in the east so far: All the teams behind us have looked even more shit than we have. We're really not going to need to be in great form to make it to playoffs if things continue the way they are going so far.
tfc,360n6l,errboi,3,Fri May 15 04:40:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a sucker for freekicks so Gio's against Dallas Giovinco I guess, sure saved us a lot. I don't even know at this point. Guess I have to go with Perquis Morgan. I don't know what Vanney did to him but he's playing a lot better than what he used to play like.  We'll scrap by unless we pick up our play.  No, fuck that revolving door. No more mid season shake ups, it ruins us. Wait to the end of the season and go from there."
tfc,360n6l,TorontoFC15,2,Fri May 15 09:54:43 2015 UTC,"Jozy vs orlando. Perfect pass, perfect touch. Giovinco Perquis (seems cruel to say Caldwell for getting hurt so early) Morgan Yes; but we'll crash out in the away leg for the first round, rendering tickets for the home leg worthless. Defer to jztrumpter. Vanney is perfect for MLSE: Not good enough to bring back; Not bad enough to fire."
tfc,360n6l,mdps,2,Fri May 15 03:54:43 2015 UTC,"Cheyrou v Columbus I think? The one where Gio cut it back and he just placed it on the half volley. Seba or Jozy, with consolation to Morrow who's been good considering he's played all along the back. Perquis  Jackson, usually think he's atrocious but he's not been game endingly bad yet. By the skin of our teeth. Probably."

tfc,360n6l,kierdoyle,2,Fri May 15 15:23:11 2015 UTC,"Gio chip goal against Dallas. Just made it look so easy. Giovinco without a doubt Lots of guys but Findley I'd say is the most underwhelming one who's seen a lot of minutes. Hasn't been much of a difference maker.  Morgan, who has come back from the dead...if only he was a right back so Morrow could go back to the left. Also Altidore. A lot of people thought he'd have a slow start but he has been pretty effective most games so far. Yes Not yet. Still would like to see if this team can come together. We might need to make some moves in the summer transfer window."
tfc,360n6l,rickyforr,1 point,Fri May 15 15:14:58 2015 UTC,Altidore has been amazing in the games he's shown up for. But he was AWOL in a couple of games as well.
tfc,360n6l,mdps,1 point,Fri May 15 18:12:03 2015 UTC,"I think Jozy is a striker that is reliant upon good service to be effective. It's why he did shit all at Sunderland. He's not the focus of our attack, but he's been pretty damn dynamic when him and Giovinco are playing off each other."
tfc,360n6l,Menessy27,1 point,Sat May 16 01:50:06 2015 UTC,Hard to argue against Giovinco vs Philadelphia. A free kick like that in MLS is a rarity Giovinco by a mile I expected Hagglund to be a lot more solid than he has been. Osorio has also been pretty invisible Morgan especially on a struggling and injured backline. Konopka has also exceeded expectations Absolutely. Even playing 8/9 on the road and having played less games than most teams we're still in a playoff spot. There are really only 4 good teams in the East (not considering us) Definitely not. The home game was disappointing but other than that we're getting a solid PPG on the road despite injuries/absences/bad refereeing. And even if the results werent decent its still a stupid idea to fire the coach at this stage
tfc,35yw5r,mdps,0,Thu May 14 17:49:39 2015 UTC,Are both Roberts and Bono any worse than Konopka?
tfc,35yw5r,rocky_iwata,5,Thu May 14 21:31:26 2015 UTC,I haven't found Konopka to be bad at all in the last few games.

tfc,35wh6i,warpus,11,Thu May 14 02:23:38 2015 UTC,Second half was the most entertaining football I've seen at BMO in quite some time.
tfc,35wh6i,discostu81,10,Thu May 14 02:35:49 2015 UTC,I know it shouldn't have made a difference but the obvious sending off of Bernier I thought would have changed things. Ref definitely chickened out.   Perquis was extremely poor today...   ODOURO Seriously???   Giovinco played well with Altidore however I was a bit disappointed with Bradley today.
tfc,35wh6i,Acceptable_Casualty,2,Thu May 14 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"Ya I can't overlook that especially with how often we're on the wrong end of calls. IMO he should have seen a straight red for stepping on Altidore's leg well after the ball was gone, then the foul on Giovinco was a textbook yellow considering he a) made absolutely no attempt to get the ball and b) fouled him to break up an opportunity on the break. 11 v 10 at home we could have easily just held the ball and killed the game off but instead Montreal could continue to go forward and got the goal. Once the referee fucked that up it was so obvious they were going to end up scoring late on."
tfc,35wh6i,Menessy27,3,Thu May 14 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Giovinco being taken down in the box, no call."
tfc,35wh6i,R00K416,1 point,Thu May 14 02:31:51 2015 UTC,"When a referee gives cautions for simple fouls and ignores bookable (even dismissible) offences on both sides of the ball, then he's only making a show of protecting the players."
tfc,35wh6i,mdps,1 point,Thu May 14 17:31:56 2015 UTC,Can't tell if your trying to defend the referee... If he booked the players initially to try and stem the flow of future fouls he didn't succeed.   Once you have booked the first player a standard has been set which should be followed throughout the rest of the game. It's up to the players to adjust to the ref not the other way around.
tfc,35wh6i,Acceptable_Casualty,2,Thu May 14 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I wasn't clear. I am not at all trying to defend the official. You're right about the first booking setting a standard. The trouble with this official in my opinion is that his first booking was for a foul that was not worthy of a booking. Thereafter he was inconsistent so they players don't know what the standard is. For example, he called Giovinco for simulation in the box without booking him. That's incongruous. Twice he had long chats regarding serious fouls yet didn't show a card either time. He shouldn't be wasting the time if he's not ready to make a decision."
tfc,35wh6i,mdps,8,Fri May 15 03:42:17 2015 UTC,"My first ever game and probably last, because I live elsewhere far away. I was really impressed and jealous of the BMO vibe, having seen a variety of games in NA. I was blown away with Giovinco's speed and Bradley's vision. I was not proven wrong with my expectations of Altidore, and he seemed good but nothing remarkable other than a Big strong striker. I really loved the feel of the stadium and the corner with the intense fans. 9/10 would watch again."
tfc,35wh6i,aronedu,-2,Thu May 14 04:12:29 2015 UTC,Altidore had a goal and two assists. You are a moron. His hold up play allowed the attack to function properly.
tfc,35wh6i,Trollsauce27,8,Thu May 14 06:17:32 2015 UTC,"I swear if I'm at a match and Vanney subs out our attackers as soon as we're up a goal in throwing something at him. Every time we try to park the bus when we have a one goal lead we fucking concede. TFC need the cushion goal, we're not a late game defence team.  Also, when do we get to waive Luke Moore already?"
tfc,35wh6i,FinestStateMachine,4,Thu May 14 02:31:17 2015 UTC,I would like to subscribe to your newsletter!
tfc,35wh6i,boomcha,2,Thu May 14 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"I was hoping someone would say this, I agree fully.    Well maybe not the throwing stuff, but I know you're being figurative."
tfc,35wh6i,fuzz_boy,2,Thu May 14 12:45:15 2015 UTC,Can't agree with you on Moore. He's suitable as a backup striker. Not sure Hamilton or Findley would have offered anything more.
tfc,35wh6i,mdps,0,Thu May 14 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"Moore is slow, can't control the ball, and is rarely if ever in a good position to take a pass. He also shows literally no fight or desire to be out there. I'd rather play Bitchy."
tfc,35wh6i,FinestStateMachine,0,Thu May 14 17:37:52 2015 UTC,And yet he scored 6 goals last year.
tfc,35wh6i,mdps,0,Thu May 14 17:56:51 2015 UTC,He looked like he wanted to be here last year.
tfc,35wh6i,FinestStateMachine,1 point,Thu May 14 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"Well, he did go from being a frequent starter to an occasional sub. Perhaps he hasn't had the opportunity yet this year."
tfc,35wh6i,mdps,1 point,Fri May 15 03:43:35 2015 UTC,I think he got an offseason offer from Birmingham that was turned down. He was also definitively a Nelsen guy.
tfc,35wh6i,FinestStateMachine,8,Fri May 15 04:18:47 2015 UTC,"Went to the game, atmosphere was much better in the second half and the performance was much better too.  Shame they couldn't do more with all the chances...probably 3-4 decent opportunities that should have hit the back of the net.  Great game overall!"
tfc,35wh6i,StudentofOz,5,Thu May 14 02:41:46 2015 UTC,"So, it was clear we were going out of the cup the second Jozy was subbed off right? We can't defend. Did we learn nothing on Sunday? I mean, really it was 3 days ago. That didn't work for us then, why would it work now?  The atmosphere was dead until the second half, but it got decent when we put those two quick goals in.   Really disappointed though."
tfc,35wh6i,lucastimmons,2,Thu May 14 03:09:03 2015 UTC,"Well, we were leading when he was subbed off. Wasn't he replaced by another forward (Moore)? The interesting one was when Hagglund came in and play forward."
tfc,35wh6i,feb914,3,Thu May 14 03:12:22 2015 UTC,"It was more just the feeling of the squad if that makes sense. It feels like we can win when he's on the pitch. It feels like we can score when he's on the pitch. He has that x factor.   It immediately stopped feeling like that when he came off. Like we felt we had it wrapped up and wouldn't need him anymore and could just wait it out.   I can't quantify it, that's just how it felt."
tfc,35wh6i,lucastimmons,5,Thu May 14 03:17:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you're saying, but what excuse do we have for letting in a goal with 10 minutes left?  We don't deserve to move forward."
tfc,35wh6i,R00K416,5,Thu May 14 03:21:15 2015 UTC,"i get where you are coming from. i do feel that switching him out was an indication that they gave up scoring another goal. i suspect his slight injury few minutes earlier may be the factor of the sub though. if that is the case, i understand why Vanney doesn't want to risk injury"
tfc,35wh6i,feb914,3,Thu May 14 03:26:27 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. I think that Vanney wanted to give Jozy a rest, he had made a very solid contribution, and really, our defence should have been able to hold it together.   Vanney wants Jozy / Gio / Bradley for the weekend. Jozy was already battered.   I understand the sub. Its a shame it happened because we could have used Jozy."
tfc,35wh6i,EasterlyFan,3,Thu May 14 11:19:16 2015 UTC,I don't know what to say :/ We just had to concede late
tfc,35wh6i,Tin_Tin_,5,Thu May 14 02:17:28 2015 UTC,Not even surprised. Doesn't even hurt any more.
tfc,35wh6i,FormerSlacker,4,Thu May 14 02:22:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely inexcusable.  Now, we won't be eligible to play in North America until 2017."
tfc,35wh6i,now_we_here,4,Thu May 14 02:30:54 2015 UTC,"Glad I went to the game and got to see the back to back goals quite closely.    Man, Giovinco doesn't disappoint but he needed support so his effort doesn't get wasted for nothing.    Better link up play than last Sunday, definitely better play overall. Bradley connects his passes well.   Coleen Warner is very good as a winger, he provides option on right wing and manage to make that side threatening. Morrow's overlap also has similar impact.    The other defender that is not Perquis (Zavaleta?) is not bad either.    EDIT: i sat next to a French person who's big fan of Cheyrou. He's very happy when he scored."

This was probably the best TFC game I've watched since the Vancouver match to start the season. Our attack was threatening. Defence is once again the weak link, and the part of the field that prevents us from advancing.   I wonder if Perquis was just tired today. He didn't have a good game. I also don't know why Vanney subbed Hagglund for Morrow? Morrow was fine out there, Perquis was the one who was struggling.  Anyway, as I said, I'm really upset we are missing CCL. I feel we should have put this same squad on the field last week and we would have been there. We need to aim to be a team that wins continental tournaments. Baby steps I guess, though, MLS Cup contenders two years in a row is the new prize?"
tfc,35wh6i,EasterlyFan,1 point,Thu May 14 11:24:54 2015 UTC,Ya Perquis wasn't good but it's hard to fault the guy when he's the only reason the backline hasn't been a massive disaster so far this season. And Vanney subbed on Hagglund to play up front because he's a threat in the air
tfc,35wh6i,Menessy27,5,Thu May 14 18:54:54 2015 UTC,Giovinco is worth every penny.  He's just amazing on and off the ball.
tfc,35wh6i,LightsCameraRegret,3,Thu May 14 03:09:08 2015 UTC,"I was at the game and I could not believe how many times we got caught with only one defender back (usually Zavaleta). Everytime the ball went to the fullbacks there was absolutely no movement or runs, especially to the outside, when I could see 20 foot holes they could have ran through. I thought we dominated the game though. Giovinco played well, Altidore was fantastic, Warrener and Morgan played well and Bradley, Cheyrou and Perquis were pretty poor. Oh and what the fuck was that for an attempt by Hagglund at the end? I saw a good team out there that looked like they didn't know what they were supposed to do. I hope we look for a new coach next season, it was inexcusable to take Altidore off, he played fantastic and we should've pushed for a 4th goal. Also it was a very poory refed games (as usual...)."

tfc,35wh6i,TastyTacoTonight,2,Thu May 14 03:22:00 2015 UTC,I like Cheyrou a lot. He's been one of our best players this season but today I just felt there was something missing. Just felt like he didn't take as many risks as he usually does. He didn't play bad but compared to his other performances he was below average. Also great username lol

For me Vanney has to go and very soon, we shouldnt be wasting a whole season while we can still get a playoff spot. we might sneek in just with the players we have but we need an experienced manager if we want any chance of winning the cup. Vanney will not get the job done. the european season is nearly over we should be searching the market for someone over there"
tfc,35wh6i,ryulaaa,1 point,Thu May 14 04:07:14 2015 UTC,"Perquis should not get beat on a header defending against Odouro, who is nothing special in the air. Not sure who missed his mark on the first goal, but it was probably a midfielder given the location of the shot."
tfc,35wh6i,mdps,1 point,Thu May 14 17:44:32 2015 UTC,Yeah he didn't even really challenge the header. He didn't jump at all but maybe he got caught flat-footed. But he still had a pretty poor game. His passing was off as well. And the first goal Perquis tried getting over to him and the guy tipped it in front should have been covered by Zavaleta who lost track of him and just kind of stood there.

tfc,35wh6i,R00K416,1 point,Thu May 14 02:22:53 2015 UTC,I would say that was the first game where I thought all 3 dps played well. There was good link up play between them and the passes on the goals were pretty sweet.
tfc,35wh6i,apaq11,0,Thu May 14 13:59:39 2015 UTC,Sunday we lost 2-0 to the worst team in the Western Conference at home. Last night we let the worst team in MLS score two goals against us at home and advance in the Cup. So much for the much anticipated return to BMO Field.

Will probably be buying seasons tickets next year, but we'll need to sort out with our group how many seats to get.    Personally, I grew up in a hockey family but then moved to Europe, and watched some matches but never really caught the fever. When I met my girlfriend though, she was very subtle and offered to bring me to some TFC matches if I wanted. I went, found it fun, and am still learning all about the players and the rules. I like the atmosphere at BMO fields as well (*recent news idiots not included)."

tfc,35qzvq,LightsCameraRegret,4,Tue May 12 20:46:45 2015 UTC,Serious question: does this guy have any grounds to fight his employer for any form of wrongful termination? I mean he wasn't the one who said FHRITP and he wasn't disgracing the company by acknowledging he worked for Hydro One when he laughed and spoke with the reporter.
tfc,35qzvq,ACM1899,7,Wed May 13 03:08:58 2015 UTC,Hydro One don't really mess around when it comes to that kind of thing. People in that company have been fired for less.
tfc,35qzvq,Jaysenka,3,Wed May 13 08:11:49 2015 UTC,"Someone on the Red Patch boys forum posted this:  ""Actually AM 640 had an employment lawyer on tonight who also happens to have a show on AM 640 on the weekends. In his practice he helps people get severance and helps people who've been wrongfully dismissed etc. He actually said that the hydro one employee can't be fired for saying what he said but also said that he would have done the same thing. The guy is basically just owed severance even in a wrongful dismissal or something to that effect."""
tfc,35qzvq,stevielarson,3,Wed May 13 12:13:05 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to what language is written in their contracts. If it states conduct detrimental to the image of the company is grounds for dismissal, it may not be an issue"

Then came the Internet vigilantism and now a guy is out of a job because a bunch of people got offended by honestly, a somewhat harmless Internet joke that should always be expected following a soccer match full of drunk people. Seriously, is it THAT offensive? It's aimed at no one in particular and by no means malicious, offensive yes but like, track down the guys identity and get him fired offensive? Definitely not.  Edit: okay maybe I got some facts wrong. Not everyone is as morally upstanding as the anonymous reddit user, but this site can be ridiculous. Not a month and a half ago a FHRITP post made the top of /r/leafs and everyone called the guy a legend, now that someone loses their job and gets called out, everyone finally acts like it's as offensive as it has always been. I just feel for the guy and am tired of the Internet constantly witch hunting people who make a mistake in the media. God damn. Yes I still do think the guy is an asshole and wouldn't do it myself but fuck stop telling me the guy deserves to lose his job."

tfc,35qzvq,kohanz,-2,Wed May 13 03:14:08 2015 UTC,"Oh but I am, it was literally a drunk TV interview gone horribly wrong. He didn't even volunteer to be on TV the reporter seeked him out after the guy said it with that line of questioning. he may have answered too honestly and candidly, but it wasnt him who FHRITP'd CTV, yet she goes to him and says, ""do you think that is funny?"" Is that not a loaded question seeking an answer to use against him in anything following it?"
tfc,35qzvq,blakezed,6,Wed May 13 04:20:13 2015 UTC,"I guess we disagree on whether the vibrator comment is an acceptable thing to say to a woman trying to do her job. It's borderline harassment in my opinion, even if some people think it's a clever internet reference, that doesn't all of a sudden make it funny or acceptable. ""Context"" is meaningless if a small minority of people are in on the joke. He knew he was on TV. She's telling them that she hears it all the time and that its disrespectful, but this guy was unfazed. Drunk or not, that can never be an excuse for crossing the line. It can be an explanation, not an excuse.  I'm going to try and ignore how you're attempting to paint the reporter as a villain here. She didn't fire him. I suppose she should have continued to stay quiet and accept the bs these bros are spewing."
tfc,35qzvq,kohanz,-1,Wed May 13 04:28:52 2015 UTC,"the thing about the dildo reference is that he was talking about the Sky Sports reporter getting a dildo stuffed in his ear live on tv. He wasn't threatening to use a vibrator on her, he didn't just think up ""dildo"".  I agree its childish and unfunny, and no doubt the reporters absolutely hate it, but this guy got vilified for making a drunken remark he probably didn't even remember 5 minutes later. He lost his job because the internet got outraged. Next week it will be someone else, some day it might be you.   At least we've probably heard the end of FHRITP, at least in Toronto, and that's a good thing!"
tfc,35qzvq,arsenefinger,3,Wed May 13 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"I'll repeat it again, the reference is of no consequence in this situation. In the context of the larger population (and that's what you're dealing with when you make a comment on-camera to a reporter), this is a inside joke to a very small community that has very different standards for humour and offensiveness from the general population.  For anyone not in on the ""joke"" (and the vast majority of people would fall into this category), it's a lot more than ""childish and unfunny"". It's offensive at least and from a woman's point of view I wouldn't be surprised if it felt aggressive, threatening, and was a source of fear.  He lost his job because he behaved like a misogynistic ass on television and it happened to go viral. You know who could have prevented this? The guy himself, with a little self-control. This would never happen to me, for multiple reasons (don't get drunk in public, would never say such things either way).  I completely agree that it's good that we won't be hearing this garbage anymore."
tfc,35qzvq,kohanz,-4,Wed May 13 18:07:43 2015 UTC,"Fair point. In no way was any of it appropriate whatsoever, all I'm saying is she kind of directed the conversation in that direction and put him in such a position where those kind of things could be said. That is not to ignore the fact he holds such opinions though and for that he should be accountable."
tfc,35qzvq,blakezed,8,Wed May 13 04:36:01 2015 UTC,"Come on man. She didn't ""direct the conversation."" She properly called these jokers out. This idea that she had to just sit back and take this abuse is exactly the problem. FHRITP had been regularly interfering with her job for more than a year."
tfc,35qzvq,Richard_Swinger_Esq,-1,Wed May 13 11:56:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe I worded it wrong. She didn't call the guy who said it out, she turned around and picked another guy off camera and asked him what he thought instead of asking the guy who said it all these things.

tfc,35qzvq,blakezed,0,Wed May 13 15:49:50 2015 UTC,You do not remember correctly.  It's a reference to a reporter who said live on air that he would have sex with a missing woman if he found her.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJGDtonkqPs&list=PLYR5vb00_UhJ5A9i6fbH-wJ3wDAMUj-zz

tfc,35px8i,jztrumpeter,11,Tue May 12 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"On one hand, it seems a little harsh to ban some drunken idiots who used foul language outside the stadium after the match. I've heard equally nasty language in the south end.  On the other hand, I don't know if their permanent absence will degrade my TFC experience at all. And they did seem like total knobs.  Deserved ban or not, this is nothing more than TFC trying to protect their brand and generate some good PR in the wake of some negative PR.  What I'm really curious about: What limitations does BMO have to ban fans? Do I have to be inside the stadium when the offence occurs? Outside the stadium? 100 feet from the stadium? What about 200 feet?  What about 400 feet? Or if I do something questionable just wearing TFC apparel? What about the colour red? I'm not at all trying to defend those guys, I'm just curious about the implications of this incident."

tfc,35px8i,SasquatchFEVER,0,Wed May 13 15:35:26 2015 UTC,"No first of all he didn't shout anything it was a different guy, the news reporter went looking for that guy but instead spoke to other people in the backround when she started the conversation with this guy.. this is fucking bullshit and sets a wrong example that people can just be fired from their jobs for saying the wrong things in unrelated public events... and Canada is way to sensitive, fuck her right in the pussy is only a phrase made to say swear words on air and not some sexist crap that everyone is trying to make it."
tfc,35px8i,Swervitu,3,Wed May 13 17:08:03 2015 UTC,"So just because it's popular it's alright? If you're making over $100,000 a year (edit: nvm that, because pay shouldn't matter), and are stupid enough to go on camera, shout shit like that, then stay on camera to defend your actions and add on 'you're lucky there isn't a vibrator in your ear', you're a fucking moron who deserves to be fired."

tfc,35px8i,feb914,3,Tue May 12 18:58:12 2015 UTC,You're right. The ban is PR and not much more.
tfc,35px8i,roolb,2,Tue May 12 19:29:10 2015 UTC,It's probably enforced like it is in the rest of the world's stadium. The individual is told that s/he is not welcome at the stadium anymore. And if they do make it to the stadium it will be considered breaking in/trespassing etc. Which means the fan will face legal prosecution if they are spotted at the stadium in the future.  Sounds like a risk big enough that will dissuade the fan from going back.

tfc,35px8i,tmlrule,10,Tue May 12 16:21:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty easy to tell where the line is.   Obviously yelling in general is fine, that happens after every game, you've yelled outside the stadium and so have I, and nobody's received any trouble, let alone bans for it. Starting chants and even swearing off camera won't cause problems either.  The bans here are for a very specific action - shouting something obscene directly into the camera. I don't know why you are worried this will suddenly change everything else fans do around cameras. Not every punishment is a slippery slope. Don't shout obscenities directly into the camera and you'll be fine."

Just because some idiots said stupid things on TV wearing a TFC jersey doesn't mean we as fans have to acknowledge or condemn behaviour that doesn't represent us in the slightest.  If we're going to condemn any behaviour, condemn all the fans that left early when the rain started. At least that is related to being a TFC fan."
tfc,35nnt8,R00K416,9,Tue May 12 00:57:58 2015 UTC,The guy at the end was wearing an Arsenal shirt and I think he is a prick too and I think he shames the club.   They were TFC fans. As fellow TFC fans I think we can do something positive by calling them out on their shit and making it explicit that this isn't behaviour we tolerate.

They are posting the dude's picture on Twitter trying to get a follow up interview with him. Maybe if people realize that they could get publicly outed for shit like this they'd reconsider."

tfc,35nnt8,R00K416,4,Tue May 12 01:45:02 2015 UTC,"I don't want TFC to condemn this as some sort of reactive effort to avoid bad press or somehow being painted with the same brush as these ass hats. I want us to condemn it as a pro-active declaration that this shit won't be stood for amongst our fan base, above and beyond any PR gains we as fans might gain from it."
tfc,35nnt8,JasonTO,5,Tue May 12 03:49:34 2015 UTC,Clearly people tolerate this behaviour. All of these dude's bros thought it was hilarious and the random dickhead in an Arsenal shirt  thought it was such a worthwhile endeavor that he came over to defend it. Did anyone come over and condemn the guy?  Maybe this is the first time that a dude in a TFC did it shirt but it's not an isolated incident.  These reporters are just trying to do their job. Why is it funny to humiliate them? Why is it better to just ignore it than to condemn it?

tfc,35nnt8,R00K416,3,Tue May 12 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"OK I think we mostly agree on this, I just think that it draws attention regardless, so we might as well try and make it negative attention."
tfc,35nnt8,TheArgsenal,2,Tue May 12 02:10:41 2015 UTC,"It's drawing police attention, and widespread condemnation. The people who did this are getting identified and shamed.

tfc,35jer3,Soldado4lyf,7,Mon May 11 00:41:54 2015 UTC,Jackson is absolute bird shit
tfc,35jer3,BasedPython,4,Mon May 11 00:13:52 2015 UTC,He thinks he's Messi and every defender Jerome Boateng (RIP in peace).
tfc,35jer3,mdps,2,Mon May 11 00:17:19 2015 UTC,He played terribly today. But he has been better this year than last. Today was straight out of 2014 for him
tfc,35jer3,mostmodest-,1 point,Mon May 11 00:58:46 2015 UTC,Yea I thought he's been pretty good this year.
tfc,35jer3,mafiazul,1 point,Mon May 11 05:14:33 2015 UTC,i loved how fast he was. but this not a track meet. He did everything else wrong.
tfc,35jer3,hopelessromantic7,5,Mon May 11 03:46:26 2015 UTC,"After Watching the Game, I think Toronto would play best in a 4-2-3-1  Regular 4 at back Cheyrou and Bradley mid with 2 wingers and Giovinco acting almost as CF, and Altidore up front. This way Bradley is free in the middle with Cheyrou covering him, and Giovinco can help with build up play."
tfc,35jer3,TastyTacoTonight,1 point,Mon May 11 01:07:28 2015 UTC,I agree
tfc,35jer3,EasterlyFan,1 point,Mon May 11 04:07:00 2015 UTC,Yep. Play Osorio - Giovinco - Findley / Jackson / Lovitz as the 3.  Osorio needs to be starting.
tfc,35jer3,hopelessromantic7,1 point,Mon May 11 14:35:15 2015 UTC,Exactly you-know-who up front cheyrou and bradley in mid. Our full backs looked good last game. Cant wait until Caldwell returns! And wishing Henry never left :'(
tfc,35jer3,EasterlyFan,1 point,Tue May 12 01:16:39 2015 UTC,"Loved Henry, but I'm excited to see him in the Premier League. I hope he is successful.   If we could get Caldwell back that would be great. I honestly think Ashton Morgan may be a better option than either Creavalle or Bloom as a Fulllback. Morrow really doesn't look out of place on the Right, this is kind of working."
tfc,35jer3,human_after_all_,4,Tue May 12 11:56:42 2015 UTC,"Bradley won't have a game like this the rest of the year. Unlucky. Support was amazing, especially when that rain hit."

tfc,35jer3,mdps,5,Mon May 11 00:27:47 2015 UTC,"I was there also and I was disappointed overall. The supporters section was strong and carried the house. But the poor play brought the atmosphere down early, I thought. Until the last 10 minutes or so."
tfc,35jer3,northdancer,-4,Mon May 11 00:57:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm getting downvoted but it sounded like a wine and cheese crowd. Can't really blame them though, TFC looked uninterested for 75 minutes and that was reflected in the support."
tfc,35jer3,R00K416,2,Mon May 11 01:16:56 2015 UTC,"I sat in section 204 today, I was surrounded by mostly families with small kids. A lot of people started to leave as soon as the rain started.  Supporter's Section is the only place to sit. I'm not going anywhere else from now on."

tfc,35jer3,R00K416,3,Mon May 11 03:51:21 2015 UTC,The literal definition of a fair weather fan.   My ass hurt from having to sit down for so much of the game. Not doing that again.

tfc,35jer3,Makelevi,4,Wed May 13 01:59:49 2015 UTC,"Cheyrou and Bradley had bad, bad days.  Konopka was good yet again. Feel bad for him on the penalty rebound.  Altidore is killer with his headers. That 11th minute chance of his had me out of my seat, too.  Jackson or Findley...I dunno which, but one of them needs to lose their starting spot to Osorio."
tfc,35jer3,EasterlyFan,1 point,Mon May 11 03:09:10 2015 UTC,"I'd probably vote Findley, as bad as Jackson played."
tfc,35jer3,BasedPython,8,Mon May 11 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"Boring, boring, hoofball when you're losing at least half of the aerial battles.   WTF would the ref blow the whistle before a corner instead of after it clears out?"
tfc,35jer3,BleedBlueAndWhite,15,Sun May 10 23:31:10 2015 UTC,Not getting that last corner was bullshit.
tfc,35jer3,mdps,1 point,Sun May 10 23:32:21 2015 UTC,"Too often the defenders today got the ball and made no effort to play out. I know they've gotten some excellent goals on long passes this year, but that wasn't working today."
tfc,35jer3,drretro,2,Mon May 11 01:01:45 2015 UTC,"Osorio did pretty good when he came on; I think he should have been started, honestly. Bradley was awful. He does that; some games he steps up and is the boss and others he just flounders (see also: Aug. 30 2014). The Houston coach was an absolute cock. I sat behind him and he would not shut up for 90 minutes straight; always screaming at someone and always being ignored. Houston also took their sweet time recovering from a couple of fouls and some questionable ones. There was at least one penalty that should have been called Toronto's way. All in all; a shit show and - bottom lining it here - not good enough."
tfc,35jer3,R00K416,2,Mon May 11 03:20:53 2015 UTC,"We looked timid in our first game at home in front of a record 30,000. Houston had absolutely no pressure coming into this game and they looked like the more relaxed team. You're likely to drop points in any game where you concede a penalty. It was a mistake by Bradley. I have questions about both the formation and squad selections. Osorio deserves to be starting games. Findley and Jackson are equally frustrating to watch. Houston scored on the play but I'm really happy Konopka made the initial save on the penalty. He isn't that good of a keeper but I respect a guy that shows up to work everyday knowing that he's not supposed to be playing. One could argue that minus the penalty, we draw 1-1 in this game. One could also argue that we didn't look like we were going to do anything with the ball until after we went down 2-0. I expect we'll turn it around at home quickly. 7 of the next 9 games are at BMO."
tfc,35jer3,Shlongus,2,Mon May 11 04:10:45 2015 UTC,Konopka has been decent in net since Bendik has gone down.   I was at the game today and Bradley was pretty bad. The team as a whole looks like it two separate teams as in the quality players are not meshing with the lesser quality guys.   It seemed the whole TFC attack was trying to force a long ball or set piece which is extremely problematic.   Why they went 4-4-2 completely floored me. Didn't make sense and it didn't work at all. I'm nothing more than an armchair manager but it would make sense to me to drop Giovinco deeper and let him see more of the ball rather forcing to the ball to him in tight spots. and Osorio looked great when he came on so he should get a start next game. TFC should try to find a defender to play with Perquis because he can't do it by himself and Hagguland was pretty bad today.
tfc,35jer3,rosicky7t,1 point,Mon May 11 04:15:04 2015 UTC,"osorio should tuck in to the right and jackson (despite his faults) on the left - his pace is useful. bradley was uninspiring today as was many of our clear chances such as cheyrou free header, bradley left foot volley. for a home opener i expected more fight."
tfc,35jer3,Makelevi,1 point,Mon May 11 02:26:23 2015 UTC,"Anyone else catch the billboard saying ""Jonathan Osario"" when he came on?   You'd think they'd spell check the names!"
tfc,35jer3,goonerdavid,-1,Mon May 11 03:11:24 2015 UTC,"Was at the game.. holy hell I expected more for the home opener. Not only from the fans but from the team as well. Thought they looked super lethargic and weren't playing like a team that just came back from a 7 game road trip. Bradley had a bad game, that penalty laughable, really bad tackle. Giovinco didn't get to do anything, was really impressed by Altidore, Findley was invisible, Cheyrou was invisble, Jackson is a nuisance. That back like needs to figure itself out fast. Pretty disappointing over all, moving on.."

I was thinking about it but decided to just watch it in the house, pretty glad I did at the moment given how things are going.

tfc,35iasv,commradepolski,1 point,Mon May 11 17:47:45 2015 UTC,I don't think TFC sells out anymore especially now with the expansion I don't think they'll sell out. I always get my tickets at the box office before the game. I get there about 2 hours early to avoid the line. Then head over to Brazen Head for some pre game drinks. That's where everyone goes before. Also try Kijiji I saw a ton of canadian cup tickets on there. It should be fun.
tfc,35gudy,TastyTacoTonight,5,Sun May 10 05:36:27 2015 UTC,TWN doesn't know shit! Bet you it rains very briefly at a couple points but the sun remains out. You heard it here first

Be smart about it."

They don't allow umbrellas in the stadium, and stealing them from the beer gardens will only get you kicked out of the stadium (I've seen it happen in 220).  If there is thunder there is a very good chance the game will be cancelled so be prepared.  Standing outside waiting for the GoTrain will not be a fun experience, again, bring a poncho."

I'm not actually Canadian, but for better or for worse, my Canadian relatives often joke I'm more Canadian than they are...  Anyway, I follow TFC because it's the closest MLS team that's not based in Columbus or Chicago (they can go fuck themselves). Coincidentally, not long after following them as a team, they signed Michael Bradley who was at that time my favorite American player. Now that they've picked up Altidore too, I think I'm going to be cemented as a fan for a long time.  If Detroit ever gets a team, that will probably supplant TFC as the #1 in my eyes, but until/if that day comes, I'll be a Red until I die."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place."

Leiweke dodged the question saying that, ""the focus is on this Sunday"".

tfc,35a50l,boomcha,2,Fri May 8 15:43:47 2015 UTC,So who's bringing the No Argos At BMO banner this weekend?
tfc,35a50l,quelar,2,Fri May 8 18:49:10 2015 UTC,There's a reason they haven't announced it yet. They don't want the home opener to be marred with protest.  I hope they miscalculated.

We came out with a weaker than regular side, some of our B team got much needed game time, some of our starters got some rest and should be more fit for the home opener, and we came home in a good position to finish this off next week.  Coming into Montreal with all of our dicks swinging would have been a mistake, imo."
tfc,356jr2,warpus,5,Thu May 7 17:06:50 2015 UTC,They need to give the backups game time.  But I don't think the Cup games are less important.  I'd rather one or two backups sprinkled in with the regulars every game (whether Cup or regular season).
tfc,356jr2,dejour,7,Thu May 7 18:00:53 2015 UTC,Wholeheartedly agreed.   Could you imagine the uproar that would take place if Giovinco & Altidore started as well and one of the DPs got injured? The uproar would be stupendous.  Vanney took the level headed option and that's something I can get behind.
tfc,356jr2,denMAR,-1,Thu May 7 17:25:32 2015 UTC,Which is what I said.
tfc,356jr2,dejour,6,Thu May 7 19:45:31 2015 UTC,Most of the exciting moments for Canadian teams have come from the Champions league.  It should be at least as important as a regular season game.
tfc,356jr2,Bdog5,2,Thu May 7 16:16:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd like to see them take it seriously. I understand resting players for the home opener and all but I want a good team to play wednesday.   I've had to play back to back games before, playing twice in 3 days should be possible for these guys. Play a weaker team next week if they have to."
tfc,356jr2,errboi,2,Thu May 7 16:28:53 2015 UTC,"Sure playing 2 games in a row is possible, but it's also gonna lead to burn out and increased risk of injury as the season goes on. That's not something I'd risk given our current injury situation."
tfc,356jr2,mostmodest-,2,Thu May 7 22:47:32 2015 UTC,I'm with ya. It's too bad that half of our supporters don't care about this competition and wouldn't mind losing to Montreal .. pukes.
tfc,356jr2,EasterlyFan,2,Thu May 7 16:30:55 2015 UTC,Signed. 100%.  You're absolutely right OP. I would absolutely sacrifice the 3 points against New England if it came to that.
tfc,356jr2,R00K416,3,Thu May 7 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think it's that big a deal. I think the playoffs are still the #1 goal and it's not like we're top of the table right now.  Montreal isn't even that good, all we need is to score a goal to push it to penalties, two goals puts us through. We could run an identical lineup minus Delgado & Lovitz for Seba & Jozy for the first half and win the game."
tfc,356jr2,discostu81,1 point,Thu May 7 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"Also, my parents are coming over for a visit from England so my Dad and I are going...I would like him to be able to see the team he watches on Sky Sports, not the B team.  Selfish but whatever."
tfc,356jr2,dejour,1 point,Thu May 7 15:38:08 2015 UTC,"You know, the more I think about this, the more I think it's about incentives.  I personally would rather win the Canadian championship rather than a given regular season game.  However, I suspect Vanney knows his job is on the line.  No playoffs means he is fired.  Winning the Canadian championship means little and surely wouldn't be enough to save his job on its own.  The same situation might be facing others (eg. Bezbatchenko).  Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if the staff talked and agreed to prioritize the league.  The only way around this would be for senior execs to explicitly say that the Canadian championship should be a priority.  (And they may not feel that way, since TFC in the playoffs would be seen as a mild success by the local media, while TFC winning the Canadian championship would be seen as the same old thing.)"
tfc,356jr2,mostmodest-,2,Thu May 7 18:18:09 2015 UTC,Thing is this team has more than enough quality to finish 6th and still put out a strong lineup in the cup.  We have one of the highest team salary in the league. We should be able to field a competitive side in all competitions.  The Canadian championship is so short and the reward is so massive that it make no sense to play a weakened lineup.

tfc,356jr2,sfw84,1 point,Fri May 8 06:43:23 2015 UTC,Winning the league doesn't prevent us from making the CCL. It just isn't an avenue of qualification. The only way a Canadian team can make the CCL is by winning the Canadian Championship. How well they do in the league is irrelevant.
tfc,356jr2,sfw84,1 point,Fri May 8 11:01:10 2015 UTC,"right but ways to qualify include winning the mls cup, or the supporters shield in the mls. it's just that a canadian team has never won any of these yet, and would be pretty fucking stupid if say vancouver wins the mls cup, but can't play in the champions league because they're not the american team you know? be like not letting cardiff city not being allowed in uefas champions league if they somehow won the epl because they're not an english team even though they play in their pyramid is how i see it"

tfc,355qzt,Menessy27,2,Thu May 7 14:26:31 2015 UTC,Should have brought in Hamilton for Osorio. Osorio really struggled and Moore had no help at all. Other than that the game and result were fine.

tfc,355qzt,Coramoor_,1 point,Thu May 7 18:07:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree, the issue was less Osorio and more where he was being played, if they had replaced Bradley with Hamilton and dropped Osorio back, it probably would've been better."

tfc,34y0vz,BanksKnowsBest,3,Tue May 5 14:34:28 2015 UTC,It seems clear that TFC will not field anything close to its best team for this. What is the thinking behind Montreal? Is the emphasis on the ACC or on recovering its MLS season?
tfc,34y0vz,mdps,5,Tue May 5 17:00:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think they need to ""recover"" their MLS season at this point. They've only played 4 games so far."
tfc,34y0vz,errboi,3,Tue May 5 20:59:36 2015 UTC,"it is the best defense though, looks like they are going to play for a draw and try to win at home"
tfc,34y0vz,Coramoor_,3,Tue May 5 21:15:35 2015 UTC,Montreal isn't having a great week.  Let's make it worse for them.
tfc,34thnj,quelar,18,Mon May 4 12:52:02 2015 UTC,"The Canadian Championship is a bit stale, isn’t it?   Uh, Larson just advocating getting rid of our national cup competitions, turning it into a fan-styled cup competition, and excluding the NASL clubs.  Fuck that shit."
tfc,34thnj,now_we_here,6,Mon May 4 13:19:10 2015 UTC,"If there are 10k fans next week I'll be amazed.  That said, I don't think he's wrong, really. The current tournament format is very abrupt, and typically means minutes for fringe players. I think the head to head MLS matches would be a better format that the current five team format.  That said, I'd love to see a much broader cup competition like USOC. Regional qualifiers, include the whole pyramid, MLS clubs join at quarter final stage. Make it single leg, shared gate. Final on Labour Day."
tfc,34thnj,a_lumberjack,6,Mon May 4 14:26:54 2015 UTC,I think we're moving towards a broader cup competition. Give it a few years and you'll see some more teams added.
tfc,34thnj,errboi,2,Mon May 4 16:16:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's definitely part of the shift to the schedule. I'd love to see some random semi-pro team make a run, end up at BMO Field."

tfc,34thnj,TheDarkRedKnight,1 point,Tue May 5 01:22:13 2015 UTC,There are already changes in the works within the CSA to broaden the Voyageurs Cup competition.  Last dates I heard were expect the changes in 2017.

tfc,34thnj,a_lumberjack,7,Mon May 4 20:48:10 2015 UTC,"So, normally we are offered two things by the Toronto media, the first is a whole pile of ""who gives a fuck"" that ignores our existence, the second is the occasional ""TFC is shit, always have been, and always will be"" kind of pieces.  Even more surprising is that this article came from the Toronto Sun, a football hating rag that spends more time courting controversy than actual news so I have to say I was pleased to read through this.   I do however have to take exception to this line.   In the middle, do you automatically reinsert Caldwell when Hagglund is doing an adequate job?   I'm not sure if getting completely dummied twice against Dallas and costing us goals is an ""adequate job"", but I do like Nick and hopes he continues to rebound from that debacle."
tfc,34thnj,a_lumberjack,12,Mon May 4 12:58:10 2015 UTC,"Hagglund is doing fine at CB. At RB he's easily exposed. With Morrow at RB and Perquis at CB, he's been fine."

tfc,34thnj,sfw84,2,Mon May 4 16:21:33 2015 UTC,"Not the same thing at all... the Voyageurs Cup is a reserve tournament at this point. The Champions League is obviously not. And the League Cup and Copa Del Rey don't give teams a spot in the Champions League.  Larson is saying that by doing it through the league you actually have full strength teams deciding who goes into the Champions League, and he's not wrong at all"

If the Canadian Championship put a team into a Europa League type of competition with the 8th placed teams from Mexico/MLS and teams from countries like Cuba, Dominica, Grenada and St Lucia then that would make it similar to the League Cup or Copa del Rey."

Lovitz              Oso                 Moore   The CB pairing is really inexperienced and Morgan is forced to play LB. Chapman and Delgado are question marks. Moore is set in stone for FW I think."

tfc,34qn4c,Coramoor_,2,Mon May 4 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"I'd like to take this fairly seriously, but I also think probably our DPs will rest. Maybe Bradley will be on the field? I just keep thinking back to his interview a few weeks ago (after the MNT games) where he talked about how its not a problem for him to play two games in one week at this stage of the season.  I want to win the Canadian Championship. I want to make it to the Champion's League. Montreal's run was exciting as fuck, but I want to watch Toronto take on Mexico, not the Impact.  We'll use some depth for sure. I'm predicting the following:  Roberts  Morgan - Hagglund - Simonin - Creavalle  Lovitz - Bradley - Warner - Osorio  Moore - Findley"

tfc,34qn4c,cctoronto,2,Sun May 3 21:10:52 2015 UTC,"I don't have a clue. I'm not sure how seriously we should take this game, or what our fitness levels are like.  I think the five players guaranteed to start are Warner, Lovitz, Osorio, Creavlle, and Moore. I think Zavaleta deserves a start as well, we haven't seen him in action yet. And I have a feeling Jay Chapman will make an appearance.  How seriously are we taking the Montreal game though? I would think the home opener has to be our priority, the fans deserve the best line-up possible. Do we sit Jozy, Bradley, and Giovinco? What about our better non-DP players like Perquis, Cheyrou, and Morrow?  And do we go with Konopka or Roberts? Part of me thinks Konopka deserves it after getting the job done yesterday, but these games are important and good experience for our future starter in Roberts."
tfc,34qn4c,R00K416,1 point,Sun May 3 20:39:44 2015 UTC,A strong one. The CCL is a big deal. 4 extra games won't ruin our playoff chances (we have that locked up anyway http://www.sportsclubstats.com/USA/TorontoFC.html ).  Win this game 2-0+ and then we can get away with resting some starters in the return leg.

tfc,34jq8g,TorontoFC15,4,Fri May 1 19:09:05 2015 UTC,"Philly fan here.  About the protests: they are far from the stadium (in fact, the stadium isn't technically even in Philadelphia).  That being said, if you're coming up to the area, there might be disruptions around broad as stated in the original post.  There was a little scuffle between some protesters and the police, but nothing too crazy.    Also to the person who posted in the comment: "" Philly is a disaster so far this year.""  You nailed it.  I don't know what to expect from this game.  We've had a lot of injuries, are using our 3rd string keeper, but on the other hand Curtin is changing the lineup a decent amount after the Columbus failure.    I fully expect to see Letoux and Wegner both sitting, who have been for lack of a better word, just sucking this year.  If he puts Ayuk, Aristeguieta (who's been injured), and Sapong on top expect a dangerous front with service from Maidana.  I'm not overly optimistic with the disaster I've watched this season, but at the same time, expect a highly motivated attack.  At BEST for Union, I'm expecting a draw."

tfc,34jq8g,StJohnsFog,2,Fri May 1 22:47:10 2015 UTC,"I'd be disappointed with nothing less than. Win. Honestly, 9 points from 7 away games is tolerable. Not in any way ideal, but I'd say the road trip would be tolerable.   Can Philly pull something out? With no Bendik, we do have an unknown. I'm hoping to line up the same as last week.

tfc,34jx4u,Swervitu,3,Sat May 2 10:11:12 2015 UTC,"Alberto Aquilani is ready to start the next chapter of his career. As reported by Manuele Baiocchini, the midfielder won't extend his contract with Fiorentina, his current deal expires on June 30th. The player's entourage met with Fiorentina about a month and a half ago and there have been no contacts since then. Initially the Tuscan club's president Della Valle wanted to keep Aquilani but issues with the negotiation have changed all of the parties intentions. Aquilani also recently switched agents and hired Andrea D'Amico who facilitated Giovinco's move to MLS earlier this year. Aquilani is intrigued by the possibility of playing in North America, and Toronto is monitoring the situation- it's possible Aquilani could be reunited with Giovinco.   Usually Di Marzio is the best when it comes to truth in rumors. I think there is a very strong chance that Aquilani will end up in Toronto next year."
tfc,34jx4u,Swervitu,2,Fri May 1 20:07:51 2015 UTC,"umm highly doubt hed come for anything under a dp contract lol, his salary was like 10 million cdn a year a couple years ago if not still. So unless 4th dp spot i doubt we get him though he would be perfect to replace osorio and have us play possession ball."
tfc,34jx4u,Xenotheos,2,Fri May 1 20:44:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I had trouble finding his current salary but the only place I could find said 3.2M US. The new player rules have been released and there is no 4th DP spot so it's not happening.
tfc,34jx4u,errboi,1 point,Fri May 1 21:37:22 2015 UTC,"True, though the initial DP rules were added outside of CBA negotiations, so it's possible that they could add another DP slot mid season or in the off season."

Then of course a week later, I get an email from work (I work at Real Sports which is obviously part of MLSE) telling me that they have some available for $35 for MLSE employees.  Pants pulled down but such is life.  As long as I'm there, I can live with a financial spanking."

tfc,34imnt,joshuawakefield,5,Fri May 1 16:49:30 2015 UTC,"Face value. You didn't buy the season tickets to make a profit, but if you can't make a match, might as well get your money back if you are able. Wouldn't feel right gouging another TFC fan."

Like a lot of the other subreddits, we have found it best to just stay away from the issue all together. Craigslist and kijiji are very popular for ticket resales and aren't charging exorbitant fees like stubhub. Often times, you will see a pair go for the price of one ticket."

tfc,34ejmb,BanksKnowsBest,5,Thu Apr 30 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"I found these parts interesting   On Friday, outgoing MLSE CEO Tim Leiweke told the Exhibition Place board that the clock had ticked down to 10 days (May 4) to allow enough time to alter construction plans so the soccer field can accommodate football in time for the 2016 season.   Could be just posturing, it seems that the way they're upgrading the stadium in phases would leave for the Argos to move in even after the roof is installed.  I mean, they're not touching the north stand at all, and I thought it was for this reason.  Then again, maybe I don't know something that Tim does, which has happened before.   Rogers is playing hard ball with this deal, according to sources and previous reports. Rogers owns Sportsnet, a competing network, and doesn’t stand to gain much from a deal.   Good."

I mean, this hasn't stopped TFC in regards to players like Giovinco, so if they really wanted him, I don't think this would stop them.  That said with Altidore, Giovinco and Bradley here, I don't see TFC dropping any of our existing 3 DPs to bring in a 32 year old.  I feel like next season will (finally) see a focus on defense."
tfc,34et0v,Makelevi,1 point,Fri May 1 14:23:13 2015 UTC,Sucks to have all these players linked and know we can't get them because the DP threshold and the salary cap are so low. It's not like Atiba would come in making 2 million or something but we can't even give him 450k

That said, my #1 priority for is growth of soccer in North America, and I just want to see MLS win that damn tournament. As much as I might dislike the Impact in regular season, I also love an underdog story, and I love seeing an MLS team go deep.   I dunno, I wanted to see them succeed. I'm not devastated, because now Toronto can still be the first, but I certainly would rather see Montreal win over those fuckers at Club America. I hate that team so much more."

He also went to watch other players on other teams in Italy, plus apparently will visit Spain and France as well so I wouldn't put much stock into it. Nocerino is the biggest name by far though  Serie A is an interesting target because very few Italian players are interested in playing outside of Italy. But if Italian teams aren't really interested or the situations/offers aren't great then we could be an interesting destination with a large Italian community, an Italian star in Giovinco, and increasing Italian links including a possible Italian CEO (or whatever the position is) replacing Leiweke. We're probably the biggest Italian community outside of Italy, and Italians normally have a pretty favourable opinion on MLS, plus we have Giovinco's agent helping Bez out apparently.  Nocerino would be an amazing non-DP signing but I can't see him coming for cheap enough to fit him in. I think we will end up signing a cheaper player from either Parma or Serie B, possibly a young player on loan"

tfc,345d15,Define_It,2,Tue Apr 28 20:21:52 2015 UTC,"I may have exaggerated with lots... One or two per year, usually in the middle of the summer.   June 14, 2014 - Canada vs Scotland November 3, 2013 - Canada vs Māori All Blacks August 24, 2013 - Canada vs USA June 13, 2013 - Canada vs Ireland June 15, 2012 - Canada vs Italy   This year there will be no exception, due to a triple header for the Pacific Nations Cup (July 29), and Rugby Sevens during the Pan Am Games.  I figure if rugby & soccer can co-exist, so can the CFL, with it's 8 game per year schedule (especially since the last couple weeks will be after the MLS season ends)."
tfc,345d15,mattgrande,2,Tue Apr 28 21:09:54 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how one draws a parallel between 5 rugby games over 3 years (1 of which was played at the end of TFC's season) and 8-10 football games in one year.
tfc,345d15,onlynickleft,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:55:08 2015 UTC,"I just think the frequency of games played will be too much for BMO's grass to handle, that's all. I don't want the Argos to cease to exist. I just want them to find their own stadium seeing as their problems are of their own design."
tfc,345d15,onlynickleft,2,Wed Apr 29 12:00:52 2015 UTC,"Good luck but we all know what is happening. It's ironic that fans that consider themselves a Canadian institution have no issues destroying the grass for their national soccer team. I'd have more sympathy for Argo fans if they cared at all about how it will affect soccer. They're quick to mention shared venues like in Seattle or Vancouver, not knowing they play on plastic. Hybrid grass and scheduling won't make a difference after an Argos game in pouring rain."

tfc,345d15,AL-MO4,5,Tue Apr 28 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"MLSE has never given a crap about what the fans think, they aren't about to start now.    Yeah; not buying it.  We asked for grass. We got it. We wanted designated players? We go them. We wanted stadium improvements? We got them. ""MLSE doesn't spend money!  They're cheap!"" No. In fact they aren't.  Has the team itself and it's management been a bit of a shitshow? Absolutely. I certainly wouldn't dispute that.  But the ""MLSE doesn't give a damn and has tight purse strings"" arguments really don't fly in the face of the facts."
tfc,345d15,onlynickleft,2,Tue Apr 28 20:19:17 2015 UTC,"I never said they had tight purse strings.  I said they don't care, and given that I've personally dealt with the front office and sat in meetings with them I see no evidence otherwise.  Spending money on players is just to paper over the fact that they don't care.   They just figured out how to get the Italians out.  Next is a Portuguese DP and then after that a Greek one.  They'll have all their boxes checked.   Don't be confused... A multi-billion dollar organization doesn't give a shit about you or a few hundred other active supporters.  (Which pains me to say - but it's the truth)"
tfc,345d15,AL-MO4,2,Tue Apr 28 21:47:28 2015 UTC,"So in what way do they not care? stop speaking in generalities and provide some evidence.   Oh ya poor us having to deal with MLSE signing a DP to cater to the Italian community as if he isn't arguably the best player in the league and on the right side of 30... oh ya what an uncaring move that was. I hope they don't sign Ronaldo to cater to the Portuguese community, what an uncaring shitshow that would be by MLSE."

Rogers doesn't it.   If you want to vote with your wallet, don't wait, do it now.   Season tickets are purchased already and the decision hasn't been finalized yet.  I'll wait and see.   I'm sick and tired of all the pissing and moaning about how people are 'done' with the team.   Never said I was done.   Stop loudly telling everyone that you're done and just be done.

Yeah well, I'm sorry but I've had too much ""trivia"" with TFC as it has been.    Do you remember that game where we had to sign a bunch of people for a single game? I do.  Do you remember the now three almost washed out, and two completely replayed games?  I do.  Do you remember breaking the goal-less streak and win-less streak? I do.  Do you remember a number of other futile records we've managed to break? I do.  I'm not laughing."
tfc,341sjh,neuron_fc,5,Mon Apr 27 17:09:20 2015 UTC,Good luck to him
tfc,341sjh,TorontoFC15,3,Mon Apr 27 18:10:10 2015 UTC,Really wish Vaney gave him more minutes to prove himself. He's had a tough time with injuries and finally got healthy. I think he would have been more productive than Findley up front earlier on this season. Good luck to him.
tfc,341sjh,Acceptable_Casualty,2,Mon Apr 27 21:20:22 2015 UTC,"Starting minutes in the NASL might exactly what Dike needs. There's a lot of competition in the striker department here, I can't see him getting much more than super sub minutes all season if he were to stay."
tfc,341sjh,juanroberto,2,Mon Apr 27 22:25:26 2015 UTC,"The guy's got a goal against Italy, and he's playing in the NASL.  I think that says a ton about our depth."
tfc,341sjh,now_we_here,3,Mon Apr 27 21:52:19 2015 UTC,Forward depth for sure.   Still nervous about another injury on the back line.
tfc,341sjh,quelar,2,Tue Apr 28 00:43:40 2015 UTC,"Wish we'd sent him to a Canadian NASL team. If they are paying a player's wages at another club, why not help a brother out?"
tfc,341sjh,KSenCSmith,2,Tue Apr 28 03:45:45 2015 UTC,Not sure why he wasn't loaned to TFCII.
tfc,341sjh,OtterBurger,9,Mon Apr 27 17:18:15 2015 UTC,NASL is a higher calibre of competition and leaves those USL roster spots available for our developing players.
tfc,341sjh,errboi,3,Mon Apr 27 17:37:02 2015 UTC,"It might also have to do with roster space. The club is only allowed one ""season long"" loan to TFC II that frees up a roster spot, while there is no such stipulation on loaning to unaffiliated clubs. With all the rumours of us looking at players in Europe right now it would make sense to move someone out like this. We're either putting Dike on display to help move him permanently, or we're making room for a loaned player of our own in the summer. At least that's my guess."
tfc,341sjh,EasterlyFan,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"We've got depth at Forward, that's for sure, but I always like Dike. I think he can do more than he's had a chance to do. He also strikes me as a pretty like-for-like option in the event Altidore ever can't play.  I like him more than Moore, honestly. And I believe he is cheaper.  Good luck to him. If we can't use him, I'm happy he is playing and not rotting on our bench."

tfc,33zaid,Bdog5,4,Mon Apr 27 01:15:23 2015 UTC,I know that firing coaches every year looks bad but they really could have gotten a better coach. Let him stay for the season but someone with experience would be good in the future.

tfc,33zaid,errboi,3,Mon Apr 27 01:47:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Let him stick it out for the season. And the season after that. And if we're in a good place at that point then please, for the love of all that is holy, don't Petke him."
tfc,33zaid,Matt872000,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:21:54 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, let him stay for a good time but IF he was to be fired he would need to be replaced by someone more experienced."
tfc,33zaid,MasochisticLeafsFan,2,Mon Apr 27 09:58:17 2015 UTC,"You say 1 PPG as if we've been consistent and eeked out a few draws, getting 2 wins and 4 losses isn't quite that."
tfc,33zaid,Coramoor_,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:32:27 2015 UTC,it's 7 games on the road with a lot of new players. It is going to take time to gel and all that. Realistically TFC should be 2-3-1 with 7 points in 6 games due to atrocious referring in the RSL game. Assuming a result of some kind against Philly. It's 1 PPG and the hardest stretch of the season is over with an advantageous schedule going forward. I can't complain about that especially given the injury issues that the team has faced.
tfc,33zaid,Carefree_CFC,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:37:56 2015 UTC,"Beating an expansion team won't change many opinions, unfortunately.   Most fans are critical because they're worried by Vanney's simple tactical errors (The Hagglund, Castillo, mismatch being the most obvious), and not simply because of results. Personally, I am worried about his ability to recognize threats, however, this seems like a simple lack of experience.   Today Vanney nailed it. In the second half v RSL he nailed it (not inc. the end). 2nd half of Vancouver he nailed it. There are many times where you can see his tactical influence on the match, and not just because of the quality of the players he has... Finding consistency is key for him and that comes with experience.  Patience is what fans need to give him (something hard to find living in Toronto)."
tfc,33zaid,mdps,2,Mon Apr 27 04:51:34 2015 UTC,"You've touched on one of Vanney's emerging strengths. His half-time adjustments have been excellent in many games (Vancouver, RSL, Dallas, Orlando)."
tfc,33zaid,Richard_Swinger_Esq,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:43:28 2015 UTC,"Most of the criticism of Vanney is his inexperience. As you say, his inexperience leads to simple tactical errors. This isn't like the usual cries for ""coach out"" because the fans think the coach is terrible. Vanney clearly shows promise, but he needs to hone his craft. People are ticked the mgmt didn't hire an experienced coach in the off season."
tfc,33zaid,EasterlyFan,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:39:56 2015 UTC,"I wish that an experienced coach had been hired as well. That's what should have happened.  That said, that's NOT what happened, but Vanney DOES show promise. Instead of blowing it up again, I'm really a big advocate of sucking it up while he works out the kinks. Vanney knows what he's talking about and he has had some of the weirdest circumstances I've seen a new coach deal with. I'm cutting him some slack. I think he can get us to the playoffs."
tfc,33zaid,Richard_Swinger_Esq,2,Mon Apr 27 09:55:21 2015 UTC,"Nobody's saying we should blow it up. We need an experienced coach to guide the team in place. We can't wait 5 years for Vanney to become experienced. And, that's what we mean by experience, not a few more games. Nobody worth listening to is advocating sacking him for the sake of it, or for replacing him with another novice. This team is missing a proper coach to skipper a team of real contenders. Making the playoffs is great, but winning is better. Look at what just happened to the Raptors. That was wholly disappointing. The reality is that finding a suitable replacement is unlikely this year, so Vanney should stay."
tfc,33zaid,StJohnsFog,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:16:39 2015 UTC,"Yep. I know you weren't suggesting it, but there certainly were a fair number on this sub last week who were."

Anyone else remember that one?   Overall though, solid performance... Another winnable game V Philly next week. Let's hope Vanney can prove his critics wrong, because he's dug himself a deep hole."
tfc,33zaid,EasterlyFan,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:26:18 2015 UTC,"The team looked great today, no notable weak links. I've been waiting for this game, because I think we needed to play a team like Orlando to get our stride back. I'm hoping for more magic in Philly.  After that, TFC is back home.

I don't find pleasure in canning Vanney, I won't be 'thrilled' that he's gone. It's just that he's not the right man to lead this team.

Sorry, TFC fan since inception here...I'll show myself and my pessimism out."
tfc,335sn4,EasterlyFan,9,Sun Apr 19 20:40:30 2015 UTC,"So I think that Vanney will catch a lot of flak for his Hagglund/Morrow starting spots last night, and while in hindsight it was a massive let down, I think at the time there was reason to think it would be effective. Last year when Bloom was injured or in need of rest, Hagglund stepped in as the backup RB and acquitted himself fairly well. Morrow was brought in as a starter at LB and depth at CB. Morgan has experienced something of a career renaissance in Vanney's attack minded system, and has looked reasonably competent (for a backup player) both in defense and in attack this year. Morgan is perhaps the only backup player who has actually performed even remotely well this year, so it makes sense to find a way to fit him into the back line when our depth is stretched like it is. On paper having Hagglund at RB (where he had been serviceable in the past) and Morrow at CB (where he has also been serviceable in the past) seems like a fairly reasonable thing to do, while starting Morrow on the right would have been more of a question mark since many fullbacks aren't capable of playing both sides of the field with any measure of competence."
tfc,335sn4,errboi,2,Sun Apr 19 22:03:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, and while it looked awful, it was reasonable when I saw the Starting XI. I hated the look of the backline due to missing Bloom and Caldwell, and having Morrow as a CB, but it seemed like one of the only reasonable options.  After seeing it I will be mad in Vanney plays Hagglund in that position again. Don't make the same mistake twice. I didn't mind that he tried it once though. It made sense to me too."
tfc,335sn4,Menessy27,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:01:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Hagglund was very good at right back last season. There was no predicting he would be awful like that. And I don't believe Morrow has ever played right back, plus being a lefty makes it very difficult on the right side."

tfc,335sn4,Richard_Swinger_Esq,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:49:24 2015 UTC,"For me it's less about a reactionary ""Vanney out!"" and more about ""why didn't we get an experienced coach ?""  We can't just look at this year. His record is 3-10-2. Vanney might just turn into one of the great MLS coaches, but right now he's too green. The head coaching job at TFC should not be on the job training - at least not now.   So, for me, and others, this isn't knee jerk. It's confirming what we said when Nelsen was sacked. There was no logic in replacing an inexperienced coach with a less experienced coach.   That said, your analysis about this year is bang on. Every team goes through slumps. We can't hit the panic button after a single bad run. We part company on how far back we're looking."
tfc,335sn4,Richard_Swinger_Esq,2,Mon Apr 20 12:14:28 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I would very much have preferred to see TFC bring in a coach with the experience of say... Schmid or Arena, than Vanney. I wasn't thrilled about Vanney, I'm still not thrilled about Vanney.  However, I see glimmers of hope, and more so than I did with Nelsen, I want to give Vanney a bit of time. I see the positive changes he has made to TFC's style, as outlined above, and I can't help but feel like those changes will be translated into results. I also genuinely can't fault him for his record. First five games of this season have been weird as fuck, and last season he came into a nuclear locker-room where players had checked out. Maybe a more experienced coach would have been able to motivate some of the guys effected by Defoe and the negative press, but for a new coach he had an impossible task. That was a very, very hard situation to be in as a new coach. I don't disagree that it probably SHOULDN'T have been a new coach, but it was. He couldn't teach his new style until the off-season, he couldn't implement his ideas until the off-season, he couldn't bring players in that suited him until the off-season. He essentially had 9 or 10 games to try and salvage Nelsen's season. He failed, but that doesn't mean he is awful.  I want to see what he can do with a half season / full season of doing things his way. Based on the stats above, if he can tighten up our defence we have all the other pieces to be an incredibly dangerous team. High energy. Maintain possession. Passing accuracy. A deadly attack that can come from multiple places. He just has to fix defence, and our defence wouldn't be that bad if we hadn't been as unlucky as we have been."
tfc,335sn4,MLSNHL,2,Mon Apr 20 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"All fair. And, we're stuck with him. There's nobody available who would be enough of an upgrade to justify his sacking."

tfc,335sn4,Jessiah,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:21:17 2015 UTC,yea nothing against vanney but no experience there at all. with the players we have we need a coach with experience. I believe we have a playoff team and with a good manager we could see the potential this team has. imo i wish we got owen coyle i think he could have done good things with tfc.

tfc,334gpy,Cashshadow12,6,Sun Apr 19 14:08:29 2015 UTC,He really turned up late this game. Almost bagged a third in there too!
tfc,334gpy,Makelevi,2,Sun Apr 19 14:11:19 2015 UTC,I'd rather him show up late than not show up at all like one of our previous DP's... I'm not saying names but at least he's not on a flight back to Eng.. I mean Italy right now.
tfc,334gpy,PistolsAndHearts,10,Sun Apr 19 14:41:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because Defoe didn't ever score 2 goals in one game or single handedly win us points with his clinical finishing at the start of the season..."
tfc,334gpy,errboi,-2,Sun Apr 19 15:58:23 2015 UTC,Ok sorry I'll correct myself. At least he hasn't jumped ship yet like a particularly spineless DP we had last year.
tfc,334gpy,PistolsAndHearts,2,Sun Apr 19 16:19:25 2015 UTC,"Again, though, Defoe hadn't jumped ship yet at this point."
tfc,334gpy,Makelevi,-3,Sun Apr 19 16:25:47 2015 UTC,Lmao you are taking a joke way too seriously... have a nice day bud.   Also if I recall correctly... He was injured at this point which pretty much ended any sort of productivity or passion from that tool. So yea I would say at this point is when he jumped ship.

tfc,334gpy,PistolsAndHearts,2,Sun Apr 19 17:00:45 2015 UTC,He still scored goals after our 5th game of the season.

tfc,334gpy,errboi,3,Sun Apr 19 17:18:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, he definitely became that. I don't like Defoe at all from his time here. But I don't understand people who think he had that attitude from the beginning - he didn't.  People act like there wasn't a period where this whole subreddit was super cocky about Defoe, especially after the season opener against Seattle when things looked really bright.

tfc,334gpy,Menessy27,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:40:13 2015 UTC,I know that but that's my whole point though. We can't depend on everyone being healthy all the time. It simply is not reality. When one of our starters gets injured our backline's quality decreases to an unacceptable level.   A backline isn't made up of only starters. It is made up of starters and the rest of the guys who are on standby when the inevitable injuries come in. Our starting line up is decent but we can't depend on them to be there all the time. We simply do not have the whole package figured out (and haven't for many years due to our constant habit of not spreading the $ across the field on all lines).
tfc,334gpy,loconet,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:48:35 2015 UTC,Are people still acting like we've had anything close to our starting lineup at the back this year?
tfc,336gkg,Coramoor_,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:08:56 2015 UTC,"I missed the first half cause I had the ""live feed"" thing playing from before the game started, so I think it was basically just a loop of two guys fumbling with the controls and doing random checks.    I had it open in another tab and was going to tab over just once they're done fixing their bullshit problems..  Being distracted with my other activities, eventually I did bother to check that tab to see why the hell the game hasn't started yet.  Turns out I'm an idiot.  Anyway, from what I saw in the second half, we played well.  Good away point."

tfc,333xa4,GuyWhoDrivesTheCart,8,Sun Apr 19 07:47:17 2015 UTC,"Not overreact.   I said it in the other thread (on my other account, logging into my phone) but the issues have been stacked against this team. Bad ref calls costing games. International duty pulling away stars. Injuries and cards crippling our already weak backline. Bye weeks stomping on momentum.  When I looked at the start of the season at our 7 game road trip, I predicted (optimistically) that we would head back to BMO with 10 points. I deemed that acceptable. Actually, I deemed that pretty damn good. Based on pre-season and team lineups / form, I expected Columbus, RSL and FC Dallas would all beat us. I thought we could take Chicago, so that loss was unfortunate, but the Columbus loss really could have been a win if not for that card. Vancouver I didn't know how that would go, so I figured a tie was reasonable. We've got two games left, Orlando and Philly, and both are winnable. TFC could return home after the 7-game roadtrip of death with 9 points. Would that be so unacceptable, especially considering the shit that they've dealt with?  Our backline is weak, and Vanney needs to fix it. He has made some errors, but I don't think he will make them twice. The team is still learning his style, which is notably different from how they played under Nelson. But his style is coming along. We have been managing possession, something we never did in previous campaigns. We are creating tons of chances. We are scoring goals. The issue is that our backline, which by the way consisted of two backups last night, is leaky. An injury-ridden backline with depth issues is leaky, are we surprised? Can we do better? Yes. Are there dumb mistakes? Yes. Should we be looking to fire another coach, or make massive player moves, as a knee-jerk reaction? Fuck no.  Finish the roadtrip and get the boys home. Play a few in front of friendly fans. Let our injured players come back and play with some consistency. Give Vanney more than a month and a half to fully implement his vision. Then figure out what changes we need to make.   A month and a half. I honestly can't believe people are calling for Vanney's head already. Honestly, Sir Alex Ferguson may be the greatest coach ever, and he had four years at Manchester United before he had fully implemented his vision, and it was only then that Manchester began winning things. If we don't give coaches more than a few months, even rookie coaches, we will never reach a point where we can see if their vision is working.  Morale of the story, chill out everyone! This stuff takes time!"
tfc,333xa4,EasterlyFan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 13:24:24 2015 UTC,I'd argue that Vanney has made the same mistake with the back line every game: trying to play a high line with the wrong personnel. And I'm not confident that he won't do it again.
tfc,333xa4,mdps,2,Sun Apr 19 13:29:44 2015 UTC,"Is it a matter of the guys being unable to play a high line, or an issue where they are still learning how to do it?  I'm not arguing one way or another, just mentioning it for discussion."
tfc,333xa4,EasterlyFan,5,Sun Apr 19 13:50:51 2015 UTC,"Nothing.  Doing nothing will let the team get maintain some consistency going forward.  Doing nothing is not just our only option (how many coaches can you fire?), but our best option."
tfc,333xa4,now_we_here,2,Sun Apr 19 11:46:51 2015 UTC,Playing a game at home should do it
tfc,333xa4,Giaccherinho,2,Sun Apr 19 10:56:34 2015 UTC,A lot to be said for nothing. But the lack of depth in the back is systematic. If I were Bez I would be looking for a trade. We're going to have to give up someone promising (again); Osorio? Lovitz? Moore?
tfc,333xa4,mdps,3,Sun Apr 19 13:28:06 2015 UTC,Lovitz or Moore please. Keep Osorio in Toronto.
tfc,333xa4,EasterlyFan,2,Sun Apr 19 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe trade Dike or Moore + allocation for a defender. Or for allocation for space to sign a defender. Maybe Lovitz as well. That's about it. The team in general has played well but the backup defenders have really let us down so clearly more depth is needed there especially with our two CBs being injury prone. There's nothing wrong with the team other than that though. Unlike last year this team is really effective in holding possession, controlling the game and creating chances. But it doesn't matter if the defense gifts them goals  Dike or Moore seems like the smartest choice considering Dike cant even make the bench and we have Hamilton as well who could play for the 1st team. Even Babouli if needed.  Osorio is one of the last players this team would trade (other than the very obvious ones) and rightfully so. Young, Canadian, good possession player, and he's one of the players the team normally markets."
tfc,333xa4,Menessy27,-3,Mon Apr 20 17:44:08 2015 UTC,move the team to Brampton.
tfc,3331zq,notdarren,11,Sun Apr 19 01:22:29 2015 UTC,"Something needs to change.  Coach, players, management - whatever.  Things clearly aren't working for the team and Bez has to start acting because we're not getting any better."
tfc,3331zq,LightsCameraRegret,5,Sun Apr 19 01:33:37 2015 UTC,There's so much wrong that it's hard to pinpoint what exactly is the cause.
tfc,3331zq,CompletelyUnbaised,14,Sun Apr 19 01:35:31 2015 UTC,"Unpopular Opinion of the Day: I'm not going to blame Vanney, not yet.  In the summer, how many of you whined that we fire every coach we have, and that we needed to stick with one person to see it through?  Our defence is absolute shit. We have no depth, we knew it in the summer and didn't do nearly enough to address it. Caldwell should've been let go. We knew he was going to spend half the year on the injury table, that's why he was stripped of his captaincy. Morgan isn't good enough to play in the MLS. Hagglund wasn't put into a position to succeed last year, and the same thing is happening again.  Bendik simply hasn't been good enough. I like the guy, I think he's decent when he's on his game, but he hasn't made enough saves this year to steal us a point. He needs to be held accountable too.  Giovinco is among the top paid players in the league, but he hasn't played like it yet. We can get more out of Altidore. Michael Bradley can give us more as well.  I put more blame on Bezbatchenko than I do on Vanney at this point in the season. Going after the coach is such a cop out, our shit players are playing like shit and that's why we don't win."
tfc,3331zq,R00K416,13,Sun Apr 19 02:27:33 2015 UTC,"The Hagglund/Morrow switch is as clear an indication as any that he has no idea what the fuck he's doing.  I get it, firing coaches sucks. SO STOP HIRING UNQUALIFIED COACH AFTER UNQUALIFIED COACH IN THE FIRST FUCKING PLACE. We could have had Kinnear. We could have had Petke. Instead Bez just ensured that when Vanney gets fired, he's gone too, and we have even less stability. Great work as always."
tfc,3331zq,OtterBurger,5,Sun Apr 19 03:41:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Yes we need stability, but stability after we hire someone who isn't a rookie manager looking to prove himself. We throw money around like confetti, blow just a little of that over to the hiring of a solid manager amd see what happens?  If Canada can find a Benito Floro, TFC can find a true manager"
tfc,3331zq,KSenCSmith,2,Sun Apr 19 05:15:54 2015 UTC,I disagree on Morgan. He's been much improved and showed quality ad effort against both Chicago and Dallas. Still has a lot to improve on.
tfc,3331zq,mdps,2,Sun Apr 19 13:17:01 2015 UTC,"How about thinking about it this way, if LA or any other team with a history of success lose their head coach to retirement, would they ever consider hiring Vanney?"

tfc,3331zq,TorontoFC15,9,Sun Apr 19 01:37:20 2015 UTC,"Signed.  His mistakes are ridiculous and he never learns. Plays a high line against Vancouver and gets murdered in the first half. If Manneh didn't lay an egg that day we'd have 0 points.  Plays a high line again against Chicago, Accam and Amerikwa torture us on the counter.  Stuck with Creavalle for 4 games when he was god awful and Jackson was miles better off the bench twice in a row.  Moves Morrow out of his comfort zone and into CB (Nelsen did this last year - it failed). It didn't work against Chicago, and he does it again now against Dallas. Plays Hagglund in an uncomfortable position at RB against one of the quickest and most dangerous left sided players in the league, who promptly burns him twice.  He is wasting the talent on this roster. There is no way we should miss the playoffs with the players we have. He simply has no idea what he's doing, at all.  For god's sake can we just once cut our losses early and make a change before the season is lost? We still have a chance to make something of this, but not if we keep this clown on. Vanney out."
tfc,3331zq,-notthesun-,2,Sun Apr 19 01:41:19 2015 UTC,"He adjusted and we won that game. Manneh didn't ""lay an egg"". He's a fast player who's also a poor finisher. So were all the teams we played last season just lucky not to lose to us because Oduro ""laid an egg""? No, that's what those type of player do. Nobody can keep up with them on the counter, but normally they don't finish. We didn't play a high line against Chicago. Watch the game. Jackson played right back last season and was atrocious. if you're really saying starting an attacking player at right back would improve our defense then you don't have a clue what you're talking about. Right back is not an ""uncomfortable"" position for Hagglund. He did well there last season. On the other hand, Hagglund was awful at centerback vs Chicago, while Morrow was good, so it makes a lot more sense to play Morrow at CB where he was good, Morgan at LB where he was good, and Hagglund at RB where he was good last season rather than put Hagglund at CB where he was garbage the week before and remove a left back who was playing well in Morgan so that you can put a fucking winger who can't defend against one of the most dangerous players in the league in Castillo.   Sorry but anyone who is saying fire Vanney is a complete and utter moron. It is not Vanney's fault we have had to play 5 matches in a row on the road. It is not Vanney's fault that two players have been sent off in five matches. It is not Vanney's fault that he has to play below-par backup defenders every single game because the starters are injured. It's not Vanney's fault that the referee wrongly sent off Morrow, or wrongly disallowed Hagglund's goal, or wrongly allows RSL's clearly offside goal. If he didn't that's 1-2 losses off our record. It's not Vanney's fault that Hagglund leaves all the space in the world for Dallas to play easy balls into Castillo. What, you think Vanney tells him to do that? laughable. It's not Vanney's fault that Warner runs into Perquis causing him to lose the ball and gifts a goal to Dallas. It's not Vanney's fault that Bendik has let in 4 weak goals in the last 2 games. Get a fucking clue.  People like you are why TFC has become a mockery. Ya let's fire our coach yet again, this time 5 games into the season when the coach has had to work with loads of injuries, bad refereeing and players playing below par. Great idea."

We didn't play a high line against Chicago. Watch the game.   We did early, and Chicago got a bunch of counter attacks on us.

Jackson has been better at RB in the limited minutes he's had there so far compared to Creavalle. That's my reasoning. I would start Delgado or Morrow there as well first before moving Hagglund there. He is not and never will be a good RB, it's not his game.  He put Hagglund in against Castillo and he got roasted twice in 10 minutes. At least Jackson has some speed and agility to deal with him, or if you prefer he should have started Morrow at RB and left Hagglund at CB (Morrow was garbage at CB against Chicago btw). He left a young player out to dry plain and simple, one of the worst roster decisions I have ever seen, beating out Nelsen playing Justin Braun at RM for a game last year. Vanney is directly responsible for Dallas' first two goals against us. Hagglund did poorly but I don't blame him because what the fuck do you expect him to do in that position against that kind of player. Absolute lunacy. Vanney is 100% to blame.   People like you are why TFC has become a mockery. Ya let's fire our coach yet again, this time 5 games into the season when the coach has had to work with loads of injuries, bad refereeing and players playing below par. Great idea.   No, TFC has done that all on their own. How many fucking rookie coaches do we have to endure before someone says enough is enough? It's fucking ridiculous the money we've invested in the team without getting a real manager. The problem with TFC is not that we keep firing people, it's that we keep hiring the wrong guys."
tfc,3331zq,-notthesun-,7,Mon Apr 20 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"Firing Vanney may need to happen, but Jesus, not give games in.   We have a shitty road trip. I would have predicted 10 points from this road trip to start the season, and we can still salvage nine. We had two games that got screwed because of bad calls. We haven't had our starting backline outside of Vancouver I don't think.   Vanney isn't great but the real issue is a complete lack of consistency in the lineup so far, as well as no defensive depth. We knew that last summer. We honestly need to beef up our defense this summer.   I dunno, I don't see how a new coach coming in is a benefit. I don't see how blowing up 5 games in is good for morale or the team. Vanney talks like someone who knows his shit. If I could go back in time I would never want him hired, but Toronto fans (of all teams) are so quick to call for immediate, major changes as soon as things go wrong that a reputation as developed. Give it ten games at least. 3 points should be achievable in the next two road games, and a record of 3 and 4 in the first seven is salvageable.   Don't blow it up until their is a crisis. There isn't yet. We are getting there though, I'll give it that."
tfc,3331zq,StJohnsFog,9,Sun Apr 19 06:08:22 2015 UTC,"Hell, a lot of people (myself included) felt 6 points out of our road trip would be the low end of acceptable results. Even just 1 win in our next 2 games would be fine. 9 points from a rough road trip with depth crippling injuries? That would be magical. The TFC fanbase might be the most impatient fanbase in the world. We could honestly hire Sir Alexander Ferguson and someone here would want him fired by the end of his first month."

For two seasons. The only reason we're stuck with this guy is that we blasted through coaches so fast that we hit the bottom of the barrel and nobody in their right mind would want to work as a coach for TFC"

They did it when they kept Nelson on after signing Defoe and Bradley, and then they did it again.  Vanney's record since he came in is 3-10-2 (i think).

The main problem is really that the MLS schedule doesn't sync with FIFA's international game schedule, like European leagues do.  We WANT players on our team to represent their countries in competitions."
tfc,32gk9a,warpus,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:27:51 2015 UTC,I doubt you'll find anyone as good as Bradley in a European 2nd division   I'd say Luongo on Swindon Town (League one) isn't far off.  5 years younger and he just won player of the tournament in the Asia cup for Australia.

tfc,32gk9a,warpus,9,Mon Apr 13 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"Because we want world class players, and world class players generally end up representing their country.

They are too stubborn. It's a huge issue, but they don't seem to care. The European leagues schedule off weeks for International periods. The MLS just keeps playing. It's stupid. They don't even have to move the season to align with Europen, just schedule off weeks, but they don't. Too stubborn."
tfc,32gk9a,warpus,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:55:47 2015 UTC,"They don't seem to care, but I think that's mainly because it doesn't affect the teams in the league by a large enough margin..  yet.  Eventually they're going to have to accommodate this.   I'm not sure when, but one day the balance is going to flip from ""We don't have to really do anything about this quite yet"" to..  ""Aw crap, we better do something about it"""
tfc,32gk9a,warpus,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:17:39 2015 UTC,"Because we want world class players, and world class players generally end up representing their country.   This is not necessarily true because of the difference in quality between countries. Look at all the German talent in the bundesliga that is million times better than any talent in the USMNT that are not in the German national team.   The bar is so much higher in Europe that you can not represent your national team and still be much better than any American/Canadian talent."
tfc,32gk9a,quelar,2,Mon Apr 13 18:24:56 2015 UTC,"Good points there, but we're striving to be a ""world class"" club.  That means that we're going to end up with players representing their countries playing for us.  The better we are - the more of those players we're likely to end up with.  That isn't a problem in itself - what's a problem is when MLS league games are scheduled during international breaks.  Once this becomes a bigger problem for the league (meaning when more players leave during such breaks), we'll probably see the league take a different stance on scheduling league games during international breaks.  I think, anyway.  I don't see why they wouldn't.  For now we gotta put up with it and sign players no matter where their national allegiances may lie."
tfc,32gk9a,BlueBlurDown,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:06:58 2015 UTC,"Look at all the German talent in the bundesliga that is million times better than any talent in the USMNT that are not in the German national team.   I think your understanding of how much better they are is off by a margin of many magnitudes.  The US isn't a bad team dominated by European giants, they're a good team, with some great players who are catching up very rapidly.   The point that you seem to be making is that we don't want great US players, we want ok European ones.  I think you would see very quickly that the quality on the pitch would go down if we did this."
tfc,32gk9a,Menessy27,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:49:29 2015 UTC,"The bar is so much higher in Europe that you can not represent your national team and still be much better than any American/Canadian talent.   You severely underestimate the American squad. The Canadian squad isn't there yet, but the American squad is no slouch. Bradley, for example, was playing for AS Roma and could easily be still playing in the top European leagues. AS Roma wanted to keep him, but TFC's offer was too good for him to pass up.    You aren't going to find many players in the Bundesliga that are not in the German national team that are better players than Bradley, Altidore, Dempsey, etc."
tfc,32gk9a,errboi,7,Tue Apr 14 12:54:30 2015 UTC,So we should focus on bringing in players  that arent good enough to ever play for their national teams as DPs? sounds like an awful idea.
tfc,32gk9a,danoo,2,Mon Apr 13 23:42:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a very shortsighted approach to building a squad."
tfc,32gk9a,drretro,8,Tue Apr 14 04:57:45 2015 UTC,"How about if we just kept it to non-high price players we've already had. I'd say we'd not be worse off if we somehow managed to keep Laba, Silva, Plata and Gilberto instead."
tfc,32gk9a,Swervitu,2,Mon Apr 13 18:20:52 2015 UTC,Laba and Gilberto are great examples of quality players on a budget.
tfc,32gk9a,EasterlyFan,2,Tue Apr 14 11:14:29 2015 UTC,"id honestly rather have Laba & Gilberto than Bradley and Jozy aslong as we have giovinco. Man imagine Kaka, Gilberto & Giovinco..this team would be crazy good... to be honest Bradley is not that good as an attacking mid and jozy isnt that good of a striker and giovinco is a really good striker but needs to get the ball in position. Honestly this team would be good if we trade Osorio and get someone who can hold the ball and not lose it"
tfc,32gk9a,sfw84,3,Tue Apr 14 09:51:56 2015 UTC,"The issue is scheduling, not that we have players that represent the USA. MLS doesn't recognize FIFA dates, and so the guys have to miss club games to play International games. This doesn't happen in Europe.  In the short-term, if your argument is that we should avoid internationals until MLS begins to recognize FIFA dates, I think that is pretty short-sighted for growth of the club. We WANT players who are of a high enough calibre to play for nations making the World Cup, USA included. Does it suck when we lose them? Yes. Is it great to have our players playing on the international stage, and garnering the attention of people who otherwise wouldn't see them? Absolutely."
tfc,32cahe,EasterlyFan,9,Sun Apr 12 15:55:01 2015 UTC,"I think Bradley is right. The start to the season for the boys has been very odd, outside of the game in Vancouver most of the games have either been missing key players or have transpired in very odd ways (unfortunate red cards). Bye weeks have been tossed in frequently as well.  We have a huge stretch starting next week, and there should hopefully be some lineup consistency. Despite some heartbreakers early, I've been trying to convince myself to hold-off on judgement until middle / end of May. I'm excited for the consistency."
tfc,32cahe,mdps,4,Sun Apr 12 15:57:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There have also been positive points. We've scored 6 away goals; 4 new players have scored, including the 2 new DPs; we beat the top team in the league; and all our losses (including the referee-assisted ones) have been to teams in the top half of their conference."

tfc,328bzz,PistolsAndHearts,1 point,Sun Apr 12 01:42:30 2015 UTC,I understand that but why not have a bye week scheduled for the weekend that the players had international duties? They had plenty of time.   Disclaimer   none of this has anything to do with TFC's poor performance on the field.   That's a completely different story.
tfc,328bzz,quelar,3,Sun Apr 12 01:58:04 2015 UTC,"If Toronto was given bye weeks the weeks they had international duties that would have been in our favour against all other teams. They all had to play, we were worse off because we have bigger star players than most coupled with injuries and suspensions.  You are making something out of nothing here."
tfc,328bzz,errboi,3,Sun Apr 12 02:02:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we've played some of the best soccer in the history of the franchise this year. It's just not been sustainable and it's been marred by injuries to the back line. I think with our starting back line healthy we see a lot more soccer like we saw in the second half against Vancouver. At least that's my take on it."
tfc,328bzz,PistolsAndHearts,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:16:10 2015 UTC,"It's just not been sustainable and it's been marred by injuries to the back line.   This I 100% agree with.

tfc,328bzz,errboi,2,Sun Apr 12 05:36:01 2015 UTC,"Which elbow to the head are you referring to? I'd say we were deserving of the supplementary punishment. It was a reckless and dangerous tackle made out of frustration. As for Gantar's colleague being on the panel: I'm pretty sure its standard practice to have a PRO rep on the DisCo panel, so there's not really any conspiracy to fuck TFC over there."
tfc,328bzz,PistolsAndHearts,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:21:21 2015 UTC,"I'd say we were deserving of the supplementary punishment. It was a reckless and dangerous tackle made out of frustration.   I agree, and that makes it seem like they care about player safety. So why would they skip supplementary discipline on an even more dangerous play?  It was Findley who was the recipient of the elbow... The offender was Adailton which if memory serves correctly was on a yellow at the time."
tfc,328bzz,errboi,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:47:21 2015 UTC,"I guess it was just an oversight. I honestly don't remember that happening, but I might have just been in the bathroom or something when it happened. Do you remember what minute it was in?"

tfc,3225ly,mafiazul,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:28:04 2015 UTC,I think that's the official away supporter stand. You don't really see concentrations of away fans elsewhere.
tfc,3225ly,TruckLife,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:09:08 2015 UTC,"The best way to get to the stadium is by bicycle. Unfortunately, Bike Share Toronto doesn't have any stations near the stadium. So this probably isn't a good solution for you.  Your next best bet is to take the 504 King Street streetcar west from the core into Liberty Village. Debark at Joe Shuster Way. But come out early and visit a pub for a pre-game beer to avoid the crush. Then follow the crowd under the train tracks to the stadium.  The 511 Bathurst and 509 Harbourfront streetcars both drop off very close to the stadium. But you have to board at Bathurst station (not near the core) or Union station. It will be impossible to get on anywhere else along the route (unless you come well before the game)."

I always said I'd root for them right up to the final, because I want TFC to win the first MLS Champion's League title. Honestly though, I want an MLS team to win. And if it can't be TFC, I want it to be another Canadian team.   Looks like prize money for winning will be over $5 million too (when you factor in guaranteed Club World Cup money) so that could end up invested din developing Canadian players, or bringing in a big name that will make more Canadian fans.   Ultimately, a win is big for Canada, and I'm a fan of growing this sport across the country. I hope they do it."

tfc,31xsrd,MasochisticLeafsFan,2,Fri Apr 10 20:52:08 2015 UTC,But it is a Canadian team on the world stage. Still counts in my book
tfc,31xsrd,KSenCSmith,0,Fri Apr 10 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"Country > club means, say, you'd care more about the American national team than your MLS team, or you'd put aside your differences in Spain and cheer for the national team rather than Madrid/Barca. It doesn't mean Madrid will cheer for Barca in a UEFA final because ""country > club"". It doesn't make any sense."
tfc,31xsrd,MasochisticLeafsFan,2,Fri Apr 10 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"Europe is a bit different. If the teams from your country do not perform well the league can actually risk losing a champions league spot. On the contrary if the teams are performing exceptionally well for a period of time they can actually gain a champions league spot. Additionally, the place where you want your rivals to rot is within your own league, not on the continental stage because then it just makes a fool of the league, your team included.  Barca/Madrid might be another story given it will take something special to prevent the other from qualifying for continental play but in general no matter how bad the rivalry it is, if the match is a continental fixture you would put the league before the rivalry."
tfc,31xsrd,onthelongrun,3,Sun Apr 12 03:16:23 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty subjective discussion. To me, a Canadian team deserves my support when on the world stage and not playing against TFC.

tfc,31xsrd,KSenCSmith,-1,Fri Apr 10 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"Yup. Sports mean a whole lot less when you want you're biggest rivals to win the biggest prizes, and it's absolutely why Vancouver can have a sold out, intimidation madhouse while we sit in a half empty stadium being okay with our rivals winning because they're Canadian."
tfc,31xsrd,MasochisticLeafsFan,2,Fri Apr 10 21:05:47 2015 UTC,"On an international level, USA/Mexico is a MASSIVE rivalry in Soccer, FAR BIGGER than anything TFC/Impact have developed over the years. I'ld rather see the CCL won by an MLS team than a Mexican team   Sadly we do not have major rivals but given how our national team has played and what they have endured in CONCACAF I sure as fuck would rather see our league rivals actually beat the product of our international competition's leagues."

tfc,31xsrd,NortonFord,4,Sun Apr 12 19:27:35 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  To be honest, TFC has had so little success that I've generally been able to cheer for the Impact and Whitecaps as secondary teams.  It will likely change if TFC meets a Canadian team in the playoffs or if TFC and the Impact have a serious battle for a playoff spot.  But so far it hasn't been hard to always be pro-Canada."

tfc,31vk9l,TacoDirtyToMe,2,Thu Apr 9 17:48:05 2015 UTC,"The VIP section was only good during the world cup. I've been there for regular games and its nothing special, its just a big room with a bar.  I've also been in the owner's box and it was nothing special. I did learn how easy it was to use their bathrooms and have used them every since though."

tfc,31vk9l,mdps,4,Thu Apr 9 19:15:33 2015 UTC,"This is the same thing every year and I am always the unpopular opinion on this. I don't really mind. No one really plays a full 90 minutes.  You get to see a bunch of kids play.   Hamilton scored in the spurs one I think.  They would normally be training anyway. So why not let them play a game against people. I've yet to see an injury in one of these.     Don't considerate a game, think of it as another training day. Or be mad and don't go."
tfc,31vk9l,notdarren,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought I would be holding the minority opinion. I'm not so worried about fatigue or injuries, but by it being a distraction for the team. They have an MLS game to prepare for that week. A day lost to line pockets."
tfc,31vk9l,lucastimmons,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:05:45 2015 UTC,"I was just judging by the comments all being against it.   I don't think they're going to work on tactics to beat man city.  So they can still work on training for the following game.   It'll still be more if a practice than a game. Yes it could distract them from their game the following Saturday, but I doubt it'll any noticeable harm."
tfc,31vk9l,RadagastWiz,6,Wed Apr 8 20:52:47 2015 UTC,Ugh. Seeing us potentially losing 3 times in 7 calendar days isn't going to make for a happy week. But who knows? Maybe we'll win.
tfc,31vk9l,joshuawakefield,3,Wed Apr 8 14:48:35 2015 UTC,Need to straighten ourselves out. Portland and San Jose should be beatable if we manage to overcome defensive issues.

tfc,31vk9l,2daMooon,2,Wed Apr 8 16:29:54 2015 UTC,They still awkwardly display Spurs ads on the TVs in the Air Canada Centre concourse.  Seems like the contract to promote the team is longer than Defoe's actual stay here.
tfc,31vk9l,2daMooon,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"Because they made a deal to sell merchandise and promote the team over in Toronto as a way to get more fans overseas. They sort of stuck it in with the Defoe deal, perfect excuse I guess."

tfc,31w1mt,quelar,3,Wed Apr 8 17:28:21 2015 UTC,There was a pre-sale today for TFC Insider members. But every single match wouldn't even load on ticketmaster.

tfc,31vfkg,fuzz_boy,2,Wed Apr 8 13:49:34 2015 UTC,"He's been on point this season. Just the one bad goal from Chicago, but that was more our backline to blame for screening him."
tfc,31vfkg,jojomchobo,2,Wed Apr 8 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree somewhat. I think he needs to do a better job of coming off his line to claim crosses. Probably could have picked up a couple more road points if he wasn't constantly rooted to his line. I think he's a solid keeper, but he's not in the best form at the moment."
tfc,31vfkg,errboi,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:02:03 2015 UTC,That is true. I think we've let in the most goals from crosses/corners in MLS.
tfc,31vfkg,jojomchobo,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:02:31 2015 UTC,Commanding the back line is his job. That was all on him.

tfc,31vfkg,R00K416,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:08:01 2015 UTC,seems to me he got lucky on the third shot.
tfc,31vfkg,moosemanca,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:23:13 2015 UTC,Doesn't really matter since everything after the first shot was offside anyway. Other angles show that the linesman's flag went up on the second shot.
tfc,31vfkg,errboi,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:59:54 2015 UTC,Terrible game for him in Chicago.. otherwise he's been alright.  Our defensive play on the whole needs improvement.  We get scattered and nervous rather than just playing with confidence in our ability.
tfc,31vfkg,barticusz,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:27:15 2015 UTC,"All those saves were mainly from good positioning and decision making including the outfield player, but he also made a very nice reactionary stretch so I'm going to vote for him."

tfc,31r7z5,Coramoor_,2,Tue Apr 7 16:45:19 2015 UTC,Yeah in the 2 (3 maybe?) games I've gotten to watch Bono has not impressed. Not at all. I'd love for Q to get a chance to reclaim the starting spot that he excelled in last year with Wilmington.
tfc,31r7z5,errboi,3,Tue Apr 7 17:03:44 2015 UTC,The fact that Roberts isn't starting is laughable...
tfc,31r7z5,Soldado4lyf,3,Tue Apr 7 21:02:41 2015 UTC,"Well Bono was supposed to be ""MLS ready"" coming out of the draft. It made sense to blood him a bit in USL before bringing him up to the first team as a back up. Now I'm wondering what scout was responsible for that ""MLS ready"" tag and why all our ""MLS ready"" draftees are never ready for MLS."
tfc,31r7z5,errboi,2,Tue Apr 7 21:20:50 2015 UTC,whichever scout said that either saw him on his best game or they shouldn't be scouting soccer. He hasn't read a single cross or corner kick well that I've seen

tfc,31r7z5,OtterBurger,2,Thu Apr 9 01:25:15 2015 UTC,"Babouli is exactly why you need a USL team, in any other situation he'd have been abandoned Emery Welshman style, now he's got a very good shot of impressing and moving up to better things"

tfc,31ozwb,Coramoor_,2,Tue Apr 7 00:46:08 2015 UTC,Did great in defense with the last second block and was working into the attack which eventually found a goal.  Too bad 3 goals went in.
tfc,31ozwb,Deegs80,2,Tue Apr 7 00:57:15 2015 UTC,I figured Giovinco would make the team. He had that goal and the nice pass for Cheyrou's goal.

tfc,31mpg8,warpus,10,Mon Apr 6 14:31:11 2015 UTC,No. No no no. We're not going to hire a quality replacement at this point in time so there's no point in blowing it all up again right now. Just no.
tfc,31mpg8,errboi,4,Mon Apr 6 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think he should be the coach, but I agree, it would be opening the door to a classic TFC crapfest if we can him now, or during this season.    Maybe we can bring in some one to ""assist"" him and suggest more timely subs and other stuff, but we can't fire him."
tfc,31mpg8,fuzz_boy,2,Mon Apr 6 16:58:54 2015 UTC,"Well we've already done that with Robin Fraser, haven't we?"
tfc,31mpg8,errboi,3,Mon Apr 6 19:25:04 2015 UTC,can we have one fucking season where we don't fire someone? is that too much to fucking ask?
tfc,31mpg8,sfw84,3,Mon Apr 6 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"no, stop being a baby, injuries have been a major problem and it's 4 games into the season, all of which have been on the road. RSL should've been a draw. 4 points in 4 is not bad. I know we're at 3, I'm counting the bad reffing"
tfc,31mpg8,Coramoor_,5,Tue Apr 7 00:43:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think Vanney should have been appointed head coach. That said, what's the guy to do? He's playing the best team he can given the roster, injuries, and international dates. The style of play is good. He's been raped by officials twice. If he had one point each from the last three games (all of which were well in hand), we'd be on 6 points, in 4th place in the east and feeling pretty good. That we're on 3 points is not on Vanney."
tfc,31mpg8,mdps,2,Mon Apr 6 16:39:59 2015 UTC,No.
tfc,31mpg8,Ontarien,2,Mon Apr 6 17:38:51 2015 UTC,Probably not a good idea at this point although I agree that we need a good coach with experience. Hopefully he's not here for the long run but I'd let him stay for the season.
tfc,31mpg8,Bdog5,2,Mon Apr 6 18:35:01 2015 UTC,Yes. Get a manager. Not a coach. A manager with experience. Not just MLS experience but experience in general. I'd throw so much money at Brian McDermott. I honestly think Toronto would be a club he could identify with and become loyal to.
tfc,31mpg8,gregandrews,2,Mon Apr 6 19:05:55 2015 UTC,"I'm usually quite vocal on being 100% against rookie coaches, and I was really skeptical with Vanney coming in, but now is not the time. If it were to happen it should have been before the start of this season. It's rarely good to change coaches in the game mid-season anyways. It's amazing how the FO will throw millions at top level players and not bring in sufficient staff to manage the team."
tfc,31mpg8,TorontoFC15,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:54:22 2015 UTC,Lets get Bob Bradley
tfc,31mpg8,tfcfreak23,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"No. Absolutely not. Jesus christ.  As mentioned, Vanney is not the reason we have lost the past three games. We had two stupid calls from refs. In this last game, we had some players not play their best. Is he doing some things wrong? Sure, and that's to be expected with a rookie coach. But when he talks, it is clear he is far more competent than Nelsen. His tactics are by and large working. TFC is dangerous on the attack. Last game, where our defence sucked, we were missing almost our entire starting backline. Of course our defence was mediocre.  Seriously, the guy has had what? Ten games? Half of which were on the tail end of a declining season. How can someone even want to blow up the current situation four games into the season? Toronto sports fans are known out east to be irrational and call for change based on emotion, but come on, even this seems a bit far.  Also, who is the replacement?"
tfc,31mjo6,fuzz_boy,3,Mon Apr 6 13:34:53 2015 UTC,This is a surprisingly honest account to see on the TFC website. I wouldn't have expected such candor.

tfc,31nbex,hbell,2,Mon Apr 6 18:31:29 2015 UTC,carver left because the refs were shit

tfc,31mgsj,logan1111,19,Mon Apr 6 13:06:06 2015 UTC,For who?  He's not the reason we're losing games.  We're tactically shit.  Our defense blows and our midfield spends more time passing the ball backwards than forwards.  The amount of times we kill momentum to pass the ball back to Bendik only to have him boot it up the field is ridiculous. I swear that every time Bradley gets the ball he is facing our own net.  The only truly terrible thing about Bendik is his ball distribution.
tfc,31mgsj,LightsCameraRegret,2,Mon Apr 6 13:21:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed, why does this have any upvotes at all.  Bendik is absolutely not the problem."
tfc,31mgsj,peetss,7,Mon Apr 6 14:11:39 2015 UTC,"It's still a question, you should never downvote harmless discussion."
tfc,31mgsj,LightsCameraRegret,-1,Mon Apr 6 17:09:09 2015 UTC,"No doubt Bradley has been hot garbage this year. He is literally a non-factor. Cheyrou looks to be 10x better. But that's another story. Bendik made so many mistakes last season that cost games. The defense is also to blame. But, Bendik deserves a lot of blame also. I know his scapegoat is that the defense is soooooo terrible that we are lucky that he saves anything. Right now I don't know who they should bring in. They should've done that in the offseason, but at this point there is not a lot worse the GK can do."
tfc,31mgsj,denMAR,5,Mon Apr 6 13:32:20 2015 UTC,I don't think Bendik is the problem. We've been talking about it for years now - solidifying that back four is key.
tfc,31mgsj,Bdog5,5,Mon Apr 6 15:48:14 2015 UTC,Hell no. Our (often injured) defence are what leads to a lot of scoring chances. He's actually keeping us in a lot of the games recently.
tfc,31mgsj,Coramoor_,2,Mon Apr 6 18:40:38 2015 UTC,"here's my rule, if you want to post about getting rid of someone, suggest a viable alternative.  He had a poor game against Chicago, it happens. RSL wasn't his fault, nor was Columbus. He kept TFC in both Columbus and Vancouver.  He's easily a top 10 goalkeeper in the league, which should be more than good enough."
tfc,31mgsj,Johnny1337,-3,Mon Apr 6 20:48:26 2015 UTC,I have to say it's his time to leave as well. I do agree he makes a lot of saves and our defense leaves him out to dry on a lot of occasions. But its the routine saves that he misses which has cost us to many games. As much as he is a good guy on and off the field they need a change in net.
tfc,31mgsj,errboi,0,Mon Apr 6 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly: he misses routine saves. Also, I would say his save count is about average."
tfc,31mgsj,errboi,-2,Mon Apr 6 14:15:20 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people on here are going to say that TFC has no defense, and that is the reason why other teams are scoring at will. Even more will protest that Bendik is the best GK in MLS, but its the team around him is the reason for any negatives associated with his name. However, I believe that is not the case. I think he is a mediocre MLS GK at best. He is decent at getting off of the ground quickly, but other than that his game is average. Last game really showed how bad of a GK he really is. In the offseason I thought he should've been out of there along with Vanney, but they decided to stick with him. I gave him a chance this season, but now I think it's time for him to go. Try the backup, or bring in someone else. Idk Julio Cesar maybe? Lol I'm joking about that, I know someone on here would think that I am serious. But really Bendik has to go!!!"
tfc,31mgsj,errboi,5,Mon Apr 6 13:12:11 2015 UTC,"So he's above average at getting off the ground quickly, and he's average at everything else? By definition that would make him better than your average MLS goalkeeper and worth keeping around."
tfc,31it2v,TorontoFC15,5,Sun Apr 5 14:34:27 2015 UTC,"We lost against Chicago.  We have Bradley, Giovinco and Altidore...  Unbelievable."
tfc,31it2v,peetss,4,Sun Apr 5 21:33:24 2015 UTC,A good offense doesn't make a good defense.
tfc,31it2v,kimilu,2,Sun Apr 5 22:07:01 2015 UTC,I think our weak defensive line is really starting to show. It's not that the goals we're getting aren't well set up. It's just that we can't hold on to them for more then 10 minutes.
tfc,31it2v,McWigan,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:44:18 2015 UTC,"I think I'm in agreeance with most, new defence is weak... But also the GK imo... First goal looked like a pretty standard stop... Other two not so much, but ever since I started watching I haven't had much confidence in the guy...  Am I wrong?"
tfc,31it2v,errboi,2,Mon Apr 6 04:30:15 2015 UTC,"Bendik has been in a bit of a slump to start the season IMO. He's typically been an excellent shot stopper with decent positioning and great reflexes, who's main detraction is his poor distribution on long kicks. This season he's been shown to have little to no command of his box, which has hurt us more than usual with our depleted back line. If you get Caldwell and Perquis fit again we'll start winning some of those headers in the box and Bendik won't look so poor. At least that's my take on it. Right now we don't know how to defend against a decent crossing team, which coincides with one of Bendik's weaker areas."
tfc,31it2v,McWigan,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:09:07 2015 UTC,"Fair enough! I just feel it's tough to tell if a defence is as bad as it is if the keeper (as you say) is losing control of his own box. They have to be able to trust him, and he has to trust them... Tough call really!"

tfc,31gbpc,TorontoFC15,1 point,Sun Apr 5 07:29:12 2015 UTC,"Nice pass by Cheyrou from midfield and good of Morgan to find space on the left, but that finish by Giovinco, and the confused keeper made that a dud for the highlights. Expect Giovinco will show a lot more quality goaks thus season."
tfc,31gbpc,HammerOfGods,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:07:28 2015 UTC,This got all kinds of foaming praise on Twitter and I don't see why. Is it a goal? Sure. But it hit the keeper and deflected in when it could have just as easily deflected out. A nice try but not a decisive goal. A fluke at best.
tfc,31gepr,LightsCameraRegret,12,Sat Apr 4 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"We play with no ambition. There were so many times today when Bradley/Giovinco had the ball and the rest of the guys were standing there and not moving into open position at all. The third goal was a bit his fault, but Bendik played really well today. Morgan impressed me as well today. Hopefully Vanney finds a way to motivate our guys because I can see him getting fired if we keep playing like this."
tfc,31gepr,currystain37,6,Sat Apr 4 21:07:34 2015 UTC,I think TFC attacked quite well but still look very shaky on defense. If Creavalle hadn't got sent off I think TFC could have at least got a draw. Hopefully the back line comes back from injury soon.
tfc,31gepr,AllonsYe2,5,Sat Apr 4 21:10:14 2015 UTC,"He should have been subbed off at half. His tackling was so poor all game, don't know why Vanney let him keep playing"
tfc,31gepr,spursfan101,4,Sat Apr 4 21:16:33 2015 UTC,"He's still quite young so I think in a couple years Creavalle could become a good defender. But at the moment he isn't good enough. The first goal came on his side due to poor defending and he couldn't handle Chicago's attackers all match. The only reason he's getting any game time is because Bloom is out, and Jackson is probably even worse at right back."
tfc,31gepr,AllonsYe2,2,Sat Apr 4 21:33:09 2015 UTC,"Although I agree with you, I was hoping that this year (especially with TFC II) was the year that we would have a team of MLS-ready players. Or at least MLS-ready starters."
tfc,31gepr,mdps,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:11:23 2015 UTC,"I think TFC II will help with that problem in the future and add some much needed depth to the team, but that will take time. Hopefully TFC II will give game time to players and increase the overall quality of the players but not right now. It's too early to be seeing the effects, in a couple seasons though I think it will show."
tfc,31gepr,AllonsYe2,3,Sun Apr 5 06:11:42 2015 UTC,Why? Because there is no one better who is fit. Unfortunately.
tfc,31gepr,mdps,2,Sun Apr 5 00:49:55 2015 UTC,i agree that there might not be anyone better. But he was getting beat all game long and was always looking likely for that red.

tfc,31gepr,OtterBurger,11,Sat Apr 4 21:07:26 2015 UTC,We keep splashing cash on players and hiring amateurs to manage them. It's insane.
tfc,31gepr,jztrumpeter,8,Sat Apr 4 23:58:51 2015 UTC,"He should have just never been hired. We should have stuck with Nelsen until the end of the season and looked for a real experienced coach in the off season.  Now we're stuck with Vanney, because the last thing we need is another coaching change."
tfc,31gepr,nourez,4,Sun Apr 5 02:37:35 2015 UTC,"8 goals in 4 games is really bad.  Keeping Creavalle on an entire game with a yellow card is also a bad idea, he kept getting beat and a red was bound to happen."

tfc,31gepr,mdps,8,Mon Apr 6 20:06:23 2015 UTC,"We held 60% possession and didn't get enough shots, and sure there were gaffes by certain players today. Get real with hitting the panic button 4 games in. It takes time to develop relationships, understand player behaviours ontop of fully understanding the tactics. If your outlook on life is toss away and push away everything that goes bad without going back and using it As a teaching tool to improve on unity and the team , then stop watching. Our defense is duck taped together and the coaches are trying to show players positional roles and movement to players who are playing in a foreign position to begin with. The key things here to take away? We can hold the ball, giovinco creates magic when he's on the ball, and we are weak on defense. From what has been said, morrow was only natural fb which is massive on a 4-3-3, both cbs weren't seasoned, and Bradley has to sit deeper and give up the duel pivot he was rocking with Cheyrou durin van game in favour of supporting the d line. When Caldwell is back, perquis is stable and bloom is up to speed and we can rotate a full defense, we will see results. Cut out the get rid of the coach bullshit already.   Edit: mb on forgetting Morgan, guy has been playing nicely the past 2 games."
tfc,31gepr,errboi,3,Sat Apr 4 23:13:16 2015 UTC,"RE: duck taped defence. TFC went into this season relying on a 34-year old who missed 11 games to injury last year. Adding Perquis was a good move, but they never had a real plan for depth at the position. Their subs are two sophomores and a rookie. After that they're playing people out of position."
tfc,31gepr,spursfan101,2,Sun Apr 5 01:04:29 2015 UTC,I don't think even the most pessimistic fans expected 3 defensive starters (Because really Bloom should be starting ahead of Creavalle) and a depth defender to be injured at the same time. Even the most well built MLS squad is going to struggle under those circumstances. We should probably have adjusted our tactics a little more to deal with the injuries than we did though. Something simple like only having 1 fullback get forward at a time would have likely helped out defensively without sacrificing too much attacking threat. At least that's my take on it.
tfc,31gepr,errboi,3,Mon Apr 6 20:11:42 2015 UTC,"He shouldn't have been hired in the first place though. We have spent lots of money on players, when the biggest issue as always been coaching. Spend some money and get a proper manager for these players."
tfc,31gepr,neuron_fc,6,Sun Apr 5 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"Perquis, Caldwell and Bloom get better soon please...  Also, let's go back in time and not let Amarikwa go."
tfc,31gepr,Trolloc,3,Sat Apr 4 21:04:15 2015 UTC,fuck Amarikwa. He's a little shit on the field.
tfc,31gepr,EasterlyFan,3,Sun Apr 5 03:37:46 2015 UTC,When will TFC learn that a head coach should not be learning how to coach. We keep picking inexperienced managers. Only some teams get lucky by taking this approach.
tfc,31gepr,mdps,2,Sun Apr 5 14:55:18 2015 UTC,"I am not with the sky is falling mentality yet but it is concerning how quickly they concede a goal after tying the game or taking the lead.  Also, it seems our opponents are getting multiple chances and these scores could be much worse.  Be interested to see adjustments next week and a healthy roster before I am too concerned."

tfc,30tea7,ididntsaygoyet,3,Tue Mar 31 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"There need to be more posts like this. Don't want people jumping ship so early, which frequently happens with Toronto sports fans in general."
tfc,30tea7,officialconwaytwitty,3,Mon Mar 30 17:41:05 2015 UTC,Meh. I doubt the people in this sub are the ones that are going to be giving up on the team after a few disappointing results.
tfc,30tea7,errboi,2,Mon Mar 30 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"Well I mean, I was never going to lose faith. Just a rocky start to the season, that's all. It's evident we need Bradley and Jozy back. I just wish our bye week was this past one."
tfc,30rg5v,LightsCameraRegret,16,Mon Mar 30 01:57:45 2015 UTC,What the fuck foul did you see Ref?
tfc,30rg5v,commradepolski,13,Mon Mar 30 02:04:54 2015 UTC,"Plus the ""offside"" call."
tfc,30rg5v,errboi,10,Mon Mar 30 02:16:52 2015 UTC,Still waiting for the alternate angle that PRO has that shows Hagglund actually ripped the guy's throat out or something.
tfc,30rg5v,Coramoor_,3,Mon Mar 30 02:07:16 2015 UTC,"Also love how they missed an offside in favour of RSL and called a phantom one against Finley, which admittedly he misplayed. Same line judge too, think he's going to get suspended, you just can't miss those types of calls."
tfc,30rg5v,warpus,15,Mon Mar 30 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"Just so you guys know MLS games are now broadcast on Polish TV using Polish commentators who seem to know all the players and the league well enough.  I was just at my dad's to watch the Poland-Ireland euro qualifying game, (so of course there's alcohol involved)...  and then after we ate dinner (more alcohol) I had to get going so that I can catch the TFC game..  He doesn't get cable, he has a box that only gets him a bunch of Polish channels.  But he tells me, ""Son, you can stay here and watch the TFC game here with me in Polish""  I didn't really know what to think of that, but.. he's flipping through the channels, and there's a bunch of fucking MLS games, each one all in Polish..  We found the TFC game and we watched it.  What sort of Polish dad magic is this??  The coverage was really good.  The announcers and their knowledge of the game impressed me, as did their knowledge of the players on the pitch.  It was better than what I usually get with TFC or MLS commentary.  So..  What is going on?   And when exactly did this happen?"
tfc,30rg5v,errboi,3,Mon Mar 30 02:17:46 2015 UTC,"Did the polish announcers make a big deal about the terrible reffing? Or is that just a North American persecution complex thing? I only ask because a lot of ""eurosnobs"" say things like ""MLS will never be a real league until the fix mickey mouse reffing"" and I'm interested in what people from other places actually think about the standards of the league."

tfc,30rg5v,currystain37,2,Mon Mar 30 16:51:28 2015 UTC,I watched it on Polish Eurosport too since my parents have a subscription online. The commentator seemed to do a good job at introducing both teams to an audience that probably knows very little if anything at all about them.

tfc,30rg5v,-notthesun-,8,Mon Mar 30 21:01:40 2015 UTC,"Even with another collapse, which was awful, we still should have gotten something out of this game. The refereeing in this league is a joke."
tfc,30rg5v,Coramoor_,7,Mon Mar 30 03:27:24 2015 UTC,"from /u/ktasay  Via twitter Chris Kamrani reported that after interviewing Grajeda post match, the Toronto goal was called back because:  ""Hagglund was called for holding. Previously on several occasions he had been warned about his holding.""  my comments:   combine this with the time hagglund was held on his entire run through the box and sometimes you just have to shake your head"
tfc,30rg5v,EasterlyFan,4,Mon Mar 30 03:36:58 2015 UTC,"I'm still mad, just because TFC is seemingly fucked all the time. It's brutal. It's tough to deal with.  That said, we lost the game. Jackson snagged us the 1 point, which would have been a victory in Salt Lake, but we gave it right back. Defending was bad. I know it was because we had to make some suicide-subs to apply some pressure, but even those guys should be able to get back. There was no marking.  Next week, even if we don't have Altidore and Bradley, we will have Perquis (hopefully) and Morrow back. Additionally, I think we should start Dike over Moore. I would have done that today as well, but now I would definitely like to. Moore didn't impress me last year and it was pissing me off when he was getting picked over Gil or Dike. Last night, things just looked better when Dike was on. He also is much more of a like-for-like swap with Altidore.   Please start Dike next match."

tfc,30rg5v,mdps,2,Mon Mar 30 16:54:15 2015 UTC,"Solid second half, I'd say.    Was a bit confused with the substitutions but we did a great job moving forward."
tfc,30rg5v,Bdog5,2,Mon Mar 30 02:17:25 2015 UTC,"Well, the substitutions worked."
tfc,30rg5v,Coramoor_,2,Mon Mar 30 02:40:44 2015 UTC,The Jackson sub helped get the goal but probably led to them scoring since we had midfielders playing back there with young CBs.    The subs wouldn't have been made if the ref wasn't fucking blind but you can't really expect MLS refs to know what they're doing. It should have been 1-1 from Hagglund's goal.
tfc,30rg5v,mdps,2,Mon Mar 30 03:13:59 2015 UTC,"doesn't seem that surprising, it was a suicidal charge for a goal, which worked, I assume Morgan was out of gas because he was phenomenal but aside from that it was fine."

tfc,30dk7x,mookeddit,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:59:10 2015 UTC,I said this would happen. How is it that this club keeps making the same mistake year after year?
tfc,30dk7x,loconet,2,Fri Mar 27 06:19:16 2015 UTC,There are very few teams in the league that have a really reliable 3rd CB. They are either a step down from being a starter or they are a starter for a different team. It's one of the realities of a salary cap league. You fill your depth positions with journeyman players and rookies who could be good but aren't really consistently good yet.
tfc,30dk7x,errboi,0,Fri Mar 27 06:58:05 2015 UTC,I don't care what other teams are doing. You are going to get in shit when your defence depends on a injury prone veteran.
tfc,30dk7x,loconet,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:09:00 2015 UTC,I don't know what to say to that except that other teams have made the playoffs and we haven't so maybe we all should care a little more about how other teams do things in this league. Or we can keep being special little snowflakes and forge our own path. That's certainly worked so far...
tfc,30dk7x,errboi,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:18:36 2015 UTC,Is Hagglund not a solid 3rd defender? are you expecting an MLS team to have 250k bench defenders or something?
tfc,30dk7x,Menessy27,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"At this point he's inconsistent, which is to be expected with a guy that's only got 1 year of professional experience under his belt. I think he's solid enough. I don't cringe when I see his name on the team sheet."

tfc,309a7e,Coramoor_,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:53:41 2015 UTC,Well that's convenient. So that makes TFCII more like TFC reserves.

tfc,309a7e,Menessy27,2,Thu Mar 26 03:01:36 2015 UTC,"Not sure this was a good use of one of their two (unsuccessful) appeals. Obviously biased by hind sight, of course. But they would have gotten Morrow back for an away non-conference game they're already severely under-manned for. They might have saved it for a more critical player, for a more important game, for less of a judgment call at a more critical time of the season. (And to head off the ineveitable, the call was wrong.)"
tfc,309a7e,a_lumberjack,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:23:11 2015 UTC,Poor decision but I would have been very surprised for them to go against their own referees especially when the referees union is one of the 3 panels voting on the play.

tfc,3076zh,warpus,7,Wed Mar 25 00:50:36 2015 UTC,So I made this..  http://i.imgur.com/52bhfqS.jpg?1
tfc,3076zh,mookeddit,4,Wed Mar 25 14:09:26 2015 UTC,You're hired!
tfc,3076zh,Coramoor_,7,Wed Mar 25 15:49:53 2015 UTC,"The purchase could lead to a great partnership, and help Canadian youth establish themselves in Europe.  However, I'm fearful this will have financial implications not only with TFC, but Raptors and Leafs. What do you guys think."
tfc,3076zh,Coramoor_,5,Wed Mar 25 00:52:34 2015 UTC,"why would it have financial implications, it seems idiotic because I don't see how this meshes with the goals of 2 Canadian telecom giants but they have the cash to pay the Parma debt no questions asked and run a team. I just don't see what this does for MLSE."
tfc,3076zh,Coramoor_,5,Wed Mar 25 01:13:19 2015 UTC,"Financial implications meaning priorities, obviously they want to buy Parma and have it run well enough to stay in Serie A. Whether that means not spending money in the other clubs, is the question. The money will always be there because MLSE are rich as hell, but will they spend, since they have a new club to manage, which is different than their North American ones."
tfc,3076zh,Coramoor_,4,Wed Mar 25 01:16:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think them wanting to buy Parma is actually obvious, it's a rumour right now.  If MLSE is looking to buy Parma, it isn't for Parma's sake, it's for how it fits into their strategy for Toronto. I can't see either Bell or Rogers randomly attempting to make a play in Italy, that would seem incredibly odd."
tfc,3076zh,TruckLife,4,Wed Mar 25 01:19:52 2015 UTC,Serie A is really poor right at the moment and now there are more foreign investors in Italy and across Europe than ever. I think MLSE wants to dip their hand into European football to add to their portfolio.
tfc,3076zh,warpus,2,Wed Mar 25 01:22:26 2015 UTC,they didn't even actively go after the NFL( Rogers did but that was a no hoper) though which is much closer to home and pretty much guaranteed to be more profitable. European expansion seems odd especially given there is no particular way you can market Parma as the team for Canadian Italians or something like that. If they are that committed to the futrue of Canadian soccer that they are looking to use Qatar style tricks I could maybe see it but that would seem very unlikely and a little too optimistic.
tfc,3076zh,TruckLife,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:26:41 2015 UTC,"They couldn't go for an NFL team because they needed a partner, corporations can't own an NFL team. Plus they don't need to market Parma to Canadians or Italian Canadians, they just want to expand their portfolio. If it makes money to own and run Parma whether soley or through a partnership, it can help MLSE overall."
tfc,3076zh,TruckLife,0,Wed Mar 25 01:49:56 2015 UTC,Larry Tanenbaum could act as a single person(outside of MLSE but with MLSE as the major backing) for the sake of the franchise. MLSE is very Toronto centric and is owned by the two huge telecom giants. I can't see what an Italian soccer club gives them. Saputo has a connection to the country and a passion for soccer so his purchase makes sense. For MLSE it seems far less clear why it would be done  edited for clarity
tfc,3076zh,TruckLife,2,Wed Mar 25 03:58:45 2015 UTC,"From a Toronto FC standpoint, I don't see how this can benefit the club. The only effect i can see at the moment is the change to Parma as the organizations flagship football club.  For the time being, I wouldn't mind seeing a top tier club with Canadian ownership."
tfc,3076zh,Swervitu,4,Wed Mar 25 01:59:03 2015 UTC,"From a Toronto FC standpoint, I don't see how this can benefit the club.    Here's one way: For the last couple years we've been sending scouts to Europe to look at players and find potential DPs.  Access to Parma's scouting network would allow us to tap into existing infrastructure for this purpose.. and beyond."
tfc,3076zh,Swervitu,3,Wed Mar 25 04:14:57 2015 UTC,Well that'd be fantastic.
tfc,306ajm,DisembodiedHand,3,Tue Mar 24 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"I know that I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, but it's time for an unpopular opinion (from a SSH): I don't have a problem with renovating in order to be able to host football.  There are a couple of reasons for this:  1) TFC plays at home fewer than 25 times per year.  2) The Argos would play at 'home' fewer than ten times per year.  3) The type of grass system that would be used is actually quite resilient - all the more so given that the two teams would be able to schedule around each other. With an average of a week between events, recovery time likely won't be as big a deal as it's made out to be.  4) Related to 3: Since the stadium isn't covered and can receive natural sunlight throughout the summer, the pitch should recover faster than the pitch at Wembley. (Yes, I know they're planning to cover the stands, but the effect on the turf won't be as pronounced as it is at Wembley.)  5) There are teams in the Premier League who share their stadium with rugby teams (I'm looking at you, Hull), and while there's some grumbling about it, it hasn't hampered their ability to attract better talent. In fact, you could say the same for PSG, whose home field is constantly re-purposed for other events. Simply put, the field conditions shouldn't ever deteriorate to the point that it drives players away.  6) The hate for the Argos only serves to paint TFC fans in the city - and soccer fans in general - in a negative light. No one is proposing that we go back to artificial turf, and a sense of perspective would be a nice thing to have. After all, we're talking about two fanbases who both feel like they don't get no respect. But TFC fans are the only ones who are whining about it. We sound like entitled teenage girls making it loud and clear that ""we don't want to share"".  Having said all that, I'm open to a rebuttal. Feel free to try to change my mind - I'll gladly listen! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go bunker down and wait for all the hate to rain down.  [Edit: minor formatting]"
tfc,306ajm,bruvark,2,Wed Mar 25 18:16:00 2015 UTC,"Happy Cake Day!  So here's a few things to think about.  1) TFC might play less than 25 times, but long runs of CCL and playoffs extend that. Then you have Mens and Womens national team games at the same time. Add in an occasional TFC2 game, reserve squad game and you're looking at a LOT more than 25 games played in a season.  2) The Argos won't play that much, but the intensity of damage of a pitch is severe.  3) It will be resilient but there will be damage.  4) Sun will help but what if there's a game scheduled for the Argos already and a CCL game or playoff game for TFC is forced into the schedule and you're playing 1 or 2 days apart from the Argos?  That's not enough time for it to recover.  5) I hope you are right on this but I don't have the same faith.  6) It's not hate for the Argos, for most of us it's complete disinterest, and that goes for the vast majority of Torontonians. In fact I know very few people who live downtown that care at all, I would suggest more Argos fans come from the burbs and not inner city where a decent portion of TFC fans come from.  The problem here isn't that we want the argos to fail, I wish them luck but I want them to have their OWN home, where they can be treated correctly instead of shoehorning it into a stadium that was in NO WAY built for CFL football.  We don't want to share because it took us, and Canada many decades to get a Soccer Specific Stadium, now we're taking that back and giving it to a sport with extremely low support in the city.   The point is, I'd love to see the Argos get a new stadium up at Downsview. It's on the subway line, it's near a major highway and those people who come to see Argos game will have easy access. Screwing with BMO is only going to piss off a lot of fans and many simply will not come back. We've put up with a LOT of bullshit over the last 8 years, this is the last straw for many."
tfc,306ajm,quelar,2,Wed Mar 25 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Truth be told, I didn't even realize it was my cake day until after I posted!  And thanks for the critique, here are a few more thoughts:  1) They actually only play 18 home games per year in regular season play. My estimate of 25 was including some buffer for those exact scenarios. And TFC2 has their own stadium in Vaughn, opening later this summer.  2) Agreed. Sorry if it seemed like I ignored that. Though football has an average of 12 minutes of action per game, while TFC games are 90-ish minutes of non-stop running and cutting. It's still more severe, but I think the effect is over-estimated.  3) Point 5 from my original post was meant to answer to that, in that I don't believe that the damage will be as severe as it would have been even 5 years ago. But we won't really be able to answer that question until it happens.  4) CCL games are scheduled well in advance, just as MLS playoff games are (we're talking multiple weeks). Similarly, MLS playoff game dates, which would be taking place at the same time as CFL, are placeholder-booked almost at the beginning of the season. I could see some contingency planning being worked into the schedules to accommodate for this (ex. TFC has a string of home games around the time when CCL matches are likely to be scheduled, or the Argos play their playoff games in the Skydome, since the Jays' season would already be over). In other words, because we know about the possible challenges far ahead of time, I think there are a lot of pretty easy things that could be done.  5) Maybe I'm being too optimistic, but I hope I'm right too!  6) I understand the feeling that we've been yanked around too much, but it's not worth taking it out on other teams/fans. And actually there are several different issues here that you've conflated:  a) Lack of interest in the Argos from 'downtown' people: The fact of the matter is that the same people who like the Argos pay for TFC tickets too. The GO train is always full of TFC fans, starting in Burlington and Pickering (AKA 'the burbs'), and the burbs is where the people who pay for the $2k season tickets live.  b) The Argos needing their own home: I don't buy it. Montreal doesn't have it, and they succeed just fine. I would, however, prefer them to use a field like UofT's Varsity Stadium. But it's worth remembering that other franchises have done their part to help out the Argos; TFC fans seem pretty selfish in comparison.  c) The Argos have little support in the city: This is correct, but it's also correct for TFC. We still struggle to be taken seriously by media and fans alike. Attendance numbers are actually not that much different (in 2013, for example, TFC's average attendance was just 1k higher). While I agree with this statement in principle, the numbers don't offer as convincing a picture as I once thought.  d) Soccer specific stadium: I agree insomuch as I would prefer this to be the case permanently. But looking at the events that have been held at BMO Field over the past few years (including another sport that's tough on the pitch, rugby), I don't think we could definitely say that there's been a noticeable decrease in pitch quality as a result. But again, we won't know until we know. The crux of it for me is that I don't see accommodating the Argos as a real threat to this.  e) TFC fans won't come back: As a life-long Leafs fan, I can't disagree with this more. Toronto loves sports more than any other city I've ever lived in. Does that make us suckers? Maybe. But if so, I'm the first one in that boat.  Having said all that again, I do agree with you with respect to Downsview. It would be amazing to get a new stadium done there. But until then, I sincerely don't think hosting the Argos at BMO Field would be as bad as some are making it out to be, for the reasons I've outlined above. Thanks for the discussion, though - it's great to hear from someone with a more nuanced viewpoint, rather than just, ""You must not be a real fan, then. Fuck the Argos."" Kudos!  [Edit: For the record, OP has a more nuanced viewpoint than ""you must not be a real fan, fuck the Argos"", as they proved with their comment. Just wanting to put that out there.]"
tfc,306ajm,bruvark,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"There's no reason for us to start infighting on this one, that's why an open discussion should be fostered.    So a few things to say, you and I clearly disagree on the amount of damage it will see. I guess this is one of those ""we'll have to see"" situation as we really don't know, we're just extrapolating from other situations that aren't really comparable.   The Argos don't necessarily need their ""own"" stadium, but having a separate stadium that better fits CFL would be nice. It would also allow for other organizations like Rugby Canada to pitch in and be a part of that stadium further removing any impact on BMO.   And lastly as for the fans? Lots will come back. I already know of at least a dozen hard core fans saying they'll sell off their season tickets next year due to this.  It's a dangerous game MLSE is playing with the fans, even if the impacts aren't as bad as some expect."
tfc,306ajm,quelar,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"Decent rebuttal Bruv but as Quelar states pretty well the impact will be more severe and frankly why take the risk. I think the negatives are being glossed over so that's a red flag. Our seasons are more severe than the UK so comparing to Hull isn't quite apples to apples...so the additional load that our pitch will receive in addition to a regular MLS season add in CFL season/playoffs/GreyCup is that when we want to test whether we were right about how well the pitch holds up?  Perhaps I was harsh in my postscript, which I'll take back, however I don't see a need to do the CFL/Argos any favours.   They would be better off in a solution that better fits them. Perhaps they can play at York U. Will have transit and near a highway. Get the Argos to pay for some added stands and bingo, problem solved."
tfc,306ajm,bruvark,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:48:38 2015 UTC,"You posted while I was replying to Quelar, so sorry that I didn't include this in my other reply!  The point you make about the seasons in Canada being more severe than those in Hull is an excellent one. I do think that we could plan around the playoffs pretty well, though. (The idea of the Argos playing home playoff games in the Skydome, since the Jays' season will be done anyway, stands out.)  Fair point re: doing favours, as well. From my perspective, I think it's always better in the long run to do a favour rather than ignore someone in need - but that's also a micro rather than macro perspective. And yeah, MLS in Canada is still struggling, so wasting effort helping someone else could definitely do more harm than good. I'm coming around a little bit on that point.  As I mentioned in my response to Quelar, I'd love to see the Argos at Varsity Stadium. I wonder what it would take to get this done. Thoughts?"
tfc,306ajm,bruvark,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"Personal favours for ""karma"" and just being nice? Sure.  Favours that affect your business and core product? Not a chance.   I think MLSE is looking at this strictly from a bottom line perspective, framing it as being nice with the CFL and nice from a PR viewpoint, but I think it's too fine a line to walk given that it will 100% impact TFC game experiences (fan and player)...and that is the core product of MLSE at BMO. So don't fuck with with I say.  Can the Argos make Varsity work? Not anymore give U of T reno'd Varsity years back. I think building a more permanent stand is not reasonable given the space...they'd have to remove the track at the very least and impact the neighbouring streets. The chance to do that has come and gone.  York presents the best/cheapest/least negative impact to get retrofitted for CFL. See the new digs built for the Pan Am games."
tfc,306ajm,supportingTFC,2,Wed Mar 25 19:24:35 2015 UTC,"I guess our disagreement is that I just don't think it will 100% impact TFC game experiences. But I'm willing to concede that it might. And given the new stadium at York (I wasn't aware of it's size), I'm totally willing to concede that that is a pretty darn good alternative.  From a business perspective, though, I still disagree a bit. I work in the entrepreneur/tech field, and one thing that's become pretty well accepted as common knowledge for us is that assuming trust works out better in the long run. Andrew Maxwell's done some pretty good research in this area, but essentially it boils down to the idea that doing favours generally works out better for your core business in the long run.  I know that MLSE is a multi-pronged giant, so I'll concede that this may not always mean that they put TFC's interests first. But there is one way that this arrangement could do that: Accommodating the Argos would mean expanded seating, which would mean additional revenue for TFC (after all, they still have a waiting list for season seats), which would allow them to invest more into the team. So in that sense, there is a business case to be made for doing the favour.  BUT, having said that, there's no guarantee that the money would be used on TFC, just as there's no guarantee that the property taxes you pay will by used by the government in ways that increase your property value. MLSE would be wise to make things a lot more transparent, perhaps through some sort of hypothecation for the revenue generated by the extra seats.  At this point, though, I'm thinking out loud a bit. Having seen the stadium at York, I'm actually leaning more towards that solution. Thanks for passing that along!"
tfc,306ajm,RadagastWiz,0,Wed Mar 25 19:43:31 2015 UTC,"My point re impact is that if there is one shred of an impact then that's no good. TFC at BMO is a Soccer purpose built stadium and to change the pitch and risk it for something that doesn't benefit TFC then it's a negative. I guess I'm looking at it as all or nothing. 40% is still a negative impact...so to me any impact above 0 is 100%...I don't bother to grade it. It's a yes or no scenario.   re Business perspective, it is definitely based on bottom line for MLSE. They need to increase ticket revenue and slowly raise ticket prices is to accomplish their projected growth. Seat expansion fast tracks this. The roof is to help keep butts in their seats longer and during bad weather increasing spending on concessions. If they really wanted to be world class they wouldn't have gone with a cheap version of the Stadium of Light for our reno. Remember, only east and west will be covered if we get the CFL.   I think it's good to hope for the best and trust in the doing favours business...however one should never make that favour if it means you're more than likely to negatively impact your core product. Do you think Steve Jobs would have done anyone a favour if it would have only 10% or 5% negatively impacted the iPhone product? Hell's no.   MLSE is not a start-up looking to share space or part time developers at a start-up incubator and neither is the Argos org. Don't kid yourself about the feel good side to this. MLSE knows that they are in the making money business from sport and that this decision could harm more than it helps."

tfc,302pes,TastyTacoTonight,-3,Tue Mar 24 00:03:28 2015 UTC,"It was only a matter of time.  The Argos do not have a home, and there were talks for years about them moving to BMO to share.    The attendance has been dwindling for a few years (Maybe not in #'s, but in gate attendance), so why would they explain to 30,000+ seats?  For a team that barely can do 15K gate attendance?  The stadium would still need another 20,000 seats to host a WC Match, so they could argue it's to show commitment for a 2026 WC Bid (joint with USA or solo).  It seems as if the TFC hype is slowly dying."

tfc,301ilg,sfw84,6,Mon Mar 23 21:14:51 2015 UTC,The USL side is mainly there for player development purposes.  You don't want to send near 40 year olds to TFC II unless they're going to be a coach or something.
tfc,301ilg,warpus,2,Tue Mar 24 01:36:33 2015 UTC,"so you wouldn't want someone with true mls experience, that still wanted to be a part of the club, helping the youngsters in the lower league develope so they can possibly move up to the main squad?"

tfc,301ilg,Menessy27,2,Tue Mar 24 02:56:00 2015 UTC,yeah lets never get veteran players on a team. that's just a stupid thought i have in my head. youth and youth only!
tfc,301ilg,sfw84,6,Tue Mar 24 03:09:25 2015 UTC,"Any minutes he gets as a player are just going to take away minutes from someone who needs them for development. I'm sad that DeRo's MLS career petered out the way it did, rather than getting the kind of sendoff that Landon Donovan got, but let's not sacrifice the development of talented young players in a vain attempt to relive the good ol' days."
tfc,301ilg,errboi,6,Tue Mar 24 05:36:00 2015 UTC,"I can see the benefit in that, but I think they will want to give those first team (tfc2) spots to younger player for the most part.  That's essentially why the team exists - so that younger players who are at that crucial stage of development get regular playing time in a professional atmosphere and league.  Every once in a while they'll throw in some fringe players, backup players, etc. into the mix, but the focus is going to be on youth.    If you have De Ro waltzing in there, that would take away a starting position from another player, and might even reduce any backup players for that position to never-game-time-getting sob status.  So if that's the case, you might as well have kept that player in the academy, or not drafted him in the first place, or whatever."

tfc,301ilg,errboi,2,Tue Mar 24 05:38:11 2015 UTC,That's one idea of how a great player should retire. Another idea is to have so much passion for the game that you don't give up until you're ready. Getting old sucks; why do it according to someone else's expectations?

His team seems to win most games and get a lot of their goals from penalties and crosses from freekicks/corners. Also it's interesting to see him basically being used as a target man as a lot of his chances are headers.  He has 4 goals so far I believe, 2 were penalties and 2 were just tap-ins into an open net.

tfc,2zx3jb,discostu81,3,Mon Mar 23 13:38:11 2015 UTC,Dike doesn't seem to be on Vanney's radar at all for some reason.
tfc,2zx3jb,Coramoor_,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:17:43 2015 UTC,"Dike would be my guess, he fits the Altidore style far more than Moore.  At least Osorio is still around."
tfc,2zx3jb,EasterlyFan,2,Mon Mar 23 02:22:46 2015 UTC,"Osorio still around is good, and I assume it is a favour from Floro to TFC since I think we can count on Osorio being out for World Cup qualifying as well as the Gold Cup.  I'm hoping Dike replaces Altidore, but I am expecting Moore. I am also expecting Warner for Bradley, hopefully he plays decently with Cheyrou but this is obviously a significant downgrade.  Keeping Giovinco is excellent, but I feel bad for him to not get called up by Italy. I hope this doesn't have anything to do with his MLS move.  In Toronto's favour, RSL is depleted as well. I believe they have 4 calls ups, the biggest and most notable being Nick Rimando which bodes well for our strikers. Maybe Gio will make a point the same way Defoe did after not getting his call up. I was hoping RSL would lose Beckerman, but it seems like he was overlooked."

Whats important is not so much joining a group but participating. If you join RPB, go out to some of their events or tifo paints. Join the community, get to know people.

tfc,2zpd10,discostu81,3,Fri Mar 20 14:48:44 2015 UTC,Morgan is a bit of a surprise but the rest make total sense.
tfc,2zpd10,R00K416,8,Fri Mar 20 14:51:03 2015 UTC,"I expect that he will be recalled in 1 weeks time when we take on RSL.  He could use some confidence, especially if he's going to have to start in place of Morrow."
tfc,2zpd10,mdps,2,Fri Mar 20 15:23:48 2015 UTC,"I agree that he'll probably be recalled, but I don't think he deserves the start. I'd move Creavale to left and start Bloom on the right."
tfc,2zpd10,errboi,4,Fri Mar 20 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time convincing myself Creavalle at fullback is anything other than a right-footed American version of Ashtone Morgan. They are both pretty suspect defensively and they're both at their best when they are allowed to get forward and attack. Why not play the naturally left-footed guy who actually has considerable experience as a fullback at least?   Edit: How about if you disagree with me you say why instead of just downvoting. I'm honestly interested in hearing what other people think, which is part of why I offered my own opinion on the matter."
tfc,2zpd10,mdps,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"You make a good point about their comparative strengths and Morgan's footedness. In my opinion, Bloom is the best defender of the three and Creavalle is better going forward than Morgan. Given the number of players missing, I don't think Vanney will attack as aggressively, so I don't think he needs both Creavalle and Morgan in the game.    And in case you were wondering, I didn't up- or down-vote any post on this thread, including yours."
tfc,2zpd10,errboi,1 point,Fri Mar 20 23:30:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was meant as a more general ""you"". I agree that we don't need both Creavalle and Morgan in the game, I'd just rather see Bloom and Morgan. I think people underestimate how difficult it can be to transition from playing fullback on one side to playing on the other side. Creavalle is already questionable with his defending, it could get really ugly if he's playing on his weak side. Or it could be okay. I'd rather see Morgan get a chance, assuming he has a good showing with TFC II this weekend."
tfc,2zpd10,Menessy27,0,Fri Mar 20 23:59:08 2015 UTC,Creavalle is nothing like Morgan... he is a versatile defensive minded player and always has been. He gets forward because that's what the coach asks of the fullbacks in this formation. On the other hand Morgan can barely even defend and only serves to go forward but he doesn't even seem to do that well anymore.
tfc,2zpd10,errboi,1 point,Sat Mar 21 00:19:04 2015 UTC,"We haven't seen Morgan make more than a Cameo in over a year now. There's no way to know what he could do going forward if he was given the same kind of run Creavalle seems to be getting in the first team. I'll definitely be tuning in tomorrow night to see how he does at TFC II. Plus ""versatile"" in MLS is just a buzzword for ""player who doesn't quite fit anywhere"" and if he's so defensive minded then why is he only good going forward? Last year Creavalle didn't look good when asked to be a stay at home fullback, he did get on the score sheet when he played as a midfielder though."
tfc,2zpd10,Menessy27,0,Sat Mar 21 05:43:47 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? Creavalle is not good going forward and never has been. He is a defensive player. He has 4 goals in 2 assists in about 65 games in MLS and that's playing the majority of the time as a midfielder. Creavalle didn't look good defensively last year because by the time he came in the team was a joke and the centerback pairing was a rookie and a 21 year old.  As for Morgan, he hasn't had a cameo in over a year because he got replaced by Morrow after a bad season where he showed no improvement. If he was good the team wouldn't have felt the need to go out and get a starting left back. He has never been good defensively but he can't even beat a man or put in a good cross anymore so where is the benefit of playing him exactly? that he happens to be Canadian?"
tfc,2zpd10,errboi,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:30:27 2015 UTC,"Morgan took a step back at the start of that season but you're kidding yourself if you think he didn't improve towards the end of the season again. As for Creavalle, he was laughable as a RB last season. Almost as bad as Jackson was. Even after returning from injury Bloom didn't look singlehandedly responsible for almost every goal scored against us the way Creavalle did when he played RB. You can't blame the backline as a whole when Bloom didn't look like shit in that back line and he had just returned from injury."

No one in their right mind would rate Defoe over any of the players called up.      Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur) - Is a god. Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) - Almost holds the record for England goals. Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool) - Determined to stay injured forever. Danny Welbeck (Arsenal) - Fuck united."
tfc,2zlm8b,notdarren,10,Thu Mar 19 16:59:37 2015 UTC,It's not a surprise.. that's precisely the point. Everybody under the sun knew Defoe wasn't gonna be called up regardless of whether he was in England or Toronto.. but apparently around the world cup he decided it was our fault that he wasn't called up.   Now it is clear to him that it didn't matter. He is still not called up.. Only that this time he is probably gonna blame Sunderland instead of just admitting that it's him.

tfc,2zlm8b,Joao_Platypus,2,Thu Mar 19 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"haha thanks.  Off the top of my head, Rickey Lambert, Darren Bent, Peter Crouch? It's just opinion of course but I've never seen any of those guys get as hot as Kane is right now. They may well be better than Defoe, but they're colder than a rainy night in Stoke right now  Gabriel ""Swag"" bonlahor, Andy ""The Christmas"" Carroll  Kind of surprised at no Crouch and no Carroll tbh, normally they bring one big gangly guy with them"
tfc,2zlm8b,notdarren,2,Thu Mar 19 17:12:05 2015 UTC,"Lambert/Carroll/Crouch would be good to bring.     Sturridge seems to be able to sort of start doing what they do, but not quite there, don't think he ever will be.     Charlie Austin would be nice to see as well.     Maybe England isn't bringing a big guy this year because we're going to actually play football.   Who knows."

tfc,2zlm8b,notdarren,3,Thu Mar 19 18:09:43 2015 UTC,"I think it just gives a different style of play.  Losing 1-0 in the 80th minute?  Lob the ball to Carroll who win's 90% of his aerial duels.  Passes the ball to Rooney.  Then the announcer can scream ""AND IT'S ROONNEYY!"""

From my vantage point it looked like he was elbowed. But this is worse. Hope that he recovers quickly.  Rovers vs Charlton

Why keep a guy on this early in the season when we've just been fucked by the ref and he's been out from leg problems before?  Seems like they decided the game was probably a write-off and to rest him for the second half instead of risking it.
tfc,2zauob,FinestStateMachine,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"Not doubting the concerns, but rather questioning the implications. I think you keep the guy in a 0-0 conference game in week 2 -- unless the injury concern is a serious one."
tfc,2z59rf,Pauloman9191,5,Sun Mar 15 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree re: throwing things on the pitch.  I think that Bloom is definitely a better defender than Creavalle. Creavalle might be better going forward, which is pretty important in Vanney's tactics. Someone just needs to take Creavalle aside during training, show him where the goal is and explain what it means to be between your man and the net. He let him man behind him too easily too often. I think Bloom definitely deserves a chance to show he can fit into Vanney's tactics though.  Our refs are not great. Gantar is possibly the worst of the lot and given his history with our club it's shocking he was allowed to ref another one of our games. That being said, there are poor refs all over the world, so some of the worst in the world might be a bit hyperbolic."
tfc,2z59rf,errboi,2,Sun Mar 15 20:12:21 2015 UTC,"When it comes to horrible refs two guys that come to my mind are Toledo, and Salazar"
tfc,2z59rf,mdps,3,Sun Mar 15 21:11:00 2015 UTC,The thing with Toledo is he'll go 70 minutes officiating a great game and suddenly decide that he needs to give a penalty kick and a couple of red cards. Gantar on the other hand is just waiting for the most opportune moment to make the single worst call of the week.
tfc,2z59rf,hurleyburleyundone,2,Mon Mar 16 17:24:41 2015 UTC,Gantar and Petrescu come to mind as well. But those two you mentioned seemed to hate us .

I don't care if you throw it over fellow supporters and onto the field but, holy shit, don't throw it over kids/home supporters.  EDIT- Saying that, Crew should never of put families there."
tfc,2z59rf,errboi,2,Sun Mar 15 22:32:17 2015 UTC,"I rate Creavalle over Bloom personally.  Not the first time this ref has made himself a storyline..., (Last season Gilberto dissallowed goal for no reason vs Chicago).  They had some chances but playing half a game down a man caught up to them."
tfc,2z59rf,juanroberto,0,Sun Mar 15 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"Why do you rate Creavalle over Bloom? I feel like Bloom is more defensively disciplined and his one of the top 6-8 RB's in the league. He's not really flashy, but he always connected really well with possession based midfielders in front of him. He was less involved in the attack when our right flank attack plan was ""have Jackson or Oduro run really really fast."""
tfc,2z59rf,Coramoor_,3,Sun Mar 15 20:39:35 2015 UTC,"Creavalle kinda reminds of when Ashtone was a starter but with less defensive capabilities, when Ashtone was a mainstay, i dont exactly remeber but i think maybe 2-4 seasons ago, he would blaze up the line cross the ball into the box, which also what seemed like the game plan back then. Bloom might not be as offensive minded, but last season there were a few times when he was pushing up and creating chances. But what kills me with Creavalle starting is he is just such a defensive liability, which is not what we need on our defense."
tfc,2z59rf,juanroberto,2,Sun Mar 15 21:05:29 2015 UTC,"I think Creavalle is a stronger athlete, and more talented with the ball. He started for the 2013 Dynamo who made it to the Conference Finals, and Quarters in Champs League. * Edit: He started 17 league games that season.  His natural position is in the mid, but I don't think that means he can't  makre adjustments s he learns the spot.  I feel like a lot of TFC fans overrate Bloom. I think he's a perfect back up for out wide defensive spots, but I just don't really think he is staring caliber on a play off team."
tfc,2z59rf,Coramoor_,2,Mon Mar 16 00:30:19 2015 UTC,"That's all well and good but Creavalle's crossing has been very poor and until it gets better, it would be better to have the stronger defensive player in. He got burned really easily a bunch of times last night for no real reason"
tfc,2z59rf,errboi,1 point,Mon Mar 16 00:36:36 2015 UTC,"Blooms crossing is pretty bad from what i've seen.   If we're gunna play a possession oriented/ lots of short passing type of attack, I feel more comfortable with Creavalle over Bloom.  Bloom is stronger defensively, but I don't think Creavalle can't make up that ground as he climatizes to the position."
tfc,2z59rf,juanroberto,4,Mon Mar 16 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"Bloom is fine in short passing, give and go type plays. At this point I'd prefer the stronger defensive option if both are going to cross poorly."
tfc,2z59rf,errboi,3,Mon Mar 16 00:47:13 2015 UTC,Crevalle looks so fucking awkward on the ball. He's all legs. If Caldwell is an octopus with his wavy arms in the box then Creavalle is a daddy long legs.  Edit: names are hard.

tfc,2z49ir,Barthez_Battalion,7,Sun Mar 15 12:37:14 2015 UTC,"I think he desperately needs  to spend a season with the USL Pro team. If he can re-establish himself at that level then bring him back up and let him try to win his starting spot back. Unfortunately we have no one else on the roster who can play left back behind Morrow, so he's not going to get that opportunity."
tfc,2z49ir,errboi,2,Sun Mar 15 13:41:19 2015 UTC,He is 24. He is not going down to USL. He stays with TFC or moves on if not good enough.
tfc,2z49ir,apot1,2,Sun Mar 15 16:03:03 2015 UTC,"You're right that he's not going down to USL, but it has more to do with not having backup. USL Pro is not the same as USL PDL; there are no restrictions on player age."
tfc,2z49ir,errboi,2,Sun Mar 15 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"the second goal he was in the correct position and Perquis was out to lunch. Given how little he has played and that they were down to 10 men, I'd say he performed adequately."
tfc,2z49ir,Coramoor_,3,Sun Mar 15 17:31:18 2015 UTC,Morgan did not do too bad. They were down to 10 men and made no real mistake. On the goal he kept Finley covered and the cross was unmarked by the rest of the defence. The coach seems to have a lot of confidence in him. Not sure what game you were watching.
tfc,2z49ir,apot1,2,Sun Mar 15 16:00:01 2015 UTC,He's a Canadian backup... why would they get rid of him? how good do you think backup fullbacks in MLS are supposed to be?
tfc,2z49ir,Menessy27,0,Sun Mar 15 17:24:50 2015 UTC,I'd expect them to be competent defensively. Morgan is not a great defender. It's not really his fault last night though. His strength lies in getting forward and creating number advantages in order to get crosses in and he was brought into a situation where TFC were never going to have significant periods of attack where that could happen.
tfc,2z49ir,errboi,0,Sun Mar 15 20:50:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I'd like to see him and bloom play attacking wingbacks to a back three."
tfc,2z49ir,TruckLife,1 point,Sun Mar 15 23:52:32 2015 UTC,"Bloom is not an attacking minded RB but is very strong defensively, Creavalle is probably the stronger bet as a wingback."
tfc,2z49ir,MLSNHL,2,Thu Mar 19 00:00:31 2015 UTC,We need to send him to Bayern to train with Lahm /wishfulthinking.
tfc,2z49ir,Hieberrr,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"On a lot of plays Columbus overloaded the centre causing Perquis and Morgan to have to move in to cover. There was always going to be a man open for the Crew when it's 11-on-10.   Morgan made a few mistakes, such as over committing egregiously on the one block and exiting the play, but most of it can be chalked up to rustiness from being on the bench so long. He also stopped a number of crosses and was able to get forward in a few attacks.   Truth is multiple players were unimpressive compared to the performance in Vancouver, it just happens that Morgan is the preferred Canadian scapegoat of the moment."
tfc,2z49ir,FinestStateMachine,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:15:51 2015 UTC,You guys think they'll call up new Canadian Skylar Thomas this year?
tfc,2z49ir,dawtcalm,0,Wed Mar 18 00:16:35 2015 UTC,"I personally find it tough to say how long he has, just gotta wait till it plays out, but against Columbus, to me he looked shaking and you could really tell that having not played in the MLS for quite some time has taken a toll. Also once he came on Columbus just kept charging his side, you had Finlay, Kamara, and Higuain, all just terrorizing that side when Morgan was on"
tfc,2z49ir,Pauloman9191,0,Mon Mar 16 01:02:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agree with that entire post OP. Liability the entire time he was on the pitch, we need another LB for cover for Morrow. Morgan just simply isn't good enough. I guess he could try and re-establish him in the USL as already mentioned but I really do think his time is up here."

tfc,2z37e3,TruckLife,14,Sun Mar 15 09:46:55 2015 UTC,I'd mind if he plays like he did yesterday. I think Morgan's future is USL Pro/NASL.

tfc,2z37e3,Bdog5,2,Sun Mar 15 17:22:58 2015 UTC,Never a red. Hopefully it gets rescinded and i'm just going to stop talking about it now... We don't even have a game next week to forget about this garbage referee costing us yet another game either.
tfc,2z37e3,Menessy27,2,Sun Mar 15 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"Why does it feel like the MSL is the only league where we have at least on absolutely wrong call each and every goddamn week.

tfc,2z2wlj,CompletelyUnbaised,7,Sun Mar 15 03:41:28 2015 UTC,"Can't say too much due to the red card, but we certainly could have done better despite that. Even before the card cc looked a level above us. What was even more annoying was the sub of Warner for giovinco. Why make a defensive sub at this point. We are 2-0 down, a man down, and ten min to go when the sub was made, what do we have to lose?! Why not keep on a fast decisive forward like seba to try to claw one back on the break? Why bring on a slow DM? I know getting a draw at that point would be an absolute miracle, but I'd take the chance at getting it or losing 3-0 over just losing with only one shot in the second half."
tfc,2z2wlj,SamosasWithoutBordrs,1 point,Sun Mar 15 02:11:05 2015 UTC,"Resting gio. Giving up on points. I sure had at that point.  Also, warner was last touch on our best (only?) chance of the half."

tfc,2z2wlj,currystain37,6,Sun Mar 15 03:25:49 2015 UTC,"The red card was definitely bullshit, but that doesn't excuse us not being able to defend crosses. I don't remember us having one clearance from a cross at all. Hopefully we'll do better against RSL and Morrow's card gets revoked. Morgan pissed me off too much."
tfc,2z2wlj,Menessy27,3,Sun Mar 15 01:45:46 2015 UTC,"It's all cause and effect. Columbus not only have an extra man in the box but also are able to commit more forward because there's much less threat of an attack when they're down to 10 men.   TFC wasn't at their best but that doesn't excuse an awful, game-altering call and just because TFC wasn't playing well it doesn't mean they couldn't have drawn or even won the game as we saw last week when Columbus played Houston."
tfc,2z2wlj,hurleyburleyundone,2,Sun Mar 15 02:24:08 2015 UTC,Morgan and Creavalle were shite today. But the red was absolutely garbage. The referee was the same who took away Gilberto's goal last season.
tfc,2z2wlj,SanStarko,2,Sun Mar 15 01:50:31 2015 UTC,"We never played very well start to finish so I don't think it's a collapse.   It's an away loss, I didn't expect TFC to go unbeaten this year. The Red Card made it worse. Regroup and Move on."
tfc,2z2wlj,theskizo,2,Sun Mar 15 04:37:09 2015 UTC,"A lot of attention will no doubt goto the red card.  But even before that red card we looked pretty poor.  I've seen others say they felt the First Half was quite even, and yes we did have chances but I felt that for the second game running we were setup completely wrong for the opposition.     Regardless of that though, in the Second Half our defending in was laughable.  Yes we were down to ten men but that's no excuse for the struggle we were having defending crosses and the amount of guys we kept leaving unmarked in the box."

tfc,2yotsb,imotadin,5,Thu Mar 12 00:53:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll bite. I think we've got a great starting lineup, but our depth is pretty poor. If Cheyrou or Bradley get injured the backup is Warner. That's a serious drop in quality. In fact, there's this huge gulf in quality between most of our starters and their backups. Morrow to Morgan, Giovinco to Moore or Chapman (or Lovitz if you want to push Osorio inside to Giovinco's position), Altidore to Dike, even Caldwell/Perquis to Hagglund is a step down just because Hagglund is still young and relatively inexperienced. We've got a great starting XI that could compete with most teams in NA but we've already (for years now) seen how well relying on your starting XI to stay healthy all season long works.  Edit: forgot a word"
tfc,2yotsb,errboi,3,Thu Mar 12 12:44:21 2015 UTC,"Having said that, I'm still pumped for this season and am expecting TFC find a way to not completely screw up."
tfc,2yotsb,errboi,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:45:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but to be fair I think our depth this year is better than usual.  One of the reasons there is such a large gap in quality between the starters and their backups is an unusually strong starting 11 this season.  I think it would be incredibly hard, if not impossible, to increase the quality of our depth players while staying under the cap.  One positive I'm seeing is that a lot of them are young and in some cases very promising..  The season is long and these youngins are going to get some playing time - it's going to be great for their development, but like you said might hurt the team as a whole due to the severe drop in quality and experience.  My main concern is a long term Giovinco absence.   Cheyrou being out for a while we could cope with..  and Bradley might be problematic too..  But either way if one of Cheyrou or Bradley gets injured - we still have one solid DM on the books.  If Giovinco gets injured - we have to shuffle things around."
tfc,2yotsb,warpus,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:57:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, The Gold Cup could end up hurting us. With Bradley, Altidore, Osorio, and maybe Morgan being gone for a significant chunk of time. I think Morrow could also possibly win himself another call up to the USMNT if he has a good start to the season."
tfc,2ylkhk,mookeddit,3,Tue Mar 10 20:32:56 2015 UTC,So excited for this year.  I think on the same level as when the team first came in the league.  Maybe more.
tfc,2ylkhk,Praetor80,-5,Tue Mar 10 21:20:07 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of week one last year. Let's hope he doesn't pretend to get hurt and run back to England. I hate you, Jermaine Defoe. Congrats though, Jozy. Keep popping them in, and make us your second home, like Bradley did."

tfc,2yl6lr,warpus,7,Tue Mar 10 19:04:04 2015 UTC,This is the only correct answer.  To fill it out a bit we played well last weekend but it's a long season and team chemistry and injuries will play a major factor in how well we do.

tfc,2ykhl3,coachkon,2,Tue Mar 10 20:52:20 2015 UTC,"I think the one-united supporters group idea has been around since 2007.  Everyone should be happy with how it is now, the SG's work together, travel together and even hang out together.  We acknowledge the little differences and so be it.

I'm not really a fan of having people speak for me as well, like if someone were to say ""we are a group think this should be done"".    I also went to a bar for a season opener a few years back, one of the groups was there, since that was their home bar. Our table kept getting asked if we had paid that year's dues and what we thought of the potential new tunes. Which I guess is fine, but not during the match, they seemed more in to getting their group organized than on the actual act of watching their team play."

Most of the banners and flags you see (including the two large ones at the Columbus match today) were made by people that can be bothered to still be involved in supporter groups.  When you can achieve more with yourself and six buddies than a group of 200 people, there is a major problem."

tfc,2yg8ik,hurleyburleyundone,3,Mon Mar 9 19:23:20 2015 UTC,24th minute not 27.   Might explain the disconnect in some sections.
tfc,2yg8ik,quelar,2,Mon Mar 9 19:28:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the correction. It's been a few months.
tfc,2yg8ik,hurleyburleyundone,4,Mon Mar 9 19:38:46 2015 UTC,"TFC has a long and illustrious history.  4 straight Canadian championships from 2009-2012.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Championship#By_year  Perhaps TFC's biggest highlight was beating the LA Galaxy (and David Beckham) in the CONCACAF champions league quarterfinals in 2012.  http://www.thestar.com/sports/soccer/2012/03/14/toronto_fc_beats_la_galaxy_to_reach_champions_league_semifinals.html  The first leg in that tie was played at Rogers Centre and had 47,658 fans.  That was pretty cool.  Longest MLS playoff drought.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MLS_club_post-season_droughts#Longest_all-time_droughts  TFC has two players on their wall of honour.  Danny Dichio and Jim Brennan.  TFC was key in creating MLS 2.0.  (Basically having engaged Euro-style supporters groups, and dreaming big for the league.  MLS 1.0 was all about having a low cost family-friendly sporting event.)  Support was great for several years while the team was bad.  But fans have become disillusioned.  The past few years there have been a lot of empty seats in the stands in the 2nd half of the year (even if the tickets were sold).  MLSE who owns the team (and the Maple Leafs and Raptors) is rich.  Over the past few seasons they've been throwing money at the club to solve the problem, but the on-field product has not improved.  People thought that things would change last year (with Bradley, Defoe and Gilberto) and they didn't really.  Now people are hopeful again with new signings Altidore and Giovinco.  But it's a wary hope."

tfc,2yalhh,R00K416,10,Sun Mar 8 04:22:56 2015 UTC,We were getting absolutely destroyed on the counter in the first half. I think the second half went well because Vancouver stopped pressing for some reason. A win is a win however. I'll take it. WOOOOO
tfc,2yalhh,lucastimmons,6,Sun Mar 8 01:10:25 2015 UTC,"Caldwell didn't look up to the counter attack, we should really keep an eye on this as Hagglund would probably work better for this.  Caldwell > Hagglund overall, but Hagglund and Perquis are faster and would probably work better for those long through balls.  That or keeping our fullbacks back.    Either way, I'll take this win as a good win and a great learning experience."
tfc,2yalhh,notdarren,5,Sun Mar 8 02:13:41 2015 UTC,"It went better because we stopped playing a high line. My guess is Vanney didnt want to sit deep because that would give guys like Rosales and Morales a lot of time on the ball, but as it turned out neither of them really played well so sitting deep worked in the 2nd half. It also looked like we changed formations, Osorio was a lot more central in the second half which added another body in the midfield and offered more protection for the defense"
tfc,2yalhh,Menessy27,3,Sun Mar 8 04:22:11 2015 UTC,"Everything you said + pressing like that for 90 minutes is incredibly tiring.  So hard to do for a whole game, not to mention the season opener."
tfc,2yalhh,jztrumpeter,6,Sun Mar 8 05:12:15 2015 UTC,"Wow!  First half was shaky but we looked great in the second half.  I think Vancouver got tired out mostly, because the sort of stopped doing the long balls onto whatever side Creavalle was playing.    Altidore with two goals?  /r/soccer is going to throw a fit.  Giovinco is absolutely great.  Bradley killed the momentum we had going forwards sometimes, he likes to pass back to the CBs a lot."
tfc,2yalhh,LightsCameraRegret,4,Sun Mar 8 01:08:46 2015 UTC,"Kekuta Manneh is extremely fast and really good with the ball.  I've followed that kid for a while now and really enjoy his football.  He got a few games last season, and if he has got his way into the first time this year that's great for him.  He would have been destroying (and was against Caldwell and other) whoever would have played RB."
tfc,2yalhh,notdarren,2,Sun Mar 8 02:08:33 2015 UTC,Fair enough then!  Although I do think Creavalle was playing too high either way.
tfc,2yalhh,LightsCameraRegret,3,Sun Mar 8 03:19:55 2015 UTC,I think that's also why Creavalle is there instead of Bloom at the moment.    Creavalle has way more pace than Bloom.  He CAN track back quicker.
tfc,2yalhh,notdarren,1 point,Sun Mar 8 03:49:25 2015 UTC,his job is to determine if we should be going forward - i'll trust his judgement on that - he was a beast controlling our temp from the back.  i'll take that over rushing forward any day.
tfc,2yalhh,Boethius13,6,Mon Mar 9 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"Decent start, didn't expect us to be fully gelled with so many new guys again, but we looked decent.  Most impressive thing for me was when it got to the last ten minutes we didn't panic, drop deep and invite Vancouver onto us.  Well we did for a couple of minutes then quickly switched to pushing up the pitch and looked quite composed.       Giovinco was decent, but I didn't feel he was at the level he can play at yet.  That's not a bad thing, just that I feel when he fully settles in he's going to be way beyond anything he did today.  He did tend to go down at every slight touch though, but I'll let him off with that.  Even moreso given it seemed to be really pissing off Vancouver and their fans.     Nice start for Altidore too.  Is that more goals today than he scored in his whole time at Sunderland?"
tfc,2yalhh,SanStarko,3,Sun Mar 8 01:13:51 2015 UTC,"Good win by the boys! We looked very shaky in the first half, but we came out big in the second. Bendik played well, Perquis was amazing, Giovinco and Altidore also had great debuts. Let's hope we play like we did in the second half for the rest of the season."
tfc,2yalhh,currystain37,4,Sun Mar 8 01:12:45 2015 UTC,"That was beautiful. Wish Osorio'd scored that fourth one in extra time, though."
tfc,2yalhh,FinestStateMachine,5,Sun Mar 8 01:22:12 2015 UTC,"Last year we would have conseded a goal in the 90th minute to bring it back to a tie, this year we push foreward for more"
tfc,2yalhh,balapete,3,Sun Mar 8 02:12:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah slow start but the middle part of the game was dominated by TFC. We can finally keep possession!  Defence seemed weak at times but Bendik was good. Midfield was playing well and Cheyrou is going to be a good player for us. Giovinco probably needs to adapt to the league but already you can tell how good he'll be.  Finally there's Altidore, my one worry for him was that his form might suck after playing in England but he already scored more than he did there in one game. hehehe"
tfc,2yalhh,ryulaaa,1 point,Sun Mar 8 01:59:59 2015 UTC,i think altidore was a great addition this year. i think we have a real shot at the playoffs this year. what a season opener

That being said, I am hoping he proves us wrong completely and stays coach for at least an entire season as I think that will be a record for us."
tfc,2yat9b,notdarren,4,Sun Mar 8 02:46:29 2015 UTC,"We came back as a different team in the second half. The defence looked way better, it may be premature to say it was due to coaching, but it's a step forward."
tfc,2yat9b,fuzz_boy,3,Sun Mar 8 03:27:27 2015 UTC,"Have to agree, I'm against unproven coaches. I was anti-Nelsen from the start however I'm a little more lenient with Vanney just due to the fact he knows the MLS game and was with our academy.  The constant change of coaches needs to stop, we'll never get anywhere with the way we deal with coaches."
tfc,2yat9b,TorontoFC15,2,Sun Mar 8 16:26:16 2015 UTC,"You don't think he outcoached Robinson last night? He adjusted in the second half, and Vancouver became toothless.  Vanney may be inexperienced, but he got all his badges (in France im pretty sure) and when you listen to the player interviews from the new guys, several of them (Gio, Cheyrou) directly referenced Vanney's vision as a big part of why they came."

tfc,2y515u,notdarren,8,Fri Mar 6 14:56:09 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd still stick with Bloom.     As /u/section111 said, Creavalle impressed in preseason, but from what I saw of him last season was his positioning and connection with the rest of the defense was still pretty bad.    Hopefully that is improved.     But for now I'd still rate Bloom."
tfc,2y515u,Kim_Jong_Unchained,4,Fri Mar 6 15:55:20 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go with Bloom, but if Vanney feels Creavalle earned the spot in preseason I trust his judgement"
tfc,2y515u,R00K416,4,Fri Mar 6 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know, because we haven't played a single game this season.  If Creavalle has been better in preseason like Vanney suggests, then let him be the starter on opening day. That's the way it should be."
tfc,2y515u,section111,3,Fri Mar 6 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"Based on last year, it'd have to be Bloom, of course. But I liked Creavalle in the pre-season a lot, so I'd go with him."
tfc,2y515u,rickyforr,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:37:10 2015 UTC,Creavalle based on preseason. Looks a bit more dynamic than Bloom. Bloom is solid but the way we are playing this year means the RB and LB will have to play up in the midfield (basically act as wingers) often. I think Creavalle maybe better suited for this.   Bloom is better defensively but I like having Creavalle and Morrow pushing up the wings...could cause a lot of problems for the opposition
tfc,2y515u,Menessy27,1 point,Fri Mar 6 17:43:43 2015 UTC,Bloom was better last season and Creavalle has been better in preseason. I don't mind either one really but i'd go with the guy in better form right now which is Creavalle. It should also be noted that Creavalle came in past midseason to a struggling team with a bunch of injuries so i'd prefer to judge his play on right now rather than last season.
tfc,2y515u,EasterlyFan,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:05:19 2015 UTC,I'd go with Bloom. I think Creavalle is getting the look because he is a little more offensively oriented (something Vanney really values in Morrow) but unfortunately I don't think Creavalle is nearly as good as Bloom when it comes to defending. And that's what he is there to do.
tfc,2y515u,tfcfreak23,1 point,Sat Mar 7 04:21:20 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  I think Creavalle is better at short passes, but Bloom has some pretty good crosses as well."

tfc,2y56wv,BanksKnowsBest,2,Fri Mar 6 15:45:56 2015 UTC,I love that we have a reserve team now! It will definitely benefit the teams development down the road. I like the college system but not for football(soccer). I will be going down to a few games this year to support the second team. Lets hope the rest of the league take this route and someday have a strong developmental league. It will only make the mls better and attract better younger players to the league.
tfc,2y56wv,ryulaaa,2,Fri Mar 6 16:30:49 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree less w.r.t. Bendik. Goaltender stats mean little when you have teenagers and rookies as your central defence. Bendik lacks distribution sense, for sure, but he's an excellent keeper for the task at hand."
tfc,2y56wv,mdps,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:13:39 2015 UTC,definitely. His distribution even drastically improved last season as he demonstrated he knows how to throw the ball sometimes instead of just kicking it long every time.

tfc,2y2fbu,jztrumpeter,6,Thu Mar 5 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"We look fairly good depth-wise in all positions, IMO.   The one thing that does worry me slightly is Giovinco not having a proper backup..  well, he sort of does in Osorio or a 2nd striker like Moore..  so I'm not worried too much, but if anything that's one area that seems a bit lacking - it either means that with Gio out we only have Lovitz on the left or we change the way we play a bit..  then again I have no idea about the versatility of some of our newer players or our exact tactical approach once the season starts..  so all in all my verdict is: we're in pretty good shape overall."
tfc,2y2fbu,warpus,2,Fri Mar 6 01:22:23 2015 UTC,"So, what is the general consensus on the defensive core? Will it be enough? I think that the forwards and midfielders look okay but I'm worried about the defense. Hoping for a good season opener on Saturday!"
tfc,2y2fbu,TicklezPanda,2,Thu Mar 5 21:47:21 2015 UTC,"I guess I can see why they'll start Creavalle, but I feel comfortable with Bloom as well in that slot. The back line looks really solid to me, barring injuries."
tfc,2y2fbu,buddychiefpal,3,Thu Mar 5 23:29:45 2015 UTC,The only possible reason to start Creavalle over Bloom is if Bloom is injured.
tfc,2y2fbu,errboi,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"I'd agree, but they seem to be using Creavalle instead. Seems like every coach has that one player he rates much lower than thr fanbase, Bloom might be that guy this year"

Caldwell and Perquis are both quality, experienced centerbacks that looked really strong in preseason though, Morrow is one of the best LBs in MLS and having two capable starting rightbacks is good"
tfc,2y2fbu,Menessy27,2,Fri Mar 6 19:10:10 2015 UTC,creavalle is our weak spot then? also does anyone know how morrow is doing after he was subbed off last game?

tfc,2y2fbu,Coramoor_,2,Fri Mar 6 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say Chapman and Aparicio are moreso backups for Giovinco/Osorio and Delgado a backup for Bradley/Cheyrou  Apparently Jackson, Dike, Lovitz and Bloom all didn't make the bench for Vancouver... makes no sense to me but I guess that speaks to the depth we have this year that we didn't last year"
tfc,2y2fbu,Menessy27,2,Fri Mar 6 01:21:12 2015 UTC,"Guys like Aparicio, Chapman and probably Delgado will all spend most of their year with TFC2 once that season kicks off, at least that would be my guess.   I'm surprised by Lovitz and Bloom not making the bench, it's currently a 4-2-3-1 so carrying a guy who only really fits as a Altidore replacement would seem unnecesasry, at least right now. Jackson was barely around in preseason and probably isn't quite ready yet"
tfc,2y2fbu,Coramoor_,2,Fri Mar 6 01:30:50 2015 UTC,I would be surprised if Chapman wasn't a regular first teamer  Apparently TFC will be playing a diamond (at least according to the TFC website preview) which would make sense as to why they're leaving off wingers. Not sure if that's a permanent thing or just a tactical decision based on the opponent and the situation which is a road match vs a team with a strong midfield.
tfc,2y2fbu,Menessy27,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:26:53 2015 UTC,who is he going to play over?
tfc,2y2fbu,Coramoor_,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:29:57 2015 UTC,"At his natural CAM position? Giovinco. Because, you know, that's super likely. Even if Giovinco needs to be subbed off, I think we're more likely to see Warner put in and Osorio shifted up."
tfc,2y2fbu,errboi,1 point,Fri Mar 6 07:21:03 2015 UTC,Chapman? you don't have to play over someone to be a regular first teamer.
tfc,2y2fbu,Menessy27,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:09:20 2015 UTC,"my point is, the guy hasn't played a professional game yet, what is the point of keeping him with the first team when he isn't going to get minutes, call him up if you need him but let him play games with TFC2 and get professional experience first"
tfc,2y2fbu,Coramoor_,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:14:34 2015 UTC,Because he's good enough to play for TFC? why have him on TFC2 when he can help the first team? there's nothing wrong with having him as a sub
tfc,2y2fbu,Menessy27,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:17:13 2015 UTC,"he isn't going to play though, the occasional 15 minutes isn't worth it, both teams still train at the same facility, he'll get the experience anyway and instead of playing 15 games for a grand total of 200 minutes or whatever, he'll get 30 games for 2700 minutes.

tfc,2x8jb7,quelar,9,Thu Feb 26 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"1) Extremely disappointing. Especially considering all the hype and expectation.  2) I'd say between 3rd and 5th. But the cynic in me says 6th, and MLSE will somehow market 6th out of 10 as a success since it means playoffs...  3) I would absolutely hate for it to happen. There is already so little to be proud of with this club, but having our own home is definitely something. Taking that away would be a huge blow.  4) No, don't live in Toronto anymore  5) Both, sort of. He certainly didn't do himself any favours by staying quiet and in England while he was injured during the window, but he did nothing but score goals and be professional on the pitch.   6) The team looks good. I'm concerned about a lack of good wide options, and the injury prone-ness of our centre backs though.  7) Infinity. But it all worked out in the end I guess. Still hurts to see a homegrown player somewhere else though.  8) I worry about the reputation we have as a dysfunctional club.  I feel like eventually it's going to turn players off from wanting to play for us. I really can't stand our owners, they're severely incompetent and I can't shake the feeling that they just want to qualify for the playoffs so they can just gouge us on ticket prices again."
tfc,2x8jb7,jztrumpeter,1 point,Thu Feb 26 15:48:58 2015 UTC,I'd rather see homegrown players elsewhere than not playing at all anymore.
tfc,2x8jb7,errboi,5,Thu Feb 26 16:36:25 2015 UTC,"1)  Obvious disappointment.  From a playoff spot back to being out of the playoffs.  2) The apathy I feel about this team is crazy.  The last time I got really hyped about this team was when Winter came into town, the confidence he showed was super inspiring.  Leiweke's confidence was infectious too, but the fast decline of the team was again very disheartening.  That's why, no matter how many moves we make and money we spend, I have a hard time really getting excited about the team.    That being said, I'll probably always keep my season tickets because shitty soccer is better than no soccer.    3) I'm an Argo season ticket holder as well because... I like sports.  I really wouldn't want them to share stadiums but what else can we do?  As long as ALL the blue Argo colors are gone for the TFC games I think I'll be happy.  No banners, no logos, nothing.  4)  Purchased.  It's basically an occasion to go out with my friends and family and seats in 220 are pretty cheap.  5)  He got hurt, not his fault.  I think the fail is on the TFC management here, and the new ad put out this week is really childish (if it is intended to be aimed at Defoe).  I honestly think management should refund anyone who bought a Defoe or Gilberto jersey.  Obviously you take a gamble anytime you buy a named jersey, but you can't hype up a player as much as you did and then have him walk after a year.   6) I miss Gilberto already, he was the hardest working player on our team last year.  Gonna mention how Urruti, Plata and Laba had fantastic years last year and we gave them up too.   I have 0 faith in Altidore right now, his past few years have been quite awful and there just isn't anything to be excited about.    7) Super sketchy.  How can you not inform the fans that a player has been transferred?   8) MLSE should pay Leweike anything he wants to make him stay.   I suspect Vanney won't survive the entire season, he should have been an interim coach and we should have found a coach with actual experience in the offseason.  Yeah yeah, rotating door of coaches - but I really don't think Vanney is the answer."
tfc,2x8jb7,LightsCameraRegret,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:49:55 2015 UTC,"Curious, why do you want Leiweke to stay so bad? For all the success he's had elsewhere he hasn't accomplished anything here.   He basically threw big bucks at Bradley + Defoe, promised playoffs,  and nothing else from then on.   And depending on how you feel about Nelsen it was Leiweke who decided to keep him."
tfc,2x8jb7,jztrumpeter,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"His attitude and energy mostly.  I think he's a pretty one of a kind guy.  The raptors definitely wouldn't be where they were without him,  BMO field might not have been upgraded and we probably never would have signed Defoe, Bradley, and Giovinco if it wasn't for him dreaming big.  Whoever we replace him with will have big shoes to fill."
tfc,2x8jb7,LightsCameraRegret,5,Fri Feb 27 12:52:18 2015 UTC,"1) Meh  2) Who knows  3) Fargo - Fuck 'em  4) Got my very first season ticket!  5) Mercenary for hire  6) I'm excited about all of the new additions to the squad, both the guys with experience and the guys without.  7) 42  8) Let's just say we were never really a Football Club until recently - I've been seeing big improvements off the pitch every single season for the last couple years.  Mind you there have been some fuck ups too, but it seems we are moving in the right direction for once."
tfc,2x8jb7,warpus,4,Thu Feb 26 16:01:56 2015 UTC,"It's both disappointing and comforting to know that some things don't change. I'm going to experience some real mixed emotions the day TFC actually make the playoffs. 5th, maybe 6th place.  I don't want to see the Argos at BMO field but it's not going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back and causes me to stop supporting TFC. Don't have season tickets as I'm living in the US. If I already lived in Toronto I would be a season ticket holder and would have renewed. If I were to move to Toronto this year I would purchase season tickets as soon as I was able. Definitely not a Judas in my books. When he was fit he scored for fun. I still maintain that the TFC fanbase turned on Defoe way too quickly and are mostly responsible for his post-season exit. I'll miss Henry and Gilberto. Defoe was arguably the best player we've had on the team (only because Frings wasn't still at that level when he came here), and it will be hard to replace the impact he had on the field. I'm not sure Jozy is up to it.  5 I guess? It's not so much sketchy as just mind-boggling. Why not just come out and say he'd been sold when he was sold? I think that if we can pull off a better than 5th place finish this season we'll be okay. We can start to put our reputation as Chivas North (as in a club that's very dysfunctional and poorly managed) behind us a bit and focus on a new era. I've seen very little from the owners and management over the last year to really believe things are that different though, and fully expect to see Vanney handing out resumes before the 2016 season starts even if he does relatively well."
tfc,2x8jb7,errboi,3,Thu Feb 26 16:42:53 2015 UTC,I can sum up my thoughts on TFC in one world...#GonnaWinTheLeague...end of
tfc,2x8jb7,Boethius13,3,Thu Feb 26 14:58:52 2015 UTC,"1) Looking at the big picture we did improve from 2013 to 2014 but the mid/late season implosion really disappointed me. 2) The new additions look good. I am nervous about how the team will play together and if Vanney is able to be the head coach we need. 3) Hate the idea of Argos moving in. They say they it won't affect pitch conditions but I'm skeptical.  4) I wish...living in Calgary 5) He was a hero first but people called him a Judas, then he began to think he was a Judas and eventually became one. 6) Love the new additions. We'll see if Altidore is an improvement on Gilberto....other than that all the new players seem like a good fit for the team. 7) Ha! It was clever in a sneaky gangster sort of way so like a 187? 8) We need to find a stable regime! The one thing I'm tired of is the revolving door of players and coaches especially. It feels like we are a perpetual expansion club still searching for an identity. MLSE needs to show they can make it happen."
tfc,2x8jb7,rickyforr,2,Thu Feb 26 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"1) How do you feel about last years performance?  Last year, after we fired Nelsen, there were games I attended that I literally wanted to walk out on. It was heartbreaking after our strong start to the season.   2) How do you feel we will do this year?  I am cautiously optimistic. The squad looks better and dare I say it, deeper. Unsure about our new coach, but I guess he deserves a shot.   3) What are your thoughts  on a very possible Argo addition at bmo?  Hate it. It will wreck the pitch. It may be the one thing that makes me give up my season tickets.   4) Did you give up, purchase new, or retain your season tickets?  Retained them. I'm in the south end on day 1 prices, so it was a no brainer.   5) Defoe, Judas or misunderstood hero?  He got what he wanted - a chance to make England's World Cup team. He failed.   We got what we wanted - goals.   While Jozy's goal scoring record doesn't compare, the age difference means we could have Jozy for years to come. Defoe was a 2 or 3 player (at best).   6) New and lost team members?  Had high hopes for Bekker. I wish him success with Dallas.   Too bad about Gilberto, he was great for us. Maybe we will find his way back here after the loan is over, if we're lucky.   7) On a scale of 1-infinity  exactly how sketchy was Henry's sale?  Infinity.   8) Overall how do you feel about the health of the club, where it's going, it's owners, etc?  I'm honestly not sure. I know that because we are owned by MLSE and in turn Rogers and Bell, money is never going to be a problem.  But the constant turnover of players and staff needs to stop. Hopefully this is the beginning of that.   On the field, we have a good mix of experience and youth and will hopefully stick around and lead to some on-field success."
tfc,2x8jb7,Northie113,2,Fri Feb 27 00:24:07 2015 UTC,"1) I'll prob be in the minority, but last season was the most fun i'd had at BMO since 2007. Best team we ever fielded. Still in Awe that we even have guys like Bradley on the team. Obviously dissapointed to not be in the play offs... but its not like that was anything new.  2) Barring significant injuries, this has to be a play off team.  3) Not happy. Praying some sort of alternative is reached. Still dunno who Argos can't team up with UofT to make a decent little downtown stadium...  4) Retained.  5) Defoe - Lethal striker. Came for the pay cheque, but delivered when he was healthy. It's too bad he's made of glass... Even just a few more games from him and we'd have snuck into the play offs.  6) Beyond excited for Cheyrou and Perquis. Altidore and Gio may receive all the fan fare, but those two Frenchmen are the types of signings that make or break a team.  7) I don't know why everybody is freaking out over the Henry thing. It's been noted that its extremely hard for a Canadian pass port to get into Europe. Cyrpus allows for a loop hole to get him in there. I'm happy for the guy and im glad we managed to get an extra year out of him before he left.  8) I wish some billionaire would just come and buy TFC. But that's not gunna happen. At least current honchos arnt treating TFC like the redheaded stepchild and are putting cash into it."
tfc,2x8jb7,juanroberto,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:51:56 2015 UTC,"I think people freak out about the Henry thing because the club kept it all hush hush for 90% of the season when they'd already sold him months ago. Then they were all weird and dodgy about it, with the brand new head coach supposedly not even knowing which club the player had been sold to."
tfc,2x8jb7,errboi,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:56:56 2015 UTC,"I like it better this way. With the way Toronto media covers these teams it would have been a ridiculous story line all year.  Every time Henry would make a mistake, it woudn't just be a simple mistake it would be because he's already looking past Toronto to his future in Europe. ""Oh he doesn't want to be here anyway! He's leaving! His head's not in the game"""
tfc,2x8jb7,juanroberto,2,Fri Feb 27 12:32:28 2015 UTC,1) Really disappointing. Didn't think they'd go far in the playoffs but I thought they'd at least make them. Really didn't have much faith in Nelsen 2) Playoffs 3) If it doesn't hurt the pitch and there's no blue on matchday I don't care. Doubt that'll happen though. 4) My buddies have season tickets and I go when one of them can't 5) There's plenty of blame to go around. The whole QPR thing was mishandled and after that there was no way he was coming back. 6) Hoping for a fourth DP and a recall of Gilberto from loan (if that's possible) Other than that Laba and Plata. 7) 3/4 infinity 8) I'm still worried about the front office. Have never heard good things about what goes on behind the scenes. Also the whole Caldwell-Bradley-captaincy thing was weird. I'll hopefully feel more optimistic when I see them on the field.
tfc,2x8jb7,ThePostmaster22,2,Fri Feb 27 03:54:49 2015 UTC,"1) Last year was oversold and underdelivered. I think we had a top-calibre team, but we were riddled with injuries and locker room issues that kept the squad out of the playoffs. They had all the tools to make it, they just messed up.  2) Dedication is there for sure, as is the skill. Giovinco is a huge signing for TFC and the league. I think that this is the year, honestly. We have a better squad than last year, having upgraded more than just our DPs. We're more balanced everywhere, and when you listen to the guys talk you can hear excitement and dedication. I think we have one of the top 5 squads in the league on paper, and I think we'll finish in the Top 4 in the East.  3) I'm an out of town fan so I'm not particularly familiar with other Toronto sports teams and their management, but my general feeling is that sharing with a football team will lead to hassles I'd prefer not to have.  4) Not a season ticket holder, but I convinced my parents (who moved to TO in 2013) to purchase season tickets last year. They went from never watching or caring about soccer to being incredibly dedicated fans. We talk about the team all the time. My mom might leave my dad for Michael Bradley. My dad sits around the house streaming pre-season games. They've renewed.  5) Fans made the situation far, far worse than it should have been, and if he had any doubts at all we certainly pushed him away instead of tried to get him to stay. Considering how good he was when he had fan support, I think the whole thing was handled poorly. Defoe certainly has some blame, but I think the fans acted like children and Defoe said ""fuck that noise.""  6) Gilberto is the one I'm sad about. Not sure if Altidore will be better. Seems like a side-grade, and I loved Gil. Cheyrou and Perquis both seem like huge additions. Squad is all around improved.  EDIT: Oh and somehow I forgot about Henry, who I also loved and had intended to pick up his jersey this year. I think he has a huge amount of potential, and I think we could see him make a triumphant return to BMO in 5 or 6 years if we want him back. I love the guy. See below.  7) How many zeros in infinity? Seriously though, I'm pumped for him. I'm a huge fan and I've always defended him, I think he has the potential to be the best defender Canada has. Can't wait to watch him in the Gold Cup.  8) I love Bez, I think that since he has come in our roster has improved very, very notably. He knows what he's doing, and now we just need the on-field performance to catch up. Vanney worries me, he has a mind for the game no doubt but he isn't proven yet. He could be great, or he could be a flop. I really hope this is the year. I think it is. But I said that last year too."
tfc,2x8jb7,EasterlyFan,2,Fri Feb 27 12:53:08 2015 UTC,"1) How do you feel about last years performance? Too much hype. Could we have made the playoffs last season? Yes, we had the potential, but we were affected by the injury bug just like the Jays were last season.  2) How do you feel we will do this year?  I would say somewhere between 4th and 6th, afterall 6th place gets into the playoffs now. Its definitely to early to say but I think we have an awesome team this year with the new additions. As  long as the team doesnt suffer from too many injurys this season, we will be playoff bound for sure.  3) What are your thoughts on a very possible Argo addition at bmo? Hell No, CFL is a farce and The argos can go play at varsity stadium.  4) Did you give up, purchase new, or retain your season tickets? Too expensive for seasons tickits , went to a couple of games last season. For sure going to go to more this season.  5) Defoe, Judas or misunderstood hero? As a Man United fan, never really liked Defoe since he played for the spurs. I do respect that he is a lethal striker though when he has proper service. As I said wasnt a huge fan of him with the spurs and that didnt change when he came to T.O. I honestly hope Sunderland get relegated this season.  6) New and lost team members? Cheyrou and Perquis will be amazing signings. Can't wait to see Perquis and Caldy in anchoring the back four. Good for the young defenders too to have players with experience like that to help them develop. Jozy: not sure about him after his recent stint in the EPL only scoring 1 goal. Seba, really excited to see him play for toronto. He was a massive signing for the MLS not just Toronto. Benoit and Bradley look good together so far in mid. I can honestly say I was sad to see Gil leave, even if its on loan. I dont see him returning as he is pissed off with management. I wouldnt blame him, gets signed as a DP next season he gets replaced with another DP.   7) On a scale of 1-infinity exactly how sketchy was Henry's sale?  It was sketchy, but I'm proud Henrys made it to Europe, even if it is West Ham, I can see him becoming one of Canadas top defenders.  8) Overall how do you feel about the health of the club, where it's going, it's owners, etc? After last season theres no way but up...  And the atmosphere at BMO was horrendous last year hopefully it improves. Vanney- Not sure about him, Think Bez shouldve given Ryan at least till the end of the season... He managed to get us in 3rd place then gets fired, thats where it all went down hill."
tfc,2x8jb7,TFC43,4,Fri Feb 27 14:49:18 2015 UTC,"A letdown overall but the optimist in me at least recognises that it was better than the year before. SURELY we are play-off bound this year!  Can't stand American Football but it seems somewhat inevitable. Just hope there is minimal impact on the match day experience for the Reds. Retained half a pair with one person and half a pair with another. They have both been SSH since day one so it costs me a fraction of what it would for me to get my own pair as a new SSH. He would only be a Judas if he went to Montreal. I'm on the fence. Excited to see how the new additions play out but very disappointed to see Gilberto go. 69. As long as we have big money behind us, we'll be fine.  My biggest concern is the club not doing enough to attract new fans/SSH.  The price difference between renewing and new seasons is insane."
tfc,2x8jb7,discostu81,2,Thu Feb 26 16:25:01 2015 UTC,"1) How do you feel about last years performance? I feel as though my expectations were tempered to begin with, but I am still disappointed that we went through such a traumatic shake up at the point in the season we did, where we were sitting in a playoff position. Nelson was really in over his head for sure. His style was completely stone-aged, but I think Bez showed his inexperience by not being a little more diplomatic and trying his best to wait until the season was over.  2) How do you feel we will do this year? Sigh, who knows? I want to believe. This team on paper is spectacular. Can they avoid injuries, can they play together as a unit? Will Gio's talents be maximized? Will Bradley be pushed out of role time and time again? Not having to rely on teenage Centre Backs to carry such a heavy load is a good thing, surely. A more modern and elegant set of tactics from Vanney is hopefully a good thing.  3) What are your thoughts on a very possible Argo addition at bmo? Hate it. Fuck off, Argos.  4) Did you give up, purchase new, or retain your season tickets? Unfortunately moving up to Thunder Bay for school this year, so no ST for this guy. I will definitely try to get to BMO once or twice when home though.  5) Defoe, Judas or misunderstood hero? World-class quality poacher with talents the likes we'd never seen. Put the ball in the back of the net nearly effortlessly when healthy and playing. Thrilling to watch. Of course, he checked out immediately when he was snubbed for WC, and was only ever really a merc. I'm not sure I thought he could be more anyway, definitely never expected him to 'bleed red' or anything. I am displeased but not surprised with how he was quickly bumrushed out of town in typical Toronto sports media/fan fashion.  6) New and lost team members? Terrific new additions. Very excited to see them in real action. I want to see some tricky Euro playmaking, and rock solid experienced defending. So sad to see Henry go. I felt like I was one of the only people who stood by him when he was thrust into that back line last year. Through the brutal errors and brilliant flashes I felt like he was special. I guess West Ham did too.  7) On a scale of 1-infinity exactly how sketchy was Henry's sale? Infinity. I hate this aspect of MLS, but such is life. My worst fear is that this happens again this year. I had a nightmare weeks ago where Justin Morrow had actually signed with Werder Bremen while he was over there and was secretly on loan with us for this season. I want transparency!  8) Overall how do you feel about the health of the club, where it's going, it's owners, etc? As with anything, the ""health"", or more appropriately the ""wealth"" of the club is never in question. MLSE have buckets of cash, and people in Toronto love soccer. We're also the dumbest fucking sports fans in the world, and all it takes is a brand new carrot every season to string us along for another ride. Even if we tank again this season the excuses will placate all but the most furious fans and we'll fire up the hype train again next season! Where we're going? I need to see more. I need to see Vanney in action for an entire season. I need to see what happens without Lieweke (who is a shameful cunt for dipping out so early). I need to see if Bez is actually the one pulling the strings to make these wonder signings happen. I need to see Bradley step up and be the guy we all think he is. I need to see TFC II work, and be an asset. I need some goddamn playoffs.  EDIT - Thanks for doing this btw, your hard work in this sub is always appreciated."
tfc,2x8jb7,buddychiefpal,2,Thu Feb 26 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"1) Very disappointing but an important stepping stone to what were building now from those mistakes.  2) We'll make Playoffs at least. I have faith in the pieces we brought in this off season.  3) Absolutely against it in every way, shape, and form.  4) No season tix this year, hopefully for next season.  5) A bit of both. The guy performed theres no questioning that, but the drama he produced and the way it was handled could have been managed better. The media and fans didn't help the situation either. I'm just glad to put it behind us.   6) Besides not being able to keep Goalberto I'm excited to see this team play.   7) ∞. The whole thing was weird  8) I think we've had some growing pains but the club is learning and has improved much over the past few seasons regardless of our shortcomings. I feel good about our future and I'm happy with how management is running things for the most part. All we gotta do now is make the playoffs."
tfc,2x8jb7,Kim_Jong_Unchained,2,Thu Feb 26 17:11:01 2015 UTC,"1) Poor, should have made the playoffs even with our bloody big deal missing half the games.   2) This team has potential to be very good and get far in the playoffs but should we even be surprised if we don't make the playoffs?   3) boourns   4) can't afford them but i'll be going to 2 or 3 games.  5) my hype level was so high after he scored those quick two goals against Seattle and i thought he'd be scoring hat tricks every game and shit. Too bad he didn't score for the last 4 months.   6) I think the team improved in every position with the 4 big signings, just missing a good winger.   7) 11   8) They seem to be making an effort at least, I like what leiweke has done"
tfc,2x8jb7,Bdog5,2,Thu Feb 26 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"1) It was the best we've ever done, and we wouldv'e made the playoffs if we'd kept our coach  2) Same, midtable just below playoffs  3) Argos and CFL is trash (edit: something that doesn't interest me), I have no interest in watching either football or soccer played on a football field  4) Never bought 'em. Probably won't buy a single ticket this year if the field is mucked from the Argo expansion  5) Defoe did great for us. You can't just wish away an injury. Don't blame him for leaving this shitshow either  6) Loaning away Thrillberto was a good move. Otherwise I don't care, we can make all sorts of formations around Bradley who is pure class  7) I have to feel like with these hush-hush deals, there's always an unspoken element of building alliances behind the scenes. Any relationship we can have with European clubs will in theory be beneficial  8) Look at how much changeover we've had in every position besides management. It's easy to maintain their position when the media (that they also own) passes the buck on to coaches and players. I strongly feel that we could bring back ANY iteration of TFC in the last 5 years with new, better management and make the playoffs."
tfc,2x8jb7,Joao_Platypus,1 point,Thu Feb 26 18:39:11 2015 UTC,"Obviously, like everyone else, I was disappointed that we could not make the playoffs. However, I thought last season was a step in the right direction for what the ambition of this club should be. Toronto FC has the financial resources to not only field a team that can win the league, but attract international stars and help establish MLS as a top league. We need to strive to be that, and the club has shown a commitment to that goal. This is Toronto FC, so the playoffs are far from guaranteed, but I am very optimistic about the strength of our club on paper. I like the additions/subtractions we've made, we look to be much stronger up the middle of the park. But none of it matters unless they can go out and produce. It's up to them now to prove us wrong, and go secure a playoff spot. I'm not sure I could handle another season of failure, with this lineup. FUCK THE ARGOS. The CFL is a joke. I don't have season tickets, I just wasn't in a position to afford them this year, but I plan on attending at least half the home games. A bit of both. I thought he was a good player for our club, but he didn't represent us well off the field. The media didn't drive him out of town, he just didn't want to be here. I have no time for that as a fan. Why should I support you if you so clearly don't want to play here? Leiweke's comments were exactly how I saw it. I'm glad it's over and we can move on. I think the additions were all positives. Giovinco promises to be a franchise player, Jozy hopes to regain his form, but I think a big addition not enough people are talking about is Cheyrou. I expect him to form a strong partnership with Bradley and help establish us as a strong, stable defensive team. The subtraction of Defoe is an addition in it’s own right. I hope full public disclosure regarding player transactions becomes a reality with MLS. It would go a long way to improving the reputation of the league. I don’t think things have ever looked brighter for TFC. I cannot wait for the start of the season, and I expect to finally enter the BMO field gates come November for that first playoff game."
tfc,2x8jb7,R00K416,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:31:14 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen online, everyone is saying Cheyrou is a player not enough people are talking about, but if everyone is saying it then there are probably enough people talking about him. It's like Justin Mapp: Everyone says he's an underrated winger, but if everyone is saying it then he's probably not really underrated anymore."
tfc,2x8jb7,errboi,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:54:26 2015 UTC,"You see, the problem is, too many people are talking about not enough people talking about him.  Really though, I'm very impressed with Cheyrou and his skill level is quite evident from only a few opportunities to watch him thus far."

Better than given credit for (we improved 12 points and were in mix before injuries), but worse than talent should have put us (last two months were....bad)  2) How do you feel we will do this year?  Honestly? The team should compete to win the East. Yeah,  I know...history, but... I say 3rd and a playoff win.  3) What are your thoughts on a very possible Argo addition at bmo?  That we should all gather in the Go Tunnel before Argos games and go all Millwall?   4) Did you give up, purchase new, or retain your season tickets?  I kept all three. Hooligans use them. I sneak in through a little trick I have by Gate 1.  5) Defoe, Judas or misunderstood hero?  I'll take ""Words that rhyme with bunt,"" Alex!  6) New and lost team members?  Still miss Mista.  7) On a scale of 1-infinity exactly how sketchy was Henry's sale?  It was very MLS. Lets go 500.  8) Overall how do you feel about the health of the club, where it's going, it's owners, etc?  I actually think Bez knows what he's doing. I also have substance issues so, you know...  Fill in the blanks.  Pickle."
tfc,2x8jb7,Agueroooooooooo,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:04:16 2015 UTC,"1) Disappointed that TFC once again missed the playoffs. Also felt burnt out by the coaching change, back room drama, etc.  2) I want to say playoffs, between 3rd - 6th, but knowing TFC, there will be some distraction or implosion that will deny TFC playoffs.  3) As a supporter, don't like it, but it makes the most sense business-wise. Argos at BMO will damage, and possibly even kill off TFC, depending on the reaction of the supporters. It is dangerous.  4) Purchased a season ticket for the first time.  5) Won't go so far to call him a Judas, but he has displayed mercenary-like behavior. Amazing when he played, but let's face it. He was only here to pad his stats in the hopes of getting an England call-up, and when that didn't happen, he basically mailed it in.  6) New additions look solid, though it is always a bit of a gamble when going for players outside the continent rather than tried and tested MLS players. Still think they have depth issues, especially in the back with their unproven draft picks, also need some options on the wings to vary up play.  7) When I first heard of it, definitely infinity. But when I learned that he went to Cyprus as an easier means to work in the UK, and that TFC still received a fee (sell-on clause), then it made more sense.  8) The club will always be healthy financially, but I am still worried about the ineptitude of the FO. I don't have confidence in Vanney as a coach, but I will credit Bez for coming in with some sort of plan for the club. Another thing I am worried about is the atmosphere and experience at BMO Field. There is much more of an emphasis on marketing and sponsorships than actually creating an authentic atmosphere at BMO Field. I don't like it, and it needs to change. I'll be brutally honest. From going to matches last year, the atmosphere hasn't been good. There needs to be efforts to make BMO Field, once again, an intimidating place to play in, and in my opinion, the FO haven't done anything to facilitate that."

tfc,2x8rg6,BanksKnowsBest,4,Thu Feb 26 16:04:47 2015 UTC,"How can Creavalle possibly be ahead of Bloom in the depth chart? It absolutely boggles my mind. Bloom has proven he's a consistent, reliable fullback. Creavalle admits he's still learning the position and would have looked lost and out of place on a USL PRO team last season when he filled in at RB."
tfc,2x8rg6,errboi,5,Thu Feb 26 18:53:39 2015 UTC,"Listing Luke Moore as a backup for Giovinco tells me that the author either doesn't know much about what sort of player Giovinco is or what sort of player Moore is.  I also sort of expect Bloom to start.  It's his natural position, why slot in someone who, while versatile, is used to playing elsewhere?"
tfc,2x8rg6,warpus,3,Thu Feb 26 20:00:04 2015 UTC,If you've been watching the games Moore has been the sub in Giovinco's position every time playing behind Dike.

tfc,2x8rg6,warpus,3,Thu Feb 26 20:39:26 2015 UTC,Yeah Moore is probably out best striker in terms of dropping back and linking up play. 90% of the game he'll look like he's doing nothing (because he probably is doing nothing) but when he gets the ball he's at least been pretty good about finding the feet of a teammate in a more advanced position.

Granted the writer doesnt want to say ""Give me more free shit for letting us down"" and instead covers it with suggestions of what he would want.  Honestly, the only thing I want from our TFC, is to win. I dont need a supporters pub right there, (It would be nice but I dont care, I'll walk whereever) I dont care where the visitors sit, I am paying attention to our boys and our voices.   All they have to do to keep me as a fan is show they want to win every game, and are not giving up or making excuses. Be hungry for it and show it so I can feel it every game i go to.  Thats all.

tfc,2wujpe,Swervitu,7,Mon Feb 23 06:44:20 2015 UTC,"Findley, Lovitz are battling for LW. Osorio/Jackson on right. At least that's word from camp."
tfc,2wujpe,a_lumberjack,4,Mon Feb 23 14:24:11 2015 UTC,"I liked the look of Findley, but I thought he played on the right in one of the 2 preseason games so far?  Or maybe I was looking at the feed upside down, who knows.  Who is our backup for Giovinco?  We can't have Osorio covering 2 positions without another player being there in the mix as well.  I mean, we can, but it does seem like we are a bit short staffed..  unless I'm forgetting who else could play that attacking midfield/behind Altidore position well enough."
tfc,2wujpe,warpus,4,Mon Feb 23 14:52:09 2015 UTC,"Bradley or Chapman could play further forward, we could play two up top, we can play more of a 4-3-3 with Cheyrou holding and Bradley/Chapman bombing forward from deep.  There's an immense amount of flexibility and depth in place now."
tfc,2wujpe,a_lumberjack,3,Mon Feb 23 14:58:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like our depth for the most part, but I would be against us changing formations if a key player is out - instead we should have good backups for them so that our shape and playing style doesn't have to change to such a degree when an important player is out.  We have a lot of new guys this year, they need to get used to playing with eachother under specific formations - I think it would be detrimental to have to switch to a different formation if Giovinco got injured or needs to be rested.  Chapman seems very promising though, you're right."
tfc,2wujpe,warpus,5,Mon Feb 23 15:16:27 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's not about formation as it's about system.  The delta between 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1, 4-4-1-1, 4-1-4-1, and 4-3-3 is all largely academic if you've got good movement.  All of those end up with four central players and two wingers, with variations on verticality.  I think it's safe to say we'll play with one striker as a linchpin, two wingers (one likely inverted), and three other central players.  Within that, there will be flexibility from game to game, and possibly situation to situation."
tfc,2wujpe,a_lumberjack,4,Mon Feb 23 18:10:53 2015 UTC,"You do have a point there, but Giovinco is such an important part of our system, that if you remove him and don't replace him with an attacking midfielder/playmaker..  we are going to have to change the system to accommodate the changes.  And the key is (I think) to have a ""way of playing"" that doesn't rely on a this player or that player from being present - meaning we need to have good backups for all roles, if not all positions.  So getting back to Osorio - if he is the backup for a wide player (or a starting wide player), who is the backup for Giovinco's role?  Without that role there, we change the system we play under, even if the formation looks reasonably similar.  Even if you move Bradley up in that scenario you are changing roles - in more place than one."
tfc,2wujpe,warpus,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:16:59 2015 UTC,"I think no player is a true like for like in this squad.  Giovinco's skill set simply isn't present in anyone else, so if he's out the tactics will shift.  To be fair, I would expect that tactics will shift within an overall framework on a match to match basis.  Playing RSL away? Push Giovinco to the left, drop Osorio for Chapman or Warner to match the three mids and play on the counter.  Resting Gio?  Bring in Chapman as a somewhat deeper playmaker and exploit Findley's pace on the wing.  Or bring in Warner to sit behind Cheyrou and Bradley so one or both can push forward.  Trailing late with 9 in the box?  Shift Gio left, bring on Moore and use his aerial ability to create second balls for Gio/Jozy.  The system is ""three or four attackers using width and pace to create space, with two central mids controlling/joining the attack, and some overlaps from the fullbacks"" at the core.  Dropping a #10 for a holder is fine on the counter. Otherwise it's basically ""a little deeper"" or ""a little further forward"" for that fourth attacker."

tfc,2wujpe,a_lumberjack,1 point,Mon Feb 23 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"I would expect that tactics will shift within an overall framework on a match to match basis.   Yeah, Vanney seems to be competent enough to do this - also to have a different shape going forward, defending, etc.  I realize that nobody who have is going to be able to match some of Giovinco's abilities, but I think it would just be better if we didn't have a player covering two positions, unless he's a bit of utility player like Creaville maybe.  What I'm afraid of, a bit, is that our players don't have time to get ""their style of playing"" down.  A lot of these guys are new, so it's going to take time for everybody to play the way they want to play - and to be on the same page.  Our squad seems versatile, and that's good, but changing formations and tactics could be detrimental to team chemistry, at least in the first couple weeks or months.  I understand that you usually play a different way depending on who you play anyway - and whether you're attacking or defending, but aside from that you want to have a strategy/formation everyone is familiar with.  We suffered a bit for similar reasons a couple seasons ago when Frings was gone - we didn't have a player to replace his role, so we had to screw with our entire approach to the game.  The team was used to playing with Frings in that role, and so it threw them off their game, IMO.  Our squad seems stronger and much more versatile now, but like I said a lot of the guys are new and I think we need that stability.  If Gio is out, I'd prefer to be able to stick a different player in that role - rather than changing our approach to the game.  I don't know much about Chapman tbh, but he could be that missing piece..  sort of.  Obviously he's going to be nowhere near Giovinco's abilities, but having 2 players to cover 2 positions is better than 1."
tfc,2wujpe,warpus,1 point,Mon Feb 23 20:54:43 2015 UTC,"Has Findley every really played out wide before camp? From what I've seen he looks alright, but not great.  Lovitz is alright, but is still inexperienced and lacks end product.  Whether that be a good cross, or linking up with the midfield or striker.  Osorio is good, but he's not really a true winger.  Either he'll be shut down by the opposing fullback easily or will make us too narrow by tucking in all the time.  Jackson is fine as well, but he doesn't really offer much offensively.   I guess what I'm getting at is that we kind of lack an experienced, consistent, and explosive option out wide (assuming we keep Giovinco in the middle)"
tfc,2wujpe,jztrumpeter,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:24:41 2015 UTC,Yes... 100%  unless findley really becomes amazing at that roll or jackson learns how to finish/pass we need a good attacking winger........this is where a 4th DP would do amazing for us since gilberto will be gone if the new cba includes one theres many good wingers available in europe... VARELA being one we could possibly get since parma is done and he didnt really have a good time in the epl at the start of the season.. his options are either to return to Porto or possibily a new serie a team.. mls might just become enticing to him
tfc,2wujpe,StJohnsFog,3,Mon Feb 23 23:34:48 2015 UTC,"I figured it'd be Findley / Lovitz / Jackson battling for the Right. Also, is Creavalle really a lock right now to replace Bloom? I hate that."

tfc,2wujpe,a_lumberjack,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:32:26 2015 UTC,"Bloom's also looked overwhelmed plenty of times. Ends up way out of position and can't recover, or loses the LW for a goal, far too many times.  Creavalle is much younger and may have more upside."
tfc,2wujpe,notdarren,1 point,Mon Feb 23 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"I think Creavalle and Bloom both have strengths and weaknesses.  One of Bloom's biggest I would say is him getting up the field and not being able to get back.  But I also think Bloom has more to offer than Creavalle up front.    I think one of Creavalle's biggest weakness is when he IS back, he doesn't play with the rest of the defence as well, and ends up out of position letting someone onside when they should have been off.  But he is also better at being a midfielder, so when they ball is in that area, he is very strong.     Creavalle isn't supposed to be a fullback if I recall correctly.  Wiki says Defensive Midfielder, and WhoScored says he can play both."

He seemed pretty agile with really good technique and might be good as atleast a CM who can attack with long shots and passes.. his long shots are actually amazing atleast free kick wise... same with long passes, if he plays deep I think we should utilize fast wingers, someone like oduro would of been perfect to play along cheyrou sitting deep but I really think he can be a force to reckon with in the mls as a attacking mid.. who knows well see, he did impress me with really good ball controll.. also Perquas , whoa talent wise he can turn out to be the best defender in the mls"
tfc,2wo2l4,Swervitu,1 point,Sun Feb 22 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"I expect that with Cheyrou and Bradley both playing the DM kinda role in a 4-2-3-1 (at least from what I've been able to gather, haven't been able to watch much preseason so far) Cheyrou and Bradley will probably alternate going forward and staying back. That will probably give him a decent amount of involvement in the attack and allow him to get a few long range shots off if that is indeed part of his repertoire."

The 2nd half of the season, there was general disgust with TFC.  Defoe was a bigger target - but I doubt any TFC player felt loved at that point.  It's not surprising that Gilberto didn't feel appreciated by the fans.  There was never really a moment where he was scoring and contributing, and the fans were really behind TFC."
tfc,2wk60x,dejour,8,Fri Feb 20 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"I liked Gilberto's work ethic but if the goal is to win a championship, we needed an upgrade over him.

tfc,2wjusd,dejour,3,Fri Feb 20 16:27:21 2015 UTC,"To me, it depends on the level of commitment.  I don't see Altidore as an upgrade (and he's being paid like a huge upgrade).  However, I just want talented players on the team that are committed to TFC and delivering several winning seasons.  Players who want to be here, and believe TFC can be salvaged.  I don't really know how committed the two players are, though I have read some speculation.  I'm okay with the roster shuffle because I'm assuming that Altidore is more committed than Gilberto.  Maybe that's not accurate though."

For full disclosure, I am not super familiar with Altidore, but from my understanding he prefers to lead the line..  while Gilberto likes to play behind a striker, in a supporting role.  I could have that completely wrong, my basement just got flooded and I'm drinking vodka.  But I think I'm right enough.  Either way, if I'm right you can't really think of one player being an upgrade over the other - if they excel/prefer to play in different roles.  Giovinco looks to be the ""playing behind the leading striker"" guy - essentially taking over Gilberto's role.  Sort of.  Not quite.  Back to the vodka for me.  Cheers."

tfc,2whml1,TheDarkRedKnight,3,Fri Feb 20 01:23:45 2015 UTC,"Bad joke haha, how Marlies win while Leafs perennially suck."
tfc,2whml1,nazthetech,2,Fri Feb 20 01:25:23 2015 UTC,TFC Academy did so well in League1 Ontario last year that MLSE asked for permission to pull them from the league and enter them into PDL. USL should be much more competitive though.
tfc,2whml1,TheDarkRedKnight,2,Fri Feb 20 04:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think League1 Ontario is a proper test. If we crush USL, it'd be even nicer."
tfc,2whml1,errboi,4,Fri Feb 20 05:11:05 2015 UTC,"Should be fun to watch. They've got a pretty nice system going with TFC in MLS, TFC2 in USL, TFC Senior Academy in PDL and TFC Academy U18s in League1 Ontario."
tfc,2whml1,TheDarkRedKnight,1 point,Fri Feb 20 05:31:44 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it's only permission for the coming year, after which they've been told they can't have a PDL team. I'm not sure whether they can appeal it."
tfc,2whml1,errboi,1 point,Fri Feb 20 05:57:29 2015 UTC,"I can see the OSA's point of view, they want to strengthen our own leagues, not those of the USSF. It's just unfortunate that ours are still in the early stages when TFC is looking for something more competitive."
tfc,2whml1,TheDarkRedKnight,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:02:58 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with the OSA if TFC was pulling their L10 team completely. As it is, they're pulling the senior academy team out of L10 and putting a younger one in. From what I've been told, that younger team is still expected to be one of the top teams in the league, so it's not like TFC isn't committed to growing soccer in Canada as well."

tfc,2wdh8w,iamthelight_,6,Thu Feb 19 00:39:47 2015 UTC,I have to give credit to the 10's of people that showed up tonight that aren't directly involved in the team.  Like all 20 of them.
tfc,2wdh8w,quelar,5,Thu Feb 19 01:32:17 2015 UTC,That's so TFC.
tfc,2wdh8w,denMAR,11,Thu Feb 19 01:55:53 2015 UTC,Unsure what you mean. The goal against by a many level lower team? The missed penalty kick? The wholesale changes that don't improve the team?  Or is it that you're watching TFC on a wednesday night and wondering how drunk you might get?
tfc,2wdh8w,quelar,3,Thu Feb 19 02:04:35 2015 UTC,I refuse to let TFC drive me to the bottle over a preseason game. I'm going to just be glad my local USL PRO team got the win tonight.

tfc,2wdh8w,CompletelyUnbaised,5,Thu Feb 19 00:31:31 2015 UTC,Jozy and Giovinco look hilarious playing next to each other!
tfc,2wdh8w,ostrichman1,4,Thu Feb 19 00:52:44 2015 UTC,"Perquis and Bradley seem to have some chemistry already, I hope this continues."
tfc,2wdh8w,quelar,4,Thu Feb 19 01:18:20 2015 UTC,Cheryou was very impressive. Giovinco needs to keep things a little more simple.
tfc,2wdh8w,CompletelyUnbaised,5,Thu Feb 19 01:26:08 2015 UTC,"Dike man.... he is a great backup, very excited about having him on our team and playing again."
tfc,2wdh8w,quelar,3,Thu Feb 19 02:09:23 2015 UTC,Stream keeps crashing for me
tfc,2wdh8w,CompletelyUnbaised,3,Thu Feb 19 01:16:08 2015 UTC,"Cheyrou and Bradley working great together in the midfield, the two best players on the pitch at the moment if you ask me... attack is non existent however, Giovinco holding the ball for much too long every time he has gotten it thus far. Fingers crossed for a goal in the second half, would be disappointing if our attack can't get it together to at least put one against OKC Energy."
tfc,2wdh8w,Jedimindtrixxx,1 point,Thu Feb 19 01:28:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, our attacking players need more playing time together it seems.  This is ""just preseason"" and ""the score doesn't really matter"", but having said that we should have at least had a goal or two."
tfc,2wdh8w,warpus,3,Thu Feb 19 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"I actually thought we played pretty well especially. Dominated the game in terms of possession, shots and corners but just lacked that cutting edge in the final 3rd. I can't talk about the goal because I looked away for 2 seconds and missed it and there were no replays on the broadcast. But either way I can't say anyone played poorly or anything, Moore's penalty miss was bad but he was still decent. It's nice to see we finally have a team that can dominate possession, rather than a team that sucked but tried to and failed (i.e. Winter's team)  Top 5 pleasant surprises for me:   Perquis - Strong in the air, faster than I expected, good passer, directed players where to go, just looked really good in general, had a header cleared off the line Lovitz - looked really active playing on the right which he hasn't played for us before. He might not be playing there with Jackson back but I liked his game there Chapman - he looks really good for his age, the ball sticks to his feet and he's also pretty aggressive defensively. At one point he just picked up the ball and easily walked through 3 defenders right to the edge of the box. He reminds me of Osorio and I think he could be better than him Creavalle - I liked him at right back. He looked better than he did there last season especially going forward and his cross drew the penalty Dike - Looked a lot quicker and more dynamic than he did last season. I don't think he was at his best coming off the ACL injury but the offseason looks like it helped"
tfc,2wdh8w,Menessy27,6,Thu Feb 19 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"Just in case we get a slew of mouth breathers here I'd just like to say that many of the pieces on the field played well and some of our early pairings did well together.   The result does not matter today, it matters when we play a league or cup game."
tfc,2wdh8w,quelar,2,Thu Feb 19 02:31:24 2015 UTC,Predictions? I'm gonna guess a 4-1 win for us.
tfc,2wdh8w,Soldado4lyf,8,Thu Feb 19 00:33:19 2015 UTC,Now we just gotta score 4 yea?

tfc,2wdh8w,quelar,2,Thu Feb 19 02:28:35 2015 UTC,Pretty decent first half.  It's hard to tell if Perquis is really that comfortable playing the ball or if the lack of pressure from OKC is making him look so calm.

tfc,2w51x5,iamthelight_,4,Tue Feb 17 01:50:32 2015 UTC,Agreed.   Going from playing your first play off game and winning a final is years of experience and chemistry our team doesn't have. These are very generous odds.

tfc,2w5mbh,Hieberrr,2,Tue Feb 17 05:24:14 2015 UTC,"Given that they're building new gates (at least one at the SW corner), I'm starting to hope that they're moving BMO to a membership card system.  No tickets, just membership cards like a bunch of clubs already have.  No more need to produce half a million unique tickets.  No more lost tickets.  The super smart next step is to then implement a permanent club membership card for something minimal, call it $20 (credited for buying your first match ticket), which can be used by any member to access TicketExchange and buy regular tickets, or be given tickets by a friend.  And then, if you're really bold: allow use of that card as a tap-to-pay card at all BMO Field locations (including club store).  Discounts auto-apply  Why it wins for us: * Better experience as a ticket holder (a wallet card is all I need to get into the stadium and to buy food/drinks) * Easier sharing of tickets (great for SSH who can't make all games) * Makes it harder for scalpers to operate (screw those guys) * The ownership gets to see which groups of fans are most or least engaged, and work on improving those aspects   Why it wins for the club: * Saves money on dealing with paper and counterfeits. * Gives the club a much more accurate picture of how their supporters interact with the game day experience (when do they get there, what do they spend and on what) to figure out how to improve that experience * Tap to pay leads to more sales  God, I've become such a corporate whore."

tfc,2vzvk3,errboi,3,Sun Feb 15 19:28:16 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he's not coming back. If he performs at Vasco they can exercise the buy clause in the loan deal and if he doesn't then we'll look for another buyer when the deal is up and we aren't in a position where the cap rules require us to move him.

tfc,2vzvk3,Captain_Crank,1 point,Tue Feb 17 16:59:41 2015 UTC,Good point I forgot he used to play for Portuguesa.

tfc,2vrjw8,sfw84,2,Fri Feb 13 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"True, but they are a 7 year old program competing against brand new teams. A temporary move to PDL makes sense, but the quality of L1O will come and we should be supportung the move to a Canadian structure"

I'm hoping to see the less corrupt CSL teams eventually defect  (it'd be sad to lose some of the history) and PDL teams (a Canadian league that serves our interests vs an American league that uses us for cash to buoy the great lakes region).  Even if it's our 4th tier, I believe it is a key step"
tfc,2vrjw8,KSenCSmith,1 point,Fri Feb 13 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"They will still be entering a younger team from the academy into L10. It doesn't do anyone any good for TFC to outclass everyone. TFC doesn't benefit from it, and the teams getting stomped don't really gain very much if anything either."

I went to a Raptors game last week and marvelled at how at every stoppage of play something else starts (and sometimes doesn't stop even when play has resumed). I imagine the trouble at MLSE is that they have some of the same people doing both TFC and Raptors. And they start thinking the TFC game day experience should be like the Raptors game day experience.

I think mascots are a good face of the team for kids, especially in outreach programs like Sick Kids or maybe various soccer clinics and other events (CNE). However, if the mascots meant to fire up the crowd with a t-shirt gun, than I'd rather MLSE engage their supporter groups for more excitement.  Either way, a mascot's not the sanitization of BMO field. Mascots are pretty common for all the BPL teams probably Champions league as well."

We'll play Vancouver and will more than likely be featured on one of the TSN stations. Technically friendlies don't count as a debut and he hasn't even joined up with the team yet.

Ultimately, all that matters is that he delivers on the field and he does what he is paid to do.  Also, what's with the whole line about MLS being his ""rebound girlfriend""? The guy just said that he wanted to be in a team where he was appreciated. Nothing wrong with that and no need to interpreted as something negative.

He just went on and on and on about it like it was the most horrendous thing ever.

He's already played on a number of our national teams (U18, U20, etc), so I have no doubt he will be ready for the senior team if he keeps maturing.

tfc,2uo1ej,Kim_Jong_Unchained,2,Tue Feb 3 19:22:05 2015 UTC,"Some Gilberto stuff in the last couple paragraphs:   Although Gilberto continues to train with Vasco da Gama, the Brazilian forward remains a member of Toronto FC.  “We have not sold him to Vasco, to any team in Brazil or any other team. Gilberto remains a TFC player,” Bezbatchenko said.  The recent addition of Giovinco means Toronto now has four designated players. MLS teams are only allowed three. Unless the new collective bargaining agreement currently being negotiated calls for the DP limit to be increased, Gilberto will be the odd man out—and MLS insiders tell Sportsnet that the chances of a fourth DP slot being added are “highly unlikely.”  Bezbatchenko said the team is still exploring its options within MLS and talking to other clubs. Although the European transfer deadline passed on Monday, the transfer window in Brazil and several other countries around the world doesn’t close until later this winter.  Toronto could also trade Gilberto or loan him out—it’s very unlikely they are going to pay his contract down to a non-DP level, as that would cost more than $800,000. So one way another, Gilberto will be gone.  “Nothing is imminent (in terms of a sale or trade or loan) but things can change pretty quickly. One way or another we have to be roster compliant by March 31,” Bezbatchenko said."
tfc,2uo1ej,warpus,2,Tue Feb 3 19:38:26 2015 UTC,Bezbatchenko said Giovinco topped a list of five possible designated player candidates he identified in the off-season.   Cheyrou and Perqius were non-DP singnings so this makes me really curious as to who those other targets were.

tfc,2uju0c,Jsikrtanc,2,Mon Feb 2 19:52:52 2015 UTC,It's good to see it have finally been allowed to relocations online instead of in person. that took seven years too long to switch
tfc,2uju0c,sfw84,3,Mon Feb 2 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed, this should be much better.  I would expect the same thing next year as roof construction will likely make the area off limits for visitors."

tfc,2uju0c,warpus,1 point,Wed Feb 4 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm I suppose I might as well ask about plans for the north end of the stadium  - from what I've seen phase 2 doesn't include the construction of a roof for the north end.  When is that going to happen?  It's in the plans, right?  Is the (un)official plan to see what happens with the Argos and to leave the north end the way it is now, so that they can be accommodated if and/or when that happens?  tl;dr: Not a season seat question but a stadium expansion question: We want more roof - when will we get it?"
tfc,2uju0c,quelar,2,Mon Feb 2 20:21:01 2015 UTC,"There will not be a roof over the North End stands from the latest drawings I've seen. If there are going to be concerts, Winter Classic, and other events it looks like they will bring in heavy equipment through that area and the structure needs to be able to move - making it difficult to keep a connected roof over that area."
tfc,2uju0c,warpus,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:30:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer.  I've seen renders/drawings from a while ago highlighting the possibility of having a roof over all 4 stands - while at the same time allowing temporary stands to be brought in both for the north and south stands, increasing capacity to 40,000 - enough for the events you mention.  I believe that was the initial plan, which makes me wonder what might have changed between then and now.  I do hope that one day we have a roof over all 4 stands - otherwise the stadium seems somewhat..  incomplete."
tfc,2uju0c,grabmit,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:37:05 2015 UTC,For sure. There will likely be continual improvements even after the roof is complete next year so we'll keep our fingers crossed.

I put this together using a flat 4-4-2 because it shows our depth across each midfield position pretty clearly.   Bloom got a raise, but his salary is from last year since the MLSPU hasn't released salaries in a while.  None of the draft picks have been signed yet, so I haven't put them up yet Perquis' salary is a guess based on reports I assumed Chapman and Manella got league minimum wages, just like when other academy kids signed Gilberto is there for completion's sake, and Konopka is there even though he's likely gone for our draft pick Bono"

It should be fixed now.  As of right now we actually don't know what Bloom is getting paid since he just finished negotiating a new contract. Last year he was definitely great bang for buck though and I think there are only a couple fullbacks already in the league that I'd view as a definite upgrade over him."
tfc,2uc7b1,errboi,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:24:18 2015 UTC,"No worries, some peopel take it as a threat to have it twice, no idea why.    That makes sense, as long as it isn't Eckersley wages, I'll be fine."
tfc,2uc7b1,Menessy27,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:26:25 2015 UTC,"It's always fun to play the off-season salary cap game, but it's especially difficult this season what with the CBA negotiations probably changing the roster rules and cap amount. Eckersley was basically on DP money (I think he was on 325K a year or something). In the current cap system there's a lot of room between Bloom's previous wages and Eckersley's wages that I'd say is still overpaying bloom. I'd say more than 150K-175K  for Bloom under the current cap constraints would be a little rich for my tastes. Now if the cap doubles is paying 300K for Bloom going to be worth it? Still probably not. Just because more money is available doesn't mean a player is worth more. It does mean you can pay an underpaid player their value without hamstringing yourself though.   Sorry if I'm rambling."

tfc,2u3lps,TreyGrant10,2,Thu Jan 29 18:24:19 2015 UTC,He plays a different position lol.. Bradley will play mid now and I think we won't be playing with wingers which is what we need to play possession style Football
tfc,2u3lps,Swervitu,2,Thu Jan 29 19:04:44 2015 UTC,Looks like that might be the plan where he plays as a wide left player who cuts in often like he did quite a bit last season
tfc,2u3lps,Menessy27,3,Thu Jan 29 21:55:31 2015 UTC,I think i will follow a little Toronto for see what will do Cheyrou :)
tfc,2u3lps,Tigrafr,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:16:58 2015 UTC,Should be exciting. Hopefully he meshes well with Bradley and Giovinco.

tfc,2u3lps,Swervitu,2,Thu Jan 29 19:03:03 2015 UTC,"I think I may finally understand what they are doing here, we know that TFC loves their 2ST sets but it seems like we are really pushing a narrow 442 diamond with some rocks in the back (this signing) and flair in the centre (bradley/oso) a prolific 10 (Giovinco) and Jozy with a partner up top (Moore?)   Possibly they are trying to play the Chelsea style 4231 with Cheyrou being our Matic and Bradley as our Cesc. Giovinco, Lovitz, Oso as our wingers"
tfc,2u3lps,Cuj0XXX,6,Thu Jan 29 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"TFC doesnt love 2 strikers, Nelsen did because its the most basic formation and he is a basic coach with very limited tactics"

tfc,2u3lps,Soldado4lyf,1 point,Thu Jan 29 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"Why? He could easily be utilized as a box-to-box player like Henderson at Liverpool is. If not you could use a narrow 4-2-2-2 with Cheyrou and Bradley as CDM's then Osorio and Giovinco attacking. I'm just throwing out ideas, but as long as we're winning I'll be happy."

Bendik, although not the best keeper in MLS, is a character guy who loves Toronto and wants to be the #1 guy here. I'm sure he wasn't happy with Cesar coming in but sucked it up and used it as a learning experience. Hate to do that to him again. He'll do fine this year with a much improved team ahead of him."
tfc,2u4gff,wideawakeairfield,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:56:11 2015 UTC,This season there were some games where Bendik had some amazing saves and was in great form. I don't know what the defining factor is for him to turn super saiyan but the guy has it in him.   Plus.. Most of the goals against us where due to weak defense or Bradley giving away the ball lol.. Bendik didn't have a big part in our downfall towards the end.
tfc,2u4gff,iamthelight_,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"According to him, he was happy for the learning experience.  As for needing Howard on our team, I think we can survive without him making a crucial difference.

I didn't double count players in this for depth chart, just assumed the primary/preferred position but recognize someone like Oso could play wide, Haggs could play RB if needed.  4-3-3 only selected as that seems to be what Vaney has been talking about a lot lately.  Seems really narrow, but maybe its for a possession based game? I'd say that's a really strong spine..."

tfc,2tvw5t,danoo,8,Tue Jan 27 21:55:20 2015 UTC,"You guys need to let go of the paying down Gilberto thing. It ain't happening. They'd have to to pay down his 1.2 million to 400k. How much of that would rather be used on holes we have instead. That's IF we even have that much allocation, which I highly doubt. Not only that, if they don't add a fourth DP then we just delayed the inevitable until next year."
tfc,2tvw5t,Menessy27,2,Tue Jan 27 22:11:19 2015 UTC,Exactly. He wouldn't even be a starter either

tfc,2tvw5t,Menessy27,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:44:08 2015 UTC,So you think he would be starting ahead of Altidore making 4m a year? of course not. And we're playing a 1 striker formation.

tfc,2tvw5t,Menessy27,2,Wed Jan 28 03:43:40 2015 UTC,Vanney has already said he's going to play a 4-3-3 and that formation is going to be instituted club-wide including the academy/probably the USL team. There's no chance we were going to play 4-4-2.
tfc,2tvw5t,TorontoFC15,3,Wed Jan 28 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"He had a place surely, why would we even do that?! Unless of course we plan on playing narrow now. But it still doesn't explain why on earth we would trade him to Montreal."
tfc,2tvw5t,Menessy27,1 point,Tue Jan 27 21:32:52 2015 UTC,Ya I thought he would actually fit in. I can only assume they want to use his 250k in cap space and the allocation to bring in someone else.

tfc,2tvw5t,errboi,1 point,Wed Jan 28 02:23:29 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you mean about time not being on his side? As in he's getting close to retirement age? Or as in the transfer window is closing so he needs to make a move overseas soon or not at all?
tfc,2tvw5t,hurleyburleyundone,1 point,Wed Jan 28 05:11:41 2015 UTC,His age primarily. He's a 30 year old winger.
tfc,2tvw5t,balapete,2,Wed Jan 28 14:04:23 2015 UTC,we already have a depth problem on the wings.. I liked oduro's sprints down the side.  also had the coolest hair on our team by far
tfc,2tvw5t,goonerdavid,2,Tue Jan 27 22:16:23 2015 UTC,"He really added something extra when he came into the side. This is pretty disappointing to me, he made a relatively slow MLS pretty pacey. Can't agree with this move."
tfc,2tvw5t,hurleyburleyundone,2,Tue Jan 27 22:21:19 2015 UTC,I would rather choose good decision making and the ability to make a 5 yard pass perfectly 9/10 times over pace any day. Oduro could do neither of those 2 things.

tfc,2tv3za,PagingDrFreeman,7,Tue Jan 27 18:07:15 2015 UTC,"Well there you have it. I, for one, will really miss the guy. He's got a lot of promise in his career."
tfc,2tv3za,quelar,5,Tue Jan 27 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"I'm much happier with him heading to Brazil, at least then he won't be showing up against us like Laba, Urruti, and the long list of other MLS players we've tossed off.  Still sucks though.   Maybe we see some sort of ""loan"" deal??  Please?"
tfc,2tv3za,denMAR,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with regards to playing for MLS, but my worst fear is that the rules  change allowing for a 4th DP in a the next few weeks/months and that we traded away Gilberto before that could happen."
tfc,2tv3za,errboi,2,Tue Jan 27 21:40:57 2015 UTC,"As much as I like Gilberto (and I like him a lot), I think I've managed to convince myself we can find another player of his caliber fairly easily during the summer window if they do allow for a 4th DP."
tfc,2tv3za,quelar,2,Tue Jan 27 21:47:41 2015 UTC,I'd rather keep the guy we spent the better part of a year fitting into the team then start again with a new person.
tfc,2tv3za,Menessy27,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"Fitting into the team means nothing really... new season, new players, new coach, new formation, new tactics."
tfc,2tv3za,errboi,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:40:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd agree with Quelar that I'd rather keep a guy who was here last year and showed promise, but where was Gilberto going to play in the 4-3-3 that Vanney keeps talking about? He's not a winger and from his interviews he sounded like he wasn't really happy about the idea of playing anything other than out and out striker."
tfc,2tv3za,errboi,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:54:33 2015 UTC,there's been a lot of personnel changes (surprise surprise) and with a new coach who has already said he'll be playing with different tactics than the ones we saw last season Gilberto doesn't really have much of an advantage over any new guy they bring in.
tfc,2tv3za,quelar,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:56:57 2015 UTC,Yeah because new everything has worked out so well for us year to year.  The point is that he was linking up with our midfield. That can take time. I don't expect giovinco to score on his debut.
tfc,2tv3za,Menessy27,1 point,Tue Jan 27 23:36:03 2015 UTC,You'd think he would have managed more than 7 goals if he was linking up with our midfield so well...

tfc,2tv3za,Kim_Jong_Unchained,4,Tue Jan 27 19:05:09 2015 UTC,yeah. I think he would have been great this year but sadly it didn't work out. At least he won't be scoring against us.

tfc,2tv3za,drretro,1 point,Tue Jan 27 23:59:03 2015 UTC,That would make sense. Otherwise teams could just buy a player and then sell him immediately and gets tons of allocation. I doubt we sell him for a profit

tfc,2twomg,errboi,1 point,Wed Jan 28 14:31:46 2015 UTC,My guess is 6. I think we would bring in a winger and another central midfielder if we had spots 4 and 5. But who knows really
tfc,2tuqfr,grabmit,3,Tue Jan 27 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"The CBA will be agreed upon before the start of the season, so we will know within a month and a bit what Gilbertos fate will be, but it seems there are only two options for keeping him at TFC:    1) We get a 4th DP slot in the new CBA which allows us to keep him as is. 2) The new CBA increases the max salary cap per player from 350k to something much higher, allowing us to buy down Gilberto's contract to a non-DP status with our saved up Garber bucks.    If neither of those two options are available, we gotta ship him elsewhere, ideally outside of MLS, as I don't think I can handle watching another ex-TFC player destroy us."
tfc,2tuqfr,omgChubbs,2,Tue Jan 27 17:46:08 2015 UTC,"Why is a loan out for a season out of the question?  I've just seen the reports that he is going to be sold, but I assume that they tried to loan him out first..  unless there are some complications with that sort of plan?"
tfc,2tuqfr,warpus,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"I had assumes that DP players could not be loaned out, but I could be wrong about that.  Rumors are already swirling about Gilberto being linked back to Brazil, which seems to be the best move for all parties, if keeping him is out of the question."
tfc,2tuqfr,omgChubbs,2,Tue Jan 27 19:54:01 2015 UTC,theres no place for him in the lineup
tfc,2tuqfr,Menessy27,4,Tue Jan 27 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ. 4-4-2 with Altidore and Gilberto up front would be great, especially fed by a CAM Giovinco."
tfc,2tuqfr,Makelevi,1 point,Tue Jan 27 21:56:18 2015 UTC,"My best option would be to sell him, like Henry, to another club at a massive discount but with the idea they pay the majority of his salary and they loan him back to us. This would be a one year play with the concept of buying him back at and inflated price (essentially just using the other club as a holding company who makes a few bucks at the end of things) when the 4th DP spot comes into play."
tfc,2tt6tq,Kim_Jong_Unchained,1 point,Tue Jan 27 05:19:17 2015 UTC,"One of the things from the video: He says that they are considering loaning Gilberto out as one of the things they are looking at to rectify the..  situation.  If we don't end up with 4 DPs and there are no magical tricks they can employ to keep him around, a loan would be the best thing to do..  I think.  Mind you he also mentioned that they are considering selling him as an option.."

tfc,2tq121,holy__mackinaw,3,Mon Jan 26 15:00:34 2015 UTC,Very good signing.  I still think we need another CB as you can't really rely on Caldwell lasting the whole season without injury.  But a massive step in the right direction for the backline.
tfc,2tq121,discostu81,4,Mon Jan 26 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"We also picked up Zavaleta from Seattle for a draft pick, it's mentioned in this story: http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/toronto-fc-signs-polish-defender-perquis/"
tfc,2tq121,ubeatha,3,Mon Jan 26 17:50:35 2015 UTC,"For depth in that position we need 1 more..  but I think they're going to rely on that French 21 year old we signed in the draft for that.

tfc,2tr4dx,now_we_here,5,Mon Jan 26 19:40:58 2015 UTC,"Based on his comments in a recent article by KJ, Vanney wants to play a 4-3-3.  Vanney heavily suggests he envisions Giovinco as a CAM playing behind a lone striker in Altidore, and Bradley paired in the middle with another midfielder to play as an 8 or a 6. We might end up in a scenario in which we roll with 2 CDM's behind Giovinco, in which I think Warner is a better partner for Bradley. If one of those midfielders is expected to get up in the play a bit more, Osorio is better suited. It's hard to get a picture of the first team without understand the specific roles of our midfielders.   Here's a very rough depth chart:   ST - Altidore / Moore / Findley / Dike CAM - Giovinco / Osorio CM - Bradley / Osorio / Warner CDM - Bradley / Warner / Creavalle LM - Jackson / Lovitz / Osorio RM - Oduro / Jackson LB - Morrow / Morgan RB - Bloom / Hagglund CB - Caldwell / Perquis / Zavaleta / Hagglund GK - Bendik / Konopka / Bono / Roberts   Personally, I don't rate Jackson that high and I think Lovitz may end up claiming that starting LM/LW role. Osorio is an option on the left wing as well, but I expect he will be counted on to play CAM until Giovinco arrives."
tfc,2tr4dx,R00K416,1 point,Tue Jan 27 01:10:29 2015 UTC,"With the strikeforce we have I would be tempted to play a 4-3-1-2.  That way Bradley gets a central role in midfield, and Giovinco in between him and the strikers.  It suits the players we have well, IMO.  I do see the benefits of playing with only 1 striker - Giovinco is.. firepower..  Maybe you don't need 2 strikers with him around.  But then I feel we would have to get rid of someone - we'd have too many strikers to give everyone playing time, especially if Gilberto stays.  I also kind of want Hamilton to stick around, so I'm biased."
tfc,2tr4dx,warpus,2,Tue Jan 27 02:00:31 2015 UTC,"ST: Altidore, Moore, Dike, Findley, Hamilton  LW: Jackson, Lovitz, Osorio?, Findley? - hope we bring in a winger for this spot  RW: Oduro, Jackson, Findley?  CAM: Giovinco, Osorio, Aparicio?  CM: Bradley, Osorio, Chapman  CM/DM: Warner, Creavalle, Bradley, Mannella? - could do with a player here too  LB: Morrow, Morgan  CB: Perquis, Zavaleta, Simonin  CB: Caldwell, Hagglund, Thomas  RB: Bloom, Creavalle, Charpie?

tfc,2to47r,juanroberto,7,Mon Jan 26 02:43:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly I have to say I'm pretty disappointed we're getting rid of Gilberto.  I feel like he could have had a big year this year.  Bradley for Laba was a little upsetting, but at least we knew for sure Bradley would come good for us.  I don't think I can confidently say the same thing for Jozy.  Not to mention forcing DPs out for two seasons in a row doesn't really give the club the whole ""stability"" angle they want."
tfc,2to47r,BasedPython,6,Mon Jan 26 00:43:35 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, selling Gilberto to Europe would open the floodgates for more talented Brazilians to come to MLS.  All of a sudden, we start buying low, give them a year or two to thrive, then sell high to desperate clubs in Europe."
tfc,2to47r,Soldado4lyf,3,Mon Jan 26 02:58:34 2015 UTC,Maybe.  But I doubt one instance will suddenly start a trend.  And it's not like Brazil isn't heavily scouted by top tier European clubs already.
tfc,2to47r,Soldado4lyf,2,Mon Jan 26 03:03:36 2015 UTC,Altidore > Gilberto  Giovinco = Defoe  Perquis > Henry  And Bradley has stayed.   There's nothing to complain about.
tfc,2to47r,LightsCameraRegret,2,Mon Jan 26 15:28:55 2015 UTC,"Altidore > Gilberto is debatable.  And even if you think Altidore is better than Gilberto, the difference is so minuscule that I wouldn't even consider it worth the shake-up for stability's sake.  Perquis is definitely better than Henry, but the problem last year wasn't with our first choice back-line, but our depth.  Still hasn't really be addressed yet."
tfc,2to47r,StJohnsFog,2,Mon Jan 26 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"Gilberto has had one good season in Brazil, and a mediocre one in MLS. Altidore was a top striker in Holland, scored more in his rookie year in MLS than Gilberto, and has been great for the us national team. All Gilberto has shown is that he could potentially be good in MLS."
tfc,2to47r,warpus,0,Mon Jan 26 15:44:43 2015 UTC,"Gilberto's season was mediocre in the number of goals he scored maybe, but not by his actual play.    Altidore was good in Holland, but never really made a break through at any other club he was at.  He hasn't proven himself to be a sure thing wherever he goes.  And MLS was a completely different animal back when Altidore was a rookie.  Comparing rookie seasons cross such different eras isn't really the best way to judge players."
tfc,2to47r,Soldado4lyf,9,Mon Jan 26 15:53:56 2015 UTC,I would really much rather have Gilberto over Altidore.
tfc,2to47r,Jedimindtrixxx,2,Mon Jan 26 04:43:04 2015 UTC,"Cheers to that.  I think we're going to regret this. I'm pretty sad about it. I'm pumped for the season to start, but I wanted Gilberto there for it."
tfc,2to47r,warpus,2,Mon Jan 26 12:55:26 2015 UTC,"The thing is that Gilberto prefers to play a supporting striker role while Altidore prefers to lead the line.  They are different types of strikers, and with Defoe out, we needed someone like Altidore.  I want Gilberto to stay, but with Giovinco coming in to play behind the striker(s), Altidore makes more sense than Gilberto, IMO."
tfc,2to47r,nodoubtguy,2,Mon Jan 26 21:48:55 2015 UTC,Thats dumb in every sense of the word. Altidore is immensely better than Gilberto.

Gilberto gave it his all 100% of the time last season. So many creative chances created because of him. That freekick moment with Defoe, and the goals that poured in afterwards - he'd tear up the MLS this season I think."

I think Bloom might have even gotten it at some point after everything went to hell in a hand basket. I guess my point is that there are only a couple fullbacks in the league that I would consider a definite upgrade over either of them."
tfc,2tes7f,errboi,6,Fri Jan 23 16:33:54 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I'd only suggest we require depth in those positions. Not sure about Morgan. I guess i'd be okay with Haggs filling in when needed
tfc,2tes7f,ElkoGroeschl,2,Fri Jan 23 17:02:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, assuming that we get Perquis, Hagglund would be backup for 2 positions.  I suppose the plan must be to pick up another defender - or rely on one of the draft picks to provide depth in defense.  Morgan didn't look great last season, but it seems like he's going to be sticking around."
tfc,2tes7f,warpus,2,Fri Jan 23 17:08:39 2015 UTC,"Morgan didn't really get a chance will Nelson, in my opinion. I don't think he's a starter, but I don't think we need to be afraid of using him in a pinch."
tfc,2tes7f,juanroberto,6,Sat Jan 24 16:31:40 2015 UTC,"Also, Hagglund was considered a possible Rookie of the Year - if anyone seriously considered defenders for that title."
tfc,2tes7f,mdps,5,Fri Jan 23 17:39:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ideally I'd like Hagglund to be a 3rd choice CB, but he showed that for the most part he's pretty solid when he gets the chance to start."
tfc,2tes7f,errboi,2,Fri Jan 23 18:02:32 2015 UTC,Quite solid for a rookie - especially when he was playing next to a veteran.

tfc,2tes7f,mdps,2,Fri Jan 23 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"Jackson's value isn't in his passing, or anything offense related for that matter. He can play ugly and shut down a tricky opposing winger. It's not pretty, but having someone like him around is an asset."
tfc,2tes7f,jztrumpeter,2,Fri Jan 23 20:52:50 2015 UTC,Aye. I'm a Jackson supporter
tfc,2tes7f,juanroberto,2,Sat Jan 24 16:32:05 2015 UTC,That strikes me as a pretty narrow skill set for a winger.
tfc,2tfq4c,Raisauce,2,Fri Jan 23 19:57:15 2015 UTC,"Vanney plays a 433 and thats what we'll be playing... it could be a weird 433 though, something where Osorio plays left wing and cuts in a lot while Oduro on the other side moves a bit more centrally to make it like a 4-4-2 at times... who knows"
tfc,2tfq4c,Menessy27,1 point,Fri Jan 23 22:19:43 2015 UTC,Depends on if we get a 4th DP spot with the new CBA or buy down Gilberto's contract. If either of those happen that a 4-1-2-1-2 would be preferred. If not a 4-3-3.

tfc,2tfq4c,juanroberto,-1,Sat Jan 24 16:20:11 2015 UTC,Think we should or think we will?  I think we should hold on to becker for depth and play a 4-3-3.  Gio looks more to me like an inside forward/winger then a CAM.  I think we will play some variant on 4-4-something.
tfc,2tfq4c,ubeatha,3,Fri Jan 23 20:58:14 2015 UTC,We already traded Bekker to Dallas for allocation money.

At the same time, wouldn't mind Bradley wearing it since he's our most influential player.  By the way, it's 'intents and purposes', not 'intensive purposes'."
tfc,2tdogq,ScreamingGerman,2,Fri Jan 23 13:56:36 2015 UTC,What's funny is I just learned this year that it's all 'intents and purposes' and not 'all intensive purposes'. I've been saying it wrong my whole life. I'm 32.

tfc,2tdogq,ScreamingGerman,7,Fri Jan 23 17:54:35 2015 UTC,"As long as Caldwell starts, he's the captain imo. He also has a lot of respect, speaks to the media a lot and seems well liked. I can't see them taking it away from him while he's still a starter"

tfc,2tdogq,arsenefinger,6,Fri Jan 23 15:50:23 2015 UTC,"Caldwell has been fine as captain.  To be honest I've never really felt it was all that important who the captain is. Some clubs just give it to the oldest player on the pitch. Either Bradley or Caldwell would be fine for the job (I'm sat firmly on the fence). Both are leaders, both have the respect of the other players, though sometimes Bradley can get a little hot under the collar with the referee. He needs to calm it down sometimes, no matter how aggrieved he feels.  Finally: its 'intents and purposes' (sorry)."
tfc,2tdogq,zGOLASO,1 point,Fri Jan 23 13:27:13 2015 UTC,"fixed that, definitely not one of my slickest proof reads there, but don't be sorry haha, thanks!  But I agree that' why it's such a hard choice, one one hand you have a capable player who has been a solid captain, and on the other you have the face and leader of the club. I really don't think there's a right answer, I was just curious to what everyone else thought :)"
tfc,2tdogq,R00K416,3,Fri Jan 23 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"I think over the past years, Caldwell has been extremely solid at the back and very valuable in how he leads our young centre backs. He's been one of the more consistent members of our team and has avoided injury for the most part. Although Bradley being captain would be good for the team as well, I feel that stripping him of the captaincy in favor of bradley would be the wrong move at this point."
tfc,2tdogq,Soldado4lyf,2,Fri Jan 23 14:01:49 2015 UTC,I don't think it particularly matters which of them is officially the captain. You need leaders on your team regardless of who wears an armband.
tfc,2tdogq,Texas_Cloverleaf,1 point,Fri Jan 23 14:29:07 2015 UTC,"Unless Caldwell himself volunteers to give it to Bradley, then he should stay captain."

I don't know what the deal with Bono is or why we drafted him, but he does add an extra option, some quality depth and good tradebait if a team has a keeper problem all of a sudden"
tfc,2tddl0,Coramoor_,2,Fri Jan 23 10:14:16 2015 UTC,"Take one look at our draft results historically and you'll find multiple players who played one season at TFC before being released.  We drafted Bono because he was likely the best player available in the eyes of TFC management. He's on a GA contract as well, so he won't count towards the salary cap. We may have some decent depth in goal right now, but Bono is already receiving USMNT looks and he may become the #1 keeper before all is said and done.  I think the idea is we need to do a better job of turning our draft picks into something more than temporary players. What's the point of drafting a worse player in a CB (because that's what we need right now) if you'll release him in a years time? Even if Bono doesn't start for 2 seasons, if he becomes a valuable asset for us, it's better than the alternative.  I thought Bono was a great pick."
tfc,2tddl0,R00K416,1 point,Fri Jan 23 14:33:35 2015 UTC,"I think he plays with TFC 2 as starter there, and given the chance, plays  for Bendik if he gets injured."
tfc,2tddl0,nazthetech,3,Fri Jan 23 05:34:15 2015 UTC,I doubt they would do that to Roberts though.
tfc,2tddl0,nazthetech,2,Fri Jan 23 05:39:05 2015 UTC,"True, I guess he's permanent slot in for TFC 2 with Quillian still second choice keeper. I want him doing well, he's Canada's future (damn you Begovic, never getting over him)"
tfc,2tddl0,ScreamingGerman,6,Fri Jan 23 05:41:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my guess with Bono is that we play him in cup and the occasional league game this year just to get him used to the pro level/lifestyle, then he becomes our starter next year."
tfc,2tddl0,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Fri Jan 23 05:47:02 2015 UTC,Why do you think he'll be #1 so fast?
tfc,2tddl0,Coramoor_,2,Fri Jan 23 05:56:37 2015 UTC,"He's got a much higher ceiling, and from what I've read about him he's not that much worse than Bendik."
tfc,2tddl0,Menessy27,2,Fri Jan 23 05:58:09 2015 UTC,"Do you scout him? Have you seen him play? He's a kid coming out of college, never played a pro minute before."
tfc,2tbr9q,ScreamingGerman,3,Thu Jan 22 20:41:15 2015 UTC,I think a player strike would damage this league and kill any progress made over the past few years of building it further.
tfc,2tbr9q,ExProxy,2,Fri Jan 23 14:32:44 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.

If he hasn't recovered since then and is more like his form in Spain, then well, Toronto still got a solid centerback for MLS standards I guess."

tfc,2t8j7m,TorontoFC15,1 point,Thu Jan 22 14:00:43 2015 UTC,Seriously... even if he's not at his best because of injuries or whatever he'd still be a decent centerback in MLS considering his experience. Also 30 isn't old at all for a centerback... if anything it's about the prime age.

The players we have selected since 2007:  2007   1st Overall - M Maurice Edu 10th Overall - D Andrew Boyens   2008   9th Overall - D Julius James 10th Overall - M Pat Phelan   2009   4th Overall - F O’Brian White 13th Overall - GK Stefan Frei   2010   N/A - Traded to FC Dallas for D Adrian Serioux   2011   N/A - Traded to Vancouver for M Nathan Sturgis   2012   4th Overall - M Luis Silva 12th Overall - D Aaron Maund   2013   3rd Overall - M Kyle Bekker 16th Overall - F Emery Welshman   Some of the picks turned out well.  Edu won MLS Rookie of the Year and played 2 seasons before signing with Rangers F.C. Stefan Frei established himself as the team’s first choice keeper for 3 years, before being displaced by Joe Bendik. Luis Silva played two years before being traded for Allocation Money, and just finished the 2014 campaign with 11 goals in 25 games for DC United.   Most of the picks were absolute busts.  Andrew Boyens was released after his rookie year with TFC, he no longer plays in MLS. Julius James played one year with TFC before being traded to Houston for De Rosario, he no longer plays in MLS. Pat Phelan was traded to New England for an International Roster Spot and never played a game for TFC, he has since retired to pursue a career in Financial Planning. O’Brian White played 2 seasons with TFC before being taken by Vancouver in the 2010 Expansion Draft, and hasn’t played a professional game since 2011 due to blood clots. Aaron Maund played one season for TFC before being traded to Real Salt Lake for Justin Braun, and he’s only played 8 games with RSL over 2 seasons. Emery Welshman was released by TFC after one season, he no longer plays in MLS.  Many of the players we chose never turned into players for any team, but we've also squandered some assets. We gave up on Silva after 2 seasons, and he turned out to be a decent player for DC United. I hope TFC is correct in their evaluation of Bekker this time."

tfc,2syguq,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:44:05 2015 UTC,"Different from what we're used to, but a midfield with Giovinco and Bradley will demand at least a third midfielder IMO. At which point, we may as well go with a narrow 4-3-3 and look for attacking width from the fullbacks."
tfc,2syguq,warpus,2,Mon Jan 19 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"I'm just not sure if our fullbacks are good enough for that to work well.  IMO we are going to start with 1 striker up front and 2 men out wide in midfield..  I mean, if Gilberto does stay, it would be silly to bench him, but I think with Giovinco in an attacking midfield position, we want to have wingers.    I'm almost resigned to have Gilberto leave at this point - Giovinco is in a way an upgrade over him.  They can play in very similar positions - as versatile as Giovinco is, I think slotting him right behind the leading striker is where they want to play him.  And that sort of leaves Gilberto out in the cold, especially since I tend to think that we will want more width in our midfield."
tfc,2syguq,ScreamingGerman,2,Mon Jan 19 20:00:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, solid point. It's easier to work in winger without Gilberto."
tfc,2syguq,errboi,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:22:46 2015 UTC,I think that Morrow is pretty good going forward.

Not that I'm complaining about having bench players.  I would think early season we're running CDM, Bradley, Jackson, Oduro, Altidore and Gilberto.   Once Giovinco comes in we drop out Jackson or Oduro. I just think the wider player are quickly becoming a weak point on the team and a few more spares might be nice.   Who knows though, I'm still trying to get this all sorted in my head, I could be 100% wrong on how Vanney sets this all up."

tfc,2sxr0s,Menessy27,2,Mon Jan 19 18:40:12 2015 UTC,"It's actually different situations. I can't believe nobody (including myself) really thought about this to point it out yet. But if Giovinco is signing in July, then he's not a TFC player until then so why would he count as a DP for us in March when he's not even our player?  Either way I also noticed that they didnt mention Gilberto at all. Even if there is a 4th DP spot and even with Giovinco not counting as a DP until July, I think Gilberto will be sold anyway. Kurt Larsen whos normally right also said quite a few times that he thinks TFC will sell Gilberto as soon as they get the right offer (and that they have multiple offers already). If we're playing with 1 striker then that will be Altidore and we're not going to pay Gilberto 1m a year to sit on the bench and he wouldnt accept a bench role either. Plus if we waited until just before July to sell him then teams could back us into a corner knowing we have to offload him to sign Giovinco and that would drive his price down. So it makes sense to just sell him in the next 1-2 months. I'm curious how much we'd get for him... somewhere between 2-4 million?"

Another CB, RB and defensive midfield are still on my shopping list.  Losing Laba for just money last year hurt, especially if him no longer being considered a DP is true. Bradley/Laba/Gio with Altidore, Gilberto and Oduro up front would be balling."

tfc,2swao4,CompletelyUnbaised,2,Mon Jan 19 16:05:54 2015 UTC,He should be an extremely effective central attacking midfielder in the MLS. Having him behind two big guys should be lethal.

Giovinco will finish out the current Serie A season with Juventus, and officially join Toronto FC in July.  The Italian is coming in as a designated player, which brings Toronto’s number of DPs to four—Michael Bradley, Jozy Altidore and Gilberto. Unless the new collective bargaining agreement, currently being negotiated between Major League Soccer and the players’ union, increases the DP limit to four per team, Toronto is going to have to sell one of them—in this case, most likely Gilberto."

I guess he could play attacking mid, he's very good technically but playing behind the strikers will limit his ability to use his speed. Also, his passing ability isn't particularly good. Still, he'd probably dominate MLS if he came over here and played in any attacking position."
tfc,2sqnrw,NathookGD,1 point,Sun Jan 18 00:34:25 2015 UTC,It's honestly the only position I can see him being utilized other than a winger if we play a 4-3-3.

I don't believe they've started negotiations yet and in all likelihood they'll probably end around a few weeks before the season starts.  For what it's worth, Twellman said in the summer that he would be shocked if a 4th DP spot wasnt added and if the cap didn't go up to around 4.5 million (it's currently 3.1 million) and he's usually right about pretty much everything so we'll see. A 4th DP spot and a raised cap would be huge for us to bring more quality into the team.  MLS doesn't necessarily need to bring in a ton of superstars but if teams could bring in more 200-300k type players then that would go a long way to improving the league."
tfc,2sr1v7,Menessy27,1 point,Sat Jan 17 22:28:45 2015 UTC,What level of cap would be needed so that MLSE's financial resources would guarantee a winner? Chasing a 4th DP is great but I'll be more excited when we have decent 2nd options at all positions.

tfc,2smi4r,Menessy27,1 point,Sat Jan 17 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"I think on the back end,  you don't need a DP,  just a solid MLS vet.  I really think the team is pushing for Giovinco with the expected 4th spot.  If he comes,  I think we're in a good spot..... But that's a big if."

tfc,2smvar,fuzz_boy,14,Fri Jan 16 15:26:51 2015 UTC,I was very excited when Defoe was signed by TFC (and I am not a TFC fan). I watched TFC matches for both Defoe and Hagglund. I never saw anything but support for Defoe until his will he/won't he act hit the stage. His transfer is addition by subtraction for TFC.
tfc,2smvar,LearnedObserver2,11,Fri Jan 16 15:30:05 2015 UTC,Bingo. I was at every home game last year and he got nothing but love until word got out that he wanted to leave.
tfc,2smvar,arsenefinger,6,Fri Jan 16 15:48:41 2015 UTC,"Even after that he still got love, just not as much.  If you're going to come to a club and then try to get out in the first transfer window, don't expect us to love you."
tfc,2smvar,FollowRafiki,2,Fri Jan 16 16:05:46 2015 UTC,"well, while I never saw much overt abuse, there was a guy in the south end who made a ""Judas"" banner just after news leaked out, and he brought it to games while Defoe was still injured.  But I absolutely agree, what did he expect? He's played professional football for a long time and knows the score."

tfc,2smvar,sfw84,3,Fri Jan 16 20:49:44 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really seem like an apt comparison for a couple reasons. The major effect tabloid coverage had on both those guys was loss of sponsorship deals which isn't an issue for Defoe. The other reason is that They actually were caught doing those things that the tabloids were talking about. There was no proof Defoe was attempting to engineer a move away from the club at the time the fans turned on Defoe. Once fans turned on him it's entirely possible he asked to be moved out. As other people have said, Defoe isn't going to be completely innocent in the matter, but I think fans made Defoe the scapegoat for a season that was spiraling down the drain."

He didn't, he let Harry Redknapp shoot his mouth off and made his statement when the deal with QPR didn't work out.  Look, I don't really care. He owes no loyalty to this city or this club and if he is homesick and wants to go home then that's what he wants to do. But he can't be surprised or upset that the fans turned on him.

Unless this guy is incredible, or we are getting some awesome return for Bendik and making this guy our starter I don't like the pick."
tfc,2sjfrc,Boethius13,5,Thu Jan 15 19:33:38 2015 UTC,He is a very very good young keeper - and we really don't have a backup - Roberts isn't even close imo.  I think its a great pick
tfc,2sjfrc,sasha_baron_of_rohan,2,Thu Jan 15 19:37:45 2015 UTC,Finally a voice of reason. I'm more unsure of our 2nd and 3rd picks than this one.
tfc,2sjfrc,Menessy27,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:25:30 2015 UTC,2nd and 3rd round picks arent really supposed to become anything in MLS so theyre basically roster filler for our USL affiliate and if they become a quality MLS player one day then it's just a bonus. In fact I believe it's something like 5% of players that are drafted after the top 10 picks become regular MLSers.
tfc,2sjfrc,Menessy27,2,Fri Jan 16 17:12:59 2015 UTC,because Bendik is average and Roberts has done nothing of note? they picked the best keeper in the draft to be a young backup and challenge for the starting position now and/or in the future... not sure whats wrong with that.

tfc,2sjesu,Makelevi,2,Fri Jan 16 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"My guess is  Bono - backup, Konopka gone, Roberts starter for TFC2  Thomas - first team, probably our 4th CB like Hagglund last season  Simonin - sounds less MLS ready than Thomas, TFC2  Rivas - track record is unimpressive and sounds really far away... will probably struggle for playing time at TFC2  Charpie - probably TFC2 starter and potentially first teamer if Bloom gets injured"

tfc,2scg2l,timdaw,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:48:58 2015 UTC,"That's your takeaway from this piece? You might want to read it again. I recommend this part:  ""His performances for the US national team are evidence that he can lead the line effectively and score goals. His record playing in the Stars and Stripes stands at a respectable 25 goals from 76 appearances.  Perhaps he simply wasn’t up to Premier League level, perhaps the Dutch league was the kind of standard he is suited for but it is hard to escape the feeling that Altidore’s career in Europe could have been so much more enjoyable and productive had he – or his advisors – made more sensible career decisions."""
tfc,2scg2l,Richard_Swinger_Esq,1 point,Thu Jan 15 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"My takeaway is that he's nowhere near good enough for the Premier league, my original statement was that he's easily the worst player in that league. TFC have traded one of the most talented players from the Premier league for, literally, the worst. He did well in Holland and playing for America, hardly top level stuff. Defoe didn't want to play for TFC and, seriously, who can blame him? Altidore is a massive drop in quality. He just is."
tfc,2scg2l,timdaw,1 point,Thu Jan 15 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"You didn't say it was a downgrade; you said he was an absolute donkey. Even arguing this is a downgrade, you're wrong. You're not comparing apples to apples. First, TFC doesn't play in the premier league, so it doesn't matter who's the better EPL player. Second, TFC didn't have Defoe. He wasn't going to play here. So, any player willing to suit up is an improvement. Of course, in an ideal world, anyone world rather (a healthy) Defoe than Altidore. That's not a very insightful observation. But, we're not in an ideal world. You've got to play the cards you're dealt. This is a good result from a bad hand. Altidore is a good player. And, I suspect he'll be available for more games."

tfc,2scg2b,arsenefinger,0,Wed Jan 14 12:05:35 2015 UTC,"He wasn't ready for Premier league football. Watch him in the Netherlands. Watch him pre-European move. He just didn't adapt to the premier league, this is the MLS."
tfc,2scg2b,TorontoFC15,1 point,Wed Jan 14 12:14:08 2015 UTC,"I watched his Eredivisie highlight reel. The defenders make Ty Harden look like the king of football. And he's been riding that reputation despite being useless ever since? Sorry, I don't buy it."
tfc,2scg2b,OtterBurger,1 point,Wed Jan 14 18:27:57 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating the quality of Dutch football...just a tad. He was on arguably the second best Dutch team there (I say arguably because it's a league where they really only compete for second. Thanks Ajax.) So obviously yes, they can outclass many teams defenders. But that's not to say Eredivisie is all around shit.  Let's dig further back. Pre-European move he has 15 goals in 37 games. You know for a young striker in the MLS I'll take it, certainly better than Defoe's 11 in 19 when he was getting a salary as big as he was.   Next up was Villareal where he spent 3 years and played 9 games and had 1 goal. Remind you he also was out on loan for most the time. He was loaned to Hull City in the '09 season. He put up dreadful numbers. 28 games played..1 goal. Right there is enough to see that he never adapted to the style of football.  Next up was AZ where he put up good numbers. 67 games and had 39 goals. AZ is also one of the best teams in Eredivisie so yes, they're going to be playing weaker defenses.   I'll skip Sunderland because once again, he never adapted. It happens. Another example is Soldado at Tottenham. Misses sitters in England but was a star in Spain.   He's not shit, and he's a hell of a better option than Defoe.   EDIT: He's also a starter for USMNT, clearly he has some talent."
tfc,2scg2b,TorontoFC15,1 point,Wed Jan 14 18:41:59 2015 UTC,"2007 MLS and 2015 MLS are very different leagues. People point to his USMNT work, but look at who he's scored against (NOT in friendlies, or the Confederations Cup which may as well be a friendly tournament). Average to below-average CONCACAF teams with, again, weak defences.   He is vastly overrated based on numbers he put up, what, two-three years ago? He's welcome to prove me wrong bit quite frankly that might say more about the quality of our league than about his personal skill."
tfc,2scg2b,OtterBurger,1 point,Wed Jan 14 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"Oh no doubt obviously they're very different. But for a young player, not too shabby.   Actually internationally he's been quite good to be fair. Tournaments isn't everything. For example, hat trick against Bosnia and Herzegovina which they aren't too terrible as a nation. They did make the world cup as a European nation.   I guess what we have to ask ourselves is, Is Jozy Altidore what American's hype him to be as? Easy. NO. He isn't. But, he's coming into a Toronto FC squad looking ahead at the future and going we have a chance to be a great team. We just need the right coaching. IMO it's better than still having Defoe. If he can't find his feet by July-August, then we should re-evaluate."

Do you know the history of petitioning and time the TFC fans had to do for real grass?    This is a mistake.

They can move out of the city for all I care.   I'd rather not have turf either. Everyone already complains about it. I believe MLSE has already told Argos no many times before. If the Mayor wants them to stay in Toronto so bad then build some stadium for them north of the city, leave BMO for some real football."

Like Bradley, Creavalle, Oduro (Unless we're planning on keeping him as a winger, then train him harder.)     This all isn't going to happen because we bought Bradley and Defoe."

I see him most likely going to parma, but they are fighting relegation, so if they get relegated then we might have a better chance. There are still plenty of other teams that would be interested though.  In terms of ability, he no doubt has what it takes for mls, I think he could do even better than Defoe.

There definitely seems to be enough experience there and even a plan.  A brief summary of what I remember:  (Disclaimer: My mind has been known to lie to me before, so some of this might be slightly inaccurate)   Sounds like last season Gilberto underestimated the league and came in a not so ready condition from the off-season - this time around his condition is being monitored and he is working hard to start the season fully fit and ready to go. They are looking to sign a CB or two and another attacking player, but feel that in central midfield and up front we are in full strength. Vanney is a smooth if at times quiet talker.  Gives good detailed answers.  I thought it was interesting that the only time I heard him get a bit nervous was right after he finished answering one of the questions about Defoe. They expect Defoe to stay."

tfc,2rnt7v,Menessy27,1 point,Wed Jan 7 21:54:05 2015 UTC,Is he even any better than Gilberto? Altidore was a top 5 scorer in the Dutch league and Gilberto was a top 5 scorer in the Brazilian league.

But realistically, there are too many holes and not enough resources to fill those holes with the kind of quality we need to get to the playoffs. TFC purposely stocked up on backup strikers (i.e. Dike, Findley) so that they wouldn't need to keep both Defoe and Gilberto. Imo a midfielder like Valeri would be the type of DP TFC is looking to acquire. I believe that if the Jozy - TFC rumors are true it's looking at Jozy as an upgrade on Gilberto, that's all"

tfc,2rbls9,Soldado4lyf,6,Sun Jan 4 21:39:05 2015 UTC,"IMO a new chant will only happen once a player steps up for quite a while and does something extraordinary.  For example, if Gilberto has a 25 goal season and leads us to the playoffs, and shows a lot of passion during games, he might very well get a chant.   If Bradley plays with us for a couple years and we end up loving him forever and ever - maybe a chant..  etc.  Basically you need momentum for this sort of thing, I think, and I see that as the most realistic way of a new chant being introduced to all the ones we already have - a chant honouring a player.  Otherwise the supporter groups will probably just stick to what they already have, and it's not so easy to start a brand new chant during a game on your own, especially if it's a unique one that other people might not know.   You'd need the support of the supporter groups to coordinate everything for the chant to not be instantly forgotten.  If you however manage to start yelling something out at a game and have the whole stadium join in, then I take back everything I said and I am with you."

tfc,2r19qa,errboi,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:10:50 2015 UTC,"if Morrow plays CB we're left with Morgan at LB. He's an excellent athlete and I'm willing to give him a chance to show he's grown as a footballer in the past couple years, but if there's a reason he fell so far from grace under Nelsen and Vanney both then... Well, he'd at least be a warm body. As for calling up TFC2 players, we can only call up players already on contract with the first team so that's not really much of a solution to depth problems."
tfc,2r19qa,Coramoor_,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:17:23 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer we sign someone who can play LM/LB than another CB, it would give us flexibility in two position that we don't currently have, as well as providing the depth to make a move such as Morrow to CB for a few games. I would love if Morgan got a chance to revitalize his career but I think he has to do that through TFC2 to start with, so we probably need another player in that position regardless. Surely there must be a CB within our academy that might be getting close to a first team contract, sign him, have him start with TFC2 and hope for the best, recall on an emergency basis if necessary"
tfc,2r19qa,Menessy27,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:21:52 2015 UTC,It is frustrating to think just how many gaps we have in our roster. And this is coming off the back of a year of relative stability so we haven't had nearly 100% roster rollover like some past years. At least we're mostly okay in terms of salary cap space so we can afford to make some moves.
tfc,2r19qa,TacoDirtyToMe,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:26:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're any worse off than most of MLS, we were absolutely fine this year until we were decimated by injuries all at the same time. Look at what happened to SKC when they ran out of steam, it's hard to have lots of quality depth when you operate in a salary cap world. Not complaining at all as I think the salary cap is necessary, although I'd like it to rise to around 5 million after the CBA talks."
tfc,2r19qa,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:31:11 2015 UTC,Hopefully the cap goes up by a lot with the CBA negotiations... i'm hoping for a 4 million cap at least. Some people have suggested a luxury tax cap like the NBA has which would help richer teams spend more but also help poorer teams by redistributing that luxury tax to other teams through allocation and/or making the teams pay player salaries themselves past the 4 million cap.
tfc,2r19qa,TacoDirtyToMe,2,Sat Jan 3 00:15:16 2015 UTC,If we get rid of Defoe and free up a DP spot we could go for van der Vaart for the #10. His contract is up in the summer so it wouldn't cost a transfer fee.

tfc,2r19qa,TacoDirtyToMe,1 point,Fri Jan 2 02:57:37 2015 UTC,well although he's been pretty decent for Hamburg they finished 16th out of 18 teams last season and had to go through a relegation playoff to stay up. They currently sit 14th right now (and aren't looking very good). I don't know if he'd want to stay there much longer but I'm sure if the money looks nice he'd be more than happy to come over here.

tfc,2r19qa,ScreamingGerman,2,Fri Jan 2 17:26:40 2015 UTC,They've been awful. They sat between 16th and 18th (there's 18 Bundesliga teams if you wanted more clarification) in the league for the first 10 or so games. But they sort of picked it up recently and are 14th.

tfc,2r19qa,TacoDirtyToMe,6,Fri Jan 2 02:57:06 2015 UTC,Fucking Steve Gerrard who's leaving Liverpool after this season and we should sign him on a bosman (if Defoe leaves). I don't care if we 'don't need him' he'd provide for our strikers and allow Bradley to roam much more freely in the attacking third because Gerrard would probably be used as a DLP and would just sit back and launch passes to wingers and strikers.
tfc,2r19qa,errboi,3,Thu Jan 1 23:09:43 2015 UTC,"That'd be like trying to play Gerrard and lampard together. Need a tackler in there, those are two offensive minded midfielders."

That would be massive for this city. Much more so than Jermaine Defoe.   I am pretty passive when it comes to sport, but I have been a vocal Gerrard supporter since I was 15.

tfc,2r19qa,errboi,3,Fri Jan 2 02:20:14 2015 UTC,Well we need either a DM or an AM because Bradley has been trying to play both positions every single game and we get caught out when he tries to attack. He can't play both. Or rather make Gerrard play an attacking style and have Bradley sit back. Or possibly try to pick up Rafael van der Vaart as a CAM and DP because his contract runs out in June.
tfc,2r19qa,TacoDirtyToMe,-4,Fri Jan 2 02:43:55 2015 UTC,No thanks. I don't think we need any more defensive liabilities.
tfc,2r19qa,ScreamingGerman,3,Fri Jan 2 00:02:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone has their own opinions, but Gerrard would bring a lot more to the team than being a ""defensive liability""   His long passing is amazing, he can take corners, free kicks (long and short) well, great vision, and is a known leader.      He isn't a natural defensive midfielder so I can see why he makes mistakes but I can't see how anyone would say no to him, or any top  midfielders."
tfc,2r19qa,CompletelyUnbaised,5,Fri Jan 2 01:54:54 2015 UTC,I would say no. Old players on their last leg are not the kind of players we should be pursuing.
tfc,2r19qa,supportingTFC,3,Fri Jan 2 02:20:56 2015 UTC,Rafael van der Vaart than? His contracts up in the summer and he's Defoe's age.
tfc,2r19qa,warpus,2,Fri Jan 2 02:45:09 2015 UTC,Yeah but that's a lot of what Bradley does already. I think Gerrard would be class for MLS but would be hard to fit two very similar players into the team.

tfc,2ppwoj,LightsCameraRegret,3,Thu Dec 18 22:28:02 2014 UTC,"To be honest I think this all depends.  What if that 4th round pick turns out to be amazing?  What if Hall gets a chance to play with different people that he has better chemistry with and gets in the starting 11?    If I wasn't playing for one team for more than a year, I'd gladly trade teams at a chance to show a new boss what I can do.   Plus, I think it's Rev's saying ""I'd rather have someone with a bit of experience than a 4th round draft pick.""  Maybe they do have a plan for him.  Or you know, his is worth a 4th round draft pick."
tfc,2ppwoj,notdarren,2,Fri Dec 19 13:43:52 2014 UTC,Must suck even more being a 4th round pick.

tfc,2pp3ho,sfw84,2,Thu Dec 18 19:19:58 2014 UTC,"And what is going to happen to Defoe in two weeks? I don't really see any indication within the article itself, just grumpy fans jumping on the Defoe hate bandwagon in the comments."
tfc,2pp3ho,errboi,1 point,Thu Dec 18 20:28:16 2014 UTC,"Was Defoe disgruntled and determined to leave as quickly as he arrived? straight for the article. like i said before and it's been shown on here (well r/mls) and other soccer websites, mls does control alot of what is said with anyone that writes for any website that works with mls or an mls team (as expected). i wouldn't expect someone in the higher up offices of mls to allow even wording like that. of course i could just have my tin foil hat on a little too tightly"
tfc,2pp3ho,sfw84,2,Thu Dec 18 20:51:33 2014 UTC,Maybe. Even if Defoe were to leave I wouldn't necessarily be convinced that the writer of this article had any more insight into the situation than the rest of us. I can see where you are coming from though.

Is it fun reading articles and assuming people mean the exact opposite of what they are saying? I imagine they have contingencies for if someone makes them an offer they can't refuse for Michael Bradley as well. It doesn't mean they intend to sell him."
tfc,2pj6pu,DragonicKhaos,7,Wed Dec 17 01:52:25 2014 UTC,"Wow. Hard to imagine Convey and Jackson in the all time starting XI. I personally would have Alen Stevanovic from his brief loan spell, and maybe Pablo Vitti or Maurice Edu...Also Orr and Cann seem out of place... But I guess you're going off player ratings from Fifa for those years? We've had some great depth over the years either way, unfortunately just not all at once."
tfc,2pj6pu,wideawakeairfield,1 point,Wed Dec 17 03:27:12 2014 UTC,I liked Cann but for overall XI I'd pick Serioux over him.
tfc,2pj6pu,OtterBurger,3,Wed Dec 17 09:37:46 2014 UTC,Also a mention that Defoe was rated the highest in MLS last year. Also note I have chosen the players not by on field play quality but on how high fifa had rated them over the years
tfc,2pj6pu,errboi,3,Wed Dec 17 02:03:19 2014 UTC,Man. This is depressing.
tfc,2pj6pu,omgChubbs,3,Wed Dec 17 04:39:49 2014 UTC,"So much wrong with this lineup.  You can't put Jackson on the seasons best XI, let alone all time. Convey, Morrow and Orr as well.  I would put DeRo back in the midfield with Koevermans up top beside Defoe.  Geuvarra likely deserves a midfield spot as well.  O'Dea should be alongside Caldwell.  Edit: Just saw your revised lineup below, looks much better.  However I still think Amado deserves a spot, (although he did have his moments of laziness), and Stevanovic could liekly be swapped for Plata (if judging by their output at TFC, Stevanovic was a bust)"
tfc,2pj6pu,now_we_here,2,Thu Dec 18 18:19:49 2014 UTC,"Is this based on rating in the game? Because you need Mo Edu and Danny Koevermans, not to mention Darren O'Dea.  Adrian Cann, Jackson, and Bobby Convey?  Nah."
tfc,2pj6pu,jztrumpeter,2,Wed Dec 17 05:15:07 2014 UTC,"Jackson, Orr, and Convey should be nowhere near this team"
tfc,2pj6pu,errboi,1 point,Wed Dec 17 21:10:36 2014 UTC,"Clearly we have had terrible wide players. If you switched to a 4-4-2 diamond you could run DeRo at CAM, Koevermans up top, and Edu at CDM with Frings and Bradley playing CM. Much better all-star line up than one including Convey and Jackson."

tfc,2p4gob,errboi,3,Sun Dec 14 18:40:37 2014 UTC,Gilberto has a season under his belt now. I would bet that he at least doubles his goal tally from last year. I grew a beard for the guy he owes me haha.

tfc,2p434u,wideawakeairfield,2,Fri Dec 12 21:04:58 2014 UTC,Why?
tfc,2p434u,errboi,3,Fri Dec 12 21:13:18 2014 UTC,"I guess just a substitute forward to replace Weideman/Dike. Does anyone know much Findley makes? If its higher than either of those guys, we should have just kept one of them instead. I only see him subbing into 5-10 games next year at most. Would have preferred to sign a younger South American forward instead and develop him."
tfc,2p434u,DisembodiedHand,2,Fri Dec 12 21:24:40 2014 UTC,215k. And I completely agree that that money could have been better spent in South America.
tfc,2p434u,DisembodiedHand,1 point,Fri Dec 12 21:27:43 2014 UTC,215?? Wow. I like this move even less knowing that. That amount could have gotten us a pretty decent CB(s) which we really need. Hopefully we got a shitload of funny money in the Laba deal to spend that much on another FW thats 4th/5th down the pecking order.
tfc,2p434u,errboi,1 point,Fri Dec 12 21:33:21 2014 UTC,We'll never know what the amount for Laba was but let's imagine it's 500k-1m. The cap also goes up this year so we're not hurting for money but agreed on the point that the priority should be to build from the back. Findley's a good third option if we trade anyone and if he finds his form again.
tfc,2p434u,now_we_here,1 point,Fri Dec 12 23:46:11 2014 UTC,definitely makes too damn much. Might be we're expecting to be tight on international slots next season so they're looking to fill up on domestic options. Don't know that I see him being that much of an improvement over Wiedeman or Dike though.
tfc,2p434u,Makelevi,1 point,Fri Dec 12 21:30:31 2014 UTC,Meh.  Can he play wing?
tfc,2p434u,Menessy27,1 point,Fri Dec 12 21:08:10 2014 UTC,"Wait, does that mean he has the same wage he had at Real Salt Lake? Because that is too damn much for a player struggling to find his form from years ago."

tfc,2p012m,warpus,3,Thu Dec 11 20:57:49 2014 UTC,"Well said. I didn't like the rumors we heard about goings on this summer, however, Defoe seemed to respond reasonably to them. My anger stemmed from losing his. We were a notably superior team at the start of the season when he and Bradley were both playing well. He is a high quality talent and one we would be worse off losing."
tfc,2p012m,Richard_Swinger_Esq,2,Thu Dec 11 21:38:43 2014 UTC,"Unlike most of the news surrounding TFC, the reports of his wanting out had credibility, especially after Lieweke basically told him to eff off. If the bosses think he wants out, there's something to it. His lack of denials only fueled the fire.  People felt let down. Myself included. Once again somebody was just passing through. That said, if he's here next season, we were all wrong or Defoe changed his mind. Either way, clean slate."

tfc,2ow60d,TorontoFC15,6,Wed Dec 10 19:34:33 2014 UTC,And he's back on TFC... Lovitz re-acquired
tfc,2ow60d,RealKidA,6,Wed Dec 10 22:44:04 2014 UTC,"We retain the services of Bloom. God damnit Bez, way to not protect Lovitz."
tfc,2ow60d,feb914,2,Wed Dec 10 19:35:14 2014 UTC,"my hypothesis is Bloom and Bez made a bet that Bloom left unprotected with hopes that Orlando would pick him, but if another TFC player was picked first, he'll be protected. that's the only possible reason."
tfc,2ow60d,juanroberto,4,Wed Dec 10 20:21:12 2014 UTC,"Or TFC just gambled that Lovitz would go before Bloom, and everything went according to plan.  Apparently Lovitz will earn a nice raise, since any supplimental roster spot guys were picked today they have to be upgraded as per the draft rules."
tfc,2ow60d,feb914,1 point,Wed Dec 10 21:00:56 2014 UTC,"oh, good for him. if they didn't have to renegotiate contract, NYCFC picked up a cheap player with good potential."
tfc,2ow60d,LightsCameraRegret,3,Wed Dec 10 21:14:15 2014 UTC,"He can't even afford to live in New York, right?"
tfc,2ow60d,juanroberto,2,Wed Dec 10 20:33:57 2014 UTC,"He'll get a nice raise, as per the rules in the draft."
tfc,2ow60d,notdarren,3,Wed Dec 10 21:01:11 2014 UTC,"No one liked my song anyway...     ""We Lovitz! We Lovitz! We Lovitz! Especially when you cross it, you cross it, you cross it!""

tfc,2ow60d,errboi,1 point,Wed Dec 10 22:29:57 2014 UTC,Actually Bloom has a whole bunch of family who travel and go to games. Most of them wear his jerseys.

tfc,2ow60d,errboi,2,Wed Dec 10 23:32:24 2014 UTC,Aaaaaaand Lovitz is back in exchange for a little funny money. Sounds like a solid day's work by Bezbatchenko.
tfc,2ow60d,mafiazul,1 point,Wed Dec 10 22:52:23 2014 UTC,I really didn't want to lose oduro. I didn't think anyone would grab him anyways.
tfc,2ow60d,mafiazul,4,Wed Dec 10 19:41:28 2014 UTC,"We were likely good there thanks to his cap hit, it was Bloom and Lovitz everyone was worried about. That decision to not protect Lovitz will likely bite us in the ass."
tfc,2ow60d,errboi,2,Wed Dec 10 19:42:40 2014 UTC,i thought bloom was gone and we would protect lovitz. Went the other way around.
tfc,2ow60d,warpus,1 point,Wed Dec 10 19:53:22 2014 UTC,Meh. I didn't really expect anyone to take Lovitz. He's serviceable but nothing really spectacular. It will be interesting to see how well he does for NYC.
tfc,2ow60d,R00K416,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:11:26 2014 UTC,Lovitz was promising..  I hope we sign a decent replacement.
tfc,2ow60d,rsoccer,3,Wed Dec 10 19:56:29 2014 UTC,I hope we draft a better replacement.
tfc,2otf8x,RealKidA,6,Wed Dec 10 01:24:45 2014 UTC,"He's a midfielder, he's 33 and he's from Argentina. What the hell? Don't get me wrong, I love Argentine talent but a 33 year old midfielder is not exactly what we need. We'll just have to wait and see.  EDIT: Just a bit of skimming, it seems he's more intrested in moving here than us be intrested in bringing him to the club. There is contact he stated but no big developments yet. Seriously, if this happens I really want to know what the hell we are doing signing him."
tfc,2otf8x,TorontoFC15,3,Wed Dec 10 04:03:28 2014 UTC,"Picking up a competent CDM (since everyone insists Bradley should play farther forward) wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. His age is a bit of a concern for sure, but he's pretty much lead his team in minutes played for years now, so he doesn't seem to be slowing down too much yet. Might get 2-3 years out of him."
tfc,2otf8x,errboi,2,Wed Dec 10 07:39:45 2014 UTC,"Certainly hasn't showed signs of slowing down no, but I'm concered it might just not be a worthy investment."
tfc,2otf8x,TorontoFC15,1 point,Wed Dec 10 10:36:56 2014 UTC,Bradley's nothing like Frings/Laba. We could certainly use one of those guys to really allow Bradley to play his proper game. Similar to how Fabregas and Matic combine at Chelsea.
tfc,2otf8x,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Wed Dec 10 21:09:31 2014 UTC,"If he's a good player then why not? assuming we're moving to a 3 man midfield then we'll need a holder because at the moment we only have new DP/Osorio/Bradley/Creavalle/Warner/Bekker. The last 3 shouldnt be starters, Bradley isnt a holder and Osorio is far from it. TFC will probably need to bring in 2-3 central midfielders this offseason so if he's good and at a decent price then bring him in. Having said that I have absolutely no idea how good he is though."
tfc,2otf8x,Menessy27,3,Wed Dec 10 22:29:09 2014 UTC,Guillermo is a strong ball winner which should give Bradley more freedom to push forward in support of the attack. He should come reasonable cheap at his age and still offer plenty of minutes for the team alongside leadership and experience.
tfc,2otf8x,xeneize,3,Wed Dec 10 14:46:39 2014 UTC,"Depending on how much we'd pay him, I'm not against this move.  Lots of positives, even if his age is..  ..  well..  you know."
tfc,2otf8x,warpus,2,Wed Dec 10 16:10:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah. TFC would instantly have a strong core, not just one good guy in the middle. Also, he sounds like a class act, and given the flux in the organization of late, a bit of experience & leadership in the locker room isn't the worst thing, even if he only stays a couple of years.   And hey, keeping the lines of communication with South Americans will only help with convincing future players to come up here moving forward."
tfc,2otf8x,thetonyhightower,2,Wed Dec 10 16:13:58 2014 UTC,I would rather not take on a 33 year old.

tfc,2op4uq,R00K416,4,Mon Dec 8 23:36:11 2014 UTC,"I'm suprised people are suprised Bloom is unprotected. Wife and kid are in Florida, it's hard enough being what, 1200+ miles away? I'm sure there is a deal in place for him to end up down there. Best of luck to him."
tfc,2op4uq,TorontoFC15,3,Tue Dec 9 00:42:40 2014 UTC,Actually now that you mention it from that perspective it makes sense.  But looking at it from a purely soccer standpoint he should be protected over Creavalle no doubt.
tfc,2op4uq,jztrumpeter,10,Tue Dec 9 01:18:55 2014 UTC,Not protecting Oduro is a travesty.  A speedy winger who can actually chase down the long balls we end up kicking.
tfc,2op4uq,LightsCameraRegret,7,Mon Dec 8 23:47:30 2014 UTC,His salary might protect him a bit as he's on a pretty hefty cap hit. I think the bigger travesty is not protecting Bloom.
tfc,2op4uq,errboi,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:13:27 2014 UTC,"I think it's a gamble on his salary putting teams off.  He's fast, but that's about it. I'd be shocked if a team picked him."
tfc,2op4uq,a_lumberjack,3,Tue Dec 9 22:06:55 2014 UTC,"The protected players are: Jermain Defoe, Gilberto, Luke Moore, Jonathan Osorio, Michael Bradley, Collen Warner, Justin Morrow, Nick Hagglund, Joe Bendik, Kyle Bekker and Warren Creavalle.  TFC’s six homegrown players, Quillan Roberts, Jordan Hamilton, Ashtone Morgan, Chris Mannella, Marco Delgado and Manny Aparicio, are also protected from the expansion draft.  The Reds will leave six players exposed. Those players are: Jackson, Dominic Oduro, Mark Bloom, Steven Caldwell, Chris Konopka and Daniel Lovitz.   I'd love for someone to explain to me why the likes of Moore/Warner/Bekker were protected in favour of Oduro/Bloom/Caldwell."
tfc,2op4uq,LightsCameraRegret,3,Mon Dec 8 23:39:43 2014 UTC,"We're banking on no team wanting to sign an extremely old CB.  Probably won't work out well for us.  Also, protecting Creavalle is something I did not see coming."
tfc,2op4uq,ScreamingGerman,2,Mon Dec 8 23:49:32 2014 UTC,"We could use an improvement over Caldwell, I would say. But I can't help but think it's a little disrespectful to him.  I think Creavalle can be a solid contributor in both midfield and at RB, and he's pretty young still."
tfc,2op4uq,a_lumberjack,1 point,Mon Dec 8 23:53:31 2014 UTC,"I mean, he's our captain...that should mean something. Certainly more than Creavalle."
tfc,2op4uq,errboi,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:09:37 2014 UTC,"I'm sure they explained the situation, and why it's a calculated risk. Odds are very slim anyone takes on that contract."
tfc,2op4uq,Bdog5,2,Tue Dec 9 16:50:29 2014 UTC,"An extremely old, extremely expensive CB. Plus Orlando already signed Collin from SKC today."
tfc,2op4uq,Menessy27,3,Tue Dec 9 00:14:58 2014 UTC,"Unless Bloom told them that he's going back to florida I have no idea why he's not protected. Caldwell still has a good year or two I'd say so hopefully no one takes him.  Sucks to see Oduro possibly go, he was inconsistent but had some really good games."
tfc,2op4uq,Makelevi,2,Tue Dec 9 01:44:02 2014 UTC,"For me the only move I would have changed is protecting Bloom instead of Warner as we're so thin at right back. Everything else seems pretty logical. Lovitz and Caldwell are unlikely to get picked up, and I think TFC are hoping one of Oduro or Jackson gets picked up as ideally we'd bring in a better winger with the 250k that they both make."
tfc,2op4uq,errboi,1 point,Tue Dec 9 01:31:59 2014 UTC,Bloom and Caldwell left exposed? What!?  It's like we have a running history of disrespect our team captains. Good times.
tfc,2op4uq,TorontoFC15,2,Mon Dec 8 23:45:56 2014 UTC,Caldwell is in the twilight of his career and is making close to DP wages. Who is going to take him?
tfc,2op4uq,Makelevi,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:13:54 2014 UTC,Especially with the huge defensive boost Orlando got today.
tfc,2op4uq,errboi,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:43:58 2014 UTC,"Actually yeah, on thinking about it - plus with him taking an International Slot - he's unlikely to go anywhere.  Still rattled about Bloom though. And protecting Creavalle/Warren over Lovitz."
tfc,2op4uq,TorontoFC15,3,Tue Dec 9 00:48:32 2014 UTC,"I don't think Lovitz is going to be on anyone's radar. Much better attacking options left available by other teams. I can maybe see Bloom being taken, but I won't be surprised if TFC don't lose any players."
tfc,2op4uq,errboi,1 point,Tue Dec 9 01:12:30 2014 UTC,Bloom should really come unsurprising. Yes I love him and he's going to be a great player but with his wife and kid in Florida and him being so far away it's really not surprising if he ends up there.
tfc,2op4uq,a_lumberjack,2,Tue Dec 9 00:58:24 2014 UTC,"Right, but in that case why not just trade him to Orlando and get something out of it?"
tfc,2op4uq,Menessy27,1 point,Tue Dec 9 01:11:38 2014 UTC,"You're assuming they didn't try. He's not an all star, so why would OCSC give up an asset? There will be other good defenders out there."
tfc,2op4uq,Makelevi,1 point,Tue Dec 9 22:04:40 2014 UTC,Have you seen the number of proven MLS CBs there are available every offseason? Borchers and Collin have already moved and the season only ended yesterday. Even if he does move it's really not that hard to get a replacement for some allocation. Chad Marshall was defender of the year in 2014 and Seattle got him for some allocation and a 2nd round pick.

tfc,2o5rka,errboi,2,Wed Dec 3 17:10:24 2014 UTC,"Dike's salary was pretty low IIRC, I'm surprised we're not keeping him for depth.  Maybe the FO has just decided to cut their losses if he keeps getting injured?"

tfc,2o5rka,errboi,2,Wed Dec 3 22:48:24 2014 UTC,I guess maybe he just ran out of option years and so they are renegotiating but they haven't hammered out a deal yet. Who knows at this point?
tfc,2o5rka,notdarren,2,Wed Dec 3 19:27:16 2014 UTC,"I personally hope to see Bloom back.  I think he did pretty well for his wages, and if anything will be great as depth.  He can hold his own and seems to only be improving.  I also can't remember any big mistakes by him."
tfc,2o5rka,errboi,1 point,Wed Dec 3 19:08:13 2014 UTC,Well they picked up his option so he likely will be unless they trade/lose him in the expansion draft. I think it would be silly not to protect him in the draft though as we've got very little depth at RB.
tfc,2o5rka,ScreamingGerman,1 point,Sat Dec 6 11:58:44 2014 UTC,Would be nice to get Orr back. See ya DeRo.
tfc,2o5rka,PgAero,6,Wed Dec 3 15:55:17 2014 UTC,I've got a wholly different opinion on Orr. Watching him play gives me heart palpitations. His number one modus operandi is booting the ball far left and hoping someone runs across the field for it. He always had the option to pass down right when it's open and absolutely refuses to use the players around him unless he's in trouble being chased down.
tfc,2o5rka,notdarren,5,Wed Dec 3 16:01:18 2014 UTC,"I agree completely.  He should have been our veteran CB back up that we could rely on when Caldwell was injured, but he proved to be a liability on both sides of the ball."
tfc,2o5rka,errboi,2,Wed Dec 3 16:35:25 2014 UTC,There's a reason he hasn't really had a club in the last few years.    Since his time at Bristol he hasn't really made many appearances.   2004–2010 Bristol City    229 2010–2012 Queens Park Rangers 39 2012– Blackburn Rovers    31 2012–2013 → Ipswich Town (loan) 13 2013–2014 → Blackpool (loan)    4 2014– → Toronto FC (loan)   19
tfc,2o5rka,notdarren,3,Wed Dec 3 16:38:16 2014 UTC,"to be fair, 31 appearances at Blackburn in 1 year suggests he got plenty of playing time for them. 31 appearances over 3-4 years might be something to worry about, but not 31 in 1."
tfc,2o5rka,fuzz_boy,1 point,Wed Dec 3 17:08:35 2014 UTC,"That is true, but I took the fact that they loaned him out a couple times after as a sign that he didn't play well in that time.  I could be wrong.  I really didn't even know the guy existed before he came here.  Which usually can be a good thing or a bad things.  He hasn't done anything exceptionally bad, but hasn't done anything exceptionally well."
tfc,2o5rka,Makelevi,2,Wed Dec 3 19:06:41 2014 UTC,"I don't mind seeing DeRo leave again. I thought he was a jerk last time he left and he didn't do much this past season.    He was pretty good in the Tottenham friendly, I will admit that."

tfc,2nxhdt,warpus,1 point,Mon Dec 1 17:21:41 2014 UTC,Umm... I think it may have been. I remember there being an incident with a railing in the stands being pulled up as well at that game.
tfc,2nxhdt,FGC1994,0,Mon Dec 1 19:56:28 2014 UTC,"TFC fans actually do this? For some reason I had the ignorant idea that Canadian supporters were actually ""hardcore"".  This gets me hyped up to become a more active TFC supporter and go on the trips."
tfc,2nxhdt,warpus,2,Mon Dec 1 19:54:56 2014 UTC,"That sort of behaviour would definitely not be condoned by most TFC supporters..  I could be wrong, but I think what happened was somebody threw a flare on top of a large tarp that was covering a part of the stadium..  or something similar.  I just wasn't sure if that was the game or not.  If so, it's the only thing I remember about it.  (I didn't go, but I wanted to..  but then decided that going to Columbus wasn't really going to do it for me.)"
tfc,2nxhdt,fuzz_boy,1 point,Mon Dec 1 20:44:59 2014 UTC,"The first year was ok... in terms of how TFC people acted, it wasn't perfect but it wasn't as bad as the following year. That was when people ripped up the stadium and they had the cops come and mace people."
tfc,2nw0lk,TorontoFC15,3,Mon Dec 1 00:03:18 2014 UTC,"Some important notes from the article include:  Jamaican U17 and U20, One of the most talented players on the squad, spent time with Spanish clubs like Valencia and Levante, might be going straight to our USL team, if he continues development the way he has he should be ready to take the next step in no time.   Honestly this kid is raw and just hype right now, he could be something special. He's developing into more of a winger but started as a striker."
tfc,2nsub2,youppledopp,6,Sun Nov 30 00:12:21 2014 UTC,I'm not against it.  I'm just not sure what the point would be.  What would a general toronto sports subreddit accomplish that individual team subreddits don't?
tfc,2nsub2,jztrumpeter,1 point,Sun Nov 30 02:13:51 2014 UTC,The individual subreddits are small. Put to gather there might be more discussion. Also some people aren't hardcore fans but are general toronto sports fans..

Your ticket Rep will contact you in time, but you can always email or call them with  your questions.  Those who have had their tickets longer get to pick before newer holders.  Previously, you would get contacted with the time for your reallocation. You go, you get a number based on when you bought your tickets. You went out and saw the seats that were available. You picked the seats you wanted to change to(if someone else in your group wanted the same seats you compare numbers, lowest wins). If all goes well you find something you like and take it to the reps who change your seats. If the new ones are more expensive you pay the difference, if they are cheaper you get money back."

tfc,2mskgj,MetalHeadCrow,3,Wed Nov 19 18:28:09 2014 UTC,There is no evidence this management flips players in the same way past management did.   11 players   Bradley Osorio  Bendik Hagglund Gilberto Delgado Jackson Morrow Bloom Warner Lovitz   Protecting players in the expansion draft is as much about gambling on who the teams won't pick as it is protecting who you like.   That said there isn't much there for the teams to grab.
tfc,2mskgj,Agueroooooooooo,1 point,Wed Nov 19 23:55:43 2014 UTC,I'd leave Jackson and Warner both unprotected. I doubt anyone is all that interested and even if they are taken neither would be a huge loss to us. I'd say protect Quillian Roberts (since I think he's on his second contract with us) and maybe Dike.
tfc,2mskgj,errboi,1 point,Thu Nov 20 04:47:52 2014 UTC,"Excellent list to start from. I say drop Jackson (proven to be ineffective) and Delgado (not much to go on) and add Caldwell and Bekker. Unlikely Caldwell will be poached, but without him TFC will need 2 quality CBs. Bekker was coming around nicely at the end of the season and deserves some loyalty."
tfc,2mskgj,mdps,1 point,Thu Nov 20 04:50:37 2014 UTC,"I think they should definitely drop Jackson, he sucks. They MUST have Defoe on that list, or some team would of just gotten 10m richer. I haven't heard much about Delgado, so I'm unsure about that with Bekker, who I think isn't very good. Inconsistent performer"
tfc,2mskgj,omfgkevin,1 point,Wed Nov 26 06:20:34 2014 UTC,"You are correct. I mistakenly thought the expansion draft was in January, at which point I presume Defoe will be gone."
tfc,2mskgj,mdps,1 point,Wed Nov 26 17:39:04 2014 UTC,Defoe because he is an easy 10 million dollars for who ever had him January 1st.
tfc,2mskgj,K00PER,3,Sun Nov 23 03:26:19 2014 UTC,Not Jackson.
tfc,2mskgj,Barthez_Battalion,1 point,Thu Nov 20 00:45:14 2014 UTC,So the expansion draft is December 10th so if TFC wants to protect their 10 million dollar investment in Defoe we have to protect him and risk another player or TFC will lose their money. It is an easy pick up for either team. New York might be able to convince him to stay or either team could pick him and sell him on to QPR. They should have let him go August 31st.
tfc,2mskgj,K00PER,1 point,Sun Nov 23 03:24:47 2014 UTC,"This will sound negative, but I don't think it really even matters at this point.  We trade/sell players and bring in new people so much that I am doubtful of us keeping any one I like. That said I hope we can keep Jackson and Oduro."
tfc,2mskgj,notdarren,2,Wed Nov 19 21:44:02 2014 UTC,Really? Do you have a thing for fast guys who either have no first touch or can't pass?

tfc,2mskgj,notdarren,1 point,Thu Nov 20 11:54:01 2014 UTC,He'd get more assists if he could control the ball. He is not able to hold up play while his teammates catch up to him.
tfc,2mskgj,mdps,2,Thu Nov 20 13:34:26 2014 UTC,"I'm not saying he doesn't have flaws, I'm just saying he can create a chance more than other people seem to be able to.  Until someone gets more assists than him I'd choose him over any of our other wingers.   Plus, I'm like 99% sure he's not even naturally a winger, he was just playing there.  In Fifa and his Wiki is says Striker.  So maybe he'll learn to play the winger position better, who knows."

tfc,2mpx0f,nodoubtguy,1 point,Wed Nov 19 14:22:49 2014 UTC,I'm assuming that all new ticket deposits and the public on sales will select specific sections and seats only after the STH relocation....right?
tfc,2mpx0f,Jsikrtanc,2,Wed Nov 19 15:54:44 2014 UTC,The relocation will be in February. The locations we are on sale with right now were either available last year or in the new areas. All of the Supporters and Light greys are being held for relocation.

tfc,2mpx0f,ExProxy,0,Thu Nov 20 16:46:42 2014 UTC,"Just got my seasons right beside Kings in the North!  If you are looking into the supporter sections I suggest checking out their pages. They usually regulate all their relocations and can help you out a lot more.  A lot of the sections are filling up, I had a few choices in for my seats and LUCKILY I still got besides the KitN.  Relocating is easy, they are going to sell newcomers seats while reserving past season holder, then after all the newcomers seats are sold, all previous holders have renewed any that are A) still open, B)cancelled C)not renewed. Those are all available for the relocations, previous holders go first, new holders 2nd and public 3rd."

tfc,2m0s6q,fuzz_boy,5,Wed Nov 12 02:55:24 2014 UTC,"Vanney is correct in his evaluation, in my opinion.  No team fields the exact same roster year to year, especially ones that miss the playoffs. That said, I'm pretty sure Tim B recently said in an interview that he intends to keep a level of continuity with returning players and that we will build off players we acquired last year (Oduro, Moore, Creavalle, etc...).  Hopefully we can acquire another depth defender in the Chivas dispersal draft. I'm not too familiar with their roster though, I'm not sure how realistic that is.  We'll need a replacement for Defoe should he choose to jump ship.  We need a better option to play on the left wing than Jackson/Lovitz/Osorio. I wouldn't be opposed to keeping Jackson around but last years incarnation of him can be improved upon.  Lastly, Michael Bradley is not the droid CAM we're looking for. I hope we switch to a 4-4-2 Diamond and acquire someone more creative to play in front of him.  If the MLS wants to expand to 4 DP's per team, we could absolutely use a superstar CB too. But beyond that, I think we can be a successful team next season largely on the roster we currently have.  That and we need a better coach, but I didn't expect Vanney to concede that."
tfc,2lv6oi,logan1111,8,Mon Nov 10 15:38:37 2014 UTC,"TFC needs to improve the defense, but not the GK. Bendik has single-handedly stolen points for us the past two seasons. His long distribution is atrocious, but more often than not he'll pass/throw it short these days, so that's becoming less of an issue."
tfc,2lv6oi,errboi,5,Mon Nov 10 15:42:31 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the fact that Bendik still manages to look good any portion of the time while the defenders constantly leave him exposed speaks volumes about his skill. He's more than suitable for MLS."
tfc,2lv6oi,sa-rpb,3,Mon Nov 10 15:54:12 2014 UTC,Completely agree here.  It is the defense before it gets to Bendik that is the issue.  They need to work on that.

tfc,2ln887,zGOLASO,8,Sat Nov 8 03:40:04 2014 UTC,That sucks. Did they offer you different seats as a replacement?
tfc,2ln887,Banach-Tarski,3,Sat Nov 8 05:15:13 2014 UTC,Yeah they offered me first choice to the new seats or any season seat that isn't being renewed which isn't too bad but it's still a shame
tfc,2ln887,errboi,3,Sat Nov 8 16:08:53 2014 UTC,The good news (if you can call it good news) is that there will probably be a fair number of people that don't renew thanks to the downward spiral that was this season. You might get pretty decent seats out of it. Sucks that you lost your old ones though :(
tfc,2ln887,mdps,2,Sat Nov 8 21:42:46 2014 UTC,I'd expect they'll offer OP a choice of seats in an equivalently-priced area. In the order in which he or she became a member of the club.

tfc,2ln887,Auth3nticRory,2,Sat Nov 8 12:15:59 2014 UTC,"So they basically said that we would have first choice to the new seats in any location which would probably be worse than my current seats (108, row 20) or any other season seats from people who do not renew.

tfc,2ln887,mdps,2,Sat Nov 8 16:07:49 2014 UTC,this happens all the time with stadium expansions.  they'll usually offer you a very good comparable and a concession card or something.

tfc,2lj6n9,Lighnix,3,Fri Nov 7 16:33:54 2014 UTC,"As a galatasaray fan, I just want to set this straight. Sneijder is an amazing player, and if he were to magically come to TFC he would have a bigger impact then any big signing in the past.  However, he's still a very important player for Galatasaray and definitely one of their best players. Just check out /r/Galatasaray if you want more proof."

Not saying I wouldn't love to see him in Toronto, but the guy has been with Liverpool (academy system) since 1987, literally his entire career. He's been the captain for over a decade.   I suppose a plus for him would be he's still a Red... right?"

Chad Marshall was one of the best defenders in MLS this season and Seattle got him for allocation and a 3rd round pick. TFC will likely have a ton of allocation from the Laba trade and the Defoe sale, and 3 first round draft picks this year. It's really not that hard to trade for a defender."

tfc,2lavnj,wideawakeairfield,1 point,Wed Nov 5 20:20:32 2014 UTC,I think the fan reaction is enough to show why Defoe would jump on a plane back to England. We had a top striker and the way the fans have treated him has been shocking.
tfc,2lavnj,ScreamingGerman,2,Wed Nov 5 16:39:14 2014 UTC,"Is it really that shocking though?  Our club goes out of it's way to bring him here, over paying for him, making a huge deal of him coming here and telling the city and fans it's a ""bloody big deal"".    He gets here and is treated extremely well by the fans, we cheered him and celebrated his goals and were very happy to have him but then somewhere along the way he decided that 6 months was enough time to spend here and started shopping himself around.  We are rightfully hurt by this. Why didn't he give us one single conflict free season before leaving? Why didn't he come out right away when the rumours came out and say ""I'm totally committed to Toronto and this season."".  He didn't, it took almost a week before he bothered to acknowledge us.   I blame a lot of this on Leiweke. He was the one that got him here and at the same time was not denying the rumours of him leaving, so I get why this happened but you can't blame us for being upset it did happen.   I wish things had worked out differently but if Defoe jumps back to England then that's fine but he better not expect us to treat his mercenary attitude to make him a club legend.  Personally I'll be tossing his name on the pile with DeGuzman, Laurent Robert and Mista, the ""oh yeah, those guys played for us"" pile.  /rant"

There’s always an ability to mutually change contracts and do things. You have a conversation and you make sure your goals are aligned, and if they’re not then you discuss options from there.”   I was mad in August when he was so quick to leave the club because his friend, the coach, was fired. I just want the cancer out of the dressing room. Glad to hear the club is already going after his replacement.   Leiweke, whose term as president and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment is slated to end by next June, went so far as to say Plan B is already drawn up. And he went even further. “We know where we are going. If we have a DP (designated player) slot open, we already know who we’re going after. And I am 100 per cent convinced we’re going to be a better team on the pitch next year — without a lot of changes. “We need some consistency and we need a core group and a core value system here.

tfc,2kokm9,StJohnsFog,6,Wed Oct 29 16:27:38 2014 UTC,"I honestly feel like this guy knows what he is talking about. I feel like Vanney is way better than Nelsen. I can't help but feel like he has the knowledge and the vision to be a great coach.  I just struggle, and am worried, about him learning how to do it with us. Does anyone else agree? He talks and he is clearly an intelligent guy who understands the game. But god damn it why couldn't he come in with a few years of experience under his belt."
tfc,2kokm9,Matt872000,2,Wed Oct 29 17:00:37 2014 UTC,"He does seem intellectually up to the job, and we'll really only see his ability coming up this next season. (I know his record sucks so far, but Bez does have a tiny bit of a point in what he was saying.)"
tfc,2kokm9,StJohnsFog,2,Wed Oct 29 17:02:32 2014 UTC,"I missed Bez's portion, can you elaborate?"
tfc,2kokm9,Matt872000,2,Wed Oct 29 17:03:32 2014 UTC,Bez was saying that it was completely unfair to judge Vanney on his ability with only the last few games of the season because Defoe was injured and Vanney had barely any time (no time before the first two games) before he had to face matches.
tfc,2kokm9,StJohnsFog,2,Wed Oct 29 17:04:55 2014 UTC,"Bez isn't wrong.  I'm fine giving Vanney some time, I'd LOVE if he turns out to be a gun. It would hurt so much though if he is another Nelsen. He just doesn't sound it though. He SOUNDS like he can fit the bill. I hope so."
tfc,2kokm9,section111,3,Wed Oct 29 17:06:37 2014 UTC,"I, on the other hand, danced with my eyes closed to every single song that Nelsen was singing. I thought he had the winning mentality, the experience playing on the big stage, the man management, the intelligence, the portfolio of success as a player, the references, the sense of humour and the physicality of the perfect coach. He didn't have experience, no doubt, but literally every single winning coach had to start somewhere. And if not this stupid place, where else?   I still think firing him undid our chances this year. I only mention it because you asked, but I'm now over it. It did take me a while, I have to admit, but now I'm looking forward, not back."
tfc,2kokm9,StJohnsFog,5,Wed Oct 29 17:45:35 2014 UTC,"I actually really feel the same way.  I was a Nelsen apologist for a long time. I didn't start getting frustrated until July, and he was fired shortly after. I have the same thoughts as you: every winning coach starts somewhere. I'd love to have TFC find the next Jason Kreis. I'd love for it to be Vanney.   Nelsen had the personal character, the calmness, the references, and the loyalty to the players that I would expect from the coach but I never heard him talk tactics, or analyse problems with the team intelligently in front of the camera. Too often I heard him talk about hard calls and tough luck. Vanney seems to have the character and calmness of Nelsen, but seems more comfortably talking tactics. He sounds more like he knows what he is talking about, but probably doesn't have the Rolodex. We used Nelsen's Rolodex to build the team this year, I'm hoping we can use Vanney's knowledge to sharpen the team next year."
tfc,2kokm9,section111,2,Wed Oct 29 19:07:16 2014 UTC,"tactics    You make an excellent point, and it's definitely a blind spot for me. I've played the game seriously for 30+ years - like, a lot; it's really the major thing in my life - but I've never really understood tactics (it definitely helps that I'm a goalkeeper). So when people said he was tactically unsound, I'd sort of shrug. I suppose I was hoping that he was fine, and that the other stuff would count for more anyway.   And you're right, if he didn't have that side sorted, the Rolodex was only ever going to get us so far."
tfc,2kokm9,Matt872000,3,Wed Oct 29 19:26:01 2014 UTC,"Straight to questions for Bez, at least he's being forward."
tfc,2kokm9,LightsCameraRegret,3,Wed Oct 29 15:37:20 2014 UTC,Apparently Bez has not talked with the club that bought Henry back in April. How can you sell a player and not discuss it with the club?

tfc,2kokm9,LightsCameraRegret,2,Wed Oct 29 16:10:41 2014 UTC,"Wording is crap, but I think I get it. Getting record results is a sign that the squad is moving in the right direction.  But those results were not coming as a result of a blueprint or execution, but as a result of moments of brilliance from players.  Varney talking about crossing was more insight than anything Nelsen ever said. It's one thing to have talent, it's another to maximize that talent. Vanney seems to be a guy who can do that."

tfc,2kmfxa,denMAR,3,Wed Oct 29 03:24:28 2014 UTC,Exactly - just the marketing alone is more than likely worth it in the eyes of MLSE. Think of the shirt sales.
tfc,2kmfxa,errboi,2,Wed Oct 29 04:33:01 2014 UTC,Screw the marketing. MLSE makes too many decisions based on how marketable they might be. They need to just realize that winning is the most marketable thing they could do. People would love to see a team that wins.
tfc,2kmfxa,section111,2,Thu Oct 30 00:27:48 2014 UTC,"Well, yes, screw the marketing, maybe. But remember when he came and scored the equalizer and then Gilberto's winner was called back? Bradley et. al. were swarming the ref and basically losing their absolute shit - which was fair - when they pulled De Ro over for an interview and do you remember what he said? He was angry, fired up, sure, but he said, and I paraphrase, 'I just want to say, to all the kids watching, that right there is why you never, ever give up.' I thought it was an incredible moment, and just as good for the club - probably better, as it turned out - as his goal."
tfc,2kmfxa,jztrumpeter,9,Thu Oct 30 17:28:08 2014 UTC,"Are you serious?  Every time he got on the pitch our entire offense upped the tempo. He held the ball well, helped direct forward play for us, and was actually building attacks into the box."
tfc,2kmfxa,mdps,5,Wed Oct 29 02:25:59 2014 UTC,I wouldn't say every time. He was not nearly as consistent as he used to be.
tfc,2kmfxa,glyphic_,2,Wed Oct 29 02:40:00 2014 UTC,I agree that he wasn't that great in many games. But I think Vanney used him more effectively than Nelson did. I'm optimistic that he has another season in him. And let's face it; the fans love him.
tfc,2kmfxa,mdps,2,Wed Oct 29 03:05:10 2014 UTC,Vanney used him much more effectively than Nelson. That's one of the reasons why I'm actually not too worried about having Vanney as a coach. His substitutions as a whole was significantly better than it was under Nelson.
tfc,2kmfxa,drretro,2,Wed Oct 29 20:14:19 2014 UTC,Agree strongly with you on the substitution point. A real weak point for Nelson. But I have little confidence in Vanney thu far. Making better subs and being known for clear communication are nice to haves. I want to see him coach TFC to a win or draw from a match against a better team. He's not done that yet.

He was the one that sold us all - Defoe included - a bill of sale. He promised this grand adventure then bailed. And just before bailing he has the nerve to question Defoe's intent because other teams are interested? Bollocks. I feel so cheated by TL.  As per Defoe, I hope he stays.

A few bad games and he became a goat, mercilessly booed by everyone in the building every time he touched the puck. In this town we eat our own apparently."

tfc,2kkj21,ScreamingGerman,6,Tue Oct 28 17:42:32 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I think a fair bit of the ""support"" for TFC might be overstated. A lot of times when I make it out to a game the people around me are talking about anything but soccer. The stuff that I do hear about soccer is a mix of either one person who has a soccer IQ telling their friends about things to teach them about the game, or people who seem to think everyone on the field should be constantly shooting the ball.  In Bradley's case I do recall yelling at my TV toward the end of the season that he should stop taking every damned set piece, but I sincerely doubt that was the guy behind you's problem with him."

This was during the very long Leafs period where management seemed to feel they could pair any scrubs with Sundin and he would magically make them seem like good hockey players. To a point it actually worked but he would've done even better had he been paired with actual talent.

For a shitty rumour from a shitty tabloid. It's ludicrous how fast they turned around on him.   The best player we've ever had and we throw him under the bus because of typical English rumours surrounding deadline day. We're fucking amateurs."

He was unreal when he was on the field for us and healthy. He played two years straight, it makes sense that he was hurting at the end of the season. If we get him back next year, rested and healthy and training with us for the entire pre-season... holy shit.   Unfortunately at this point I don't know if it will happen."

tfc,2khd7w,TorontoFC15,2,Tue Oct 28 19:57:27 2014 UTC,The idea of Bob Bradley coming over has been floating around for a while now. It's a nice idea but I doubt it will actually happen. We are most likely stuck with Vanney for the next season or at least the first half of the season. All of this really depends on TFCs performance next year. Vanney could turn out to be the coach that we need to make the break through or just another in a long line of flops.

I feel he was a great player who creatively made several chances for others (some great backheels, flicks, dummies, etc). His problem was that he wasn't well supplied, and often had to create chances out of nothing. While it took him quite a while to find his groove (especially with an unsuccessful partnership with Defoe), I think a C+ is a harsh."

tfc,2kd58r,mdps,5,Sun Oct 26 12:30:20 2014 UTC,"I hold the opinion - apparently unpopular on this sub - that Henry is a liability to TFC. Kurtis Larson's calls him out for the NE game:   Then there’s the problem with the back four. Henry, who may or may not be back next season after being sold to a Cypriot club, was a pylon in too many instances.  He stepped forward when he should have retreated in the 71st minute when a long diagonal beat TFC’s entire back four and led to New England’s Kelyn Rowe scuttling a breakaway.  After TFC’s Luke Moore saw his header saved by Bobby Shuttleworth with a quarter-hour remaining, Henry was again the culprit on a lax defensive play that saw him misplay a tackle inside the area with five minutes remaining.  That allowed New England’s Diego Fagundez to walk in on Joe Bendik before putting his effort wide of frame, cementing the final scoreline at 1-0."

tfc,2kc2nt,mongo5mash,1 point,Mon Oct 27 01:02:04 2014 UTC,"Being the sign that MLSE really doesn't know what they're doing. It's been that way since day one, but even with the investment this year, they've shown that they are horrible owners that just don't get it.   Throwing money at the problem didn't fix it. They still sacked the coach that had them sitting pretty after a poor injury riddled run. They still stamped the terrible, short-sighted deal that had Issey leave for Warner (which was horribly pessimistic - no trust for Osorio commanding the midfield?)  I know it isn't going to happen, especially not with the lego fortress growing, but holy fuck do we need the head chopped off this rotten fish. Find an ownership group that cares about the game, that understands it.   At this point, mlse has thrown all they have at it, even digging deep to make some good signings. But it's proven to not be enough. Fuck is this depressing.   As an aside, this is the season in which poor officiating has cost us the most, as we lost crucial points due to numbskull calls."

And here he is saying he's been struggling with an injury all year and he is hurt that people are questioning his commitment when he wanted to push into the playoffs. He also mentioned that he is used to transfer speculation and didn't think it was as big of a deal as it ended up being.  Is it possible that his commitment is now in jeopardy because fans have been going at him so hard since September? I know I fucking loved watching him the start of the season, and we are better when he plays. What does it take for Defoe to get back into our good graces? I'd love for him to play at TFC next year, and maybe I'm wearing rose-tinted glasses, but from what I'm reading here he is essentially saying ""hey guys, I really am not looking to leave, stop saying I'm not committed.""  Then every comment here is GTFO.  All things equal, I personally want Defoe here. When he is good, he is one of the best goal scorers in the league."
tfc,2k4asn,StJohnsFog,1 point,Fri Oct 24 11:44:11 2014 UTC,"I think if he does come back next season that will prove one thing and if he puts in the effort that he clearly can he can regain the fans' love.   I know it seems really harsh but being a DP there are pretty big expectations to meet and if he doesn't meet those, because of injury or passion or skill or fitness, then the team can't really justify spending all that money on him. It's really the same in Europe. If a team splashes out major transfer money or salary there is always going to be pressure on them.  It's true that possibly fans have been too harsh in judging his commitment but like I said, the best way to get it back would be just to stay on next season and prove that commitment on the field or in the community."

Morrow is vastly better, and infinitely more consistent.  TFC is in a better place than it's been in a while. Solid squad, actual selection dilemmas, finally producing goals. Still a negative GD, still failure to close out results, but the building blocks are there.  If we can rid ourselves of the distraction that is Defoe, bring in a DP who can play as a second striker, including the ability to link play and create, that'll solidify some gaps.

tfc,2jmwe1,TorontoFC15,6,Sat Oct 18 22:35:22 2014 UTC,"Today was my second mls game. I sat in supporter section 127, and I felt the tension of rivalry between the TFC fans and Impact fans right above us (those with the banners). There was a time when it got pretty heated (looks like when the banner was shown, just seconds before first red card) and security had to be deployed. A family with small children near us left for fear of possible riot. The fact that the ref lost control and issued 2 more red cards didn't help at all. But it ended pretty civil after the game.    It's cool that I could see Bradley and Hagglund in club boxes too."

Osorio pushed Felipe after the ball was gone, yellow card worthy, but not red.    the second yellow seemed quite justified, but the ref had lost it by then."
tfc,2jmwe1,feb914,3,Sun Oct 19 01:45:12 2014 UTC,"Sorry, you're new here. Toledo averages a red card every three matches. Guy is a joke.  Pretty sure Osorio kicked him. Ah well."

It is the home stadium of the Borussia Dortmund football team playing in the German Bundesliga.  The stadium is officially named Signal Iduna Park [zɪɡˈnaːl ʔɪˈduːna ˈpaʁk] under a sponsorship arrangement lasting from December 2005 until 2021,  giving naming rights to the Signal Iduna Group, an insurance company. The older name Westfalenstadion derives from the former Prussian province of Westphalia, which is part of the German federal state North Rhine-Westphalia. It is one of the most famous football stadiums in Europe and was elected best football stadium by The Times for its renowned atmosphere.   It has a league capacity of 80,720 (standing and seated) and an international capacity of 65,718 (officially seats only).    It is Germany's biggest stadium and the seventh biggest stadium in Europe, as well as the third-largest stadium home to a top-flight European club (behind only Camp Nou and the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu). The stadium established the European record in average fan attendance in 2004–2005 with a total of 1.354 million fans. The stadium broke this record in the 2011–2012 season with almost 1.37 million spectators.  Sales of annual season tickets exceed 50,000. The Südtribüne (South Bank) is the largest extant terrace for standing spectators in European football; it is regularly full to its 24,454 capacity.   Famous for the intense atmosphere it breeds, the south terrace has been nicknamed ""Yellow Wall"".  The Borusseum, the museum of Borussia Dortmund, is located inside the stadium.

tfc,2jmt0g,errboi,3,Sat Oct 18 20:20:28 2014 UTC,If Bradley can find even a balance between his first half of the season performances and the second half of the season performances that would be a very solid pick up.
tfc,2jmt0g,BasedPython,2,Sat Oct 18 20:59:14 2014 UTC,Maybe we should use him more as a defensive mid instead of pulling a Klinsmann.

If he's going to the right place where he'll have playing time and better coaching then I'm happy as a CMNT fan. As a TFC fan... ugh. I want him to stay because if he can develop into the player I think he can be then he'd be a god in our back line.
tfc,2jj1r2,errboi,0,Sat Oct 18 03:03:18 2014 UTC,"I think Henry has proven that he won't develop into the player he can be. Blame him, coaches, or the organization? I don't know. But he's had his chances and he keeps making amateurish mistakes."
tfc,2jj1r2,mdps,1 point,Mon Oct 20 21:00:20 2014 UTC,He's what? 20 years old? 21? He's got so much developmental time left that it's probably premature to say he's proven he won't develop.

tfc,2jj1r2,mdps,1 point,Tue Oct 21 00:54:11 2014 UTC,"I don't know if I'd say he leapfrogged him.

tfc,2j4e44,Barthez_Battalion,6,Mon Oct 13 15:20:43 2014 UTC,"Honestly, when it came to the whole Laba thing, would you have passed on Bradley in order to keep Laba? Laba was my favourite player last season, and I was upset by the fact he did leave, but saying that, I see why TFC had no choice but to let him go. I'm still waiting to fully judge this deal on the whole ""Future considerations"" thing, but as far as I see it, it was a choice of Bradley or Laba, and I can see why they made the decision they did.  The Issey trade on the other hand was damn right stupid."
tfc,2j4e44,red_gamble,2,Mon Oct 13 17:33:52 2014 UTC,Couldn't agree more. Last year we couldn't score so we went with 2 DPS who are attackers. Then the Bradley opportunity comes up and you cannot turn that down. Laba is good but he isn't Bradley.
tfc,2j4e44,Cuj0XXX,6,Mon Oct 13 19:24:44 2014 UTC,Trading Issey for Warner was stupid. And the Laba thing could have perhaps been resolved. But supposedly Nelsen didn't think he needed him.
tfc,2j4e44,3andahalfMB,7,Mon Oct 13 15:23:38 2014 UTC,We couldn't have held on to Laba with 3 incoming DPs on our roster already.  That's why he was traded.
tfc,2j4e44,warpus,6,Mon Oct 13 18:16:21 2014 UTC,"We made some good deals this year, but I still have no idea why the Issey trade happened. Absolutely terrible deal."
tfc,2j4e44,CrashingForeignCars,2,Mon Oct 13 15:56:25 2014 UTC,"I think the Issey thing happened because the got scared with Bradley going away for USMNT duty. They brought in Warner who plays a similar style to Bradley, but is much much worse, and then couldn't use him anyway because of cup matches and injuries or something. Then they insisted on using him beside Bradley after the WC and that was just a disaster but oh well. TFC gonna TFC."

We all liked him, he was playing well, and I remember how pissed off it made us. tbh I don't even like Warner.  I like the Oduro trade but Oduro is pretty inconsistent and sometimes useless. He has had amazing games but not enough of them.  I haven't been paying a whole lot of attention to Laba but is there a chance we can get him back if Defoe leaves?"
tfc,2j4e44,Bdog5,3,Mon Oct 13 18:29:19 2014 UTC,The Oduro trade was a masterstroke for the simple that that Rey then left the league about a month later on a free transfer. Now we at least have a bargaining chip still.

They were.. mad. But they were also funny with their jeers because the Crew guys were literally warming up right in front of us (my friend and I) and with me in an autographed Crew jersey they could tell I was a supporter but they aren't allowed to acknowledge me so some guy kept asking and making fun of them for not acknowledging someone driving 8 hours from Columbus to support them.

However given that this is Toronto sports fans, I'm not overly surprised either. I've posted elsewhere on this sub that I think a 3-5-2 is a more suitable formation for the types of players we have.

tfc,2j0bsc,torontotony,2,Sun Oct 12 17:26:11 2014 UTC,"This team had so much more potential than what the results show. Fact is Nelson was not the right man for the job, nor is Vanney. An experienced coach won't do anything but improve TFC's chances of making the playoffs (next year) and maybe even take all the gold. Truth is, this team aside from Bradley and Defoe, lacks creativity, cohesiveness, and talent. Defense is virtually non-existent (again), mid-fielders do not support Bradley, and aside from Defoe no one has the capability to finish up front. Bendik doesn't get a pass either."

tfc,2irgwi,xeneize,3,Sun Oct 12 01:12:38 2014 UTC,Defoe has to go its a must. on another note I like Dike but Urruti has score 10 goal this season am not sure if Dike is a 10 goal a season striker. defense is bad but I would prefer to get a creating midfielder Bekker is just not creating enough chances perhaps Gastón Ramirez (on loan at Hull City) out of favor from Southampton still young. Jonathan De Guzmán is another option just signed a contract.
tfc,2irgwi,ElkoGroeschl,1 point,Thu Oct 9 17:35:16 2014 UTC,Urruti was a DP and Dike not--not to mention the price difference between the two.  I'd like to wait on what is decided by the team and Defoe before I pull out the pitch fork though.
tfc,2irgwi,Cuj0XXX,3,Fri Oct 10 15:40:28 2014 UTC,"Personally I do not want to see defoe leave. He is world class. When he is on, he is one of the best strikers in the league and that is going to matter as more clubs use their DP spots for attacking players (Villa, Keane, henry).   I would love to get in a manager on the long term, let him go through the thick and thin of the club and stick with him. Its hard to gel a team together with no backbone and management is the backbone. It could be literally anyone, but preferably someone who has tactical success already. (why hasnt anyone mentioned tim sherwood)  Defenders IF defoe leaves or IF a fourth dp spot comes available i think it has to be used on a defender. Someone proven who is a rock in the back and can control the back line. I like caldwell, hangs and Henry alot. however they are all prone to error, like any defender but having those three move around with a top MLS striker would be awesome. a RB is also needed, Bloom, Orr and creavelle have all had some great games there but we need someone who can play consistent and play mostly every game."
tfc,2irgwi,warpus,4,Thu Oct 9 21:48:23 2014 UTC,"No Moyes, he'd bring in all his own people who know nothing about the league.  Plus it's Moyes."

tfc,2irgwi,Cuj0XXX,1 point,Thu Oct 9 15:31:51 2014 UTC,Hey dude who i keep thinking is me how about timmy sherwood AM I RIII
tfc,2irgwi,Coramoor_,2,Thu Oct 9 23:11:05 2014 UTC,"The focus on centerbacks on this subreddit is positively absurd, we need a backup veteran CB who isn't a liability but we definitely don't need a starter at that position.  Brek Shea is a terrible idea for so many reasons and he'd demand far more money than he could ever be worth.  With our current roster, our problem areas are on the outside of the field. We have no depth in any of those 4 main positions(7 players for 4 positions). Without making significant changes, the easiest solution would be to transition to a 3-5-2 formation with a triangle center midfield consisting of Bradley Bekker and Osorio and use the wing positions as a situation thing, if you want an attacking formation, drop Osorio next to Bradley and play a 3-2-3-2 and if you want a defensive formation, drop the wingers back a bit and play more of a 3-1-2(outside)-2(inside)-2.  I suggest the 3 person defense more because of the insane athleticism of Henry and Hagglund while allowing Caldwell to be the stabilizing presence, also having 3 at the back like that would allow for a larger margin of error from both of those players as they develop.  The extra player in the midfield would also help our flow and progression issues by allowing another target in the forward direction of play instead of consistently dumping it back and resetting."
tfc,2irgwi,Cuj0XXX,1 point,Thu Oct 9 21:23:47 2014 UTC,"3-5-2 wouldn't work. I love the formation and the idea behind it but unfortunately our defenders are not consistent enough to play 3 deep. especially with oso or bekker as a dm (I fuckin love those guys but they aren't dms) it might would however as a 532 counter formation with a triangle midfeild playing Bradley as box to box deep and oso and bekker as pivot cm's (same roll you see them play in the 442) then up your pace up top with defoe and Oduro. Morrow would be a great lwb and we would need to fill the roll at RWB ( bloom, creavealle, jackson?)  Logically however I think 4231 is the formation to play in our games. like you said we need an extra medfeilder, we get dominated there. gilberto and defoe both play a great lone ST and Bekker is an amazing attacking playmaker type player, he is the type of guy to distribute the ball and take some shots in the final third, his WR going back is there but his defensive ability is not. we have a lot of players that can play on the wings (Oduro, Oso, Jackson, Lovitz all come to mind). Bradley can sit deep and control like his known to do and we can use Creavealle or Werner to play as an anchor man. So Mbrads doesnt have to pick up all the midfeild slack defensively                          Defoe/ Moore/ Gilberto       Lovitz/oso       Bekker/ Oso        JAckson/ Oduro                 Bradley               Creavealle/ Werner   Morrow        Caldwell        Hanglaand/ Henry       Bloom/ Orr/ Creavealle                          Big Joe"
tfc,2irgwi,Coramoor_,2,Thu Oct 9 22:13:07 2014 UTC,"The reason I want to play 3 at the back is Henry and Hagglund are too good to not have playing, and with Caldwell the in between pivot, it should give enough control and flexibility to clean up most messes that either one of them gets into. It also has the benefit of solving our depth problem on the wings while allowing us to play Bekker and Osorio in roles that they are more natural in.  Osorio has enough skill to play a CM pivot role with Bradley if we need a lot of pressure on the wings. We could also look for a CDM not named Warner to take over that role as well."
tfc,2irgwi,Cuj0XXX,1 point,Thu Oct 9 22:35:29 2014 UTC,"Again I think the idea is awesome, however I don't feel like the midfeild would be defensive enough to make it work. If you look at the teams who have succeeded using a 352, they always have a few certain attributes. A) Two midfeilders who play strong defensive football. B) wingers you would consider more wing backs than anything else"
tfc,2irgwi,Coramoor_,3,Thu Oct 9 22:56:03 2014 UTC,"a lot of it could depend on tactical adjustments in the game, or who you line up where, both Morrow and Bloom have decent skill attacking and crossing with the ball but are defensive players first, so it would be very possible to create a wingback filled system that is perhaps a bit more aggressive than most by relying on Hagglund and Henry's athleticism. This is especially true as we are not relying on a lone striker but 2 strikers with this formation, which offers a lot more width and a lot less dependance on hold up play."
tfc,2irgwi,Cuj0XXX,2,Thu Oct 9 22:59:58 2014 UTC,thats why the wingback 5-3-2 system would work (i know this is practically the same as 352) with some pace up top the counter attack would be so real.   P.s. have an upvote for a beautiful tactical discussion with no anger or hate messages fellow red!
tfc,2irgwi,Coramoor_,1 point,Thu Oct 9 23:10:29 2014 UTC,I feel like most people think of 5-3-2 as a bit too defensive so I'd rather not use that description although admittedly it is cleaner than my inside outside description.

tfc,2irgwi,omfgkevin,1 point,Thu Oct 9 19:46:28 2014 UTC,"Not too late now that we're out of the playoffs :(. IMO Defoe, although expensive as hell, is REALLY good. One of the super positives this year. His salary is large and we should probably do something about it, but that would make it hurt even more considering we brought them in and then had to take Laba out (who should of stayed). Defoe can score in clutch situations and if he can keep healthy, we'll be set. I would rather see Gilberto out after his poor season (less goals than Luke Moore, who is not a DP). About the CB, don't we already have Caldwell? He has been rock solid aside from his injury, which I think definitely hurt us."
tfc,2irgwi,omfgkevin,1 point,Sun Oct 12 04:06:09 2014 UTC,"Caldwell's been fine, but Hagglund and Henry have both been prone to mistakes.  We need an MLS veteran out there."
tfc,2irgwi,drretro,1 point,Sun Oct 12 13:56:43 2014 UTC,That is true. Henry gas potential but id prone to rash mistakes but i dont think throwing a dp slot there and replacing a extremely potent striket will help. Without defoe we wouldnt even be contensing. Gilberto doesnt score and moore is only decent. Neithet are 10 goal guys

tfc,2irgwi,errboi,1 point,Sun Oct 12 18:28:03 2014 UTC,I'm in complete agreement. I would like to see Defoe sold and the bulk of that revenue put into getting a coach with MLS experience. Lot of experience. As much as we can get for our money.
tfc,2irgwi,Cuj0XXX,1 point,Mon Oct 13 14:42:26 2014 UTC,"if bob is serious about coming, i am interested in having him coach. lovitz is a good player for this league. not sure exactly where to go with him yet. he's doing a great job in the attacking midfield. defoe needs to go. hopefully dike is capable of playing up to the standards it was before his leg exploded for a second time. this is a good team, we just need an experienced left or right back to help out."
tfc,2irgwi,errboi,7,Thu Oct 9 15:25:08 2014 UTC,we have an experienced left back. Morrow is one of the best left backs in the entire league.
tfc,2irgwi,warpus,3,Thu Oct 9 16:16:52 2014 UTC,He's a defender.  Most people don't know his name because he's rock solid.

I never saw Osario in a dangerous position.   Sometimes penalties are saved. That's the missed opportunity that hurts the least in my opinion. We did enough to win that game 2-1 even without the penalty. Defoe created multiple chances on his own and looked dangerous all night.  My blame isn't on Defoe (even including the penalty).

And to be honest, we've been improving in all sorts of areas these last 2 years.  So I just think it's a really stupid time to leave as a fan.  If you were going to do it, and you were here from the beginning (not you you), there were far more logical times to leave as a fan.  Call me a cynical optimist."

tfc,2ipwzp,quelar,-2,Thu Oct 9 17:14:00 2014 UTC,"I enjoy the English Premier League and after hearing good things about MLS, i decided to catch a match and the match i caught was between Galaxy and Toronto FC. I am disappointed to say the least. LA's standard would see them in the top half of the table, not in the Premier League but the Championships. As for Toronto, they would be in the League One. Here are some of my observations. First, Toronto has very very weak buildup. Possession was lost after just a few passes into the opponents' half. Second, horrid finishing. There are much opportunities but they were wasted because of lack of striker support or the striker was too blind-sighted or too selfish to give assists.   I was hoping to change my assessment of Toronto Fc with this match but sadly, all that I have said are reinforced by the performance this day. Houston, despite losing defenders to the international week, had put up a comparably better performance defensively and with constant pressing, Toronto just does not have the skills to retain possession.   I know it is unfair to compare MLS to EPL but come on, after the worlcup hype, we should be expecting teams to be doing much better than the current standard."
tfc,2ipwzp,Mercento,3,Thu Oct 9 02:34:04 2014 UTC,"well if you want Jermain Defoe to pass, you're looking at the wrong guy, he's been incredibly selfish even by striker standards his whole career(and it was quite a good one in the EPL).  Also if you want to compare a league where the average player makes 1.6 million pounds, or approximately the salary cap of MLS teams excluding DPs, then good luck with that"
tfc,2ipwzp,Coramoor_,2,Thu Oct 9 04:29:01 2014 UTC,"League One may be generous. I wonder how some of these guys are pros sometimes. It's simple economics though. The salary cap in MLS is $3 million, the play reflects that."
tfc,2ipwzp,danoo,1 point,Thu Oct 9 05:31:42 2014 UTC,"Indeed. That is why the cap must go. The argument for the cap says that MLS is currently operating at a deficit and cap is there to keep the cost low. Sure MLS as a league is losing money but the cap is on the teams. Pray tell how limiting spendings on a club help to limit the cost to the MLS league as a competition?! (not railing at you danoo). If you allow clubs to invest as much as they want (for now), then you will more likely to have competitive teams that play beautiful football. When they play good football, audiences will increase and MLS will get earnings from broadcast rights and etc. So the cap is silly and it MUST go. I would like to see Beckham invest heavily and wisely to form a good MLS club.   www.espnfc.com/major-league-soccer/story/1770788/david-beckham-says-mls-salary-cap-needs-to-goreport"
tfc,2ipwzp,Mercento,5,Thu Oct 9 05:46:37 2014 UTC,I'd love for the cap to be eliminated but it's not going anywhere. It's a feature of NA sports. Best we can hope for is for it to be increased substantially. The problem is it's not happening fast enough. There's also this notion of parity that's really holding back the league imo. There will never be good TV ratings until superteams are allowed to be created.
tfc,2ipwzp,danoo,4,Thu Oct 9 06:08:50 2014 UTC,"what MLS wants to avoid at any cost is the fate of the original NASL, which was a number of clubs going bankrupt and the league dissolving. Slow and steady growth is the way forward.  Also the North American market has no real tolerance for superclubs and nobody for those clubs to compete against anyway, so those types of goals and ambitions are pointless."
tfc,2ipwzp,Coramoor_,0,Thu Oct 9 06:14:03 2014 UTC,"USA>England in worldcup  most of USA made up of mls, while england is made up of epl   U mad?"
tfc,2ipwzp,supportingTFC,4,Thu Oct 9 02:53:17 2014 UTC,"In response to your argument that since USA>England and given that USA is made up of MLS and England is made up of EPL, hence MLS>EPL:    EPL is not made up of all English players. There are many talents from all over the world and many players from US team is in EPL for instance, dear old Timmy Howard. Top teams like Arsenal and Chelsea are full of non-english players. So EPL being a highly competively league between skilful teams does not mean that the England Team is just as highly skilful and England Team being such a flop does not mean that EPL teams are horrid.  Coaches. MLS's coaching staff are not up to standard. I dare say the only worldclass coach in the ocuntry right now is Klinsmann. BTW, Moyes is free right now, if any MLS team directors has any sense at all, grab him for despite not being able to effectively manage ManU which is star-studded, he could do one hell of job creating a solid team out of above average players (Everton for instance)."
tfc,2ipwzp,Mercento,-7,Thu Oct 9 03:23:54 2014 UTC,How does it feel that it will be your teams 8th season without making it to the playoffs?   I wonder how you guys can put it up with this sports team?

tfc,2ip3dg,denMAR,7,Wed Oct 8 20:53:36 2014 UTC,no one in the right mind would schedule TFC's home game on the same time as Leafs' season home game opener.
tfc,2ip3dg,feb914,3,Wed Oct 8 21:01:24 2014 UTC,Difference is the MLS schedule was already set way before the new hockey season. You'd have to put blame on the NHL for that issue.
tfc,2ip3dg,RealKidA,3,Wed Oct 8 21:20:26 2014 UTC,NHL doesn't give a fuck. This is a hockey city first and foremost.

tfc,2inlij,TorontoFC15,4,Wed Oct 8 15:39:43 2014 UTC,David Edgar as a DP? That can't be serious.
tfc,2inlij,TorontoFC15,2,Wed Oct 8 15:51:13 2014 UTC,"Well why not? Defender we need, Canadian, nice to return home."
tfc,2inlij,TorontoFC15,3,Wed Oct 8 16:54:15 2014 UTC,But not as a DP. I wouldn't pay that kind of money for any defender more so him.

tfc,2inlij,Soldado4lyf,1 point,Mon Oct 20 23:20:12 2014 UTC,In my view CBs are undervalued in this league. Look at how many goals are scored on set pieces. A player who can defend them at one end and be a threat at the other is hugely valuable. A player who can command an offence is hugely valuable.
tfc,2inlij,TorontoFC15,1 point,Tue Oct 21 00:49:27 2014 UTC,"I agree, I just think you can get valuable CB's without having to spend DP money."

tfc,2inlij,now_we_here,1 point,Wed Oct 8 16:41:17 2014 UTC,"I see that arguement, but it would be ideal to get someone like him. Anyhow, we seriously need a DP defender. Caldwell won't be able to do it by himself."

tfc,2inlij,Swervitu,1 point,Wed Oct 8 16:40:14 2014 UTC,The reason he might leave NY is that he is being played out of position in the mid field and not played as a striker.

tfc,2imv2h,mookeddit,2,Wed Oct 8 05:20:45 2014 UTC,These are nice. The banner usually gets replaced every week or so with a recent photo. Keeps it fresh and also not tied to one constant design. What looks wrong with that? This one's just been up since Portland.
tfc,2imv2h,denMAR,4,Wed Oct 8 16:51:03 2014 UTC,I have no problem with the photo that gets replaced. I think it could be placed in a better location. Take a look at these reddit sites:   Liverpool West Ham NYRB RSL   My thought is to keep the photo just rearrange the site to make it more eye catching.
tfc,2imv2h,quelar,2,Wed Oct 8 17:12:26 2014 UTC,I've always liked where the photo is now. It's very eye catching when it changes.

Sometimes they're one of the best in the MLS sometimes they're worse than LA2. Montreal, God damn we better win this game. Our hated rivals, tabernacs, one of the worst atm, cards will be dealt in our hand but Montreal will try and play spoiler. They'll try and take a lead, hell even a draw, and they'll likely park the bus. New England we should be beating, but Jones is a rock. With a healthy lineup, we should win.

They seemed to play with cohesion and thats something that didn't come often. I think you have to put Defoe out there if he's healthy just to finish chances. I still like the idea of Defoe and Gilberto together, the small, quick get behind the line defender who can capitalize on balls from Bradley and Osorio and then the big target man. It's going to be a tough game, playing at 10:30 eastern time is a minus for us and I don't buy too much into recent form for either team but LA has clinched a playoff spot and we are looking to try and secure one. I think the game means more to us and we could see some fireworks."
tfc,2i4rv7,RaptorFanDanny,3,Thu Oct 2 22:28:55 2014 UTC,Jackson is still suspended so chances are Lovitz will start again. Also not sure about Defoe starting or just coming in later in the game. Either way he won't be playing the full 90 is my guess.   Edit: Gilberto out for this game. Defoe to start with Moore.

It does make sense in a way, I prefer Osorio over Lovitz, and we're up against an offensive team..  but... ..  in the end we'll probably see Warner on the bench, for the reasons you give.  If Defoe really starts beside Gilberto, I wonder what sort of chemistry they'll have.  Gilberto seems like a changed man since the last time they played together, from what I remember anyway.  Should be a good game, it'd be amazing if we could get all 3 points.  I think we can, it just won't be easy.  I'd be happy with a point, really, and a loss won't be a catastrophe, but our guys are pumped up, so I think anything can happen."

Ideally we need a fullback and a winger.  Our backup RB at this point is either Creavalle or one of Henry and Hagglund. Our backup LB is Morgan but I'd like to see him traded for a fresh start because it seems unlikely he's going to get the chance to grow anymore in Toronto.  I wish we hadn't traded Issey because we lack depth on the wings. As far as wingers/outside midfields go. We have Oduro, Jackson and Lovitz with DeRo also able to play in that position as a super sub. 3 players to fill 2 positions is simply not good enough. Sure we've used Osorio and others there but that isn't their main position.  Bringing in a DP fullback and looking for upgrades below that threshold on the wings is probably the better option of the two if we only have 1 spot.  As to who would be available to meet those needs, I really don't know but that's the direction I would like to see the team go."

tfc,2htfro,xthearcher,0,Tue Sep 30 12:35:55 2014 UTC,For some reason I thought we would have to renew our seasons before we get access to the playoff tickets--then we have first dibs on our seats. Anyone else think it works that way? Or am I making this up?
tfc,2ho9jy,MasochisticLeafsFan,7,Sun Sep 28 04:27:27 2014 UTC,This is one of my favorite things about MLS.  It seems like it's like this every year.
tfc,2ho9jy,PM_ME_UR_STREAMS,5,Sun Sep 28 20:10:58 2014 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. I sell that fact to my friends all the time. The league is very, very competitive. Nothing is really set in stone until the final weeks of the season."
tfc,2ho9jy,StJohnsFog,5,Sun Sep 28 20:51:42 2014 UTC,Except the challenge is...it's LA. If we can scrap a tie I'll be happy.
tfc,2ho9jy,TorontoFC15,7,Mon Sep 29 01:03:30 2014 UTC,"After all the crap that's gone down this year (and especially the last couple of months), to be in the mix at all in the home stretch is kind of great.  Step up, boys!"
tfc,2ho9jy,thetonyhightower,4,Sun Sep 28 20:10:49 2014 UTC,"I'm trying to avoid the ""if"" attitude. I remember thinking earlier this season ""if we win these games we have in hand..."""
tfc,2ho9jy,CrashingForeignCars,3,Mon Sep 29 03:23:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I just noticed that. If we win, New England, Kansas City, Columbus and Toronto are all within 2 points of each other (spots 2-5 in the Conference) with 30 games played.  We could also really use the help of L.A. beating New York tonight. Playoff race! This feels nice."
tfc,2ho9jy,moresound17,5,Sun Sep 28 19:09:27 2014 UTC,4-0!!! Oh wait...we play LA next...
tfc,2ho9jy,TorontoFC15,3,Mon Sep 29 15:32:14 2014 UTC,At least we'll have Defoe back from injury!
tfc,2ho9jy,DragonicKhaos,3,Mon Sep 29 21:24:57 2014 UTC,"Two easy home games and potentially being able to take points from NY and NE, it's looking good if TFC has a strong end to the season."
tfc,2ho9jy,Bdog5,3,Sun Sep 28 21:57:04 2014 UTC,The good news is LA beat New York 4-0. The bad news is we play LA next week...
tfc,2ho9jy,currystain37,3,Mon Sep 29 02:40:59 2014 UTC,I think it's optimistic to think we're going to take any points from LA in LA. Even a draw would require a Herculean effort given LA's form right now.
tfc,2ho9jy,errboi,2,Mon Sep 29 17:46:31 2014 UTC,"Also, if we lose our next game and Houston wins 8th place is within one point of us.  Let's not get too carried away now"
tfc,2hmxx1,DragonicKhaos,5,Sat Sep 27 19:10:07 2014 UTC,I was at the game and BMO went crazy when he scored. Loved it!
tfc,2hmxx1,Banach-Tarski,7,Sat Sep 27 23:56:38 2014 UTC,"HOLY SHIT, WE PLAYED TERRIBLE THE 1ST HALF BUT STILL PULLED A WIN!!!!"
tfc,2hmxx1,hot4hotz,5,Sat Sep 27 21:41:17 2014 UTC,aaaaaand now we're back out of a playoff spot. But we're within 5 points of everyone above us that's not named DC United. So that's pretty solid.
tfc,2hmxx1,errboi,2,Sun Sep 28 01:25:10 2014 UTC,"WOOOOOOOO!  Come on Montreal, take it to the KKKrew tonight!"
tfc,2hmxx1,xthearcher,2,Sat Sep 27 19:14:46 2014 UTC,It's weird watching soccer en francais.
tfc,2hmxr8,MethoxyEthane,12,Sat Sep 27 19:08:30 2014 UTC,Great comeback!  They just need to remember to show up for the first 30minutes next time
tfc,2hmxr8,NEeZ44,7,Sat Sep 27 19:11:22 2014 UTC,It's better than not showing up for the last ten...
tfc,2hmxr8,Matt872000,3,Sat Sep 27 19:16:49 2014 UTC,That's for sure!
tfc,2hmxr8,Richard_Swinger_Esq,4,Sat Sep 27 20:16:43 2014 UTC,Getting Oduro for Rey was an absolute steal looking back on it.  Why would they want to give up Oduro?!
tfc,2hmxr8,LightsCameraRegret,2,Sat Sep 27 22:15:00 2014 UTC,"Oduro has a history of becoming lazy and complacent after getting comfortable at his clubs. He was in that phase when they traded him, now he's back to impressing his new club but if Vanney's not careful we'll see the reason clubs keep trading him soon enough."
tfc,2hmxr8,OtterBurger,1 point,Sun Sep 28 17:50:42 2014 UTC,He was the best player on the field for a lot of the game
tfc,2hmxr8,DontGetTooMad,1 point,Sun Sep 28 02:59:32 2014 UTC,o.O Pretty sure the guy closes his eyes if he gets inside the opponents' 18 yard box. He can be so good right up until that last pass or that finishing touch.
tfc,2hmxr8,errboi,2,Sun Sep 28 14:58:19 2014 UTC,He has his moments
tfc,2hmxr8,DontGetTooMad,3,Sun Sep 28 17:06:11 2014 UTC,Defoe will be back and I think that the next two home games should be easy wins. It's looking good right now.
tfc,2hmxr8,Bdog5,2,Sat Sep 27 21:00:02 2014 UTC,"So sad I missed the game, busy with Spurs game. Great win lads, well deserved!"
tfc,2hmxr8,TorontoFC15,2,Sat Sep 27 20:18:45 2014 UTC,"We're like the undead... not too long ago left at the side of the road, down 2 at the half, but still trundling on and getting some every time we smell blood. It's ugly, but it works.   And Hagglund woke up for the second half after a dreadful first... Can't help but feel happy for the guy. If Montreal can do us a favour, we might be in with a shot!"
tfc,2hmxr8,mongo5mash,1 point,Sat Sep 27 22:01:45 2014 UTC,Shocking! What a surprising game :)
tfc,2hmxr8,fuzz_boy,1 point,Sat Sep 27 19:54:51 2014 UTC,so sick

tfc,2hn44k,rsoccer,3,Sat Sep 27 20:15:18 2014 UTC,Look at Gilberto's tiny assist on Hagglund's second goal.  The man is amazing.
