Anarchism,3e3xsi,satanic_satanist,2,Tue Jul 21 19:40:48 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, the broad differences probably come down to different theories about the mechanism of exploitation. Those who get their theory from Proudhon or similar sources are likely to see exploitation as the result of governmental structures operating within the economy, while those who get their theory from Marxist sources are likely to see particular practices (employment, exchange, etc.) as more necessarily exploitative. There's lot of room for nuance in all the specific tendencies, but when it is a question of abolishing money, it probably does come down to whether or not your think a circulating medium of exchange, whatever its specific form, is itself linked to the mechanism of capitalist exploitation."

Despite how much love the PKK gets around here you have to remember that 40,000 people died in the last war. Most of them civilians.   However, Erdogan dug his own grave. This past year he seemed almost hellbent on derailing any chance at peace. And he got what he asked for. If the PKK were beginning to turn away from terrorism/guerrilla warfare with the Turkish state this time last year, they sure as fuck aren't now."

Anarchism,3e19qy,spartan2600,3,Tue Jul 21 04:37:03 2015 UTC,"This is a poor response to Mason's article, regardless of the accuracy of Mason's claims.   I can’t make sense of the “currently stalled because our social infrastructure cannot bear the consequences” — has capitalism ever skipped an innovation because of its social consequences? — but there’s no evidence that info tech is “hugely diminish[ing] the amount of work needed.”   Expressing this argument in some economically quantifiable way probably means something like “the relation between GDP growth and employment growth has broken down.”   Henwood then presents graphs of this data to support his claim. Note that the trend in employment growth since 1980 has increasingly been weaker than expected. Furthermore, this data tells us nothing about the overall percentage of the working age population performing labour: It is possible for employment to grow and their still be an increasing group of people falling into the category ""economically inactive"".    Put another way, were IT really making workers less necessary, we should be seeing more productivity growth, and not less.    Mason has preempted this argument by pointing to the proliferation of coffee shops and whatnot."
Anarchism,3e19qy,enucleated,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:05 2015 UTC,"Mason has preempted this argument by pointing to the proliferation of coffee shops and whatnot.   This doesn't make any sense to me, perhaps because I haven't read the original argument. Productivity growth has slowed, unequivocally, and this coincided with the ""IT"" revolution, so it seems impossible to argue that IT (or some other form of mechanization) is somehow replacing workers because of its accelerating effects on productivity. Robots have NOT taken our jobs, poorer people in other countries have."
Anarchism,3e19qy,redzenfan,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:09 2015 UTC,"Here is Mason's original text.. Note:   As a result, large parts of the business class have become neo-luddites. Faced with the possibility of creating gene-sequencing labs, they instead start coffee shops, nail bars and contract cleaning firms: the banking system, the planning system and late neoliberal culture reward above all the creator of low-value, long-hours jobs.   Ergo we have an answer as to why we're seeing reductions in productivity (I assume the measure you're using is GDP/Hours Labour, if not let me know) alongside increasing automation. You're also seem to be falling into the trap of assuming that export of labour from the western economies is dichotomous with the effects increasing automation. Why couldn't both effects exist simultaneously?"
Anarchism,3e19qy,enucleated,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"Where is the argument about technology in there? He says this:   Today there is no pressure from the workforce, and the technology at the centre of this innovation wave does not demand the creation of higher-consumer spending, or the re‑employment of the old workforce in new jobs.   I.e., labor lacks power against capital, so all this shit happens. It has nothing to do with the changing technological base, or an accelerating rate of productivity. This is all about worker power waning relative to capitalists."
