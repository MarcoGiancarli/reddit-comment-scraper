If you're asking why it doesn't have a set release day like western shows is from what i understand is because animes are made by studios. These studios may have different animes in the works and may cause delays. Another reason might be because since the anime is made to 'promote' the Light Novels, It might not be popular enough to create another series.  In Short: Anime releases are determined by many factors, the main ones are Popularity/Success (dvd sales), Funding (Ties into success of the anime), and if there is enough material to make a new season (In this case there is alot of volumes still)  EDIT: Also the VA (voice actors) also have different projects going on, animes take alot of time you know not just point, shoot, and edit"

HighschoolDxD,3e3x8y,Muhei,6,Tue Jul 21 19:51:46 2015 UTC,"It's only sad, because Rias is the most shalllow of the main characters alongside Gasper in my opinion. She is popular because she is the main girl, and looks good, i can't argue with that. She is probably the most selfish of them all, we can clearly see that in volume 10. In the anime none of the girls are explained like in the LNs, so an average anime watcher doesn't know them that well. And there's nothing wrong with that, we can't demand everyone to read the source material of any anime they watch. And probably that's the reason why the girls of DxD weren't so successful in the brackets. People had to judge them from a few episodes of the anime, where they couldn't get to know them that well.    (My god I will get so much hate, I can foresee that.)"

HighschoolDxD,3e3x8y,NilCealum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:09:51 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it, I WOULD pick Holo. But there are several things going against her as well:   For a centuries-old deity, she is remarkably immature. Her maturity only shows up when she's either on her guard or when stuck in a serious situation. And no, I'm not talking about when she's with Lawrence alone. It's the same thing as Akeno, except that it's more acceptable for her since she's just 18. I actually think another deity similar to her is more mature and she's lived only 9 centuries (Rory Mercury, GATE). She hasn't mastered her powers nor has she accepted them. Because of that, it's Lawrence who tries to bridge the interspecies gap...while Akeno did everything in her power to accept it and master it. In fact, Spice and Wolf doesn't raise that issue again even when they're close enough to. Whoever claims that Holo is more wholesome than Akeno can fuck off. She's just as lewd, the anime and light novel just doesn't show it as explicitly as DxD. The difference being, Lawrence is a total furry and Issei only has eyes on Rias (for now).   Besides that, she has more extensive vocabulary and is generally more calm in strange situations."

It's purely because not only Spice&Wolf is completed, it's also very different, and Holo is simply amazing both in terms of personality as well as looks..and let's be honest, she is a freakin diety. As for Akeno, she still lacks something for me when she's put against Holo. When HS DxD finishes, I may change my mind, but right now..not so much."

HighschoolDxD,3e2kph,dahaxguy,2,Tue Jul 21 14:03:59 2015 UTC,The thing that really sold me back when I watched DxD for the first time was the relationship between Rias and Issei. S2E10 is my favorite.  So keeping in mind what Issei thinks of himself (especially after Yuuma/Raynare) and thinks of Rias should do no harm.  Other than that just have fun (not that that would be hard in any way - if you can enjoy its themes DxD is super fun.)

HighschoolDxD,3e13t9,mpz28,2,Tue Jul 21 04:59:50 2015 UTC,"There's about 6-7 illustrations per volume of the LN. But for the most part, it's just text, Definitely worth it though. I suggest starting with Vol 5, as BorN changed a lot of Vol 5-7.  Or you can start back at Vol 1, because apparently theres more information. I've never read Vol 1-4, and just picked up with 5 after season 2 ended, but it's worth it either way imho."
HighschoolDxD,3e13t9,thejman6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"yeah, i'm in a similar situation. I'm a heavy reader of normal English novels, but the light novel seems so hard to read (the translated one on baka tsuki). just doesn't feel like im reading books as much as reading a summary/script"
HighschoolDxD,3e13t9,rj6553,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:39:40 2015 UTC,"I was in much the same boat as you. In fact, this is the first LN I have ever read. It seems that most people recommend starting with volume 5 as the anime changed quite a bit in season 3 (though I have heard there is talk that they plan to be more faithful going forward if/when they get the green light for another season. I think OVA 4 is supposed to be out in December). For me, it was a great starting point as I got to see how season 3 ""should"" have progressed and yet I was quickly able to get into the new material. Baka-tsuki has been great for me. It reads a little weird for my taste but the story really makes the effort worth it."

Reading it is like reading the anime, the dialogue and style is really similar to the show.  Yes, if you have any interest in DxD you should definitely read them, because they're great. Even though you finished BorN, I advise you start on those novels (Volume 5-7) because they changed and cut a LOT. Skipping Volumes 1-4 is ok because the anime adapts them pretty well, but BorN is not the same."

HighschoolDxD,3dzilk,jax05,3,Mon Jul 20 21:23:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, it captivated me as much and more than the anime.  There are some illustrations, but not a ton.  Just give volume 5 a read and if you really don't like it, give it up."

HighschoolDxD,3dzilk,jax05,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:49 2015 UTC,"Anime is generally used to advertise the cheaper-to-produce source material. In this case, the Light Novels. BorN just aired, leading to a spike in light novel sales which is the goal.  The creators have to decide whether or not a season 4 will give them the return on investment they're hoping for. In many cases the later in a series it gets, the less efficient those seasons are at advertising the source material.  IF, and that's a big IF, DxD gets a season 4, it'll be announced after sales of the source material have stabilized."

HighschoolDxD,3dzgw6,prxmix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:25 2015 UTC,"The muted scenes are done in a lot of anime by the Japanese culture and the English dub tends to ruin them. I remember one time when that happened in Naruto.  In the Itachi vs Sasuke fight just as Itachi is about to die before he places his fingers on Sasukes forehead he says something, but no words come out. As the scene was remade into the Naruto Generations game it now has dialogue saying ""Sasuke sorry this is it"", it's in there English and Japanese though. So it's not directly insulting English Dub but it's annoying that they took that mystery away of Itachi possibly telling him he loved him. But yet it does potential spoil Itachis secret."

HighschoolDxD,3dzoq1,DragonDxD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"Erm if I understand correctly, you want an app to watch the episodes on. The one i'm currently using is called Animania. You have to download it via your browser, as it can't be found in the appstore. I hope I answered your question"

HighschoolDxD,3dzoq1,Melonslicer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:33:02 2015 UTC,"Use /u/Chillora's option if you're on Android. If you're on an iPhone, either import this folder to your Google Drive and read them from the Google Drive app or download them from the same link and use a PDF viewer to read them.  I myself am using iFile as my file manager on iOS and it has a built-in PDF viewer. That's the best option if you ask me, but jailbreak is required."

HighschoolDxD,3dzoq1,calleha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:58:31 2015 UTC,I have a jailbreak and I'm absolutely in love 3x3 icons with a naruto font (thx btw)
HighschoolDxD,3dzoq1,DragonDxD,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:31 2015 UTC,"I used to have 4x3 icons and 5 icons in the dock, all icons being square shaped with no shadow. It looked really nice, but I haven't jailbroken my new phone yet because evasi0n doesn't seem to work properly on OSX. My iPad is still jailbroken though, I read the LNs on there.  So since you have a jailbreak, just install iFile from Cydia (if you don't already have it) and download the LNs using Safari. When it asks what app it should use to open the files, choose iFile. In iFile, save them to Documents and open them using PDF Viewer."

HighschoolDxD,3dy5zn,Niiiz,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:07 2015 UTC,It seems too fake to me. A lot of spelling and grammar mistakes. And the fact that this blog or web got the scoop before all the other major anime sites is suspicious.
HighschoolDxD,3dy5zn,Lord_of_Bored212,0,Mon Jul 20 14:48:35 2015 UTC,Yeah a site with this many grammatical issues in the article and the fact that they feature image is from New instead of BorN leaves me doubting that they'd have the info before other sites
HighschoolDxD,3dy5zn,Browseitall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:57:47 2015 UTC,"Two season a year is dmn bad marketing. As much as i would like to see it soon, it wont happen that soon. But i also got some trouble claiming that its all out troll/fake. Guess the author interpreted something wrong or so. The most we can expect until December this year would be an OVA."
HighschoolDxD,3dy5zn,Meatfeast85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:52:46 2015 UTC,Probably fake. The studio is probably working on the OVA that will be released at the end of the year. Plus they will be waiting to see how good BorNs sales are before making a decision on season 4.

HighschoolDxD,3dvrqc,WorstPCplayerEver,2,Mon Jul 20 20:18:18 2015 UTC,It's not even bad. I'm an LN reader and sure it strayed. But many more shows have fucked up wayy worst.

HighschoolDxD,3dvrqc,dahaxguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:19 2015 UTC,I think Grabbin' Dragon was used for tongue-rolling convenience. The nursery-like rhyme adheres well to the the pseudo-childish perversion of the song imo

HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,kentonbomb84,8,Sun Jul 19 08:18:49 2015 UTC,That's probably the one thing the dub managed to do right.  They prevented themselves from butchering it.
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,Bargoob,2,Sun Jul 19 08:29:06 2015 UTC,I doubt they would've have butchered it. Different sure but it would've came out fine. Leaving it in Japanese without any subs is just a slap to the face. Literally no point since dub only watchers will have 0 idea what the hell he's saying

HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,Bargoob,2,Sun Jul 19 11:11:57 2015 UTC,"i would say ""Subs are infinitely better"" anime fans are probably the ones who think that. but the subs aren't correctly translated either."
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,captaincrunchie,0,Tue Jul 21 09:17:12 2015 UTC,"I've watched the sub and dub versions for all 3 seasons and the sub voice actors are better than the dub voice actors at showing their emotions in their voices. If you need a good example watch season 1 episode 5 with Asia dying/Issei snapping and fighting Raynare. That's not to say the dub voices are bad, they just aren't as much emotionally invested as the Japanese cast."
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,AkenoBestGirl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"I don't agree.  I think the dub really captures the situation.  Besides, the Japanese are known for over exaggerating their speech patterns in anime.  not only that, but Issei is also filled with sadness, then it turns into anger, and a sense of purpose. i feel that the dub definitely captured that feeling."
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,RedditDrummar,-3,Tue Jul 21 09:15:06 2015 UTC,"I could go on about all the reasons why DxD's dub is bad, but I'll spare everyone that.  I will say that the atmosphere of the show is completely different between the two and I feel the dub is the inferior way to enjoy the story.  I can only picture Ishibumi shaking his head while reading the dub's script.  This is coming from someone that had watched the 1st season of DxD dubbed before watching the subbed (Back when I only wanted to watch dubbed anime).  I hope what I said above doesn't come across as a personal insult or anything though, as that was not the intention.  The dub kind of seems like a professionally made fandub with the amount of ridiculous sex jokes made in every conversation."
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,AkenoBestGirl,3,Sun Jul 19 09:40:01 2015 UTC,"I noticed that, the sub version seemed more.. deeper in a way? Like more emotionally charged. I do like the voices of the dub version more though."
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,calleha,4,Sun Jul 19 13:06:00 2015 UTC,"Akenos dubbed voice in season 1&2 is amazing so sad they changed her, still can't replace Ara-ara though, also I think Terry Rogers did a really poor Issei. That being said there's still no reason to look down on people's preference, everyone should be able to watch what they want without people constantly stating how wrong you are."
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,RedditDrummar,2,Sun Jul 19 10:37:34 2015 UTC,"Wasnt it josh grelle who replaced Scott.  Though your completely right about akeno.  Though the point was how everyone was expecting a dub version of the song and we didn't get it. It be like if they did the JD in japanese, just so out of place. Yet it turned into a dub/sub arguement, just like every post about anime that has a dub."
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,calleha,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:49:46 2015 UTC,"You know what fucks me off? So many people slanted Akeno's dubbed voice in season 1 and 2 BEFORE she was removed.  Now everything thinks it was so good.  I don't know if you were one of those people, probably not, but it's so dumb that since she got replaced everyone who hated her suddenly loves her"
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,RedditDrummar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:48:47 2015 UTC,"Actually I started watching kinda late, just after BorN came out. I didn't know about the voice change until after I caught up as I didn't pay any attention to anything other than watching the anime, needless to say I was extremely sad as it was definitely my favorite voice of them all right from the start :("
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,calleha,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:17:06 2015 UTC,It annoys me too. I am one of the people who hated Akeno's dubbed voice in S1 and S2 and I was surprised when people started disliking the new voice and suddenly liking the old one. The new voice is much better if you ask me.
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,yay4hippies,2,Sun Jul 19 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"It's just another reason for people to jump onto the ""DUBBED ANIME SUCKS"" train.  I enjoy both Dubbed and Subbed. I've seen DxD in both versions and I'm soon to watch the rest of S3 Dubbed.  Personally I'm easy to please and pretty lenient when it comes to anime and voices. I watched the dubbed originally too, so on my first impression I didn't think Akeno's voice was bad in S1 and S2. I did notice there were parts that definitely felt off but overall I didn't think it was bad. I do admit I really like her new VA though, more than the previous. People just see it as more stuff to bitch about to make the dub seem worse than it is because people are too elitist."
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,drunkn_master,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:06:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I watched the dub the first time too. I didn't have any problem with Akeno's voice either until I rewatched after I had watched the sub.  The dub isn't bad at all but you can sometimes clearly notice that they were just trying to lipsync. I really like Koneko's voice in the dub and of course, Issei's voice before S3. Issei's new voice isn't terrible, but doesn't quite fit. It's hard to compete with Issei's voice in the japanese version."

HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,calleha,3,Mon Jul 20 17:47:44 2015 UTC,"Omfg, could we just fucking stop overreacting about every little crap in the dubbed version?  I don't get that ""my sub is more fucking awesome than the dub"" bullshit. The dub is for people wo do not want to read the shit out of a series. Even of there are differences people don't care, lean back and enjoy the stuff. Yeah the oppai song is the original. Fine! What is so fucking hilarious about it?"
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,CaptainnStorm,2,Mon Jul 20 05:27:38 2015 UTC,"They can't win, before this people complained they would absolutely wreck it and they were doomed. They leave it the same to make these people happy, and more people bitch. They would have to change almost everything about it get it to work correctly. And fans would castrate it if there was even the slight tempo change from the original. Change the lyrics to get it to work with the beat, and people would ostracize it.  Translating a song like that would be an absolute nightmare. They did the right thing."
HighschoolDxD,3dthkn,White_Mocha,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:32:44 2015 UTC,"You have to remember this is only the early version of the dub, by the time they get around to releasing it on BD they should've fixed up any little issues by then & do the extra things that normally gets done when they have more time to do so, also if you remember about ""NEW"" it was over a year after when it first released before they released the dub version, i'm just happy they done it this quick at all ;)"

HighschoolDxD,3dovdt,ObeyPyro,7,Mon Jul 20 20:53:47 2015 UTC,That's amazing. She's actually IMO one of the best voice actresses in the dub too.
HighschoolDxD,3dovdt,dahaxguy,3,Sat Jul 18 02:37:07 2015 UTC,"Yes she is. Out of the four voice actors that I met and get to meet again, she's my favorite (that includes Monica Rial).  I still wish to meet Jamie Marchi (voice of Rias). :("
HighschoolDxD,3dovdt,dahaxguy,2,Sat Jul 18 02:41:56 2015 UTC,"From personal experience, Jamie's a cool cat and all, but she's nowhere near as charismatic and outgoing as Monica, coming off quite cold in comparison. I have a Panty and Stocking poster signed by them, and a picture of them with it (that I have since lost, unfortunately), and Monica definitely stole the show at that signing.  But I've met several actors and actresses over the last three years, and all of them are extremely wonderful people. My personal favorites were Steve Blum (of Cowboy Bebop fame) and Scott Freeman (the first voice of Issei), since they were heavily invested and involved with their roles."
HighschoolDxD,3dovdt,RiasIsMyWaifu,2,Sat Jul 18 02:55:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. Monica definitely stole the show. She had the most experience, most stories, iconic voice. And by her talking, I can tell she was a very laid back person. Jamie sounds a lot more professional."
HighschoolDxD,3dovdt,warincon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:25 2015 UTC,"Not so much more professional; she seemed to be more like Johnny Yong Bosch, just socially awkward.

But with what I'm expecting of Volume 20 from what I read before it released. This kind of humor is going to be needed. I'm expecting my heart to be broken and have a pit in my stomach when I think of Volume 20. In a very good way though, I'm figuratively on the edge of my seat. I haven't been this excited for a volume maybe ever.  DxD has always had this kind of humor. So I'm happy to hear about it. This story arc has been a bit more serious than others. With that though they've still had comedy like you said with Fafnir and even Vali. Personally I think it's at a perfect balance now. We need those light hearted moments so when serious stuff happens it's not a non stop exhausting experience if that makes sense."

HighschoolDxD,3dplme,Meatfeast85,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:54:03 2015 UTC,Actually the end of episode 12 is the end of volume 6 with the 3 legged race. Volume 7 more or less finished after Akeno 'reconciled' with her father in episode 5. Everything after episode 5 is volume 6 and anime original content.

HighschoolDxD,3dcuf0,ximca,3,Wed Jul 15 07:18:12 2015 UTC,"Okay you angry devils, time to give you my reasons as to why I said ""American"" dub and not ""English"" dub of DxD, since it's ridiculous that some people are somehow triggered by it.   I said American because it's the place it's made on, the place where most of its targeted audience lives, and how the English in that particular dub is spoken. I never said anything about the swearing defining its being American, or that the location where it's made is purely my basis for labeling it the American dub.  This labeling goes back to Dragon Ball/Z, where there are two American dubs at present. One is called Faulconer, and the other one is Funimation. Note that both of them are Funimation, one is just distinguished from its sound director. In the past it was referred to as the American dub, because it wouldn't make sense if it was called the ""English"" dub. Which dub would you be referring to then if you said English? Singaporean? British? Malaysian? Filipino?  So you can boost all those worries away about me being unintentionally ignorant or racist or what have you. This is just a list of anime with American cultural elements playing a big part in its series in celebration of the DxD dub made in good old Texas. Yeah I know there's only one dub of it right now that's in English, but I'm from the generation where I label dubs according to where its made, how the English is spoken, and to which country it's mainly targeted at.  Once again, I'm sorry for offending your sensibilities.  And I'm also a little bit mad, since this is exactly what I escaped /r/anime for. I couldn't say a thing there that wasn't offending someone else, even if I wasn't being explicitly offensive. People should learn to rein in their sensibilities on the internet, or else I'd have been launching a crusade against this subreddit since I'm a devout Catholic and devils offend me."

HighschoolDxD,3dcuf0,6l4c13m,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:11:49 2015 UTC,"Here's where you're wrong.  ""American"" is not a language.  The location that the dub was produced in should have nothing to do with what the dub is called.  Going by your logic, an anime with a Spanish dub produced in America would also be an ""American"" dub.  Wouldn't it be confusing if countries with multiple national languages refer to their dubs by the country's name?  Or what if a country uses another countries language as their primary language? How would people know what language the dub is? Dubs are named by the language used, not the location of production.  If you had referred to the anime listed as English dubs that adapt the source material to better suit American culture then you would be fine.  Alternatively, dubbed in America could also work.  Also, nobody is mad or upset by the way.  People just prefer not to live in a world where ignorance is left uncorrected."

HighschoolDxD,3dc6uk,lt13jimmy,12,Wed Jul 15 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's not just Asia who is cockblocking. Other girls do it as well, it's just that her cockblocking started very early, basically right after she was introduced (the little sister jealous type). Later on into the story each girl cockblocks, even Rias, and possibly she does it the most. Why does no one hate on her for that reason? Because she is the one Ise fell for? Is that an excuse? Meh, I hate Asia haters if their only reasoning is because of cockblock. :/"
HighschoolDxD,3dc6uk,Skydanzer,3,Wed Jul 15 03:31:49 2015 UTC,"I never considered that as a reason to hate her tbh. Because its comic relief so i never thought of it.

HighschoolDxD,3dc6uk,mpz28,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:41:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the relationship dynamic in the show makes it worth watching. I really enjoy the bits where they're outside of battle and are just being kinda normal."

HighschoolDxD,3d7gxd,wingblade95,6,Tue Jul 14 02:53:49 2015 UTC,Ise/Asia/Xenovia/Irina: 17  Akeno/Rias: 18  Rossweisse: 18-20  Koneko/Gasper: 15/16  Kuroka: Early-mid 20s  The only thing we know about Sirzechs's age is that he's over 200 years old. I doubt he's close to 2000 though.
HighschoolDxD,3d7gxd,Chichiryuushintei,2,Tue Jul 14 04:48:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, that's sounds about right. The only one I'm unsure with is Rossweisse. Wasn't there some quote from Isse where he said you'd expect her to be a bit older than him but they're around the same age? I took that as her being around 18. Though I'm sure some super fans of Rose are better equipped to know this.  I always guessed Kuroka's age to be around 19-20. And the reason I said that is the age gap between Koneko and her being more than that (potentially up to a decade apart) just feels a bit off. Koneko has a wicked memory of her sister if they're that far apart. Vali's younger than Ise, so I also find it entertaining if she is in her mid 20's getting ordered around by a 16 year old.  All that I can find about Azazel is he's many millennia old. Which makes sense, he predates the war between the three factions and even the Fallen Angels/Grigori  themselves."
HighschoolDxD,3d7gxd,Dark_Knight_Reddits,2,Tue Jul 14 07:05:40 2015 UTC,"I think it was stated Ross's one or two years older than the Grmeory group somewhere. Don't remember where though. And if she's old enough to drink, she's at least 20, since that's the legal age for consuming alcohol in Japan.  I say that about Kuroka because apparently she had a developed body when she killed her master, so at least was in her mid-late teens at the time.  I don't think Azazel is many millennia old because Odin keeps calling him brat. So he may be like, 3000 years old, but not much more than that."
HighschoolDxD,3d7gxd,Chichiryuushintei,2,Tue Jul 14 07:58:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I absolutely now agree for Rose. I think you're definitely correct there with the drinking stuff. Drinking age where I live is 18, so that probably confused me a bit.  For Azazel, there was a quote where he said ""the reason I became a Fallen Angel all those millennia ago was lust."" Odin comes from a mythology much older than Christianity, so I think that's why Odin calls him a brat. Odin is always called the geezer, makes sense to call someone younger than him a brat. Even if that person is thousands of years old. Azazel has called Sirzechs much younger than him.  Edit: I should mention I don't think Azazel's like 10,000+ years old. I actually agree he's somewhere around 3000-4000 years old. I'd guess Michael is around the same age due to their history."
HighschoolDxD,3d7gxd,Dark_Knight_Reddits,3,Tue Jul 14 08:41:23 2015 UTC,"Well we do know that Asia, Issei, Xenovia, Kiba and Irina are 16-17, Akeno is 17-18, Koneko and Gasper (?) are 15-16. I don't know about the others though. And I'm not totally sure about the listed above, so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong."
HighschoolDxD,3d7gxd,Niiiz,2,Tue Jul 14 03:07:35 2015 UTC,"Rias prob have the same age as akeno since she still can't participate in official battle ratings, and if im not mistaken age was one of the prerequirements for it"
