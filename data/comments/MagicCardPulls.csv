MagicCardPulls,3e36v9,Neighbour-Totoro,2,Tue Jul 21 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly - If you don't plan on using them in a deck, see about trading them off for full value  for more useful cards with another player, or trade in for credit/cash at your LGS Ideally (for me)- Help people who need them get them :)"

Years ago, I was in a retro draft, with packs from Arabian Nights up to what was then present. The old packs were in brown envelopes, and handed out randomly.

Not to mention I was lucky enough not to get paired down.
MagicCardPulls,3cxzjv,dredriksalkon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:54:35 2015 UTC,Yeah unfortunately Piledriver is pretty weak in sealed due to the lack of other goblins unless you are against a blue deck.
MagicCardPulls,3cy097,Magnivore703,2,Sat Jul 11 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"It will be worth a decent amount just because it is a mythic, those tend to hold their value.  But I think Chandra and Jace are the least likely to see constructed play, meaning it won't be a huge amount of money."

MagicCardPulls,3cy097,w00tthehuk,2,Sun Jul 12 01:05:33 2015 UTC,I think the casting cost is low enough that it'll see some play in mono-red. I have 2 pre-prdered for friday pickup and will be trying at FNM.
MagicCardPulls,3cy097,evildave_666,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:38:12 2015 UTC,"According to SCG, so take or leave the source, right now her estimated value is about $12 for a normal, $40 for a foil, and somewhere in the middle for the promo.  That will change, for better or worse, when origins hits to see if she finds pay anywhere.   If it proceeds as expected, she's likely going to drop to a 5 normal, 10 foil.  If there's a surprise in her addition, then she could spike like any other sleeper card."

MagicCardPulls,3bm2r0,Kidsune,5,Tue Jun 30 11:30:04 2015 UTC,"You see, it's tough, because as a 15 year veteran Pokemon card collector, where even commons range from .10 cents each to .50 cents each, it's hard to see cards be so much less valuable, like, 0.01 cents. Hard to believe. but who knows, maybe the neighborhood kids will like them."
MagicCardPulls,3bm2r0,NecessaryMutilation,3,Tue Jun 30 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"It's because everybody who has gotten packs at all has them.  Online commons are priced anywhere from .01 to .10 or .25 or whatnot.  But why bother, if you have a healthy playgroup you could grab those cards for next to nothing.  Throw a $3-5 rare at your pal and they'll prob let you grab as many commons/uncommons as you want from their bulk.  Or if you're a new player they'll let you have free reign even, by reasonable means at least."
MagicCardPulls,3bm2r0,xdest,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:34:27 2015 UTC,"I've never played before, lol.... not sure if I should start or if these cards are a good way to start... I've been over in Camp Pokemon for the past 15 years hahahahah!"
MagicCardPulls,3bm2r0,jamesbretz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"Wait a moment, I have Pokemon booster displays full of cards from 15 years ago (First Edition and Jungle) in my parents basement. Are you telling me those are worth 10 cents per card?"
MagicCardPulls,3bm2r0,FurDeg,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:13:58 2015 UTC,"erm, yeah maybe, I'd need to see them... some of the commons are. I collect/play that game, not magic :)"
MagicCardPulls,3bm2r0,FurDeg,6,Wed Jul 1 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"FYI - Just because you didn't steal it, doesn't mean it's not stolen property."
MagicCardPulls,3bm2r0,NecessaryMutilation,2,Tue Jun 30 15:07:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you, all of you, for your advice. I won't sell them. I have no proof they were stolen, just that it looks like it, but still, you are right."
MagicCardPulls,3bm2r0,bobartig,2,Tue Jun 30 15:11:12 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible someone just bought a box, went out back to a quiet spot to open them, and abandoned the literally worthless cards and wrappers.  If you're feeling charitable, your Local Game Store will happily take them for free."
MagicCardPulls,3bm2r0,bobartig,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:28:54 2015 UTC,"The thieves took everything worth more than a dollar.  You can sell bulk lots on eBay, but considering 100 cards in mint condition, without any duplicates, goes for less than $1, you'd be hardpressed to make more than $3 out of your lot.  You've only got a small bulk of penny cards, that no one would want, especially in that condition. Many places will only buy bulk lots of cards at $0.01 per card.  eBay examples.  Card Store Locator.  If you tell anyone that you're selling to that the goods were found behind a store, and they were potentially stolen, you'll not get anyone who wants to buy them.  I've seen many stores sell bulk lots of 1,000 cards for $5, just to shift the unwanted junk, like what you've got."
MagicCardPulls,3bgtn6,ExtremePizza,2,Mon Jun 29 02:34:13 2015 UTC,Just when I thought I was out...They pull me back in...
MagicCardPulls,3bgtn6,Reedobandito,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"I'm totally out, though! This is probably the best luck I've had in ~2 years."
MagicCardPulls,3bgtn6,Predawncarpet,2,Mon Jun 29 22:00:14 2015 UTC,I have been trying to get Ugin for a while. He is one elusive bastard. All of my money recently has gone into the search.
MagicCardPulls,3bgtn6,Emorjkid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:34:38 2015 UTC,"I pulled 2 the night of prerelease and 1 the day after and then I decided fate reforged was my comfort zone, well that plus prerelease tasigur, unfortunately I sold all of my ugins because my gf is a tad expensive"
MagicCardPulls,3bgtn6,Predawncarpet,2,Mon Jul 13 01:00:13 2015 UTC,That is incredibly sad! I managed to snag one on ebay for $25! I'd love to get three more for a full play set but I'm not that rich or lucky.
MagicCardPulls,3bgtn6,Emorjkid,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:08:17 2015 UTC,"I wish I kept mine for edh but ehh, if I pull any more I'll sell all after the first, the store I sell to here pays less than half so I'll hit you up if I ever get another few"
MagicCardPulls,3bgtn6,Predawncarpet,2,Mon Jul 13 02:25:52 2015 UTC,I'd absolutley appreciate that! I actually just recently got into Magic a couple months ago. I've been trying to build up a deck to beat my older brother with! He's been playing for a while and has several pretty epic decks lol
MagicCardPulls,3bgtn6,Emorjkid,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:44:26 2015 UTC,"Sweet, I got in just as m15 came along and I loved it, the last time I opened packs was frf prerelease though, minus a few modern masters 15 packs I got as a gift, now I mostly play pauper which I recommend if money's tight, might even make for a fun format for you and your brother to try out, it'll even the playing field as you'll both be starting out fresh and it's cheap to make a deck"
MagicCardPulls,3bgtn6,Predawncarpet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:56:00 2015 UTC,I'll definitely look into that!
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,xdest,9,Sat Jun 27 12:12:48 2015 UTC,"Dammn, is that a Chronicles Blood Moon?  Nice."
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Unholy_Butcherer,6,Sat Jun 27 12:54:31 2015 UTC,"How much do these go for, because i bought a seriously NM one on eBay like 2 months ago before the buyout for $15"
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Blastmaster29,5,Sun Jun 28 02:52:12 2015 UTC,"About $50 now, I think. They've risen a bit."
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Unholy_Butcherer,4,Sun Jun 28 03:00:25 2015 UTC,"I think I see a second Revised Sol Ring. Better start building some more EDH decks, then.  Oh, I mean...  Damn, are those two Revised Sol Rings?  Nice."
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Brawler_1337,3,Sat Jun 27 18:06:38 2015 UTC,First thing I replaced. Who needs those black bordered ones with the computer generated ring on it anyway.
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Brawler_1337,2,Sat Jun 27 18:29:14 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I do not mind the new Sol Ring art. However, the old art is so much more evocative of the card itself. It is clearly a ring of the sun, not just a ring with light coming out of it."
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Matrix115,5,Sat Jun 27 18:37:40 2015 UTC,Damn is that three mana vaults?  Nice.
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Cowcrusader,3,Sat Jun 27 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"Damn, is that a revised Kird Ape?   Nice."
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,tom_rorow,2,Sat Jun 27 17:51:44 2015 UTC,There were 5 in there. Got to build that legacy deck now.
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,canuck268,2,Sat Jun 27 18:25:04 2015 UTC,Damn is that a Sylvan Library?  Nice.
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Saturated_Wombat,2,Sat Jun 27 13:53:09 2015 UTC,thats a fucking great score!
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,SarcoZQ,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man. It can happen to you, too."
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Brawler_1337,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:31:01 2015 UTC,Damn no one saw the maze of ith?
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Brawler_1337,3,Sat Jun 27 15:30:20 2015 UTC,"Or the Pendlehaven, or the full playset of Urza lands. I fear all of my luck has been blown on this buy."
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,Brawler_1337,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:16:38 2015 UTC,Or the Land tax from legends. ;) Nice haul!
MagicCardPulls,3baqrv,7946138520,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:56:08 2015 UTC,Seems like an Italian black border Land Tax to me. Still an awesome find.
MagicCardPulls,3b8f3j,p1i1c1h1u,5,Fri Jun 26 20:23:13 2015 UTC,Great pulls from a free box!
MagicCardPulls,3b8f3j,PhoenixBurning,2,Sat Jun 27 05:07:03 2015 UTC,As well as a bunch of commons to screw around and make decks with!
MagicCardPulls,3b8f3j,Brawler_1337,5,Sat Jun 27 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"Unhinged Forest? Damn, that's lucky. And I'd look to unload those Serum Visions soon. With Scry now evergreen, it's even more likely that we will see a reprint soon. Plus, that gives you $60 for other sweet cards!"
MagicCardPulls,3b8f3j,Brawler_1337,2,Sat Jun 27 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually gave away the box the forest was in. I was lucky enough to spot it before I did though ."
MagicCardPulls,3b5x6k,mixmatch89,2,Fri Jun 26 06:01:02 2015 UTC,:D
MagicCardPulls,3b2uyq,deathapples,3,Thu Jun 25 14:57:56 2015 UTC,That's amazing! But I hate you.
MagicCardPulls,3b2uyq,zomgitsduke,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:18:08 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm a luck sac.
MagicCardPulls,3b2uyq,DaFaqPony,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:23:25 2015 UTC,In one pack?
MagicCardPulls,3b3hav,PeanutCure,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:42:17 2015 UTC,And one of those [[Monastery Mentor]] is foil. Mercy me.
MagicCardPulls,3b3hav,Brawler_1337,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:43:22 2015 UTC,Time to build a Mentor deck?
MagicCardPulls,3b0bhk,p1i1c1h1u,5,Wed Jun 24 23:06:18 2015 UTC,"Plot twist, all lands."
MagicCardPulls,3b0bhk,Admiral_haxbar,7,Wed Jun 24 23:32:34 2015 UTC,That would actually be more valuable than bulk commons
MagicCardPulls,3b0bhk,Idras_Hairline,2,Thu Jun 25 00:45:13 2015 UTC,"Nah, just the little box near the top was lands. And it had a few full arts :)"
MagicCardPulls,3b0bhk,Brawler_1337,4,Wed Jun 24 23:55:56 2015 UTC,Pics of the pulls or they didn't happen.
MagicCardPulls,3b0bhk,LvLy,0,Fri Jun 26 05:39:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, soon as I get home"

MagicCardPulls,3b0bhk,Voondab4,2,Wed Jun 24 23:59:49 2015 UTC,let us know if you find anything noteworthy.
MagicCardPulls,3b0bhk,Ghotifett,5,Thu Jun 25 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry for double reply, but just found a serum visions, 😊"
MagicCardPulls,3ay6cw,Corlando,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:19:17 2015 UTC,This is actually the first planeswalker I have ever pulled too! I was just telling the owner of my LGS that as I bought it.
MagicCardPulls,3aunaa,Brogenitus,5,Tue Jun 23 17:22:29 2015 UTC,Did you just find these singles in the thrift store? Or did you find packs? What area did you find them in?
MagicCardPulls,3aunaa,Scroachity,3,Tue Jun 23 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"I picked these singles out by hand. They were just sitting in large box behind the counter, which I asked to look through."
MagicCardPulls,3aunaa,Scroachity,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:34:18 2015 UTC,That's awesome! Congrats!
MagicCardPulls,3aunaa,danjr321,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:53:04 2015 UTC,Looks like one hell of a deal. Good find.
MagicCardPulls,3aunaa,OneLeggedPigeon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:46:49 2015 UTC,It was an awesome deal. I'm heading back tomorrow to search the rest and will post more pics if I find anything else that is notable.
MagicCardPulls,3aunaa,benny3932,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:57:52 2015 UTC,I would have just sat there and gone through it then and there. Remember even good commons and uncommon are worth picking up.  Spell pierce is worth like 2 bucks. Bought 30 copies at the flea market for like a dollar
MagicCardPulls,3aunaa,Kuniotchi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:45:22 2015 UTC,Anything good from the second search?
MagicCardPulls,3aunaa,dexter109,-4,Tue Jun 30 23:10:42 2015 UTC,Thats like 300$ worth of cards...
MagicCardPulls,3aunaa,nickelbake95,5,Tue Jun 23 21:42:17 2015 UTC,uh think your math is off a little there. he probabaly saved like $30 - $40
MagicCardPulls,3apitx,agnl,5,Mon Jun 22 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"So I was at the shop and I said to the guy behind the counter ""Hey man, I'll take a 2015 Core set pack"" and he was like ""OK, or you could go all in."" I mentioned that I probably shouldn't and he was trying to convince me under the premise of ""you never know, you might get that goyf!"". Finally, I sighed, and said ""Alright, hand me the box."". I dug around for a bit and grabbed the pack I thought looked the best. He rang me up and said ""I wanna see you open that."" I open it, flip immediately to back. Cue freakout and me profusely thanking the store employee for his sale skills. 10/10 would shop at outer planes again."
MagicCardPulls,3apitx,Zurgo_Shitposter,8,Mon Jun 22 13:31:12 2015 UTC,In every other parallell universe this ends with you cursing Outer Planes for being pushy grifters. Congrats on the pull though!
MagicCardPulls,3apitx,Zurgo_Shitposter,3,Mon Jun 22 15:13:21 2015 UTC,Pretty much haha but in his defence the dude was less i-need-to-sell-more pushy and more jokey pushy. Nice username by the way.
MagicCardPulls,3apitx,DaFaqPony,4,Mon Jun 22 17:25:20 2015 UTC,Why thank you. I live up to the name quite regularly.
MagicCardPulls,3apitx,nilamo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:17:26 2015 UTC,Gahh!! You lucky sob I've been trying and no luck yet.
MagicCardPulls,3apitx,Idras_Hairline,3,Mon Jun 22 21:04:00 2015 UTC,"You envy me, but at that moment I felt sadness. I knew that that was the pinnacle of my luck and that I will now forever be chasing the dragon. It's like people who win the lottery and then go into massive debt."
