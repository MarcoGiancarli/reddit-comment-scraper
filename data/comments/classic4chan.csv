Like the whole movie makes it seem like Jews are getting retribution for WW2 so everyone's like, ""Wow that's a crazy alt history"" but then the end twist shows that our history is the alt."
classic4chan,3dtzt0,brallipop,2,Sun Jul 19 18:23:02 2015 UTC,"the film is reaching its climax. Our protagonist John storms into a facility with a small company of soldiers as they fight off the enemy and barricade the door behind them.  ""This is it"" says John.  The camera pans over as we see an enormous capsule-like Machine  ""This was the device our Intel was talking about, a way to go back and end this war before it even started""   John and his team setup around the device and quickly begin setting everything up. Just as John is preparing to step in a lone enemy sniper shoots him in the back. The soldiers return fire killing the sniper. John lays on the ground and calls his men around him  ""Sorry boys, i didn't want to do this, I didn't want to put any of you through this but I need one of you to go through with this, I won't make it""  the soldiers all look nervously amongst themselves, to see if they deem themselves worthy, finally a lone soldier stands in the back.  ""I'll do it sir""  John nods and hands the soldier the device and helps him get into the machine  ""You know what you have to do right?"" John says. ""You have to make sure, none of these bastards ever existed to do this to us all. But the time you're going back to, they don't know about all of this, they will think you're crazy and evil. I'm sorry""  John breaks down in tears  ""Don't worry sir"" says the soldier. ""I'm willing to make this sacrifice if it means that we can all live in peace one day""  John smiles and hugs the man  ""Godspeed Adolf, you will never be forgotten""  the machine hums to life and in a flash of electricity, the soldier is gone. Somewhere in the early 1900s Berlin, a flash of light is seen as a orb forms on the ground. We see the soldier rise from the ground and look around him. He sees a newspaper on the ground and reads the date.  ""This time... Things will be right""  Cut to black and roll credits"

classic4chan,3d76q2,JManRomania,-4,Fri Jul 17 20:18:35 2015 UTC,Haha. It's interesting. There are countries where punching a woman is illegal.
classic4chan,3d76q2,ryuzaki49,5,Fri Jul 17 21:41:03 2015 UTC,"There's countries where they cut off little girls' clits, and sew up their vaginas.   There's countries where you can rape your wife, because all marital sex is legal.   There's countries where you can marry a little girl.  There's countries where you can beat your wife.  There's countries where women have to wear their niqab or burqa, or they face heavy punishment.  It's not a coincidence that most of these countries have all of these fucked-up practices.   Now, what countries outlaw punching women?  I'm willing to wager at least some of them also have the practices I outlined above."
classic4chan,3d76q2,JManRomania,4,Fri Jul 17 21:49:28 2015 UTC,"You argue that there are places where punching women is illegal. Prove it - tell us where exactly.  If you're referring to the commonplace law, yes, it is illegal to punch women without a reason, just out of the blue; that's more than harassment. But say a woman punched you out of nowhere. Would you simply do nothing like the skin-and-bones white knight you are? Fuck no. It's perfectly legal in most of the first-world regions of the world to hit a woman if you're doing so to defend yourself or temporarily stun and disable her from aggressing again.  Now, let's redefine the OP's scenario: Anon calls his dad to say that he's going to see Nicole, whom of course he's almost infinitely in love with, and propose to her. He says that his dad is completely welcome to tag along, but his stepmother is out of the question. Anon and Nicole come back home to see - lo and behold - his stepmother. If front of Nicole, she tells Anon that he cannot marry Nicole because of her choice to use medicine rather than ~prayer~.  Pause right there and let's discuss the matters here: Anon has loved Nicole for a few years now, and they fit perfectly together. Suddenly, she get's cancer. Beforehand, Anon has been wanting to propose to her for quite some time, I mean, clearly they fit like an inseparable jigsaw. Then here comes the uninvited stepmother to declare that Anon cannot marry such a sweet, delicate, suddenly fragile and dying girl because of her choice in how to fix such problems. Just for that only reason. Clearly any stepson of hers if she had any others would've decked her by then, and Anon fills that opportunity. Just a matter of a sudden hormonal, endorphinic  fluctuation generating a blossoming rage...he couldn't've not punched her!  And he wouldn't get arrested for just a simple deck. If he were to mortar-and-pestle her face into a pulp, that would definitely be illegal.  Also recall /u/JManRomania's comment below. Sometimes illegalities don't mean shit - many second and third world countries have it at the worst."

While it's entirely possible The Cake's aura of intimidation leaves him without confidants, it doesn't seem to concern him. At the same time, nobody's asked, just in case he's sensitive on the subject, and also because asking ""Hey, bro, do you frequently feel a lack of emotionally meaningful relationships has negatively impacted your life"" is fucking retarded.  The Cake has never been seen in high school. Or any school. Probably because The Cake doesn't live around here. Rumor has it he dropped out of school to sell drugs after his parents went to prison, which is also retarded, but should work great for this fucked-up angsty The Cake fan fiction you seem to have going.  It wouldn't be the first one, either.

classic4chan,3d38w9,the6crimson6fucker6,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:12:03 2015 UTC,"In France, you can't buy alcohol (in markets or in bars) if you're under 18 anymore. And the people selling alcohol must show a sign that explains it. You also can't get drunk in public anymore, etc. All of this because of some dumb law Sarkozy passed a few years ago.  Some bartenders are cooler than others and will serve you (not if you ask for a whisky, but a panaché or a beer perhaps). But they take a risk doing so.  Most parents are cool with their sons trying wine at family dinners at 14. Beer is mostly okay at 15/16; and that's also when teen parties begin (with other alcohols and sometimes weed)."

classic4chan,3ctijg,Maziekit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:41:49 2015 UTC,"But it's only when viewing them through imgur's interface, and there are very specific reasons for it.   Zooming is somehow really difficult, for example, and the images are invariably either low res or take forever to pop in to a higher resolution (I don't know if there's a word for that, but it's like texture pop-in in video games). Moving the image to look at different parts of it on my goddamn two-inch, shit-caked screen causes it to be replaced with a low-res copy until I remove my finger, which means I can't just move the picture and read all at once and I have to wait for it to return to normal resolution again. It's just so goddamn painful and I don't understand why."

From what I remember, it basically came down to a 2x2 grid where you could categorize every student. It had a ""teacher"" axis and a ""student"" one, the categorization of each row was ""loved by"" or ""hated by"". So, basically, you could a say a bullied nerd is loved by teachers but hated by students. A classic bully jock like in the movies would be loved by students, hated by teachers.  The ""popular type"" existed as the one who participated in sports/arts, school projects and academics. He'd be loved by both and try to make the place better for everybody. I can see alpha bro being one of those."
