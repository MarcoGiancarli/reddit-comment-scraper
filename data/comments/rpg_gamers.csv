rpg_gamers,3e5cm8,Andromansis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:06:21 2015 UTC,"I like the concepts in this game, but the execution just killed it for me. There are a couple problems that have kept me from booting it up every day.   1) The graphics are alright, but anytime there is any kind of cutscene I can't help but notice the horrible shading and textures on the character models. It' looks like they were airbrushed through a fine metal mesh (especially the hair).   2) The combat is cool, but there is tons of input lag whenever you do something. Feels like I'm having battles while submerged in half-set jello.   3) There is currently no way to unlock the mouse from camera movement without going into the menus. This means that you cannot mouse over any buffs/debuffs on the screen to see what they do. Leading to confusion. Which leads me to the last and most disappointing point:   4) The game does a horrible job of explaining the different UI elements. Oftentimes you just have to figure out for yourself what certain graphics represent or even how certain things function in the game. Basic information is few and far between. When they do tell you something, they do not go into any sort of detail.  Overall, the game has promise, but it needs some major work before I could stand playing it for more than a couple hours."
rpg_gamers,3e5cm8,Malkron,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:18:53 2015 UTC,3 friends and I played about 20 hours worth while at a 4 day lan party and loved it all.  The skill tree and unlocking classes is quite a nice carrot to chase and the combat is really fun for an mmo.  I might put down ff14 to play this instead.
rpg_gamers,3e66pc,Thanmarkou,2,Wed Jul 22 06:56:20 2015 UTC,YES! Hopefully this will help to convince all of my friends who has not tried it to give it a shot.

rpg_gamers,3e3edz,bavarian,4,Tue Jul 21 18:39:38 2015 UTC,"This is the same type of game as Dark Souls, right? i.e. brutal difficulty :)"
rpg_gamers,3e3edz,jacobuj,4,Tue Jul 21 18:47:20 2015 UTC,Bloodborne is fantastic and easily the best exclusive on the PS4 in my humble opinion. I've put over 100 hours into it and still go back.
rpg_gamers,3e3edz,ffsshhgrgl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:45 2015 UTC,How close is the gameplay to DS?
rpg_gamers,3e3edz,jacobuj,5,Tue Jul 21 19:50:23 2015 UTC,"Smoother. Cleaner, better planned out in terms of how fast you can execute something. It's still brutal, but not because the ui feels slow. It's now 300% more about that wolfman who just ate your face being too good."
rpg_gamers,3e3edz,jacobuj,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:10 2015 UTC,"So my question is - DS2: Scholar of the First Sin, or Bloodborne? I haven't played either?"
rpg_gamers,3e3edz,bavarian,2,Tue Jul 21 22:06:36 2015 UTC,Definitely Bloodborne. Best entry point in the series for newcomers.
rpg_gamers,3e3edz,F117Landers,2,Tue Jul 21 22:16:10 2015 UTC,"It is very similar, but has a far more aggressive combat style and faster dodging. Overall smoother. It also has incredible lore and atmosphere."
rpg_gamers,3e3edz,jacobuj,4,Tue Jul 21 22:15:24 2015 UTC,Yeah its not the easiest game on the market...I'm stuck on the the 3rd or 4th boss. But very fun.

rpg_gamers,3e3edz,IforgotwhatIwasdoing,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:49 2015 UTC,"The game feels much smoother to me personally on ps4, and I think the control scheme is better as well"
rpg_gamers,3e3edz,mysticrudnin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:41:08 2015 UTC,"I can dig it. I have it on 360 and while I enjoyed the controller play immensely, I have a lot more fun grinding rifts and grifts and trying for any kind of seasonal leader board placement. It probably helps that I have literally no friends on PSN or XBL who own it so I repurchased on PC."
rpg_gamers,3e3edz,LilySeki,3,Wed Jul 22 01:51:40 2015 UTC,"Hard to say, comes down to personal preference I think. I look at the console version as a tangential split from the PC version. Both are being updated and supported.   For what it's worth, at no time playing on console did I want to go back to PC, and vice versa."
rpg_gamers,3e3edz,mysticrudnin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:38 2015 UTC,"I think it controls much better with a controller, since you get a new dodge move with the right analog stick that PC doesn't have.   It gets patches slower than PC though."
rpg_gamers,3e1bro,jakepauhl,3,Tue Jul 21 04:57:18 2015 UTC,"This topic has come up a bunch of times so I'll just say what I've said before.  Both are great games, Divinity has a small party 2-4 can be played co-op and has turn based combat with a large focus on the environment and interacting with it (the spell system is very fun) along with puzzles.  Pillars has a more old school feel larger party with pause/real time combat, builds are a little more extensive but fun customisation and classes. Neither has a particularly great story but they're decent enough to carry the game through and I would give the edge to pillars in terms of RP elements as it does have more weighty decisions to be made.  Bare in mind Divinity has a deluxe addition thing coming out soon that address' some faults people had with the game. It's being voiced, having the iffy story somewhat redone and I think they are adding some extra companions. With this in mind I would wait until the new version is out. Pillars has an expansion on it's way so it could be a good time to pick it up."
rpg_gamers,3e1bro,The_Raiff,4,Tue Jul 21 11:22:50 2015 UTC,"im partial to good combat, spell effects, and gear acquisition.   Then you should probably go with D:OS, although I feel the game is designed for 2 players so you should play it with a friend if you have that luxury. The combat is very tactical and the gear acquisition is rewarding.   I personally did not think PoE had that great of a story or RP, but many others enjoyed the game, even those who had not played Baldur's Gate. It's a real time combat system like BG and it's fairly tactical but not quite as fun or balanced as D:OS."
rpg_gamers,3e1bro,stoutcarrot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:11:53 2015 UTC,"I've played through and beat Divinity with my girlfriend and I'm currently playing through Pillars. Honestly, I think Pillars is the better game for single player, but that's based on the merits of the story when compared to Divinity, which I feel has a story that is better suited for co-op (kinda simple, moves along quickly to get into the action).  It sounds like that may or may not be more up your alley though, so it's hard to say. Pillars definitely has more of a D&D feel when it comes to gear, so you very rarely find crazy stuff, whereas there's tons of power gear dropping all the time (though the terberium stuff clearly outclasses everything else)."
rpg_gamers,3e1bro,IndigoMoss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:40:12 2015 UTC,I think both games are about to get major updates in the next month or two.  May want to look into those and see if you want to wait before playing either one.
rpg_gamers,3e1bro,Siltyn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:30 2015 UTC,"Wait with both, as both of them are getting major updates. The one for D:OS will be way bigger though. If you haven't, look into Shadowrun Dragonfall in the meantime."
rpg_gamers,3e1bro,zypsilon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:27:06 2015 UTC,"Divinity: Original Sin hands down. It has great combat, music, coop mode, and I love its silly humor.   Pillars of Eternity is just a mediocre Baldur's Gate wannabe, with worse gameplay and balance (And I'm not even a BG fan, but it's clearly the better game), and its writting and story are not that great (not even compare it to Planescape: Torment)."

I enjoyed the game but I felt it was missing a lot. That being said I think I'll try a replay one day :)  The second I quit playing because it got way too easy. I played on normal but by the time I was at the end of the first world I was 1 hitting everything."
rpg_gamers,3dyl37,steel_shot,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:45 2015 UTC,"The major factors that made me love Two Worlds were:   Exploration and Discovery Leveling and Customizing to my Content (no level cap or class pigeon-holing)   Two Worlds had a huge map to explore and exploring it always led to some type of reward--either gaining levels or finding cool loot.   I could also stumble into an area that was too powerful for me, go do some leveling elsewhere and then come back and wreck shop.  Those two elements are the factors I love most in RPGs. I don't need to be force-fed a good story. Just give me an open playground to get lost in... Give me rewards for being willing to explore the playground... And let me live the power fantasy by leveling and customizing my character the way I want to.  Very few games do this as well as Two Worlds."

rpg_gamers,3dvm80,Sly_Lupin,5,Sun Jul 19 22:14:53 2015 UTC,It's a fun game. It's not as popular as other games because it was never released outside of Japan.
rpg_gamers,3dvm80,YourTheorySucks,3,Sun Jul 19 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"I played Live-A-Live as a kid and even then I had a rough idea in my mind of what it's problems were.  First, in a way it's a pretty great game. Creative. Cool story. Fun concept.  The delivery is a bit meh though. The biggest problem is that because you switch gears to a new scenario so quickly there's never really a point where you can do any serious character building/leveling. As a consequence the game feels more like an interactive movie than a game. You've got some objectives and there's nothing that really needs to/can be done in between them to hedge your odds in the upcoming fights. And there's not really any reason to. You ARE going to win whatever battle gets thrown your way. You're not in much danger of losing. The whole experience ends up feeling just a little bit on rails because of that."
rpg_gamers,3dvm80,Osricthebastard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:55:05 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty great game that needed a sequal to work out all the kinks and weird design choices here and there.

rpg_gamers,3dvm80,HearshotAtomDisaster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:21:39 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend getting a translation patch and playing it, it is an awesome game :D  As mentioned by others, the main reason most don't remember it is it was never translated.  Also, the combat system is fairly different (grid based, with skills attacking certain locations relative to the user and causing different wait times I believe) and it can be easy for a user to dislike one or two time periods and as such stop playing the game due to them, since every time period has it's own ""gimmick."""
rpg_gamers,3dvm80,lmekko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:56:10 2015 UTC,"It's almost perfect on paper, but it definitely falls short on the actual delivery. It's hard to explain why. I agree with the person who said play it and find out, it all made sense to me after playing it through, something about it just never fully comes together.

Just because a game is only released in Japan is no reason for Western audiences not to be familiar with it. Look at the histories of the English-speaking fandom for the Dragon Quest and MegaTen series, for example. Or Mother. Or Type-0 and Demon's Would, for more recent examples."

The writing is spot on excellent and really captures the theme and atmosphere of the PnP games. The only place I feel the game stumbles a bit is the combat mechanics, which can be a bit tedious, but its a minor trouble more than made up with the good writing and character choices.       I share your trepidation with trying out any mods, but if there are any good ones out there I'd want to give them a try. Anybody got any recommendation?"
rpg_gamers,3dsnd5,Morrinn3,3,Sun Jul 19 02:25:05 2015 UTC,"I like the games. They have great writing and are surprisingly immersive. Dragonfall's plot was particularly engaging. No replay value for me, though. Character customization is lacking, and contrary to what you're saying, I don't feel the classes play very differently from each other, especially compared to other modern RPGs. The combat is passable. Nothing new or exciting, but it moves the plot. Both games are also pretty short.  At the end of the day, I'm looking forward to Hong Kong, but I don't mind being a patientgamer and picking it up later in an inevitable sale."

The writing is good, but the quests didn't feel very reactive and I didn't care much for the gameplay.

rpg_gamers,3dsnd5,Sly_Lupin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:16:39 2015 UTC,"I understand that feeling, but after playing dragonfall I got the feeling that Dead Mans Switch was more of a test drive for the studio. Dragonfall patches up some of those problems, particularly the reactive quest thing. You have a hub you frequently return to and the choices you make throughout the game will be reflected in many of the dialogues found there. It's a big step up although some of the other problems you mentioned do persist. If you find yourself unable to get through the original know that Dragonfall is a completely standalone story with no crossover or important recurring characters outside of established Shadowrun lore."
rpg_gamers,3dsnd5,Morrinn3,2,Mon Jul 20 11:32:02 2015 UTC,"My experience with the mods wasn't very good. Most of them are rather poorly designed. One time I remember this situation in which this troll gunfighter forces you into dialogue when you get close to her. After it's over, she becomes hostile and instantly fires two shotgun blasts at your main character. Because you're so close, it's basically an instant kill. Another time there were invisible mines everywhere that pretty much one shots any character. Seriously wtf!  Proceed with caution and be prepared for frustration and/or disappointment.   I'm in the same situation as you. I love these games and am looking for good mods to continue the fun, but I don't like blindly trying them out. So I'm just waiting around for Hong Kong to come out."
rpg_gamers,3dsnd5,MysticExarch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:21 2015 UTC,It's a shame that the devs made the game such a mod friendly thing that there aren't any great mods out yet. Hopefully one day...

The only place he's ever successfully been a hero is in his favourite video game--and when that game starts suddenly and inexplicably coming to life, Larry and his party of motley sidekicks suddenly find themselves the only ones around with the know-how to save their home town from chaos, destruction, and the ultimate Game Over...  The project:   The webseries will be coming out in September, in ten ten(ish) minute installments. As anyone whose seen the D&D movie(s) will remember, movie adaptations of role playing games tend not to work very well, and one of the things we were really keen on doing was finding a way to properly capture the fun and excitement (and occasional frustration) of playing an RPG in live action.   It was made on slightly less than a shoestring budget, and we want the whole project to have an inclusive, communal vibe, so we'll be releasing lots of behind the scenes information--and if anyone has any suggestions for the kind of bonus content you'd like to see from a webseries like this, we'd love to hear from you."

rpg_gamers,3dq29v,UnorusJanco,2,Mon Jul 20 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"Excellent! We pride ourselves on appealing to the discerning viewer. Also, I'll let the director know you're interested in the pixel transitions; he might do a tutorial on them when we're releasing behind the scenes content."

rpg_gamers,3do26z,Zim5,8,Fri Jul 17 21:05:29 2015 UTC,"Witcher 3 is this weird amalgamation of the best parts of Dark Souls, Dragon Age, and Assassin's Creed without really any of the weaknesses of those series.  From your writing it sounds like gameplay depth is the most important to you. Go with Dark Souls 1, or if you have a PS3, Demon's Souls. I'd advise against Dark Souls 2, at least for now. It's a beautiful game and the story/world is just as good as 1, albeit in a different way (I like to say DS1 feels like an ancient legend while DS2 feels like a fairy tale), but I think the enemy design and a lot of other changes they made are a turn for the worse and kind of lazy development-wise. DS1 and Demon's Souls had a variety of tactics necessary in the different environments and enemy types whereas 2 very quickly becomes about ""throw a bunch of unstaggerable enemies with giant weapons at you and see how many action rolls you can do."" It stops being about spacing and risk calculation and just turns into roll-or-die every single fight.  But yeah, as far as action RPGs go that's your ticket. I like to describe Dark Souls as basically Zelda for adults. It's a good game, though the circlejerk for it does tend to go a little beyond what it actually deserves. The combat in Witcher 2 and 3 is basically Dark Souls but with a ton of animation fluidity and responsiveness added to make Geralt feel more agile and powerful, whereas in the Souls games animations are very intentionally stiff with a lot of recovery to make your character feel less powerful and like you're constantly fighting an uphill battle to stay alive against overwhelming adversity."
rpg_gamers,3do26z,ginja_ninja,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:15:13 2015 UTC,"For DS and DS2, if you want a real challenge (especially in DS2) use as few magic/faith abilities as possible."

Keep in mind Ys 1 &  2 are different from others since those use basic bump combat.   Bayonetta 2 isn't a RPG but it's a great action game thst fits your bill. Xenoblade Chronicles and its upcoming sequel is playable on Wii U or N3DS."
rpg_gamers,3do26z,Brihag93,2,Fri Jul 17 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"Play dark souls and set the 'prepare to cry' playlist on by vaatividya. The combat in the game is fantastic and your mind will be blown with the way that plot can be interpreted. The combat in dark souls is very very good. You can make pretty much any weapon viable, I mean look at the YouTube/twitch streamer LobosJr he beat the game with pretty much anything and everything. The combat also does not get too stale, you won't be overpowered at any point of the game, even if you do get the drake sword for instance even though you'll be able to one shot pre anor londo you will still die if you fuck up."
rpg_gamers,3do26z,metagloria,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:13:14 2015 UTC,"For combat that never feels easy (Until you're soul level 100+ and murdering/defending other players for kicks) I would second Dark Souls and it has several NG+ modes that will make the game more challenging.  Because OP says they don't replay I would suggest Dark Souls 2 over 1, because DS2 has an item that lets you NG+ an area multiple times to respawn the mobs and make it more challenging. This will let them make an area that is 'too easy' (yeah right!) harder again and respawn the mobs and area boss; without having to beat the game first."
rpg_gamers,3do26z,llsektorll,2,Sat Jul 18 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"Dragons dogma - dark arisen and dark souls...best recommendation I can give. If you like Baldurs gate and old crpgs, give PoE a shot, maybe torchlight if you like Diablo."
rpg_gamers,3do26z,Roike,2,Sat Jul 18 12:00:20 2015 UTC,"If you like Witcher 3 but disliked DA: Inquisition, it sounds like you prefer action games with slight RPG elements, rather than RPG games with slight action elements.   Personally, I have opposite tastes than yours. What I can do though is work backwards and recommend games I didn't like for being too action-oriented. Take my advice with a grain of salt, though. I'm not a good critic in this field.    First of all, have you played Witcher 1 and 2? If you like 3 you may like these as well. Witcher 1 is clickfest, and I'm not sure what genre to call it actually. The story is solid, though and it's the only thing that kept me playing. Witcher 2 is definitely an ARPG. Be warned though, it's very hard. Can't comment on the story at all as I didn't play it for very long. Bastion. A good beat-em up game where you can customize weapons and stats a little bit. Has one of the best stories told in gaming and beautiful scenery and music. I liked this one for the latter rather than the former, but the gameplay should appeal to you strongly. This is probably my strongest recommendation to you.  Dark Souls 1 and 2, as well as Demon Souls. These are pretty much the quintessential ARPG games. They're some of the hardest games ever. They should be right up your alley on gameplay. However, from what I've heard, most of the story is told through item flavor text. Not sure if that would qualify for you definition of a good story (it doesn't for mine.) Have you tried Dragon Age 2? Although the first one was very tactical, the second one is a lot more like a hack n' slash. It has some traces of tactical elements though, I have no idea if it's too much for you or not. Can't comment on the story. What about the Elder Scrolls series? The combat is pretty basic. I don't know what you mean by ""deep combat system"" or if these games would qualify. You might not like the system, but the gameplay is heavily hack n' slash for sure. Maybe worth looking into. Decent story.  The Fable series is a pretty pure ARPG series. It's a little cartoony and doesn't take itself seriously. I'm not if you like that kind of thing or not, but it's worth a glance. Decent story too.  Dead Island is an extremely actiony series with some skill trees that have abilities all focused around combat. It's first person though, not sure if that's what you want. It has a decent story.   That's all I can recommend, as I don't normally play this genre. I hope these are good recommendations for you, if not, I'm sorry but this is the best I can do."
rpg_gamers,3do26z,pilgrimboy,3,Sun Jul 19 23:02:01 2015 UTC,You can try the Dark Souls series...The world is interesting but the story is a bit hard to piece together. But there is a huge community that helps with everything from lore to bosses to where to trigger sidequests

rpg_gamers,3dk6rk,AspsVeryDangerous,7,Thu Jul 16 23:51:10 2015 UTC,Thanks. Based on this I am definitely going to play it. :)
rpg_gamers,3dk6rk,Pixeleyes,4,Fri Jul 17 00:35:06 2015 UTC,"I've played through a few times, the gameplay is essentially Diablo but the setting and story are very interesting. Most of the game is set in the modern era."

rpg_gamers,3dk6rk,MarylandMaverick,5,Fri Jul 17 13:28:49 2015 UTC,"Awesome game but the unofficial patch is pretty essential, and to get the most out of it you need to play through it three times: once as any clan apart from malkavian or nosferatu for the first time, then once for each of the latter.

Just as a quick tip, there's a small spelling error: when you are defeated, it says ""loose"" instead of ""lose"".  If we have suggestions, how would you prefer us to contact you?  edit:  Biggest problem so far is that the medic is actually the worst at healing himself. Not sure what your design philosophy is for the abilities of the three professions but the medic's healing ability definitely needs a buff, or the other healing abilities need a nerf."

If you liked Faxanadu, you may like the old Dragon Slayer japanese saga (DS4 aka Legacy of the Wizard is great, but very light with its RPG mechanics). Then, there's the Wonder Boy in Monster Land saga, those have no stats, but you can buy better gear and find hearts, not unlike Zelda.

Kornstalx's HotKeys - Right click to adjust camera angle instead of middle key, and makes highlight hotkey toggable instead of press and hold. VERY USEFUL.  http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/other/kornstalxs-hotkeys-nwn2  .  Rod of preparation - Autobuffer, save time and finger, essential for any modules.  http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/other/gui/rod-preparation  .  NWN2 creature distant tweak - No more over-crowded confused combat, helps quite a bit in the original campaign  http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/other/nwn2-creature-distance-tweaks-v02  .  TonyK AI - I like to have control over most things but this is still useful for the autoswitch AI so I don't need to micromanage every party members' weapon when I face a monster with DR. Also greatly improves monsters AI. The downside of this mod is that it interferes with tchos hd ui panels but with a bit of xml editing you can get it to work pretty well  http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/script/companion-and-monster-ai-22  .  Less obtrusive spell effects - More easily see which buffs you have active.  http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/other/visual-effect/less-obtrusive-spell-buffs  .  --Graphics Mods--  Link to a thread with almost all the graphical enhancement mods I use  http://www.gnd-tech.com/threads/63893-Neverwinter-Nights-2-Essential-Mods  .  Also, you'll most likely want to check out the modules on the nwnvaultsite, modules are basically whole new campaigns and are usually better than the OC (original campaign) which was pretty crappy imo"

rpg_gamers,3dejvj,rpm5368,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:43 2015 UTC,If you're into rping I recommend trying out some of the rp multiplayer servers. The mod that reenables multiplayer is client extension. I'd get you the link but I'm on mobile. Googling nwn2 client extension will get you to it. Dalelands beyond is my go to server. If you see locke on there gimme a pm and I'll help you get started.

I don't think I could immerse myself in a game where the characters sound like they're chatting at me from the next stall over in the bathroom.  Without that unfortunate problem I think the game would probably be solid. I'd give it +2/10 on whatever score it gets for switching from voice acting to scrolling text; this VA actively hurts the game for me.

rpg_gamers,3d3ohf,Avrozavr,12,Mon Jul 13 07:09:34 2015 UTC,"By an large what makes a jrpg a jrpg is the grinding, or rather the slow incremental growth of your character.  They are also very story driven usually.  I have found that it is much tougher now as a 30 year old to get through them then when I was a 13 year old.   Probably a time thing."
rpg_gamers,3d3ohf,Roike,6,Mon Jul 13 07:26:09 2015 UTC,"""Grinding"" isn't synonymous with a slow incremental growth of your character.  Usually people use the term grinding to mean repeating the same actions over and over for no other reason than to levelup.  There are some RPGs where the battles you complete in the course of going on a beeline from point A to B to C through the story are more than enough to keep you leveled.  There are some RPGs where you have to stop story progression and wander around, finding random encounters, before you enter the door of the next major plot point."

rpg_gamers,3d3ohf,mysticrudnin,6,Mon Jul 13 21:15:58 2015 UTC,"I hate random encounters and grinding as much as you do so maybe I can help.  There are many JRPGs that either don't have those elements, or are minimized in some way.  But let me say first some concessions I've made:   For random encounters, I do accept random encounters, as long as they can be bypassed. For example, some games give you random encounters up to a certain point in which the area is considered 'clear' (though many times if you leave the area and come back, the counter resets). Others have items that stop or reduce it. And yet other games just don't have them. For grinding, some games still have grinding for optional stuff, so if you're a completionist you will have to grind to kill the 'optional bosses' or the 'true end game'. The worst problem is the latter, I want to see the 'true end game' but I don't want to mindlessly grind, so what I do is I go for the 'normal end game' and then go to youtube and search for '<name of game> true end game' and watch the cutscenes there, saves me from hours of grind.   As for the games, my favorite JRPGs would be Suikoden 3 (5 wasn't bad either), Final Fantasy 9, Final Fantasy 10, Shadow Hearts 2, Star Ocean 4, Valkyria Chronicles, Persona 3 & 4, Gladius (though this one is not so much JRPGs more like tactical RPG, but really tactical)."

rpg_gamers,3d3ohf,mysticrudnin,3,Mon Jul 13 12:28:14 2015 UTC,Valkyria Chronicles isn't really a JRPG as it is a tactical/strategy RPG (it's similar to Fire Emblem with a pretty unique battle system). I would definitely recommend the game but I'm not sure that's really what you're looking for.  I'm personally a big fan of the Tales series. The fight system tends to make the grinding less painful and some of the stories are pretty unique

rpg_gamers,3d3ohf,Dragonzeanse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:34:24 2015 UTC,I'm looking on kingdom hearts for some time now. It seems good! p beat first pokemon on a gameboy color it was great! I was grinding then though.
rpg_gamers,3d3ohf,Dragonzeanse,3,Mon Jul 13 12:49:38 2015 UTC,"More recent Pokemon games (the 3DS ones, specifically) have almost entirely removed the grind by giving you an item that more generously shares experience after battles with your party. I didn't even have it turned on for my whole playthrough in Pokemon X and I never once had to stop and grind. I think I was a good 10-15 levels higher than the Elite Four when I made it to the end of the game. If grinding is a big issue but you liked Pokemon otherwise, give the newest ones a try."

rpg_gamers,3d3ohf,gianttabby,4,Tue Jul 14 06:30:45 2015 UTC,"Suikoden 2 is also a great one from the era. Many don't age well however as we as gamers have changed along with the industry that supports us. Sadly today it's slim pickings as far as new games. I mean it's pretty much just the Tales series, not sure if I even want to think about calling FFXIII a JRPG.   Unfortunately the genre has not advanced as quickly, while it used to be a darling of gamers it's now just a niche. Great JRPG's in the past 10 years would be.... Ni No Kuni, Persona 3/4, Xenoblade? For me, can include Valkyria Chronicles but it's more of a SRPG. I'm sure there are others but those are the only ones that stand out for me. The last Final Fantasy that I really enjoyed was X. I own several Tales games, I find them.......ok but the themes and the stories and the cliches never matured. They are still made for the 12 year old me.   Final Fantasy  Star Ocean  Suikoden  Dragon Quest  Valkyrie games  Lunar series  Chrono games  Phantasy Star games  All these were fantastic franchises that either fell of the radar or completely died.   Wish me for some JRPG revival. Sadly either newcomers are lackluster (Xenosaga and White Knight Chronicles) or.....Xenoblade....Fantastic game, a perfect mashup of JRPG and WRPG and it gets released on the Wii and Wii-u as an exclusive...... If that had been released on PS3/4/XB it really could have opened the doors for some others. Sadly though it will be remembered as one of the best games paired with the worst possible systems to sell it. Wii sold what 80 million consoles? Less than 1 million copies of Xenoblade moved. It's well known that 3rd party titles performed poorly on Wii. Well, the sequel and Wii-U.....what's to say?"

Sounds weird but you really get attached to the characters, Persona 3 especially has a really epic soundtrack but Persona 4 is more polished and probably the better of the 2 overall. The dungeon crawler aspect of the games sadly, have not aged well and feel a bit tedious.   And yes, if you haven't played Xenoblade, you need to. It's really really good! I found it a bit ugly on my Wii so I used the Dolphin emulator, looks much better on my PC. (I own a copy of the game)."

There's been 3 iterations of the Xeno franchise   Xenogears for the PS1 which was a fantastic game  Xenosaga series (3 games) for the PS2, good games, not great. even had it's own Anime.  Xenoblade and Xenoblade X for the Wii/WiiU respectively. Also fantastic games.   My understanding is that there was never a true Xenogears sequel due to licensing issues but Xenosaga and Xenoblade were created by Monolith Soft who were folks that created Xenogears but then left Square to form their own studio."

Once you have a ton of knowledge about how the genre tends to work, you can bypass the grinding in almost all of the games.  I think you might consider looking at Tales. The combat is active, so ""twich skill"" (rather than RPG knowledge) tends to take the front seat, and most of them do not have random encounters. In addition, many of the modern ones tell you exactly what element your weapons and attacks are, and tell you what the enemies use and are weak to.  Examples of other games you like that aren't JRPGs might help as well. I can make more pinpointed suggestions, because there are many, many types of JRPGs. You could realistically be a fan and never touch a single game with random encounters."

Also just check some reviews first, there were a lot of main games and spin-offs and some might fit and some might not.   Tales of Hearts, Tales of Innocence and apparently the spin-off game Tales of Tempest were released for the DS. I hope they were also all released on the DS in the west - Tales of Hearts was first released on DS in Japan only and had a re-release on the Vita, but I think also had one on the DS.   I did play the first game of the extensive series, which I liked, titled Tales of Phantasia, which was re-released on the GBA. It's good if you don't mind old school, but if that didn't bother you with Chrono Trigger then I guess that's fine.   Pretty much every (console) gaming platform had at least one.   Check the wiki for an overview:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_(series)  The thing for combat in my experience,... you can pretty much bash ""A"" and get through the game (mostly). :D"

Hironobu Sakaguchi the producer of Final Fantasy games at Squaresoft (before they acquired Enix) left after FF9. He stated it his favorite and for good reason. It is a throw back to the classics with refined mechanics.  FF9 unlike FF7 and FF8 starts off in a more classic story book fantasy plot. Where a thief helps a princess escape her overprotected life and gets wrapped in a massive plot spanning 4 CDs to save the world.

rpg_gamers,3d3ohf,Red-Blue-,3,Tue Jul 14 06:31:10 2015 UTC,"Whatever you do, don't pick up Breath of Fire 2. I'm playing through that, and its encounter rate is almost unacceptably high.  Try Xenoblade Chronicles, if you have a Wii. That game is praised as an evolution of JRPGs, and you can see your encounters before starting battle. It also got a port to the New 3DS, so if you want it on the go, there's that. Xenoblade Chronicles X, its sequel, will be out on Wii U this December in North America and Europe.  The Paper Mario series is also quite good, but the first two are the only true JRPGs in the series. You can spot encounters ahead of time, and even take initiative by attacking them in the overworld before they attack you. The efficacy of attacks are based on QTEs, but will (usually) be successful regardless of failure. Paper Mario games, since then, aren't quite the same: the one on Wii is something of a platformer, and Sticker Star on the 3DS doesn't really resemble the originals. Paper Mario started on Nintendo 64, and its true sequel was on Gamecube.  My favorite JRPGs are, really, RPGs from Japan that don't follow traditional JRPG formula, such as Final Fantasy Tactics. It plays more like XCOM, than anything. It definitely doesn't follow standard JRPG fare. I only played Tactics Advance, which was on Game Boy Advance. It had a sequel, called Grimoire of the Rift, on Nintendo DS. The original is on Playstation and PSN, with an enhanced port called War of the Lions on PSP.  Persona 3 and 4 are quite good, as well. Persona 3 FES is available on PS2 and PSN, which is just Persona 3 with extra content. Persona 4 Golden is an enhanced port of Persona 4 to PS Vita, also with additional content. In both games, you can spot and avoid encounters, or take the initiative, and the dungeons you crawl through are procedurally generated. Not only that, but it has visual novel flair to break up the monotony, which also allows you to improve the different Persona you use to fight in battle, should you pursue them. I've not played other Shin Megami Tensei games, which the Persona series is a part of. A Wii U title called Shin Megami Tensei x Fire Emblem is coming out towards the end of the year. It looks a lot more like Persona than either SMT or FE, but without personas, if that makes any sense.  One more suggestion I have is Bravely Default. It still has random encounters and grinding, but the battle system has enough tactical depth to keep you encouraged to play. It's pretty much the best Final Fantasy that Square Enix has released in years, so long as you can stomach those random battles. The job system adds a lot of depth, as well, which was also present in Final Fantasy Tactics. Bravely Default is a 3DS title."

rpg_gamers,3d3ohf,vidurnaktis,2,Tue Jul 14 06:44:32 2015 UTC,"I only ever played the GBA version. If you decide to play any version, I would choose that. It has a system called ""Laws"" in it, which revolve and dictate which moves you can and can't perform in certain battles. Without wishing to spoil anything, there are some areas in the game where these are null, but the battles are more ""stressful,"" for lack of a better term. Characters who break the law are penalized with a yellow card, or jailed with a red one, and need to be bailed out of prison for a fee. Grimoire of the Rift has this, as well, but the original does not and neither does War of the Lions. The choice is really up to you, but they play similarly regardless.  That said, War of the Lions is for sale on iOS and Android, and you really only have two choices for Advance: GBA, or its sequel on the DS. I still recommend the PSP version, as besides Square Enix's poor history with mobile devices, most of its aggregate reviews on Metacritic describe it as a lackluster port."

Otherwise, I agree that I would want full party control, but I would accept something like Baldur's Gate RTWP or a Tales of Games/Star Ocean ability to pause and assign commands through the entire party in the menus. I think we have seen the ability of Real time games to implement entire party control and since they publish Star Ocean we know SE is aware of it.  ...but yeah the best way for them to keep everyone happy is to probably keep ATB."

Now I still would greatly prefer a turn-based system, but there is a ton of work they could put into it, and it wouldn't be change for the sake of change, it would be keeping up with developments in the JRPG space. FFVII has flaws."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,eternalaeon,3,Sun Jul 12 09:33:49 2015 UTC,The only 'modern' FF game I've played is 13-2. It was only OK. If they change VII to be more like their newer games then I doubt it's going to be better than the original.

Piss a shit ton of people off, but it could be really fun.  I would love a turn based game where positioning matters like FFT or Real time game like Secret of Mana where your friends could control the other two party members. That was always the strategic element I missed in mainline FF, range and positioning and I would welcome that into a FFVII remake."

rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,Climhazard,3,Sun Jul 12 07:22:26 2015 UTC,"But then why even get the game? You are just paying money for FFVII with prettier graphics at that point? You could get the PC version and graphics mod it right now and not worry about them throwing weird Compilation retcons into the story.  They can make some improvements with VII combat system (note this doesn't mean it wouldn't be ATB) so that the game can actually provide something new, otherwise I don't see any point in playing it instead of playing one of the myriad of copies of FFVII that I already own because Square keeps re-releasing them.  ...which is why I kind of don't get why people even care about this remake and still want the gameplay to remain the same as the original."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,Phoxxent,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:49:46 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of things they could do. The combat system was iconic to that game, and most importantly, fun. It shouldn't be changed.  But mods won't reach the level of graphics that a ps4 remake will. They also won't have voicework or animation like the developers could make. We could bow explore the world better, have a great view of it. There are plenty of reasons we want a remake on a new system, but changing things that are a base to the game will not make people love it. They want a better looking version of an older game. That is why people buy stuff like the last of us on ps4, it was not much different other than better graphics. For people who don't see the point, well, its not for you."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,cyborgmermaid,4,Mon Jul 13 00:35:02 2015 UTC,"For fucks sake VII used Active Time Battle, not turned based.  Fuck."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,mysticrudnin,3,Sun Jul 12 14:35:53 2015 UTC,"It is still turn based it's just that the turns aren't in a pre determined order. A character's ATB gauge fills up, you select what action you want them to take, and then they take their turn. It's really just semantics at this point.   When most people say they want it to stay turn based they mean they want it to keep an ATB like system and not move to an ARPG real time battle system."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,RumpleCragstan,2,Sun Jul 12 17:35:43 2015 UTC,Well maybe we want true turn based.
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,mysticrudnin,4,Sun Jul 12 16:37:33 2015 UTC,People still think ATB is turn-based?
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,allwaysnice,8,Sun Jul 12 02:13:23 2015 UTC,"It absolutely is turn based, and I fail to see how it isn't in any conceivable way.  The method of turns coming by is different from FFI-III or FFX, but it is turn based. The bar fills up, you take your turn.  The entire battle system is based around participants taking turns selecting actions.  More to the point, not only is it disingenuous to suggest that the ATB system is ""action"" based, but many of the games allow you to pause battles on menu open, which takes away any bit of action that might have existed.  The problem is in the title, which distinguishes ""real time"" from ""turn based"" when it should (and does in the article) distinguish from ""action"" and ""turn-based"" which is the general vocabulary of the genre. But just because FFIV-IX occur in real time does not make them not turn-based."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,eternalaeon,-2,Sun Jul 12 02:53:04 2015 UTC,"By your logic MMOs are turn based because people are waiting for their cooldowns to recharge. This is silly, and obviously not turn based. ATB is definitely not turn based. You're effectively waiting on cooldowns of entire characters rather than just abilities.   In a truly turn based system, once it's your turn to move you get to move and nobody else gets to go until your turn is over. That's why it's your turn. In a turn based game, time isn't a factor and you can put the controller down to go to the bathroom and when you come back it'll be the same character's activation."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,mysticrudnin,4,Sun Jul 12 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"What is my logic? You've seem to misunderstand this greatly.   You're effectively waiting on cooldowns of entire characters rather than just abilities   Sure. Fine. Let this be the definition of a turn. The cooldown of an entire character.  Your MMO example is nonsense. You are waiting on cooldowns, but while doing so you can still move your character around and do other things, such as swap equipment. There is no ""not your turn"".  Did you know that there are turn-based strategy games where turns are simultaneous? There are also many board games with simultaneous turns, as well. Turns do not mean that ""no one else gets a turn"". The concept of a turn doesn't have to have anything to do with time. Many turn based games happen to be as you describe but it is not a necessity and the very existence of a popular system where this is not the case (ATB) makes this pretty clear to most people outside of the genre.  All a turn is is a binary classification of whether or not a character (/player/whatever) is active. There are many ways for these turns to come about - I've played dozens in my time with RPGs. But regardless, you can separate a character into whether it's their turn or not. You can't do that in any ""active"" games, there simply is no concept of a turn. But with FFVII or whatever else, you can say it's ""Cloud's"" turn. You can say it's ""Tifa's"" turn. You can say it's not ""Barret's"" turn. And even if two have their bars filled at once, you still only have one turn with them, so it still pretty much fits within your definition.  And yes, ""Wait"" exists."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,tylo,0,Sun Jul 12 09:31:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe most people just automatically go to the options and switch it from Active to Wait? I know that was one of the first things I did as a kid.    Actually, reading up on this, apparently there's a section in the wiki with surprisingly lots of styles. Didn't really realize that there were so many. And apparently, technically, ATB is separate from turn-based even if it does feel like that to most."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,mysticrudnin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:01:55 2015 UTC,"but many of the games allow you to pause battles on menu open, which takes away any bit of action that might have existed.   Mass Effect let's you pause battle on menu open as well but I don't see anyone calling that turn based.  If we are going with your definition of turn based have we ever seen an non turn based Final Fantasy? XII and XIII would just be turn based in this conception.  If your argument is really that a turn based game doesn't have to be based on turns, then the term turn-based just becomes a word to throw out for ""games I like"" as opposed to really meaning anything. I think when you have the sentence when you can have the sentence ""just because FFIV-IX occur in real time does not make them not turn-based."" The term turn based doesn't really mean anything anymore. You can have Xenoblade Chronicles,  or any game that limits actions by cool downs be turn based under this definition."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,thevampirelematt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:17:12 2015 UTC,"You can have Xenoblade Chronicles, or any game that limits actions by cool downs be turn based under this definition.   No you can't.  When your cooldowns are not ready in XC you can still position yourself - you can try to get around enemies, you can move next to your allies, you can avoid their attacks. It is not turn-based.  It has nothing to do with ""games I like* - I like and play every JRPG regardless of any other factors.  Some have turns, some do not. FFVII is turn-based.   Mass Effect let's you pause battle on menu open as well but I don't see anyone calling that turn based.   The difference is quite obvious to me. You can fight battles in Mass Effect without ever opening the menu. In Final Fantasy, the menu is literally the gameplay - it must be opened, and pauses every single time. The game pauses for you, to take your turn. ME let's you pause the game. Pausing the game does not make it turn-based. Having game pauses definitely does. Regardless, in Mass Effect you can position yourself and do other things all the time - if it's ""always"" your turn, then there are no turns.   If your argument is really that a turn based game doesn't have to be based on turns   At no point did I suggest this. At all. My argument is that definition is literally only whether there are turns or not, and it doesn't matter how you get to them. FFVII (FFIV-FFIX) clearly have turns.  Real time and turn-based are not opposite concepts. They tend to refer to opposite mechanics (and the existence of things like RTS vs. TBS muddy this - but don't get caught up on genre names, after all we play RPGs which could refer to every game with characters) but they don't have to. As mentioned, there are turn-based strategy games where turns are taken simultaneously, but they are still turn-based. Real time can affect your moves in slight ways.  For another example of common confusion, many people still think ""random battles"" means ""turn-based battles"" but we all know this isn't true.  Paper Mario/M&L/SMRPG are turn-based even though real time affects your actions. (It's also partially an action game, too, even though it's turn-based!) Same with games like Resonance of Fate.  Generally, the opposite of turn-based is ""action"" and that would be your Kingdom Hearts and your Tales of. Even though Tales pauses on menus or target switching, and has cooldowns in a way, you still cannot define the characters as having a turn or not having a turn. In FFVII, you can. Full stop. ""It's not Cloud's turn"" is a statement that absolutely makes sense and you know what that means. ""It's not Lloyd's turn"" is nonsense. But you can say, ""I can't use an item yet."" In XC you can say ""Backstab isn't ready"" but you can't say ""It's not my turn."""
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,mysticrudnin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:45:08 2015 UTC,"You have good arguments and solid examples. The only hole in your argument I could find is this:   The game pauses for you, to take your turn.   The ATB system actually did not pause the enemies taking their turn. You could stand there forever and let the enemies wail on you if you wanted to. It created a sense of urgency to your decisions, at least until you got into a routine. Also your other character's gauges did not pause while you were taking your turn, but continued to fill. Of course, they did (in a sense) pause at being full until you told them what to do.  There was an option in the settings for it to completely pause the battle if you wanted to, though, if I remember right. That was how older FF titles worked."
rpg_gamers,3cyw1u,anonymoussuperman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:25:12 2015 UTC,"Some of them allowed you to set the game to ""Wait"" which sometimes did allow this. Other times it didn't...  It's not well documented how that feature actually worked. But, I had to include it, because I suspect many players used it.   Also your other character's gauges did not pause while you were taking your turn, but continued to fill. Of course, they did (in a sense) pause at being full until you told them what to do.   This depends on the game how this was implemented. It was not the same in all games. FFVIII imo had the best implementation, where bars (and enemies) paused during all animations. FFIX had the worst implementation (again imo) which never paused bars, even during game slowdowns which were plentiful. Haste and Slow effectively did not exist, either, since all animations were so long... plus the way enemy actions queued... it was a mess.  Anyway, ATB didn't end up being one unified system in the end. But in general, it's still turn based."

FF7's musical tone was heavily influenced by synth heavy sci fi movie scores like Blade Runner. The sounds may be ps1 quality midi, but a lot of those sounds don't sound like real instruments because they're not supposed to sound like real instruments. Going in a completely orchestral direction is the obvious choice for Square Enix, and I'd respect it if Uematsu decided he wanted to do that, but I think it'd be really cool if he went for that same plastic 80s synth sound that blade runner had (in addition to the orchestra stuff). With a lot of Final Fantasy orchestrations I feel like people seem to miss some of the magic that Uematsu managed to work with 90s midi sounds. He used a lot of guitars, a lot of electric organs, rhodes pianos, generally weird synths. Uematsu's said many times that his inspirations for music come from 60s pop, to 70s prog rock, to classical music, so for these arrangements to begin and end with a classical music slant is always disappointing."

They've got modern orchestral versions that sound great, but they lack a lot of the atmosphere and personality that the ps1 sounds had. I think those plasticy sounding synths really contributed to the dirty sci-fi atmosphere of Midgar in general.

rpg_gamers,3cvw8w,encapsulationdot1q,4,Sat Jul 11 06:33:52 2015 UTC,They'd probably need a bit of reworking to get them to loop smoothly for gameplay.
rpg_gamers,3cvw8w,ketsugi,3,Sat Jul 11 09:50:06 2015 UTC,"Not every song has an orchestrated remix.  Also, some of the songs are so unique because they are synth in style.  Which I feel Uematsu actually writes better music for synth than orchestra.  Basically, stuff like under the rotting pizza, motorcycle chase or fanfare wouldn't sound right in orchestra.  But Aeris' Theme and Main Theme definitely would sound better orchestrated (as they did on FFVII Reunion).  I guess I'm saying, some should be orchestrated, but others shouldn't be.  I'm more worried that they'll just end up remixing everything, like the music in Advent Children and Crisis Core were punk rock or piano remixes of FFVII songs (and not as good in my opinion)."
rpg_gamers,3cvw8w,maxis2k,2,Sat Jul 11 16:00:43 2015 UTC,"They definitely could, but you never know if they may want ""new"" themes, or remake some others."

rpg_gamers,3cve9x,iZealot86,9,Sat Jul 11 02:26:08 2015 UTC,I think RPG Codex's Top 70 PC RPGs is a much better list than this.

rpg_gamers,3cve9x,thinkforaminute,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"Much better list.  These annual lists focus too much on the hype of recent games to appeal to current audiences while forgetting the classics.  I expect IGN to do something like this but I'm surprised RPS does this as well.  That said, I better see Witcher 3 on that list next year."
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,Makonar,10,Mon Jul 13 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"Oh this list is terrible. Some of the great RPG's are not even on it, while it's filled with roguelikes and very indie / niche games no one ever heard of... I cannot endorce this list, it's not best RPG's, it's a random list of games somebody played."

rpg_gamers,3cve9x,Makonar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:53:49 2015 UTC,"Given the subjective nature of what is and isn't enjoyable to different people it's not hard to not be subjective, it's impossible. Some of the games also needed to be played during their time, and are almost impossible to get into if you try to play them now for the first time. FF7 and the Ultima series are supposed to be great games, but they didn't age well and I've tried multiple times to really get into them without any success."
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,TheCrimsonEscapade,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i played FF7 in 9th grade.  I really it, but never played past the ending or did extra stuff.  FF6 was more my thing anyway.  I played a couple of the Ultimas when I was like 12.  Maybe I was too young.  Didn't really get into them.  Though some games are amazing no matter when you play them.  Recently played PS:T and Systemshock 2 for the first time and they were so good, even now.  Games that are good without the nostalgia factor are true masterpieces."
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,Makonar,2,Sat Jul 11 18:25:03 2015 UTC,It's RPS. I've learned to never read their articles nor take them seriously.
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,errboi,2,Sun Jul 12 19:01:31 2015 UTC,"While I agree that some roguelikes probably shouldn't be there, but I didn't notice anything major missing (maybe Witcher 2?), can you name some others?"
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,Makonar,6,Sat Jul 11 09:02:03 2015 UTC,"The list has a problem when opting with the original or one of the sequels over another. I would walk over this and just inserted series. I don't know why they would Choose Fallout 1 over Fallout 2, when they are both great games, and many would argue that Fallout 2 is better from the original, especially with the missing content patch installed. I am one of the minorieties, who is arguing that 1 is just as good, but majority of my friends would choose 2 over 1. Again, choosing Ultima Underworld II over the original seems just as weird of a choice, since also many people liked the original more than the sequel. I don't agree with their choices on other games that are a part of a known series: EoB, Dungeon Master, Wizardry series, Ultima series - I honestly can't figure out why would you recommend playing Eye of the Beholder 2 or Baldur's Gate 2 and not recommend playing Eye of the Beholder or Baldur's Gate - those game are great.  But since they made I choice, I will argue there are multiple classic and very good rpg's missing from this list, and I will also focus on overall series of games, and not just single parts, as the best representative of a whole.  Here are some games I would argue are seriously lacking from this list:  Anvil of Dawn being one of the best classic style dungen crawler RPG's and is seriously missing from this list. Dungeon Hack - one of the first randomly generated dungeon crawlers with first person point of view - you could say that it was a roguelike version od Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master. Eye of the Beholder 1 and 3 - why only 2 is on the list? I believe 1 is great, and 3 is not worse than 2. If they wanted a shorter list - why not put it as a trilogy or a series - this way, everybody can agree, that this particular entry has a place in this. The fantastic Menzoberranzan game - seriously, this game is a gem, fantastic story and very good graphics. Ravenloft: Strahd's Possesion - another well known game, in a very seldom visited AD&D setting. Stone Prophet - I guess their lesser known cousin is missing for a reason, but the list includes some very random and lesser known games, so why not this one? It's as good as Ravenloft and Menzoberranzan. The Ishar Trilogy by Silmarils - a very good series of games, and well known I might add. Realms of Arkania trilogy - also a great series of games, with part 3 being quite modern and well designed. Albion would be also an interesting add-on on the count of it's original setting. Might & Magic series - these went for a long time, and my friend was a very big fan of those games. I will take his recommendation as a good reason to have this series here, since I recpect his knowledge and fandom of rpg's. Seadogs series would also fit this list, since they have more rpg elements than some of the choices made by the creators of the list. Why Risen and not the very good Gothic series of games? I will never know. Dark Sun 1 and 2 - I would argue that these games deserve to be on this list, the story is interesting, the setting of Dark Sun universe is very unique and the games are enjoyable, with multiple side quests, many with different ways of completion, and in the early 90s no less. Demise: Rise of the Ku'tan - a very deep, complex, and rich dungeon crawler which takes into account many things we never do, like aging, class restrictions and class skills - which require a lot of planning and customization, passage of time while traveling and much more - a very good rpg game. Lands of Lore series - why not mention this fantastic series of games ? Very rich and original story, I would seriously recommend this to any new rpg player. Eschalon: Book series. When mentioning multiple indie, kickstarted games, why not mention the one that brought modern RPG's back to the basics? Divinity series - seriously, the Divine Divinity game is excellent, with multiple side quests, hidden secrets and much more than the basic story, which is also interesting offers.  I already mentioned Icewind Dale, Diablo, Neverwinter Nights and there are also other multiple entries of the series which are missing. Strangely. Since this is a PC series, I am not going to include emmulator enabled games from the NES, SNES, PS1, PS2 etc, but  mentioning FFVII, Grandia, Breath of Fire, Knights of Xentar, and many, many other JRPG style games seems mandatory, and the randomness of their representative on the actual list is very questionable. This is an off the memory list, so I'm probably missing multiple games I used to play, but not remembering them right now, but those I mentions I have played and would recommend as very good entries in the rpg series.  Not mentioning MMORPG's also seems weird, but let's just leave it at that - those are their own category, I agree, but I would also move Rogue-likes to another sepparate directory, and I would also make an distinction between action rpg and classic rpg since many of them are vastly different from each other.     [EDIT]: OOH! OOH! I would like to add games, which are currently on my desk, within my reach, and which I missed: Septerra Core, Summoner Silverfall and Silver - all good rpgs."
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,errboi,4,Sat Jul 11 09:55:32 2015 UTC,You'd probably like RPG Codex's Top 70 PC RPGs much better.
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,planetwords,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:56:46 2015 UTC,"I did like it much better, still missing some very good games, but has a bunch of even more classic games, even games that I never played, because I was a bit late to the PC market."
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,Makonar,2,Sat Jul 11 22:28:13 2015 UTC,"Well for the BG2 but not BG1 thing, many people considered BG2 to be vastly superior due to the engine update it received. If you never played BGTutu or BG:EE I can kinda understand why you might leave BG1 off the list."
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,errboi,2,Sat Jul 11 10:54:04 2015 UTC,"I personally liked BG1 very much. I had no problems with the graphics engine - the sceneries were very nicely done, there was a lot of detail and I liked the realism of characters. I never had complaints. It should be noted that when released BG1 received almost nothing but praise, most magazines would give it either 9 or 10 out of 10, so there was not a huge backlash against it. BG2 was probably praised for expanding or improving on the original BG1 but some would also argue that the game is nothing more than a glorified expansion pack, and does not have a distinc advantage over BG1. I personally liked the sprites of BG1 better  than the clunky pseudo 3D models of BG2, but it only my personal opinion. Also, it should be noted - without the enormous success of BG1 - BG2 would neve have happened."
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,storander,5,Sat Jul 11 12:15:47 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved BG1. I first had a demo disc, and I played to the end of the Nashkel Mines 20 times before I convinced my parents to actually buy me the full game, but try to go back and play BG1 without EE or any mods. The game engine was pretty noticeably overhauled between games. Aside from major quality of life improvements (like increasing item stacking limits, and increasing movement speed so it doesn't take 10 minutes just to walk from one side of Candlekeep to the other), they also reworked significant things like the class system (adding base classes like sorcerer and barbarian as well as introducing kits), and the weapon proficiency system. In BG1 you picked broad weapon categories like ""blunt"" or ""large swords"" or ""small swords"" which gave you proficiency in a number of different weapons with just one pip, while BG2 split up all the weapons, forcing you to choose individual weapon types, as well as introducing the various weapon styles.  BG2 has so many distinct advantages over BG1. You are right though that the success of BG1 laid the groundwork for BG2, but in terms of gameplay mechanics, BG2 is a huge resounding improvement over BG1. I don't think very many people would seriously argue that BG2 is just a glorified expansion pack."
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,Lashbel,2,Sat Jul 11 13:13:12 2015 UTC,"I tried to get into BG with the event of the BG:EE remake but never quite got it. I played BG2 when it originally came out and still think it's my top RPG game.   I much preferred the 'epic' feel of BG2, instead of starting off at level 1 and having small rodents able to kill you."
rpg_gamers,3cve9x,Matrix117,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"Personally I have played BG1 original quite recently, since I am mostly replaying my classic games from my childhood theese days, and I can tell you that I never focused on the limited classes, skills, level cap etc - I always had so much fun, even just by uncovering all of the maps, finding npc on different maps, hearing to my companions talk to each other and focusing on the great story. The first time I fought the huge ogre, met Drizzt and Elminster, discovered secret stash on my own, made a dash for my favourite companions, and made boo squeak over and over again... man, it makes me want to play this game again. As for BG2, I never really liked the start in the dungeon... it takes a lot of time to get to ""gaming"" and I dislike this part with a passion. The rest of the game - fantastic, but being forced through a long and boring dungeon... not that great."

rpg_gamers,3cve9x,Roike,6,Sat Jul 11 04:44:32 2015 UTC,"Also Witcher 1 and 2 should even be on the list. The same goes for Fallout 2 and games like Icewind dale, the first Neverwinter nights, Diablo, FFVII etc. This list contains some relative unknowns but ommits classic and very well regarded games, also one of the very best games are at the end, while some very questionable titles are at the top. I'm sure it was one person's personal view and not a collective decision."

rpg_gamers,3cud6q,iZealot86,2,Fri Jul 10 22:57:19 2015 UTC,"Diablo 3 has more of an ""arcade"" feel to it, where you can jump in and mow down hordes of mobs in a flourish of pretty spells and shiny loot. It has translated well to a couch co-op game on consoles.  Path of Exile is grittier and rewards players who take extra time to plan builds and make sure every stat is perfect. RPGs are generally defined by leveling and gearing up, and in this respect PoE has much more to offer IMO."
rpg_gamers,3cud6q,Signal09,2,Fri Jul 10 23:02:44 2015 UTC,"I feel this game is more hardcore.  You really have to put in way more effort, playtime, and planning/trading to succeed.  Diablo 3, while fun in a different way, is definitely more casual.  Out of the two, however, I prefer D3 because I don't have the time to invest in something like PoE."

rpg_gamers,3cud6q,Alakk-Naar,3,Sat Jul 11 01:10:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think a +/- comparison tool wouldn't capture the gravity of switching up gear in PoE. There are just too many moving pieces for something to be boiled down like that."

The story is great in my opinion. You can have a party of up to 6 characters (main plus 5 npc) that join along the way, each with their own backstory. Many more than 5 to choose from. Some of the characters are very well designed and memorable.  What I really love about the game though is the exploration. You can stick to the story or just take your chances exploring every nook and cranny in new areas often finding cool magic items,  monsters, and side quests. One of my favorite games of all time. Also a lot of replayability with all the different classes you can play. There is a multiplayer too but I steer clear of it as it's pretty unstable even today."

I know that Beamdog has said in the past that they dont think achievements would jive well with this game, I disagree.  I'd still love to see them..."

rpg_gamers,3crznw,errboi,-7,Fri Jul 10 15:35:53 2015 UTC,It's the flashy effects that look like Diablo. What engine or UI it uses doesn't mean anything when the diablo-esque pixel explosions make me want to throw up.

rpg_gamers,3crwg6,Alkibiades415,10,Fri Jul 10 20:43:58 2015 UTC,"No doubt about it: Dragon's Dogma (which happens to be my favourite rpg in general, but the mage and sorcerer gameplay is outstanding)  Watch this video if you want to see all the spells (and I'm especially talking about the latter half of the video where you will see how to conjure things such as giant tornadoes, meteor storms and earthquakes.)  What makes the magic from this game different than from ''standard'' rpg-magic is that you don't just hold out your hand and a boring fireball flies out, but you can summon many different sort of spells, yes fireballs are included but you can go for giant ice spikes or shields of lightning. Maybe you want to summon a disease? No problem.   What's great about it is the feeling of build up. Basically, the stronger the spell is that you want to summon (the four biggest ones being the great meteorshower, great ice spikes, great thunderstorm and great earthquake), the longer your character will have to charge and summon them, as you can see in the video. This requires a very tactical sense to use magic effectively, because if you're hit while conjuring, you will have to start over again.  Anyway, check out some sorcerer gameplay video on youtube if you want to see more. But even if magic doesn't interest you, DD is my favourite RPG of all-time. It's very ''hardcore'', but very beautiful. It's the only 360 game I still play apart from Red Dead Redemption."

There is a Dragon's Dogma Online coming to Asia soon (and probably years and years later, if ever, to the West) which will probably also be for PC, but I'm not hearing many good stories about it."
rpg_gamers,3crwg6,Jinxtah,13,Fri Jul 10 08:42:51 2015 UTC,"That's a hard question to answer. I've played a few where it was a lot of fun playing as a wizard even if it wasn't perhaps the most powerful.  Gothic 2 comes to mind. Here being a wizard doesn't mean raining spells of doom upon your foe for most of the game. You have to think about spells more in a complimentary way to your melee style (at least if you're playing with the expansion which makes the game MUCH harder). It isn't until the end you become so powerful it's silly. It's very gratifying learning a new spell because you put so much effort into getting to that point (new level, getting the spell components to create a rune, putting the points into learning the spell).  Dragon Age Origins is another game that's really fun to be a wizard. The wizards in this game is by far the most powerful when made right (combining the right schools of magic).  Baldur's Gate 2 is more the traditional old school mage experience. There's really no other game like it when it comes to the mage experience.   Divinity Original Sin probably has the best combat of any RPG I've played. The mages in this game rule supreme, and you rely heavily on setting up the environment to your advantage. You also combine 2 schools of magic per mage, so it's very advantageous to have 2 mages in your total of 4 party members. The way they've made the spells rely on synergy is outstanding.  You have for example the earth and fire schools which has excellent synergy. You can lay down patches of oil and set them ablaze or make an area poisonous and blow it up with fire. You can also make sure your fighters or whomever are immune to the burning effect and just wreak havoc (the burning effect is devastating to enemies) on the battlefield.  Or you can have a water/air mage who can create puddles of water everywhere (focused or just have it rain altogether) and use electricity to shock and stun opponents. This combination has amazing crowd control abilities and no party is complete without one. There's also no healing class per se in the game. Instead the wizard water school includes healing spells, making them vital to any party.  I could go on and on about this game and how amazing the combat system is for mages, but I think you get the point. If you're thinking of giving it a try, I'd suggest waiting a little while yet. They're remaking the game into a sort of game of the year version which has tons of content added to it (free to current owners as well), so it might be better to wait instead of missing out on that experience.  I'm sure there are lots of other games where it's amazing being a mage, but those were the ones that sprung to mind."

You just want to play the game like any other game, but, suddenly, one of your friends kills you. Just like that. No warning. You never saw it coming. You knew that friend from long ago, from high school, he was there for you when you needed it the most, and you never imagined he had the guts to kill you from the back.  Then, The Gods give you a second chance. You kill him back. Because why the fuck that asshole deserves to live. After that, your other 2 friends start attacking you, because they are now a team, and decided you are a threat, along with your friend.   You have no other choice but to ally yourself with the bastard that killed you, and try to survive by killing everybody because you don't trust anybody.   After hours and hours of carnage, massacre and this, you do not longer have friends. You just have enemies.   After 2 years, I can't finish this game because we keep killing each other.   10/10 Great game."

In Fable you have several spells, and each one can be levelled. I really liked the diversity and the simplicity of this system. Also the fact that no spell gets obsolete - for example on higher levels your once basic lightning does more damage, skips between enemies and can even decapitate the weaker ones :)  In KoA magic is also very easy to use, and very effective. It's extremely responsive and fast. It also just feels right."

rpg_gamers,3crwg6,MysticExarch,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:55:36 2015 UTC,"Baldur's Gate 2. The wizard and sorcerer are both amazing and fun classes. The wizard is better for new players. It's weaker than the sorcerer but still very powerful. Sorcerer is the best class in the game and extremely powerful, but you have to know what you're doing.    In the beginning, you'll have average power. But about halfway through you'll start to unlock your potential and be a little OP. It's a lot of fun and there's some really cool shit you can do. You get a lot of versatile ways to approach combat, or even non-combat situations. Not like most rpg games where you just choose between fire, ice, or electricity.  By the end of it though, you'll be so ridiculously powerful. This is due to the fact that spellcasters are a bit OP in old school D&D. You'll be stopping time repeatedly and killing people before they can even move. Summoning armies of angels called planetars that are basically the most powerful non-gods in D&D.  You can easily start soloing the hardest difficulty when you get close to the end. The expansion pack, Throne of Bhaal, is solo-able in this fashion all the way through. You'll feel like a god, and that's how the mage should be."

Therefore, unless you switch to the mage early, you won't be able to cast high level spells. Even so, you won'y ever be able to achieve as high mage levels as a pure mage can. A pure mage/sorcerer will always have more time stops and such available.   Besides, why bother attacking with weapons when you can time stop + shapechange into a mind flayer and intelligence drain bosses to death in three hits?   The AC bonus is irrelevant when nothing can damage you because you're either A) immune to everything, or B) time is stopped, or C) you're hiding behind planetars and projected images, or D) all of the above?  Granted, kensai/mage is more fun if you don't want to break the game completely and want more of a challenge.

So squall dies, but is caught up in ultimacias time funnel and is constantly pulled to the timeline that eventually leads him to confronting ultimacia. So that's why when the end scene shows all this confusing stuff, you're seeing all the ""potential timeliness"" that involved squall. hence why there are so many scenes of rhinoa in space where it's least likely she could live and that timeline couldn't progress. I think at the end squall does find the ""best"" thing which is everyone being ok and him being with rhinoa."

He makes up his own interpretation of the ending cinematic and claims it's his dream ending, but it's just them leaving the time compression:   Laguna tells the party earlier that to exist in the time compression they have to believe in each other as friends and not to forget each other, this is hard for Squall since he is a introvert (which is explained since the beginning and throughout dialogue in the game) and the ending cinematic is him finally being able to open up to Rinoa and thus finish his character arch that started from the beginning of the game.   Instead the theory says screw the character development of the main character and sweeps it under the rug as a dream."
rpg_gamers,3cbh70,Warriorccc0,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:40:11 2015 UTC,"What is the ultimate power needed to defeat the Sorceress? The ability to allow an individual's consciousness to experience other timelines through a dream. That's established in disc 1. Let's assume that Ellone silently connected with Squall during that battle with the sorceress.  Squall mortally wounded, Ellone sends him back into himself before the moment of his death knowing that she's already connected with him and will sense the disturbance. That triggers a second recursive event where the conscious Ellone in that timeline uses her powers to render Squall unconscious, before he can be killed. So, he's captured. He remembers the wound because he was sent into himself from a timeline in which the wound occurred. The rest of the game then happens, in that imaginary false-timeline that exists only in a recursive dream. When the dream ends in the defeat of the Sorceress through recursive time travel leading to time compression, all of reality that was shaped by the existence of the sorceress ceases to be, popping like a bubble on the surface of a higher reality.  Question: How can Ellone possess a power that can be used to fold time without being able to use that power recursively?  It seems an infinite loop of recursion is exactly what you would need in order to do it. That's beyond the powers of the artificial Ellone Junction Machine, but not beyond Ellone herself. Because of the self-fulfilling nature of the timeline, Ellone exists up until the end of time which occurs the moment she inevitably triggers time compression. That allows her to recursively call her time-jump power infinitely upon itself from the end of time all the way back to the beginning. This results in time compression with all possible times, past present and future alike combined. After all, the recursive loop results in an outcome in which all points in time are folded in to the same place.  I would explain the result of destroying the sorceress through such an imaginary timeline as such: Time as a fourth dimension with an arrow pointing one way is destroyed once time compression occurs. The end of time becomes as valid a starting point as the beginning of time and a timeline exists where the sorceress participated in a chain of events resulting in time compression. Effect leads to cause, sufficiently validating the new reality. In this state, it's irrelevant that it came about through an imagined timeline because it managed to come about.  Final Fantasy 8 and it's entire world exists entirely in a time paradox that ultimately resolves itself through the eradication of the paradox before it existed."

Titan Quest Torchlight 2 Grim Dawn Path of Exile   I've only played the first 2 and am looking forward to Grim Dawn, but Titan Quest is rather special for me.  However, if you're willing to complicate things with party-play for a bit: Icewind Dale: EE is out now, and it's basically 'linear Baldur's Gate'. It's more like an ARPG as it's very combat-focused. Icewind Dale 2 (not an EE version) is available as well, but I've heard people having issues getting that working on modern systems."

In the meantime you could get hooked on Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas. I haven't played three in quite some time, but I've recently started New Vegas and it's aged as well as one might suspect but is by no means an ugly or terrible game.  It's pretty linear (main quest is go here do this, go there do that, step step step oh you're at the end yay!).

rpg_gamers,3bwyzg,AdmiralFrosty,3,Thu Jul 2 20:59:23 2015 UTC,I think you got farther than I ever did. I played it on the Atari 800 3 decades ago and I remember it being very hard - open the wrong door and your entire party gets wiped out. It took a lot of starting over before I could get a party strong enough to survive for very long. I never did see it through to the end.
rpg_gamers,3bwyzg,Zoraji,2,Thu Jul 2 22:42:19 2015 UTC,It took hours to get my party past their first level. You start in a city that can give you random encounters that can wipe even a party of veterans if you're not careful. You learn what you can fight and hope you can escape what you can't. And save after every fight. I think it took about five hours before I felt confident enough to enter the first dungeon. This map is from the second level of it.

Terraria has been a good co-op game for us and it seems like a good time to get back into that now with the recent content update.  Minecraft modpacks have also been pretty fun. She doesn't like 1st person either but 3rd person is alright so we have to mod her 3rd person camera so it doesn't suck.  I'd also recommend Don't Starve Together, Civ V, and Endless Legend.

rpg_gamers,3bmx83,IforgotwhatIwasdoing,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:26:39 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about this game, however the concept across most games is that lower rate = higher damage. Higher damage is greater in most games due to armor mechanics; dodge mechanics should balance it out with higher fire rate, but the combination almost never does and higher damage usually remains better."
rpg_gamers,3bmx83,Timerez,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:44:46 2015 UTC,"I haven't played in awhile but I think the damage is same with single shot, but then lose some power when firing rate is increased. (Like 400 damage for single, but then 190 for double shot... etc)   That's my best rough estimation since I haven't really played in awhile. lol"
rpg_gamers,3bmx83,lordbreezy,2,Tue Jul 7 16:02:50 2015 UTC,lower fire rate on your weapon = higher damage per shot

rpg_gamers,3bpzs3,Roike,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:23:12 2015 UTC,"It's a hardcore stealth game, so be prepared for that. The guards will kill you pretty easily if you are foolish enough to get detected, but that's part of the game's design as a pure stealth game. This isn't Dishonored or Deus Ex where you can choose to do stealth, cause chaos, or meet somewhere in the middle, It's purely a stealth game, not an action game at all. I would say it's more like the very early Thief games, where combat was an emergency last resort, and not reliable. However, if you are like me, and ghost through every stealth game anyway, then it's a great game. The level design is very unique, focusing on vertically designed levels. They took some elements of Assassin's Creed with the climbing, but unlike Assassin's Creed, this game is a competent stealth game."

Some of them have other dialogue options that branch off of those ones that aren't questions that advance the conversation.   The point isn't necessarily about advancing the conversation. Any idiot can write dialogue that just advances the conversation in as short and as simplistic way as possible, which what RPG's now do. ""Ok, go here, do this, all right, whatever."" Sure, it's an efficient way to get to the end goal, but it's really boring. The goal isn't really what matters. It's the detailed nuances along the way to end goal. In other words, it's about the journey and not the destination.   The other thing this meme demonstrates is that the story and lore is more complex and detailed. It's meant to demonstrate that you get more options overall.   By the way, PS :T has tons of different ways to advance conversations that are all more unique and detailed than the ones in the right picture.

rpg_gamers,3b3n2a,Hype_Man,4,Thu Jun 25 19:14:24 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, what is your favorite FF?  I find X to be one of the easiest of the FF games to just play and finish. Combat is quick, the story draws me in, sure it starts off rough, but halfway through I'm getting all the feels all over again. Kimahri earning the respect of his old tribe, the moment when Tidus realizes Yuna's fate, gah. Seriously some of the best character development of any game, period."

Then I lost the discs and never went back to finish it.   I don't care for Tidus as a character or the whole father/sin thing. I found Wakka to be extremely annoying.  I just didn't like the characters so I didn't really care what happened to them. I felt like Tidus having a breakdown after learning what happens to Yuna was silly and her fate was obvious yet he is the only one who didn't get it but now it's a huge plot point.  Stuff like that. IDK, I just didn't care about the story."

Also I was very unimpressed with the VTMB mod. Mostly it just changed some dialouge options, but I generally found that the old options were better written. I can see why they changed them. It doesn't really add much, just a few sidequests and more content to hotel hollowbrook (as if it wasn't long enough already.) I didn't finish it, does it change the endings at all?  Let me suggest for Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal the ascension mod. Makes it more difficult which is desperately needed. Plus the re-vamped boss fights are really cool."

rpg_gamers,3ar0eq,Axius,14,Mon Jun 22 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite games of all time. What I loved about this game was that you would experience the world from 3 different perspectives. For example, you would start by choosing one of the 3 characters, which means nothing (you will play as the 3 characters eventually, you're just picking the 'first' one). Then you would see the world from the eyes of that character, member of the Yellow people, possibly you would learn to hate the Green people because they killed your family.  When you finish the scenario, you may pick to play as character 2, who happen to be someone from the Green people, and for you, you are 'the good guys', and the Yellow people are trying to kill your king.  Then you play as character 3 who is neither Green nor Yellow, just a neutral merchant who deals with both. And then you alternate points of view, learning there really is no 'bad guys' and 'good guys', just different points of view. Loved that!"

rpg_gamers,3alsgz,Ravenborn,13,Sun Jun 21 13:54:54 2015 UTC,Looked like another generic RPG maker game but your map design is pretty good.  The aesthetic doesn't really lend itself to the atmosphere if you are aiming for horror. I'd suggest using your own custom art if you want your game to be taken more seriously. .
rpg_gamers,3alsgz,Magus80,2,Sun Jun 21 15:45:03 2015 UTC,I would totally play this. Which video games inspired you the most?
rpg_gamers,3alsgz,Bulkanic,2,Sun Jun 21 23:08:16 2015 UTC,I could see myself playing it just for the music.  That was great.
rpg_gamers,3alsgz,yParticle,5,Sun Jun 21 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"Looks promising. I'd definitely try to darken the atmosphere a little to get a  scarier mood like with lighting and darker colors.   Also, I'm not sure what type of horror you're going for, but for a game with this style I think a psychological horror would be cool. Really mess with the players head."
rpg_gamers,3alsgz,fgrgfrtgt,2,Sun Jun 21 17:05:25 2015 UTC,"It looks cute, which from your description may not be the best feedback! It's a little bright and cheerful for nearly all of it. The only time things started to resemble horror was when it got to the blood-smeared stone floors.  I think you need to tone down your pallet and get some Japanese horror 'flavour' sprinkled on everything.  Technically though, it looks like a fun little game. The art is clearly well made, it just looks well made for an entirely different kind of game.  Unless of course this is all just placeholder art, in which case disregard what I've said and maybe don't show it until it at least looks like how you're pitching it!"
rpg_gamers,3alsgz,ssatva,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:07:17 2015 UTC,"This is a great start, and interesting enough that I think you should continue, no question..  I'm guessing that you're using the RPG Maker assets as place-holders, and intend to get your own art made at some point? If not, I think the writing and feel of what you're doing may be worth it, depending on where it goes from here.  And you made some great choices with the RPG maker music, so the aesthetics show you have a nice sense of atmosphere.  Hope to see more of this!"

Ragnarok is a well known game for mvping and woe (monster vs player, highest dps gets a special drop and the rest drops on the floor) (war of emperium, a weekly guild competition where you infiltrate the castle and take out the crystal to capture the castle its not that hard to defend it!) i found the leveling process quite interesting (it might not be as fun at lower levels if you dont know how to level, be sure to visit the warpportal forums for questions if you're lost)  trickster is similar to ragnarok but it doesn't have any weekly castlesiege, it does have some boss killing and party quests though, unlike ragnarok which has human characters you start off with four different archtypes power - melee: Bunny (1v1) Buffalo (1vAll) / magic - caster: Sheep (choose 2 out of the 5 elementsfire,water,electricity,ground,air) Dragon (light or dark) charm - defensive/evasive: Cat (transforms into a beast) Raccoon (tosses cards) sense - Luck: Lion (uses gun but gun damage only scales of ac (accuracy 1 point of accuracy is 20 damage) Fox (is like a ninja, throws kunais or other sharp objects, they also toss mines.) it has many quests to complete and unlike most of games you can drill on the ground for quest items / exp.  www.playragnarok.com www.playtrickster.com   these are some old diablo style graphic mmorpgs, feel free to youtube videos to see how the games look like. red stone online, dark eden, mu online  http://muonline.webzen.com/ http://www.gamengame.com/games/online-game-media.asp?online-game-no=110 www.dklegend.com/  im currently looking forward to albion, das tal, shards online, lineage eternal, lost ark, tree of savior  im quite positive that they're going to make us wait 5-8 years for lineage eternal and lost ark."

The game is seen from an 'isometric' camera angle, although the game is in 3d. There are no companions."

rpg_gamers,3acr2n,frogfinderfred,4,Fri Jun 19 17:34:54 2015 UTC,"The Ultima series is widely considered to be one of the greatest RPG series in history. I would steer you toward Ultima VII: The Black Gate and Serpent Isle. GOG has them for pretty cheap, if you don't mind older games you should definitely check out the other games in the series - notably Ultima IV, Ultima VI, and Ultima Online.    I should add that you have companions in the Ultima series but Ultima VII basically automates them and the combat is kind of cheese anyway. You don't have to give them commands of any sort, you won't be hobbling yourself by not using them. You might want to give them gear, that's about it really.    Ultima VIII does away with companions altogether, but it is a huge departure in gameplay and style from the rest of the series. The world it is set in is pretty cool, and it is still a fun game, but it isn't nearly as good as Ultima VII"
rpg_gamers,3acr2n,Llamaling,2,Fri Jun 19 02:07:39 2015 UTC,"Ultima is a awesome RPG, and i've checked lord british new game ""shroud of avatar"" too, but Ultima falls in the category of companion RPG and I really wanted to play something different this time."

Just use the taverns to build an entire party to your likening. Baldur's Gate had ways of doing this also. Icewind Dale already has that feature from the start.  If you want to go back far enough to stuff like Fallout 1, 2 and Arcanum I think they are more doable as a single character than most, or certainly only have 1 or 2 companions at the same time.  Otherwise, I think you're delving into more ARPG fare with Diablo, Titan Quest and the like."

rpg_gamers,3ac8mp,xtagtv,2,Fri Jun 19 10:11:20 2015 UTC,I'll 2nd this.  The controls are probably the most non intuitive ever to exist in a CRPG- but once you figure them out they really aren't that bad.  I had a similar opinion of the fighting style in the original Witcher
rpg_gamers,3ac8mp,rhiyo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:47:58 2015 UTC,The first game has some really awkward controls. The second game is better. This is how I set up the first game:  Wasd- Movement  Shift - Action button (Turns movement keys into attacking. Shift-W to talk to a npc or pick up an item.)  Arrow keys - Camera (mouse control is really meh in G1)  There might have been some other controls but these were the important ones.

If you like tactical, I would highly recommend Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions (If you're not already aware, the FF titles are for the most part not related to each other in regards to story).  If you're in the mood for something more classic, I'd also recommend my favorites from the 16-bit era.

Unfortunately it's a lot better than most jrpgs, so it might ruin the rest of the genre for you.  It's called The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, and it's fucking amazing. It takes place in a huge, immensely believable world where every NPC has their own ne and personality and story that plays out as you go on adventures. Every time you complete a new quest the NPCs will have something new to say, and it's all interesting and well-written. The combat is more tactical than other JRPGs, and the story will hook you from beginning to end. It's a great introduction to the more character-driven aspects of JRPGs, but it has enough western elements to ease you in."

I'd say that P4G is great for people acclimated to the genre, but not something I'd start with.  There's very little actual gameplay for the first 4 hours or so as most of that time is spent listening to text and watching a few cutscenes.  You do very little during that time.    Nier on the other hand is a damned classic, in my opinion.  You need to play through at least twice though for the additional cutscenes and story."

rpg_gamers,3a6bhb,HearshotAtomDisaster,4,Wed Jun 17 19:41:05 2015 UTC,"Grandia was the first rpg I played where when I reached roughly the three quarters mark, I thought about how the characters (mostly Justin) had grown so much.  Also, what a great combat system. I always felt FFX tried to emulate it with how you could cancel enemies attacks if you timed it right, but wasn't half as intricate."
rpg_gamers,3a6bhb,HearshotAtomDisaster,3,Wed Jun 17 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I could definitely see Grandia being an inspiration for parts of FFX."
rpg_gamers,3a6bhb,marktronic,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:22:26 2015 UTC,I'm just waiting for someone who only passively played either or both games to lose their shit at my comment. It's literally just a single aspect of the combat I'm talking about- but a very important one.
rpg_gamers,3a6bhb,HearshotAtomDisaster,2,Wed Jun 17 20:38:26 2015 UTC,Child of Light's battle system has a similar cancel mechanic. It's a short and beautiful game; I'd recommend it!
rpg_gamers,3a6bhb,marktronic,2,Wed Jun 17 20:38:06 2015 UTC,I was wondering why I had never heard of CoL before. I kinda realize now why. Had it got a steam release I would of caught it (the only console I have really is an old 360 that I rarely used). Might have to load up xbl and give this game a go. Good looking out.
rpg_gamers,3a6bhb,HearshotAtomDisaster,3,Wed Jun 17 20:49:19 2015 UTC,Great news! It's on Steam and it's 40% right now!  http://store.steampowered.com/app/256290/

rpg_gamers,3a6bhb,DoobieDoctor5000,2,Wed Jun 17 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"With friends we call that the ADVENTURE! factor. Grandia and other jrpgs from the psx era had it in spades. Another series full of ADVENTURE! is the Lunar series and Star Ocean 1 and 2, and to a lesser degree the Suikoden series (once you get the castles the feeling kind of goes away)."
rpg_gamers,3a6bhb,ShibbyDota,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Lunar definitely had it. I wonder if that's what I recognized in the tone of the games.

rpg_gamers,3a53ib,ronniecross,12,Wed Jun 17 08:14:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a tough one.  I've spent time on both. From what I'm reading, my gut tells me to recommend Pillars of Eternity over Divinity: Original Sin. I find the latter to be more difficult (although that is up to debate depending on whom you ask), and there's no handholding at all - it is easier to get lost and frustrated than in Pillars. Plus, an enhanced edition for D:OS is about to be released in a few months. D:OS, while unquestionably a great game and a great RPG, had a lot of room for improvement IMHO, so the Enhanced Edition might be worth the wait.  Pillars of Eternity resembles very closely the original Infinity Engine games such as Baldur's Gate, whom Dragon Age Origins also took after (although in a much more streamlined kind of way), so I feel that's the one you'll probably be more comfortable with.  Again, both are great choices regardless.  EDIT: I'll quickly add that I found the story in Divinity to be pretty lackluster, and story is important IMO in a RPG. The game is laden with sort of tongue-in-cheek humoristic references which personally did nothing for me. I would even go as far as saying that it was something of a turn-off. But that is also a matter of personal preference."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,xyviel,3,Wed Jun 17 09:39:32 2015 UTC,"I would agree with this review. Pillars has offered a lot more that I am drawn to in any game. Typically I am a completionist that ends up not finishing a lot of games because of time, but I kept going back to Pillars day after day!"
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,raesputin,2,Wed Jun 17 14:10:43 2015 UTC,"Now you come to mention it, I vaguely recall hearing something about a new version of D:OS that's apparently 'very different', so it may be worth waiting for that to see if that room for improvement has been catered for. Thanks for the helpful advice!"
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,The_Raiff,2,Wed Jun 17 09:43:23 2015 UTC,"Just to further add to.... The enhanced D:OS that is coming out will add a lot of voice over (not sure if fully voiced), a reworked story and expanded upon game play. If you haven't it played it before I would wait for the new version as it will make your experience much more enjoyable (I stopped playing the game at around 40 hours as I was having problems with bugs and then couldn't get back into the story).  Pillars has just had an expansion announced so if you're a fan of the genre it would be a good time to play through it in preparation.  My play through of pillars was on hard and lasted 84 hours (this is probably on the longer side as I did a lot of exploring and tracking back) but found the game a ton of fun and combat to be a decent challenge on the harder mobs/side quests."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,stupidreasons,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:21:02 2015 UTC,"This might be enough to get me to actually finish D:OS. I deleted my first party with a misunderstanding of the profile feature somewhere in the third act, near the end, then got almost back there on a new one and got bored, because the writing is bad and figuring out the combat isn't as much fun once you already know what you're going to do."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,xyviel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:33:02 2015 UTC,My pleasure.
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,asandriss,4,Wed Jun 17 09:45:41 2015 UTC,"With all you said, I think Pillars will suit you more. Has better story, real time combat (on your list there's not a single turn-based game) and gameplay will be closer to, say DA:O.  Eventually you should play both (and Fallout games, and classics you mention you missed, no reason not to go back), but if you have to choose, I'd recommend going with Pillars."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,Siltyn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:30:36 2015 UTC,"I've played a couple of turn based RPGs (Child of Light, Stick of Truth), though not many and I dunno, I like them but they feel very different to RPGs I'm more familliar with. That said, I wouldn't rule them out, but yeah I think action is more my preference.   Also, you're right I'm quite fond of retro games, particularly if I played them (I recently replayed Indiana Jones & The Fate of Atlantis) but I was a bit late to the party with RPGs. I do intend to play them though! :-)"
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,Beldarak,4,Thu Jun 18 08:29:40 2015 UTC,"I started playing RPGs with Dragon Age Origins, so I missed a lot of the games that people consider classics like Baulders Gate.   I'd certainly recommend you play all of those great RPGs, like Baldur's Gate, that you ""missed"" because you started with DA:O."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,emmanuelvr,4,Wed Jun 17 14:18:52 2015 UTC,"I'd say, if you're in for the story, the character, lore... definitely go to Pillars. If you're more interested by gameplay (and/or if you want to play with a friend), go for Divinity.  The two games are really great so either way you shouldn't be disappointed."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,xyviel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:54:18 2015 UTC,"This raises an interesting point. I'm very much all for story, nothing beats a great story to dig your teeth into, so that's a big factor for me. That said, if Divinity is multiplayer, that is a tempting feature as it allows me and my partner to play together.  ....but I think story wins the story vs. coop decision here lol"
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,emmanuelvr,3,Thu Jun 18 08:32:54 2015 UTC,I'll be an asshole and recommend Shadowrun Dragonfall (Director's cut) over both.  For what it's worth this comes from a fellow DA:O fan.
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,xyviel,2,Wed Jun 17 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"Never managed to finish Dragonfall due to a game-breaking bug at the end of the APEX fight. It's been widely reported in the forums, and yet the devs have yet to address it. It drives me bonkers.  It's a nice and short RPG nonetheless, but recommending it above D:OS or PoE? You're off your rocker. =D"
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,CharliezFrag,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:32:50 2015 UTC,"It's not the best at every single thing, but it's better than both as a whole when you consider every area. Writing-wise it's almost on par with PoE, but with better paced plot and more fleshed out characters (DOS doesn't even matter). Setting-wise it is goddamn shadowrun, neither of the other two compare, even if PoE's is good enough. Gameplay-wise it's probably technically weaker than both, but more accessible and easy to like than PoE, although DOS is king in this. Roleplaying and flavor, it has Divinity beat EASY, but slightly behind PoE.  Really the only place where it comes out undoubtly last is in content, but that's reflected in its price, and some times less is more.  Ultimately I just think as a whole it is a more well balanced game than either of the other two.  Sorry to hear about the bug."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,stupidreasons,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on accessibility and pacing - the latter being due that since it's a shorter game, which helps (this isn't criticism - longer is not necessarily better).  I'm not convinced with actual role-playing however. D:OS really shines in its role-playing, especially in co-op mode.  That being said, I would definitely recommend Shadowrun: Dragonfall as a must-play RPG, if only the developers would fix the goddamn APEX bug and let me (and a bunch of others) finish the campaign."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,Shiny_Tiger,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this. To me Dragonfall is not quite on PoE level, but I'd definitely put it ahead of D:OS. It's just as you said, the pacing of the game makes a huge difference. I finished D:OS in ~60 hours, but past midway point it felt like it was dragging too much. Yeah, the combat is more fleshed out but eventually you reach a point where all the fights are pretty much the same, a rinse & repeat thing. In Dragonfall while the combat is much more simple, the fact that is shorter and has far better writing ( IMO of course ) makes it a lot sweeter to play through."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,thelastcookie,2,Fri Jun 19 08:12:39 2015 UTC,"I think Pillars is damn good, but if I had to recommend one recent CRPG, it would be Dragonfall."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,eternalaeon,2,Wed Jun 17 15:34:13 2015 UTC,"This guy has a good point. I love customization and lots of choices when it comes to character creation, and Shadowrun has that. It has a cool mix of futuristic technology and magic in it. It's combat is just like xcom if you've played that."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,Ikinhaszkarmakplx2,2,Wed Jun 17 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see a Shadowrun recommendation. I honestly don't understand why there isn't more hype and talk about the game in general. I feel like I'm exactly the audience games who want to revive the old BG and Fallout nostalgia are aiming for. While I enjoy many modern RPGs, it's awesome to see more isometrics coming back.   The thing is that none of these games (Pillars, Wasteland, DOS) quite caught the magic of those old games for me... except Shadowrun. I found myself grinning like an idiot so many times during my first playthough. It has that 'good old days' feel while being a fresh and new world. I can't put my finger on why. My best guess is because the universe existed before the video game so the lore goes far deeper than what you see in game. I have no trouble imagining the universe being 'alive' outside of the game if that makes any sense.   The first game was very good, but Dragonfall was amazing. I don't think I've ever fallen for characters quite like that outside of Bioware's games. They have that certain spark that makes me really care about the characters and their stories.   So, I can't wait for Hong Kong and can't recommend Shadowrun enough. I really think they have something special.  EDIT:  I don't mean to say anything negative about the other games I mentioned. They are all great games... just not quite as great as Shadowrun IMO."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,fantasticsid,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:03:33 2015 UTC,"Shadowrun Dragonfall (Director's cut) over both.   I will see your assholishness and raise you another asshole by ragging on Shadowrun Dragonfall for character creation, dialogue choices, abilities, character builds, character interactions, amount of content, and general story Leagues below anything offered by DA:O or Pillars of Eternity.  I enjoyed Dragonfall for what it was but I never understand the mountains of praise it gets when the story, characters, and gameplay were all really...light I guess is the best word for it?  It's like choosing the breadsticks instead of the pizza, the breadsticks aren't bad but it is hard to imagine why everyone is so worked up over them with all of these pizzas lying around.  Edit: I actually have to admit my assessment is on base Dragonfall, not the Director's Cut. For all I know they actually gave Decker's abilities and have more than 12 or so mage spells in the Director's Cut which would make my case moot."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,mostlyjoe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"Shadowrun Dragonfall   Nope! Not an asshole, I appreciate the recommendation :-) It's -70% on steam right now, so I've bought it. I won't play it immediately, but it's now on the list :-)"
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,sirkerrald,5,Thu Jun 18 08:37:15 2015 UTC,"Pillars obviously. As much as I like DOS, Pillars is what tickles my Baldur's Gate itch, DOS does not.  And since the Baldur's Gate series are my all-time favorite RPG games, Pillars it is."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,ai1267,2,Wed Jun 17 13:44:02 2015 UTC,"IMO, Divinity has better combat, and the whole co-op thing.  Pillars has far better writing (although the last act feels rushed)."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,sirkerrald,2,Wed Jun 17 12:18:25 2015 UTC,Hard call. Both are pretty damn good. I like the classes more in Pillars though. Build options as a PC are so much fun.
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,boot20,2,Wed Jun 17 13:32:24 2015 UTC,Divinity's nature makes it an extremely long game with having to repeat a number of combats at times. It feels like it can drag in places. I recommend Pillars first and Divinity when the enhanced edition comes out.
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,emmanuelvr,2,Wed Jun 17 14:39:11 2015 UTC,"Phew, I thought it was just me. i finished the first area, and haven't managed to pick it up again, simply because I felt it went too slow. Which is sad, because I really liked it."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,LilSassy,2,Wed Jun 17 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"80 hours down... playing coop. It's been a slog, but fun. I probably would've dropped it were I playing single player =/  There's a real dearth of coop RPGs like that."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,osprey87,2,Wed Jun 17 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"You have similar tastes to me.  I enjoyed Divinity, but something about the pacing was off...I felt like it was too much combat and sometimes you had to slog through sections and kind of grind to get to the next piece.    I really enjoyed PoE, but the end boss fight was super frustrating.  The combat didn't really scale to that fight, so by the time you got there, you weren't really as prepared as you should have been and I had to redo the fight half a dozen times to actually beat the boss.  Beyond that the story was excellent and the world was amazing.  If you had a choice, I would pick up Shadowrun Returns with the Dragonfall (and most likely the Berlin) DLC.  The OG campaign is ok, but Dragonfall is by far the best story and they fixed almost all the wonky mechanics.    So, my choice would be SR:DF, PoE, then DOS"
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,stupidreasons,2,Wed Jun 17 15:23:39 2015 UTC,Dragonfall has come out as Standalone (Director's cut). I'd definitely recommend picking up that version.
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,covertc,2,Wed Jun 17 15:56:21 2015 UTC,"I'm going to throw out that if you want to play with someone else then go for D:OS but if you'd rather play solo then Pillars of Eternity. Either way, you should play both eventually because they're both really fun games."
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,Atomos128,3,Wed Jun 17 15:56:57 2015 UTC,Tough call but I'd say Divinity Original Sin. It's a more modern take on the classics. That and it's my favourite game from 2014.  Pillars of Eternity stays more faithful to games like Baldurs Gate and may be harder to get into. Without the nostalgia factor I don't believe it to be as good as Divinity.
rpg_gamers,3a53ib,Atomos128,2,Wed Jun 17 10:26:18 2015 UTC,"D:OS seems, to me, to be a game built around a really cool combat system with a very well done and somewhat novel, but certainly not revolutionary, character building system. The main plot is, imo, pretty dumb, but many of the quests, areas, and characters are interesting, and there really is a huge amount of freedom in how to proceed with completing objectives. It's worth playing for the combat alone, and there are definitely cool opportunities for creative thinking and roleplaying, but if you're the kind of gamer who puts RPGs on easy and cruises through to see the story unfold (no judgement at all if you are, DA and ME would both be good experienced this way), D:OS will be massively disappointing.   PoE has oldschool mechanics that work well and require a bit less reading than the D&D rules of Baldur's Gate. Many of the classes and races are an interesting development beyond the classic D&D model. Mechanically, it's different from DA, but by much less than D:OS, which as I've said really shines in its systems, which are a departure from CRPG tradition. Pillars has much better worldbuilding, character development, and plotting than D:OS, by an absolutely huge margin, however. If you liked DA for some combination of story and mechanics, go with Pillars first, but D:OS is worth playing at some point unless you care primarily about story, worldbuilding, and characterization.   I think D:OS has great systems, but of the recent CRPG revival games, I think it's the weakest or second weakest overall. I haven't finished Pillars, but currently, I'd say it's better than (the very good, definitely worth playing) Wasteland 2, largely because I think the mechanics are better while both have quite good writing, and comparable in overall quality to Shadowrun: Dragonfall, which is a more focused experience than Pillars, and with a very different setting, so ymmv in comparing them. To my thinking, these are the main products of the current CRPG rennaissance, and all are really excellent games, that do different things well. I don't list the first 'new Shadowrun' game because I feel like the campaign was kind of a proof of concept, and while I enjoyed it, it was kind of silly, and Dragonfall, which it made possible, was really great."

If you have a friend that can play D:OS I HIGHLY suggest picking it up immediately.  ANyone who owns normal version gets enhanced for free.

rpg_gamers,3a467k,dat_face,13,Sat Jun 20 23:14:08 2015 UTC,I think the current fanbase for Legend of Dragoon is just too small in comparison with Final Fantasy VII.  I think ports of it will have to suffice.
rpg_gamers,3a467k,azlionheart312,6,Wed Jun 17 02:51:51 2015 UTC,You are being downvoted but you are right. The game is awesome but while FF series hit mainstream with FF VII Legend of Dragoon is mainly loved and known by RPG lovers.

Not even close.  I'm not saying I don't like Legend of Dragoon because I think it's great, but I had never even heard of it until I came onto reddit.  Everyone has heard of FFVII.  There's just no comparison.  Edit: I just realized you might be being sarcastic.  My sarcasm-meter is borken."

Dq8 is probably one of my favorite games of all time, and it already looks pretty damn good, if it were remade for HD and all that I think it would be fucking amazing!! But at least we're getting dragon quest heroes, which looks really good...why didn't they show that at e3...or dissidia... Bravely second...   Well knowing square they're just gonna save it for like tgs or gamescon probably. Anything new they have will probably be at tgs I would assume."

You hear some people say that FF7 is overrated, but I think that's just the effect of the many years of praise that followed its release. If you break down the things that made it great, you can see that they put a lot of heart into the story and gameplay. To me it's more than just another FF title, as is 6 and 9, so they better not screw it up!!!"
rpg_gamers,39zojt,mysticrudnin,2,Tue Jun 16 03:40:00 2015 UTC,"Almost everyone I personally know (read that: not everyone in the world or everyone on the internet) that calls FF7 overrated or a crap game, are one of two types. First type, the person who's literally never played, only seen someone play or seen a video here or there. Second type, the person who didn't play the game that released in 1997 for PS1 until about 2005-2006 and couldn't ""get past the horrible graphics.""   Whatever, they don't deserve to be as hyped as we all are about this. I came to terms with them never remaking the game and convinced myself that because of today's game industry it would probably be better to leave my memories of this game untarnished by microtransactions, DLC, voiced characters, and cut content."
rpg_gamers,39zojt,DocJRoberts,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:36:48 2015 UTC,"it's absolutely overrated. i don't fall into either camp.  what about the group that came into ff7 from ff6? a lot of us were pretty vocal about the game being a step down, and how people were convinced by its amazing visuals, fmvs, and marketing campaign to play it  i've mellowed out quite a bit since then (i dislike ffvi a lot more, like ffvii a lot more) but either way neither of them can probably get into my top 10 jrpgs at this point.  my stereotype is easy: anybody claiming it's the best game ever made either played it first, or haven't played many games/jrpgs. that's probably not true. but i would say there's definitely going to be a tendency there"
rpg_gamers,39zojt,mysticrudnin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"I came from FF6 into 7 and while I love 6, 7 wasn't a step down to me. VII inspired awe and heartache and emotions that 6 just never gave me. 6 was a great time, as was 9, but 7 will forever be my favorite Final Fantasy. Everything X and on has sucked massive choconuts since (not counting the new MMO as I haven't played and consider it a different beast than a usual FF game since y'know... MMO)."
rpg_gamers,39zojt,xiaodown,-4,Tue Jun 16 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"To say 6 is better than 7 is asinine. There's always going to be the minority out there who refuse to acknowledge that 7 is the best in the FF series because they're basically anti conformists aka hipsters. The reason that 7 is being remade and not 6 is because they know it will sell unlike 6. If 6 was as good as 7, the numbers would reflect that claim. If you mention the name cloud strife to a casual gamer who doesn't play jrpgs, he/she will automatically know who it is. Mention Terra or Kefka and you'll get a blank stare response."

rpg_gamers,39zojt,Destrina,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"Arguing with you when you've made up your mind like that is futile.  You are being extraordinarily rude and close-minded.  But here I am anyway.   To say 6 is better than 7 is asinine.   People having opinions are wrong.   There's always going to be the minority out there who refuse to acknowledge that 7 is the best in the FF series because they're basically anti conformists aka hipsters.   I am not a hipster.  Nor does liking FF6 make one a hipster.  I don't like FF6 because I'm an ""anti-conformist"", whatever that's supposed to mean, as if conforming was the only acceptable behavior anyway.  I played 6 before there was such a thing as Playstation; I remember rumors of FF7 on the N64 before Squaresoft ditched Nintendo for the limitations of cartridge games.  I was active in AOL Final Fantasy groups who passed around the 350KB FAQ for FF3US back when AOL time was charge-per-hour.  I have purchased FF6 at least four separate times - once, when it came out; once later in college (and opened it with a star bit to replace the CR2032 battery in the SNES cart); one GBA copy to play with my DSLite; and once on the PS3 app store.  I genuinely just like FF6 better.  I like the setting and the characters both better.  The battle systems, I don't find to be significantly different.  I think that the limitations of the SNES forced a creativity in storytelling and soundtrack that's not been equaled by any others in the series.     The reason that 7 is being remade and not 6 is because they know it will sell unlike 6. If 6 was as good as 7, the numbers would reflect that claim.   FF6 has sold 4.3 million copies; it's not like it's a disappointment.  FF10 has sold 10 million copies, but keep in mind, the mid-90's were an era of rapid change in the gaming industry - as a whole, the audience was much larger in 1997 than 1994.  FF6 also came out near the end of the SNES lifecycle while FF7 was still early into the Playstation's extremely long and prolific lifecycle.  In addition, gaming press was a niche thing and basically the only people reviewing games in 1994 were the editors of Nintendo Power, whereas in 1997, PC Gaming had taken off (thanks to games like DOOM and Quake), and the Playstation had become an enormous hit.     If you mention the name cloud strife to a casual gamer who doesn't play jrpgs, he/she will automatically know who it is. Mention Terra or Kefka and you'll get a blank stare response.   I really refuse to believe that's true.  Your average bro-gamer, Call of Duty player won't have any idea who Cloud Strife is, any more than Terra or Kefka.    Honestly, I think you're living in a very specific bubble of time.  We all have one.  I'm 34; if I mention to my group of friends from College, they'll all know who the characters from both FF6 and FF7 (as well as FF8, 9, and X) are.  In fact, be glad it's not my friend, Matt, writing this - his first comment would be ""man, fuck that game, fuck Aeris, plot holes big enough for a semi truck"".    We all are a product of our upbringing and our early experiences.  As an example, if I ask someone who is 33-36 who Atreyu and Artax are, or who Skeksis and Mystics are, they'll know, but people younger than about 32 or older than about 37 will have no idea, because they didn't grow up wearing out VHS tapes of The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal.  In the same vein, I never played Pokemon, and I don't get all of the memes or the jokes.  I don't know what a Blastoise is, but I've seen a picture of a turtle with a cannon, so I assume it's that.  I don't know why everyone was upset when the Twitch Plays Pokemon released some pokemons.  I'm not even sure if Pokemons is the correct plural.  I also don't get Spongebob - I grew up with Duck Tales and Rescue Rangers.  But that's Ok - you can like FF7 and you can think it's the best Final Fantasy, or the best game ever.  I disagree, I think FF6 is one of the best video games ever made.  That's life, we're all different people.  You can't go around calling people asinine, and hipsters, implying that they're stupid, and belittling them for having different opinions than you, though.  For one, the sooner you learn that, the smoother your life will be.  For two, it's important to be able to put yourself in other people's lives; to understand that their experiences have shaped them differently than you.  Being able to put your experiences in a broader context is crucial, and TL;DR: it's on the test.  I hope you take time to read this, beginning to end."
rpg_gamers,39zojt,DocJRoberts,0,Tue Jun 16 20:47:17 2015 UTC,"I read it and appreciate it your pov. Not to be a grammar nazi but asinine isn't an adjective to describe someone, it's used to describe inanimate things such as claims and remarks but that's besides the point. Listen I love 6 as much as the next guy. But for ME it really is just another pre industrial age kinda time setting like the vast majority of jrpgs of its time. I was rather harsh on the hipster comment but I truly feel that people who dislike 7 only dislike it due to it's obvious popularity. To ME it, 7 is the standard to which jrpgs were held to as far as storytelling and character development and many other aspects. I stand by argument that gamers who aren't well versed in jrpgs know the name cloud strife. They know ff13 because it's the latest of the franchise excluding 14 because it's an MMO and they know 7 due to it's popularity. But hey I'm an open minded guy. If you like 6 great. And the ten million copies of ff7 count towards 2010 which if I'm not mistaken would only be the ps1 copy, the original pc release and possibly the PS network release. Ff6 had snes, ps1 as well as the gba. Ff7 port is coming to ios now and Android in the future at some point as well the release of the pc port on ps4. More numbers to reflect it's popularity by fans. Bad games don't sell and the better games do. Simple logic."

FFVIII has better/deeper mechanics.  FFIX, FFV, FFX, and FFIV are about the same level as FFVII.  For a lot of people FFVII was their first introduction into JRPGs, and so FFVII gets some extra nostalgia points.  It's a magnificent game.  It is not, however, the best JRPG ever.  Suikoden II and FFVI are better for sure, and I'm certain I'm forgetting a few JRPGs that are better as well."
rpg_gamers,39zojt,Destrina,2,Tue Jun 16 17:07:23 2015 UTC,"...I agree with most of what you said, except for FFVIII having better mechanics... Deeper, sure. Better? No. That game's mechanics sucked, I'm sorry."
rpg_gamers,39zojt,DocJRoberts,0,Tue Jun 16 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"Customization > Static Level-ups any day of the week.  Customizing GFs to have the exact blend of skills, attribute bonuses, junctions, and utilities to make a perfect character is far better than equipping a few materia.  Most people just didn't understand how it worked, or weren't willing to put in the effort to learn it.  The materia system could have been a lot better if your weapon and armor's offensive and defensive power was divorced from how many materia slots it had, or if there were actually competing choices in the end game."

rpg_gamers,39zojt,taxoplasma_gondii,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:22:33 2015 UTC,Point? You can like FF8's combat system more than 7's. I don't.
rpg_gamers,39zojt,Pvt_MJCaboose,0,Tue Jun 16 18:36:00 2015 UTC,The combat systems are the same: turn based and ATB driven.  I like the deep customization features of 8 and you don't.
rpg_gamers,39zojt,taxoplasma_gondii,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"FF8's card game was amazing. But, zomg, drawing magic can jump into the bin of things I never want to do again.  But then, I liked 9 better than 7 or 8, mostly because it was a throwback to old school FF6, my favorite."
rpg_gamers,39zojt,neogetz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:30:14 2015 UTC,For me it's still the best RPG (at least JRPG) of all time.
rpg_gamers,39zojt,cyborgmermaid,2,Tue Jun 16 07:53:13 2015 UTC,FF7 is a game that I somehow never got around to playing. Should I play one of the more faithful ports of the original first or wait for this?
rpg_gamers,39zojt,RadicalDreamer89,2,Tue Jun 16 12:19:13 2015 UTC,"It was the first FF I played and to me the best in the series. I'd say go ahead if people say it's a really good port that doesn't leave anything of the experience out, then decide on that basis. The story is incredible and very mature. It will be so fuckin-fantastic to have that with the new make up!! holy shit, I can't believe this is real."
rpg_gamers,39zojt,bass_n_treble,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:57:33 2015 UTC,for me it's the attention to the characters that really makes it compelling. the development of understanding Red as the game goes on from just a lab experiment that talks to a complex intelligent character with a history and culture. Cloud's learning that his memory is faulty and the story of sephiroph. the fact that every character has an established history and development that explains them joining the story and fighting together it's something that feels missing in most of the games since.
rpg_gamers,39zojt,DocJRoberts,21,Tue Jun 16 21:20:04 2015 UTC,Here's hoping they don't cut out everything that was fun about FFVII and turn it into another YA edge-fest like Advent Children
rpg_gamers,39zojt,cyborgmermaid,9,Tue Jun 16 02:46:43 2015 UTC,The angst was pretty annoying. . .but damned if the fight sequences weren't entertaining as all hell.  The fight in the Forest of the Ancients is awesome.
rpg_gamers,39zojt,shadalator,5,Tue Jun 16 04:40:58 2015 UTC,"To be fair, FF7 was filled with angst.  You were younger then too so it didn't bother you."

rpg_gamers,39zojt,mysticrudnin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:24:27 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that. If you are telling the truth, you are the only person I have ever met in the twelve years FFXI has been out who has played XI for more than just a few days or a week and did not fall in love with it. So in that case, enjoy being incredibly alone in your opinion."
rpg_gamers,39zojt,koncept61,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:09:35 2015 UTC,"OK buddy. I played it when it was brand new and there was a LOT of internal hate for the game. People bemoaned the lack of soloability, the long party wait times, the xenophobia, Monks being useless before a certain high level, etc. I played with IRL friends who all wanted to like it like I did because we loved FF. I've made friends since then that played on different servers who had bad memories. Maybe you played later when all the people who disliked it left, but I am hardly alone in my opinion. I know 6 other people IRL who played and disliked 11.    So you're plainly wrong."
rpg_gamers,39zojt,insomniabob,2,Tue Jun 16 23:19:21 2015 UTC,I kinda hated XII and XIII could not get thru them. I started playing xIV and dropped it. With that said i have been really happy with XIV:ARR and with type-0.

rpg_gamers,39zojt,roxieh,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:36:54 2015 UTC,Same. It would be cool if the enemies were on the world map and you seamlessly go into battle in a turn based formation.omg that would be sick. I think since they're mainly making this game for fans and they know us fans will be buying theyll stay true to the original elements that made it great.

rpg_gamers,39zojt,G-0ff,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:44:45 2015 UTC,It's real. During the live press conference they introduced it and after they presented the clip you saw in this video you could see the people in attendance going nuts.
rpg_gamers,39zojt,mysticrudnin,-3,Tue Jun 16 22:19:47 2015 UTC,For the exact same amount of money they could have remade FFVI. Just think about what you've all done.

rpg_gamers,39zojt,bass_n_treble,2,Tue Jun 16 14:33:36 2015 UTC,Yeah my fault i have bought 7 3 times :(

rpg_gamers,39zojt,Lezzles,-2,Tue Jun 16 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"And yet, final fantasy VI is an objectively better game (even the series creator prefers it) with a more interesting world.

rpg_gamers,39zojt,iamthesky,0,Tue Jun 16 17:31:58 2015 UTC,I like 6 as well but to me it's just another generic jrpg like every other out there at the time. Wanting an HD remake of 6 is like wanting a remake of secret of mana. It's never gonna happen. 7 is a recognizable/household title to those who don't even play jrpgs. Even the new generation of gamers know 7. The demographic of fans who enjoyed 6 as their favorite are either too old now or don't care for gaming enough due to other aspects of their life. 7's demographics are typically people in their late 20s. Plus you factor in the setting which is more appealing to gamers of this new generation and you have another reason  why 7 is the only earlier ff game worth making a remake over. At the end of the day it's about $$$ and 7 will make se $$$...not 6
rpg_gamers,39zojt,koncept61,-4,Tue Jun 16 18:44:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting, except that by mentioning ""South Edge"" (unless it's a ret-conned new locale), it implies that it's a Final Fantasy VII sequel because that town popped up in Midgar's ruins."
rpg_gamers,39zojt,kung-fu_hippy,6,Tue Jun 16 03:24:35 2015 UTC,dude...it said remake at the end of the video...it's not a sequel. they're probably adding more areas like you mentioned.
rpg_gamers,39zojt,AltHypo,7,Tue Jun 16 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"The end of the video says ""remake"", so it's pretty unambiguous."

It's going to be a sequel, trust me."
rpg_gamers,3a255z,Meljum,3,Tue Jun 16 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"7 and 4 are the way to go. Avoid 8 for now, it's a big risk as more people tend to dislike it than like it. 3 is a DS game that's fun, but hit or miss. 14's an MMORPG, one of the better ones if you're into that sort of thing, but still not a good starting point.   I stopped caring for them after 9, so I have no opinion on 13, save for the fact that it takes a lot of control away from the player and puts you on rails, so to speak. That's in stark contrast to the series as a whole, and won't give a good idea of everything. It looks pretty, I guess.  There's no numerical order you need to worry about in FF games, except where it's a direct sequel (Final Fantasy X-2 or IV: The After Years, for example)  EDIT: I just realized they also have 11. I never played it much, but I do know it's an MMORPG that was out around the time of vanilla WoW."
rpg_gamers,3a255z,EraserParticles,3,Tue Jun 16 17:30:25 2015 UTC,"I would suggest not starting with 8, but I wouldn't avoid it per se. Wait until you are comfortable with Final Fantasy mechanics, then try it out, it has a great story and solid gameplay. It does have a slightly steeper learning curve though, so I agree not to use it as an opener to the series.   Otherwise, pick whatever interests you the most. All of them (except 13-3) are masterpieces. :)"
rpg_gamers,3a255z,Kopaka99559,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"I'd say solidly avoid 7 and wait a while for the remake.  With so many Final Fantasy games out there to play back through, there's no reason he couldn't wait a year or so and play through some other games then pick up 7 when it's shiny and HD."
rpg_gamers,3a255z,DarkAutumn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:00:02 2015 UTC,"But as far as the steam sale goes, 4 & 7 are probably the best choice to start. The remake is good if you have or are planning on getting a next gen system and are fine with paying $60+ for a game."

People do not like it but 8 is my favorite very deep/dark amazing story when you try to see REALLY HARD into it. 7 and 6 are probably the best. 4, 9, 5, 10 and tactics are very good games with amazing storys. 1-3 are good also. 13 story wise isn't as bad as people say but battle system is very different. I would say start with 7 or 6."
