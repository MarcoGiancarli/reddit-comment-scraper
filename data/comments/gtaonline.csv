I don't mind the invites, I get that some people enjoy things I don't and that for a lot of folks ""snipers vs stunters"" (or whatever) is where its at, I just don't want to get sucked into that crap...the result is that I rarely bother w DMs though I really enjoy a well made DM and I hardly race outside invites from crew...and my crew, god bless em, a lot of those guys dig stupid ass rampfest jumporama races so I've even gotta be careful there.  I haven't played other online games but its my understanding that it is common to have access to a list of lobbies available to join...wouldn't that be nice? I wanna have a proper race, I drill down to the options I like (contact on, catchup off), find a good track or a host I like playing with...of course, this is simple w a server centered architecture, probably a nightmare the way networking/matchmaking is in this game though."

gtaonline,3e1xtc,Kaleon,5,Tue Jul 21 18:55:53 2015 UTC,That's fairly standard. Players know that the leader had to pay up front and then get nothing in return until the end.
gtaonline,3e1xtc,PoisonedAl,4,Tue Jul 21 09:34:07 2015 UTC,What about those who just hold out until 25 then leave if they dont get it?
gtaonline,3e1xtc,GiantSquidd,8,Tue Jul 21 09:35:20 2015 UTC,"Let them leave. A 40/20/20/20 split often leaves the host with slightly less of an overall take than the other members (if they've played through all the setups and the finale).  Demanding more than 20% is pure greed, just let them walk."
gtaonline,3e1xtc,PoisonedAl,11,Tue Jul 21 09:48:23 2015 UTC,"They're dicks if they expect it from randoms. There are five setups that the leader doesn't get paid for, so a 25% all-round heist payoff means that the leader effectively gets paid much less than everyone else.  Most people don't even complain about the default 55/15. We understand that time is money. Players can flit about between missions as they please unless they're the leader, in which case they're locked in and forced to wait and wait and work and fail and repeat and wait some more and so on. The leader deserves the lion's share for their patience."
gtaonline,3e1xtc,GiantSquidd,6,Tue Jul 21 09:47:28 2015 UTC,"Anyone who asks for more than %20 is a noob that doesn't understand that the host has not been paid yet (and therefore, bound to make you fail) or a greedy twat (who will also be the first one to make you fail or quit the first time anyone else does)."

gtaonline,3e1xtc,Churba,5,Tue Jul 21 14:43:28 2015 UTC,"25% is way too much. It makes no sense for the Heist leader to make less over the course of the heist minus setup fees.  It seems the standard is 40-20-20-20. However, for the humane labs raid currently, that still places the leader behind the others.  The solution? I plan to give myself 45% and will get that 5% from the lowest level player or someone who didn't contribute to the setups at all and just was trying to ""snipe"" the finale."

gtaonline,3e1xtc,A_Zombie_Riot,2,Tue Jul 21 11:48:59 2015 UTC,15-20% is fair since in the end everyone walks away with about the same amount of cash. The heist leader gets a little extra at the 15% rate but they did take the risk of funding the heist. If I am playing with a friend who is dead broke I will tell them to lower my cut by 5% and take that for himself since I'm not hurting for cash.
gtaonline,3e1xtc,crocodial,2,Tue Jul 21 12:16:22 2015 UTC,"easily. As long as everyone else gets 15 too, I'm fine with 15%"

gtaonline,3e1xtc,MaleficWarrior117,2,Tue Jul 21 13:05:04 2015 UTC,"20% is more than fair. Here's why.  The 20% difference between the heist leader and me cover the cost for setting it up, and all the pay from the setups as well as getting paid for the finale. In the end, the 40%, 20%, 20%, 20% is actually way more even and balanced than the 55% 15, etc.  If you're being super generous, 25% is the way to go. But in the end, the heist leader essentially loses money on it.  Edit: Should clarify, with randoms 15% is really fair. With friends, or people who you trust (friends, essentially) 20% for them is really fair."
gtaonline,3e1xtc,Kitten_Hammer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:52 2015 UTC,"20% or i bounce.  a 40/20/20/20 split is the closest you can get to giving everyone an equal share from all setups + heist.    i am level 300+.  i know what i am doing.  i get unlucky from time to time, but otherwise, i do my job.  if you don't want to give me 20%, have fun going back to the lobby and sifting through the low levels that join and don't understand the basic concepts of the game.  i give 20%, i expect 20%.  now, 25%?  that is being generous."

gtaonline,3e1xtc,MatticusVP,2,Tue Jul 21 12:06:55 2015 UTC,"I am fine with 15%. If the leader decides to wait for up to three randoms to help him, he deserves a bit more then the participants.  If you give me 20%, I'm very happy, and if you give me 25%, I like you."

Trying being the key word because it is so infuriating how few people wanna do setup missions, and when you finally find people, the majority of them leave (some even leave DURING the mission).  So yeah, host really earns that 55% default they're given. Though if I ever manage to hold a crew throughout all setup missions and bring them to the finale (has not happened yet) I would gladly give them a bigger cut.  Last heist I did I went with default values and no one complained. When I did Prison Job last week (without even realising it was the double week thing) I gave everyone 25% cuts and not a single word of appreciation.  So all-in-all, 15% is just fine for PUGs, and I'd say only go higher if your crew has been with you throughout the whole heist and have been really nice."

Before starting he knocked me down to 0 thinking I wouldn't notice. Obviously I did notice, so i quit and found another setup, which this dude joined in, and he started complaining that no one ever stays in his heist lobby.."
gtaonline,3e1xtc,LordChiefy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:43:50 2015 UTC,Give 20% to those who have helped with setups and 15% for crew just joining for the finale.  The host gets any extra above 40% if he has had to go through the hassle of finding new people for every setup (it could add hours).
gtaonline,3e1xtc,TrollOfCentury,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:40 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the team.  I've got money, so it's more of a principal thing.  Give me a decent team that can complete a heist and 10-15% will do 20% is very fair.  Make me try ten times because people are doing stupid shit, then I want much more.    To be honest, if money is the only goal of the heist, and you're stuck doing it with random players that are doing stupid shit, I'd rather solo some missions.  The Kuruma makes a lot of missions that used to have some difficulty to them easy.  Just sit in the car and mow NPC's with the SMG.  If you're doing heists because you enjoy the gameplay, then the cut is much less of a concern.  The time I've spent in some heist lobby's while people argue about their cut I could have pulled of 1-2 missions myself and pocketed that difference.  Not to mention waiting for new players when someone throws a fit for ten minutes then leaves.  If money is the issue, stop wasting my time arguing about it and launch the damned heist so I can move on to the next thing that puts money in my pocket.  Ok, unintended rant over, yes, 20% is great."

gtaonline,3e1xtc,poho110,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"People are scum. Only good players will accept 15%, If they ask for more, most likely they are not very good players. This is my finding. I only give more money to people who have helped with setups. If they have done all setup missions and not failed badly, they get 20%. If they just join off the street, 15% should be adequate if that player believes it will be done first time and they will not die.  Here's where that logic kinda sucks though, and why everyone should accept 15%.  Pacific Standard Job:  Leader Setup Cost - $100,00.  Leader gets no money for setups. Crew that do setups get- $26,000 each per setup = $130,000 55% cut for leader = $660,000 right?  -$100,000 for setup cost. -$50,000 for refilling all ammo from setups, which you receive nothing for = $510,000.  Crew Members:- 15% cut = $187,000 + $130,000 for setup rewards =$317,000. Doesn't seem like a bad deal to me? Seems fair that the host get $200k more max.   If you're good at the heist, just start, do it first time, get free money and leave. Then take turns in hosting = Profit. Next time you host, be sure to explain this shit to people."
gtaonline,3e1xtc,SpartanKane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:51 2015 UTC,"Standard cut I always agree on is 40-20-20-20. It typically equals everyone getting a relatively equal cut of revenue from the heist.  That being said, it offers the heist boss little to no ROI on the money he put upfront."

gtaonline,3e1xtc,maurodsimone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:12:11 2015 UTC,I usually give 20% if the person has helped with some setups and 15% if they have only joined for finale. Seems fair to me.
gtaonline,3e1xtc,Curtis187,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:23:07 2015 UTC,"As host, I always take the easy job and make sure no one argues about anything in game or otherwise, I make sure I use the same people from start to finish no matter how good or bad; we are in it together is what I tell them. We were all noobs at some point and not matter how good you are there is always someone who is better. I give out 30% to all 3 players and keep 10% for myself, I usually break about even, but I am not in it for money, I like meeting new people and finding new and faster ways to complete the heist, no one complains and they do their job  when they know 30% is coming their way. 20% is not bad but its only fair to give 25% to everyone."
gtaonline,3e1xtc,shadow306k,0,Tue Jul 21 22:35:24 2015 UTC,"hostCut - setupCost = crewCut + numSetups * setupPayout   hostCut + 3 * crewCut = finalePayout    4 * crewCut + numSetups * setupPayout + setupCost = finalePayout   crewCut = (finalePayout - numSetups * setupPayout - setupCost) / 4     This usually works out to be between 15 and 20%, depending on the heist, the closer number determining fairest split. If someone was significantly more troublesome than others you can reduce his cut by 5%. That obviously applies when you have the same group doing whole heist. If I join a random finale I generally take the most difficult role and layout the plan, then ask kindly for(somewhat justified) 20%, but I'm fine if I get only 15.

Rinse and repeat. I know for a fact my connection is fine. I'm hardwired and never have a single issue on private servers.  What in the fuck is causing this strange connection behaviour 9 months after the launch.  When i first got the re-release, I was like yeah this is pretty expected. 9 fucking months later though? Is it just me or it feels like there's a lot of newbie developers who've worked on this game. As someone who does interaction design, works along side of many developers it actually wobbles my mind how fantastic a lot of aspects are of this game and just how fucking brain hurting a lot of it is too.

I can't remember the last time the server was full for longer than 10 minutes. particually if we have 30 player servers, why the fuck should anyone be shoved into one by themselves.

gtaonline,3e07ht,killit,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:27:36 2015 UTC,"No, you have it wrong.  The stupidest issues get fixed first, i.e. ""Fixed an issue where a player was able to wear a mask and a hat""  or ""Fixed an issue where a player was able to put crew color over chrome or matte finishes"".  They seem to actually focus on downgrading the game, rather than upgrading it.  How many ""features"" have they classified as ""glitches"" and patched (downgraded) now?  I have lost count.  In fact, they clearly don't give a fuck about what the players want.  I refer you to thousands of community topics requesting minor things like: firework launcher year round, ability to purchase Roosevelt again, aircraft carrier in freemode and/or creator, and literally every other thing you ever thought, ""hey wouldn't it be cool if this was in the game?"" has a highly upvoted topic which has been going ignored by rockstar for 2 years now.  They have NEVER ONCE granted a wish from the community.  So it's natural that the game-breaking, real issues have lowest priority.  And with all the above in mind, they might just be sitting back on their piles of cash, creating new bottlenecks in the code and downgrading the game purposefully, as a big middle finger to their customers.  In any case, they have already moved on to GTA 6.  They made their money, and GTA online is just ""good enough"" to them. They throw their lowest-paid programmers at it whenever there is a money glitch or an appearance glitch, because god forbid our players have enough money to afford to buy things they want, or configure their outfits in ways we consider weird.  No, they want nothing but vanilla players who all look the same, who struggle for cash daily under inordinate work to payout ratios, while prices for all the best items are sky-high, and who eventually lose interest in the game entirely and stop playing, because the game is constantly lagging them out and failing to connect anyways.

I clicked ready and was assigned the most difficult job (Pilot) which I didn't mind as I consider myself a great pilot.   All of a sudden, I saw my cut reduced to 10% and the job started. I had already made up my mind to fuck up the heist.   After picking up the ground team and Rachovski, I evaded the cops and started flying towards the dropoff. I then diverted and started doing stunts so they don't think I'm a noob when I crash the plane. I then got a text telling me to fly back to the dropoff then I proceeded to land on Sandy shores airfield.  I then took off, pulled a few more deadly stunts then crashed into a pool just to teach those bastards not to fuck with people. It wasn't a waste of my time as I had lots to waste, wasn't the money cos I had everything I needed plus enough cash.

gtaonline,3e1321,wolan1337,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:08 2015 UTC,"When playing as pilot you can maneuver behind the jet and just follow him He'll be unable to shoot at you and the demo can use his time to fly just outside of the prison killing guards But if he kills the jets the pilot has to keep evading the spawning ones, making it annoying and inefficient"

gtaonline,3e1321,wolan1337,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:26 2015 UTC,What I have found is that as long as you don't cross the road circling the prison you shouldn't get shot at while doing demo. I tend to stay a little extra behind it just in case though.
gtaonline,3e1321,dennisc3,3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:26 2015 UTC,"Even after the most recent update? I have done the Prison Break a few times lately with guys who are used to doing demo and flying support at the prison and they both got wiped out twice by a rocket that didn't give them time to evade, even though they were circling at a (normally) safe distance."

From what I saw last week, and from what my demo guy told me (I'm generally pilot or ground team), as long as we stayed across that road we were fine. When I was demo I tried to make sure I could see the road in front of me so I was a little further back. Not sure how the other guy was doing it."

It's unfair to cheat people and think it's a smart move.   I'm sure they must have been so mad when I nosedived into a pond because I was ready to take a 15% cut. The pilot job is the one many players avoid.

First, you joined the finale. You made that decision. Then, after getting the easiest role, you threw a hissy fit over 5% without knowing if the other 3 had played all the setups and were together or not. Maybe they were 3 randoms who had struggled to get all 4 setups done with other randoms and the leader felt they deserved a bonus for sticking it out?  But really, at the end of the day, these guys were making you an easy $100k (assuming it was 2x weekend) to fly a plane around a bit and you decided to return the favor by being a twat."
gtaonline,3e1321,justtroy,3,Tue Jul 21 13:41:51 2015 UTC,"They tried to trick him into taking less than he agreed to.  If they feel they deserve more than the normal cut, they should explain that to the person who's cut is being reduced. If that person doesn't agree, they can find someone else or go back to normal cuts."
gtaonline,3e1321,Born_Ruff,2,Tue Jul 21 14:31:24 2015 UTC,"They tried to trick him into taking less than he agreed to.   They did? All we know is he readied up at 15% and then it was later reduced to 10%. It's possible he simply readied up before the leader had a chance to allocate shares. Happens all of the time.  And I'm a big proponent of all 3 crew members getting the same cut and I'm a fan of sabotaging a heist if the leader truly dicks me, but I just don't think that's the case here and the only valuable lesson taught was that this player is an asshole."
gtaonline,3e1321,justtroy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:00:35 2015 UTC,"So you think I'm dumb not to know when I'm being cheated? He swiftly reduced my cut, upped his after everyone was ready and assumed maybe I didn't see the trick he pulled. I don't care about the final payout but trying to pull that shit deserves that kind of return. I never pay anyone below 10% except he or she insists.   I'm a fan of sabotaging a heist if the leader truly dicks me   Yet you go on to call me an asshole? The hypocrisy is strong with this one."

I clicked on ready as soon as I joined as I felt 15% was a decent payout for not doing any setup. As we were about to start, he then reduced my payout by 5% and issued it to himself. If you think I'm the twat here, then you're as bad as that greedy host."
gtaonline,3e1321,Un-trollable,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"If he dropped everyone down to 10% and gave himself 70% then yeah, he's a twat too. But if you then sabotaged the finale at the very end after the other 2 players spent time, ammo and vests to get that far then I don't see how you're teaching anyone a lesson.   If it was 60/15/15/10 it probably means those other 2 were on some setups and warranted a bigger cut. This isn't hard to figure out. If you don't like it, you could have always just committed suicide and left on the restart screen."

I've given 25x4 or 50x2 every heist I've ever led, which has been many. I've never asked for a bigger cut as a crewmember.

You can literally take a piss after the heist starts and still have plenty of time to get to the airport and fly to Sandy Shores. Then you fly around a bit easily evading jets and then land, wait for the ground crew, then take off again dodging the occasional chopper, then you parachute out and hop in the Buzzard. It's painfully easy.  Prisoner and to a lesser extent, Prison Officer, are much harder roles. Not only are you expending valuable ammo, but you're likely going to eat up 4-5 armor vests depending on how many restarts it takes. Those are $500 a pop. Literally everything about the ground team roles are harder than Pilot."
gtaonline,3e1321,justtroy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:33:59 2015 UTC,You can literally take a piss after the heist starts and still have plenty of time to get to the airport and fly to Sandy Shores.   It actually makes the heist easier for EVERYONE if you wait until around 3 minutes.
gtaonline,3e1321,DE4THWI5H,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:34 2015 UTC,"Well that's my own opinion as I've done every other role without much headache. If you're the pilot and your team keeps dying all the time, then you'll understand what I'm talking about.   Prisoner - Take cover and don't get shot. Support on occasion  Prison Officer - Shoot on sight and push forward. Exit prison with prison member and Rachovski, get in armoured car and get in velum. How hard could that be?  Demo - 2nd most difficult job as you need to protect ground team and Velum on escape from prison and runway.  Pilot - Keep flying to evade jets, dealing with random demo who keeps bowing up jets making life hard, perfectly timed landing in order for you not to get shot on ground while waiting and not getting Velum destroyed. Escaping 5* wanted level which could be bugged making you fly for several minutes.  This is why people don't wanna be pilot but everyone wants to be prison officer so they can shoot."
gtaonline,3e1321,Un-trollable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:25 2015 UTC,"Pilot - Keep flying to evade jets   If you know what you're doing, you can stand around twiddling your thumbs until 3m is left and then fly out of airport. Evading one jet at a time (piloted by a Stevie Wonder clone) is laughably easy.   perfectly timed landing   You can land the second ground team escapes from the prison or a minute after. I've never had a cop shoot at me in maybe 20 heists as pilot.   Escaping 5* wanted level   Very easy   which could be bugged   Only part of Pilot that is actually hard is getting glitched.  Meanwhile, if you're version of Prisoner is to just hide and not die, then Prison Officer is a rather difficult role. You're basically playing 1v40? with many of those guys starting in cover and the high ground and heavily armored. It's not exactly a walk in the park and you're likely use up a bunch of snacks/armor/ammo which you'll be paying for.  Whenever I'm pilot and the ground team dies quickly and fails 3-4 times in a row I usually just quit. Happens all the time. Kind of why I stopped doing this heist until the double weekend."

gtaonline,3e1321,DE4THWI5H,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:04 2015 UTC,Might be easy for you but I find it being the most difficult role as my thumbs get really sore after flying around due to prison team dying so many times. Everyone usually shies away from being the pilot for obvious reasons as there's no big deal in the remaining roles. I've done every role in the prison break finale and imo being pilot is frustrating especially once the 5* bug kicks in.
gtaonline,3e1321,Un-trollable,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:20 2015 UTC,"I need to see a video of the 5 star bug. I've done the prison break finale many times and have never seen it, I have heard it mentioned often however.  Also, your thumbs are getting sore? Wait until 3 minutes before taking off. This makes the heist easier for EVERYONE. Literally, everyone in the heist benefits from you doing this.  Next, fly behind the jet. Tell the demo to not shoot the jet down if you want, but fly behind the jet.  The ground team is the hardest role. 90% of mission failures that don't involve a demo trolling, are because the prison team has died. It's a fucking shitshow in there, facing off against an army of noose.  Demo is the most important role for several reasons. Firstly is that if pilot doesn't wait or fly behind the jet, he has to protect the pilot. If the pilot does fly behind the jet and waits, then the demo can provide air support to the prison crew. During the extraction the demo pilot has to keep EVERYONE alive and safe by blowing up as many cop cars and helicopters as possible. The ground team can't even make it to the plane if there are too many cops."
gtaonline,3e1321,DE4THWI5H,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:28 2015 UTC,I always takeoff at exactly 2:15 so I don't get to fly around all the time. We are talking about randoms here who keep dying time after time. Taking off and flying in circles repeatedly is tiring and people dying constantly only makes things worse.   I've done this finale with decent crews who are usually done right after passing the vinewood sign. I only get to see a jet which usually despawns right after. Maybe I'm just expecting too much from randoms but I understand that demo's got his hands full too.

What you're proposing is negotiating a higher amount at the start of the finale, on the promise that you'll reciprocate later on. This makes no sense to me because neither one of you are, in the end, getting any more money; if you both take 25% both times, that's no different than 20/30 now and 30/20 later. There's nothing else you can gain from that promise, so why make it?  In my mind, the only advantage it gives you is making more money now, then not reciprocating later, whether it's a ""haha fooled you"" thing or a ""oh my damn game is buggy and I can't start a heist because stupid rockstar servers, haha, right?"" thing.   Which isn't cut-throat, either; it's just being a dick."

I had some losers trying to give myself and another random 5-10% on humane labs yesterday while the host and his friend had 60% & 20% just because we didn't do the setups (they didn't seem to mind that the setups were paying out over 50k each).

Technically, sometimes the hosts gets a smidgeon more, and sometimes it's the players. A more precise 17%-18% would be even better, but I can see why Rockstar isn't going to add in tiny increments (we'd be in the lobby forever arguing over money and percentages).  And the difference in the end, even if you get slightly less from the default 15%, has to be in the $10,000-$30,000 range. That is not worth getting irate over. That isn't much money in the long run.  40/20/20/20 is great for players, and I won't complain when the host does that, but the Host gets paid less than the players (mathematically) and is taking a hit in the pockets for you guys."

Can't imagine trying to reason with someone who spends most of the day driving around blowing up peoples cars in freemode.   Get a dedicated team and cycle the heist leader, making 40,20,20,20 cuts and it evens out eventually."
gtaonline,3e1321,Smurfa,-4,Tue Jul 21 12:01:21 2015 UTC,"I can play with 15%, but if I haven't played any of the setups with the leader, then I'd say that 20% would be more fair since I haven't got any setup bonuses either. I understand that leaders can be hesitant since I'm just a random player, but if you join with level 100+ or 200+ then that player probably has played a fair amount and understand the game well and hopefully isn't joining to grief.  Also I encountered one leader this weekend which altered the payout to 45/20/20/15 when everyone had accepted 40/20/20/20, I was the one to get 15%. Needless to say, doing this is stupid. Left 10 minutes in the mission."

gtaonline,3e1321,Smurfa,-3,Tue Jul 21 10:31:42 2015 UTC,Why? Because I expect to be treated as the rest of the crew?
gtaonline,3e1321,comicsandpoppunk,2,Tue Jul 21 11:01:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I think he means because that you just showed up and didnt help with any of the setup."
gtaonline,3e1321,TrickyTrifecta,-6,Tue Jul 21 15:24:42 2015 UTC,"I tend to make a decision based on their player stats.  If it's a level 13, he's getting 5%"

gtaonline,3e1321,Smurfa,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:24:11 2015 UTC,anything less than 20% for helping in all of the setups isn't cool unless you clearly say what the cut will be beforehand or you are making deals if you are doing multiple heists with the same players. I am happy with 20% and never expect or ask for more and the players who were not in all the heists or were not in at least 80% of them shouldn't expect more than 15%.
gtaonline,3e1321,freekyeight,0,Tue Jul 21 06:39:49 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, but let's say you host and have a level 10 player being with you through the setups and suddenly in the heist you get a level 100+ player with you but whom haven't been in the setups, do expect that player to accept 15% when giving the level 10 player 20%?  Now, level doesn't have to say anything about how good the player is, but my experience so far is that I don't want to play setups/heists with people below at least level 30."
gtaonline,3e1321,Smurfa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:15:54 2015 UTC,"i would give the person who just joins the heist regardless of level the least amount of money opposed to the ones that been there through it all or most of it. the player who just joins the heist didn't do the work to get to the heist, they are getting a good payday by just joining the heist. I played with a level 4 one time and things went fine, as long as you have ppl who have a mic or can at least listen and follow instructions then level doesn't matter too much."
gtaonline,3e1321,freekyeight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:10:16 2015 UTC,It's understandable that you want to show gratitude to the ones that been with you all the way. But on the other hand you still need the last person. So just because this player was unfortunate and happened to join the final he/she should get less payout?
gtaonline,3e1321,Smurfa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:31:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, why should they expect anything different? I wouldn't give them less than 15% but they won't be getting anymore than that."
gtaonline,3e1321,freekyeight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:32:44 2015 UTC,And why would they expect to get treated differently? For all you know they may have happened to do 10 setups in a row and finally found a heist. Sure they'd probably be grateful then but you shouldn't complain if they don't accept.
gtaonline,3e1321,Un-trollable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"because they didn't help throughout the setups and how are you supposed to know how many they did on their own? i usually don't do heist finales with randoms anyways so i really have no reason to complain if they would accept it or not. People shouldn't expect to get 20% or more if they just got into the heist finale, you have to earn it and by just joining the finale doesn't qualify by earning it when other players have been helping with the rest of the setups."
gtaonline,3e1321,Smurfa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:46:34 2015 UTC,"I started playing on a second character and at level 15, I completed both the prison break (pilot) and pac standard (hacker) setups and finale without dying at all. I get what you mean but I've seen so many 100+ characters who are clueless. I usually view the player's stats bar not rank."

gtaonline,3e1321,Un-trollable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:02:50 2015 UTC,"Indeed, maxed out on both characters.  Have they fixed the glitch where people could just keep the trigger pushed with a chopper to max flying fast?"

gtaonline,3e1xvz,weejocktiny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:33:40 2015 UTC,i've noticed it depends on my mental state. if i have a red dot then two star cops will be highly accurate while continuing to shoot no matter what. for a white dot two star cops seem to miss on purpose or wait until i'm running directly at them to shoot me.
gtaonline,3e1xvz,sammydafish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's just me or what, but I have noticed that police seem to be influenced by global police usage. If I'm only with a few people in a session, if I hit a cop, I can be sure to have hell raining down on me almost instantly. However, on a full server where I can hear World War III going on down at the airport, the police almost seem to be too busy to really pursue or care (unless I up my mayhem). We've even done it while driving around with a goal in mind for our Gang; like half of the group focuses on our objective while the rest fuck with the police nearby but not in the same area. Almost always seems to remove the heat off of the goal team.   Though more with your original point, I feel like the cops have gotten a lot more accurate and deadly 3 stars and up. Like at 4 occasionally and at least half of the time at 5 you'll get sniped driving and die unless you're in a low profile vehicle or really booking it. Maybe it's just how it feels or something but honestly it does feel like they have been eating their Wheaties."

gtaonline,3e0202,RobCoxxy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"As RobCoxxy said, it isn't possible to have no weapons, so you just have to set the jerry can as the forced weapon and then unequip it with L1 before you wade in.

gtaonline,3e1nen,Unhandyfour,2,Tue Jul 21 07:08:12 2015 UTC,"If this is only for the getaway portion, then this may help you a lot. Once you have the bikes and have come out on the main road, take a left instead of a right like the GPS says. Since you're not supposed to go that way, there won't be as many cops until you make it to Sandy Shores."
gtaonline,3e1nen,TropicalShark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:39:31 2015 UTC,"Do you head for the highway, or use the GPS route given in the Convoy setup?"
gtaonline,3e1nen,vicebanger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:25:30 2015 UTC,Or the faithful karuma route
gtaonline,3e1nen,slrcpsbr,2,Tue Jul 21 13:15:00 2015 UTC,"Suggested route is the same road that you get the prison bus as demolition on prison break, then crossing the grass in a straight line till the railroad. Follow the railroad and by the end of the tunnel, right before the big bridge, there is a small opening where you can fall to the same dirt road that the dinghy is located."

gtaonline,3dxg5m,Lollistic_Biscuit,2,Mon Jul 20 11:49:56 2015 UTC,lol true
gtaonline,3dxg5m,ImFranny,21,Mon Jul 20 13:42:15 2015 UTC,"Since it's double cash and rp, I'll post a small tip for the finale.  Set it to player saved outfits. Ground team should wear an outfit with the heavy utility vest, so they can charge through without worrying too much about dying.  When they reach the cooling tunnels, ground team should open up the interaction menu -> inventory -> accessories -> scarves and put on any scarf they want.  Since scarves and heavy utility vests aren't compatible, the scarf will force the vest off, so now you can sprint and swim normally. This way you can swim through faster and finish the heist faster. You lose the damage resistance, but you won't be needing it at this stage.  Do note, that this will also take the night vision goggles off, so make sure you know where to go. Probably best to make sure you can see the door to the cooling tunnels first. You can also put the night vision googles back on if you want.  This works on any heist or setup, but is probably most useful on humane labs."
gtaonline,3dxg5m,peros2,5,Mon Jul 20 12:58:22 2015 UTC,that's smart.  Also I'd recommend using an assault shotgun if your aim isn't fantastic. Even if you don't kill them you can stun them and then finish them off on the ground with it.
gtaonline,3dxg5m,bearjuani,3,Mon Jul 20 13:41:19 2015 UTC,Or a heavy shotgun for those who haven't unlocked the assault shotgun.

gtaonline,3dxxxs,Dray_Gunn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:12 2015 UTC,I agree 100% with your second statement. The fact that armed pegasus vehicles are so expensive means that we arent swarmed by them in free roam and they only show up occasionally. It would be chaos if too many people had them.

gtaonline,3dzeg6,Caseyg75,3,Tue Jul 21 01:17:32 2015 UTC,"I've got so many good stories of great times with rather wonderful people online but one recent one really sticks out...  So I have a voice that is very often compared to the MoviePhone guy or Markiplier when I am just talking over mic. A lot of people seem to like the chatter and the silliness (guess it's a nice break from all the half-assed curses coming from the younger crowd or the confused yelling from someone speaking Russian) and through just chatting and being nice to folks I've met some great people. But one night...  I was chatting it up with a mate of mine and was tricking out the new Brawler just after the new update. He was drunk and I pretty faded, so we were being kinda morons. ""What color should I pick?"" ""I dunno...SHIT BROWN SON!"" Basically stuff like that. Well shortly after, we started complaining about the new update a bit. Then a young voice said: ""Doc! I wanna hear your full opinion! Rant about it!"" Being high and not hearing anyone else talk on the relatively full server, I was like, why the fuck not. So I whip out the hyperbole and go to town. Mate is rolling laughing. Someone else asks me to complain about EA. I go with it, just adjusting my now Piss colored Brawler and not trying to laugh. Then...""Hey Doc, where are you?"" ""Paleto Bay Mod Shop."" Silence. I finish modding out the car and leave the garage. I shit you not, fucking 16 people were faffing about outside and showing off cars and shit. I come out and loudly exclaim ""WHAT THE FUCK?"" Everyone is just like HI WHATS UP?   Next thing I know, we are all racing to an airport to hop in a Luxor, everyone chatting and bullshitting...no one killing at all. Fucking had to eventually get two of the things just to take everyone up to the top of Mount Chilliad where we all jumped out simultaneously. Then we all motored down south through Chumash to the Peir and I shit you not, got a full fucking rollercoaster going. Like everyone hanging out and just riding the thing over and over. Eventually people started checking out for the night...but man...I'll never forget having half a server hang out for just shits and giggles and not a modder in sight.

Was doing heists with randoms, and had a good 2 setups and we decided to keep going with the same team. During the last setup, I got my Insurgent out for a bit of fun on the drive, so that spawned in the free roam world afterwards.   Whilst waiting, I thought ""let's bash some cars around!!"" (I just got my insurgent, so still get giddy at the chance to have fun with it) So I get in the car, drive off just a bit, do a fancy 180 and drive back to the others. A poor dude (not player, just AI) is right in front of the rest of the heist team, and I'm like ""Yeah, let's show these dudes how badass I am"". I plow into the car, and get it flying. Weeehooo!!! BOOOM. ""the fuck?"" - I did not realize we spawned at a gas station, and I sent the car flying into the gas station. This consequently blew everybody, and their cars, up.

gtaonline,3dyfzv,87westy,3,Mon Jul 20 16:22:59 2015 UTC,This is what me and my group usually does. I'm always on the south lookout and shoot rpgs on the front to clean it up as quick as possible so the ground team doesn't get overwhelmed.

gtaonline,3dyfzv,MidClubGamer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:52 2015 UTC,"I don't remember what the lookout positions are named so I'll call them the ""front lookout"" closest to the main entrace with the fence and ""rear lookout"" that's closest to the East alley.  Front lookout and buyer take the front entrace, the bodyguard goes to the North alley to cover it and the rear lookout comes down from the catwalk and goes to that East alley to cover it.  Quick and easy."
gtaonline,3dyfzv,ILoveRegenHealth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The guy in the rear is much more useful if he just climbs down (or if he has high Strength Stats, fall down and roll w/ no damage), and cover the alley -- and only the alley. Worry about nothing else, and it will help the Bodyguard/Buyer so much.  Remaining three just have to deal with the front and side alley. This is a very simple mission but it's funny how it always goes wrong because no roles are assigned."
gtaonline,3dyfzv,jason_stanfield,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:34 2015 UTC,"My plan is always:   The host/handler and bodyguard on the ground go into a garage which opens up right next to the spot where the exchange happens. The package carrier hangs back while the bodyguard takes care of any hostiles that enter the parking lot. The lookout by the car park entrance uses grenades (carefully) to dispatch FIB cars, then turns attention to the ""side"" alley, occasionally looking back to the parking lot entrance for FIB agents sneaking in. Side alley coverage is assisted by the bodyguard on the ground. The other lookout covers the ""rear"" alley, and occasionally checks to see if anyone has slipped in the entrance.  The FIB agents show up in two waves; once the first is over, check your health and armor & snack up. When the numbers of FIB agents slim out, the bodyguard and package carrier jump in a car and haul ass. If there are any hostiles still around, duck while getting away. The lookouts take care of any remaining agents, carefully, before escaping.   I've done it this way a dozen times without fail. As long as no one fucks around or takes chances, it should work without breaking a sweat, but if there's anyone on the team unfamiliar with it, be prepared to run it that way a few times. Other advice:   If you've read this and it works for you, and you pick up a new crew in the week, use the minute you have after arriving at the parking lot to run around and explain what to do. The lookout closest to the entrance needs a grenade launcher or missile launcher he/she is good with.  EVERYONE needs the special carbine assault rifle, with grip (better aim), without suppressor (better damage), and with the extended clip (less reloading). It has very good stopping power and range. The host should allow for player-saved outfits, and everyone that can do so should get into their heavy combat gear. If executed well, you shouldn't need it, but you never know when you're going to get mulched by someone you can't see."
gtaonline,3dyfzv,northernwinds,2,Mon Jul 20 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"EVERYONE needs the special carbine assault rifle, with grip (better aim), without suppressor (better damage), and with the extended clip (less reloading).

gtaonline,3dyfzv,jason_stanfield,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:18:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't really prove that it'll help, but it sure seems like it does, and I have read elsewhere that suppressors can lessen damage. It certainly sounds more satisfying.  Right now I have the regular and the special carbine; the regular carbine has a suppressor on it, so I can quickly choose an assault rifle with one, but my special remains loud and effective."

I handle both alleys, and at this point, the lookouts kind of do whatever (my only request is that they get rid of the front guys whenever they appear). Once shooting dies down for a brief moment (a few seconds after the start of the firefight), I have the other ground player run to the garage (with the door that opens on approach) where s/he will stay until we leave.  Now, this basically means that one person does nothing at all, but we're fine with that -- I consider it risk management. The remaining ground guy also has to take the blunt of the attacks but you can see the enemies round the alley on the minimap."

gtaonline,3dyfzv,Saratje,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that there's a lot of people who aim too slow and cannot fire before the NPC's fire at them. It's aim-bam-next-aim-bam-cover. Or they wait until they confirm the enemy is dead. Just shoot at the enemy, head if you can and assume you killed them without checking, then immediately shoot the next and go right onto the third and so on. If you're not sure of killing them when you shoot them, practise a lot more, hesitation allows the NPC's buddy to shoot you before you shoot him first also. And rely on someone else to shoot whoever wasn't dead and got up again. Just go Han Solo on these guys, shoot first.  As for the reinforcements. Shooting with a grenade launcher at cars with people taking cover behind is deadly for NPC's. With one person using explosives, that leaves 3 more people to pick off NPC's with automatic rifles or such."
gtaonline,3dyfzv,CanaBusdream,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:01:36 2015 UTC,I like being the south lookout.

gtaonline,3dzytr,WTFisFTWbackwards,2,Mon Jul 20 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"Thats not specific to PS3, nor to the Series A heist - it happens for people on all platforms, or various of heists. Me for instance - I am on a PC, and my second toon is not getting called by Lester for The Prison Break heist now 4th day in a row.  I read a lot on the subject and people suggest:  - doing jobs  - adversary modes  - replaying previous heists.  I did all that, except replaying the Fleeca job, because I can't. For some reason even if I request a replay Lester doesn't set it up.  I also deleted my local profile, just to be on the safe side. Furthermore, I completely removed GTA from my PC (along with all annoying registries and whatnot) and then I reinstalled the game anew.  Nothing!  I can't be 100% sure, but I am 99% confident that whatever that bug is, it seems to be coming from the Rockstar end.  I will wait a day or two more and then I will file a ticket to see what they can do about that, if anything at all. Considering my last ticket (which included a video showing people cheat [flying cop cars and raining bags of money]), I am not really sure that they will be able to do something.  EDIT: I was able to finally replay the Fleeca job and that didn't fix it either, Lester is still not calling for The Prison Break heist."

gtaonline,3dzpiq,dsavla,11,Mon Jul 20 21:10:30 2015 UTC,"Every one buy the heavy utility vest, and save it in an outfit.  Do all Heists with player saved outfits using the vest.  This cuts down ALL damage by half. Everything that CAN be done from inside a Kuruma MUST be done from inside a kuruma. Whenever you are driving in an unarmored vehicle, keep your inventory open to the armor screen.  Equip a new heavy armor as soon as your current armor wears out, before you lose health.  You can still drive and shoot with this menu open. Fill up armor and snacks before each mission.   Obviously, keep in good communication.  Support and back each other up.  Don't get too far ahead or too far behind the group.    A few mission specific tips:  Prison Break: *Plane - stay in the kuruma to kill the vagos *Wetwork - City hall team after you kill the lawyers, drive up in a kuruma, jump out just next to the briefcase and get back in the car. *Finale - Pilot get behind the jet and you can just follow it slowly.   Humane Labs *Insurgents - Stay in the quarry while you shoot down the helicopters.  Stay together for mutual fire support. *EMP - Don't crash *Valkyrie - Stay in the kuruma and drive straight to the chopper.  Choose a good pilot.  Hover slightly above the enemy choppers and keep the nose pointed at them.  This optimizes aiming for the main gun.  It's best to stay in one place and wait for them to come to you.  Just over the Merriweather dock works fine. *Deliver EMP - Talk to each other and coordinate your shots    Series A *Coke - Heavy utility vests and combat shotguns *Trash Truck - Back the truck up close to the garbage to minimize running time.  Blow up the gas station before you get off the truck. *Weed - Drive down the western highway. *Meth - Stay in the kuruma *Finale - Keep your Armor screen open.    Pacific Standard *Vans - If you can't do this one without dying, you have no hope. *Signal - 2 options: either Lose the wanted level in the inland sea OR Drive to the second set of jetskis at the foot of the second bridge on the western highway in your Kuruma.  You can come back here and stay in your kuruma while evading the cops. *Hack - One person get the van.  The rest drive straight to the location and kill everyone from inside your kuruma. *Convoy - Kill everyone from cover behind your kuruma (or from inside).  Wait at the bridge and snipe all of the choppers.  Drive straight to the drop off and then kill meriweather jeeps.  You don't have to lose them before you go to the drop off. *Bikes - Drive together.  When leaving the compound, go straight and through the park before turning right.  This avoids roadblocks.  And to repeat myself, stay in the kuruma when killing bikers. *Finale - DO NOT KILL ANY HOSTAGES.  This makes your drive much more difficult.  One person get all the money and hide in the back while the other three clear the path.  Look up and use the kuruma glitch.    Remember your challenge isn't lost if you fail a setup or finale, only if you die while failing.  For example, letting Kashkovsky die, blowing up the velum, or alerting guards during delivering EMP do not fail the challenge as long as you don't die.  Finally, DON'T BE STUPID.  Some people think using your kuruma all the time is cheap.  I disagree, because they unlock the car during the first heist.  Also, the goal is to NOT die.  Makes sense to me to stay in your armored car.  Good luck.  Edit: formatting Edit2: Fucking formatting"

I NEED EVERYONE TO IMPRINT THIS INTO THEIR BRAIN!    Every random invite I take for the hack setup does not know this, I say ""Only the van driver needs the van. Everyone else can go to the spot, please do this, it's much quicker, and easier."" After arguing my point, the three others go to the van, I go to the spot, clean house, and do the jerk action when they show up.    And to add onto this, once you're in the getaway van, do NOT take the GPS route, stay away from it. You'll cut down on road blocks and cars chasing you."

I understand very little of all that so don't ask me any questions. All I know is that things improved drastically when I did the port forwarding thing with my router, and connected the Xbox to it via Ethernet.  The biggest thing was ensuring NAT was set to ""open""; if it's ""moderate"" or ""strict"" you're gonna have a bad time. That's what Ethernet solved for me.  Things are way better, but still not perfect. I lag out of setup lobbies all the time, and invitees to races and jobs often vanish. I think some of that can be blamed on the nature of the connections to others being P2P, and that very few people have optimal network settings.

The mission doesn't fail if the Lectros go kaboom."
gtaonline,3dxvw6,Richardhur,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:58 2015 UTC,"Blowing up the bikes is a quick work-around for everyone getting on and then off the bikes.   Blow them up, the game moves onto the next mission objective. This allows you to spawn into the apartment quicker"
gtaonline,3dxvw6,NearlyCompetent,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"One disadvantage though: If you don't get on the bikes properly (one person per bike), you'll get roadblocks and NOOSE cars all the way, which makes driving very painful and sometimes even results in cops ramming you off the road. At worst, you can end up with the car in the water and ... well, that's a fail. Plus a chance for accidental deaths by freak headshots into the Kuruma or when getting into the dinghy. If you get on the bikes first and then go to the apartment, you're at 2-star wanted most of the way, no roadblocks and very little danger of accidental deaths."
gtaonline,3dxvw6,Richardhur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:35 2015 UTC,Duno why you think blowing up bikes would trigger noose. Noose only comes if you botch the initial bank heist and someone hits an alarm. Blowing up the bikes has no effect on if noose shows up or not.  The Pac Standard heist I did last night went just as you described it. We take the left coast highway all the way to the dingy and didn't see a single cop until 150m from the boat.
gtaonline,3dxvw6,WpPrRz_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"Did this a few times on PC, closest apartment to where the bikes are kept. Everyone make it to the bikes, get on. Get off once prompted to go to the Canyon. Run to the entrance of the building. Have owner of apartment enter. Invite players in. Move players to garage. Enter vehicle and exit garage. Go on highway till after tunnel. Go offroad. Get on boat. EZ money."

gtaonline,3dxvw6,znyx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:14 2015 UTC,"You all get on one bike each, then two get off and go onto the other ones.  Then you grad for the red parking garage. On its right there is a so called ""Wall breach"".  All you have to do then is to drive into the ""white sea"" and hold the handbrake and lean backwards like a wheelie.  This will make you fly under the map and where you want to get of, you press Y the get of the bike and you will spawn back up on the surface.  I recommend you try this in freeroam first. You have to be two people on the bike for it to work."

gtaonline,3dxvw6,troyadamietz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"yes - did it yesterday with my crew. also note that you don't have to go to the last checkpoint by the bridge where you would normally jump / ditch your bikes and parachute down. Right before the sharp curve leading to that final point is a road to the right that takes you right down to the water / boat.   If you don't / can't do the Kuruma and can't handle the bikes, take a bike then ditch it as soon as you leave the parking area and steal a car. You can easily make it everytime unless you are playing with randoms that get killed for fun and grief"
gtaonline,3dxvw6,shadow306k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't see what the need is for a Kuruma-A for the bike section. The last time I did it, we had two people per bike, with the least confident drivers on the back, and didn't have too much hassle getting to the boat."
gtaonline,3dxvw6,zdelusion,3,Mon Jul 20 13:33:30 2015 UTC,"Karuma is way safer. Especially with randoms. Bikes aren't hard, but they are very punishing. One mistake and you're pretty much done, which can be frustrating when you're losing 100k from the pot each run. If you're doing CM it's the most surefire way since it's pretty much 100%, especially if you take the highway instead of the tunnel and just drive the boat into the water under the dingy."
gtaonline,3dxvw6,ILoveRegenHealth,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:50 2015 UTC,"I think that's a good way of putting it. It's not hard but one mistake is costly.  And I've noticed about three different levels of cops after a restart. ""Level 1 and 2"" are lighter, but Level 3 is insane. Roadblocks, helicopters and cops hanging off of SUVs. It's either random or sequential based on restarts, but all I know is I'd rather drive in a car or Kuruma and be safe than take my chances encountering that. Even the best Rank 300 player would find that intimidating and highly risky."
gtaonline,3dxvw6,jason_stanfield,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:36:46 2015 UTC,That's possible if all of you know to chill during the escape.  Everyone I've ever done Pacific with is a cowboy that drives recklessly.
gtaonline,3dxvw6,Halagini,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"the guy who is going to get his kuruma has to drive first and get to the apartment door before the helicopters get close  once inside, everyone enters the kuruma then follows lesters route  driving directly to the dingy is a dumb idea because you have five helicopters circling over you, slowly driving down the mountain gets rid of the cops completely"
gtaonline,3dyini,l3lueInfinity,16,Mon Jul 20 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely salty.  The game is meant to be played over time, you're not supposed to have everything as quick as the short single player game.  And there's no excuse for not having money right now, the Prison Break heist was just double money and RP for 4 days and this week Humane Labs is the same.  Join a crew, find friends and use /r/HeistTeams for players, there's plenty of money to be made."
gtaonline,3dyini,MidClubGamer,2,Mon Jul 20 16:13:54 2015 UTC,"Bingo. It's like an mmo, if you could easily max everything then there would be no incentive to keep playing, since once everything is achieved there's not much left to do."
gtaonline,3dyini,bearjuani,2,Mon Jul 20 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"The best thing, IMO, is to simply wait until you have the 40 or so required wins to upgrade car performance completely.  Unfortunately, there's no discounted price on better upgrades, so don't even bother until you can get the top tier options.  Yeah, it's expensive, and yeah, you've got to work for it, and yeah, it kind of sucks that the economies of story mode and online are so out of balance (you can end story mode with over $2.1 billion, far more than you'll ever need) ... but it is what it is.  Like u/MidClubGamer said, this is a great week for grinding; the Humane Labs heist pays double, and it pays well to begin with.  This week, on Hard, each setup job will pay you $51,300, and a 20% cut of the finale will pay you $270,000 ... if you do all the setups and get that 20%, you're looking at $526,500 in about an hour's time. Do that twice , and you've got over a million. Do that twice every day this week, and there's $6.3  MILLION.  EDIT: Fixed math."

I something similar happen while on the ground. The demo tilted the buzzard forward and the main rotor just chewed a guy up while on the beach. Thankfully it was on normal so we still made it out of there. I was pilot for that one.  Other fun heist finale I had. One guy quits during the escape flight because two police copters were following the plane and we couldn't lose them.  The demo had never got into the buzzard, he was driving around in a red merryweather canis mesa the entire time. I was the prisoner on that one.  Then there was one where the demo FOLLOWED ME TO THE AIRPORT. One of the ground team left. We reformed the same team and tried again. Same roles. The demo called us a noob team, and then 3 minutes later failed the mission. Somehow.  The best though, is when I managed to avoid a troll demo by being the demo myself. We had to have a few tries though. The ground team died a couple times, alerted the police once... I even got blown up once while trying to air support the prison team. I didn't get blown up by the prison for getting too close though. Oh no. The jet happened to fly by me, and thought I'd make great missile practice.  Finally on the last attempt, everything goes well. I'm about to land on the beach to pick them up... and the prisoner dies while parachuting. I just stopped for the day after that. I planned to try more later but never did.  Edit: It wasn't ALL bad though. The best prison break run I ever did was the first one I tried this weekend. It was with 3 randoms. We did the whole thing on hard with only ONE failure, on a set up mission. It was the police station set up, and a random pedestrian ran over my teammate when we were trying to get a police cruiser.  We were 2 minutes shy of getting the elite challenge. First try. With randoms. My god was that a great heist."

It was extremely disappointing, as we definitely wasted several hours, thereby reducing the overall production for the weekend.

No. Race wins only count towards unlocking upgrades (and eventually the chrome finish) if you win them against an opponent.

Now, some people will tell you that you have to win those races in each car category (sports, super, compacts, etc.), but that's absolutely NOT true. If you win ANY LAND RACES - any category of car, or motorcycle, or bicycle - they all count towards all car upgrade unlocks (bold for benefit of those who still don't understand). You can win fifty bicycle races, and unlock every performance upgrade, as well as the chrome finish, for all customizable vehicles.  Other races you'll need to win:  1 Sea Race - unlocks some matte colors  1 Air Race - unlocks some other matte colors (helicopters count)  1 Rally Race - unlocks three metal finishes (brushed aluminum, steel, etc.)  Most everything else at LSC is unlocked by rank, such as armor (rank 40 = 40%, rank 60 = 60%, etc.).

gtaonline,3dx80i,uberduger,3,Mon Jul 20 08:04:13 2015 UTC,"I heard that there are customized NPC vehicles that sell for 9,000+    Sandking XL: At the RV dealership across from the Los Santos Customs. 9am - 5pm. Spawn with another Sandking XL (the four door version) by approaching location from dirt roads to the south or east. $17,500 for the yellow one, $18,500 for the blue one. These are the most reliable customized NPC cars, and AFAIK the ones that sell for the most money. Sentinel XS: In front of Tequi-La-La on Vinewood Blvd. 10pm - 4am. Spawn with another Sentinel or coupe by driving a two block loop to the SE of the club. $14,500 for the yellow one, $17,500 for the blue one. These used to be common, but they're very hard to spawn now. Gang cars: In Strawberry and Davis, you can sometimes see a customized Peyote, Tornado, or other classic car. Head to YouTube for some videos on spawning them. I haven't bothered with these, since they don't bring even as much as standard Ballers or Felon GTs, and those you can steal without being Swiss cheesed by gang members. Others: A variety of other cars that can be found that don't sell for as much. So far, I've seen a purple Gauntlet, a yellow and black Ruiner, and a blue Dominator. Two of them I spawned from inside a mission in the parking lots of the Los Santos Customs locations in Rockford Hills (near the big mall) and the one at the airport. The Dominator sells for $19,000+, and the other two above sell for around $9,000. Dubsta: There's a chrome version and a shiny gold version, both with spare tire and luggage rack. They sell for $23-24,000. Thing is, I can't confirm that these are still spawn-able (on Xbox One, at least) without the use of a friend's chrome Dubsta. Locations and times vary, and I'm not sure what the current method is. I've been trying a number of tactics the last couple of days, and will post to r/gtaonline when I can confirm a reliable spawning technique.   Obviously, my go-to is the Sandking XL. It's reliable, brings good money, and lots of fun to drive around the jagged terrain in Grand Senora Desert."

I've tried a stock dubsta from the street, a dubsta 6x6, my Karuma and every other modded car that I have found. Every time I drive any of those around it seems that the traffic is 60% dubsta, but never a chromed one to be found so far."

Once you have one, they're not so elusive (still hard to spawn); it's just getting that first one that is so damn hard."

Another reason may be the fact that there are still AAA games coming to PS3/X360. 7th and 8th concoles' cycles still overlap at this moment.

gtaonline,3durdl,Decoy3,2,Mon Jul 20 03:52:33 2015 UTC,"The preceding corner is a huge factor in what happens during the straight. If she took a better line, she's exiting the corner at a higher speed than you, and hits top speed sooner. And if you're giving it full throttle on the exit, it's easy to get some wheel spin which will cut your traction abd make it take even longer for you to hit top speed.  It's impossible to be certain without seeing the race, but that's probably the most likely explanation."

gtaonline,3duh0j,peros2,7,Sun Jul 19 16:36:16 2015 UTC,Check out Broughy1322 on YouTube.  He has a lot of detailed analysis of vehicles for racing. Also has a series of best vehicles for racing by class. Really informative.
gtaonline,3duh0j,nazrugul,2,Sun Jul 19 20:12:31 2015 UTC,"I only buy the turbo upgrade after I have purchased both engine and transmission modifications, it seems much more effective."
gtaonline,3duh0j,tbertuzzi44,3,Mon Jul 20 18:55:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, but some are obviously better than others. Engine is always worth upgrading. Suspension doesn't do much but is cheap. Transmission will improve acceleration even if the bar is full also, but is expensive for how little benefit you get.  I almost always upgrade engine/suspension. I put the Turbo on some cars because I'm not made of money and only rarely upgrade transmissions because I just don't think it's worth the money unless I'm really trying to get a car in racing shape.  If money isn't an issue (or if you really want to trick a car out and don't care about the cost) go ahead and upgrade all of the above things because they'll help. And don't forget to add a spoiler if there's one available for the traction increase. Doesn't even have to be a spoiler, a spare tire or roof rack has the same effect ...for some reason."
gtaonline,3duh0j,zoidberg1339,2,Sun Jul 19 16:51:25 2015 UTC,Huh. I had always assumed the spoiler was just aesthetic.
gtaonline,3duh0j,waterbuffalo750,8,Sun Jul 19 16:58:07 2015 UTC,Used to be. Changed in an update a while back.

gtaonline,3duh0j,AjPjSay,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"Suspension is one of those things that doesn't make a huge difference, if any.  It's like using different spoilers, some people swear by it and some say it does nothing.  Check out Broughy1322's video on ""how to go faster"".  He goes through all of the upgrades and tell you which make a big difference.   He puts suspension in the ""fine tuning"" section.  Basically, its only going to matter if you're at the top end of hotlapping.  It's never going to make that big of a difference in a contact race, or most driving environments."

I mean, I would love to only ever play Pac Standard Finales over and over and over again, but if everyone sets their quick job app to that then nobody would ever get the setups done.  That said, I really wish they would let you do some of the setups without the full number of players. It's a pain in the ass to spend so much time waiting for people to join your heist when you could easily do it on your own, especially when some of the players actually make it harder or quit on you before the mission is over."
gtaonline,3ds7xw,Born_Ruff,2,Sun Jul 19 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I think that they couldn't do this so specifically.  They could just let you choose the heist, not the individual setup.

As far as user experience goes in this game there so many areas the game could've easily improved on.  One piece of feedback I can give if you don't mind is to make the prep missions as large as the rest of the items on the list. The status dot's are enough of an indicator that it's part of the drop-down. Some smaller tv's etc. may have trouble with small text like that. Other than that this would be a way better system.  Even something similar for general missions selection, for consistency sake not to have to go through the menu-> online -> jobs etc.   Most of my friends don't even know how to start whatever mission you want, because the full job list is hidden away. Anyway hopefully they'll take this into account. They've done a decent job at improving the in-game  websites."

I guess you made a post to vent about it while I told them myself. Yeah, you can still say its my fault but I only spent the past month playing this game and I didn't know that if you drove into a full garage, your replaced vehicle will be gone forever.  I had to learn the hard way by losing a car worth 2.2mil, thats about 1/3 of what i've made in total in the game. If I never looked up rockstar customer service and stumbled upon your few posts regarding that subject, I probably wouldn't have made the last statement about horrible customer service and probably would've gave up when they said they couldn't do anything the first time."

It is just amazing how you blame someone for your own mistake."

Leaving missions, destroying personals, quitting 1v1's etc  If you've been decreasing your rating over time with said activities, and don't notice that you're listed as a ""dodgy"" player, it could very well only take 1 car to reach Bad Sport.

gtaonline,3dtly1,w0ss4g3,2,Sun Jul 19 10:26:06 2015 UTC,"The view from weazel isn't bad either. I suppose tinsel is slightly better, but it's pretty close!"
gtaonline,3dtly1,tobaccotradingLizard,4,Sun Jul 19 11:02:09 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Weazel 101 has a nice view, especially at night."
gtaonline,3dtly1,caffelightning,3,Sun Jul 19 11:32:09 2015 UTC,"Yep, ordered :)"
gtaonline,3dtly1,JiveTurkey1983,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:48:27 2015 UTC,"Weazel is good because of it's location. It has multiple escape routes because the garage is separated and because it's not the most expensive apartment, most people don't use it as their primary (pretty much everyone uses Eclipse). This means there's a lot less bullshit going on outside. You're very unlikely to walk out the front door/garage and get shot in the face instantly.    For heists I'll admit that I tend to like eclipse MARGINALLY more though because it starts further north which shortens quite a few of the drives."
gtaonline,3dtly1,boogie84,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:07:22 2015 UTC,"I got rid of my Eclipse because I hated being so far north. The heists, however, definitely changed the game."
gtaonline,3dtly1,Mojo_666,2,Sun Jul 19 17:44:15 2015 UTC,I have two high end apartments. One is Weazel 101; as already discussed it has awesome views and is in a great location. My second one is across the street at Richards Majestic.. apartment 51. This one also has a great view to the west and the north. You can see the golf course and even Vinewood Hills sign.

I called Lester to get the cops off me after sniping the driver, which means actually stealing the car got them BACK on me. They chased me down the mountain and I accidentally stuck the tornado in a drainage grate, and couldn't get it out.  Time to wait 40 minutes for sunset to come around again..."
gtaonline,3dspzl,StefanGagne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:44:53 2015 UTC,"The first time I almost died when I was getting in the car. I landed in front of it and killed them, and started to run into the car, almost dying on the way. I barely made it and was able to call Lester before they found me again.  It's hard, and I usually land in a nearby area (far enough so that the event happens) and move the controller while waiting. Of course, it's good to stay in a closed session to make sure no one comes and screws it up."
gtaonline,3dspzl,zoidberg1339,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:17:09 2015 UTC,"After a second attempt, I got mine!  Key was to snipe the driver AND all the initially spawned cops, then call Lester... and wait for the other cops that showed up from the alert to leave the area. (The cops spawned by the easter egg will just stand there, so they have to die first.) Once it's clear, move the two cop cars out of the way, grab the Tornado, and drive it back down the mountain.  iViva! I even made a mariachi outfit, but unfortunately my hat vanishes when I sit in the car. Bummer."

gtaonline,3duy04,SitrucD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:50:01 2015 UTC,They don't allow it. They've explicitly stated any modding that alters the gameplay or mechanics of Online is prohibited. It's just that the way GTA:O's networking is set up and R*'s lack of anti-cheat that allows so many modders to run rampant.
gtaonline,3duy04,Erystia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"Modding on online is possible but it's not allowed. If you mod online you are likely to get banned... in any console.

gtaonline,3dvh2k,Mojo_666,-3,Sun Jul 19 23:31:44 2015 UTC,Are you trying to make some sort of point here? They've already made it clear they have no intentions of letting me know what rules I've broken or lifting the ban. The least I can do at this point is at least let others know that some people are being banned for hacker money they didn't ask for.
gtaonline,3dvh2k,ouchimus,6,Mon Jul 20 02:40:04 2015 UTC,No you won't. Source: have gotten >40 million. Not banned once.
gtaonline,3dvh2k,MrLeppy,5,Sun Jul 19 22:27:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, OP isn't giving us the whole story."
gtaonline,3dvh2k,TrollOfCentury,-9,Sun Jul 19 22:35:41 2015 UTC,So your experience means it's not possible? The whole story is I play legit and was banned. Never exploited or cheated in any way.  My source is I've received close to 50 million in the last 45 days or so and now I'm banned.
gtaonline,3dvh2k,ouchimus,4,Sun Jul 19 22:51:53 2015 UTC,Your title said that you are guaranteed to be banned if you receive modder money; you said nothing about it just being possible.
gtaonline,3dvh2k,WpPrRz_,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:49:44 2015 UTC,Yes and shortly after making this post I would have changed the title if that were possible.
gtaonline,3dvh2k,Mictron,3,Mon Jul 20 02:52:20 2015 UTC,"your title claims that receiving money WILL get you banned, therefore my case alone proves you wrong rockstar themselves have said you can't get banned for this"

gtaonline,3dvh2k,tic226n,-4,Mon Jul 20 01:45:11 2015 UTC,Yes. My sentiments exactly. I paid for the game and expect it to be playable whenever I want. I also expect to not have to worry if 'today is the day' I get banned for a longer period of time yet again for not breaking the terms of our agreement. I've already asked Valve to remove the game from my list.

We get banned for 2 weeks from competitive CSGO just for kicking too many people or leaving too many games due to disconnects.  GTA players have it easy as far as bans go... you can blatantly hack and grief then receive a 2 week.... in VAC secured games you're banned forever (i.e. until you get a new steam account) if you get vacced. You also get your account trade locked, so people that have 1000s of REAL LIFE dollars put into CSGO items are fucked and can't trade or use them (in vac secured servers) ever again.  Too bad so sad."

gtaonline,3dvh2k,majoroutage,-3,Sun Jul 19 22:03:13 2015 UTC,So I was stupid for minding my own business and having large sums of money dropped on my head so fast that an error comes up on my screen preventing me from doing anything including leaving the session? I had to control alt delete the game once because I literally couldn't get out of it during a money rain storm.
gtaonline,3dvh2k,GalaxyBread,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:15:53 2015 UTC,"So you couldn't just leave the area or the session because you had money raining on you? lol you just don't get millions given to you at once, you actually have to stay there for a few minutes and i am sure you were trying your hardest to leave when the money was dropping huh?"
gtaonline,3dvh2k,shadow306k,3,Mon Jul 20 00:26:31 2015 UTC,You've clearly never had this happen to you. When the giant bags of money are raining on your head you get a warning page that pops up warning you that you're doing too many things at once and you have to press enter/A to continue but it just pops back up instantly and you can't get to the game menu. At this point the only way to stop this is to contorl+alt+delete the game.  The first time this happened I wasn't expecting this and had accrued about 25 million dollars by the time I did control+alt+delete... Furiously trying to get to the game menu the entire time.

gtaonline,3dtkih,Corkstercorey,2,Sun Jul 19 11:44:17 2015 UTC,"I just completely fell in love with it on day one (not that that matters much). – The appearance, the sound, pretty decent handling and speed, and not bad offroad at all, in my opinion. (I dare say that the range of speed where it works the best, is also best suited for offroad, from what I have experienced.)  As mentioned, the brakes are pretty bad, so keep those in mind, but you'll get used to them soon enough unless you drive like a complete moron (well, let's be honest, all of us do from time to time because it's fun, hah). Though they're still nowhere near as bad as, say, the Patriot, as far as I remember. The ride height obviously doesn't hurt either for going offroad, and if you consider pimping it for appearance, you might wanna consider not adding any more bumpers or crap, since it does affects the angles you can climb when you go up or down when offroad (I'm pretty sure I've almost got stuck a few times because I did just that). I would personally say it handles pretty good (no extreme under- or oversteer), and isn't bad at all when you've added turbo and all those other performance enhancements, when it comes to speed and acceleration. Though it has to be said that I haven't raced against anyone in it yet. (And yes, you will obviously roll it over sooner or later.)  As always, it surely depends on preference – and in some cases how good of a driver you are, but I'm sure as hell am not gonna sell my Brawler anytime soon. I'd rather just have the Brawler than the Dubsta 6x6 (and I currently do have both, and I haven't even touched the monster truck either since I got the Brawler).  And it's gotta be said, that I mostly use it to dick around in freemode and have fun with, or when I'm doing mission by myself. And that there are obviously faster cars out there with better acceleration, and maybe better offroad qualities too. But for what it is, I dare say that it's not bad."

It won't win any races vs sanchez, unless maybe on some corner-free and bumpy track.

The Osiris and T20 are marginally faster but the Zentorno is still competitive in races.    In heists and missions the Kuruma will help a lot. It also helps when you want to pop over to ammunation and top off your body armor without getting killed by your heistmates.

gtaonline,3dtexu,Angus_Read,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:32:19 2015 UTC,"Suspension will increase your traction, nothing really works for handling.  Offroad tires do help with bumps from what I understand.  I unfortunately can't answer your main question."
gtaonline,3dtexu,Strykerius,2,Sun Jul 19 07:39:30 2015 UTC,Suspension doesn't increase your traction. Spoilers do increase your tractions though.
gtaonline,3dtexu,Angus_Read,2,Sun Jul 19 07:53:50 2015 UTC,Lowering the suspension does have a noticeable effect on the traction of a vehicle due to lowering the center of gravity.  However bumps will cause you to break your grip with the road.  There are a few videos that cover and prove this unless it was changed in an update recently.

I'm level 110 and have done the 'big boy heists' as the other commenter calls them, dozens of times and gotten platinum many times as well, but the hacking does take me a while. Sometimes it's my poor reflexes but I feel like there may be a lag aspect to it as well. I swear I press the button at the correct time, but it moves just a millisecond too late and hits a wall. Driving, shooting, piloting helicopters and planes are all easier than the hacking, in my opinion. Those activities are less precise and you can recover from mistakes. Hacking, you cannot recover."

gtaonline,3ds2sg,caticuss14,4,Sat Jul 18 22:31:23 2015 UTC,"I did my criminal mastermind entirely with players from r/heistteams. Mind you, we heisted a bunch of times first and then all decided to do CM after. But they were entirely from r/heistteams originally.    You do not need to be level 130 (135 is actually the armor cap though IIRC). You should have no major problems doing it at 60+ (it IS helpful to have things like grenade launchers, but not everyone needs them either), but it will be easier above 100 where your health caps out. 135 should be entirely unnecessary as if you're with a good crew, i honestly can't see going through 10 armors on a single mission. I only used 1 extra armor the entire CM run and I didn't truthfully need to, I ended that mission with 100% armor which made it a waste. The better the people you play with, the less damage you tend to take.    If you want to make it even easier, make sure you're putting your kuruma through hell. Use it on the key failure missions: prison finale, garbage truck etc. The ones everyone hates can almost always be kuruma'd.    And use the damage reduction heist armor, even when you think you don't need it. Don't take unnecessary risks (like riding motorcycles to mission objectives)."
gtaonline,3ds2sg,caffelightning,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:17:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!  What was the hardest setups for you to complete?
gtaonline,3ds2sg,caffelightning,2,Sat Jul 18 23:29:43 2015 UTC,"As weird as it sounds, nothing was really bad at all mainly because I was with good players (and you will be too). Missions that I absolutely HATE doing with pubs, with 3 other good people are actually not difficult at all. I think that in general Series A carries the greatest chance of failure because of the coke boat and trash truck.    Trash truck though we ended up doing legit and not using the kuruma and it was a joke though because again, with 3 other good aggressive players, we just didn't get surrounded. The second we pulled into the gas station or alley, we were launching grenades and blowing up cars. This was the mission I used the extra armor on but then didn't need it. I learned the kuruma trick after I did this, had I known it though, I'm sure we would've used it.    Other missions, that aren't necessarily difficult but have high failure rates are ""prison break - station"" because the casco people generally have a decent chance at dying while trying to drive off. But if you use tricks like taking the rails instead of roads, yea it takes longer, but its significantly safer.    In all honesty, the key is really just finding a good crew. I can't stress how easy it felt to do after it was all done and we looked back in hindsight. While talking during the pac standard closing video, all of us were literally like ""well, that was actually pretty easy"". Run through it all once with them, practice the tricks (like if you haven't done the kuruma prison, learn it first, then CM it) even if it means intentionally failing to retry, and then commit to a proper run after.    Hell, if there's missions you're worried about, hit me up in game or on Reddit and I can probably tell you the easiest way to do it and what to look out for and we can even run through it with a couple of your crew members.    EDIT: actually another hint that will save your run: you CAN fail missions. You just can't die. If you're in a scenario where someone might die or it's going badly, do something to intentionally fail the mission without dying. Blow up a key mission vehicle with a sticky, or go out of area etc. and then just restart the mission."
gtaonline,3ds2sg,caffelightning,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:39:33 2015 UTC,"I was always worried about Pac finale and some of the Series A missions, but what you wrote is reassuring. As long as I can find some good people to play with I'm sure it will go well. Thanks for the help."
gtaonline,3ds2sg,MafiaKilla36,2,Sat Jul 18 23:54:16 2015 UTC,"Pac finale just grenade launcher your way out of the bank and use the kuruma for the escape, most people have practiced the shit out of this from farming pac, so I wouldn't expect a failure on this one. Remember, it's criminal mastermind so you dont need to worry about maximizing the payout. All 4 people shooting is noticeably easier than 2 or 3 shooting. Just follow the proper waypoints in your kuruma and drop the stars. Again, takes longer, but safer. Practice going down the hill first though.    For series A, other than the 2 I listed, the rest are pretty trivial. There's a slighly easier path on weed where you can take the trucks down the west coast highway and then through the expressway in the middle of town. It's not deserted, but there's definitely like 1/3 the number of enemies."
gtaonline,3ds2sg,ArchBishopJosh,0,Sat Jul 18 23:57:58 2015 UTC,"I've done it and we really didn't do it legitimately.

I think from pure speed, the z-type is the fastest, but the coquette classic is probably next in line with impressive speed and acceleration. However the coquette classic is hard to handle.  The casco and stirling are quick and have good handling which makes them good for racing. IF you do plan to race, check out Broughy1322's videos.  The coquette black fin is technically a muscle car and not sports classic, but think of it as a slightly slower casco/stirling. It doesn't drive like the coquette classic much at all. The Stinger and Stinger GT are both slower than the others, and while they handle a bit better than the coquette classic, it's not by a large amount.  The hot knife is a boat. It's barely driveable but looks oh so cool.  The JB 700 looks tacky with the non functioning weapons, and it seems to have less speed and acceleration than the casco/stirling.  Honestly, if you're looking to buy a sports classic, the best rule of thumb I've found is ""Which looks the best?""  If you're going for performance, you're better off with a sports or super car. You go for sports classics for style. So pick the one you think looks the best."
gtaonline,3drgrz,DE4THWI5H,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:29:32 2015 UTC,"Between the Casco and Stirling, the Stirling has the option for a spoiler(tire) which does improve the handling quite a bit. Still handles well without, but it does help."
gtaonline,3drgrz,dennisc3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:35:49 2015 UTC,"Man, I don't care if it's a rocket booster disguised as a tire. Putting it on the back of a stirling uglies that thing up like nobody's business."
gtaonline,3drgrz,DE4THWI5H,4,Sat Jul 18 22:45:28 2015 UTC,I actually like the tire. The back just looks to bare without it.
gtaonline,3drgrz,dennisc3,4,Sun Jul 19 00:01:28 2015 UTC,"I have a whole 10 car garage full of sports classics.  If I had to choose just one to keep, it would be the Stirling GT."
gtaonline,3drgrz,jason_stanfield,3,Sat Jul 18 22:05:57 2015 UTC,Roosevelt. If it were still an option... Stirling Gt is insanely good though.

gtaonline,3drgrz,itsDirk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:24:33 2015 UTC,I just bought the Casco and love it! Reminds me of the Volvo P1800. Also a nice bonus: it's on sale right now! (50% off)
gtaonline,3drgrz,freekyeight,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:54:26 2015 UTC,"Stirling is the best overall, and then the z. I like both and it just depends what you think looks better but both are the top 2 in sports classics in terms of performance. I personally like how the z looks but the stirling is better in both acceleration and handling."
gtaonline,3drgrz,ElectricLuxray,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"Casco, since it's half price. Plus, when turbo charged the thing is a monster"

gtaonline,3drgrz,tobaccotradingLizard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:10:09 2015 UTC,"All of them! But seriously depends on your preferences. For racing i would recommend the Stirling GT, just has the best performance of them all. Other than that you might want to take a look at the Coquette Classic, Monroe, Stinger GT and Casco. The Coquette and Stinger like to slide a lot so there's that. Monroe and Casco are pretty nice to handle with the Casco being much quicker though.  Edit: Also the Casco appears to be 50% off right now so you might want to get it now."

Savage for solo flight, also great in missions I find.  All considered, savage because in between mission grinding and taking down smuggler planes and helicopters the savage starts paying for itself."
gtaonline,3dqxqy,G0ldCreeper,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:42:04 2015 UTC,What missions can you use helicopters for?
gtaonline,3dqxqy,andiamojuve,2,Sat Jul 18 19:20:02 2015 UTC,Defenders.  The one where you blow up the cement trucks.  Probably the trash talk one.  Basically any one where you don't need to make sure you don't blow up say the coke or documents.
gtaonline,3dqxqy,OneEyedMcGee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:31:50 2015 UTC,oh so you can just call up pegasus in those? awesome
gtaonline,3dqxqy,andiamojuve,2,Sun Jul 19 16:11:27 2015 UTC,Yup.  At least defenders. I haven't personally tried the others yet.
gtaonline,3dqxqy,OneEyedMcGee,2,Sun Jul 19 20:42:51 2015 UTC,I might just buy a buzzard Fast easy to move and can shoot
gtaonline,3dqxqy,Decoy3,2,Sat Jul 18 16:58:22 2015 UTC,"Buzzard is a good compromise. It can carry 4, but you can still use it solo.   Just make sure you have your chain gun selected before your co-pilot enters aiming mode if you want to be able to shoot."
gtaonline,3dqxqy,jaytrill,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:10:38 2015 UTC,I use my savage in lieu of my buzzard on most missions or solo play as I can still use the weapons. The Valkeri is nice but you need three others to use all weapons. It would also be good for missions but it would be boring for solo flights.
gtaonline,3dqxqy,tobaccotradingLizard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:44:35 2015 UTC,I personally feel that the Savage could use some more armor. Just from a few bullets that thing shouldn't start smoking like crazy.   The Valkyrie can take some more damage but as others said it only really stands out when having 3 more ppl with you.

Rockstar knows what you want, what we want, because I play, and I want a lot of the same things too (such as something to do past rank 100).  But the fact is that it takes time to make, and on top of that, sometimes it can't be made at all.  You also have to think about players on all other systems. You could easily say ""fuck 'em! PC Master Race!"", but R* can't. They have yet to leave PS3/XB360 players in the dust with their updates, giving them most of the same items as PC and Current-Gen consoles.   Tl;Dr - R* can't just jump to every request the community makes, even if they want to. They have to factor in what they actually can make, and what the systems can take."

There are things that work in favour of imbalance in DMs like power player, loser streak perks and in PVP in general like BP helmets. Annoying things like flashing screen on losing/winning streaks. Finding a normal job to join is a real challenge because all that pops up on call is crap like 10000$10000RPGLITCH for deathmatches and stunt races for races (R* is luckily going to distinguish stunt races from normal ones with new update though so thats good). Content creator is currently a mess. On new gen free aim lobbies are merged with free aim assisted and on old gen (I play on 360) I often get invites for auto aim jobs when I play free aim. The game can't handle 32 or 30 players on new gen and even 16/14 players on old gen. Even in free roam lagging out happens quite frequently on every system. List of issues goes on and on."

Unless you mean regular old climbing shoes, which really, are no different than normal shoes except they're small, pliable and have great rubber.  I'd be all for them adding climbing gear as I like to climb, but they should at least make it fit realistically with the world they've created.

You waste no money by dying and on ammo (if played forced+pickups/forced), you earn cash, there's no cops and so on. If you want to take cool action packed snaps with your bro with no cop interference just do them during a Gerard mission. Free roam should stay the way it is."
gtaonline,3dmvfu,JJFaFa,2,Fri Jul 17 20:52:56 2015 UTC,The reason is because we frequently have 20+ people in a crew session.  Those are the sessions I'd like to disable cops on.  Going to a lobby of any kind means everyone must be able to connect right then.  A cop free crew lobby would allow people to join/leave as needed.  Many of these lobbies last all night.  The change seems easy enough since as you pointed out certain game modes disable cops already.
gtaonline,3dmvfu,Blackknighl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:14:51 2015 UTC,They can't. The game is built around the cops coming after you after you do a crime. It'd be too easy to earn money and RP if the cops never chased you. You might as well ask to get rid of guns because it's unfair that other people have them.

gtaonline,3doh90,shadow306k,5,Fri Jul 17 23:55:12 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a bad tip, you got to wait on ambulances that way. I have no shortage of pedestrians to beat up on at the fairgrounds, as there's dozens at a time, while turning around spawns new ones wherever I weren't looking. The trick is using the melee attack while running after them at the exact right distance. If you do it right, your character auto-targets and sprints three times faster than with normal sprinting, to catch up and 'falcon punches' them onto the curb (they then usually launch spectacularly and fly 9 feet away from you before landing on their neck). If you quickly follow up to the next pedestrian, your character will sort of leapfrog from pedestrian to pedestrian, knocking them out real quickly in an Arkham Batman-esque manner. If you are just hitting one, then walking to the next, you're sort of doing it wrong. People often really don't seem to know you can go all Bruce Lee on NPC's if you learn to use distance and targeting and not targeting just right."

gtaonline,3dqh00,Jeysin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:24:40 2015 UTC,"Not really.  If you're looking for an off road truck, get the Sandking XL. It's better than the Guardian for off roading."
gtaonline,3dpg4w,Belskirnir_,2,Sat Jul 18 04:35:49 2015 UTC,"Grind heists/missions for rp firstly.  There are plenty of heist achievements so you are going to need a good crew to pull off all the heists with and all the heist achievements.   ""Criminal Mastermind"" is considered the hardest GTA online achievement. To complete it you will have to do all heists in order, with the same people, on hard difficulty, without dying. You also get a reward for getting this achievement being 10 million dollars.  So if you really want to do all the achievements; get a great heist crew, grind a lot of missions, start racing and get good at it, kill a lot in death-matches or in free-roam, and not to mention all the single player achievements (all of which you can watch a tutorial on I bet).  Seeing as many of your friends did not buy the game to play online you will have to make friends, and let me tell you the 360 community is pretty toxic and will take awhile to find a good heist crew that can listen and not complain.  I hope I helped you at least a bit with how to go about this. There are many threads here that can help you with heists and missions. There is also a subreddit that is dedicated to finding a heist crew, /r/heistcrews and this will help you, but from experience most of the people on there are on Xbone, PS4, or PC. It will still take awhile to find people on /r/heistcrews, but they're considerably better then letting random people play with you in heists. Stupidity seems to shine on heists with everyone, especially randoms that think it's okay to join a heist at level 6.  Sorry seems like I've been dragging this on, but there is a lot to know if you've been out of the loop for a while. Good Luck."

gtaonline,3dpg4w,exxonic,2,Sat Jul 18 06:12:19 2015 UTC,"finish the first heist. it will unlock the armored kuruma, best car for grinding missions. which i think are better for ranking up than heists.  for the heists. there are two awards that give you 1 million each: ""all in order"" and ""loyalty"". it will help towards the ""live a little""-achievement.  and allways finish your daily objectives when you are online! there are two awards that will give you good cash: ""goal oriented"" and ""over achiever"". and they will give you 25k cash and some thousand rp each day. but your straight will not be reset if you are not online.  chances are that if you find a nice crew you will love the online and do not want to grind."

gtaonline,3dp6cr,maukaone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:13:50 2015 UTC,I think you might just be right. It says 16/28.  I gotta let the other guys know. Hopefully I can get in touch with them again. Thanks!  You had the same thing happen on that mission? I wonder if Rockstar intentionally scripted that NPC to troll us or something.
gtaonline,3dp6cr,wickerBoar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:58:11 2015 UTC,"You always need to take into account panicking drivers, especially on CMC you should never put yourself in position where you can be driven over. On Trash Truck gas station you should pull up in a tiny alley, right next to the bags."

gtaonline,3dp6cr,TheMANzo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:34:14 2015 UTC,Is it possible to continue this with a different group of people just in case I can't get back in touch with the people I played with?

gtaonline,3do8m1,Trtlman,6,Fri Jul 17 21:55:52 2015 UTC,You have to do the set-ups everytime.
gtaonline,3do8m1,BackslashingfourthV,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"Those don't take long. The couple hours the whole heist takes making over 200,000 is about twice as much 2 hours of missions gives you."
gtaonline,3do8m1,MatticusVP,0,Fri Jul 17 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"Is that for all the heists, or only the last one? I feel like Ive done the Fleeca heist without doing both the setups every time."
gtaonline,3do8m1,Decoy3,2,Fri Jul 17 22:26:20 2015 UTC,"Are you hosting or just taking random invites from your phone? Because it's totally possible to only take finales as a crew member, but in every case the setups were completed by someone else."

gtaonline,3do8m1,Blackknighl,4,Fri Jul 17 23:04:24 2015 UTC,"The entire pac standard heist can be completed in around 90 minutes.  Each of the five setups pays a bit over 26k.  The finale pays 1,250,000.   I won't bring up splits here because that will cause a circle jerk over what's ""fair"",  you can do the math.  Swap hosts between each to avoid the 48 minute cool down and you can speed through to millions pretty quickly.  It's by far the quickest/easiest way to legitimately earn cash online."
gtaonline,3do8m1,jason_stanfield,4,Fri Jul 17 22:27:25 2015 UTC,"You have to do all the setups each time, plus there's an hour ""cool down"" before you can host it again. You can, however, swap hosts and run it again immediately after.  It should be noted, though, that this weekend the whole ""Prison Break"" heist pays double -- that's $38k per setup job, and $1 million to split at the end. It doesn't take as long, it's not as hard, and it almost pays as much as ""Pacific"" does."
