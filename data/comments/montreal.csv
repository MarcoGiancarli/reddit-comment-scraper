montreal,3e4gjr,Maple99Z,3,Tue Jul 21 22:26:46 2015 UTC,"Nice. I saw how the sun came out earlier while it was still raining.  Here's one I had taken at 5:45pm Saturday October 20th 2012 - http://imgur.com/FfGXAUH  And again another at 6:10pm Saturday October 7th 2013 -  http://imgur.com/x5BvdQL  I just thought I'd write Environment Canada about it and see what they'd say; here was their reply.      Hello,  Thank you for sending your pictures to Environment Canada.  While double rainbows don't happen often, they are not considered rare.  Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the sun.  In a ""primary rainbow"", the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side. This rainbow is caused by light being refracted while entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it.  Secondary rainbows are caused by a double reflection of sunlight inside the raindrops.  As a result of the second reflection, the colours of a secondary rainbow are inverted compared to the primary bow, with blue on the outside and red on the inside. The secondary rainbow is fainter than the primary because more light escapes from two reflections compared to one and because the rainbow itself is spread over a greater area of the sky.    Best regards,   Meteorological Inquiry Specialist MSC National Inquiry Response Team ISO 9001:2008 Environment Canada"

montreal,3e2zev,CaribouDodu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Jazz fest has changed significantly from when I was a young kid and came to Montreal with my family. Back then there were many more good free small shows, all around. Now it's turned more commercial and the free showings are generally lackluster for real jazz fans.  In the end, I love it and pay for the names I want to see. It is indeed more of a niche. People are willing to go downtown and walk around, but most people aren't willing to shell out 40 bucks or more for a good jazz show.  We end up with this split reality. Blues / rock outside free for the most part, some small jazz shows available too, with all the real good stuff costing money and mostly jazz fans paying to see those shows.  Comedy is much more accessible to most people, therefore it's not surprising that it would be a much larger and more lucrative festival."

A lot of tourists from around the globe come to MTL only for Jazz fest and for JFL sometimes even locals don't even know that there's a festival.

Anyway I think you're right, I can't remember the last time the jazz fest brought in a big artist for one of the outdoor shows (Stevie Wonder maybe?) unless you count Diana Krall last year. The outdoor lineup this year was pretty bare but the indoor lineup was killer, who knows why."
montreal,3e2zev,secularDog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:27 2015 UTC,Personal opinion: They have to finally bring the New Mastersounds to Jazzfest. It won't fix anything you pointed out but they would rock the whole fest.  Related to what you said I don't think Jazzfest can afford to have the big names play free shows. I don't see much revenue there.

If you are a person of colour, then you'll face similar challenges to what you'll find in any white-majority society, but no greater that elsewhere, and probably less than elsewhere.  Generally, Montreal is a very multicultural place, it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else, and there is very little racial tension.  Reports of racism due to separatism, etc. are greatly exaggerated and are simply the result of our strange politics.   Your only problem is that you're coming here in October, which is not a very interesting time to visit.  Don't judge Montreal until you've seen both the winter and the summer."
montreal,3e3kmn,bopollo,7,Tue Jul 21 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"As /u/bopollo says you'll do fine. B2 is better than a lot of people who come here. ~85% of the population is bilingual, you're biggest problems will be: people switching back to english when you want to speak french just because you have an accent (but just keep talking french - if they are francophones - unless it's really hindering the convo, the person will understand you want to practice); and the occasional slightly biggoted person who's already having a bad day that might be rude. The last one I've experienced pretty much everywhere I've been in the world while using my broken <insert local language>; as everywhere that is more prevalent further away you are from the big cities. But overall Montreal/Quebec in general is an incredibly tollerant and accepting place. We don't have massive antigay antiabortion demonstrations like France does. We don't have medium/large anti-immigrant demonstrations like PÉGIDA in Germany; in fact they cancelled theirs here because they were outnumbered 200~300:1 by the counter protest.  To quickly understand the complicated politics you can refer to Catalunia, Belgium, Scotland, and Ireland.  I agree with the seasonal comment to, October is the worst time to get through and can be very depressing. The winter that comes after is really hard but in someways less depressing. But if you are able to pull through that you will see how amazing this city can be and know that you can make it.  N.B. Getting a work visa/permanent residency can be difficult. You're first step should be looking for a work/travel visa of a year/year and half - AFAIK it is only available from select countries. Otherwise you may want to look at some other work visa programs (young professionals type thing) those generally require that you have a job offer already. Also IANAL/A! but if you're profession allows you to work remotely and you get paid in a bank account in your country of origin I believe you are allowed doing that during the length of your travel visa. Consult an immigration lawyer though."

Only reason I ask is because I don't think immigration lets you in the country if they think you're looking for work but you're coming here on a holiday. Just my experience from watching a couple of episodes of Border Patrol. Something to keep in mind...
montreal,3e3kmn,McBet,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:18 2015 UTC,"This. I wanted to ask the same question for the same reason: Border Patrol. They will verify how long you want to stay and how much cash you bring with you. If they see that you'll run out they'll ask you if you're looking for work. If you are honest with them, you'll be in trouble. If you lie... don't lie, not a good idea. Either way I think once they find out that you've come for work they will send you back from where you came from.

montreal,3e3kmn,alcatraz94,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"I immigrated to Quebec city in 1980. Things changed so much during three decades and a half. Back then, I was some kind of a ""curiosity"", especially since I was an Asian kid talking with a perfect French Canadian accent. Everywhere my family would go (restaurant, movie theatre, park, pool, shopping mall), you could feel the attention. Funny times.  Now, I live in Montreal since more than two decades where there are so many immigrants everywhere from different countries. For example, there are about 20 restaurants in a 4 kilometer radius around my house. The owners are from: Italy, Greece, China, Japan, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, USA, Canada, Mexico, Pakistan, India, Haïti, Argentina, Algeria, etc. For the most part, everyone is very welcoming and has that ""live, let live"" mentality to a certain point.  I've talked to coworkers, friends and acquaintances about immigration. Most of them agree that:  -right now, immigration is a necessity for Quebec. The active population keeps getting older, you need young people to replace them.  -most people are way more accepting/welcoming if you do the effort to adapt, to learn the culture, to speak French, to attend the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day events, to eat local meals. In other words: your home might be your ""native country embassy"", but outside try to blend with everyone  -most people hate immigrants who don't have a job or aren't actively looking for one. I can't blame them. It's as if a stranger would come to your home, but would stay on the couch all day instead of helping you with the chores and the bills  -if you manage to become interested about the Montreal Canadien (local NHL hockey team), most people will adore you. Btw, a nice way to befriend your coworkers is to participate in the office hockey pool. Advice: choose Carey ""Jesus"" Price, you can't go wrong with him.  -avoid at all cost talking about politics, especially Canadian politics. It's a very sensitive subject for most people. Also, religion is a sensitive subject. After all, it's a laic society.  I have relatives all around the world: Canada, USA, France, Belgium, Russia, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Australia and others that I forgot. Some of them visited me here in Montreal and they find that it's a great city compared to other similar cities in the world.  P.S.

J'ai eu besoin d'une chirurgie à St-Justine pour installer un paire de vis et un plaque de métal sur mon radius gauche et la même chose sur le cubitus gauche.   Ce qui m'a le plus marqué c'était à quelle point mon cas n'était pas grave... j'ai vu beaucoup d'enfant avec la tête rasé et l'autre patient dans la chambre avec moi était un jeune de 16-17 ans qui faisait du rollerblade et avait été frappé dans les hanches par une voiture. Il était plâtré au dessus du nombril jusqu'au genou.  Je me souviens que les infirmiers et infirmières était très gentil avec moi une erreur d'un(e) infirmier(e) a failli me blesser gravement ou peut-être même tuer. Une bonne donne de morphine me fut administrer après la chirurgie et j'avais même accès a un bouton pour me donner des doses de morphine moi même. Après avoir passé plusieurs heures (plus que 6) à me donner des ""shots"" de morphine suite à la chirurgie, je me rend compte que j'ai une énorme envie d'uriner. Je n'avais pas uriner pendant mes 6 heures de toxicomane. Je reste assis sur la toilette pendant 45 minutes, je suis incapable d'uriner et j'ais très, très mal à la vessie. Ma mère explique le problème à l'infirmière qui commence sont quart de travail et cette dernière comprend exactement ce qui se passe : la surdose de morphine que j'ai pris toute la journée paralyse le sphincter de ma vessie. Ma vessie est à pleine capacité, très douloureuse et doit être vidé immédiatement. L'infirmier(e) précédant qui me surveillait ne s'était pas assuré que je sois capable d'uriner. L'infirmière à du insérer une sonde dans mon urètre et forcer la sonde a pénétrer le sphincter de ma vessie. Extrêmement douloureux, mais le soulagement subsequent en valait la peine.  TLDR : Si vous prenez de la morphine, prenez un break pour faire pipi !"

montreal,3e09n4,kuoni666,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:50:18 2015 UTC,Yup I went to the emergency on the night of december 24th. Our 2 months old baby had ate close to nothing in the last 24 hours and was already diagnosed with an illness and we were told to come back if she stopped eating. We waited a good 6 hours during the night but were under observation. Once the personel started seeing us they apologized for the wait saying that they had to reanimate 2 kids. During the evaluation process in the ER they had to leave because one of the kid's heart stopped again. Our daughter was hospitalized for 3 days. We got a proper diagnosis this time and our daughter has been improving since. The illness that she had is now gone and she's healthy like any normal baby. It's an old hospital but other than that it's an awesome hospital. Better than Maisonneuve-Rosemont that's for sure.  edit(s): grammar.
montreal,3e09n4,rillettes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:55 2015 UTC,"Our kid was born there 7 years ago. It was mostly a good experience. The birthing room was nice and cool. There was a computer on in the corner, with the web page open to Match.com. I have no idea what that was about.  I was called to do the administrative stuff at about 3 in the morning, while my SO was in full contractions. The lady was taking her sweet ol' time checking me in, and then started getting real ""personal."" IOW, when she found out that my mother tongue was french and the mother's was english, she got all snide about in what language we were going to raise our kid. Thought that was strange and inappropriate.  But the birthing staff were great. When my SO finally accepted the epideral, there was one nurse who kept looking at me, expecting me to faint or something. I guess that's something that happens.  When the lad was born, one nurse tried to take him away to wash him off, even though we were very explicit about not wanting that. She almost dropped him when everyone was screaming at her to bring him back.  As to ER visits, those have been mostly good, though one night, after being there 6 hours and watching nurses walk back and forth and even change shifts without acknowledging anyone in the waiting room, we decided to leave.  Oh, and it helps to have quick, attentive service if there's weird medical history in the family. Trust me on this."

Now, if you read the study evaluating the cost of closing the bridge (they showed the numbers at the time of the super poutre and it was abyssimal) it seems obvious to me that the gov is willing to take a chance with the bridge as oppose to basically shut down half of the greater Montreal economy."

I.e. - the pharmaprix near the Oratory used to be some kind of wax museum with a focus on biblical and early colonial era Canadian history.  And there was something called the 'Maison des Nains' up in the Plateau which was also a 'doll hospital'. Way back in the day you'd bring your daughter to go hang out with the dwarves as they repaired your doll... from what I read they basically doubled the space within their duplex by halving each floor... great use of high ceilings.  There's the Gauvin wax museum... I suppose that's weird in a ""isn't it weird this could somehow be profitable"" kind of way...  There's the museum component of the Oratory which is certainly out of the ordinary... also Brother André's chapel...  Holocaust Museum isn't weird, just off the beaten path in that it's out in Cote des Neiges  There's an aviation museum out at John Abbott College in St. Anne's - it has a few old biplanes.  Pointe a Calliere has an underground component that's supposed to open sometime that'll apparently show you the foundations of the old village.  The MMFA has a design wing (at the back of the Hornstein Pavillion) that's unique, but not exactly weird.  And there's a military museum and collection of fighter jets and tanks (etc) out at Longue Pointe military complex, but that's by appointment only.  I'd say spend a day at the Redpath. It's not the biggest or the best, but they do good work, and it's well-rounded as far as natural history museums are concerned.

montreal,3dzfi6,skat0r,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:19 2015 UTC,I suspect because replacement on a road is expected.

montreal,3e0y9k,wolfindian,15,Tue Jul 21 02:53:12 2015 UTC,"Nope.  This is in Hochelag. (They call it HOMA on the listing. That's what the yuppies are trying to rebrand the neighborhood as, to do like SOHO. But it won't stick. Hochelag will be Hochelag for a long time).  Hochelag is up and coming, but it's still incredibly rough. While the condos are sprouting, the area is still populated by the most ""vulnerable"" population the greater Montreal has to offer. There are still crack whores standing on many corners smack in the middle of the afternoon [Edit : In case that wasn't clear, they're not just ""standing"", they're working the corners.]  Don't get me wrong, it's still a lovely place to get to know. But it is in no way the ""Montreal experience"". You are pretty far from downtown, the metro is not too close to the appartment...  I really don't recommend it.  Go in something less flashy, but try to aim for the plateau, downtown or Vieux Montréal. It's gonna be more expensive, but it'll get you the real Montreal experience. Aim for Plateau if you can.  Hoechelag is one of two neighborhood in the entire Island of Montreal where it can be a bit sketchy at night. Otherwise, every part is ultra safe.  Less than 2 weeks ago, there was a blog post linked here about a young mother of 3 who had decided to call it quits after 8 years living there, because of all the syringes, prostitutes, theft and vandalism.   Source: Can't find the address on the listing, but I'm pretty sure these are the loft on Ontario and D'Orléans, above the Dollar Store. If so, I've lived in this building (if not, it's less than 100 yards away, by the description).  Don't hesitate to send me other listings."
montreal,3e0y9k,mambouli,8,Tue Jul 21 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"I'm replying to my own comment because the first one was long enough.  Maybe I've overplayed the sketchiness of it. Hochelag improved a bit since I left, and I did love living there myself.  If I hadn't said anything, you might have never noticed any of that. Cause there is some nice bars and restaurants there now. And it's not that far from downtown. If you plan on driving everywhere, Hochelag's actually pretty neat. But if you plan on walking and taking the metro/bus... don't.  Also, I wouldn't want to imply that Plateau is the end all be all of Montreal. I've never lived there and have never really wanted to. But Plateau in the middle of summer as a tourist is pretty much what's up. If you're into cafes, parks, bakeries and French hipsters; it's your place to be. Lower Outremont / MileEnd also.  If you're more into the flashy restaurants and bars and the clubs; Old Montreal is where it's at. Downtown will be fun too, though I doubt there's too much AirBnB downtown.  Besides that, Montreal's neighborhoods are exploding. The Main is dying, but now you can find great restaurants and bar in :    Villeray & Little Italy Rosemont St-Henri   Hell, even Westmount in the Victoria Village or NDG along Monkland East would be a great stay, though it'd definitely give you more a taste of the rich anglo lifestyle."

montreal,3e0y9k,mambouli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:04 2015 UTC,+1  Old Montreal and Plateau are definitely more tourist friendly areas.
montreal,3e0y9k,neoform,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:31 2015 UTC,"It's not really in the city centre. It's a bit distanced from all the things you'll want to do as a tourist, so as much as people are saying they love it, it's probably because they live there, but it's not a great place to stay as a tourist. I'd suggest looking for something in the plateau, mile end, downtown, or old port (or even better, within walking distance of the metros :: laurier, mont-royal, sherbrooke, berri-uqam, and anything in that lower middle where the orange and green lines run paralel between berri and lionel-groulx). Good luck, I hope you enjoy the town :)!"
montreal,3e0y9k,pkzilla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"It's getting better, but it still has some way to go. You'll find some restaurants and a few ok bars, but no real shopping and not much attractions (except the Parc-Olympique, biodome, jardin botanique).  You should aim on something in Petite-Patrie, Plateau or Downtown, maybe even Villeray.  Even Outremont could be a good choice."
montreal,3e0y9k,NLinMTL,2,Tue Jul 21 07:00:10 2015 UTC,"for a tourist, I'd only recommend Plateau or downtown (includes Old Mtl).  You'd want to see 'Montreal', not the 'burbs.  Little Italy is good for living there, I'd not recommend it for a tourist.  I'll get bored stiff in Outremont or Villeray."
montreal,3e0y9k,mtlpat,2,Tue Jul 21 13:17:38 2015 UTC,"I'd tend to agree with you, but where the Mile/End and Outremont meet (Bernard Street and Parc between bernard and laurier ) is pretty awesome."
montreal,3e0y9k,mambouli,2,Tue Jul 21 13:27:08 2015 UTC,"Really depends what you're looking for, but those are all neighborhood with easy access to the subway or bus to get you downtown and which are fairly nice.  While you won't get much nightlife (although Villeray is getting better), those can still be a decent option to stay in (compared to HoMa, anyway).  They offer a different vibe then what you'd find in the Plateau or downtown."
montreal,3e0y9k,NLinMTL,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:56:23 2015 UTC,"Aime for a place in Little Italy if you can! Great neighbourhood. Lots of restaurants, bars ..etc.. Plateau is a good second choice. Then Point St-Charles. (Proximity to downtown, good prices)"

My wife would never, ever live there.  It's awesome in the sense that it's still true and authentic to what it's been, even if gentrification is slowly doing its thing.  It's awesome because it's a cheap place to live and it's close to downtown.  But it's not awesome for tourism. If you've never been to Montreal and will only stay between 3-7 days, stay in the Plateau or Outremont/MileEnd or in Old Montreal. While these places might be a little ""played out"" to you, they are awesome and truly convey the big charms of Montreal when it's your first time here."

montreal,3e07yw,Prof_G,0,Mon Jul 20 23:50:32 2015 UTC,"I couldn't imagine. Are you kidding? What measurement? I went to the Berkeley Botanical garden and it was amazing. I feel like the collection in the greenhouses in Montreal are extremely static and they haven't added much for the last 5 years. They also put some store-bought Euphorbia milii from a garden center in a few months ago (but strangely removed it after).  Other ones that I prefer would be Brooklyn, and the San Francisco one was good too."
montreal,3e07yw,curiouscuriousmtl,3,Tue Jul 21 00:34:17 2015 UTC,"Well you gotta like plants.  The greenhouses are fabulous - probably 10-15 mins each if you're a bit curious- you're looking at about 45 mins there. Some of these might not interest you - the tropical one or the desertic one attract different people so shave off some time if that's the case.  The chinese and japanese gardens are nice (to me the main interest was the bonsai garden, very enjoyable if you're into that thing.) Then the outside has some semi-interesting gardens, arboriginal focus, tree focus. Your mileage may vary.  I would say that it's a great visit if you bring your own lunch and plan to hang around about 3 hrs and eat al fresco."
montreal,3e07yw,bebidoo,2,Mon Jul 20 23:28:27 2015 UTC,"^ I'd second this.. I love the Botanical Gardens, but you do need a good few hours there to see everything and enjoy it.

If you climb Mont-Royal, you can also continue toward Oratoire St-Joseph and see the University of Montreal campus.  The McGill campus is fairly nice too."

Le producteur ne me l'a pas recommandé; je me suis contenté de faire ce qu'il m'a conseillé et ça m'a bien servi, alors je passe le mot.  Tout de même, avec toutes les stratégies évoquées dans ce post (frigo, huile, conserves...) je viens d'essayer de trouver un peu de science pour m'aider à y voir plus clair. Avis aux intéressés... http://anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu/pdf/7231.pdf (c'est un lien qui apparaît sur la page suivante: http://ucfoodsafety.ucdavis.edu/Linda_J_Harris/).  Je reproduis le passage qui concerne le frigo:   Commercially, garlic is stored near 32°F (0°C). However, most home refrigerators are too warm for ideal long-term storage of garlic. Instead, store it in a cool, dry, well-ventilated place in well-ventilated containers such as mesh bags. Storage life is 3 to 5 months under cool (60°F/16°C), dry, dark conditions.   Franchement, je n'y connais rien; à priori, ça a l'air un peu contradictoire (le frigo est trop ""chaud"" pour la conservation à long terme, mais à 16 degrés Celsius, ça va pour 3 à 5 mois...). Une interprétation possible serait qu'en l'absence d'une température assez froide (0 degrés), mieux vaudrait privilégier un endroit bien ventilé (en plus d'être frais et sec). L'intérieur du frigo est certainement frais, mais j'ignore à quel point il est sec ou ventilé. Ça dépend peut-être des modèles, de ce qu'il y a dedans, etc.  En même temps, le texte date de 1997; qui sait ce que la fine pointe, en 2015, pense de ce qui se faisait au siècle dernier, en matière de conservation d'ail.  Sur ce, je page /u/bebidoo, qui sera peut-être intéressé(e) par le lien."

montreal,3dwghr,mid_west,2,Mon Jul 20 15:59:27 2015 UTC,I can somewhat answer this. I worked with VIA rail on some real estate projects and had a discussion with some management casually over a beer about the cost of TGV. It would have been $15-20B to acquire the land and build the track for a tgv between montreal and toronto. The fares would never justify 1/10th the cost.   TGV's work in Europe because everything is closer together so the ridership/mile of track is a vastly higher ration. It's simply never going to exist in North america because of the price of the land needed to lay new track.
montreal,3dwghr,AngloQuebecois,2,Mon Jul 20 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"Here is a link to the 2009 study about High Speed rail between Quebec-Windsor.  http://www.highspeedrailcanada.com/p/all-canadian-hsr-studies.html  True that the cost is between 15-20$B.

montreal,3dwghr,NLemay,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:44 2015 UTC,I'm not sure; I'm just relaying a conversation I had. However the point of what I was told is that it's not worth laying any track between any two stations in canada by a huge margin. It's just not in the ballpark of feasible.
montreal,3dwghr,AngloQuebecois,2,Mon Jul 20 22:22:42 2015 UTC,"it's not worth laying any track between any two stations in canada by a huge margin   Not worth in the sense of profitability. But we can't think this way, as since WWII, the society decided we would invest public money in transportation. Do we ask to roads to be profitable? Even with taxes on gas, they are clearly not. Samething for airports which have been built with public money.  We shouln't decide to invest or not on highspeed rail only on the profitability point of view. Right now, we rely so much on a car-only sheme of transport, and this cost us much more money.  Edit : Just a side note to show my last point. Federal governement will spend a quarter of the highspeed rail project only on a single bridge in Montreal."

Un problème lorsque ce genre de projets voit le jour en banlieue est qu'ils sont souvent faits dans des secteurs n'offrant pas les services de base.

montreal,3du80a,Cherubyx,13,Sun Jul 19 14:56:32 2015 UTC,"I've never had any problems in NDG. The bus from Vendome runs regularly, and at night there's one that'll take you all the way from downtown after the metro shuts down. 2 or 3 vagrants around, but they're harmless from what I've seen so far. Lots of apartments around here too, and the little side streets are fairly nice and quiet. Plenty of amenities in walking distance. Good luck in your search!"
montreal,3du80a,calette,20,Sun Jul 19 15:07:05 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a woman, the weirdos don't congregate in any one area of town. I've been harassed in Old Montréal, Westmont, NDG, VSL, Plateau. Doesn't matter the time of day either. One insane guy attacked me at 4pm on the corner of Greene and St. Catherine. So my only advice is to always be aware of your surroundings, never walk in any part of town late at night alone (spring for a taxi, it's worth the money). If you have to take a bus, live along the bus route. You can ask the driver to let you off right at your door after dark. It's part of their service, and they've always been accommodating when I've asked. EDIT.  I don't mean to frighten you, because Montréal is safe relative to other cities around the world. But we have to take our own precautions everywhere we are."

I have three girl friends over in CDN near queen mary that have never had any problems in their years living there.

I don't know if they still offer that service, but I found it helpful in decision making. The police would give me info on breaking, muggings, etcetera. Even including the apartment building I was considering. So - you might find that more helpful than polling a dozen people. It's a fairer insight into the community.

There is no such thing as Downtown East-Side in here.  Of course, some areas are poorer than others, but are they more dangerous? I would really not bet on this. And all areas have scary stories, it's pretty much normal over time (it is still a city).  If you want to feel safe, take a appartment with safe feature : not on the ground, shared door with intercom, etc.  If this is not enought : Quebec City is super-mega-safe!

(In my understanding these are 2 things you want to avoid travelling frequently alone at night).    But I will echo that I have never felt unsafe in the area.

I lived in HoMa for two years and am very glad I don't have to walk from the Joliette metro down to st cats east anymore. THAT is a sketchy and sometimes sad zone.  I like where we are in Ville Marie (barely) and the closest metro is Prefontaine. It's very francophone, which I prefer to the anglophone neighbourhoods (can't say why, feels more like my scene even though my french isn't great). I do not however enjoy walking to prefontaine at night.. the area right around Prefontaine/Frontenac/Joliette and even Papineau at times is just kinda sketch at night. I still lived through it with little more than a few creepy super-fast walks, though.  I still would discourage walking alone at night pretty much anywhere unless you are on a well-lit, busy major street and don't need to duck down dark ones to get to your place. I'm right on Sherbrooke which is perfect (except the apartment is noisy) - I have no qualms walking all the way from downtown to home because Sherbrooke feels safe to me.  I have, however, felt sketched out even in the middle of the day in busy, well-lit areas. Sketch bags gonna sketch, I guess.. just pick somewhere close to a bus or metro and might as well just say it: avoid HoMa if you're worried about feeling safe particularly at night."

I have, however, felt sketched out even in the middle of the day in busy, well-lit areas.""  wrt HOMA north of St Catherine:   I suspect this is a case of somebody who is rather sensitive..... it is also a case of perceptions of culture.  This area is working class French.  If this were an English area with same socio-economics status, then it is probably sketchy.  But with it being French, the people might dress and look the same sketchy, but when it comes down to human interactions it is not.  They are much more sympa and friendly than English much further up on socio-economic scale.  Many people of both sexes walk around by themselves any time of day or night with no problem. I have an arab friend, definitely higher up on socio-economic status back in Morocco, who lives in this prefontaine/joliette area with wife and 3 young children, two of them girls.  Even he told me that this area is super-safe and that anybody can get around anytime day or night. HOMA is probably one of the last cheap area in mtl where 2 bedrooms can be easily rented for <$800/mo.  Tons of grocery shops, grocery stores, and dépanneurs around.  Get close to metro stations, and you can even get anywhere fast.   New condos are springing up fast. ""I have, however, felt sketched out even in the middle of the day in busy, well-lit areas.""  - that area should be fine too. The only areas I'd really keep my guard up are parts of St. Michel and parts of Montreal North.   Suggest you trust your instincts and go around the areas that you are interested in."
montreal,3du80a,EmTeeEl,-2,Mon Jul 20 07:51:54 2015 UTC,"You're just making assumptions about my character.   The reason I felt sketched out in HoMa was all of the drug addled humans wandering around at night (and in the day). The needles/condoms on the street, the screams in the middle of the night in alleyways near our apartment. The people collapsed in puddles of their own vomit in the morning on the sidewalk. The people ringing the doorbell over and over again in the wee hours of the morning. Men pulling up in cars thinking I was a prostitute while I waited for the 34.   It's just not the nicest place to live, especially right on st cats. Some of the side streets aren't bad, but you end up walking around some pretty sketchy areas on the way to the metro and bus service in a lot of areas isn't very frequent.   And when I said I've felt sketched out in the middle of the day - I was referring to a few incidents which I didn't detail. One of which was a gentleman coming up behind me while I was on the swings near Place Des Arts and he kept touching my lower back and would not leave me alone after I asked him several times. He was clearly drunk and on some kind of drug. So, felt sketched out, and NO ONE in the area offered me any assistance of any kind I just had to try to get away from him. Luckily, easy enough due to his being super wasted. So.. still felt creeped out.  Yes, families do live around that area in HoMa, and no, it had less than zero to do with the french aspect that made me feel creeped out.  Don't make assumptions about people just because you want to pretend that everywhere is a safe and magical wonderland where women never feel unsafe."

It is one of the first Hackerspaces in Canada; along with Hacklab.to and VHS (Vancouver Hacker Space) all created with a couple of weeks after the conference The Last HOPE.  Since then the scene has expanded and we've seen various Fablabs/Makerspaces open in the city (Echo Fab, Helios, iMusé's Fablab Inc.). While opinions differ and definitions are not set in stone, the two differ slightly in that Hackerspaces tend to be more community/members oriented and subversive, while the other tends to run more like coworking spaces. It's a complex topic that is the subject of many discussions. You can read about it more in this dissertation: Peer Production of Open Hardware: Unfinished Artefacts and Architectures in the Hackerspaces (specially the section titled 'Shared machine shops compared to hackerspaces').  With all that said come chat with us on IRC; or have a very geeky chat, or to play some go/chess, on Tuesday nights for the open house!"

montreal,3dvcqv,denpanosekai,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"Here's an example of the last time this system was used about two months ago.  I didn't know they were using this alert system for simple thunderstorms too. It might be too much. A tornado is fine but even then,  last time it was repeated multiple times in regions that were not really affected and scared/angered people for nothing. They should reserve this kind of shit for big events.  I have the impression there's a geek meteorologist that is excited to launch the alert system each time some bad weather is coming."

The tone at the beginning is standardized so that emergency radios with alert features can automatically turn on when there's an alert.  There's a graph of the French one here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_population_warning#Canada

There's also Deville Diner bar which is a sit down place which has really cool choices on the menu.   There's an indoor mini putt also called Putting Edge.

Pizza - Amelia's if you want thick comfort style, and bring your own wine. There's Foyer in St.Henri that has a really nice atmosphere and great wooden stove style pizza,they also do tartars (was just there tonight), slightly fancier (there's also Rasoi across the street, which is modern indian and also nice. There's Ludger a bit further down for a hipstery vibe, decent cocktails and I had a great buttery lobster roll there, and good oysters.)  Old Port area -  Mangiafoco is also a nice pizza place. There's Atelier Argentine if you want to go a bit fancy and meat, plates in the 20$ range. Stash Cafe is this super cozy cute polish place, old stone interior, and usually a piano player too, and inexpensive. Brasserie T is slightly fancy too, french food, I like eating on the terrace at lunch and people watching as it's right on Places Des Arts. Downtown - Balsamm Inn and Dominion Square Tavern (I prefer Balsamm), they're side by side, and have a really old school 20's-40'2 vibe about them. Balsamm also makes these great flat breads on the spot in the middle of the resto. Kinka izakaya is you want japanese izakaya food, can be a bit loud though, food is great though. For more cozy home japanese food you can try Furusato over near Place Des Arts as well. Atti does great korean food, and it looks a little fancy as well but is fairly inexpensive.   Don't expect too much of the underground city, it's just connected malls and food courts.

You can search online and find a map/trajectory.    There is a facebook post/event somewhere about free activities in Montreal for the summer.  You can take a look at it, and while most of it is not very interesting, you might find something in your taste.     Maybe you can catch a movie at Fantasia if it's in your taste and the weather stays crappy.  As for food, Old Montreal in general is pretty expensive.  Close by, your cheapest option would be Chinatown.  Some decent options in quartier Latin/Berri station."

We also rented a boat from H20 Adventures, picked up food from the nearby Atwater Market, and had ourselves a little floating picnic. The food from Atwater and the boat rental from H20 were both very affordable, and just drifting/relaxing out on the water after days of walking around was really nice. Hope you enjoy your stay :)"

If you swing a right, you'll be heading further up in to the Plateau. You'll know you're going to right way if you're NOT heading down hill.  Lots of niche restaurants and Cafes here, but it gets better if you walk up to Duluth. Take a left here, and continue walking up hill. On the corner of Duluth and Rue Bullion is one of my favorite restaurants, Arepera. The specialise Venezuelan sandwiches made out of a corn based flour. Youll have some vegetarian options, beef or chicken too. I highly doubt you'd be able to spend more than 60$ without being stupid stuffed. When you're done, keep walking up Duluth! Youre not done yet. Take a left on Saint Laurant, and walk down hill. Lots of cool shops, I bet you can find a neat place or too, or even some vintage shops.  You've got two options from here. Walk all the way down to St. Catherine, or, take a left on Rue Prince Arthur, continue through the park, and your back at Sherbrook Metro!  For shits and giggles, do the same thing the next day, but in reverse, and grab a bite somewhere else to eat.  I'm not 100% certain where it is, but there's a little whole in the way Soft Serve Ice Cream shop that will dip it into your choice of flavors and toppings. I feel like its on Roy, between Saint Laurent and St. Denis.  Since its summer, stat hydrated. I don't live around there, so I know its alot of walking, but man is it worth it."

montreal,3dij18,cmroche,10,Thu Jul 16 16:28:18 2015 UTC,I think the argument goes that attaching a horse to a carriage and forcing it to walk through road conditions (and in this case hazards) is the mistreatment. Slipping doesn't have to be intended for the point to be valid.  Edit: Grammar
montreal,3dij18,ProposMontreal,4,Thu Jul 16 16:32:34 2015 UTC,"My answer is not PETA friendly and is based sollely on my opinion which I'm willing to change with the right arguments.   But horses have been pulling carriages for hundreds of year in Montreal and thousands of years around the world. The roads here have not always been paved and have been in bad shape for really ever. I don't see what makes this a ""banning the horses"" situation.   I see a horse that slipped, that's all. Weather they are mistreated in their stables, that's a whole different story and can be solved a lot more easily than banning the horses."
montreal,3dij18,Wolf99,18,Thu Jul 16 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"As several ppl in the comments section on the article point out, horses wore rubber non-slipping shoes in the 19th and early 20th c when they were regularly used in cities, but they cost alot more and caleche driver are apparently too cheap to use them. Well, fuck that. You don't cut corners with animals. Owning animals, nevermind to earn money off them, is a privilege, not a right. If they can't even get the horseshoes right, what's going on in the stables?"

montreal,3dij18,delawana,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:18:35 2015 UTC,"It's obvious that people are cutting corners with the poor horses, their hooves are split and they look so unhappy! I've worked with and ridden horses for quite a few years and just want to help them all. I would even take care of their stables/groom them for free, I love horses, but I can't figure out how I could go about volunteering somewhere.  That said, outright banning is a little extreme. Tighter regulations and regular inspection would probably do a lot more for the situation of the horses than anything else, because horses really are quite happy to pull things. The horses currently just need a rest and time to recover, as well as proper grooming and medical attention. These things are not being provided currently, but they could be if they were enforced."
montreal,3dij18,mancin,3,Fri Jul 17 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"The argument is that we should not be using these slick road covers made of steel, maybe make them less slippery?  Like attach a strip of grip material to it?"
montreal,3dij18,mtled,2,Thu Jul 16 18:01:40 2015 UTC,A large rubber carpet thrown over ought to be sufficient. Only really required on the routes the horses use and can be rolled up and stored rather easily.
montreal,3dij18,hyene,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:47:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. My bike wheels slip on metal slabs like this, as do my shoes. The road cover is a problem, if they make bikes slide sideways I imagine cars must be similarly affected, especially when the surface is wet. They shouldn't be using slick road covers.   And, perhaps, may have something to do with a shitty caleche driver and caretaker. I support transport by horse in the city, but I have also seen many horses with rotting or chipped hooves, a condition often caused by being kept locked in a barn standing in their own feces all winter. If their hooves are in bad condition it is very likely they're being neglected. Sadly, while the caleche driving itself isn't much of an issue, the horses are not very well treated here in Montreal, generally speaking."

montreal,3dij18,delawana,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:35:16 2015 UTC,"Horses aren't livestock in the same sense though, we don't really eat them here. Horses are slaughtered here because we don't know what else to do with them, not because we need them for anything.  A large number of the horses slaughtered every year are racehorses who were lamed and thus can never race again. They're totally fine for casual use, but nobody needs that many horses so they just get killed instead. It's just a waste."
montreal,3dij18,iqaluit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"Horses are slaughtered here because we don't know what else to do with them   I'm sorry but do you happen to have any source on that? I honestly have a hard time believing that it's in any way economically viable to purposefully breed, raise, medically care for, feed, house, train, etc... 61,000 extra horses per year and then do nothing but slaughter them just because ""we don't know what to do with them"".  Horses have tons of uses other than being used as racehorses, including being used as food (contrary to what you said people do eat horse here, it's sold in almost every single grocery store and butcher shop) so if they really had thousands of extra, useless horses around each year I'd think it would be cheaper to do something else with them or at least sell off the meat rather than wasting all that time and money."
montreal,3dij18,delawana,2,Fri Jul 17 21:58:46 2015 UTC,"Here's an article, and here's another and here's another.   People do raise and train so many extra horses because horses go lame so easily. It only takes one injury for a racehorse to become worthless, to the point that it's more economically viable to kill it rather than feed it.  They do sell off the meat of the slaughtered racehorses - another huge concern. This issue is brought up by the first article, which is why it's a bit of a risk to eat horse meat in North America. It's likely safe, but many of the horses were not raised to be meat. The use of Phenylbutazone, a carcinogenic drug regularly given to horses, is particularly worrying. While Canada tests its horse meat regularly, it only tests for residue of the drug while the EU does not allow any horse who has been administered the drug to be used as food. This is because it is unknown what a safe level of residue is, as it says in the ESFA document linked. When I said that we don't treat horses like usual livestock for consumption, what I mean is that we do not have as many dedicated horse meat farms like we do with cows, etc."
montreal,3dij18,iqaluit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:59:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed answer, very interesting and insightful.  One thing I noted was that while these articles talk about horse slaughter as being a waste, they're all written in countries that don't typically consume horse meat. The horse consumption here seems to roughly coincide with the number of slaughtered horses so I don't think horse slaughter here is as wasteful (whether the testing done on the meat is adequate or not is a whole other debate). And even if some of the meat and other horse by-product does get wasted, I feel like slaughtering a lame horse isn't that much different than putting a dog or cat down because of substantial health issues."

This kid is a complete scumbag murdering prick, bread from an unstable, irresponsible, and incompetent family.  I grew up on the same street as he did but was closer in age to his second oldest sister. At the age of roughly 5, he terrorized and bullied his niece (who was no more than 2 years younger than him) and would expose himself to other children playing in the school across the street.   Nothing about this person has ever been stable.   His parents were not involved whatsoever and drew nothing but trouble into the household.   That older sister I mentioned, she would break into neighbouring homes and steal what should could get her hands on for her fix.

Do you go into an office or shopping mall daily with the assumption that no one is going to murder you? Do you assume your partner would never, say, go into a jealous rage and do something completely out of character? (These are just examples.)  It's one thing to say that she was obviously with someone who was unstable, but to suggest she had anyway of knowing this would be the outcome is in a different category altogether. Sometimes people do things unexpectedly, things that no one sees coming.

But that was before shrinks got involved.  Now, especially if one has done some heinous crime, like the Alberta bus beheading, one is 'CNR', ala not responsible.      surprisingly one IS generally 'bornknowing'  I call it 'les enfants surdoues'.  Try to pull the wool over a small toddler, neah impossible!  They sense bad, they pull away.  They could not care less what you tell them, what words you use to tell it with.  Try to do that to adults, especially those who think they can out think all with their logic, 'tranch de gateau'.  All depends on how the child has been raised.   BTW, one day, if you walk by a preschool by the name of Les Enfants Surdoues, that will be my preschool.

If I want to get things out of you, I'd allow you to get close to me cause I can manipulate you easy with the way you think.  In cases like this kind of relationships, in general, neither party really goes into it with full 'connaissance', they don't have control over what they are doing.    as such, disasters happen.  Your terminologies of victim/aggressor is hardly sufficient of getting to first base in the search of solutions.  I would say in general, this is the case for a whole lot of things - people have much much less control over how they act and how they think than what they think they have.  If you want to go deeper into this, go read up on Kochanski's article back in 1994*? years before your 'logic' kicks in, at 20 months, competent mothers are already able to get responsive (socio-emotioanl sense, not social sense) behavior out of their toddlers.

It makes the survivors feel stupid. It does not help other women not get murdered.  Because in the Reddit-addled brain, men deserve second chances, right? Sure, the guy did some things, but he didn't murder anyone before. And he was the father of the children. She had no reason to suspect that she would have been murdered.

Not as smart as you who can foresee these things in your infinite experience.  So you know what? Fuck you and the horse you rode in. Fuck your ""PC"" terminology and fuck your attitude. Someone got murdered, and read my lips IT IS NOT HER FAULT. She did what she thought she should do with her life, with her kids, with her partner. She did the best she could.

But In general, at age 10 you really don't need a big name, you just need good coaching.  What that means is organizations with trained coaches that follow standards based models. In Canada this is formalized under the ""Long Term Player Development"" Initiative.  It's a focus on developing technique and skill as opposed to strength and skill speed.  What you want is anyone who focuses most of their time on focused training and small sided matches (not 11 vs 11 on a full field). Kids need as much time on the ball as possible and especially 1v2, 2v3 type training to learn the skills they will need as a professional.

montreal,3desic,112w3e4,9,Wed Jul 15 18:50:32 2015 UTC,"The data in the barcode is cryptographically signed with a private key - when Revenu Quebec wants to verify the receipt, they just scan the barcode and verify the signature using the public key.

montreal,3desic,LeFromageQc,2,Wed Jul 15 23:52:06 2015 UTC,"Yes. Here is a relevant paper.  The funny characters are a fingerprint (in computer science terms, a one-way hash) of the transaction data. By checking them, one can prove that nothing about the transaction has been altered. I have no idea what the hash algorithm is, or how the result is encoded by the characters."
montreal,3desic,_dismal_scientist,2,Wed Jul 15 21:01:23 2015 UTC,"It's actually in the paper you linked...   In addition to ensure the integrity of the information presented on the receipt, the solution designed by Revenu Québec ensures that the bar-code scanned by the [handheld] reader is produced by the certificate delivered by [Revenu Québec] to the specific MEV [SRM] which generates this signature. The signature is produced by a combination of SHA-256 and ECC-224.  This method uses a certificate which includes a public and a private key issued for each MEV [SRM] with information that identifies the MEV [SRM] and the restaurant.  We choose the elliptic curve algorithm (ECC) to reduce the length of the result (to be converted to a barcode) and to maintain a good strength."

montreal,3ddhod,kl_dv2,5,Wed Jul 15 13:22:48 2015 UTC,"Good list. Another good thing to know if you're on a tight budget is that the property tax is based on the city's evaluation, which comes around every few years. If you're in an 'up and coming' area than you should anticipate paying more the next time your place is evaluated. In my case I bought a condo in Pointe-Saint-Charles which was evaluated at 250,000$ in 2012. When the '2013-16' evaluation was made the property value was set to 320,000$. Hence the property tax is 800$ or so higher per year than I had anticipated. Not a biggie but something to keep in mind."

montreal,3ddhod,coljung,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:33:47 2015 UTC,"If you have an existing mortgage and you sell your condo before the end of your term you will have to pay a penalty. If I remember correctly the fee amounts the interest you would have paid until the end of your term so it can be a biggie.   However, if you take your new mortgage with the same bank, they might just transfer to the new property and you'll negotiate a new loan at the end of the original term.   I've also had friends who managed to get a new bank to pay his penalty in order to get his business but don't count on that.  Pretty sure they got 'fine printed' into adding the penalty amount to their new loan. Paying interest on interest."
montreal,3ddhod,justPM,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:59:02 2015 UTC,So then the safest bet would be to sell as close to the end of term as possible ?
montreal,3ddhod,coljung,2,Wed Jul 15 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"I thought so too but thankfully that's not at all the case. I had 95,000$/19 years left on a 100,000$/20 year mortgage when I sold my condo. Fees will vary depending on your mortgage agreement, but in my case the penalty was a mere 400$, which is far below the amount of interest I would have paid over a 20 year period.   Definitely inquire about the penalty before agreeing to any mortgage. On my first transaction I wasn't even fully aware about the penalty terms, so I was kind of fortunate it wasn't higher."

In other words, you want the condo fees to be in the sweet zone of not too expensive yet expensive enough to cover any major repairs.  -You will want to get home insurance for your condo and personal belongings.

Downpayment Property and school tax adjustment to current owners Condo fee adjustment to current owners Notary (legal) fees Possibly fuel adjustment (if not electric heat) Home inspection fees (not required, but recommended)   You will need to have insurance (maybe not if a Condo), and transfer all leases on appliances to your name before signing the act of sale--which usually means making the first payment on or near that date.  Welcome Tax comes about 30 days after the purchase, you should have this money ready at the time you purchase, or know for a fact that you will have it within 30 days.

montreal,3ddhod,rillettes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:20:40 2015 UTC,"for every mortgage you have you need to pay for a ""quittance"" when you sell, which is 6-700$ per mortgage.  if you have one mortgage only it's fine. if you were part of any kind of program like Access Condo where the city gives you money for downpayment, that's registered as a second mortgage and you have to pay quittance twice.  when you sell you need to provide a certificate of localization for your specific unit. the builder may not have given you one at all, or maybe just a general one for the entire building. so you need an arpenteur and that's another 1000$ or so.

In addition, evidence suggests that cities and metro areas that have invested heavily in sports stadiums and arenas have, on average, experienced slower income growth than those that have not.  Why, then, would cities engage in such activities? This question is actually harder to answer than the former one because, more often than not, the reasons cited are not quantifiable. In other words, the reasons are not as easily measured as, say, costs, because they include many intangible variables, such as civic pride and political self-interest. Moreover, cities generally justify these decisions—and convince taxpayers of their virtue—with analyses that many economists consider suspect because the studies generally overlook some basic economic realities.  [...]  Very little evidence exists to suggest that sporting events are better at attracting tourism dollars to a city than other activities. More often than not, tourists who attend a baseball or hockey game, for example, are in town on business or are visiting family and would have spent the money on another activity if the sports outlet were not available.5"

In June 2001, the Missouri state government signed a contract with the team, proposing a ballpark in downtown St. Louis, but a subsequent funding bill was struck down in May 2002, leaving the saga open.    So they went back to the drawing board in 02.   Team owners sought a location near Madison, Illinois, adjacent to Gateway International Raceway, until the city of St. Louis drafted a financing plan for the team to construct the new stadium in downtown St. Louis.    new plan.   The stadium was financed through private bonds, bank loans, a long-term loan from St. Louis County, and money from the team owners. The development, including the Ballpark Village was projected to cost approximately $665 million with the stadium alone costing $365 million.   And some fun facts about the stadium: http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/stl/ballpark/ballpark_financing.jsp   While the Cardinals covered nearly 90 percent of the costs of the entire project with private funds, the City provided relief from a local admissions tax on tickets, while the state helped with public infrastructure costs to clear and prepare the site for development."

It's encouraging that the Rays get a 90k audience on tv but I wouldnt expect tv ratings to be particularly high over here given that there's just not a whole lot of summer to go around."
montreal,3d99x5,_not_reasonable_,2,Wed Jul 15 02:04:03 2015 UTC,"That's a poll of 500 people asked if they would like to see baseball back.   still a size-able percentage and a decent sample size for a single city. Polling data for the whole province is usually around 1200 people for a sample size (e.g. those are the sample sizes used Leger or CROP).    Baseball can be ruthless in small markets   Yet in a smaller market than Montreal, baseball is thriving in places like St Louis or even Detroit (almost identical in terms of size. 4 million people each. similar salary types around 40k. similar temperatures, etc.) Detroit is in the top 15 teams in MLB in terms of profitability. Or Pittsburgh. population of 2.3 million. the pirates made 220 million in revenue last year.    It's encouraging that the Rays get a 90k audience on tv but I wouldnt expect tv ratings to be particularly high over here given that there's just not a whole lot of summer to go around.   TSN and RDS need something to fill their schedules once hockey ends. the occasional soccer or football game is a few times per week. 162 regular season games. wooh! roughly 486 hours of content with advertising breaks. its perfect for cable rights and web streaming. Cable rights for that for the entire eastern part of Canada would be valued in the hundreds of millions especially since everyone likes not rooting for Toronto in this country.   You're argument to me is like someone saying, ""whats the point of having a metal concerts here? only like 15% of Montrealers like metal. It'll never take off. Even if a bunch of people want to raise some money to build their own concert venue then I am dead against that. They can't have that because I don't like metal. only 15% after-all like metal. so, no metal in Montreal."""

The cigarette manufacturers will often have temporary price reductions on certain brands (and even sometimes only certain products like king size 20s specifically.) You need to ask the clerk what the cheapest is, usually Pall Mall or Philip Morris.  In general the prices in a certain neighborhood will be very similar- the big chains set the prices pretty low and the small depanneurs in the area (that pay significantly more for the same product) are forced to lower their profit margin to compete. So it's usually not worth driving around looking for the best price.  If you have the cash to buy by the carton (8 packs of 25), Tigre Geant is by far the cheapest."

It can be bad if you need it quiet, though...  I don't think I've seen a real quiet neighborhood. Some streets are quiet, but one person can ruin it all. Neighborhoods where there are a lot of old people tend to be quieter in my experience. Of course, if you live in the same building, you might have the occasional hard of hearing tenant who listens to Deal or no Deal at full blast, but otherwise, there are definitely fewer block parties, motorbike races, dance competitions, fist fights, street hockey games, etc. in those neighborhoods."

montreal,3dd2kt,Maxbladex,4,Wed Jul 15 09:29:46 2015 UTC,Landlord asked for post dated cheques and a key deposit.. Apartment had old furniture in it and trash in the back... Anything else?  If not you have no legal basis to cancel a lease without paying the remaining months on it.
montreal,3dd2kt,Maxbladex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:57:15 2015 UTC,"throughout the year a lot of things about the house broke, heating didn't work most of the winter, the door was broken (literally came off its hinges) for 2 days so we had to put a couch over the frame to try to block the cold from the winter. I  know the post dated cheques and key deposit seem like petty things, but they are illegal things of the landlord to ask from the tenant, and its illegal for me to stop paying rent so i just want to know where my rights stand :) Thank you for you're reply :)"
montreal,3dd2kt,jonahlew,2,Wed Jul 15 10:02:13 2015 UTC,There are only a few cases where you can legally break a lease according to the provincial rental board:   a tenant is allocated a dwelling in lowrental housing (aka social housing) a tenant can no longer occupy his dwelling because of a handicap an elderly person is admitted permanently to a residential and long-term care centre or to a foster home   And that's it.
montreal,3dd2kt,DFTricks,2,Wed Jul 15 12:35:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, giving him the post dated cheques & key deposit are your fault. Call the bank and cancel the cheques. Ask for your key deposit back. Simple.  Your best chance for cancelling the lease was during the time when you had no heat and no door.  CALL THE REGIE.  (But you are probably shit out of luck.)"
montreal,3dd2kt,YULorama,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:13:21 2015 UTC,"Call the Régie and bring them your future checks. You must contact the Régie du logement if you want to get out of the contract.   But for the moment you must take back what is rightfully yours. Make a list of the days that you had no heating, broken doors, and calculate the cost of electricity per day with your HQ receipt during theses months. Take it out the total of your next month rent, have a text with the calculations and copy of your HQ receipt when handing it over to the Régie.  Call the bank to cancel the checks and let your landlord know that you brought the payments to the Régie. If you don't tell him, you could get in more trouble.  You can also charge him for cleaning up the apartment since it was filthy and filled when you arrived.  Even if you find a sublet, you might be fighting in courts for months, good luck!"
montreal,3dd2kt,throwaway9f5z,5,Wed Jul 15 23:30:22 2015 UTC,"FYI, I am the landlord of a triplex and asking for postdated cheques IS NOT illegal. A landlord can always ask but they cannot make postdated cheques mandatory though.  So this will be hard for you to prove that it wasn't a agreement you made with your landlord when you signed the lease (it is written on the lease -at least in the new version- in the payment section that you can pay with postdated cheques).  As for the key deposit, that is indeed illegal.  Your best bet would be to find someone else to rent the apartment so you can transfer the lease."

You are not on the judge or jury and thus need to be impartial.   This case will not be about guilt or innocence, it will be about degree of murder and whether he is in for life or just 25 years.   For there to be presumption of innocence, there must be doubt. When there is no doubt, you can go right ahead and draw your conclusions."
montreal,3dat3g,Prof_G,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"(just to clarify, I'm a cop so law is something I know)  the presumption of innocence has nothing to do with doubt. when we speak of reasonable doubt, it is in the context of a conviction, not the process. the presumption of innocence is a concept in law that presumes that the person is being accused, and until a judgment has ben rendered, they are considered innocent.   It is guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights under section 11 d) and the Criminal Code of Canada under section 6 (1)(a)  Now in this case, although the initial facts that came out logically point to the accused having committed a crime, I reserve judgement until all such facts are out. Let me give you an example: What if a jealous best friend killed her and he knew where he put her? We have no indication that he acted alone (if in fact he did do it). What if she was hit by a vehicle causing her dismemberment?   Until we get ALL the facts, we don't know for sure what/how it happened. There are lots of things we (including myself) don't know about this case that haven't been released. Did he do it? Looks like it, but we still don't know exactly what happened, and who did it. All we know is that he is somehow involved."

montreal,3d9tl9,iqaluit,5,Tue Jul 14 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"I went to the EconoFitness in Ville-Marie and it's a nice gym, you just need to know how to do your workout yourself. Get in, do your thing, leave and it's the best and cheapest gym available.   There are no trainers, you just show up and work out. There is not a ton of equipment for strength training (I think they want to attract mainly a clientele of cardio bunnies because 50% of the gym is dedicated to treadmills and bikes) but there should at least be one of each thing. You are free to go in there, ask the clerk at the counter to just go in and look at what is available in terms of equipment because you're still deciding (the employees couldn't care less, I'm sure they're all paid minimum wage)   My experience has been great. It's sometimes crowded, but I've never had to deal with someone being rude. Ask politely if you can work in with someone else if there's only one machine and you want to use it. I went there mostly to do barbell strength training (squats, bench, deadlifts, rows) and there was just the right amount of equipment for me to do complete my workouts.   Edit : Also, I've seen a lot of people using machines incorrectly and doing plain stupid/dangerous things. Really, the employees don't care, they're 16 yrs old kids looking for an easy job where they can basically sit on their ass all day. Just make sure that this kind of gym is right for you, you need to educate yourself on how the machines work and how not to injure yourself, because no one will be there to watch over you."

I asked a few questions to the front desk, and didn't get answers, so there is that lack of ""professional"" trainer, however the gym is a very friendly environment where people working out are usually willing to answer your questions and help out!  It's a very basic plan. 10$ a month, straight up gym. The hours are regular hours; the equipment is recycled (from what I've heard) from Energie Cardio, but works perfectly; you have to pay for showers or massage chairs; etc. Very straightforward and great business model if you ask me.  Nothing absurd in the terms, however if you want to cancel before 12 months, there is an additional fee, which seems pretty normal.  Good luck!"

I used to really like IPAs for the crisp taste, but the craft stuff is undrinkable.  Like iqaluit said, there should be other light options.

But without question, stouts/porters are never hoppy. Dark beers being hoppy, and weird, cloying flavours like ""honey brown"" (yeeech!) or ""dark lager"" are relatively new things.  The British Isles are the experts on dark beers, and I don't just mean Guinness. Fuller's line of beers, Smithwick's, Newcastle Brown Ale, Kilkenny, McEwan's etc etc - that's a wide range of ales, and none are hoppy. This overly hoppy swill is a bunch of Yankees and Canucks making beer with the same dominant taste and acrid aftertaste no matter what they're style making. Don't get me wrong, the explosion of craft beer has been great overall (fuck Coors, Bud, Pabst, etc) and there's alot of excellent stuff being made, but like any trend it's attracted noobs who don't know what the fuck they're doing."

Je vais tout de même te laisser sur deux citations que je trouve pertinentes:   Nobody has the right to not be offended. That right doesn't exist in any declaration I have ever read.  If you are offended it is your problem, and frankly lots of things offend lots of people.  -Salman Rushdie   et   It's now very common to hear people say, 'I'm rather offended by that.' As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what.  -Stephen Fry"
montreal,3d6prn,hellshogun,9,Tue Jul 14 01:18:03 2015 UTC,"This is how I'd argue if the government tried to ban people from wearing headdresses in public.  That's not what's happening here.

""I'm offended"" doesn't mean ""you have to stop doing that"" when said on it's own. It's just ""hey, if you want me to like you then maybe you won't say/do things that bother me."" If you don't care about those things then fair play. Let's also not forget that Fry is, in that quote, professing being offended by people saying they're offended.

Ça fait que c'est une parodie ou un satire (au moins un peu) approfondi.  L'utilisation des symboles autochtones, cependant, ne se fait généralement que pour des buts esthétiques dont la signification religieuse est mal comprise - ou pas comprise du tout - par ceux qui le font.  Un jour, peut-être, les symboles autochtones seront sur le même niveau que ceux chrétiens, et rendu là, on pourra revoir notre position.  Aussi, il faut dire, le christianisme a un passé de prosélytisme actif, imposant sa vision aux autres.  C'est pas mal plus ""fair game"" de lui faire un juste retour."

Would you not wear a crown in a festival for something british? or in britain?   On the other hand, it is a sort of ""official"" or culturally significant piece of clothing which has meaning that would be diluted and disrespect some people for wearing it.   It's a bit weird to me. It's kind of not right to me, to prevent people from wearing whatever they want, but on the other hand, I don't really care, would never intend to wear that anyway, and I think anybody whose asked nicely not to wear one because it is sort of insulting or offensive to some people, then ok.   It's not like it is a sort of standard piece of clothing. It's like if viking hats were disallowed or something, because there were still groups of vikings that held importance in them and doing that is insulting for them.

But as one human being to another, if you ask me not to wear one because of what it means to you, I don't mind complying with that.  You know, how many radical Muslims we need living here before we comply with how women dress, like in Iran? You know? They would say the same, that it is offensive, but I don't care.

There is so much racial tension between white people and First Nations in Canada, especially the west.

There are countless social and health crises plaguing First Nations communities that many Canadians don't even know about let alone care about.    But a few white people want to take Molly and dance to music and have a wicked cultural experience for a weekend, so they dress up in a costume they don't bother to try to understand from a culture they normally don't give two shits about.

Considering the last one had a difficult time finding its footing and stumbled real hard, would imagine this one will be plagued by similar problems.   Forgot to mention: a lot of the public service contracts are up in the fall but considering how the public service is viewed at the moment after their tantrum in the Spring, its going to be an uphill battle for them as well. Which is a shame. There are a lot of dedicated public servants who are going to get screwed on some of the austerity policies and thats never easy on them or their families."

That doesn't address a civil service that was designed to work in 1976 when its 2015. reduce the civil service by 12%, close redundant departments that exist on the federal level and kick the saving back into the province, use remaining government revenue saved from reduced salary payouts to invest in infrastructure developments around the province. pay down the debt to have better positioning for 2020 when a third of the province retires and leaves the labour force. Thats the sort of solution support. it offsets austerity by direct investment into the province."
montreal,3d7m8a,Wolf99,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not intimately familiar with this proposal, however the impression I have is that it's not a simple 'tax-more-improve-social-programs' model. That being said, I may be wrong.  I think the issue comes down to this: what is austerity and why is it necessary when the upper-classes have been receiving more and more wealth/profit since the implementation of neoliberal economics forty years ago? One argument is that austerity/neoliberalism is not an economic necessity but rather the reestablishment of upper-class power (see David Harvey). It's about transferring wealth from the lower- and middle- to the upper-class. In a world where recession reigns yet corporations are sitting on massive piles of cash, why must social programs be cut? Could some of this wealth not be invested to help people in need and strengthen our communities?"

I've really never had any problems with drivers except for just one single time, where a driver took a detour to go jam himself in the only traffic he could find (St-Laurent club traffic at midnight). I didn't pay him in full.  Otherwise, my experience has been ranging from completely uneventful to very pleasant.  I've never had a driver refuse to turn off the radio, something I've asked pretty much all the time.  As for mode of payment, which seems to be the n1 complaint Reddit users have, well ... I was a bartender and always, always paid in cash and tipped appropriately.  Should taxis be annoyed that you want to use a card to pay? No, of course not. But I do ""get"" the annoyance. I'm pretty sure they're the ones who have to absorb the merchant fees charged by the card companies. Losing 3-5% of the sale (sale, not profit!) or $0.50-$1.00 would annoy me too."

I would say the only inconvenience that being an anglophone has caused me is the embarrassment I get from not speaking French. You can do everything speaking English only but I personally think it's just not right that I can't speak even some basic French when a little conversation happens. Specially when I see the Quebecois learning a little English. That's why I think it's essential to know a little French. At least for proper cultural immersion and integration, if not for daily convenience. Might just be me, but that's how I feel."

I'll understand you in English."", or something of that sort. So then I feel like I'm annoying them by trying.   I find people in customer service will be extra patient and slow it down. The worst is when you try, and then the person you're speaking with starts rapidly explaining something and you have no clue because it's so fast. Ordering a coffee or getting groceries typically doesn't allow this to happen. The convo is too limited, and the employees are used to it.  It's a lot easier to understand people on the island. Some of the dialects on the mainland are super intense.  I guess this is why I'm trying to learn more this summer!   Living here has improved my French though, even if slowly. I can understand my boyfriend's Italian family more when they're speaking Italian. So I guess that will be my next challenge after French."

In my middle school, we didn't have DR and MRS VANDERTRAMP - but we did learn songs to help us remember- so the verbs that conjugate with être, we learned to the tune of ""Hi Ho"" from the seven dwarfs. We also learned to conjugate ""avoir"" using the Mexican Hat Dance, ""faire"" to the tune of ""if you're happy and you know it clap your hands"" and ""être"" to ""Row Row Row your boat"".

So it's hard to say what the life of a ""typical"" anglo might be.  (And that's always been the case.)  As for myself, I work entirely in English but I speak French in public and make a point of reading books/newspapers and watching movies/television in French. I don't think about it much, but if I weren't fluent in French I'd say my life in Montreal would be pretty impoverished.  I have some colleagues from the United States who can barely speak any French and they tend to be fairly ghettoized (their only friends are fellow Americans and other expats). One of them described her life in Montreal as feeling like this.  What do I think about other language minorities? I support them completely. My family is from New Brunswick, so I have a lot of sympathy for the Acadians. I also used to have a girlfriend who was Franco-Ontarian, so I appreciate how hard it is for that community to retain their culture.

My boyfriend is francophone and we speak franglais at home, but more english than french (his school is also in french but his work is in english and he's never gotten used to speaking to me in french even after three years.) Right now I'm only working on my thesis so I don't have classes, so the only time I definitely speak french is once a month during meetings with my advisors.  My daily life right now is wake up, check the internet (english), watch netflix (usually english), go to yoga (mostly english, some classes are bilingual). In the evenings my boyfriend is home and we go to the gym to workout with a trainer (franglais), hang out with friends (english) or hang out together (franglais but more english).  In the fall, my life will be similar except three days a week I'll have class (two classes are in french, the third is in english) and the group projects, readings, and research that go along with that. I'm seeking permission to write my thesis in english because most of the existing research is in english, I want to publish a subset of the results so having things in english will make that easier, and I can show it to more potential employers.  It's hard to learn french in Montreal because everyone replies to you in english when they hear your accent. This means you only need to speak french sometimes (or not at all.) If I were in Quebec or really anywhere outside of Montreal, I'd have to speak french all the time.  I'm not sure what you mean by Quebec english words? Like ""terrasse"" and stuff? I understand some Quebec french expressions but if you go full joual I'll miss the details of what you're saying (I had a prof like that, his class was hard.)  I don't really have any major thoughts about other language minorities.  I never really took french classes except two writing classes at Concordia.

My kids go to French daycare, and my oldest is entering French immersion kindergarten at the local English elementary (I want my kids to get their certification of English instruction so they can have the choice for their kids as well - and I want them to learn both languages well). My kids will be prepared for life whether they stay or go; I hope they stay. They'll have a huge advantage over the kids who only learn one or the other.   When my wife and I travel outside Quebec we will use French when we want to talk privately in public.   Watch hockey, TLMEP, some news in French. Majority of entertainment is English.

Des situations de même, entre 15:00 et 18:00 c'est à toutes les minutes où le monde s'envoie chier en continue et le monde essaie de couper. Une fois par mois environs t'as des policiers qui se mettent sur le bord et donnent un ticket à tous ceux qui coupent. ça fait du bien de les voir aller, parcq qu'au même endroit, il y a une traverse pour piétons et quand le feu tourne au vert, certains se dépêchent pour couper 4 voies pour se mettre en travers le premier. j'vois des piétons traverser quand c'est leur tour et passer à 2 doigts d'se faire frapper au moins une fois par semaine. Ça, c'est sans compter ceux qui passent ensuite sur la rouge pour aller se ranger dans la troisième voie et couper jusqu'à celle de gauche. Tout ça pour dire que cette intersection est vraiment hyper dangeureuse, pis j'ai du mal à m'imaginer c'que la ville peut faire de plus que c'qui y a déjà (caméra de feux rouges, présence policière régulière)"

There's a reason you're not allowed to cross on a solid line, it's dangerous, you have to stop in the middle of a busy road with relatively high speed traffic (Décarie) and then merge (actually cut) in front of people trying to get on the highway with an unsafe distance.  It's an incredibly selfish thing to do, it puts his and other people's safety in danger and creates traffic for everyone waiting behind him.

This is what road rage guy is attempting to do.   However!! That bit of the service road provides inadequate options and whichever method of merging will cause additional traffic."

montreal,3d585e,foxfire,0,Mon Jul 13 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"Zipper merging is always the best. If we go in single line, we're only as fast as the slowest person in the line. That is simple operation management theory.  Simple example, if a person takes time to move in traffic, the lag is transferred to the person behind him. You can guess that in a long line, that lag transfers all the way to the back while adding each lag point an individual driver may generate to the point that the person at the end might actually have to do a complete stop even if the person at the head is going at a reasonable speed.  Real life example: decarie circle comes to a crawl going 40 east in the fast lane in rush hour by the simple reason that you have to cut your speed by half when you get on the 15 south. The person behind the the first driver has to decelerate just as much or even more ( if he was going faster than the first driver), and then it simply keeps going.  Personally, you're only a douche if you cut illegally purposefully, and i find the dash cam driver to be the initial ass."

Sometimes all 3-4 lanes are jammed up because cars from all directions try to get through the entrance. I can understand the frustration of having a car cut in at the very last moment.  I work nearby and it's a hot mess every friggin' day."

SO many people would use the bus lane to speed forward into the clusterfuck that happens when 6 lanes turn into 3 to go up that bridge. Then going onto Decarie was a whole other mess but it wasn't ever nearly as bad.

montreal,3d50hf,slapyomomma13,8,Mon Jul 13 16:00:45 2015 UTC,"Howdy there!  I went last year for both days as VIP, but I received free tickets from a sponsor. The difference is minimal to be honest.    The bathroom situation isn't that relevant. All bathrooms are overall the same in terms of cleanliness and the lines are usually not long for the public bathrooms. Unless you're planning on drinking A LOT, then the bar won't make a difference either. Usually, it's easier to drink before entering these types of events (maybe sneak in alcohol if you feel gutsy) and coast through the drunk. There is plenty of room to relax. The VIP area actually is probably more crowded than the rest of the island the show is on. VIP is not packed, but there is someone at least 3-4 feet away.  The view isn't better from VIP. You will probably want to huddle into the crowd, and if not, then you can stand behind the crowd and still get a decent look.    Overall, I wouldn't pay the extra 60$ for the VIP experience, but you do bump into a couple local DJs/celebrities in the VIP (ie. Paris & Simo, Domeno). Personally, I think general admission is great for Ile Soniq with a bit of preperation!   If you want more tips/answers, feel free to ask."

Apparently, a cat's fur protects as much from the heat than from the cold, and shaving them is actually unhealthy. Or so they say.  My cat also has long hair but my flat remains cool even during summer, so it's not much of an issue BUT her fur tends to get matted too, and if you're interested in getting tips on how to deal with that rather than shaving your cat's fur, I'd be happy to oblige."
montreal,3d2sj6,Aparty,3,Mon Jul 13 09:29:21 2015 UTC,"I used to shave my cat once or twice a year because he would get badly matted and hated to be brushed.  Matts are painful and cause stress to them, and stress is the leading cause of UTI's in cats.    My vet recommended we keep our cat shaved because of it.  He was much more comfortable and happy with a lion cut and once I started doing it myself at home (after years of helping groomers and gaining experience) he really enjoyed the process.  It was easier for him to not have to leave the house.    If it's an indoor cat who isn't exposed to the hot direct sun or sharp temperature drops and extremes it's fine."
montreal,3d2sj6,bebidoo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:34:15 2015 UTC,Can you talk about how you shave your cat yourself? My cat is a really anxious rescue and it would probably help if it was done at home.

I wouldn't recommend doing it at home unless you've had a class or practice helping a groomer.  My cat was very anxious at the groomer too, so she always had me help.  After 10 years I felt confident enough to do it at home with my son (the cat whisperer) holding the cat and me with the clippers.    Do not do it yourself."

montreal,3cz900,faizimam,12,Sun Jul 12 04:28:26 2015 UTC,"One big aspect of the new interchange is that most of it is ground level, so it will never really ""start crumbling"". It's more of a standard highway interchange now, with only a few overpasses that need checking.  Regardless, burying a highway only really makes sense if the surrounding area has value. The thing with this one is that they made it 30% higher capacity than the old one, resulting in a larger size, this despite the fact that most statistics show a plateau or even decline in total vehicle kilometers traveled. If that continues to be the case in a few decades I imagine we are more likely to simply reduce the size of the interchange than bury it."

If you're looking to share a place with someone you can get some crazy cheap rents compared to back home. Also a lot of the time you'll be subletting, so you won't be locked into a 12 month lease.

I recommend getting 2 jackets, one that is more water proof which will go down to about -5 or -10 then get a big jacket that will get you down to -40. Also really good boots are also important."
montreal,3czs8v,auxym,2,Sun Jul 12 11:36:31 2015 UTC,Roughy how much would a -10 and -40 jacket cost?  Also could you guess how much a one bedroom or studio would cost to heat during winter?
montreal,3czs8v,quebecistanais,10,Sun Jul 12 11:45:27 2015 UTC,"Eh, foreigners spending crazy money on ultra-warm winter coats & canada goose shit make me laugh. My winter jacket is Levis and cost me 40$ at sears. On closeout, but still, don't shell over 100$ or so.   Dress in layers instead, like put a wool or fleece jacket/sweater on under your coat if it's real cold and you'll actually be spending more than 10 mins outside. Get a decent hat, mittens and boots (sorels are cheap, ugly, warm, waterproof and classic). My protip: thermal long undies make waiting for a bus in jeans on a cold day much more pleasant. 20$ max for an ok pair.  Check out winner's for cheap-ish stuff (canadian equivalent to tj maxx). Or thrift stores if you're real poor. Simon's is expensive in-season (reg prices) but end-of-season deals are good."
montreal,3czs8v,whidzee,4,Sun Jul 12 20:19:43 2015 UTC,"IMO a dedicated winter coat for -40 is mostly useful if you plan on standing/sitting outside for extended periods during winter months (e.g. waiting in line to get into a club, waiting for a bus during night service in a residential area), and you want to remain stylish all over. Of course if you plan on going downhill skiing, hunting, or winter camping further north, you might get more mileage out of a down jacket, but otherwise, especially if you're on a tight budget, I think your money is better spent elsewhere.  Layering is less expensive and more flexible. I get by with a long sleeve shirt, a polar fleece jacket and a wind breaker. On the coldest days, I add long johns and warmer socks underneath.  What makes some winter days particularly brutal is the wind. Cover your ears and your neck, and wear gloves (mittens are better).  Unless you have a very complicated hairdo, with lots of gel and what not, and need a fur lined hood to survive without messing up your style, I recommend a balaclava. Seriously. I don't see a lot of people wearing them (I suppose they're worried they'll be mistaken for bank robbers), but they're awesome. They're polyvalent; you can wear one like a regular hat, but it can cover your ears, your neck, and your face if need be.  A lot of people (especially teenagers) wear running shoes all year long. I don't recommend it; at least get some galoshes so your feet don't get wet and your shoes don't get all crusty with salt. There are some deep puddles on street corners.  As /u/auxym recommended, Winners is cheap and good. I also recommend l'Équipeur (aka www.marks.ca).  Have fun."

See if Concordia has a ""Housing"" Facebook page where other students are looking for subletters, otherwise you can go for craigslist, or your uni might also have it's own housing page.

montreal,3czs8v,commissar_lubi,2,Sun Jul 12 07:23:40 2015 UTC,"Well, my experience was that Montreal had lots quite a lot of housing available for fairly cheap when compared to Australian cities and our crazy-ass rent prices.

People looking to sublet will sometimes even let you pay less rent than what they normally pay a week and just cover the difference themselves if they're desperate."

montreal,3czs8v,cicistarkiller,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:13:28 2015 UTC,Can you suggest areas I should be looking? Is it safe to that any suburb on a train line will be somewhat gentrified and/or safe? If I can help it I'd like to avoid high crime areas.
montreal,3czs8v,i_ate_god,2,Tue Jul 14 07:28:43 2015 UTC,"The metro isn't a train line in the way you're thinking - the areas aren't suburbs, they're different parts of the city. (There's an actual train line - the AMT - that connects the suburbs but I lived here five years before ever taking it.) The majority of the city is clustered around metro stops and everywhere is pretty safe. For Concordia, I'd recommend staying along the green line, the orange line within one or two stops of the transfer stations, or along Sherbrooke (the 105 bus takes you straight to school). Particularly convenient stations include: Villa Maria, Vendome, anywhere on the green line from Verdun to Papineau, and the section of the orange line from Sherbrooke to Rosemont (watch out with Rosemont, though, because a lot of places are fairly far from the metro and you need to take a bus.)  There aren't really any high crime areas in the city. There's nowhere I've found where I wouldn't feel comfortable walking alone at night, for example. Some areas are slightly sketchier than others (HoMa, some parts of Verdun, some parts of CDN) but I wouldn't warn you off living in any of those places."
montreal,3czs8v,i_ate_god,2,Tue Jul 14 15:15:45 2015 UTC,"I will suggest Côte-des-neiges: a very nice area with lots of students with lots of restaurants, approx. 20-30min of bus from Concordia.  If you're looking for a more anglo area, perhaps take a look at NDG"

montreal,3czs8v,EnderW1gg1n,2,Sun Jul 12 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"As a student you'll probably get a student email for concordia, use that and look at facebook groups for housing for Concordia, there is one for McGill as well, but I'm unsure whether or not you'll be able to use the Concordia email for it.  Rest assured, if you lower your standards and want to find a temp place, there will be landlords available. Near Concordia your best bet is apartments, if you choose to branch out you'll find cheaper housing in atwater areas and even further in vendome, both of which are on the western side of concordia. Towards the east, there's the mcgill student ghetto, and further pass St.Laurent street housing prices drops also."
montreal,3czs8v,e1itist,2,Sun Jul 12 23:35:21 2015 UTC,"Hey!  I would definitely suggest looking on Craigslist for rooms/shared or sublet/temporary. You may have your mind set on living alone (and yes, rent is cheap enough here to live alone), but winters here can be incredibly isolating. The greatest thing about living with like-minded (or completely dissonant) roommates (especially in winter) is that everyone gets together over mulled wine to work on their craft - and you have the opportunity to meet interesting characters who make their way through.   I'd suggest looking in the Mile-End (that's where I live) and the Plateau. They have a) tons of amenities b)well connected via metro and bus-routes and c) are packed with loads of creatives and d) you can get by with minimal french. Most of the venues you'll be visiting (if you like to go to shows or vernissages) will be in these areas or, Petit Patrie or Hochelaga (which is just starting to peak interest, but are incredibly francophone areas).   Anyway, if you have more questions, shoot me a message! If I see anyone looking for a new room mate, I'll send the info your way."

montreal,3czs8v,BurtKocain,2,Mon Jul 13 07:38:09 2015 UTC,"For a variety of reasons, it will be much easier for you to go the roommate route.  For starters, short term leases are not that common. Secondly, almost all 12 month leases expire on June 30th, so availability afterwards is not great.  Kijiji, Craigslist, Padmapper are good choices, and Concordia will probably have tools at your disposal to find roommates.  In terms of neighborhoods, base it on metro access:  For the orange line look at places near Vendome, Place St. Henri, Lionel Groulx, Berri Uqam, Sherebrooke, Mont Royal, Laurier  On the green line look at places near De L'Eglise, Lasalle, Charlevoix, Lionel Groulx, Atwater, Guy-Condordia, Peel, McGill, Place des Arts, St. Laurent, Berri Uqam, Beaudry, Papineau."

Règlements manifestement volés d'ici / rules blatantly stolen from here : https://manhuntmontreal.wordpress.com/about/  RÈGLEMENTS :   Tous les participants doivent porter UN BRASSARD sur le bras droit (apportez le vôtre si possible). Ceci est pour différencier les joueurs des passants innocents. Si vous harcelez les piétons, c'est une DISQUALIFICATION AUTOMATIQUE. (Même s'ils le méritent.) On vous donne deux minutes pour se cacher, soit en arrière des poubelles, dans les arbres, ou dans la fontaine du carré St. Louis en utilisant l'équipement de plongée de mononc Robert. Il y a un chasseur désigné. C'est sa job de vous attraper. Quand inévitablement le chasseur vous attrape, vous devenez aussi un chasseur. Après trente minutes, tout le monde doit revenir au point de départ. Vous pouvez rester caché plus longue si vous voulez, mais après trente minutes, personne va vous chercher. Important : Si vous sortez de la zone designée pour n'importe quelle raison, vous devenez un chasseur. RESTEZ DANS LES LIMITES. C'est interdit de rentrer dans les magasins, restos, cafés, ou tout autre lieu. Ceci est un évenement extérieur, et se cacher à l'intérieur n'est pas seulement déshonorable, ça va aussi déranger les commerçants (nous n'avons pas besoin d'une deuxième équipe de chasseurs contre nous!) Les gagnants (ceux qui n'ont pas été attrapés) peuvent se pavaner comme James Bond ou Carmen Sandiego. Les complets et les manteaux rouges sont permis, même encouragés. Les règles sont très simples. Si vous voulez faire toutes sortes de plans avec d'autres chasseurs ou chassés, c'est à vous (mais est-ce que vous pouvez leur faire confiance ?) C'est un jeu de compétence, d'athlétisme, et d'honneur.   RULES:   All players must wear a highly visible ARMBAND their right arm (bring your own if possible). This is so that you don’t confuse players with pedestrians. Attacking pedestrians is an automatic OUT of the game. (Even though we may slap you on the back later. That’s your own business.) Everybody is given two minutes to hide, be it behind garbage dumps, in the trees or inside the Square St. Louis’ fountain with your brother Jimmy’s scuba gear. There is a chosen hunter – it is his or her job to find your sorry ass. Once he or she grabs onto your sorry ass – firmly, but not sexually (it is important that it is not sexual, that is a completely different game) – you become one of the hunters. You can hide for a total of 30 minutes. After that everyone must return to the rendezvous point. Important: Should you be chased or run out of the designated area, you become one of the hunters! STAY INSIDE. Going inside stores, restaurants, cafes or any area that is not within the public sector is prohibited. This is an outdoor event, and not only is hiding inside like a mangy dog completely dishonorable, it will also have a number of shop owners playing their own game of ‘catch those armbanded infidels!’ The winners are allowed to strut as if they were James Bond or Nancy Drew. Suits and patterned dresses are allowed.The rules are fairly simple. It’s not rocket science. If you want to strategize with other hunters or huntees it is up to you.

It's insanely nerve wracking, and that just makes things worse. Montreal is really really awful in that context. Apart from restaurants where you have to sneak in or buy something, there's barely any public washrooms. If you're out past 11 it gets even harder. Every public space so have bathrooms open late at night. It shouldn't even be up to bussineses to decide. They just shouldn't be allowed to refuse access.  In France when I was there, there are outdoor ones that you pay like 50 cents to get in and they self wash. But that might be asking for too much already. Even Toronto has made it so establishments can't do the 'bathrooms for customers only' thing too."
montreal,3ct65h,pkzilla,18,Fri Jul 10 16:18:41 2015 UTC,"There was a time when public bathrooms were one of the focus of the city in Montreal, most if not all public parks near the centre had well maintained public bathrooms (the famous Camilliennes). But in the 60s, our reactionnary conservative mayor Jean Drapeau saw public gathering as something suspect, the first step towards disorder, deviance and rebellion as this blog wrote so well and made efforts to render public spaces unsuitable for long stays and loitering. Such efforts included mowing down all the schrubs and small trees of Mount Royal.  The need for more public bathrooms is just not for the ederly, disabled or people suffering from a condition, it's also needed because more people use the public parks for longer stays more than ever. Parc Jeanne Mance on Tam-Tams days comes to mind."

Especially if I could see you were just a kid walking by who really needed to go. Sad to say, this did not include those who had no alternative to public washrooms, the homeless. High chance they wanted the space for something illegal, but even if they didn't, they would leave the place disgusting (and I had no time to clean it during my shift). Those without their own property do not respect others' property. Also, if I refused them something, they were extremely abusive to me - the most abusive people I met in that job.

If the city wanted to kick in a few extra bucks an hour for the folks making minimum wage to do it, then maybe.  But until then, go check out a downtown McDonald's bathroom at 4 o'clock in the morning.    The city collects taxes from everyone, business owners included, and you're literally asking them to put up with everyone's shit.  And we would all be walking around with sore red cornholes because we'd never pay for toilet paper again because we don't need to buy it - we can shit anywhere we like for free - and every business is only going to buy the cheapest giant rolls of 80-grit sandpaper for toiletpaper.  Maybe you and I should open a bathroom business together.  Like a video arcade but for pooping.

But for those who don't have a garage it's really handy and I believe they should have the right to put one up. It's their property, they pay Saint Lambert's ridiculous taxes on the property, they should be allowed to have a little convenience.   And why the fuck are you lumping together tempos and watering driveways? The two are in no way connected- you're just putting two things you don't like together as if there's some sort of conglomerated group of people you don't like that are all the same. Life isn't that simple.  Yes watering driveways is stupid. I've seen my fair share of that in Saint Lambert too so don't be all too high and mighty."

montreal,3ctdcy,neoform,5,Mon Jul 13 13:09:34 2015 UTC,"there is something else I don't get:   In a decision rendered in court on Friday, a judge said that while residents of St-Lambert surely were exposed to loud noises, the sounds emanating from the festival site on Île-Ste-Hélène don't break the 80-decibel noise limit.    So the limit for noise (presumably during a certain time frame), is 80dB.   St-Lambert submitted the affidavits of 16 people who complained the noise was too loud, even though the noise levels were measured at 20 decibels below the limit.   So St. Lambert gets noise at 60dB and they feel that this is too loud.   The plaintiff also requested the noise limit be reduced to 60 decibels.   So they want the limit to be equal to what they are taking Evenko to court for? This article is probably poorly worded."

If it were flat from the road to the backyard it would be fine but in my yard in particular there is no land on my property that is wide enough to get the bins to the backyard on their wheels. It's all dome shaped nonsense.

montreal,3co4ph,CeBlanc,6,Thu Jul 9 15:29:31 2015 UTC,"Je vis dans Mercier (la partie plus aisée d'Hochelaga si on veut...) depuis 1997, donc presque 20 ans, et j'ai remarqué que la gentrification à amené une hausse des problèmes.  Bien sûr il y a les problèmes mineurs comme le fait que les espaces de stationnements sont de plus en plus rare (en partie à cause du fait que maudit, les gens savent plus comment se stationner en prenant UNE SEULE place) ou le fait qu'on retrouve de plus en plus de déchets dans les rues. Mais il y aussi des problèmes plus graves, comme une augmentation du nombre de vols, une augmentation du vandalisme, du nombre de personnes adultes avec des problèmes mentaux (du genre, des personnes qui gueulent toutes seules à 2h de l'après-midi), une augmentation du  nombre de sans-abri même, chose que je ne voyais jamais à l'est de Pie-IX avant.  Dans un sens, je blâme tout ça sur la gentrification, autant celle de HoMa que celle de Mercier. Celle de HoMa pousse les personnes plus pauvres vers l'est, encore plus loin du centre-ville. Ces personnes arrivent donc dans Mercier. Il y aussi la gentrification de Mercier qui est à l'origine des problèmes; des jeunes professionnels s'installent dans des condos neufs, mais ils sont jeunes, ont de l'argent et souvent ils arrivent de la banlieue donc ils se croient tout permis. De plus en plus, on assiste à des bagarres, des chicanes, des partys qui finissent le lendemain midi en semaine...   Les vols et le vandalisme sont en hausse aussi; parfois on sort de chez nous pour retrouver toutes les vitres en morceaux, tout les miroirs de voitures au sol, tout les toits renfoncés... Parfois ce sont des plates-bande qui sont détruites, des bornes fontaine ouvertes... L'été passé, on a lancé des oeufs sur ma voiture et sur celle de mon voisin on a déversé sa poubelle.   Quant aux vols... on m'a volé 2 vélos dans ma cours, un voisin s'est fait volé sa moto dans sa cour fermée à clé, un autre s'est fait prendre son gros bac roulant pour le recyclage. On a volé des plantes dans notre parterre (avant de partir avec un pot en ciment un moment donné...), on a retrouvé une voiture volée et abandonnée dans notre entrée de garage un jour.  Mercier, c'est supposé être plus calme qu'HoMa, mais criss, les problèmes d'HoMa débordent dans les quartiers avoisinnants. Je sais que ça '' s'améliore '' là-bas, sauf que pour un problème de réglé, un autre apparait aussitôt. C'est un cercle vicieux et ça commence à s'étendre. Tout ça en grande partie à cause de la gentrification qui pousse les moins nantis à s'éloigner et donc à '' dégrader '' les coins plus tranquilles et à cause des nouveaux venus qui souvent manquent cruellement de civisme et se permettent de faire tout et n'importe quoi en nous répondant qu'en ville, on doit tolérer.  Je m'excuse, mais la tolérance urbaine n'excuse pas le fait que tu t'engueules dans la ruelle avec tes chums jusqu'à 4-5h le matin, ça excuse pas le fait qu'une fois par été tout les vélos se retrouvent chez Comptant.com et surtout, ça n'explique pas pourquoi les problèmes qu'on est supposément en train de régler sont en fait en train de contaminer les secteurs autours.  Ça fait presque 20 ans que je vis ici et jamais mes grand-parents puis mes parents ne se seraient installés ici s'ils avaient su qu'un jour on verrait une pute ou un clochard devant notre porte.   Mercier n'est plus '' la première banlieue dans l'est '' depuis qu'elle est devenue une annexe d'HoMa."

Pourrais-tu me dire quels sont les secteurs troubles du quartier (Mercier-Ouest et Est)? Je compte déménager près des métros Langelier/Radisson/Honoré-Beaugrand et la rue Sherbrooke; trouves-tu que ces environs sont corrects?"
montreal,3co4ph,teadr,2,Fri Jul 10 12:23:27 2015 UTC,"Je suis dans Mercier-Ouest, entre Sherbrooke et Hochelaga pres du metro Cadillac. C'est plus tranquille qu'HoMa et Mercier-Est, mais c'est beaucoup moins calme que ca l'etait. Les prox sont raisonnables par-contre, parce que les logements sont grands et bien entretenus.  A la station Langelier, y a beaucoup de blocs, donc c'est moins cher mais pas necessairement propre ou tranquille. A Radisson y a beaucoup de bungalows mais les auelques appartements sont recents, et c'est le coin le plus tranquille du quartier. Honoré-Beaugrand c'est de l'autre cote de l'autoroute, dans Tétraultville; c'est comme a Langelier mais avec des batiments plus vieux.  Entre Cadillac et Radisson, c'est assez recommandable quand meme, a condition de bien magasiner. A Langelier si tu veux un petit loyer, tu vas etre dans un bloc de 20-25 logements en rangee; le blvd Langelier en est plein entre Marseille et Hochelaga. Tu peux aussi aller en haut de Sherbrooke, ce qu'on appelle le Nouveau-Rosemont. C'est un coin de personnes agees, mais il y a une ecole secondaire de 1500+ eleves. Ca depend si ca te derangerais ou pas.  Le secteur au grand complet est tres frequentable le jour, les debordements arrivent la nuit vers les 1-3h et c'est quand meme pas a tous les jours. J'en ai mis beaucoup dans mon autre reponse, mais c'est des evenements qui se deroulés sur quelques annees depuis le debut de la gentrification. Tu vas mieux dormir ici qu'a HoMa; c'est comparable a Rosemont en fait comme atmosphere."

montreal,3co4ph,DaveyGee16,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:37:59 2015 UTC,"The entire idea you're putting forward is flawed because of one simple fact: Every city has shit areas. They always have and they always will. The only thing you can do with the ~10% of the population who simply can't fit in with society, is live with them and try to help their kids, because most of the adults are too far gone to be changed or saved (depending on how you look at them).   To move to a shit neighbourhood and complain about it being shitty is moronic. Especially considering that the economy has been in the shitter for close to 8 years - being at its worst between 5 and 7 years ago.  It's up to you to research where you're moving to. A neighbourhood that hasn't changed much in 30 years isn't suddenly going to change for you. If you expect that it should, you're simply delusional, and probably need an ego adjustment."

Ontario street is cleaning up a bit with cutesy bars and shops, but the skid row stretch on Moreau reminds me how much people can suck (no pun intended).  To make matter worse, the area is filled with uneducated and unhealthy Quebecois, meaning they've been here for generations.

montreal,3co4ph,dackerdee,6,Thu Jul 9 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some of these people are fucked up. Calling them pathetic is a bit harsh though. It's obviously a place where people go when things aren't going particularly well, due to the cheap rents. And those people raise children who often end up the same way, because they learn from their parents. Social programs are great, but a lot of people don't think to use them because on some level their lifestyle works. There's a lot of mental illness out there too, and those people often are affected by the stigma and shame that comes along with that.  Your argument is a little too close to the classic CBC comment that appears on any story related to First Nations topics, basically that they should just pull themselves up by their bootstraps, get jobs, and all that bullshit. These people generally don't appreciate how shitty the history of that community is. White people literally stole and raped their children, among other things. Yet some people still seem to think that this has no long lasting effects. That someone (and several different cultures) can just forget their fucked-up history and suddenly adapt a healthy lifestyle.   A lot of these people need help and aren't asking for it. They're life works in a way and they feel joy sometimes, that's all some people need and more importantly that's all they know. I doubt there is much hope to reach the fucked-up adults, so I think the best situation is to try to reach the children and teach them good habits while in school. After-school sports programs and community garden spots (unfortunately, there are far too few) are just a couple ways to do that."

There's also this entire fucking directory of services:  http://www.arrondissement.com/mercier_hochelaga_maisonneuve-list-directory/t1/  There are also several services at the provincial/federal level, namely universal health care. There are thousands of people who strive to alleviate the suffering of the less fortunate. These systems and organizations help end the cycle of poverty/addiction/violence/abuse on a daily basis.

No.  Can you look at the clientele who's caught in a spiral of poverty, illiteracy, drug abuse, violence etc and say : well we gave you CEGEPS, DEP and Daycares ... what the fuck are you lazy ass doing?

montreal,3co4o8,NLemay,7,Thu Jul 9 15:44:39 2015 UTC,Il m'est très difficile de comprendre comment une carte avec un numéro unique ne peut être rechargée en ligne avec une carte de crédit. Je pose la question: what year is it?
montreal,3co4o8,bog5000,4,Thu Jul 9 14:46:11 2015 UTC,Il y a des informations sur les titres que tu possède dans la carte et pas seulement dans une base de données centrale.  Ça permet de valider la carte opus sans avoir absolument besoin d'être connecté à un système centrale en temps réel.  Pratique pour les autobus.
montreal,3co4o8,Hugotohell,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:34:09 2015 UTC,Ça permet de valider la carte opus sans avoir absolument besoin d'être connecté à un système centrale   Comment la borne de l'autobus fait pour valider qu'un billet n'a pas déjà été utilisé si la borne n'est pas capable de communiquer avec la centrale? Imaginons un cas où quelqu'un clone une carte opus (pas besoin d'y décrypter l'information).
montreal,3co4o8,clgoh,4,Thu Jul 9 17:40:49 2015 UTC,"Quand tu scans ta carte opus dans un bus, le scanner ne fait pas que lire, il écrit également dans la carte opus que ce billet a été utilisé à telle heure sur telle ligne.  C'est pour cette raison qu'il y a un maximum de titre qui peuvent être détenu en même temps dans une carte opus.  Si c'était tout centralisé dans une seule BD il n'y aurait pas de limite.   Imaginons un cas où quelqu'un clone une carte opus   Si quelqu'un réussissait à le faire il pourrait utiliser la 2e carte dans un autre autobus.  L'erreur serait détecter plus tard lors de la synchronisation des deux autobus au système.  Ce système a des avantages :  1- Permet de valider les passages beaucoup plus rapidement.  Comparer à une transaction parcarte de crédit par exemple (Visa PayWave ou Mastercard PayPass) qui prenne 4-5 secondes à vérifier.  Ça semble peut mais quand 20 personnes attendent à l'arrêt pour embarquer ça devient très long.  2- En cas de panne ou de problème de communication, tout reste fonctionnel et on peut continuer de valider les cartes opus."

Having the fare and transfer information stored directly on the card means that your card can be validated instantly by the reader, even if it's not connected to a central network.   Otherwise, every single STM bus would have needed to be reliably connected to the internet just to process cards. I think it's too much to ask."

La STM est capable d'annuler une carte à distance si l'utilisateur annule sont abonnement ou perd sa carte.   Oui, il y a un système centralisé, mais il n'est pas en temps réel.  Par exemple, si une carte OPUS est annulée par la STM, son numéro va être mise sur la blacklist, ce qui fait qu'instantanément, elle ne pourra plus être rechargée nulle part. Ensuite, à la fin de la journée, quand les autobus rentrent au garage, leur lecteur OPUS est mis à jour avec les numéros blacklistés, pour qu'ils arrêtent d'accepter la ces cartes, et possiblement qu'ils détruisent l'information sur la carte annulée en cas de rencontre."

The contents of the cards are encrypted, the reader/writer passes only encrypted data from the card to the STM servers which then validate and perform all operations. Yes it is hackable, absolutely any device is, but you're going to need to get the encryption keys somehow if you want to read or write usefull data and such types of hacks (and hacked cards) can usually be tracked."

montreal,3co4o8,paillotdechevre,2,Thu Jul 9 17:35:46 2015 UTC,"The benefits of using smart cards include the following: Because private keys are stored on the tamper-resistant smart card rather than on a less secure medium such as the user's hard disk, smart cards provide stronger security for user authentication and nonrepudiation. Because cryptographic operations are isolated from the operating system, smart cards are not susceptible to attacks on the operating system (such as buffer overflow attacks and memory dump attacks,which might reveal private keys or other cryptographic secrets). Because logon credentials accompany the user, you can issue a single smart card to each network user to provide a single set of logon credentials for logging on to local and remote networks, which can reduce the cost of administering separate user accounts for logging on to a network and logging on remotely. In addition, logging on with a smart card provides much stronger security than other types of network logon processes that depend on traditional passwords. Furthermore, because the administrative support that is required to manage user passwords is a significant cost for most large organizations, you can deploy smart cards to reduce the cost of supporting users who forget their passwords or let their passwords expire. Smart cards use personal identification numbers (PINs) rather than passwords. The smart card is protected from misuse by the PIN, which is known only to the smart card's owner. To use the smart card, the user inserts the card in a smart card reader that is attached to a computer and, when prompted, enters the PIN. The smart card can be used only by someone who possesses the smart card and knows the PIN.   https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962052.aspx"

montreal,3clcst,stop-saying-that,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:05:41 2015 UTC,"First off, you didn't read (2) closely enough. It says photos must be removed from all uses, including online, by the end of 2015. Puts a different spin on 'one use', no?  But it seems to me that (3) is the most unreasonable, particularly in light of (2). It grants Swift's team the right to re-use the photos without restrictions for publicity. Oh sure, it says Swift can't use them for 'commercial' purposes, but wtf does that mean? She can't use them on a poster or t-shirt sold in a store? Or maybe she can, since 'promotion' could be interpreted extremely broadly. Anything that gets her name out there is 'promotion' in some sense. She can certainly use it in print, online, or video/tv ads, concert promotion posters, on ticket stubs, news releases, etc. That's promotion. Needless to say, Swift doesn't restrict her team's use to only one use or only the end of the year.  They're extremely restrictive about the media's right to use the photos the media took (2), but give themselves the right to use them essentially without restriction (3). That's bullshit. Swift's people are basically saying the media photographers work for her for free, and the photos are ultimately her property. And all the media get out of the deal is the right to use them once, but only until Dec 31, 2015.  I'm not in the PR/marketing/media biz, but that smells like complete bullshit to me. Hell, I call it theft, plain and simple."

La SAQ vers 1 milliard de dollars en dividendes au Ministère des finances à chaque année. Elle nous offre un des plus grande sélection, sinon la plus grande sélection de vis au monde.  Son réseau permet relativement le même niveau d'accessibilité et surtout les même prix partout au Québec.  Elle paie ses employés un salaire qui leur permet de vivre.  Il n'y a aucune raison de privatiser la SAQ. À moins d'être un des magnats des affaires qui pourraient s'appoprier une part de ces profits; ce qui est le cas d'à peu près personne."

Aussi, si je compare les prix de produits internationaux entre la SAQ et ce que j'ai vu aux USA, les prix de la SAQ sont généralement équivalents ou moins.  Aussi, si une compagnie privée viendrait à prendre le marché, elle n'a aucune raison de baisser les prix parce que la clientèle est déjà habitué de payer un certain montant pour un produit. Pourquoi décider volontairement de réduire sa marge de profit sans raison?  Et pour le très intelligent commentaire qui propose une taxe sur le vin pour aller chercher l'argent que le gouvernement perd en ayant plus la SAQ, bien tu t'assures d'avoir les mêmes prix que la SAQ et peut-être même plus!

Les heures d'ouvertures de la SAQ sont convenables, il suffit de prévoir un peu.  La privatisation n'est pas une solution miracle non plus. Faut être mal pris en maudit pour demander autant de cash à nos sociétés publiques.  L'austérité a ses limites aussi, c'est noble et très bien d'assainir nos dépenses et réduire notre dette. Faut pas virer fou et penser que ça va régler tout nos problèmes. (Voir ce qui se passe en Grèce, l'austérité a peut-être eu un effet positif mais là c'est clairement pas la solution) Pour être prospère, il faut investir sur des bons projets et être innovateur (et arrêter de se faire crosser, aka: pas de corruption).

Un obstacle, prévient-on cependant à Québec, où cette agence a diversifié certaines activités et est responsable, par exemple, de la perception des pensions alimentaires. Depuis des mois, l'économiste Montmarquette poussait pour que cette proposition soit retenue par le comité, bien qu'elle risque d'être taillée en pièces rapidement, tel un recul du Québec, par les adversaires souverainistes du gouvernement.   500 à 700 millions par année, progressivement depuis les années 50 pour un service presque entierement redondant avec celui du fédéral.

montreal,3cjljs,FranzNO3,14,Mon Jul 13 22:56:56 2015 UTC,"Ce monopole est mis en doute toutes les semaines ; il n'y a pas d' « enfin ». Ce qui plus est, si le gouvernement s'est précipité pour répudier les conclusions du premier volet de cette étude, je ne vois pas pourquoi le deuxième serait mieux reçu.   Ouvrir la porte à la concurrence forcerait la société d'État à rabattre ses marges, à baisser ses prix pour faire face à la concurrence. En contrepartie, Québec pourrait majorer ses droits sur les vins et spiritueux: l'effet net serait neutre pour les coffres du gouvernement, mais les clients auraient droit à davantage de produits, selon des horaires plus souples.   Si l'alcool ne deviendrait pas moins cher pour le consommateur puisqu'il serait taxé davantage, pourquoi en discute-t-on ? Le plan est nul. La SAQ ne manque pas de sélection et ses horaires sont plutôt convenables, d'autant plus qu'il y a maintenant plusieurs succursales ouvertes jusqu'à 22h tous les soirs."
montreal,3cjljs,holymadness,17,Wed Jul 8 14:13:04 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ about the selection. With the exception of wine, the SAQ has the worst selection of nearly every other liquor store I've been to in the world. And unless you want to arrange an expensive private import of an entire case of something (for your own personal consumption—cost sharing disallowed), you're not legally allowed to sample what the world has to offer without physically travelling there and bringing it back par valise."
montreal,3cjljs,orangenormal,8,Wed Jul 8 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"With the exception of wine   Well that's a pretty big exception, considering that SAQ offers over 10,000 different wines. More than in pretty much every other market out there.  It's also the preferred alcohol drink of Québécois. It's normal that it there that they focus most of their energy.  As an ex bar owner, I've had my share of grief about their limited liquor selection; but they did step up their game recently. I'll willingly trade off my ability to procure some liquors for the billion dollar the SAQ pays the government every year."
montreal,3cjljs,mambouli,3,Wed Jul 8 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"But why not have the best of both worlds? There are, what, 8 million people in Quebec? Since the SAQ already works with over a hundred import agencies to help arrange private imports for restaurants and bars, then surely I should be able to special order a bottle of something and let the SAQ sell the rest to any of the remaining millions of Quebeckers. Heck, I'd even accept waiting until they get 12 requests to ensure demand for the full case before placing the order. But that's not the situation. Either you personally order an entire case for your own private consumption, or weep softly into your empty cocktail glass."
montreal,3cjljs,orangenormal,5,Wed Jul 8 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"Right. I agree that certain measures about quotas should be revised.  I'd actually love for the SAQ to open a spirit boutique where you can make special orders.  But I don't think that this is good reason to privatize the SAQ. Even in the private world, you'll encounter such thing as minimum order requirements."
montreal,3cjljs,mambouli,3,Wed Jul 8 21:04:57 2015 UTC,"I second that! I was in New jersey last year in some random liquor store. It was huge! Granted the inside of the store looked nothing like the SAQ outlets but it was easily overthrown by the mile long corridors filled with wine,scotch and beer."
montreal,3cjljs,anoutchine,2,Wed Jul 8 16:53:28 2015 UTC,Le manque de sélection est causée par la loi qui interdit toute vente de bière qui n'est pas embouteillée au Québec. L'abolition du monopole ne changerait rien si la loi n'est pas modifiée aussi.

montreal,3cjljs,SuperSoggyCereal,7,Wed Jul 8 19:13:40 2015 UTC,La sélection est convenable? Pour vrai? J'ai bu des vins en importation privé dans des restaurants qui étaient non seulement très bon mais aussi pas mal différent de ce que l'on retrouve à la saq. Tu veux un vin nature? Bonne chance! T'aimes le calvados? La plupart des succursales on une seule marque pas terrible. Quand je vais aux états-unis je suis méga jaloux de leur sélection de scotch. Je ne vais pas commencer sur ce que tu peux trouver dans un kiosque de coin de rue en europe.
montreal,3cjljs,piri_piri_pintade,7,Wed Jul 8 16:25:26 2015 UTC,"Ayant déménagé à Montréal de Paris, je sais très bien ce qui existe en Europe. La plupart de caves à vin françaises sont très petites et leur sélection restreinte. Si tu cherches quelque chose en particulier, tu es obligé de fouiller un peu partout et d'appeler chaque boutique pour connaître l'état de leur stocks. Par contre, les SAQ Sélection ont une énorme sélection et tu peux immédiatement savoir où acheter une bouteille en particulier en se servant du site web ou de l'appli mobile. Donc oui, il y aurait plus de choix dans l'absolu, mais pas dans le voisinage. D'ailleurs, la SAQ vend près de 350 vins bios. Pour info, la plupart des français trouvent cette mode assez ridicule, voire nuisible pour la qualité du vin ; je n'ai jamais vu de vin bio en boutique ou dans un restaurant.  Je suis d'accord qu'il nous manque autant de choix en matière d'alcools forts, mais je suis surpris que tu aurais choisi le whisky pour illustrer ce fait. Je suis un grand amateur de scotchs et beaucoup des meilleurs single malts écossais sont en vente au Québec. Non, ça ne se compare pas au États-Unis, mais ce n'est guère la pénurie et le choix est bien supérieur à ce qu'on trouve en France (où – ironie – l'importation du whisky est contrôlée par un monopole).  Le problème ici c'est surtout le coût. Le reste n'est pas si mal. Une bouteille vendue à 25 $ à la SAQ peut s'acheter pour 10 € en France et encore moins chère aux USA."
montreal,3cjljs,holymadness,3,Wed Jul 8 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"Oui c'est cool de pouvoir faire des recherches avec un outil central, mais je continue de croire que la sélection pourrait être mille fois mieux. On peut toujours pas trouver du Shōchū par exemple, c'est pourtant aussi populaire que le sake au japon.    Btw, vin bio != vin nature, le goût est très différent, c'est une classe à part selon moi.  Y'a quand même pas mal de vin bio à la saq. Des vins natures ils ont commencé à en avoir cette année seulement, et y'a un choix de genre 10 bouteilles."

Which is ok because alcohol is the cause of a series of costs in society (car accidents, health problems, decreased productivity being some) that are being somewhat offset by those taxes (much like tobacco taxes are).  Opening the alcohol market to competition would achieve next to nothing if it's not coupled with tax reductions.  Some big conglomerates could probably grab a share of the market by underpaying employees and sending their profits overseas.    One thing that should be done though is to allow private importations without having to use the SAQ as a import broker, which artificially raise the price.  I'm sure there would be solutions to allow people to do that and still pay their fair share of taxes.  That would be a great solution for restaurants and bars to increase their access to rare spirits/wines."

montreal,3cjljs,chronic_flatulence,8,Wed Jul 8 16:52:47 2015 UTC,"It's bullshit, I know, but it has to do with the federal solution that Canada took to the question of prohibition.   In 1898, Canada had a national referendum on whether to ban the sale and manufacture of alcohol. Quebec voted strongly against it (only 19% of voters supported the policy), whereas other provinces voted in favour of prohibition (especially the Maritimes). But nationally, the resolution only had the support of 51% of the population - which was considered too weak a mandate for a policy that would divide the country along the lines of Protestant/Catholic and French/English.  So instead, prohibitionists turned to the provincial level, securing a ban in PEI and barely failing to do the same in Ontario.  There was a brief national prohibition during WWI, but after the war the federal government did not follow the American example of keeping the ban in place - again, the government did not want to exacerbate interprovincial tensions. So instead, the feds banned interprovincial sales, which allowed certain provinces to remain dry.  With liquor sales firmly under provincial control, provincial governments were free to pursue their own policies - particularly in response to the introduction of national Prohibition in the US after the war.  As a compromise position during this era, a number of provinces (starting with Quebec and BC, where support for prohibition was weakest) decided to hand over the sale and distribution of alcohol to government agencies. The Catholic Church opposed the move, but the policy was attractive to the Taschereau Liberals, not least because it generated millions of dollars of government revenue annually.  Eventually, prohibition faded as a political issue, but provincial governments were unwilling to give up control of liquor sales - for the same reason that any government is reluctant to surrender a source of revenue."
montreal,3cjljs,Gorrest-Fump,2,Wed Jul 8 19:13:52 2015 UTC,"The two largest purchasers of wine in the world are the LCBO and the SAQ. In theory we should see the savings passed on because you should have an economy scale which would reduce the price when you handle mass purchases. In reality we don't have that, at least in comparison with vendors in the states. Granted there is a considerable amount of taxation and import fees levied on wine/spirits but even then that would not [edit:entirely] account for the high price."
montreal,3cjljs,joerussel,5,Wed Jul 8 16:53:24 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, at the SAQ, the retail price of Orval is far below the cost of any US retailer I've asked about it. It's normally sold for >$6 USD per bottle. I haven't figured out if this is because of the economy of scale, or because the SAQ doesn't have half a clue about anything beer related (no, really, we don't need more generic yellow lagers just because they're from somewhere not previously represented by the joke-of-a-beer-section at all SAQs)."
montreal,3cjljs,seancoates,3,Wed Jul 8 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"In reality we don't have that, at least in comparison with vendors in the states.

montreal,3cjljs,Hemiltonne,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"However in practice, it's more that some dude figured out a way to control the foreign alcohol supply of 8 million people, and make competition against this supremacy illegal.  They have absolutely no incentive to pass on the savings.  People can't go someplace else to buy their bottle of rum.  The only limit is when it's so expensive that the customer decides not to buy any rum at all.  All the SAQ needs to do then is set their price somewhere under that limit and they're golden."

Now factor in that the Quebec government generates a certain amount of revenue from that they are not likely to abandon their current model unless they can see a means of increasing or maintaining their revenue rates.  You can argue the cost/benefits of a government being directly involved in the sale of a product that can be viewed as a vice and bad for your health but at its core, its a monopoly that is maintained through legislation."

montreal,3cjljs,Psychedeliciosa,2,Wed Jul 8 19:15:07 2015 UTC,"What you say is partially true.  The SAQ is largely hands-off for beers distributed by a brewery in Quebec (with certain exceptions, like for Brasseurs Illimités).  ""Jean's Dépanneur"" isn't allowed to import Sierra Nevada from California or even Bellwoods from Toronto.  They have to be privately imported through the SAQ, in full cases (for a single purchaser; can't legally split a case of 24 with a friend), through an importer, and they sit in a SAQ import warehouse, being ruined by heat and time (need several months to clear), then the SAQ sets the price and takes an unreasonable profit (unreasonable = $5.50/bottle through the SAQ (and OdGC) instead of $2.15 (at BevMo, adjusted from 1.69 USD) for SNPA)."
montreal,3cjljs,seancoates,2,Wed Jul 8 19:26:31 2015 UTC,I think Jean depanneur have to deal with an autorised distributor the get the beer he want and the saq only take a small administration fee ( I don't think deppaneur's beer got trough SAQ warehouse).

Studies have shown that exposure to sarcasm enhances creative problem solving, for instance. Children understand and use sarcasm by the time they get to kindergarten.

Normally, if traffic is dense enough, nobody gets caught by that camera because everyone slows down to the speed limit. However when traffic is light it's up to you to pay attention for those signs."

montreal,3cm2fz,molecularpoet,2,Thu Jul 9 01:02:07 2015 UTC,"Just FYI some states have reciprocal agreements with Quebec about traffic violations, so that a fine here has repercussions in your home state and possibly your insurance."
montreal,3cm2fz,dpc59,0,Thu Jul 9 04:22:30 2015 UTC,"I believe that the cost for you to defend yourself in court would be more than the fine even if you were in the right (but I'm not a lawyer so I'm not going to start speculating), you got fucked by the government's cash grab fines.  sorry, eh"
montreal,3cm2fz,dpc59,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:44:26 2015 UTC,"I wasn't really planning on taking it to court. I was more wondering what the work zone laws were. I read that their was a case in Manitoba about work zone signs were only applicable with workers present, http://thenewspaper.com/news/26/2684.asp. If that also applied in Quebec, I was going to try calling and explaining my case over the phone. It doesn't hurt to try, but I wanted to be as informed as possible on the situation."

It's raking billions and billions of dollars since they installed it, which is a wonder because everytime I go by there, the traffic crawls nearly to a halt...  It's too bad you did not notice the camera warning signs as well as the speed limit sign right before it...  Oh well.  Urban highways (autoroutes) are limited by law to 70 km/h.  ""Following the traffic"" is not a reason to bust the speed limit."

montreal,3cmpcw,_not_reasonable_,4,Thu Jul 9 03:04:59 2015 UTC,"Why do you even care if the post is on the second page?  What is the big deal?  Why do you care so much if a post has 0 votes?  Not every post is going to appeal to every person here.  Do you even know that reddit has an algorithm in place that fudges the true value of upvotes and down votes?  It's not hard to search or click to see the second page....  Seriously I'm honestly asking why do you even care if a post has 0 votes? Like /u/c0ldfusi0n said above you're not going to change peoples behavior on voting just because you think the post should stay on the first page longer.  I'm not attacking you, just questioning why it bothers you so much.  Is it that hard to click on the second page or ignore post you don't like?  No sarcasm this time, just an honest question..."
montreal,3cmpcw,federalistor,5,Thu Jul 9 03:15:16 2015 UTC,"Internet points matter to a certain point because if your internet points get too low, for some reason, the system believes you're not a good poster.  Therefore it limits how much you can post.    In some subs, you can't post at all if your internet points are too low.  In other subs, the mods must approve your posts before they appear.  All that because your internet points are too low.  It happened to me.  My internet points are so low now that I can't post in another sub and I'm not even sure this one will appear.  I've pretty much given up on the idea that I will participate on the Canadian reddit communities.  It sucks that Internet points matter but they do."
montreal,3cmpcw,FantasticAccident,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:53:47 2015 UTC,"This is really a function of you being new.  Once you get a hundred points or so it wont matter if you make good comments or bad, it will not block you.  This inconvenience is the result of people exploiting new accounts more than than a desire to limit your good conversation.  So don't focus on being popular, just participate in the discussion (take 15 minute breaks form Reddit when you get the red message) in a respectful way and you'll see your new account have the x minute ban in no time.  Source:  This is my new burner account."
montreal,3cmpcw,iqaluit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:01:25 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, if you complain about downvotes on Reddit, that usually attracts even more downvotes, regardless if users liked your comment or not. Nobody likes a whiner, especially when it's over something so trivial as internet points.  I'm telling you this cause you seem new to Reddit and I've seen you complain about downvotes a couple of times over the last few days, all this because a single comment got a handful of downvotes.  The issue isn't the downvotes, it's the age of your account. Once your account is a bit older and you've participated in a meaningful way losing a couple of imaginary points won't matter anymore (heck I've had comments get downvoted in the triple digits and it's never stopped me from commenting)."
montreal,3cmpcw,_not_reasonable_,-1,Thu Jul 9 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"Just create another account.  If you get shadow banned maybe your opinions just aren't well received and you should consider not posting in the sub's you're getting down voted in.  If you keep banging your head against the wall and then complain that it hurts you only have yourself to blame no?  Reddit isn't here to validate every opinion. You have a right to post what you want, but you have no say in how people judge your content, it's just the way reddit works."
montreal,3cmpcw,federalistor,2,Thu Jul 9 11:08:06 2015 UTC,"Creating another account won't help because my Internet points will be at zero and subs will not want me to post because my account is new AND my internet points are too low.  I'm not shadowbanned.  It's just my Internet points are low so the subs believe I'm not a good poster and some of them either don't want me to post or want to approve my posts before they appear.  In my previous post, I said    I've pretty much given up on the idea that I will participate on the Canadian reddit communities.   and you reply   you should consider not posting in the sub's you're getting down voted in.   So that's exactly what I'm doing.  However, as a Canadian, a Quebecer and a Montrealer, I feel I should be able to post my opinions on those subs regardless of what they are as long as I respect the rules of the subs.    Currently I can't do that so like you said, I won't post.  But no, I don't think I have only myself to blame.  If I did not respect the rules, that would be a different story.  But, that's not the case.   Thanks for your reply."

It's not just a question of putting a roof over their heads.  What if they then decide to tear down the walls?  Damage the buildings?  Not respect their neighbors?  Sell or abuse drugs?  The list just goes on and on.  On an unrelated note are you really making 75k a year washing dishes because if so I'll gladly take your job while you help the homeless /u/manlydishwasher"
montreal,3cl7oe,_not_reasonable_,11,Wed Jul 8 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"You should know that there already exists many programs that offer 1$/day housing (with an address!) and jobs (Like Destination Centre Ville). I know because I volunteered with DCV cleaning streets and I met many former homeless, many of which had tons of stories. Also, working in DCV uniform, it was like I was in a parallel universe where normal people would just walk right through me and the homeless would treat me like a friend you regularly spend time with.  This is what I learned: Apart from the mentally unstable, the rest are there by choice. By this I mean, they may be a crack addict, but they still have the ability to escape if they garnered the willpower.  The mentally unstable need to be handled very carefully, because they are not capable of functioning as a part of society, no matter how hard you try to teach/punish them.  There are 4 missions in the downtown-ish area. They all serve 3 meals a day and offer shelter from the cold. The homeless are well taken care of already."

What do you think you would do that mission old brewery, welcome hall, and shelters don't do?  Not to be too hard or anything, but there are reasons to doubt that you over everyone else helping for the same goals will somehow 'succeed' where they haven't. Especially since there are many facets to homelessness besides simply funnelling them all into two warehouses and giving them 'small labour work' (what does that even mean?)."
montreal,3cl7oe,polyrythmie,3,Wed Jul 8 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid you don't understand enough the problem you claim to want to help with.  The issue is not that shelter is not available somewhere, it's precarious employment/living conditions which would not be solved by a couple more shelter options.  I interviewed a few people for that survey that came up with the 3,000 number (great experience and would do it again, by the way) and some of them had places to sleep.  They just weren't their places.  They were couchsurfing or temporarily moving between friends/relatives' places or they were, by choice, spending their evening in a restaurant or park instead of a shelter.  Stable and affordable housing, help integrating into the job market, this makes a difference for a lot of people, and a lot of other people are already working on this or providing services to homeless people.  Find out who they are and how you can help them.  Or just buy a homeless person a coffee or a gift card for a coffee.  Or tell a social worker sometime that you know and appreciate the job they do, because some of these people are truly amazing individuals doing great things for other people in the community without any recognition."

The fact that you think nobody has is a bit ignorant.  The fact you think it is simply a matter of money is a bit naive.   I agree that the government should be doing more.  I think if you want to make any significant change it would be to somehow influence the political scene.  Maybe run for local office and convince people that mental health services  and addiction management programs are a vital part of a thriving society.    Good luck :)

montreal,3cl7oe,ajourno,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:48:14 2015 UTC,"As an ED physician, the thought that simply providing a roof will get all of our homeless off the streets shows a poor understanding of how and why some of our homeless are on the street. Some patients have NO desire to have a roof, plain and simple.  You want to help, have everyone stop giving money to the homeless in the street and donate to shelters instead. Money given on the street too frequently goes to alcohol, which then results in the homeless being refused at shelters. Giving money on the street only helps to perpetuate the situation many homeless are in. I won't even begin to mention how much that 20$ made begging costs the system in ambulance transport, medical examinations, nursing time, and hospital resources for the homeless that are brought to EDs for being drunk ... where do you think they got the money to get drunk ?  This is not a simple problem, it certainly is one that needs some ""out of the box"" thinking so I commend your enthusiasm and desire to help !"
montreal,3cl7oe,Doc911,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"You can find a home for the 3000 current homeless but others from other provinces and suburbs will appear to replace them, it's an endless problem until it's taken care at the Federal level. You seem to be forgetting that a lot of homeless like it that way and others have mental problem that they don't want to face or get help with, even if it's free. So forcing them to to maintain a room might cost more then predicted. There is also the municipal problem, you can't just buy an abandoned rona and divide it into rooms, the zonage will get the place shutdown by the city and media will call them squatters. A relief would have to involve all 3 level of governance, trough out the country. There is already a major problem with unhealthy apartments in Montreal I say let's start by beefing up the tickets to bad renters and bad landlords so they follow the normal growth. Then we can think about subsidizing building renovations to be transformed into logement social where the demand is greater.  It might seem bad in Mtl since they are so clingy, but it's not the city with the highest % of BS and tourists will always attract beggars.  Unless you are ready to start a new political federal party you can send a letter to your representative."

If I buy the 10 tickets pack, can I for instance buy 2 tickets for the same movie, and go to the projection with someone I invite? Last question: the tickets are on sale as soon as Saturday, 1:00 p.m. Is it generally a super rush, human tide at the ticket booth in Concordia / tide of connection timed out on the website?

The more popular ones tend to fill up quickly.  If I'm not mistaken you can just pick the ones you want on the website and then pick them up in person.

montreal,3cgu4n,foedus,3,Sat Jul 11 07:21:55 2015 UTC,"There will be a line for a first day of ticket sales; anywhere between 75 and 200 people deep at any given time.  After the first few days thought it's generally only about 30 people long but by then the major films will be sold out.    As for buying multiples for one movie out of a 10-pack, it's never worked for me but I've never specifically asked.  When I filled in my sheet while in line, if the movie was sold out by the time I made it to the box office (I'm looking at you Sushi Girl and Ace Attorney!) you were told to choose another movie.  But ask them, it could definitely be different."
montreal,3cgu4n,_not_reasonable_,0,Fri Jul 10 09:02:06 2015 UTC,I really don't understand why people stay in line.  Is there some advantage I'm not aware of?  As soon as the clock hits 1 PM you can buy the tickets you want online.  Do they put aside certain tickets that are only available at the box office?

Here are some East Asian films that I'm looking forward to watching and hope I have time to see them all.  100 Yen Love July 18 • 8:45 PM J.A. De Seve Theatre  I’ve seen very good reviews about this Japanese indie film about a woman with no prospects who becomes a boxer. Sakura Ando stars, she was in Sion Sono’s Love Exposure.  The Arti: The Adventure Begins July 19 • 1:00 PM Concordia Hall Theatre  This Taiwanese animated features combines real life puppetry with computer animation. It’s the work of the Huang family, the nation’s most prominent puppet family. Looks really unique and interesting.  Miss Hokusai July 25 • 12:00 PM Concordia Hall Theatre  The latest animated feature from Production IG looks phenomenal. Based in the Edo period, it’s about the talented daughter of real life Japanese painter, Hokusai. She is an unsung contributor who helped her father produce some of the most well known works of art but remained uncredited.  Wild City July 25 • 9:30 PM Concordia Hall Theatre  Ringo Lam returns from a long break to direct a film in the Hong Kong crime genre, one which he is very familiar with. This is part of a thematic trilogy that includes City on Fire and Full Alert.  Big Match July 29 • 6:45 PM Concordia Hall Theatre  I’ve seen some good reviews of this Korean action comedy that stars Lee Jung Jae with an appearance from kpop queen BoA. In order to find his kidnapped brother, an MMA fighter must endure an elaborate set of games, that wealthy citizens bet on.  The Golden Cane Warrior July 31 • 7:15 PM Concordia Hall Theatre  An Indonesian martial arts flick that apparently has some nice scenery.  Assassination August 4 • 6:35 PM Concordia Hall Theatre  This is set in 1930s and has an all star cast including Ha Jung Woo, Jun Ji-hyun and Lee Jung Jae. Jun Ji Hyun is a sniper tasked to assassinate a Japanese army commander.  More picks: https://filmbeats.wordpress.com/2015/07/12/my-asian-movie-picks-for-fantasia-film-festival-july-14-august-4/"

You can do that tomorrow.  That's not what a monopoly is. That's not what a protection racket is either.  It's a regulated industry, just like many others.  If I were to bring out a folding table and set it up on the sidewalk in front of a popular bar and start serving drinks made with alcohol I produced myself in a my basement, I would get fined and shut down. Because in Montreal, you need a bar license to operate a bar. You need SAQ purchased alcohol and there are laws that dictate how cheap you can sell your product.  Yet, it's exactly what Uber is doing with their UberX service.  The company should be shutdown and its local administrators should get arrested.  Fuck everything about Uber."

The difference is that the taxi license GUARANTEES that the taxi is, well, a taxi driver, and that he has to follow some standards.  So let's upgrade the standards and Uber won't be necessary anymore."
montreal,3cfdkm,BurtKocain,-8,Tue Jul 7 21:43:13 2015 UTC,"Well since they have nothing to do in common, you're the one who'd have to explain how they are the same.  A medallion is nothing but a license to operate, just like a bar license. And just like a bar license, the city doesn't issue a new one.  This allow a central regulating body such as the Bureau du Taxi in this instance, to exert control over the operators.  That's why taxi driver needs special drivers license. That's why their car are subject to strict mechanical inspection. That's why they can receive a fine is their car is not clean enogh.  These regulations were put in place to protect the consumer."
montreal,3cfdkm,mambouli,6,Tue Jul 7 16:43:31 2015 UTC,"These regulations were put in place to protect the consumer.   Yet ask anyone, and they'll tell you uber cars are cleaner, newer and their drivers friendlier. The regulations were put in place as much to protect the consumer as the industry. But since the industry basically self-regulates though its political lobbying, the rules that protect the consumer are relaxed and sometimes not even respected, while the ones that protect the currently established industry through the weight of bureaucracy for newcomers are stronger than ever. So what if they their intent was to protect the customer, they're clearly not doing that."
montreal,3cfdkm,zyk0s,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"Well they protect the customer in the sense that drivers must have a driver's license that is harder to obtain, that the car is subjected to mechanical inspections, that the rate is a fixed rate. Meaning a driver cannot extort money out of someone who is clearly in a tight spot.  I don't think derugelation will do anyone any good in the long run, save for Uber's shareholders obviously.  Ubers car won't be cleaner, newer and the driver friendlier when Uber will have burn through most of the people willing to give it a go. Drivers don't stay with UberX very long, it takes a couple of months at most to realize how little you're making."
montreal,3cfdkm,mambouli,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:52:04 2015 UTC,"Well they protect the customer in the sense that drivers must have a driver's license that is harder to obtain   If it's harder to get, why do taxi drivers drive so badly and disregard almost every driving laws? How does that protect the consumer? At least with Uber, if they drive like that you can give a bad rating (and even contact their customer support) and they take those seriously. With taxis you can call and complain but they won't do anything.   the rate is a fixed rate. Meaning a driver cannot extort money out of someone who is clearly in a tight spot.   Taxis regularly scam people by not running the metre and charging a flat rate and even when they do run the metre, drive slower or take longer routes so that it costs more. With Uber the payment can be done through the app so there's no way that they can extort you out of your money. And while it's not a flat rate, at least you can see on the app exactly how much it'll cost before you get in, they can't make you pay more than what you agree on beforehand.   Ubers car won't be cleaner, newer and the driver friendlier when Uber will have burn through most of the people willing to give it a go. Drivers don't stay with UberX very long, it takes a couple of months at most to realize how little you're making.   So maybe in the long run Uber will become much worse than it is now and if that happens then some other company will pop up and simply offer something better. But the fact is that the service they offer now is much better than what the Taxi industry has to offer.  I don't agree with everything Uber's doing but I also have 0 sympathy for taxis, an industry that completely disregards its customers and is not doing anything to adapt."

montreal,3cfdkm,SDION,-2,Tue Jul 7 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"No. I don't think you could argue that it's a protection racket.  It's perfectly normal that the bureau of taxi limits the number of licenses issued. You cannot ask drivers to conform to very restrictive norms and then flood the market after that. The city isn't short on driver and there is not reason to issue new medallions.  After that, the remaining medallions issued follow a boringly normal supply-demand curve.  Uber is not skirting the law, it's blatantly ignoring it.  They could have revolutionized the taxi industry, by licensing their app for actual drivers, the way they started.  But with UberX, it's clear they simply want to replace the taxi industry.  Uber is going for the long con. But it seems everyone is focusing only on saving $2-3 and having the driver open their door (or whatever else makes the service so orgasmic - I was a daily cab rider for years and I never had anything to say about the service).  Uber is clearly planning on replacing the taxi industry with its amateur UberX driver.  And when that day will come, people will see what a non-competitive industry looks like."
montreal,3cfdkm,mambouli,8,Tue Jul 7 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"I understand the economics of it all - supply and demand. My word choice was poor as well, what they're doing is illegal not ""skirting the law"" as I put it.  I don't really want to get into semantics but you'd think that ""regulation"" would imply actual regulation rather than simply issuing medallions and checking a few ""mechanically correct"" boxes on a list. The general populace (your experience notwithstanding) is clearly dissatisfied with the service be it in regards to cleanliness, road manners, payment accessibility or general driver attitude. And that's why ""protection racket"" seems more appropriate wether or not it's a legal one, their subpar service is protected by the lack of available legal competition.  Now maybe people are just lying through their teeth. Maybe those clean cars, friendly ""cabbies"" who drive sanely, offer a selection of music, bottled water, show destination and price beforehand and are more transparent in terms of availability...maybe all of those things are just talking points that don't matter and people just like saving a few bucks.  And you know what, if that was the case I'd be with you - because Uber only costs slightly less because they aren't paying those medallions. I just legitimately don't think that's the case, the service is far better and people would chose Uber over a cab even if the price was the same (or hell - maybe higher)."
montreal,3cfdkm,SDION,0,Tue Jul 7 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"The service is better because UberX attracts new drivers with what amounts to lies. They promise far better wages than the driver actually ends up making.  And not only that, but when they are well installed in a market, they further reduce the ""cut"" of the driver.  Right now UberX is fresh and unknown. But wait til it levels out. Wait til UberX starts to get short on drivers who can maintain above 4.7 stars in rating and who also agrees to work for peanuts (even more so if you factor in car depreciation and all the current legal risks).  See this article from a journalist who went undercover as a uberX driver for an extended period of time.  The reason why the taxi industry is the way it is is not because of some protection. It's just the nature of the business. You get the cab that is the closest to you, before and above all. People have absolutely zero loyalty towards drivers (even if they wanted, they couldn't), so drivers have no incentive to step up their game.  UberX is doing fine right now because it can burn through unlimited supply of driver. But an app is not gonna change this fundamental fact  : you take the car the closest to you."
montreal,3cfdkm,mambouli,2,Wed Jul 8 01:37:23 2015 UTC,"I like your explanation and can respect your opinion. The downvotes are overwhelmingly unjustified and it's a nuisance to discussion.  I'm not going to follow through on the whole ""you'll see what happens next"" narrative because it's speculation and I'm not basing an argumentative on ""ifs"", ""buts"" and ""maybes"".  As for the drivers no, you can't guarantee a specific one. You can guarantee a level of service throughout a company/industry though. And while you mock the 4.7 star rating requirement, Uber can and does ""enforce"" standards whereas Taxi dispatches basically act on the premises that if you have a medallion you can do what you want. That is unacceptable and it was, in fact, my first point earlier today."

montreal,3cfdkm,domo9001,0,Tue Jul 7 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"uber service is simply better.    It's only better now, because the company is less than  1 year old.  They get good service because they make false promises to drivers in terms of revenues. After they are well settled in a market, they cut the part that the driver receives.  So all those driver that made you fall in love with the service, they're all long gone. And you're stuck with the exact same kind of people that run normal cabs.  But in the end, it doesn't matter if the service is better, because it is illegal.   Fuck I could offer MUCH better service than a notary, if you wan to close the deal on your house. I'll charge 1/3 and serve  you champagne. Sure, what I do is absolutely illegal, but who cares, my service is so much better."

montreal,3cfdkm,ProposMontreal,2,Tue Jul 7 21:49:45 2015 UTC,I'd say it's a pretty far fetch comparison.  There's no regulations against anyone boosting anyone's car or unlocking their doors. Towing companies don't pay for licenses to do so.  Towing companies tow. That's why they have those trucks. And taxis aren't doing that.  Taxis drive people to destination for money. There are regulations against anyone doing that.Taxi companies do pay for licenses to have the right to do that.

And don't fall into insults, I'm pretty sure you are better than that."
montreal,3cfdkm,ProposMontreal,2,Wed Jul 8 13:23:59 2015 UTC,"Well as I said, taxi drivers have to pay a special license, a meddalions and subject themselves to many rules and checks that UberX drivers don't have to.  That's why it's unfair.  It is not the case in the exemple you described.  Towing companies don't pay licensing in order to boost cars or unlock doors.  I assume they have a special license to tow other people's car. And that's normal. We don't want anybody just start moving other people's cars. You'd want this industry regulated.  What UberX drivers are doing is essentially like if I JerryRigged my pick-up and that I started towing people around. I don't have any training or special insurance, I don't have any of the safety features and most importantly, I don't have a license that can revoqued if I don't respect the rules and regulations.  Now that would be unfair competition.  If somebody has to get a license, then everybody has to get a license.  That's why I support taxi drivers.  There's two ways to go at this. Either we force Uber to play by the taxi's rules : commercial drivers license, medallions, commercial insurance, fixed rate, much more expensive tickets .  Or we entirely deregulate the taxi industry and we let the taxi drivers play by Uber's rule : no need for special license, no need for meddalions, anyone with a car can do commercial transport.  I don't believe this second option to be better in the long run.  But you can't have half the industry forced to follow rules and regulations and the other half do whatever the fuck it wants. That's the unfair competition.  ""Oh but their service is so much better"". Who gives a fuck, it's illegal. I'll be impressed if Uber can maintain a better service WHILE respecting all the same ruls and regulations that taxi drivers must respect.  As I said elsewhere, I think Uber Taxi is a great innovation. It could have facilitate booking, payment and traceability of taxis. Uber could have become the driver's best partners.  Instead, it started waging war against them.  Fuck everything about Uber."

ANd i,m happy that you were able to make the difference between Uber and UberX  But two things still gets me:   From someone who as taken a lot of taxi in his life, why can't they offer a proper service, in cars where the suspension is usually about to fall of, smelling like little green trees. It's all about the user experience and taking a taxi, usually leave a bad taste in one's mouth. I have a problem with any industry (not public) that rely solely on government intervention instead of looking at competition in a way to improve themselves.   Taxi have been resting on their laurel for to long and a good slap in the face like they are having right now across the world can only be beneficial for the collective users. I have written about the taxi industry a few time  and no one would love to see them improve more then me, but first, they have to look in the mirror, not at UberX"
montreal,3cfdkm,ProposMontreal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"It's all about the user experience and taking a taxi, usually leave a bad taste in one's mouth.   The thing is that drivers were quick to realize that it's absolutely not about the user experience.  It's about whichever taxi is the closest.  I remember once taking a taxi where the driver was wearing a suit. He had the day's newspaper in the back. He was awesome.  But it's not like this will help him get more runs. It's not like I can try to get him instead of others.  The man had great work ethics, but in the end, it doesn't help him get more business.  And my prediction is that UberX will soon folllow the same pattern.  UberX drivers are getting exploited, there's no doubt about that. When you factor in the depreciation of their car, they make almost no money.  And UberX hasn't started dropping the driver's cut here yet, like they have in other market. But they will and this will accentuate the problem.  There will come a time where UberX will not be able to afford to get rid of drivers who score below a 4.7 stars average. Because those that have nice clean cars, thos who wear a suit, open the door for you and offer you water bottles will be long gone.   So the general level of service will slowly decline, until the point where it'll be indistinguishable from current taxis.  No one will pass on a driver that only has a 3 star rating if he's right around the corner. It's just a little car ride after all."

Et j'ai d'ailleurs répondu à tout ça ailleurs dans le thread.  J'ai travaillé comme bartender pendant de nombreuses années sans posséder de voiture. J'ai pris des centaines sinon des milliers de taxi. Et mon impression générale était tout à fait positive.  Est-ce que je suis déjà tombé sur des connards? Certes, comme c'est le cas partout.

Mais c'est littéralement la seule et unique fois que ça s'est produit. J'ai plutôt de nombreux cas en tête où j'avais suggéré une route et que le chauffeur m'en a proposé une meilleure (genre que je suggérais de descendre Parc,  mais le chauffeur faisait noter qu'à cette heure, Parc n'avait qu'une voie pour descendre).   Le chauffeur qui écoute la radio dans le tapis sans me demander mon avis   Finissant généralement un shift dans un bar passé sous les speakers, j'ai pratiquement toujours demandé au chauffeur de femrer la radio. Jamais un chauffeur n'a refusé. C'est certain que je le demande poliment. Et que je ne suis pas entitled au point de m'offusquer parce qu'on ne m'a pas demandé mon avis au préalable.   L'air climatisé qui marche pas   Never ever happened.   Les conversations au téléphone du chauffeur   Qu'est-ce que je m'en criss que le chauffeur parle au téléphone? Tant qu'il peut interrompre sa conversation quand il le faut, ce qui est toujours arrivé. Faut vraiment se penser le centre de l'univers pour se fâcher parce que quelqu'un parle au téléphone à côté de toi.   L'air bête des chauffeurs   Meh. J'ai pas besoin de faux sourir Walmart, juste de me faire emmener du point A au point B. Est-ce que j'ai rencontré des chauffeurs blasés? Certes. Je le serais aussi à force de passer mes journées sur la route. Sois tu apprends à te crisser de tout, soit tu te tappes un petit épisode de road rage à chaque jour.  Mais sérieux, on m'a toujours parlé poliment. Et comme je l'ai dit plus haut, j'ai rencontré des tas de chauffeurs hyper sympathique avec qui j'ai eu de bonnes converations.   Les chauffeurs qui parlent pas le français ou l'anglais   Never, ever, ever happened. Ever.   Les véhicules qui ont 2,000,000 de km et qui tombent en ruine   J'ai déjà vu une toyota camry avec plus de 500,000 km. Elle était loin de tomber en ruine, tout comme 100% des taxis dans lesquels je suis embarqué. Aucune idée de quoi tu parles. Ou peut-être cherchais-tu simplement à allonger ta liste de griefs?   La conduite dangereuse   Les taxis sont un peu cowboys quand ils se rendent à un client pour ne pas se faire voler la course. Une fois que t'es assis dedans, ils prennent généralement ça très relax.  Et je ne trouve pas que les taxis conduisent plus dangereusement que la population générale. Sure ils me gosssent quand je les suis et qu'ils roulent à 20 pour essayer de repérer un client, mais je comprends quand même.  Et j'ai gardé ça pour la fin :    Les taxis qui préfèrent être payés cash (pour frauder l'impôt?) - Les taxis qui annoncent ""Visa/Master Card"", mais la machine est ""brisée""   Ça semble être le grief principale de pas mal tout le monde. Personellement, j'ai toujours payé cash.  Ceci étant dit, je doute fort qu'ils préfèrent le cash pour ne pas payer d'impôt. Je suis pas mal certain que la course est déclarée dès que le compteur démarre. Et si ce n'est pas le cas, c'est à Revenu Québec de se pencher là-dessus, la solution ne consiste pas à déréguler l'industrie.  Je ne connais pas les rouages du système et il s'agit donc de conjectures, mais je serais porté à croire que c'est les frais de services qui embêtent les chauffeurs de taxi. Les marchands doivent payer entre 3-5% du montant de la transaction en frais de service aux compagnies de cartes de crédit et quelque chose comme $0.50 (ou plus) pour une carte de débit.  Je peux comprendre qu'un chauffeur qui travaille 14h par jour pour joindre les deux bouts soit un peu embêté de perdre 5% de la vente (ce qui peut représenter un bien plus gros pourcentage du profit). Même chose pour un frais de $0.50 sur une course de $7.  Je les comprends de s'essayer.  Mais de toute façon, Cardinal est dans le champ. Ceci n'a rien à voir avec taxis traditionnels vs Uber.  Pratiquement tout ce que tu décris va se retrouver chez Uber dans pas trop long.  Pour l'instant, UberX est relativement nouveau ici. Uber peut donc se permettre de se départir des chauffeurs qui ne se maitiennent pas au-dessu de 4.7 étoiles.  Mais une fois implantée dans un marché, Uber coupe la part des chauffeurs pour se rendre encore plus attrayante. Les chauffeurs attentionnés, avec leurs bouteilles d'eau et leurs voitures neuves font rapidement le calcul qu'ils se font fourrer d'aplomb. Et rapidement, tu te retrouves avec exactement les mêmes chauffeurs dans les taxis et dans Uber. Ce n'est pas des ""peut-être que""; ça a déjà commencé dans d'autres villes (source : http://citypaper.net/uberdriver/).  C'est un fait fondamental de l'industrie : le client n'est pas et ne peut pas être loyal envers le chauffeur. Le client prends la voiture la plus proche.  Tant qu'il reste des chauffeurs potentiels à exploiter, Uber peut maintenir un haut niveau de service. Mais rapidement, ils seront rattrapés par cette réalité.  Ça me fait rire tout ça. C'est comme les gens qui sont prêts à changer de ligne aérienne pour sauver $12 sur leur vol transatlantique, mais qui se plaignent après d'être traité comme du bétail. No shit!"

Waiting an hour past your appointment time seems pretty par for the course - I've seen specialists in hospitals, clinics and private medical centres and had to wait. Is it fun? No, but alas, not specific to this hospital.  Ditto having a bunch of booths with a line -- most places I have been (admittedly, just a few private clinics and two Mtl hospitals, I haven't been everywhere) operate under the same system. It's not rocket science to figure out- do you think people would be waiting in a long line if they didn't have to? There doesn't really need to be a sign saying ""If the booths look free but there's a long line next to them, you probably need to be in line too"".   Also... the hospital doesn't really get to control the weight of its patients, so that's a pretty ridiculous and pointless complaint.

Près d'une école la masse devient trop importante à ignorer (les limites sont d'ailleurs en fonction de l'heure et du mois, une excellente chose), le reste du temps tu t'attend à ce qu'un enfant normal regarde vaguement des deux bords avant de traverser. Il y a une limite à légiférer en se basant sur le pire scénario possible.   Mais je vais dire comme dans un autre commentaire - s'il y a un taux particulièrement élevé d'accidents dans une rue (enfant ou pas), c'est le temps de penser à mettre des mesures d'atténuation: limites, speed bumps ou autre. Une réduction généralisée c'est contre-productif et injustifié.   Ce qui me fait plus chier c'est d'avoir un stop au 10 mètres. Probablement pour plus de contraventions.

Je suis d'accord que de réduire la vitesse max dans les chemins principaux à 40 ou même 30, comme l'ont fait plusieurs villes tel que St-Therèse, n'est pas nécessaire, mais je croit aussi que d'avoir des vitesses max de 30 ou 40 dans les petites rues ne cause pas vraiment de problèmes à qui que ce soit, et aide à améliorer la sécurité et à réduire le bruit."

À la limite ils pourraient baisser les limites à 7-8 le matin et 3-4 le soir lorsque les enfants rentrent/sortent de l'école, mais avec la largeur/visibilité sur nos rues c'est plutôt futile.  Ils ont même fait passer les vitesses de 30 à 40 dans les rues résidentielles (il y a environ 3 ans) et clairement sa n'a rien changé. Tout le monde roulait à 45-55, tout le monde roule encore à 45-55. Je miserais fort qu'ils pourraient monter la vitesse à 50 et sa ne changerait pas plus - y'a trop de stop de toute façon.  Sa c'est anecdotal mais les études le supportent, les gens roulent à une vitesse dirigée par les conditions de la route - pas la vitesse postée. ""aide à améliorer la sécurité"" sa feel raisonnable comme affirmation mais c'est pas vraiment basé sur la réalité.  Pour le bruit je pourrais concéder un point.

Dans les petites rue résidentielles la vitesse optimale réelle n'est pas la même que la vitesse optimale théorique (qui est d'environ 80km/h) car il faut freiner très fréquemment pour s'arrêter aux stops/feux, ce n'est pas comme si c'était une route de plusieurs kilomètre sans stops / feux rouges.   Research in Germany has shown that the greater the speed of vehicles in built-up areas, the higher is the incidence of acceleration, deceleration, and braking, all of which increase air pollution. German research indicates that traffic calming reduces idle times by 15%, gear changing by 12%, brake use by 14%, and gasoline use by 12% (Newman and Kenworthy 1992, 39–40). This slower and calmer style of driving reduces emissions, as demonstrated by an evaluation in Buxtehude, Germany. Table E-1 shows the relative change in emissions and fuel use when the speed limit is cut from 50kmh (31mph) to 30kmh (19mph) for two different driving styles. Even aggressive driving under the slower speed limit produces lower emissions (but higher fuel use) than under the higher speed limit, although calm driving produces greater reductions for most emissions and net fuel savings (Newman and Kenworthy 1992, 39 –40)."

Study after study has shown most motorist generally drive at a safe speed for the situation.  One time in the US, when the speed limit on highways was raised from 55 mph to 65 mph, I felt much safer!  not more huge variations of speed among cars leading to people merging in and out of lanes.  And studies have shown it's the speed variation among cars that lead to higher rates of accident.  Energy of impact is BS - the 'logical' conclusion of that argument is to ban cars."
montreal,3cf812,BurtKocain,-1,Wed Jul 8 11:05:19 2015 UTC,"you all are missing my argument - that the majority of motorists will not drive over what is safe for the road, proven by scientific studies.  By artificially forcing a low limit, all you are doing is making criminals and also possibly setting unsafe conditions for all.  This is true for highways, true for city streets.  The best way to do it is do a sampling of what the traffic of the street generally is, then you'll have a good idea of how to proceed with setting limits."
montreal,3cf812,mtlpat,6,Tue Jul 7 14:18:12 2015 UTC,"Your argument is total bunk.  The problem is not that the majority of people drive safely, but the tiny minority of assholes (I bet you're one of them) who insist on driving fast no matter what, either because they have to compensate for some perceived anatomical deficiency, or they are just totally inept at properly managing their time."

montreal,3cf812,mark1s,3,Wed Jul 8 02:46:46 2015 UTC,"His point is true, people drive at a perceived safe speed based on road conditions regardless of posted limits. School zones don't necessarily have anything limiting speed but there's a higher risk (yano...careless children) so the limit has to be strictly enforced.  Single-lane, one way streets with cars on both sides and potholes everywhere don't favour high speeds and so people drive slow. How often do you see people blasting through at 70kph when they have an inch on both sides? Lowering speed limits would do nothing for those small streets but those that have proper clearance/wide lanes/nice tarmarc/etc would suddenly see people getting ticketed while driving at the same safe pace as they do now."

Faut pas se leurrer: à chaque fois qu'on enclave des quartiers, on crée des situations où en premier lieu ce sont les gens à mobilité réduite qui perdent leur autonomie et leur liberté, et ça progresse dans les strates sociales jusqu'à impacter tout le monde. On a pas besoin d'ériger des murs physiques (comme les gated communities chez notre voisin du Sud) pour restreindre mentalement les gens... Suffit de donner l'impression que tu as tout ce que tu veux ici (et qu'ailleurs ils sont blablabla) pour que ça progresse émotivement à la méfiance, et éventuellement au mépris.  Je suis pour la vie de quartier lorsqu'on ne restreint pas les déplacements et que le développement est fait harmonieusement à échelle humaine. Par contre, je suis contre la vie de quartier isolante qui favorise certains au détriments de tous.   Dans le cas du plateau, ils travaillent plus fort sur la réduction de services perçus comme bénéficiant trop ""les externes"" que sur l'augmentation des services offerts aux résidents. Si le maire était sérieux dans sa démarche de désengorger le plateau, il ferait pression sur le MTQ/la ville pour transformer Papineau en vrai boulevard urbain à 2 voies en chaque sens sur toute la longueur (au lieu du goulot à 1 voie actuel), et reconfigurerait les routes municipales pour favoriser la cohabitation piéton/vélo/véhicules/transport en commun. Créer un chemin qui attire les gens au lieu de détruire ce qui marche déjà pas très bien, c'est apparemment au delà des compétences de ces administrations municipales sans imagination."

La faible assistance des dernières années n'était pas seulement attribuable à un manque d'intérêt de la part des amateurs.

Par contre je suis d'avis qu'avec un nouveau stade extérieur au centre-ville de faible dimension contenant moins de 42 000 places et où l'on voit bien le jeu de partout (comme le AT&T park à San Francisco bâti avec des fonds privés, svp!), le succès serait assuré.

montreal,3cf1zy,Prof_G,3,Tue Jul 7 16:29:09 2015 UTC,"4000 me semble être un chiffre plutôt élevé, mais l'itinérance est un symptome de problèmes encore plus important. Le manque d'intervention adéquat pour l'addiction et l'état pitoyable du traitement des maladies mentales font en sorte que nous ayons une population relativement grande de sans-abri."

montreal,3cf1zy,ProposMontreal,6,Tue Jul 7 23:46:54 2015 UTC,"Seulement ?  The situation here is insane. I've lived in a lot of places, some of them really big like Paris and New York, and I have never been panhandled as often or as aggressively as in Montreal. I have twice said ""désolé"" to guys when they asked for change and I didn't give them any, and they started screaming at me that I wasn't really sorry, that I was a lying asshole, that I could go fuck myself, etc. Never happened to me before in my life.  You can't walk down Ste-Catherine, Mont-Royal, St-Denis, or anywhere near McGill or the Old Port without being absolutely accosted and seeing dozens of homeless people lying on sidewalks or huddling in door frames.  Not to mention the seasonal squeegee kids who roll in from God knows where every summer and take over the Latin Quarter and downtown.  I don't know what the problem is, but I sincerely doubt that Montreal has that many more mentally unstable people per capita than anywhere else."
montreal,3cf1zy,holymadness,11,Tue Jul 7 13:51:31 2015 UTC,"20 years ago, you would've seen a comparable number of homeless people on the streets of NYC or London.  Those cities didn't 'fix' homelessness, they just criminalised it, and basically swept their homeless populations under the rug.  This trend was so successful (especially in NYC, which started it) that cities all across the world began following suit.  Montreal is one of the exceptions, and I'm happy for it.  EDIT That said, Montreal is still doing plenty to push homeless people out of downtown."
montreal,3cf1zy,bopollo,3,Tue Jul 7 15:25:56 2015 UTC,This! Montreal is simply more tolerant of itinerants than most other major cities.

montreal,3cf1zy,paillotdechevre,2,Tue Jul 7 17:09:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're leaving because of the panhandlers.  That may be an issue for a few, but the prime reason is the irrational price of real estate near the centre, versus the rapid and irresponsible construction of cheap homes in the suburbs."
montreal,3cf1zy,bopollo,-1,Tue Jul 7 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"Panhandlers are one of many issues.   the prime reason is the irrational price of real estate near the centre, versus the rapid and irresponsible construction of cheap homes in the suburbs.   That's because Montreal suffers from the same Nimbyism as San Francisco. You can't oppose gentrification and densification and turn districts like the Plateau into mini suburbs and then complain about real suburbs having greater appeal."
montreal,3cf1zy,paillotdechevre,3,Tue Jul 7 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you're singling the plateau out for criticism. It has a very high population density while still being a livable neighbourhood (i.e. not just a collection of high-rises next to a freeway). If anything, more neighbourhoods in Montreal should resemble the plateau, with excellent access to public transit, protected bike lanes, mixed residential and commercial zoning, and mid-rise multi-unit housing. The entire orange line corridor, stretching from Berri-UQAM to Jarry, contains what are very close to ideal neighbourhoods. If they're expensive (and they are), it's because there aren't enough of them to meet demand.  The real NIMBYism in Montreal is taking place on the periphery, where people living in single-family home neighbourhoods like W. Ahuntsic and St-Leonard are opposed to the new construction guidelines of the PMAD that encourage multi-unit housing on public transport axes over single-family dwellings in suburban layouts.  Montreal doesn't resemble San Francisco in any plausible way. There are currently dozens of massive construction projects everywhere in the city, including hundreds of condos downtown and in Griffintown. In fact, nothing in your post makes sense. If suburbs are so appealing, why does turning central neighbourhoods into ""mini surburbs"" make them less appealing?  Suburbs have no appeal aside from the fact that they're cheap. Their lack of appeal is reflected in their price relative to desirable central communities."

I wouldn't hire a homeless person because if they can't manage to have the bare minimum required for a healthy life, they probably don't have the interpersonal, problem solving or technical skills required.

montreal,3cf5zh,dpc59,2,Tue Jul 7 21:06:19 2015 UTC,I believe they use summer months to do maintenance on the escalators because there is less users. It makes sense.

montreal,3cf5zh,atworktemp,2,Tue Jul 7 19:35:15 2015 UTC,"Depending on how bad the damage is, based on the lead times I've seen for other machinery that looks like similar complexity, a complete replacement of all the critical parts and complete overhaul could take anywhere between 6 to 18 months from A to Z.   That would include the time for handling the order & administration stuff (2-3 weeks), engineering, specifications & logistics (2-5 more weeks for such a project), finding suppliers for parts and materials, subcontractors for the odd part you can't make in house, etc., making the parts (2-12 weeks depending on the part, + up to 4 due to production capacity overbooking or similar delays), quality control, any necessary replacements for parts that don't pass inspection, assembly, documentation, preparation, packaging, and so on.   For just one rush-order, specific spare part? Well, an entire motor block is six to twelve weeks.  And naturally, throughout all of this, is the underlying and evident assumption that the STM was stupid enough to not order any spare parts in advance or at least have someone very incompetent in charge of maintaining spare part stock, and at the same time they're hiring a contractor that cannot or doesn't want to maintain a spare parts stock of their own and/or is content to let the STM stew on that order for a couple months while they wait for the material to arrive from China by boat, be shipped to India by boat, be machined in India because it's cheaper, be shipped back here by boat..."

Plus the fucking little dingy bells on the bixis barely work, and nobody even pays attention to them. I end up yelling most of the time and then I look like the asshole.

Sort of like they have to look before crossing a road unless they are planning to jump in front of a car going 40km/h.

No wonder the pedestrian didn't see the bike, it's not obvious that bikes aren't going the same way as cars.  Montreal sucks when you're biking, people drive like shit, half of the cyclists don't know what a red light or a stop sign is and pedestrians don't pay attention to bikes.

Same thing for cars, or anyone using the road really; you wouldn't expect a purpose built bike lane to go against the traffic on a one way street. So you don't check, or forget too and it creates a hazard until an actual accident occurs.  This is just idiotic. And the marking on the bike lane to indicate the flow of bike traffic is maybe 10m apart, i.e. not visible from everywhere."

I will absolutely agree that the paint indicating bike lane direction is too far apart. I haven't noticed if they paint them close to intersections consistently or not.   People seem to manage well with one-way and two-way streets when they encounter them. All they need are those little arrow signs. Perhaps something similar could be done to indicate anti-sense bike lanes."

It never really occurred to me before sunday, but there is no giant chips/pop/cookies/snacks/killsyou section at PA and I respect that. You can still get junk food there, it just isn't the majority of the store like some other retailers.  Adonis is also awesome."

Super C feels a little more ghetto but has better pricing. Adonis is great as it has a lot of variety and I really enjoy the middle eastern ingrediants.  I like having access to small asian grocers for the ingrediants and the really cheap veggies :)  Metro and IGA are by far the worst, everything is overpriced (especially IGA, screw them.)"
montreal,3cfusn,pkzilla,2,Tue Jul 7 18:22:27 2015 UTC,"I do like Metro and IGA because they offer me a bunch of meat ready for BBQ or stuffed meat with amazing sauce/ingredients when Super C/Maxi/Provigo can't offer me that variety of products. I do buy everything else at Maxi but when it comes to meat, Metro & IGA are on another level."
montreal,3cfusn,Goalchenyuk87,5,Wed Jul 8 05:23:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because I'd rather marinate my own meats, but I find Adonis to be much better in the marinated meat sections.

Being from NYC, we don't drive. I'm unsure if you do, but if you don't here's a nice grocery shopping hint that I learned last weekend: if you go to Metro grocery and tell the cashier you would like it delivered and the groceries will be at the place you are staying in an hour or so. This sure beats strolling my toddler while carrying the day's groceries on my back as I'm also pregnant! I'm unsure if other markets offer this service. We have great delivery options like Fresh Direct in NYC but I couldn't find one comparable here--epanneur was overpriced and only provided bulk chicken breasts for meat."

montreal,3cfusn,_not_reasonable_,6,Tue Jul 7 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"I think honestly your question is just too vague.  I personally know of several great Asian grorcery stores which are large but might not considered as ""popular"" or have adequate ""merchandising and shelves"" as you put it.  Montreal is a hell of a foodie city.  Are you looking for Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Korean or Japanese grocery stores (only to name a few)?  It also does sound like you're asking /r/montreal to do your job for you.  Was google maps too hard to use or are you looking for something specific?  This sub gets a lot of questions that could have been answered with a quick search, so the users tend to answer accordingly."
montreal,3cfusn,StealthAccount,2,Tue Jul 7 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"I like your handle! :)  I used the words ""big / popular"" to imply mainstream grocers.  I have plotted a map of Montreal based on a lengthy google search and did read of store reviews. I basically got Maxi (loblaws), Metro, IGA and Super Marche PA. As I am searching in english, I was unsure if I was even googling the right thing to get an accurate finding.   I appreciate the insight and feedback of those who answered!! Definitely gave me some places I had not found on my own -- thank you very much for your help !"
montreal,3cfusn,cash38,2,Tue Jul 7 20:43:05 2015 UTC,"I live downtown in an area where the Metro is the closest, with PA/Provigo and Super C increasingly further away.  I go to Metro out of laziness despite hating the increased prices. Like above people said, when you don't own a car, proximity is the main deciding factor. PA is way better/cheaper for meat and produce and I tend to make healthier choices there because it lacks the visual focus on packaged junk. Super C is a little further away but I still go there once a week to get bulkier items like big packs of chicken or a lot of stuff for a bbq.   Also..what is your job title? I study Geography/GIS and have done a bit of geodemographics work, do you have any recommendations of how to job search and what to look for?   Thanks."

montreal,3cfusn,crsh1976,4,Tue Jul 7 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"Proximity is usually the main factor in selecting a grocery store.  The main chains are Maxi, Super C, Loblaws, Metro. There are also large ''ethnic'' groceries like Adonis (middle Eastern), Mourelatos (Greek), PA (kinda middle Eastern) and many more.  In Summer (open year-round but less interesting in winter) you also have many public markets. Jean-Talon and Atwater being the largest ones.  Walmart is also into groceries now and is gaining market shares."

montreal,3cfusn,ARC1981,3,Wed Jul 8 02:44:07 2015 UTC,"Big chains like Provigo/Loblaw's, Metro, IGA, etc.  There are two Provigos near where I live (NDG), one is decent but farther (on Monkland Ave), the other is barely adequate but closer (on Sherbrooke) - by adequate I mean it's fine for the common stuff you'd find anywhere, but the second you're looking for something a little less mainstream, they either have no idea what you're talking about or it's out of stock.  There are other supermarkets in the general area, Loblaw's is better but pricier than your typical Provigo, Metro is also better in my book - they are a little further away for me, but close enough that I do shop there from time to time.  One thing I miss from my previous neighbourhood is a public market - the one I'm specifically talking about is on the corner of Cote-des-Neiges and Jean-Brillant in CDN. What a great place for fruits & veggies.  I much prefer a smaller venue called Le maitre-boucher on Monkland Ave.; pricier than a supermarket, but the quality and choice of products is nothing short of awesome."
montreal,3cfusn,lshi,2,Tue Jul 7 16:53:16 2015 UTC,That market on the corner of Cote-des-Neiges is lovely.
montreal,3cfusn,NLemay,2,Wed Jul 8 01:14:17 2015 UTC,I would also say proximity is the most important factor. I live right next to a Provigo and a Marche PA and I generally do most of my grocery shopping at the Marche PA. It's so much cheaper!

montreal,3cfusn,BurtKocain,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:55:09 2015 UTC,"IGA are popular because they have the best marketing/organized stores, and they focus their marketing on smells and visuals which is why when you walk into the store, all the fresh produce is in wooden barrels right at the entrance. Despite the fact that IGA is a good 50% more expensive than other stores. Metro is in the same situation. IGA/Metro also have little take out food counters.  Maxi is quite cheaper, as is Provigo. They focus a lot less on organisation and marketing within the store. Its almost no-frills. No food counters.   Then there are independents like PA Supermarché, Adonis etc. they're all pretty decent.   I typically do my groceries at Provigo or Maxi. I cant stand Sobeys."

montreal,3cb0bq,smuffleupagus,3,Tue Jul 7 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"I knew that first and last month's rent/a security deposit/etc. is illegal! As far as I'm aware, all they're permitted to ask for is the first month's rent."
montreal,3cb0bq,Le_dob,2,Mon Jul 6 15:46:21 2015 UTC,"Haha, just making sure. My boyfriend is from AB and I know he got stiffed for a deposit when he first moved here!"
montreal,3cb0bq,Entegy,3,Mon Jul 6 15:56:02 2015 UTC,"No no, I appreciate it so much! Renting here is so different from renting in Montreal -- we were genuinely surprised and scrambling when we realized that a lot of places wouldn't include a fridge and a stove. We told our friends here that and they were baffled."
montreal,3cb0bq,bopollo,2,Mon Jul 6 15:57:51 2015 UTC,"If you see ""semi-meublé"" that means fridge and stove. Otherwise you can try to bargain them in."
montreal,3cb0bq,blumsy,2,Mon Jul 6 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"I used to have an apartment that included them but didn't put them on the lease, so if anything went wrong the landlord wouldn't be responsible."
montreal,3cb0bq,blumsy,2,Mon Jul 6 16:34:58 2015 UTC,"I looked for apartments in Ottawa, had my own fridge and stove, much better than what they were proposing.  They looked at me all funny when I told them I wanted to bring my own appliances..."
montreal,3cb0bq,antitoaster,2,Mon Jul 6 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"I just can't imagine moving with such heavy appliances! My dad said that when he lived in Kingston, though, the water heater cost extra if they wanted it!"
montreal,3cb0bq,blumsy,2,Mon Jul 6 17:42:18 2015 UTC,"Yup, a landlord may ask for up to the full amount of the first month's rent and not a penny more."
montreal,3cb0bq,confusion07,2,Mon Jul 6 18:00:16 2015 UTC,"The short answer is no, they can't ask for that stuff.  However, you do have to prove your identity and that's complicated to do from a distance.  If you were in person, you'd briefly show the owner your driver's license and that would be that.  Unless someone else has a better suggestion, I'd suggest simply sending a photocopy of your Medicare card just to make things easy on you (I don't think there's much an identity thief can do just with your Medicare card).  The owner can do a credit check (with your consent), but all they need for that is a name, address, and date of birth.  The idea that the owner would open a Hydro account for you is bullshit, and so's asking for the other stuff.  Now, the trick is how to tell the owner that they're full of shit without losing the apartment.  I'd suggest simply sending them the info I've mentioned, give your consent for a credit check, nothing more, and don't say anything about it.  See what happens.    If they still give you shit, at that point you should consider looking for another place.  There are lots of vacancies right now.  On the other hand, if you're in a fightin' mood, you should contact the owner, record the call, get them to say something incriminating, then blackmail them.    Quebec has excellent protections for tenants.  Don't be afraid to exercise your rights.  If you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to call the Regie des Logements.  They give excellent service (in English, too) and they'll fight for you.  1-800-683-2245"
montreal,3cb0bq,blumsy,3,Mon Jul 6 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have read a lot on tenants rights in Quebec, so I knew right away that the SIN wasn't necessary for a credit check, and since they said my Hydro was included in the rent I was skeptical when they said they needed it to open accounts for me. Called them, basically said that I wasn't willing to provide my SIN or care card number, they said it was totally fine, and that was that."
montreal,3cb0bq,compulsive_shopper,2,Mon Jul 6 15:07:24 2015 UTC,"I've got an amazing landlord right now who has a few properties available August first. I'm heading to Baltimore in September otherwise I'd be staying in this place for way longer as a good landlord is very hard to come by in this city. Good price, beautiful neighbourhood. Pm me if you want his number so he can send you some listings."
montreal,3cb0bq,compulsive_shopper,2,Mon Jul 6 15:45:50 2015 UTC,"I'll keep that in mind if this doesn't go through! We really do like the apartment and since they immediately acknowledged they didn't need either of those pieces of information and everything else has seemed totally fine, we're still going to go for it unless we aren't approved."

montreal,3c8zb6,Jerry_Hat-Trick,-3,Mon Jul 6 03:21:02 2015 UTC,"Because it is a menacing looking dog with no one holding the leash. Even if someone were holding the leash it is a breed and owner group with a terrible reputation. With so many children and random noises and gestures happening, the thought pf a very strong dog going crazy makes many uncomfortable. That is why."
montreal,3c8zb6,Miwwies,4,Mon Jul 6 04:13:15 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you're right about some pitbull owners not being responsible. There was another guy with a black pittie who had him off the leash which was not cool. You can't tell from this picture because I was on the ground with her but her leash is tied to me. Luckily, she's very good-natured and well-socialized. Seemed like anyone who was scared of her kept their distance but lots of people asked if they could say hi and got their faces licked!"
montreal,3c8zb6,ImMyOwnGrandad,6,Mon Jul 6 05:08:40 2015 UTC,"It's sad that people often point fingers at bigger dogs. I'm going to be honest here, I don't like small dogs. They bark at everything, are so insecure because their owners always have them on their lap they bite, they don't behave because their owner have no idea how to handle a dog. The amount of things a small dog can get away with is insane. You can't be this careless with a medium or big dog.   I'm more wary of the small dogs. And here's why:  I was walking my dog a few days ago, and I passed someone with a dwarf pinscher. The little doggie was barking like mad so I moved to the bike path to clear the sidewalk and ask my own dog to sit. I have a young dog and wanted to train calmness in this type of situation. The little pinscher had the nerve to step down from the sidewalk and nip one of my heels while I was focusing on rewarding my pup's concentration on me. I refrained from the intention of kicking the pinscher if it was going for another bite because as soon as I went for it to ""correct it"" with a big ""no!"" it ran away on the retractable leash and the lady laughed. Yep, she laughed. I tried to stay as calm as possible and told her that, were her dog be a bigger one, I would have a serious injury. This was NOT ok. She shrugged it off and continued walking.  I just couldn't believe it."

They weren't so keen at letting the french get a piece of their own country, they left during the referendums, leaving a token legal HQ in Montreal.  The biggest Bank in Montreal is now the National Bank of Canada, founded by the early french business community in the late 19th century. CEO and board are overwhelmingly francophone.  As you can see, les deux solitudes is also prevalent in the business world."

Most people don't search the sub before asking and some questions do come back so often, they do get downvoted for their annoyance factor. i.e. I don't speak french can I live/work/breathe/exist in Montreal. or what'S that sound I heard at 10pm on Wednesdays and/or Saturdays during summer, sounded like multiple little explosion with flashes in the sky. Sports, ain't that popular in here. Seriously, some question are just dumb a quick look at our all mighty ruler Google will get you the answers. Although most Montrealers are quite harsh on their city, we do all love it a lot. Which means that if you're here to bitch on the city, most redditor will defend it.... by downvoting you.

montreal,3c7c8n,Omnicharge,2,Sun Jul 5 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"Downvoting is a problem.  I was told to ""STFU because internet points don't matter"".  But unfortunately, they do matter.    For some reason, some mods think that the number of ""internet points"" is an indicator on the quality of the posts coming from a person.  If the ""internet points"" are low or under zero, most likely that person is posting spam, off topic crap or insults.  But the two aren't related.  A lot of the times, you get downvotes simply because your opinion isn't shared by the majority of the users.  But some mods still limit how much you can post based of those ""internet points"".  There's another sub where I can't post anymore because I kept getting downvoting there (only because I disagreed with the most popular opinion there).  I don't know what the solution is.  I wish people would downvote / upvote  based on the quality of the post, not on their own personal opinion.  But I don't think that's going to happen."

There's a big difference you know.  Like /u/Omnicharge said above.  If your question can be answered in a Google search then it's a down vote.  The interesting post in the end get the upvotes.    I think people are up voting/downtvoting based on quality.  It's the internet we'll never get everyone to agree on what is a quality post.  It's very much based on each individuals opinion."

There's a big difference you know.    I can't post because I was downvoted too much.  I think my score is at -15 now.  If I attempt to post, the system pretends that it worked but my post doesn't appear until a mod approves it.  It doesn't even inform you of this.  I can see my post if I'm logged in and I cannot see my post if I'm not logged in so you have to log out, refresh the page to notice that your post isn't there.  I'm guessing a lot of  other people have this issue without realizing it.    It often takes hours for the mod to approve the post (if he does).  He doesn't always approve it and I am not told why.  By the time my post appears, whatever conversation I was trying to have with other redditors has died down.  People have moved on to other things so my post is useless.  So the end result is that I can't discuss with the other redditors.  In other words, I can't post.  I tried to talk about this issue with the mods but I was shut down.  I was told I was acting in bad faith and that my opinions were controversial.  If I wanted to solve this problem, I had to find a way to improve my internet points (in other words, change my opinion to the opinion of the majority of the sub).    I think people are up voting/downtvoting based on quality.   My experience has been different.  You can take a look at my post history.  The posts that are downvoted are not bad quality.  They are on topic, respectful, and not done in bad faith like the mod said.  They just happen to have the wrong opinion."

It's mostly just hard work with no girls around but it has it's moments like when you hit thousand islands where you're suddenly surrounded by a hundred yachts on all sides. Suddenly for a few hours you might as well be on vacation.  My parents are rather well recognized in that industry (that's how I got the job despite the competition) and the crew knew that so they treated my quite well. I had the oppertunity to hang out on the bridge from time to time.   I remember one day where a yacht got a bit closer than we'd like and people scrambled to get on the radio to warn them away (those ships take kilometers to stop) and I guess the captain must have sensed me being slightly nervous. He just looks and me and says 'Don't worry, fiberglass against steel, steel wins every time'. His delivery was perfect and right then and there that was the high of comedy gold.  all in all it was a positive experience all around. I was lucky enough that the first year I did the job with my step brother. He eventually went on to make a career in that industry and he's first mate now. Gave me some much needed perspective on life, something I was sorely lacking at that age."

Your highways are littered with bottles, cans, paper, your Department of Transportation does not care about you? Your mayor no longer loves you neither?  Ah, Montreal, I loved you so much!

The British went with the ""pricier but lasting"" option for the Victoria bridge while the federal governement at the time went with the ""inexpensive but cheap"" one.  Champlain bridge is very difficult to maintain. It was not made to be maintained but to be replaced.   Victoria bridge on the other hand has been maintained and extensively modified over the years.  If you build your bridge to be maintained and you can apply the same construction techniques to keep it working, it's much better than building giant suspended reinforced concrete that will rust and deteriorate with time while not having any way to replace those.  Same with Jacques-Cartier. It predates Champlain by 20 years and we were able to replace the entire deck in 2002. No need to replace the whole bridge!  Having Champlain made of prestressed concrete was a stupid idea of the time. At least the superstructure of the new one will be in steel.  Oh and because they didn't have an ice breaking structure like Champlain, the British made the piers extra strong on Victoria bridge. So if the CN can just continue to take care of the concrete and replace deteriorating pieces, it could last for another 150 years."

Now, now, being a Republican (in the anti-monarchy sense) isn't the same thing as being a separatist, and as a separatist myself I would argue that we need to continue keeping the Queen as head of state (through her representative, in this case the LG of Quebec, who'd become the GG of Quebec) until we have a separate referendum on whether we should keep the monarchy or not.  The question is, what good reason is there for keeping the Queen (and soon the King) in the 21st century? Misplaced sentimentalism? Nostalgia for the Victorian era? Doesn't make much sense, if you ask me."
montreal,3c2kxk,archiesteel,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:10:27 2015 UTC,The good reason is that the legal tradition of having a monarch as head of state underpins our entire constitutional order.

What matters are the law, not the symbolic authority that  asserts it."
montreal,3c2kxk,archiesteel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:39:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I have to respectfully disagree - our constitution (specifically the BNA 1867) makes it extremely difficult to overhaul its legal framework, and would require the consent of a plurality of provincial governments -- which means any tinkering with the constitution also requires negotiations with the provinces -- and that means Meech Lake II. Seriously, this will make matters worse, not better. Sorry, it's just a bad idea.   Moreover, your suggestion of ""simply"" replacing the GG with a President also comes with a bundle of issues - how will this person be elected/appointed? What powers will they hold? If the step into the shoes of the GG but are freed of the obligation to act on behalf of the monarch (which is one thing that prevents an abuse of the GG's powers btw), you have just created the possibility of an elected dictator. This was tried before - in Germany, in 1933. It did not end well.  Also, it's not the Napoleonic code - it's the Civil Code of Quebec. It's very different from France's Napoleonic Code. And yes, it covers civil and property matters per s. 92 of the BNA, but all other matters (ie criminal law) are creatures of the Federal Government per s. 91 of the BNA."
montreal,3c2kxk,The_RAT,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:16:59 2015 UTC,"makes it extremely difficult to overhaul its legal framework, and would require the consent of a plurality of provincial governments    Oh, I never said it would be easy to pass, I'm saying that it's not in itself an argument in favor of keeping the monarchy. I'm also obviously not considering the problems of reopening the constitution with regards to the Quebec question. What I'm saying is that it doesn't need to be complex. It would be, but in a purely theoretical sense you could simply have a declaration (after getting the required majorities) that Canada is a sovereign Republic, but keep the same code of laws.   Moreover, your suggestion of ""simply"" replacing the GG with a President also comes with a bundle of issues - how will this person be elected/appointed? What powers will they hold?   You act as if anything of the sort had never been done before. You could simply have the prime minister appoint him and keep the protocolary role, or give him some powers, or give  him lots of power, that depends on the democratic debate that would be required (oh no, democracy!).  I'm not saying it would be done with a snap of the fingers, but it could be done. Of course, in reality Canada will likely remain locked in its system (good luck getting rid of the Senate!) until it becomes so dysfunctional that no one can deny it.   Also, it's not the Napoleonic code - it's the Civil Code of Quebec   ...based on the Napoleonic code. What that means is that existing laws were adapted into a new sovereign entity."

montreal,3c2kxk,archiesteel,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not too proud of Canada. It doesn't mean that I'm proud of Quebec either.  I grew up in Lasalle and before Bill 22, it was a given that immigrants went to Anglo schools in order to become Anglos. And why not? Nobody wants to be the underclass, and their insistence of remaining an underclass is always puzzling.  Bill 22 and Bill 101 pissed a lot of people, most especially immigrants who were denied their chance at a good life, and I was pissed at having French shoved down my throat, so as soon as I could manage, I fucked the fuck out of here.  I went around, in Ontario (both near Toronto and in the North), out west (Winnipeg and Vancouver), then came back to Ottawa.  This is when I realized what Canada really is, a place that simply does not have the character Quebec has. And the people, too, are not the same. I may have been contaminated by the Francos, but the more I lived with Anglos, the more I understood why Francos don't want anything to do with them.   Of course, this pissed me off even more; I mean, everyone is pissed-off when he discovers that hs is not the shit he thought he was.  I look at the political debates on /r/quebec and it just seems that the seppies have the best arguments; I mean, I see someone posting something, and I just cannot find anything to rebuke it.  I feel like I've been swindled into being roped into a big bunch of swindlers.  In my life, I have had many jobs where have been fucked and swindled by far more Canadians than Quebecers.  Then, when I was in English Canada, I had a better crack at many jobs just because I speak French. Then it dawned on my why  business owners loved me, and co-workers hated me: just having someone who speaks french in the company to deal with Quebec brings a lot of business.  Quebec has a big economy, and a lot of businesses, a lot more than one would normally think of, and it will happily deal with anyone, and just speaking French shows a lot more respect.  Of course, my co-workers hated me because they were rednecks who were too stupid to learn French, and although I am thoroughly Anglo, I've been  called a Frog more than once. It just proved that they're just a bunch of ignorant rednecks.  I came back because I had a job opportunity, and it dawned on me that life is so much better in Quebec. So I'm here to stay, even if Quebec separates. I won't  make the mistake of thinking it can't happen, because the political fortunes can swing very fast - who would have thought in 1993 that Quebec would pass within a breath of separating within the next two years??? In retrospect, feddies, as you say, are really a bunch of idiots, using brute force and money to fight what is essentially an idea.  Of course, you just can't undo a lifetime of experience and early upbrining; I do not really trust Francos to run a country, but having seen up close how Anglos do it, there's not much of a difference. Having seen how various governments are run within Canada, Quebec Civil Servants look the least stupid. You cannot imagine how much saying this pisses me off, because it goes so much against all the ""normal wisdom"". So I'll always have a grudge against the seppies for not being the arch-evils, and showing that we are not perfect.  Now you'll excuse me, but I'm going to the fireworks, and it's a long way by bus and metro to go there in time..."

They'd actually wait until someone filed a complaint to come fix it. We would put the cone in the hole and watch it dissapear. They'd do a shitty job covering it up, and it'd re-open every year.  On my new street in Verdun, last year they dug up peices of sidewalk and appartment land every few metres down the whole street. Then they covered it up in dirt and left it that way for the winter. This summer they threw on some asphalt and it's not even level.  It's pathetic really. Havn't there been a bunch of stories of the contracted companies doing a sub par job so they'd be paid to come back and fix it?

Stop and have a pint or lunch on crescent st  Have a poutine somewhere, la banquise is popular. tourists also seems to like having smoked meat sandwiches at schwartzs  If you're somewhat active go to Atwater market, after on the other side of the canal is a bike rental place, rent a bike and bike to ile Notre dame and ile ste Helene, there's a man made beach/lake there if you want to take a break and cool off. You can bike the f1 track. Then go up to jacques Cartier bridge and bike back to the city, great views from up there. Then back to Atwater market along the canal either via demaisonneuve ave which takes you through all of downtown, it's a protected bike path the whole way, or you could return via the canal and old port.   If that sounds like a lot of work to you then just rent bixi bikes for the day and bike from Atwater market to old port or vice versa, it's 20 minutes one way, tops. It's all along the canal and it's a nice bike ride. As a tourist in the summer walk or bike, you don't see anything taking the metro.   If you're still looking for things to do you could take the metro to pie ix and visit the olympique stadium, olympique pool, biodome, insectarium, botanical garden, and there's a funicular to the top of the tower. Not something I recommend to most people but depends on your interests."

montreal,3c3edp,brawler,3,Sat Jul 4 11:14:00 2015 UTC,"My cellphone once dropped out of my pocket on a flight, and I realized it only while waiting at the baggage claim.  There was an airline desk close by, so I went and gave them my flight information and a description of the lost item.  They said they would contact me if they found it.  I received no call.  The airline was Air Canada.  It happened in Montreal, which is for all intents and purposes a busy airport.  Another time, I realized I had forgotten a book inside the aircraft.  By then I was almost out the airport's front doors.  I ran back in, found the first Air Canada employee I could run into, and explained the situation with my flight number, seat number, and a description of the book's cover.  She told me to wait here and ran into the employee area.  Minutes later, she came out yelling a triumphant ""Got it!"" and handed me my book.  This one happened in Victoria, which was a much more quiet and laid-back airport than Montreal.  Your best bet is to phone and speak to a human.  A human on the phone must give you an answer immediately.  An E-Mail can be ignored for a few days, forgotten, or otherwise dismissed with a form response that doesn't come close to answering your needs.  If they answer ""Call Company B"", say that you did and they told you to call Company A.

montreal,3c3edp,aircanuk,2,Sat Jul 4 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"Air France flights out of YUL turn back to CDG. If you forgot something on the aircraft and it wasn't discovered by the groomers after the flight (which is highly probable, some grooming consists of just changing pillows, fixing seatbelts, etc), it's possible your kit was still on the airplane when it returned to Paris. If the next passenger at your seat found it, it was probably handed to the crew and made it to the lost and found at Air France at Charles de Gaulle. If you manage to get through to the airline, ask if something was found on the YUL-CDG flight that same day, might be worth a shot."

montreal,3by1xt,i_ate_god,83,Fri Jul 3 12:43:40 2015 UTC,I don't see what the point of getting this subreddit involved in meta-reddit drama will achieve.
montreal,3by1xt,Sehs,32,Fri Jul 3 04:22:09 2015 UTC,"You and I have been around reddit just about as long. Do you remember anything of this scale ever happening against the admins? I think dismissing this as ""drama"" is to severely downplay it. That is a seriously huge list of major subreddits going down in protest. In five years I don't recall this many mods teaming up behind any cause against the admins. Not even close.  I'm not saying we must go private as well, I'm just saying dismissing it as pesky ""drama"" is really shortsighted. Personally I think reddit needs to die, or at least get some competition. So I don't mind a bit of protest to stir things up. Reddit has accumulated some fundamental problems with how it's governed. Apathy, bias, and actually significant corruption is getting out of control... if this is news to anyone then you really haven't been paying attention (which is okay, just don't dismiss it as childish drama)."
montreal,3by1xt,Zulban,4,Fri Jul 3 05:59:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know, maybe I don't pay attention to these things much because I tend to spend most of my time on some specific smaller or medium sized subs.   I guess I can understand why /r/IAmA and some other subreddits went private but I'm not sure I understand/agree with this ""solidarity"" with other subs concept. Maybe I'm just being selfish and don't want my subs to go private so I can still access them.  I wouldn't really mind competition or whatnot either. Ultimately the main reason I got into reddit was because digg turned to shit. I stay out of the bigger subreddits because they're going that way as well but I've always assumed that would happen with the increased traffic and volume."
montreal,3by1xt,Sehs,2,Fri Jul 3 13:51:52 2015 UTC,Yes. I hardly subscribe to any subreddits with more than 100k subscribers. So I too definitely avoid all of this shit.  It's easy to imagine though that the reason larger subreddits are a shitshow is because the lack of moderator tools and admin apathy that everyone is complaining about.
montreal,3by1xt,Zulban,2,Fri Jul 3 16:53:04 2015 UTC,"Hey Sir! (It's Charles)  I agree with this, how reddit needs competition and https://voat.co/ just isn't enough. Reddit needs to change how they work internally and allow for better community control, but not censorship."
montreal,3by1xt,CraftThatBlock,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"Indeed! Sup Charles.  I suspect reddit's internal culture is not going to change, especially with continued corporate pressures to turn it into something nobody wants. So it's a technical problem, not a policy problem, because all policies can be dissolved with bad leadership. I think the only real solution here is where the platform itself does not allow this kind of centralized apathy, censorship, and corruption. But I don't see any reddit alternatives that are decentralized and even half decent. Voat could be nice but because they're just as centralized as reddit I have no faith that they'll maintain who they are today if they grow as big as reddit."

I don't think it's meta-reddit drama so much as a revolt against really bad community management, a lack of tools to actually run subs with a large userbase, and an underappreciation of the (volunteer) mods and userbase.    Then again if I worked somewhere and our users were constantly like ""Fuck u CHairmain PAO!""

We all know if Victoria was a guy nobody would be giving a shit. In fact, a similarly popular admin was fired weeks ago and it was barely a blip on the radar. This whole hoopla is the perfect epitome of Reddit's white knight syndrome.  I'm sure it sucks for those who worked with her regularly and enjoyed working with her, but it ends there. For random users to be turning around and pretending like this girl changed their lives forever is bordering on bizarre and is definitely very, very creepy.

montreal,3bv6bq,BanksKnowsBest,19,Thu Jul 2 12:24:12 2015 UTC,"What will always grind my gears about this is that Quebec said no to spending about $25m on a new park, which Claude Brochu claimed could be paid back by increasing taxes on visiting players. They were that close. Quebec actually changed their minds (they were going to take the money out of the tourism budget) when it became clear the team was going to move if they didn't, but in the meantime Brochu had sold for Loria, Loria wanted a LOT more public money and the team started their death spiral.  I'm from San Francisco and our baseball team built their park without public money and it's obviously the right way to go. The Bell Centre was also privately funded.  BUT...  Since then, Quebec and Montreal have spent millions - way more than the money needed for Labatt Park - on renovations for Stade Saputo and Molson Stadium, and Quebec ponied up TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a hockey arena that might never host an NHL team. They are thinking of spending FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS to replace the roof on the Big O, a stadium that is a decrepit shithole and a bona-fide team killer - forget the Spos, the Als folded twice and would have folded a third time if it wasn't for the famous U2 concert.  Don't forget the subsidies paid every year to Bernie Ecclestone so the Grand Prix stays - i think that's at least 12 million bucks.  So there's no goddamn principles here. None. Quebec is in the business of paying for your sports venture, they just got religion for the first and only time at the worst time.   Now, especially if there's a Liberal government, they will probably pay 20 times what they could have paid to get a team back. The city will be better for it, there will be increased tourism and awareness of Montreal, and that's all great. The Expos were my favourite team so I'd be delighted to have them back. But they could have had that for so, so, so much less. It's really one of the dumbest, most stupid and poorly thought out decisions maybe in the history of the province. It's actually the living exemplar of the one really good reason for governments to pay for stadiums: That if they have leverage (like Washington, DC), they can use it, you lose your team, and then to get them back you pay many times what you were asked for in the first place."

montreal,3bv6bq,Jerry_Hat-Trick,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:28:11 2015 UTC,"$200m is the cost of the entire stadium, the Expos were to pay some and all the cost overruns, Labatt were paying something like a quarter of that, the city of Montreal were chipping in some money. $25m from the province was the last brick in the wall.

I'm not exaggerating, a new roof is 400 million with no other changes (and the list of what's wrong under the roof is not short), and that's like two thirds of the cost of a downtown park."

The only reason they're doing this is because they don't understand a sunk cost, there is delusion on both sides of the aisle that if they keep pouring money into the dump eventually people will want to go to it. The Impact don't want to play there unless it's freezing or they can get 40K. The Als don't want to play there unless it's a playoff game. Baseball will never return there unless it's as a temporary home while a new stadium is being built. any big concerts could easily be hosted at a baseball park, heck the Impact could play their big games there. Conventions can go to the Palais des Congres.   The only legit reason for keeping it up is that Pie-IX and the stadium are one structural entity, but for $400m you would go a long way towards being able to demolish the place and preserve the Metro station."

Le 11 novembre 2014, Twitter a mandaté l’organisme féministe Women, Action, and the Media pour conduire une étude quantitative et empirique sur le harcèlement sur twitter mais aussi sur le gamergate, plus particulièrement sur une liste noire établis par Randi Harper, programmeuse autodidacte. Cette liste, au dire de Randi Harper, contient les pires harceleurs du Gamergate. La liste ggautoblocker (Good Game Autoblocker, nommé initialement Gamergate Autoblocker  et GooberGabber autoblocker), est construite selon le principe de « coupable par association ». Les membres de cette liste furent  ajoutés automatiquement s’ils ont suivi les comptes twitter des personnes suivantes : * @Nero * @FartToContinue * @PlayDangerously * @roguestargamez * @TheRalphRetort * @RealVivianJames * @CHOBITCOIN  @Nero est Milo Yiannapoulos, un journaliste pour le site de nouvelle en ligne breibart.com qui a exposé la liste GameJournoPros, un groupe google de journaliste vidéoludique ayant été utilisé pour faire pression sur différente publication indépendante l'une de l'autre pour maintenir une ligne éditorial homogène. @PlayDangerously est le compte de Mike Cervovich avocat et membre en bon et dû forme du barreau de l’État de Californie ayant écris plusieurs article très critique envers les opposants du gamergate. TheRalphRetort est le compte du blog pro gamergate du même nom et @RealVivianJames est le compte d’un partisan du gamergate. Seul les comptes @roguestargamez, @FartToContnue et @CHOBITCOIN furent suspendue par Twitter.  En se basant sur un échantillon 317 rapports d’harcèlement qui furent collecté du 6 novembre au 27 décembre 2014 et considéré comme authentique (genuine), 538 comptes twitter furent identifiés comme étant des comptes harcelant des gens.  En croisant les données récoltées et celle de Randi Harper avec sa liste ggautoblocker contenant 9844 comptes twitter, WAM a conclu que seulement 65 comptes  sont connectés à la controverse du gamergate, représentant 12 % des comptes provenant de l’échantillon (n=538). Les résultats de l’étude quantitative, révisé à l’aveugle par un comité des pairs de l’université de la Caroline du Nord et présidé par l’assistant-professeur Zeynep Tufekci, furent tellement dévastateur pour les opposants du gamergate que Kotaku, Polygon, Feminist Frequency, Brianna Wu et Zoe Quinn n’ont pas mis en lien le rapport sur leur site web, sur leurs comptes de média sociaux, commenter les résultats ou même signifier l’existence de l’étude.  Le rapport (pdf en lien) fut publié le 14 mai 2015. Seul Randi Harper (@freebsdgirl)  a réagis en tentant  de défendre la légitimité de sa liste noire (blacklist) mais avouant du même coup que la plupart du harcèlement sur twitter n’a rien à voir avec le gamergate, légitimant les résultats de l’étude.

Don't listen to what they're saying, if you succeed in starting a conversation with them. Just stare at their breasts while they talk. DON'T MAKE EYE CONTACT! Fondle yourself while you stare at their breasts. They will interpret this as you being sexually and intellectually attracted to them.  BE ALL THE MAN YOU CAN BE. Burp and fart in front of them, and re-arrange your balls constantly. Again, this arouses their atavistic tendancies.   Perhaps as a holdover from their medieval French ancestors, Montreal women would prefer that you not bathe. Rather, you should present yourself in a miasma of Axe deordorant.

I'm sure I'm going to offend someone but fuck it...  English girls are a little more prudish than the French girls and tend to be a bit more delicate. French girls like to flirt and banter a bit more whereas the anglos need warming up. I'd say ""crass vs class"" but that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The good parts of a mild crass vs the good parts of not trying to be classy but still are a little bit.  You'll find stunners in both groups. There's really pretty women here and they're not afraid to dress up and show themselves off. Even the 7/10 can look like a 9/10 with their confidence and preening skills.  Back before I was married I prefered to spend the evening with french girls while I was out partying. They're way more fun and english girls tend to be more work.   TL;DR Learn how to speak French."

Truth is, in this city, if you don't speak the same language, It won't matter how they are.  On the other hand, this is a multicultural city and girls don't walk around with a flag so you can identify their culture, nationality, religion or ""sex on the first day policies"".

But from a gamer's perspective this business model works really well. Gamers are satisfied because everyone is on an equal playing field and no one wins because they bought a weapon that is superior and the game costs $0 to pick up and try. There are quite a few more games that utilize this business model that are really successful as well such as DOTA2 and League of Legends. A lot of the prizes for major tournaments are 6-7 figures in size and a lot (if not all) the money comes from your everyday players buying skins.  My personal opinion a game would usually cost me $50-$70, so I don't mind paying for a few skins if a game is free to play and I'm having fun playing. I'm sure many others share the same sentiments. :)"

Go down to the swings at Place des Arts in spring (substitute for any swingset in a park if not spring/ near PdA). Push her on swing. Makeout after. Take to another park. Do the deed. Perfect first date, cost less than $10 too.  1st dates: Dive bar - real dive, not some young hipster crowd b.s. I like to set the bar low ;) Seriously, I like somewhere quiet, non-flashy, and a bit off the beaten path where we can talk and if things go well, make out discreetly (also run out for pizza and bring food back to bar). Cheap and no chance of bumping into friends. Some gals hate the joint, but that's fine, I'm not looking to date high maintenance. Either way, it hasn't failed me yet. Fuck popular bars until you're really seeing her. You can get interrupted, or she feels weird about getting touchy because she knows ppl there, or just dropping alot coin gets you a false positive.  Other ideas:  photowalk in Old Mtl, Chinatown, or Plateau  foodwalk in Chinatown, Little Italy, Little India, etc... Ethnic food markets are fun, too.  check out vintage clothing shops  skating  bar trivia night  ice cream in park   Freak Lunchbox  Laser Quest, miniputt, or bowling  Mt-Royal or Westmount lookout  free or cheap dance night (swing, salsa, etc) - go early for the lesson, make sure you've gone to a few so you're better than her but not too much, also you will look cool if know some of the regulars  Just my 2c's on bad early date ideas: movies (obviously) and concerts. You can't talk during concerts either - well ppl do but they're dicks. Go for drinks an hour or so before the show, then suggest the concert if things are going well."

Had a bottle of wine with wine glasses at the top, which I brought in a bookbag along with stuff to draw on, where we had competitions naming stuff and drawing what was on our minds. After this we went to ""crowed karaoke"" where instead of signing alone you sing as a whole crowd instead, so you can sing as much as an ass and not be embarrassed. After we went to mado's to watch a drag queen show and dance. I had a gift that I made by hand that was a joke gift at the end that made her laugh and not being able to speak or breathe."

She said she had learned during her 10 months in detention not to judge others, to take care of herself, and to rediscover her independence.  The board found that Porter had been a model prisoner, working in the kitchen and trying to learn French. It concluded that Porter was a low risk to reoffend, and an ideal candidate for gradual reintegration into society.

montreal,3bozc5,chiiaro,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:24:06 2015 UTC,Not always true. Sometimes it's easier to make the con prices cheaper because you're not paying shipping (and thus the customer isn't paying shipping.) Plus it's easier to charge 20 dollars a shirt rather than 22 on a website because who carries around 2 arbitrary dollars at a show like that?
montreal,3bozc5,MatchaJelly,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:25:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I always check prices before I buy anything ( Versus Online ) Plus even if it's 5-10$ more, it might be worth is since you do not have to pay for shipping times!"

montreal,3bozc5,MatchaJelly,2,Wed Jul 1 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yes I have, thank you. Their schedule isn't super descriptive though.  I'm not really interested in standing in line getting autographs, or cosplaying, so I was wondering how the other events (film showings, panels, etc) work, and if they're worth it! so I was hoping that anyone who's already been there in the past could tell me about them."
montreal,3bozc5,MatchaJelly,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:22:08 2015 UTC,"Con goer and volunteer for years. It really depends what your tastes are. If you don't like purchasing anything, nor cosplay nor paying for autographs, than you can do other things. There are a couple of video game studios setting up booths to you can play their games.  Also some panels are exclusive ( Meaning you need to pay a special ticket ) but the majority of them are free. My advice for you, is if there is a panel that you really want to go, I suggest you line up at least 20-30 minutes before it starts if you want good seats. I've attended some panels previous years, Gillian Anderson and the Reboot Panel. It's fun, plus if you go to panels about specific shows you like, you can meet a lot of new people who have the same interests as you."

My reasoning for supporting responsible public drinking is that bylaws are already in place against drunk loitering, littering, public urination and disturbing the peace, the only real inconveniences to residents and the general sober population.

Are the water fights going to stay away from the kiddy parks, dog parks, barbecue pits, baseball fields, tennis courts, soccer pitch, field bowling pits and volleyball courts?   Don't the people who want to use these unimpeded deserve consideration as well?    What about the people who want to use it the week afterward when there is mess everywhere and torn up grass from thousands of people tearing it up while its wet?

Les plaintes pour le bruit ont commencé subitement après que les deux voisins aient cohabités harmonieusement longtemps. Qu'est-ce qui a changé pour que ça se produise? Le DO a-t-il augmenté la quantité de son produit sans augmenter conséquemment l'isolation sonore? La locataire a-t-elle subitement pété un câble et décidé que le son ne lui convenait plus? Y a-t-il eu des pourparlers entre les deux parties avant de faire entrer police et amandes dans l'histoire? Est-ce que le DO a rejeté les demandes de la locataire cavalièrement? Ces demandes étaient-elles déraisonnables? Les articles ne disent rien de tout ça. Avant de blâmer un ou l'autre des antagonistes, plus d'informations sont nécessaires.  Maintenant, sans blâmer quiconque (en l'absence d'informations suffisantes), espérons que :   Le déménagement de la plaignante règle le dossier définitivement  Le DO ne soit plus la cible de plainte pour le bruit.

De ce que j'ai lu et entendu, plusieurs tentatives d'ententes et de compromis ont été faites, mais sans grand succès. Le Divan Orange a même loué le premier étage afin qu'il ne soit plus vacant et a procédé déjà à des modifications afin d'amoindrir le son, mais les plaintes se sont poursuivies.

Here's an open letter from the borough councillor to the tenant: https://www.facebook.com/notes/915944688416644/  To summarize: What changed was that the second floor tenants moved out and that floor was left completely empty. Suddenly the 3rd floor tenant heard the noise from DO. Also, she started living in couple around the time the complaints started, so it may have been him who was bothered more; hard to say, because he refused to talk to anyone (DO, the borough councilors who had to waste time on this shit, etc) about it, justifying his obstinacy by saying it wasn't his name on the lease. (Already you get a sense of who wasn't playing ball fairly, right?)  DO rejected no demands; she did. For months she refused to move, even though DO offered to fully pay her moving costs plus put her up in at a house if need be temporarily at no cost, and the DO literally searched the classifieds for available apartments on her behalf, plus found a new tenant to make sure the landlord didn't lose rent. She refused to move. She refused to even consider that.  She finally saw the light of day when the borough told her that it could much worse; whatever happened, the space would still be a bar, and the next bar could play techno, or be run by bikers, etc. (Seriously, the DO has a slightly older, cultured crowd, as peaceful as any you'll find at a bar - and they don't even stay til close most nights.)  Seriously, this woman was stubborn and stupid beyond belief. No one person should have that much power to inflict such harm on a commerce, especially a cultural commerce, ever again."

They turned the sound down, booked quieter acts, made sure people didn't linger outside the door - made no damn difference. She kept calling in complaints. I heard on good authority that on at least one occasion she called in the early evening, before shows even started, to complain that they made noise moving kegs or equipment.  She (or her shadowy boyfriend who moved in right when complaints began) was hellbent on driving them out of business. Did you read the letter from the borough councillor? It makes it very clear who was at fault. Even the borough realized the dispute was one-sided at a certain point and basically told her in not so many words that DO wasn't going anywhere, so she'd better."

Bumble bees don't chew, so they are likely coming in through a hole through the night (they are attracted to strong sources of light).

For every one that gets through, there may be 2-3 who don't because they're just nuts.  It's only representative of the community if you think the Gazette is publishing these to be representative, which I would argue is false. They publish letters like these because they're told (by flawed market research) that this is what the audience wants.  The Gazette could be any kind of newspaper it wanted to be if not for the fact its run by old people and administered by Post Media.

Saratoga a small town that feels very special because they have a horse racing track and a few very wealthy families. It is a tiny town in upstate NY that has high end fashion retail shops and over-priced restaurants catering to tourists that come for racing season.  The rest of the year, it's a very dull and boring place.  The locals rave about their art and culture, but it's lacking substance and soul. Saratogians tend to have a very safe and sheltered lifestyle. Skateboarding is illegal in the city; the police are omni-present; and the poor are segregated far from the city center.  He's obviously used to being kowtowed to by the local high school kids who are hoping for a big tip to supplement their meager hourly wage in the Starbucks and don't want to lose thier jobs before the track season when they will make a ton of money from wealthy tourists and gamblers who may have won big earlier. And seriously, Longueuil? Did he take a bus to Montréal and decide since the terminal was here, this must be the city? I apologize for my fellow New Yorker's lousy attitude.

To me, it sounds like your experience depends a lot less on the language of communication, and more on how you are as a person with the employees that are serving you, and/or how promptly you interpret people's reactions in combination with a tendancy to take things personally.  Honestly, going to a place where you don't speak the language can be daunting, and I wouldn't be surprised if our onboard defense system is to automatically instill fear in our brains for our protection when someone seems to be unable to communicate with us.

And like many stereotypes, the few bring the larger majority down. Surely you've heard some of the crap the rest of North America says about Quebec too, eh? Stereotypes suck and shouldn't define any group of people.  And to elaborate on tourists, because the subject is interesting, it's widely known that if you speak English, you can pretty much visit anywhere you want around the globe. Now that's a blanket statement, as obviously you'd want to at least have a try at the local language, but this is the type of information that's fed to tourists. And speaking as an American in Quebec, it's less the French language that's the culture shock as it is the ""lack of English."" I put that in quotes because it's incredibly false here in Montreal. But when I first moved here, I was being brought in to work in English. I knew of the English Universities in existence here that teach in English. I knew of all of the global industries here that work in English. I knew Canada's national languages included English. So it was quite the culture shock to find that there were instances where it wasn't known or even wanted in some cases. Generally when you visit another country, you don't take into account the rules of the state/province/town; just the country.  Anyway, it's a moot point for the dude in this example.

We already have a arena and the price of a team is a bit less.   -25 Baseball is not a well sought after sport here, except for the mayors.

The path between Le 1000 and Place-des-Arts (approx 4.5km roundtrip) is practically empty after 9pm, and cars definitely wouldn't be an issue there (and neither would the weather).

Runners have just as much a right to be there as anyone else, and someone might as well use it. If you are wearing reflective clothing or a light you are doing your part to keep yourself and cyclists safe.  Not to mention how some cyclists bike at like 10k/hr anyway (re: Bixis).   And this is my opinion as a cyclist. You should have a front light AND a bell on your bike. Use them."

montreal,3bd5gc,ducbo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:00:01 2015 UTC,"Unlike most other paths in Montréal, the Lachine canal path isn't exclusively for cyclists. It's a shared pedestrian/skating/dog-walking/bike path and there's also a speed limit for cyclists. So unless the cyclist is speeding or the runner isn't visible, then sharing the path shouldn't put either in danger."
montreal,3bd5gc,iqaluit,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"There are several examples of bike paths in Montréal that are designated to be shared between cyclists and pedestrians. The path along Cote des Neiges cemetery, for instance.  At least in 2014 the Lachine Canal path was shared, I believe."
montreal,3bd5gc,Hemiltonne,2,Mon Jun 29 00:46:42 2015 UTC,"Just to add to this: Run against traffic, like any self respecting pedestrian should. Too many runners seem to be completely ignorant to this concept and endanger themselves and others when running on bike paths."

montreal,3bd5gc,azertyasdf,2,Sun Jun 28 13:02:14 2015 UTC,"Pedestrians walking in any road are supposed to walk against traffic. If gives them a view of oncoming cars and an opportunity to sidestep to safety if need be. This is extra important when doing so late at night where drivers are less likely to see you.   I'm not sure if this isn't taught in Quebec or something, but it's common sense in so many other places and I see it practiced there. Here people just look at you funny.  On a bike path, runners are essentially just obstacles to be dodged. The lanes aren't wide enough to squeeze by, especially if one of the parties has no idea you're even there. Running with loud music blaring and no visibility of what fast moving objects are coming up behind you is foolish even when it's daylight. But it's just downright stupid in the dark. You might as well just go stand in the middle of a road with your eyes closed and see how well that works for you.  If you're a runner I just suggest you try it once and see for yourself. I do this and happily yield to every oncoming cyclist that I see coming from a mile away. I usually have ample time to look around me and assess the situation for any danger."
montreal,3bd5gc,daiz-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"Except a bike path isn't a road. Trust me, I've been running on the bike path for two decades and it's insane to try to run against the direction of bike traffic. At a lot of points, the path is too narrow to step aside, so going against traffic would force me directly into the path of a biker.  For a good part of the Canal, I'm able to run on the dirt path alongside the asphalt path. But at a lot of points (bridges, underpasses, etc.) I have no choice but to run on the asphalt. And if that's the case, I'd much rather be running with traffic than against it.  And for the record, when I'm doing a tempo workout I'm running about 3:45 mins/km - which translates to about 16 km/h, which is only slightly below the speed limit for cyclists, which is 20 km/h. So a biker who is obeying the speed limit shouldn't have much trouble safely passing me if we're heading in the same direction. But if we're going the opposite direction, the reaction time would be dramatically reduced.  And as I said, I've been doing this for two decades (as often as not, in the dark) - and not a single accident - not even close."
montreal,3bd5gc,Gorrest-Fump,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:31:51 2015 UTC,"It's because cyclists approaching from behind won't have to pass you, which puts them and you in a dangerous situation. And you can also see people coming head-on, and adjust yourself accordingly."

Hint: that's you the runner. Thanks for making my bike ride even more dangerous. Sidewalks are there for a reason (for your safety) and there are tons of quiet streets with empty sidewalks for you to run on if busy sidewalks are a buzzkill in your pursuit of your runners high.    TL;DLR version: running on the streets is dangerous and ignores the safety of others, so please use the sidewalk.

montreal,3bakct,Wolf99,5,Sat Jun 27 20:51:02 2015 UTC,"so much for the myth of bi or trilingual Europeans   The French (and to a certain extent the Spanish and the Italians) are notoriously bad in English. Everyone knows this. People usually refer to Germanic Europeans when it comes to bilingualism.  Unfortunately, a lot of people, particularly international students, do get stuck in the English ghetto. It's really sad. I kinda wish we could have a more uniform bilingualism in Montreal instead of West = English; East = French.

So I'd meet intl students and the Asians, esp if they went to a private language school, would be astounded that there was so much French here. Very weird, like the opposite of how Americans or Brits expect all French. But I guess it's in the interest of private ESL schools to misrepresent the French in the city. But I'm digressing...  The last year I've noticed alot of the Asians' profiles are asking for partners to speak French with. Almost half these days. Their profiles might even say they came for ESL, but want to learn French (and it's not like French is useful in their countries). That almost never happened a few years ago. French learning has also increased among Spanish speakers, too. So if that site's any bellweather, things are starting to change, intl students aren't as (McGill/Concordia) ghetto-ized as before."

montreal,3b8b3v,curiouscuriousmtl,7,Sat Jun 27 00:34:47 2015 UTC,It's mostly a population density thing.
montreal,3b8b3v,TurtleStrangulation,4,Sat Jun 27 02:03:57 2015 UTC,"No metro, no train, and dependent on an already congested highway. To me a project like this shouldn't be allowed to go through unless there's a clear public transit plan.  Vaudreuil makes more sense despite being further because at least it has a train station, the area they're proposing is completely isolated, it's going to be 6000 two car families."
montreal,3b8b3v,qwimjim,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:05:07 2015 UTC,"This area is a 15-20 minute drive from ST-JEAN NORTH, which is extremely far if you ask me. I have a buddy that lives there, and the closest pharmaprix is a 8 minute drive alone.  Most probably though, the people moving to these areas have jobs in the west-island instead of downtown...so in other words it's hardly the same crowd that frequents this subreddit. Either that or first time home owners who are itching to have their own yard and wouldn't mind the 1.5 hour commute to and fro."
montreal,3b8b3v,SmileyFacesx,3,Mon Jun 29 12:53:10 2015 UTC,"What fucking bullshit.  There's more than 3500 acres available for development, exactly 10 miles away from downtown, between highways 2-20, 40 and 13.  It's the land area of Dorval airport. Can you imagine how much that land is worth if it were redevelopped? You could house easily 100,000 people comfortably and affordably, while not being too far out. And think how it would help traffic without that big black hole that forces everything to go around it!  Close the noisy Dorval airport and move it to Mirabel, where it should have been 40 years ago. My parents live in St-Laurent, and I do not look forward to inherit the house, the airplane noise is just unbearable."
montreal,3b8b3v,StHenriPollWorker,5,Fri Jun 26 23:46:56 2015 UTC,"I live in bois-franc, and everyone who lives here got used to the planes within 2 weeks of moving here. Anyone who can't get used to it, well, why even consider moving here?"
montreal,3b8b3v,eraser34,0,Sat Jun 27 14:12:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair most people in bois franc are in condos so they spend a lot less time outdoors than someone in a house in saint Laurent who has a backyard. That said even in a small area like bois franc the difference in airplane noise can be huge, on/near thimmens the planes are sooooo loud, you are literally under their flight path. further north where the challenger golf course used to be the difference is night and day, much less airplane noise."

montreal,3b8b3v,LeFromageQc,0,Sat Jun 27 01:33:31 2015 UTC,Lol Mirabel was a complete failure. They should have built it in Vaudreuil.
montreal,3b8b3v,WesternSoul,3,Sat Jun 27 12:40:48 2015 UTC,"Mirabel's location wasn't really the issue that made it a failure, poor planning and management were."
montreal,3b8b3v,iqaluit,3,Sat Jun 27 14:36:27 2015 UTC,And the lack of high speed transit to access it (which was in the original plans and never completed)
montreal,3b8b3v,LeFromageQc,0,Sat Jun 27 15:24:28 2015 UTC,"No because most of the population of Montreal lives on the 13/15. It should have been built further south, Somewhere in Laval."
montreal,3b8b3v,qwimjim,0,Sun Jun 28 12:04:15 2015 UTC,It's impractical to move it to Mirabel; no one wants to drive 45 minutes (assuming little / no traffic) to get to the airport on highways that weren't designed for that much traffic.
montreal,3b8b3v,griffin8116,4,Tue Jun 30 12:31:24 2015 UTC,"to all naysayers about further development:  where do you live NOW, and what was it 300 years ago?  IMO, all of Canada should become habitable, but properly to co-exist with current habitat, and go full green , milk the foreign investors for all their money, put it into Canada's banks, and give back to ALL canadians."
montreal,3b8b3v,manlydishwasher,2,Fri Jun 26 20:46:39 2015 UTC,"OK fine for the development part. Milk foreign ""investors""? I guess you are talking about selling off land abroad and using the proceeds to finance govt spending? All this is doing is pushing the problem onto your kids. The moment you sell off land to investors they want a return. That return comes from extracting economic rent in perpetuity."

Great to see Montreal adding to it's housing stock.  Would be great if they opened up strips to have people self-build with guaranteed amenities (water / electricity / phone / road), naturally to be subject to building tax just like other properties."
montreal,3b8b3v,benfitzg,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:30:36 2015 UTC,"This is so sad. It's already completely congested around there to get to the 40. This is just going to make things worst for everyone and everything. More green space going away, more charm being destroyed. Montreal should be better than that. Make mass transit better and let people go off island. On island is at capacity already."
montreal,3b8b3v,tjgmarantz,5,Fri Jun 26 20:58:20 2015 UTC,I would counter that urabn sprawl is even worst. We are eating away at valuable farmland so that people can have home with yards. it is sad to see the last of the farm lands disappear from the island. But let's not send the families even further away. The Mass transit needs to be improved on the island first before permitting more people to move even further away.
montreal,3b8b3v,antitoaster,7,Fri Jun 26 21:12:32 2015 UTC,"This is urban sprawl.  Sure, it's on the island, but it's as far away from downtown than fucking Blainville."
montreal,3b8b3v,tjgmarantz,3,Fri Jun 26 22:14:54 2015 UTC,As the crow flies maybe but I don't have a crow big enough yet. It's the same time to get from downtown to Blainville so I'd rather it expands there. More room.
montreal,3b8b3v,TurtleStrangulation,4,Sat Jun 27 01:00:43 2015 UTC,"This is urban sprawl, because this new development in Pierrefonds-Ouest will be even more car dependant than some new developments in fucking Mirabel.  How about we focus on developing areas near existing transit first instead? It's not like we're running out of space on the island just yet. Green spaces and ecosystems, on the other hand..."
montreal,3b8b3v,StandingSt1ll,4,Sat Jun 27 02:11:03 2015 UTC,"Of course, we can't get parkland or farmland back from housing developments. However, there is a certain balance to be considered, seeing as the entire Montreal area is pretty much built on fertile land.  That being said, I just hope that whatever the outcome is, it will be backed on lengthy studies on that balance. Where I live in Laval, the recent massive developments haven't been backed by studies on how to do them intelligently at all (Vaillancourt being who he was). As a result, pedestrian access is limited and traffic is atrocious. The worst thing is, that voluntary lack of foresight is now permanent.  To me, it seems as if this new project is being handled much better that anything in Laval in the last 20 years in terms of planning, so we've got that going. No reason to become complacent and accept a half-assed plan, though.  I just hope they'll take more time to look into it, because the transportation aspect is also not really simple, what with the enormous distance with the Deux-Montagnes line and Hwy 40."

montreal,3b8b3v,Prof_G,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:42:50 2015 UTC,je pense seulement les terres agricoles qui ne font pas partie du parc.
montreal,3b8b3v,TurtleStrangulation,4,Fri Jun 26 21:08:46 2015 UTC,I rather see them buildup more on the island to retain families then having people more to the 2nd or 3rd ring and really stress the road networks. At the least it might give more of an incentive to the MUC to offer more mass transit for the West-Island.
montreal,3b8b3v,smacksaw,3,Fri Jun 26 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous to call this urban sprawl, it's on the island,   Sprawl is not the location, it's the design choice."

montreal,3b6uj0,GotNoob,9,Fri Jun 26 13:15:12 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about how St-Jean festivities have developed in Montreal and Quebec City over the past 5 years.  I went to the festivities in Quebec City this year and it sucked.  I was in Quebec for the Summit of the Americas in 2001 and the atmosphere was similar: cops and barricades everywhere.  Cops barking orders at you, multiple friskings, people being randomly dragged off the streets, vans full of riot cops speeding around town.  It was really, really weird.  Anyway, Montreal also decided make St-Jean more 'family-friendly', and also sucked all the fun out of the festivities.  The difference is that celebrations in Montreal decentralized down to neighbourhood parties, and now I think St-Jean here is better than before.  I just wish they wouldn't finish the party so early  What do you think?  Also - how was the switch to downtown for the main show this year?"
montreal,3b6uj0,bopollo,13,Fri Jun 26 13:26:55 2015 UTC,"All I can say is that Regis Labaume wanted a more ""family oriented"" thing (lets not talk about the bars making money now because of the no beer rule in the streets, etc).  I remember very clearly one year, we did the Saint-Jean in Quebec on the 23rd, then on the 24th we were in Montreal and went to Maisonneuve for the party...at 10:30-10:45pm.....And the police was emptying the park.  It was already over.  that was weird.  now they close much later.  Saint-Jean was EPIC in Quebec.  now its shit.  I'm never going back.  The plaines were full, the streets were full, no one was IN the bars.  Best times ever.  The crowds were crazy.  Now its empty.  They say on TV its because of the weather.  Total lies.  I remember torrential rain and people not caring.  Still packed.  Its a trend.  Every medium sized town to big cities are doing the same.  more policing, more afternoon stuff, fireworks, then go home.  I dont know why, but it kinda sucks.  I don't really party anymore, I just set off the fireworks now :P"
montreal,3b6uj0,rivierafrank,10,Fri Jun 26 13:49:48 2015 UTC,"The official celebrations are in the image of the people who govern us. Mostly oppressive if you don't fit in their guidelines.  These two articles sum up how I feel about it.  The smaller, less official neighbourhood parties is where the authentic celebration is at.  Mind you, I was raised in a time where people partied hard during St-Jean. That's part of my culture. Half of what the St-Jean means to me is getting high/drunk out of your mind. Not saying that's a good thing, but that's been the case for a long time, and so is engrained in my culture. I don't think there's anything wrong with it a little decadence once in a while.

Even if it wasn't and you were using a closed/encrypted (WEP/WAP2) service, this only protects the data between your laptop and the access point (at least, in theory).  In both cases, the data going up to the internet once at the access point is, for the most part, unprotected.  WiFi/ethernet/free/paid/etc, it's best to always assume someone can look at your traffic - you can mitigate against that by using secure protocols such as HTTPS when web browsing."

montreal,3b4317,cyborganism,4,Fri Jun 26 18:13:39 2015 UTC,"I was actually talking about personal experience.  I worked for Leger Marketing in the early 2000s. I had to do surveys with tourists around old Montreal. Those were the most frequent responses from these groups of people.  The French weren't SO bad, but the younger adult male Americans were outright insulting in their comments. They were all about the strip clubs and hookers and bars and yelling at almost every pretty girl on the street.  The older couples were nice however and were more interested in the culture, architecture, food, y'know, the regular tourist stuff."

I think it's an easy choice because of the familiarity and ease of the language, and at the same time, they enjoyed it because it's a lot more relaxed and laissez-faire, people were very nice and easygoing."

I'm sure the heavy quebecer accent can be a bit hard at first but I havn't encountered it that badly in the main areas of the city at least.  But anyway, I meant more when they're planning on traveling here they probably think, oh well same language, won't be as hard.' Sort of the same reason I picked france for an easy vacation as well."

montreal,3b4317,raverbashing,2,Fri Jun 26 03:26:37 2015 UTC,"This explained in part why Americans spend only 4 days in Montréal, while the French spend 13 days on average. One will visit more than one city during their trip, while the other one might stay only in Montréal."
montreal,3b4317,mtlpat,12,Fri Jun 26 12:17:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, it probably has more to do with the fact that the French are buying rather expensive airline tickets and therefore want to stay longer and get more ""value"" out of those tickets. Most Americans who visit Montreal are from NY/New England and just drive up for a few days."
montreal,3b4317,groshreez,2,Fri Jun 26 13:14:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 4 days is a long weekend, take some days off and you're good  You don't want to blow an expensive ticket to stay only for 4 days"

montreal,3b4317,Sehs,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:36:53 2015 UTC,I'm sure Americans spend less days in Montreal because they have far fewer vacation days compared to the French and would rather make a trip to Montreal a long weekend stay.

The core of the cities might be comparable though. Even Boston has an urban area of 4,600 km2."
montreal,3b4317,raverbashing,4,Fri Jun 26 13:51:27 2015 UTC,"There's only 4 American cities with more population than Montreal.  You are right about the sprawl, the density of Montreal also makes it different than most American cities."

Edit: precision."
montreal,3b545v,Gorrest-Fump,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:11:08 2015 UTC,"It is not.   Both Scotland and England use(d) rampant lions in their royal heraldry. The English lions are older than the Scottish union, and in the case of any British heraldry or successor heraldry, the lions are always meant to signify England in union with something else. In this case Quebec.  It is not an association with the royal arms of Scotland anyways, it's not facing the right way."
