mildyinteresting,3e04cj,mrob2738,-3,Tue Jul 21 05:42:34 2015 UTC,Picks should be used so their edge is aligned with the string!   You must not be a guitarist
mildyinteresting,3e04cj,schectersix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:20:26 2015 UTC,Oh my god you must be a fucking idiot if you don't understand what he was saying
mildyinteresting,3e04cj,Doyle524,4,Tue Jul 21 09:16:04 2015 UTC,"Yes he was saying that the only way to hold a pick is parallel with the strings but any angle of pickslanting is acceptable because all angles produce different tones and can affect your picking speed. I know he was joking though.  Edit: for reference the best angle imo   If the guitar above the door had the pick like this it wouldn't sound as  good as when a human strums it because when you play a chord with the pick angled like this, this reason it sounds good is because your hand and wrist are relaxed."
mildyinteresting,3e04cj,schectersix,2,Tue Jul 21 09:35:58 2015 UTC,You are 100% correct. Parallel hold makes it slightly more work

mildyinteresting,3ck3mk,DirkDieGurke,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:48:17 2015 UTC,If you can't afford full time employees with benefits while raking in billions and billions a year in profit clearly something is wrong with your spending habits.  If you don't want to pay at least some employees in management or higher positions a livable wage you're probably an asshole. And hate America.
mildyinteresting,3ck3mk,RiskyPenguin,8,Wed Jul 8 19:02:51 2015 UTC,"You clearly don't understand the relationship between franchisor and franchisee.  McDonald's will make their billions regardless.  The franchisee who bought the rights to operate a franchise, has to pay corporate McDonald's no matter what.  Corporate McDonald's raised the minimum wage to $10 in 2016 and it was the franchisees that had a problem with it.  Whether you like it or not, your local McDonald's is run as a small business that has to make decision when the cost of labor increases.  That means layoffs, smaller work forces and yes, kiosks that replace the workers completely."
mildyinteresting,3ck3mk,RiskyPenguin,-1,Wed Jul 8 19:37:07 2015 UTC,"No, I don't have any education in business operations.

mildyinteresting,3ck3mk,RiskyPenguin,2,Wed Jul 8 20:05:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  McDonald's only sold the rights to the model.  It's up to the franchisee, not McDonald's, to manage labor costs.  Local McDonald's have been closing like crazy lately."
mildyinteresting,3ck3mk,DirkDieGurke,-1,Wed Jul 8 20:15:56 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. The ones in my area are booming, you can't go a few miles without seeing one. That's why I'd assume it wouldn't be hard to give a higher base wage, but it would make sense that if they only come from individual location and not the franchise as a whole some couldn't operate under those conditions because of the amount of business they get.  But even so, I'm just not fond of the idea that anybody pushing a 40 hour week no matter the occupation can't afford a reasonable lifestyle. I understand that minimum wage varies from location to location and so does rent, goods and other things but I'm fairly certain I've seen articles on reddit many times about minimum wage not keeping up with inflation and things of that nature."

Eventually we're going to reach a point where technology will replace millions of low skilled jobs. And the reality is not everyone can obtain a job that pays well and gives benefits. Not under our current system at least it seems. It's going to be horrific for many families and people across America when this automation comes, there's no reason to call them whiners."

The current system keeps people down that want to stay under the system. If people want to take care of their families, they will make some effort to take any adult education classes that are available. There are government programs, and also community college. Just a few simple clerical skills can take a person out of the minimum wage cycle.  People need to stop whining, and start preparing."
mildyinteresting,3ck3mk,CaptainUnusual,2,Wed Jul 8 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with your overall message but realistically speaking some people's life circumstances won't allow them to push past the ceiling they're at.  It's going to take the effort of the population as a whole to find out how to fit in all the displaced workers from previous transportation and cashier/clerk positions. I'm not saying it's a bad thing that people are going to be forced to find a job with higher labor requirements, I'm just concerned that there won't be enough time or space to have everyone come in seamlessly without a large spike in unemployment occurring."

mildyinteresting,3ay4bu,yanggmd,10,Wed Jun 24 12:59:25 2015 UTC,"This is very interesting. I was thinking about how far you actually ran (it's not 4.75 miles) and it's a bit more complicated than I would have originally guessed. At first, I figured you could take the measured distance, then subtract the distance the boat travelled, but I don't think this would be correct.   Imagine if you were on a plane traveling at 500mph. If you decided to run up and down the isle for an hour and recorded it with your gps, you would just see your speed slightly increase and decrease as you were travelled along the flight path, but your average would still be 500mph, and distance would still be 500 miles (exactly the same as the plane). You didn't actually run 500 miles, but if you subtracted the distance your gps travelled from the distance the plane travelled during that same time, you would get zero. But you did run some distance.  This is going to take some more thought."
mildyinteresting,3ay4bu,illiller,2,Thu Jun 25 01:11:01 2015 UTC,Could you count the apparent revolutions and multiply it by the distance of one circuit?
mildyinteresting,3ay4bu,LlsworthToohey,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:13:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you could if you knew the size of one revolution. If I had to guess, OP ran around the deck of the ship or a running track, either of which is likely of a known, fixed length for exercising passengers.  However, without knowing the cruise ship, the company, or really any relevant details, it would be hard to guess. You could count pixels and make a rough approximation, but ain't nobody got time for that."
mildyinteresting,3ay4bu,AHemlockslie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:34:30 2015 UTC,"The typical length of a running track is 400 meters. There are tracks that are bigger but I would bet on this number, seeing as the boat can only fit so much track."

mildyinteresting,39hmyj,Bearfists,3,Thu Jun 11 20:06:37 2015 UTC,The large gray bags are what UPS uses to ship small packages and envelopes. Traditionally these bags are top loaded as to not be crushed. Whoever was loading an outbound truck thought that garbage can was a very convenient way to load these bags up right away instead of waiting for the top of his wall.

The symptoms of elevated potassium are nonspecific, and the condition is usually discovered on blood tests performed for another reason. Extreme hyperkalemia is a medical emergency due to the risk of potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia).  Temporary treatment can be given to reduce the risk of complications, but removal of the excess potassium by stimulating urine production or through dialysis is usually necessary.  Hypokalemia refers to the opposite condition, in which the concentration of potassium (K+) in the blood is low.

Four cases of pneumonic plague were found to have originated with an infected pit bull - a first in the U.S. Typically the disease is spread via bites from fleas carried by prairie dogs and other rodents, not from contact with household pets.  If the fourth case was caused by the man and not his pet, it would be the first time someone has contracted the plague from a fellow human since a Los Angeles outbreak in 1924, CDC researchers say.

mildyinteresting,33j5xe,dacheeze12,3,Wed Apr 22 23:03:53 2015 UTC,IIRC cans with compressed contents will undo themselves slightly to relieve pressure to prevent the side of the can splitting which would cause a dangerous release of the pressure.  Though normally the tab part of a drinks can goes first so impressive to see.

I think it's just an odd egg. If, however, the eggs were labeled backwards then my post proves your point I suppose."
mildyinteresting,33ec70,rabbifuente,7,Tue Apr 21 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"while i can't attest to that particular shade of yellow, i can say with great confidence that placed next to each other, free range eggs appear bright orange and store bought egg appears pale yellow. it might appear more yellow that you're accustomed to just because it's next to a more orange yolk."

mildyinteresting,33ec70,perceiver,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:16:03 2015 UTC,I grew up in Ontario and there the yolk was closer to the orange one from a store. When I moved out west I noticed the change in yolk colour more towards the pale yellow
mildyinteresting,33ec70,MichealJFoxy,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:41:30 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the feed, not necessarily the quality.  I was watching Chef's Table on Netflix and they got red yolks by feeding the chicken's peppers."

We do have a quota system I believe(Ontario) so mabye they have to store them for a long time anyway? We have 17 hens here and I have more eggs than I know what to do with, but it's great."

mildyinteresting,3379y0,Thon234,2,Mon Apr 20 17:34:29 2015 UTC,"Bézier curve:       A Bézier curve is a parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics and related fields. Generalizations of Bézier curves to higher dimensions are called Bézier surfaces, of which the Bézier triangle is a special case.  In vector graphics, Bézier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely. ""Paths"", as they are commonly referred to in image manipulation programs,  are combinations of linked Bézier curves. Paths are not bound by the limits of rasterized images and are intuitive to modify.  Bézier curves are also used in the time domain, particularly in animation and user interface  design. For example a Bézier curve can be used to specify the velocity over time of an object such as an icon moving from A to B, rather than simply moving at a fixed number of pixels per step. When animators or interface designers talk about the ""physics"" or ""feel"" of an operation, they may be referring to the particular Bézier curve used to control the velocity over time of the move in question.
