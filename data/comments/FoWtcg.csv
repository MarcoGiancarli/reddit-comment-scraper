(see TCGplayer - force-of-will/the-millennia-of-ages?issingles=true) I wouldn't bother buying 2, id get 1, then make trades for what you need.  The $43 or so box will net you 2 of each card inside I believe, including some staple cards like thunder, all dual lands, etc, being reprinted as commons."

You cannot rest a j/resonator on the turn it comes into play (your turn), but you may do so during your opponent's next turn rather than wait for your next turn. This includes using the j/resonator for blocking or for activated abilities that require resting."

FoWtcg,3e6c9o,Yoo1z,4,Wed Jul 22 08:11:00 2015 UTC,"The real metashifting cards are the red aoe spell and the white thunder in the alice starters coming next week.  MoA has a lot of nice cards, and honestly lumia is hugely underrated from what i've seen. Lumia resonator is going to see a lot of play as the meta settles for the simple fact shes the only 6/6 for two mana- and only one of those needs to be a white. The banish effect on her is just a bonus honestly.  But as i said, the cards that are really going to define the meta shift is the white thunder. That card will allow white to achieve a new level of freedom in deckbuilding since they wont have to splash red for thunder, and similarly whitethunder means control decks might swap their red for white- we'll see though.  But yeah, everyone knows that white is going to come out swinging, with initial spoilers i thought christie resonator was going to make elves amazing, but now with all the aoe that's actually coming out, and the fact white thunder gets around hexproof- im not sure if elves are going to become that much better.  Also susanowo. The fact that he can be sideboarded into anything to play in response to a blazer means that dragons are probably leaving the metagame- well probably not blazer, since he's nice just for the fact that he can keep coming back if not playing against green.  But yeah, susanowo and white thunder are probably the two cards that will force the largest changes to deck building with all these new cards."

Oddgro typically goes 1 drop into two 1 drops into either rapunzel representing lethal, oz grabbing a dreams, or more 1 drops. The reason why it is top tier is because it goes under so many decks in the format, putting consistent pressure with 16 one-drops and tempo cards + metagame finishers (Split Heaven and Earth).  I play both Liberator and Oddgro and out of the two, Oddgro is more consistent. Liberator has a powerful combo-kill consisting of Xeex + tons of small guys + J-Activate to find another Xeex + massive swing with tons of 600/600 small guys, but against Oddgro it has to stabilize and then hold up a counter for the Split that can just end the game instantly.

I won't order them from USA or UK as the shipping charges to Spain (and taxes on top of that if ordering from USA) make it not a feasible option. And I can't find any shop in Spain with:  -Access to singles and -Online service.   Hope that answers your question.
FoWtcg,3dxg6s,AntProtein,3,Mon Jul 20 11:10:07 2015 UTC,"Well, if that's the case I'd suggest buying two boxes of Vingolf Engage Knights.  You'll get a playset of every duel magic stone, playsets of several staple spells (such as thunder, stoned to death, and law of silence.), and you'll get a lot of cards to at least start building your deck.  From there I'd get Castle of Heavan packs, but you can buy whatever you want from the Grimm cluster, really."

FoWtcg,3dw3kk,ilovesmoking1,2,Mon Jul 20 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly instead of buying a box is just buy a deck from a broker you can find on the side of this subreddit, currently werewolves is seriously Agro and can do some awesome work and or Grimm fairy tails is good."
FoWtcg,3dw3kk,Nuclearwinterz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:01:20 2015 UTC,The set with some of the most Aggro cards is Crimson Moon Fairy Tale. Little Red Werewolves is a very common aggressive deck that you'll see in the format. For the exception of a playset of Thunder you could probably put the deck together on the cheap side I'd say between $40-$60. Another aggressive deck that I see a lot of people start out with is the Yellow Brick Road Deck using Crimson Girl in the Sky as the ruler. The majority of that comes from Castle of Heaven and the Two Towers set. Either way you can get a decent aggro deck out of a box of either set and if you dont get all the pieces you need you can trade the other stuff for what you need or want.
FoWtcg,3dw3kk,artplaystcgs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:26:09 2015 UTC,so should I buy the crimson moon fairy tail box ? if I'm trying to make an aggro deck
FoWtcg,3dw3kk,artplaystcgs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:33:45 2015 UTC,If you really want to you can. You can pull the majority of the deck core from one box. Thats what I got. The deck is also pretty cheap for the exception of Thunder. You could also wait ti check out the new starters or buy 1 or 2 of the Vingolf Deckbuilder Kits. Which come with 2 Thunder and 2 Stoning to Death.
FoWtcg,3dw3kk,DoubleSpoiler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:08:07 2015 UTC,"The new starter decks coming out this Friday are aggro. If you get 4 of them, I could see it being pretty powerful."
FoWtcg,3duskg,Sean6919,3,Sun Jul 19 18:03:57 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you're referring to an ability printed on the resonator you are blocking with. In this case if the ability would cause the resonator to become rested/tapped then you may not use the ability because the resonator must become rested in order to declare blockers. Therefore you may only do 1 or the other. If the ability however does not require you to tap the resonator then you may activate it after blocks are declared and before damage calculation.
FoWtcg,3duskg,CyanShock01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:36:27 2015 UTC,What happens if something is removed from the field before the damage happens?
FoWtcg,3duskg,MagicianLord,2,Sun Jul 19 20:56:20 2015 UTC,"If the blocker is removed from battle or the field before the Damage Resolution Step, then the attacking resonator will deal damage to the original intended recipient.  See Rule 8.5 - ""Normal Battle Resolution Step"" in the Comprehensive Rules."

FoWtcg,3duhcy,JdowT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:27:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly it really depends on your postal service. Distributors will try to ship it out so that people will get it the day of release but it all depends on it not being delayed by the postal service. So if everything goes smoothly it should be at your place on the release date, but stuff happens so it's never really 100%.  Also so far the cards are legal at the event."
FoWtcg,3duhcy,GrieVelorn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:26:11 2015 UTC,I just messaged Jim. Yes that set is legal.
FoWtcg,3dt962,Myrrodin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:03:36 2015 UTC,Yes. But I don't believe there is an official list of all the races. But there is this Wikia link that has pretty much all of them. http://force-of-will-tcg.wikia.com/wiki/Race  I am unsure the legality of Valhalla races being called on Moojdart.
FoWtcg,3dt962,GrieVelorn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:16:44 2015 UTC,"Well, there's nothing in the Comprehensive Rules regarding about calling a race from the Valhalla set, but then again, there's nothing about declaring a race that doesn't exist in the game. I was also told by one person (this not official ruling) that if it works like magic, you have to call a race that exists in the game."
FoWtcg,3dt962,LolitsaDaniel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:08:53 2015 UTC,"If you're using Moojdart's effect, you are most likely using it for a reason that pertains to specifically targeting a resonator that your opponent controls or you control, so you'd probably never want to make it any other race besides the one an effect you control affects.  If not, then there really is no point in playing Moojdart unless you get off on turning Wererabbits to Gnomes and shit."
FoWtcg,3dsomh,Nyte_Crawler,2,Sun Jul 19 02:07:44 2015 UTC,I was apart of the tournament. I believe it was a total of 84 players who participated in the tournament.

FoWtcg,3drs2d,Fiethsing,2,Sat Jul 18 20:54:33 2015 UTC,"My understanding (read: MTG rules) is yes, you can still block. The phases would go as such:  Declare attackers: Your opponent attacks with his resonator.  You respond by casting Fiethsing. It resolves, you prevent damage.  Proceed to declare blockers."
FoWtcg,3drs2d,UnderclassHeroX,2,Sat Jul 18 21:24:58 2015 UTC,yes you can still block. Resonators that are not rested are able to block hence putting them in the rested position !
FoWtcg,3drs2d,Yoo1z,-2,Sat Jul 18 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"If you quickcast Fiethsing in response to your opponent declaring an attacker, you will be able to take advantage of Fiethsing's second ability, which nullifies damage to a target resonator until end of turn.  You choose Fiethsing herself, and then during the Declare Blockers Step, you rest Fiethsing to block."

If you have played MTG, a FoW 'cluster' is the same as a Magic 'block', like Ravnica or Zendikar.   The Grimm Cluster will be tournament legal until September 2016 and contains the following sets:    Crimson Moon's Fairy Tale The Castle of Heaven and the Two Towers The Moon Priestess Returns Millennia of Ages (comes out next week)   Any cards from these sets are legal to play in tournaments right now.   The starter decks that released previously use a mechanic that is no longer in the game (referred to as Valhalla rules or the Life Break mechanic). You do not want of any of these original starter decks if you want to play in tournaments.   The new starter is the Alice Cluster starter deck. It should release next week and all cards will be tournament legal. This is the starter deck you want.   There is a reprint set coming out next week as well, Vingolf: Exchange Knights. This set will have a bunch of new cards and some very important reprints, including two of every dual stone (just like the original dual lands in magic).   My recommendation is to get one of the Alice Cluster starter to see if you like the gameplay, and if you do, immediately buy 1-2 of the Vingolf sets. Then you can buy packs or boxes from any of the other sets as you like."

For stones, go with 4 green red 4 black green 1 true green 1 mono green or gurubalesta. It's generally a control deck, so removal staples such as Thunder, Xeex and Flame of Outer World work well. Try to get a balance between control and aggro, so Camilla and Meph work well."

He will also be helpful to become a judge.  Now the answers. (to my best knowledge)  1- Yes, according to turn chase it would resolve that way  2- In FoW, the first sentence before a dot is also a cost, therefore you would rest(tap) as part of the cost, without a timing for your opponent to kill your resonator  3- Im guessing you are refering to rabbit kick, player A only needs 1 were-rabbit for it to return 2 resonators,  now this is an effect not a cost, so if player B is able to chase and kill both were-rabbits then player A would only be able to return 1. Different from question 2  4- Well the actual process would be more on the question side, player B should ask ""do you pass priority?"", or player A should ask ""does it resolve?"" to let know player B they have priority.  I do not have the answer to whether you rewind, lets hope Matt answers that one."

FoWtcg,3djrbe,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:29:48 2015 UTC,"There is currently no formalized  judge program in the U.S.  There is a ""rules advisor"" program that Matt Kozmor administers in person at the various official regionals and some Alternate Reality Games (a store sponsoring the game) tournaments.  You have to take the test in person.  If you pass, you become a Rules Advisor and will get information on the judge's program when it becomes available.  1) You are attacking with Gilles de Rais, so you are the turn player.   Per rules 6.1 and 6.2, two automatic abilities have triggered.  Turn player chooses a triggered ability he/she controls, resolves it, and repeats until he/she has none left to resolve.  Then, non-turn player does the same.    Rule 3.1 would make me think that if you use Gilles's ability first as the turn player, you've created a new ""object"" by going to the graveyard and back to the field (Gilles changed zones from graveyard back to field).  Thus, Dracula can't gain control of Gilles when your opponent resolves his trigger, since the old object is gone.  2) There is no errata on Inquisition, so it's ""rest recovered resonator"" clause is an effect that happens when it resolves.  Your opponent must do something to your resonators while Inquisition is in the Chase Area before it resolves to stop it.  A cost in a spell is represented by a colon (:), and that's not present on the card.    3) Same as question 2.  Your opponent must do something while Rabbit Kick is in the Chase Area before it resolves to interfere with your choice.  4) There are no formal rules governing this, but I would explicitly state to your opponent that you are holding priority after casting a spell, taking a valid action, activating an ability, etc.  In most card games I have seen played that has a priority mechanic, most players play one spell or effect at a time; not many want to hold priority to continue doing stuff.  Since it's more frequent to play one thing at a time than to do multiple things in these other cards games, it's better to explicitly state that you are holding priority.  I am not a familiar with the judging/penalties part of FoW, but I would imagine a judge would order a rewind action."
FoWtcg,3djrbe,MagicianLord,2,Thu Jul 16 23:48:48 2015 UTC,"Just chiming in on 1, this actually happened at the table next to me at the regional on saturday the turn player was dracula and killed gilles with bloodsucking impulse, and the other player was able to keep gilles by sac'ing stones, since his effect entered stack second as non-turn player, the judge said that essentially interactions like this work against the turn player."
FoWtcg,3djrbe,twinrhapsody,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:37:23 2015 UTC,"It works in the case you mentioned at the regionals per Rule 6.1 and 6.2.  However, if the turn player controls Gilles, I am still under the impression that Rule 3.1 would cause Gilles to become a new object.  So, even though the non-turn player's Dracula's ability would go second, the non-turn player still wouldn't get control.  If it was any other creature, Dracula would gain control of it."
FoWtcg,3djrbe,snethx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"This is a ""whose turn is it?"" issue. If it is the Dracula player's turn, the Gilles player's ""sac 3 stones"" trigger will RESOLVE first, and if they choose to do so, they keep their dragon. If it is the GILLES player's turn, DRACULA'S trigger will resolve first. Both effects are triggers that happen when the card goes to the graveyard, so if you want to steal the dragon, do it on your opponent's turn."

FoWtcg,3dj4oi,JdowT,2,Thu Jul 16 18:10:07 2015 UTC,The remove a resonator and return it?  1. Opponent targets a resonator. You chase the spell with DoJ to blink the guy and make the spell fizzle.  2. Opponent is attacking with a non-quickness resonator. You blink it with DoJ to stop its attack.  3. You need a surprise blocker.  4. You get another attack with Blazer by blinking him and attacking again.
FoWtcg,3dj4oi,CupcakeDaddy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"A surprise blocker? How exactly would that work? And how can blazer attack again, from swiftness?"
FoWtcg,3dj4oi,Radiant-Paladin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:40:19 2015 UTC,"When you blink a resonator with Dreams it re-enters unrested, so when they attack you can blink one of your rested resonators and be able to block with it. And yes to Blazer, for the same reason. It re- enters unrested and has swiftness, so it can attack again."
FoWtcg,3dj4oi,RazureSky,0,Thu Jul 16 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"Actually I think this is incorrect, according to section 3.1, If  a  card  moves  from  a  zone  to  another,  if  it  moves  from  playground  to playground, it's treated as a same card and keeps its orientation. Otherwise, it's treated as a new card in a new zone. If not specified, any effect applied in older  zone is not applied to the new card.   So it should record its orientation as the resonator leaves the field, and when it comes back it retains its orientation."
FoWtcg,3dj4oi,vampirialsin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:48:40 2015 UTC,The first part of that rule is for if the card goes from one instance of a zone to another instance of that zone without going into any other zones.  The main example of this is when a resonator is taken control of by the other player.  But for DoJ the card changes zone types twice (Field to Removed to Field).  By changing zones it gets reset.  (treated as a new card)  Also the new cards in vingolf: engage knights have abilities that trigger when ever they enter the field.  DoJ causes these abilities to activate when they re-enter the field.
FoWtcg,3dj4oi,Radiant-Paladin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:11:31 2015 UTC,"Also, if your going in for the kill, you can always attack, wait for them to block and then blink the blocker so the attack goes through. Won me a few games. You covered a good amount of what I use Dreams of Juliet for though. :)    The card is amazing. It deals with problematic additions, saves your guys from targeted removal and even if it is dead in a matchup you can always cycle it away."

FoWtcg,3dgymg,Radiant-Paladin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:19:51 2015 UTC,"Grimm and abdul can both play pretty well against her. Grimm just gets a strong opener that will sometimes push through pandora, then the tutor effect helps a lot in gaining consistancy on your draws, but its mostly based on the stregnth of your opener.  Abdul is capable of flipping before pandora which will allow you to prevent the discard altogether.  Schezerahade isnt too good against pandora though, you have one search/flip, and once you do you can bet your ass your jruler is getting instadeleted by flame of outerworld, so the tap draw 2 will never come into play.  Bahamut also plays strong against her, pandora hates bahamut as its both a combat jruler that can cause serious issues, and it also has a tutor effect. Imperishable rulers are something pandora hates since pandora wants to exhaust your opponent's resources quickly, but bahamut just keeps giving. Then the consistancy of being able to remove a t1 elf, as well as the raw power of the opener forces pandora to play on her toes the whole game.  Pandora is really strong, but its also arguably more dependant on the coinflip than any other deck right now, since going second exponentially slows your ramp since it opens up your opponent to more easily deal with priest/fiethsing."

FoWtcg,3da7p4,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:46:12 2015 UTC,"The new grimm resonator is likely to take the place of current grimm in most main decks, the pandora resonator is also possible to fit in, maybe as a 2 of in place of queen's butler, but probably not.  Then the thunder chant from the starter decks/alice cluster is also a pretty dang sweet card, albeit most grimmia already runs thunder though, so we'll see."
FoWtcg,3dcqlx,Nsgdoughboy,2,Wed Jul 15 06:28:57 2015 UTC,"Force of Will Inc. is certainly pushing the game hard to succeed.  The game is not even one year old in the U.S., and there are already tournaments and World Championship qualifiers for a free trip to Japan for the finals.   Very few new card games have the budget and volunteerism to get all these events going.  If you don't want to spend a lot of money on the game, then buy a Alice starter deck ($20) or one or two Vingolf sets ($35-$50 each) on July 24 and play casually at your LGS after a YuGiOh game.  By playing FoW at your LGS, you help provide visibility to the game and get other players interested.  That will keep the game going.  Nobody will really know how long FoW will last.  Ultimately, all of this is entertainment.  Do not think of this as ""investments.""  For example, you either spend $60 for a PS4/Xbox One game or spend it to get a few FoW cards or product."

I personally feel like the game would be tough as they are also competing with very old card games such as Yugioh and MTG.  However, I feel as if though the game itself has that very niche over these games.  It adopts similar mechanics to MTG such as the mana system, but it rounds out the edges by having the mana itself in a separate deck.  I also am coming down from Yugioh as the format precedes to become even more stale than it should be with nekroz bathing in the horizon of komoney's lack of a new ban list.  Too be honest, the game is extremely fun and I don't think I've ever played a more interesting game.  The competitive scene is very much control decks right now (since you play Yugioh I would refer them to the HAT format).  Through and through the game is young, but the things they do right rounds out their advantageous niche over other games and may perhaps make a lasting game for the future."
FoWtcg,3dcqlx,visualalias,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:28:10 2015 UTC,"It feels like it SHOULD last for a long time, but the longevity if the game is up to its creators, and the LGSs. The game is good enough to last, but with poor support from the devs and community, it won't last. It's not like vanguard, weiss, and buddy fight which had inherent flaws in their game design that made them tank."

FoWtcg,3db9oy,Dirthouse4lyf,2,Wed Jul 15 00:45:59 2015 UTC,No? The main color of the deck is darkness and there is only one stone that can't produce it. Yes sometimes you get screwed turn one but that's just card games. Not because the deck isn't consistent.
FoWtcg,3db6rf,VirusPWNZ,2,Tue Jul 14 22:33:05 2015 UTC,"The game is rather new so getting a community going will be a challenge in certain areas.  The key step would be finding a base to have people to play with.  Card wise, some decks require the use of multiple colored stones so picking up dual stones would be beneficial in order to make decks.  Staples are rather cheap compared to Yugioh but you do need four cards instead of the initial three.  Buying a box will net you some pretty nice cards for making a casual deck.  Rulers aren't that expensive either capping at $20 at most right now.    Mechanically the game is similar to magic and is quite easy to pick up.  I myself just recently retired from Yugioh and picked up this game and I don't think I'll look back.  The mechanics of the game feel way more balanced than Yugioh as power creep in Yugioh is constant, forcing players to buy the new cards and make old decks irrelevant in the new meta.  I never really liked how Yugioh allowed you to poop out your hand in one turn without punishment leaving your opponent with no counter play (I.e. Quilphorts).  FOW was a fresh breathe of air to that and I'm sure you'll love the game.  If you have any questions just ask!"
FoWtcg,3db6rf,visualalias,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:09:30 2015 UTC,"I've noticed how balanced it is. The fact that you gain hand size is mitigated by how slowly you cast stones.  I don't think I'll jump head first into the meta because of the people problem. There's only a few people at my YGO locals who play FoW, but almost all of the local stores at least carry booster boxes.  Thank you for your input!"

Certain staples are unlikely to change regardless of what cards come out in the future (until their rotated) like Gretel/Elvish Priest/Fiethsing and spell cards like Rapid Decay, Bind of Gravity, and Xeex are unlikely to drop in value either.  But more specific cards like finishers like Blazer and Mephistopheles (or aggro 1 drops, since better aggro resonators can always come into play pretty easily) are more likely to be replaced in future sets- for examples dragons are about to become utter shit with the release of the new set thanks to Susanowo- a 6 drop that is pretty darn strong for its cost, but then has an additional effect that says it costs 3 less if your opponent has a dragon- basically removing any reason to play a dragon from now on."

If you want something you can win your locals with yes, Little Red can be competitive. If you want something you could win a bigger tournament with, yes, Little Red can still be competitive. Every ruler has potential to top an event. It may be a difficult task and may take some luck in your matchups, but its possible. Heck, a Bloody Snow White deck made top8 at the Chicago regionals, one of the biggest FoW events ever.   The main problem with Little Red is most of the resonators she helps out get made worthless by abdul. You can either run protection like Breath of God to protect these resonators or you could try building a deck with big base creatures and pump spells to avoid that problem. Its all about what you want out of the deck.  I went 4-3-1 with Jeanne d'Arc at Chicago Regionals, (and I should have had another win at least if I played smarter), and no one really thinks Jeanne is very good.

FoWtcg,3d3s54,wkim564,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:09:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, this interaction works.  Rule 5.4 of the Comprehensive Rules governs the ""End Phase.""   ""At the beginning of end phase"" trigger conditions are happened. Turn player gains priority and perform priority sequence. ""At the end of turn"" trigger conditions are happened. Turn player gains priority and perform priority sequence. As a final step, all the following action is performed in this order:   a) All the damage on resonators or J-ruler becomes zero.  b) All the continuous effect applied until end of turn end.  c) All produced wills are cease to exist.  d) If turn player has any maximum hand size and he or she has more cards than that in his or her hand, choose any cards in his or her hand excess his or her maximum hand size and discard them.  e) If there are any rule process or any abilities triggered, perform priority sequence and repeat this final step again. Otherwise, finish this final step.   The player not the turn player becomes new turn player and start the new turn.     So, the detailed interaction is as follows:   Necronimcon's ability triggers ""at the end of turn"" and is put into the Chase Area.  Turn player (you) gets priority, but you pass. Non-turn player gets priority, per Rule 6 ""Priority Sequence"" and decides to play Dreams of Wonderland and targets your Feithsing.  Dreams of Wonderland is put into the Chase Area. Non-turn player passes. Turn player gets priority.  Turn player passes.  Non-turn player gains priority and also passes. The Chase Area begins to resolve, one spell or effect at a time. Dreams of Wonderland resolves.  Feithsing is returned to owner's hand, which happens to be the controller of Necronomicon (you). Turn player gains priority and passes.   Non-turn player gains priority and passes. The Chase Area begins to resolve, one spell or effect at a time. Necronomicon's ability resolves.  Necronomicon's controller (you) must discard his/her hand.  Since Feithsing is in your hand, you must discard it."

The main effect that this errata will have on gameplay is that [Enter] effects of cards cast through Lumia's ability do not happen.  The game design has changed, so that future cards will use the [Enter] keyword more sparingly.  It will be used on cards that have very powerful effects that the game creators don't want abused through zone-changing techniques.  ""Weaker"" effects will now use the ""When this card enters the [field|playground]"" wording structure.  Note that this wording change will also weaken Abdul's ability."

To block, the player chooses recovered J/resonator he or she control that can block the attacking card.  To block, rest a J/resonator non-turn player control other than attacked object. If he or she must perform any action to block, do it at this point. If he or she cannot, he or she may not do that block and rewind the game situation back to choose block or forfeit.

It seems like you get a Priority Sequence after your opponent forfeits blockers. That would mean you can cast Instants or use Abilities.   You can rest your Pure Stone for a bonus during the Draw Step, then use it again after it recovers during the Recovery Step. This strategy is a key reason people play Rapunzel.   13.2.

Meta is for chumps, play what you like, dude. otherwise youre just another douche who plays to win and not to have fun. but if you insist, Alice control, crimson girl/oz ramp. abdul necronomicon control (fuckign broken deck, i hate this shit so much) and theres a new set coming soon which starts the next meta block called the Alice Block.  We are currently on the Grimm block. any cards from Valhalla Blocks are not legal in EU, NA and any Asian country except Japan.

FoWtcg,3cxzsp,Yvelrai,2,Sat Jul 11 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"I have tried that same version of Lumia (WUB) and I love it. I run small draw creatures in blue (Cheshire cat, mermaid of tragic love). To take maximum advantage of the draw power running 4 Cinderella is great for board control. Another great combo with Cinderella is Seth the arbiter. Having two Cinderellas and a Seth is basically an infinite combo against aggro decks that play a lot of small creatures. Methistophiles the demon is your finisher, great all around card. Run 2 necronomicom because that card and flipped Lumia is broken. Stoning to death and dream of Juliet become recurring draw and kill spells every turn. Remember with Lumia you can cast one spell per turn, which means you can also cast on your opponents turn. Take this opportunity and leave 2 darkness will up every turn and you can kill creatures forever. One more value addition I run is alice, guardian of dimensions, because for four mana with the combo out you can remove one of their creatures from the game every turn."

FoWtcg,3cxzsp,iFIy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:14:15 2015 UTC,"The way I'd build a Lumia deck would be Blue/White/Red/Green and just have tons of low cost cards to hit off of Lumia.  Then do a win condition like Blazer.  The benefit of Lumia is the huge card advantage she gets you, and the best way to take advantage of that is to have tons of answers to your opponents plays.  I don't know if a Blue/White/Black deck would be particularly good no matter what ruler you choose."
FoWtcg,3cxzsp,AntProtein,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:57:37 2015 UTC,"Considering that Lumia isn't a top tier ruler currently, I see no reason why he has to try to make a tier 1 deck.

FoWtcg,3cxzsp,Sokios,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:41:24 2015 UTC,"I love Lumia as a Ruler and really enjoyed Dark/Light/Water for a while.  It absolutely dominates aggro because of Cinderella and early blockers, but loses extremely hard to Burn without any way to stop it.  After losing so many games to Split Heaven and Earth, I switched to Wind/Dark/Light.  Another problem I had with Dark/Light/Water is that it seemed to also lose against decks that were more control heavy like Wind/Dark/Fire Abdul or Turbo Pandora.  Having no way to back up your Necronomicon play and getting it countered feels really bad.    If you're set on using these colors to try out Lumia, I recommend the following cards:  Water: Cheshire Cat (Great blocker, helps dig for answers, great for Cinderella) Mermaid of Tragic Love (Good card draw, but doesn't draw if you have Necronomicon on board) Shooting Star (I ran a single copy to work as a pseudo-counter)  Light: The Little Prince (Decent beater, late-game life gain saved me a couple times) ""I"" the Pilot (Finds Little Prince, taps down a Resonator, decent stats) Dream of Juliet (All around excellent Instant.)  Dark: Cinderella, the Ashen Maiden (Extremely potent board clearer against aggro, can find Little Prince or ""I"" the Pilot) Stoning to Death (Your bread and butter kill spell) Mephitopheles (Really slick beater and your main way to deal with J-rulers once they hit the field.) Necronomicon (If you play Lumia, you run this card.  Being able to recast everything is too good to pass up.  Multi: Alice, Guardian of Dimensions (All around good card.  Decent protection for your field and spot removal for your enemy's field.  Returnable to the field by Lumia's ability once she has exiled herself.  Vulnerable to Flame of Outer World, though...)"

FoWtcg,3cwudd,MrGingybread,3,Sat Jul 11 13:49:36 2015 UTC,"I mean this in the nicest way, as I don't want you to not play, but you can't expect to play any deck in any CCG and win. There will always be t1. Unfortunately playing Scarecrow is not an optimal resonator, and honestly if you were playing Abdul and got four out, he maybe tried to give you a chance before he got online.  That said, anyone playing ultra t1 against fun / beginner's decks is pretty weak."
FoWtcg,3cwudd,Josuke_Higashikata,2,Sun Jul 12 03:50:51 2015 UTC,"Abdul's pretty strong, that's a given. That being said, if he dies, the deck usually falls apart. If you can put the pressure onto him early, he can't safely stabilize and flip in many cases. Your deck needs to have a way to answer him or it will never be competitive."

FoWtcg,3cwudd,TCDDv2,2,Sun Jul 12 00:30:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, Abdul is broken and can be combo-ed with Necro and Mephisto, to negate their cost at the end of the turn. But it's not the best ruler, deck or card in the game. The deck depends too much on Abdul and that's it's weakness. There's so many ways to counter Abdul and once it's gone, the deck is dead. Even if you can bring Abdul first turn, no smart player would do it. As a matter of fact Grimm is still the best deck out there due to it's flexibility and consistency, it can counter most decks. It keeps topping everywhere for a reason. So I'll say Abdul can be a winning condition early game on game 1, this format, but it can be counter easily game 2 and 3 with almost any deck. However with the new support maybe we'll not see Abdul topping anymore."

FoWtcg,3cwudd,JimWolfie,2,Sun Jul 12 07:05:18 2015 UTC,"Like the problem with looking at Bin laden like that is that the deck he slots into is just a pile of removal, a small number of ramp and some late game finishers. his removal is also fairly cheap and it lines up nicely to anything that uses achievement counters. that core also runs the greediest mana base on the planet. You know what's funny? 99% of my bin laden list is my charazard list. I just swap out the stories for necros and a some of the more off color removal spells for law of silences.   You should be asking yourself how to attack jund control, not asking us how to beat bin laden as a strategy. Decks are 66 cards. Not 40 + 10 stones + 1 ruler + 15 cards in your side board."
FoWtcg,3cwudd,jeef16,2,Sun Jul 12 05:34:29 2015 UTC,"abdul can seem daunting at first, especially if you come from a casual MTG scene or new to any TCG. I come from yugioh, so broken control decks are second nature to me. I play abdul, and the main problem with the deck is that it will lose to itself early game. Once you let them get to mid/late game, you probably lost. If the player is bad, you can just bait out his entire hand and just hope he doesnt draw necro, but you can do a lot of dmg. You either have to kill them early, bait out their hands, or kill abdul once he drops. Sure, its a good deck and is top tier, but sometimes you just gotta buckledown and learn the matchup. Believe me, having constant banlists like in yugioh sucks, especially for a game that has rotating sets. I play split in my abdul deck, so I guess that makes me extra degenerate"
FoWtcg,3cwudd,BrohannesJahms,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:28:26 2015 UTC,"There's a reason that Grimm and Abdul are the two top decks by a significant margin right now.  Abdul shuts down a huge number of strategies from Grimm and Grimm just does stronger, more proactive things than other J/rulers.  I would warn you against asking for an extensive banned list, though.  Magic has learned many lessons about excessive bans being something to avoid at all costs.  More careful design and testing is much preferred."
FoWtcg,3cwudd,CyndaneTierney,-1,Sat Jul 11 17:53:09 2015 UTC,"So, I've been watching the number of cards spoiled for the new sets.

FoWtcg,3cwudd,MagicianLord,3,Sat Jul 11 17:31:48 2015 UTC,"FoW has altered their future card designs. [Enter] will be reserved for powerful abilities that must be cast from the hand to avoid zone-changing techniques that would other abuse the ability.  New cards will come out with ""Whenever this card enters the field"" or ""Whenever this card is put on the field"" abilities.  Such cards will neuter Abdul as Abdul cannot neutralize those abilities.  This change may be a reaction to Abdul being a bit overpowered, but in Japan, many of the top decks at the championships were actually Grimm decks."

However, you only get one.  Since you'll be discarding your entire hand every turn, it becomes hard to protect Law of Silence from being countered.  Abdul can chain Law of Silence with other things, such as Cake Zone or Thunders.  While he effectively only gets one play out of his graveyard every turn, he does still get to keep his hand."

If he or she must perform any action to block, do it at this point. If he or she cannot, he or she may not do that block and rewind the game situation back to choose block or forfeit. From this point, as long as that J/resonator is in a field, it is blocking J/resonator, and the attacking J/resonator is blocked J/resonator.   The act of declaring a blocker requires resting it, so you cannot use Gardea's rest ability at the same time.

Player A takes on Player B. Player A has a Gardea on the field which was just summoned. After Player B declares his end of turn. Player A proceeds to Draw Phase and activates Gardea's ability on itself. Recovery Phase then recovers all rested resonators and Gardea has been boosted and is able to attack that turn.
FoWtcg,3ctiv2,RogoPowah,3,Fri Jul 10 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"The sentence you said used a lot of words that aren't in this game and   it mostly makes no sense so I will try to translate and then explain...  If another J-Ruler(1000/1000) attacks your recovered J-Ruler (0/3000) with target attack, do you have to tap your J-Ruler or does it just lose 1000 defense?  I think that is what your question translates to....  So starting from the top, when something with target attack attacks a recovered J/Resonator the target does not need to rest, if the attack is unblocked it would go through.  Combat doesn't make cards ""lose"" anything. They take damage. Damage lasts until end of turn when it clears and a card is destroyed if the damage is has taken is greater than or equal to it's defense. Meaning your J-Ruler would still be a 0/3000, but it would have taken 1000 damage."

Yes if its your turn and you didn't use him to activate an ability that would make him tapped or make his card sideways.   As for the the 2nd half of the question (since you are trying to ask two questions in one sentence) The j/ruler can't attack if you use an ability involving turning the card sideways or if you used him to call a magic stone.   As said, to get the best results in asking questions, keep it simple and try to use common terms that is used in the game. I going to assume English is not your first language from the way you are wording your questions.   As said, you probably should try to learn the game by playing the game."
FoWtcg,3ctiv2,Myrrodin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:05:20 2015 UTC,"I think the question is does the j-ruler flip to the ruler side. If that's the question, you only go back to ruler side by a card effect (little red wolf girl) or if you take damage at or above yoyr defense in a round (I believe you lose your ruler abilities in this case as well)"
FoWtcg,3ctiv2,darkdestiny91,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:12:47 2015 UTC,"That also could be it, but the because of the way the question was worded, it could go anywhere."

FoWtcg,3ctiv2,chaosofslayer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:44:34 2015 UTC,"Your player hp is seperate from your jruler. Your life total has nothing to do with your ruler. In valhalla if your jruler died you lost half your health, but this rule was removed with the release of grimm cluster. So to repeat, your ruler/jruler has nothing to do with your player life total anymore.  Is that what you're asking?  Rulers cannot be attacked on their ruler side as they are not a resonator. But when you j-activate it it enters the field as a j-ruler and can be targeted by your opponent if it's rested or if they have a j/resonator with target attack. If your J-ruler is destroyed, it moves to the astral ruler zone and becomes an astral ruler. (Unless it has imperishable in which case you flip it back over and it becomes a regular ruler again) If you have an astral ruler you no longer have a ruler/jruler which means synergy cards such as stories told in 1001 nights no longer use their bonus effect. All you can do with an astral ruler is call stone. It can't do anything else.  Hope that clears things up."
FoWtcg,3ctiv2,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"Another question from a new player.  If you j-activate your ruler while they're rested do they stay rested, recover, or do they become a new instance of a card which would enter the battlefield in the recovered state?  Also I'm assuming just because of how Red Riding Hood has swiftness on her J side that J-rulers have summoning sickness (not sure what the FoW term is for that) when they come into play."

FoWtcg,3crrf6,angstrom401,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:52:47 2015 UTC,"Someone at our shop has a pretty good one, but its pretty reliant on the promo card Morrigan, the Goddess of Tragic Love- which is not tournament legal.  Other than that, I can say the deck isn't in too great a spot. Gets rushed down by the Burn/aggro decks since 200 health minions do nothing and even when it stabilizes the minion flood it'll still lose to the burn spells to the face.  Then against control it doesn't do too well either as the early minions it drops aren't too threatening and as such they can just Hold Xeex/Exceed to cancel your big drops you try to incarnation down.  Although Nyarlathotep itself is pretty darn threatening, but easily dealt with by Crime and Punishment- but not every deck runs more than 1 copy and may not be consistent in its ability to search it out.  I think off the top of my head, the deck has a great Turbo Pandora matchup- but after game 1 they'll just swap their ruler (since most run alternate rulers) and will understand how to play around your deck."
FoWtcg,3crrf6,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:19:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I see. So what would you say is the meta at this point in time?"
FoWtcg,3crrf6,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:29:47 2015 UTC,"It's Aggro/Burn Grimm and Bahamut decks and Green/Black/Red Ramp/Control decks(PandoraDark/Dracula/Scheherazade/Abdul) that use Green Ramp/Counterspell cards, Red/Black removal cards, and Big Red/Black drops such as Blazer/Mephistopheles/Gilles.  Then a few Grimmia players are also around- but that's the majority of the meta."
FoWtcg,3crrf6,darkdestiny91,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:44:06 2015 UTC,"Cthulhu isn't horrible to any extent, it really boils down to how the deck is built. For Cthulhu decks, what you seek is board and hand advantage.  All your small resonators give some form of return to hand or interact with the graveyard (king in yellow, black goat, shantuk, etc) while the big ones have strong effects that bring big hitters to the field or just destroy anything in your way (Shub-niggurath, Yog-sototh, etc).  But they're pretty weak now, since they're very vulnerable to removal or cancels which is strong in the meta now. However, the upcoming set of Vingolf and MoA brings a lot of new toys like Rasputin and Nyarlothep (resonator version) so you do get some new things to play with.  Oh, I kind of feel that the current Cthulhu ruler, Nyarlothep, isn't great and building a deck around him and his j-activated ability isn't good enough. So I suggest building a deck less dependent on him so you could side in Abdul if needed against certain matchups."
FoWtcg,3crlyn,puraschiku,2,Fri Jul 10 05:25:26 2015 UTC,"Little Red is actually only used in the niche deck elves- although in the next set it might become t1 with the new Christie Resonator.  Wind is considered pretty OP, so you're not off. But not for the reasons you listed.  The meta is basically divided in two builds, the Ramp/control builds which use Elvish Priest, Gretel, and Fiethsing + 10 Counterspells and black/red control/burn/big minions. (Ramp plus counterspells in the same color is honestly the biggest mistake made in the game's design.) and then red aggro/burn decks which use Split Heaven and Earth to punish the green deck's greedy mana base (since they usually run something like 4 Stone of Dark Silence, 4 Stone of Blasting Waves, a Feethsing, and a Grubelesta)  Also, colors aren't necessarily supposed to be balanced against each other, as deck building doesn't restrict you to a single color- especially when the game has dual stones.  But if you want a color tier list, its basically Green>Red>>Black>White>>Blue  Blue is too slow in the current meta and its spells are terrible. The only meta deck that includes blue stones is Grimm Oddgro which is really just a Red Burn deck with Dreams of Wonderland for tempo. Then traditional grimm decks run Etna/Hamelinn and tech in Kai for  Abdul, but they don't run blue stones since Grimm lets them cheat the color cost anyway.  Although let me say this, in the upcoming releases White seems to be getting quite a nice boost, so its entirely possible that Mono-white decks will become viable in the next set- especially since they have arguably the best True Stone in Almerius (atleast if your using a deck that doesn't have fly on its finishers)  My hope is in the Alice cluster they move counterspells back to blue- this is basically the only real change of color attributes between this game and magic, and it's definitely made a noticeable impact on color balance. And its also kind of lame that Green is forced to either run multiple colors or mass counterspells since even though they have ramp, they don't have any especially nice creatures to play with that ramp."
FoWtcg,3crlyn,g_Xanac,2,Fri Jul 10 06:27:56 2015 UTC,"/u/g_Xanac covered most of what I was going to say, but one thing to point out is that both Morgiana and Sinbad have REPLACEMENT effects. Their effects say the word ""instead"" that means that if you have multiples you have to decide which one to do. For example if you had 2 of each in play you could activate all 4 replacing your draw, however, the first effect to resolve will replace the draw and then the others would look for a draw to replace and there wouldn't be one! You can read more about replacement effects in the CR in the sidebar."

I am currently thinking Abdul erases all abilities.  It makes the card a ""vanilla"" card.  1b) Yes, the player with priority can respond to Abdul's ""ability erasure"" ability.   2) Yes, you can play Law of Silence after your opponent gives up priority but before he/she draws.  3) Yes.  4)    [Enter] abilities are triggered when the card with it is played from a player's hand and put from chase area, or when judgment resolved and J-ruler is put into a field. If the card is put into chase area from zones without playing it from hand, or the card comes into a field from zones other than chase area, [Enter] doesn't trigger.   Yes, Abdul and cancel spell prevent [Enter] effects from happening.  Abdul's ability is a replacement effect.  Cancel spells negate the spell in the Chase Area entirely.  Although the wording is awkward, [Enter] abilities are meant to trigger when the card is played from your hand and resolves from the Chase area onto the field.  Your opponent casting Thunder on Gretel will not stop her [Enter] ability, as the [Enter] ability has already triggered."

Being all humans my deck has issues against Carmilla when I'm up against the vampires, but Light has so much hate against Darkness it normally manages, especially after sideboard. Biggest issue I seem to be having is against Grim control, when they get out a turn 2-3 Piper. I really have a hard time against that, even with sideboards, I just have to pray I see a Return to Stories in the first couple of turns.    Very keen to see what other cards I get to mess around with from this new set, these previews have gotten me very excited! :D"

Also, we get Jeanne D'Arc in the Vingolf set that can self-boost when 4 other light resonators are on the field as well as the Grimm resonator that buffs light resonators.

Automatic abilities are abilities with text ""[Continuous] <effect>"" or ""<effect>"", or [Spell: Chant-standby] cards in hand or chant-standby area, and need to meet any condition or [Trigger] to play, or [Enter] abilities. Automatic abilities watch game situation and if its trigger condition is met, it's automatically played in priority sequence.  Each of automatic abilities has it's condition to play it. It's called triggering condition. If the condition is met, number of triggered times of the ability is increase one. If the number of triggered times of an ability is one or more, the ability is considered ""triggered""   Heartless Tin Man's first ability:   [Continuous] When an addition is added to a resonator you control or an [Addition:Field] is put into your field, put an achievement counter on this card.    The bolded part is a trigger condition that must occur.  In that scenario, Slipper of Cinderella has already modified the stats of Heartless Tin Man.  Per Rule 6 - Priority Sequence and Rule 13.2 - Destroying, Heartless Tin Man is destroyed by the Addition, before Heartless Tin Man's ability can trigger to put the achievement counter into the Chase Area to buff itself.   So, Heartless Tin Man is destroyed before getting the achievement counter."
FoWtcg,3cpbg6,MagicianLord,2,Thu Jul 9 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"Based off of how 8.3 Declare Block Step in the CR reads, if the resonator is blocked, unless they are removed from the combat then the blocked has happened. So Giving it flying after the block was declared does nothing. You would want to give it flying before blockers are declared that way it cannot be blocked except by flyers.   2. Let's see: >[Continuous] When an addition is added to a resonator you control or an [Addition:Field] is put into your field, put an achievement counter on this card.   So as long as nothing else happens, the Tin Man will get the achievement counter for having the addition added to a resonator, making him a 500/500 and then down to a 100/100 due to the -400/-400."

They play the complete ramp package of Elvish Priest on 1, Gretel on 2, and Fiethsing on 3, as well as backing it up with 8-10 counter-spells.

Not sure on a lot of things about it though as I've seen it said both that it comes with 2 of each dual stone and alternately that it comes with 2 random stones. Also, some places said it releases later this month while the amazon seller I ordered from said they were in stock, and indeed already shipped. No tracking though so we'll see if something shows up in a few days.   (Newsman voice) More on this story as it develops!"

The cool thing about it is that one of the owners, all the employees, and people like me all play FOW and we all play either MTG or YUGIOH as well so people are always there with decks.  So I know it's hard finding people to play with sometimes so we would love to have you come in, hang with us, and we can help you find the cards you need and any deck building or game questions you may have!"

So Aramis would create 1 will for itself as well.  9.6  [Enter]  abilities  are  triggered  when  the  card  with  it  is  played  from  a  player's hand  and  put  from  chase  area,  or  when  judgment  resolved  and  J-ruler  is  put into  a  field.  If  the  card  is  put  into  chase  area  from  zones  without  playing  it from  hand,  or  the  card  comes  into  a  field  from  zones  other  than  chase  area, [Enter]  doesn't  trigger.   So it's on the board and counts itself.  When an ability is put onto the chase it resolves unless countered.   Section 9 goes over abilities in pretty good detail."

People just claimed that Abdul and Charizard were different decks, but they had almost the same control shell.   Right now, most decks just need to learn to work around Split Heaven and Earth. It is single handedly changing the game, and I think it's a good thing. Before it, every deck was a four or five color good stuff, with almost the same cards. Now, people have to think at least a little bit."

I played something close to this in my first tournament and got destroyed in every game, it was little red wolf girl and other werewolves. I've changed the ruler to a more consistent thing and swapped out the creatures."
FoWtcg,3chqi2,darkdestiny91,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"This deck is pretty much the mono-red aggro deck. It's a great build but I'll recommend adding 3 copies of Split Heaven and Earth into the build.  It helps deal with the control matchups since they will use quite a good amount of special stones and can serve as a interrupt bait if needed or as a way to finish the opponent off.  Also, look into getting Gilles De Rais, the Golden Dragon (not sure if the name is right) from TAT to add into the deck. It's a great card for an aggressive deck just because of its self boost and swiftness."
FoWtcg,3chl2y,Kylvam,2,Tue Jul 7 23:37:00 2015 UTC,Interesting that he thinks the die roll helps you that much.  I definitely see how it helps you a lot.  Anyone else want to chime in?
FoWtcg,3chl2y,GlisteningDragon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:35:46 2015 UTC,I personally play Bahamut and going first is honestly the only time I consistently beat three color decks. Getting the first attack or an early bahamut sac for 1-3k damage is so much easier on the play.
FoWtcg,3chl2y,domBOT,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:21:18 2015 UTC,"The die roll is super important in this game, which is actually my only complaint about the game in general. Even in non-aggressive decks being able to answer your opponent's ramp and then ramp ahead of them is amazing. I hope we eventually get reasons to play second so it would balance things out a bit, but when average games against aggro decks last 4-7 turns going first is very relevant."
FoWtcg,3cj1aq,GReaper5,2,Wed Jul 8 08:06:24 2015 UTC,"The two I recommend for Wererabbits are Joan of arc (nameless girl) and Little Red Wolf Girl(Little Red Riding hood).  Joan is basically a board wipe that doesn't affect any of your dudes and let's you run red for removal and big dragon finishers. So you have the tempo of wererabbits and the burn of red. It's how I would build them.  Riding hood gives you access to werewolves and rabbits. Still have the burn of red, you can play a ton of moons to make sure she flips. (Campenella is great in here) it's much more aggressive than the Joan but has less control."
FoWtcg,3cj1aq,GrieVelorn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:26:30 2015 UTC,"I think Kaguya, Princess of the Moon could be good. I really like using her to alter Jeweled Branch of Horai to rest any of my opponents resonators. But this might be what you're already doing, I'm not sure which Kaguya you're using.   People have also had success playing a little more aggressively. Running Little Red as the Ruler and playing more of the moon cards. If you want to focus on Resting and locking your opponent down, look into Etna and Pied Piper. They are awesome at that."
FoWtcg,3cj1aq,chansterling,2,Wed Jul 8 08:29:04 2015 UTC,I use Princess of the moon. I run 2 pied pipers and 2 rat catcher pipes. If I use jeweled branch then I feel the Light/Water Alice will help protect my resonators. Thank you. Now I need Etna in my life.

So silver bullet wouldn't get it's cost reduction since it's no longer your ""ruler"" or ""j-ruler"", it's an astral ruler.

FoWtcg,3cbmlk,SailorPalaven,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:53:06 2015 UTC,"That was pretty interesting, and since you came into this from MtG, maybe you can give me some perspective. I got my partner into FoW from Magic so we'd both have a game to play together and he's honestly already fairly fed up with it. It's actually somehow gotten him back into MtG even more! =P   He's playing FNM now, and if he has a uniform 'Playstyle' it's that he doesn't care about 'competitive' play. He just wants to play, and have a good time. Apparently at last week's FNM, the judge was excited to see him show up and kept hovering around his matches because he the only one having interesting matches.   I came into FoW from dabbling in Pokemon, and basically got all of our friends into it. Our LGS got a box in, I bought a pack because I worked there and no one knew what we'd gotten. I ripped Jean d'Arc in my first pack and said ""this is the most &%$ gorgeous card game I've ever seen, I need to know more!""  I just love building decks, especially themed ones. I'm buying cards at this point to give us more deck fodder, since we'll both have several decks going at the same time and I don't want to bust them down 24/7.   We did our first tournament (draft) at a nearby GS and I think that was the final straw. One guy aggressively tried to convince me to make my decks in line with the ""meta"", and they're all obsessed with Abdul/Cheshire/Gretel and all running decklists that're 80-90% identical, down to the stones. We're fairly certain some of them cheat, too.  It's just disappointing to see him so..burnt out? I'm looking at making a FoW Cube, but I'm not sure there's much else I can do to get him interested again, even just in basic ""kitchen table"" FoW.    Ideas?"

That's the quickest way to 1. Identify any problems in your deck and 2. decide if you actually enjoy the game enough to invest more in it!"

FoWtcg,3cdvo7,twinrhapsody,2,Tue Jul 7 16:23:17 2015 UTC,"1. Hastur is necessary for any Cthulhu-based deck, as he is on theme, a removal spell, and easy to Incarnate.  2. Hound of Tindalos is surprisingly weak a majority of the time. IMO it is strictly worse than King in Yellow, which you are running already. I would actually cut Hounds and add Lora, the Blood Speaker. Simply treat her as a weaker King, just Incarnate fodder, as she replaces herself upon entry. 3. Add more removal spells. MPR has Bind of Gravity which is great for any deck that wants to either get through, or attack multiple times with a Yog. I don't think Zero is worth it if you are only playing 2 with 1 Void Blast. Consider dropping her for more Trapezohedrons. 4. Add a 4th Shantak and Forty Thieves. These both allow you to put what you want into your Graveyard, and should be ran with maximum consistency. Don't be afraid to block every attack with a Shantak just to get a fatty in your bin. 5. Last suggestion is Black Moon. It is a very good late game way to get around counterspells and just punch through high amounts of damage. Keep in mind you will NOT get any Enter effects from the things you resurrect. I would cut Akashic Records for 2 Moons, as Akashic doesn't have the best line-up to work with in your list."
FoWtcg,3cdvo7,twinrhapsody,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:23:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, Hastur is a card I was looking at.  I had wondered if using Hounds and Kings was a little overkill and unnecessarily redundant."
FoWtcg,3cdvo7,darkdestiny91,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"Kings are good because they replace themselves, and they work well with Slipper of Cinderella if you choose to play those."
FoWtcg,3cdvo7,darkdestiny91,2,Wed Jul 8 07:12:00 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend playing a few more games to let you have a feel of what's wrong with the deck and what you will need. I feel like you have too many bombs (aka big finishers) in the deck so cutting them down for more smaller creatures you'll use to incarnate/early board presence will be useful.  Also, look into spells for removal, playing black gives you great options in Void Blast (you may also want to look into Zero, Magus of Null to lower its cost), Flames of the Outer World (will require a red base too but this is one of the best removals in the game now), and Stoning to Deaths from the TAT set. Other spells you might want may include Bind of Gravity to lock down big hitters that you don't have removal for or resonators that do more upon dying like Blazer and Gilles De Rais.  Lastly, do a bit of research and pay attention to how other decks work so you can learn to deal with them when you play against them in the future."

For example tell a fairy tail states that enter keyword ability triggers. So even if the awakening ability stayed, blinking it with romeo and juliet will not trigger enter keyword abilities."
FoWtcg,3ccyv7,Zyglrox_Ex,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:15:23 2015 UTC,After reading the wording on how awakening works again i will make a correction. So when you remove the card from play it reverts to its base state. Awakening is essentially part of the casting cost and cannot be paid for unless casted from the players hand. So my previous statemt still holds true about enter keyword triggers. But also awakening will only trigger when played from your hand and paid for accordingly unless another card superceeds it.
FoWtcg,3ccyv7,Zyglrox_Ex,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:30:50 2015 UTC,"Enter effects only trigger when played from hand unless otherwise stated (See: I the Pilot). Likewise, Awakening is only when the card is being cast from hand. You can't trigger awakening from ""put into play."""

FoWtcg,3cbakj,PupperoniPeete,2,Mon Jul 6 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"After a player's turn starts, before they draw, that player begins a priority sequence, creating an opportunity for either player to cast a Chant-Instant or Quickcast Resonator. This is the opportune time to use Law of Silence (before your opponent has a chance to draw Exceed or Cake Zone).   Until Law of Silence resolves, any player can put anything on the chase that they normally can. You can Cake Zone Law of Silence or anything on that chase. But once Law resolves and goes to the graveyard, no more spells can be activated by the opponent.   Things to pay attention to: If playing against green, make sure to have at least 4 green Will available so you can Cake Zone their negate if you cast Law. You can also use it offensively during your turn to prevent your opponent from using Xeex or Cake Zones to stop your plays."

FoWtcg,3c8o7p,fr49200,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"There were over 250 players at the california regional yesterday if you're wondering about game health- (this is first year for fow in US)  As far as budget lists, good dracula decks are Green/Red/Black which run up a ton of money- on the flip side you build one its cheap to switch to another Green/Red/Black deck. But you could try building a just Green/Black Dracula- but your going to need some carmillas for dracula regardless- which is an $8 card(per copy)  Cthulhu decks will want Flame of Outerworld and Thunder which are both ~$12-16 cards(per copy) although everything else in the deck would be pretty cheap.  Just letting you know, pretty much everything in modern meta runs 4 copies of thunder in it, so you get a set of them for ~$40-50 they can fit into pretty much any deck. Although later this month there's a deck building kit(vingolf) coming out that will include 2 copies of Thunder, Law of Silence, and Stoning to Death (Some ""staple"" rare spells) as well as 2 copies of each dual stone. You can buy a copy of this starter set for ~$40- which if you look at the value of just those cards is currently worth ~$140 although obviously the values of these cards will drop with the release of Vingolf. Still a really good place to start with.  Now I'll dig up some lists for you."
FoWtcg,3c8o7p,Nyte_Crawler,2,Sun Jul 5 23:08:22 2015 UTC,"""Budget"" Black Dracula /w white splash  Ruler: Dracula  4 Lora the Bloodspeaker  3 Carmilla the vampire mistress (here's the bulk of the cost of the deck- ~$25 for 3 copies)  3 Servant of Vampire  4 Spiral of Despair  3 Bind of Gravity  2 Whisper from the Abyss  3 Bloodsucking Impulse  1 Pumpkin Witch  1 Necronomicon  3 Laplacia, the Demon of Fate (or swap this with Vampire's Staff, I think the 3 drop is better though)  3 Alvarez, the Demon Castle  2 Vampire's Coffin  3 Seth the Arbiter  3 Dream of Juliet  2 The Little Prince  Mana Deck:  1 Light Stone  7 Dark Stone  2 Stone of Heaven's Rift (Change these to two light stones if you don't want to pay for dual stones)  This deck should cost somewhere around ~$50 without the dual stones, $60 with (and ~$35 of this is just Dracula and Carmillas). This list is nice for punishing removal heavy decks because with Seth you can recycle carmillas by using them to grab each other as long as seth is in play. In addition, Alvarez can actually get some insane value because a lot of people have been ignoring addition removal. The low special stone count, bloodsucking impulse, and the Little Prince are fit in there to play against burn- although against burn you might run still get run down as this is a deck that is a very slow deck that just hopes to exhaust your opponent through an excessive amount of Carmilla drops and using Spiral to Shrink their hand.  Not sure if this will win you any tournaments (as this thing will auto fold to Abdul- but if your not willing to spend money to invest in red(thunders) then you're not going to be able to remove him anyway), but for a $50 deck (compared to the $120-200 meta ones) this one should be able to hold its ground."

FoWtcg,3c7ubp,Jason9376595,4,Sun Jul 5 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"So while playing my friends and I came across a few situations where we were lost for answers  1) The mulligan draw in the beginning, can this happen only once?   Yes. It only happens once.   2) Are Incarnation costs from the hand, field, or grave?   Incarnation is sacrificing resonators in play in order to cast a resonator from your hand with the ability.   3) Is Banishing and Removing From Game the same mechanic?   No. Banishing is like sacrificing in magic. They die, nothing can stop it. Removing from the Game is a different mechanic, and even has its own dedicated pile. Your discard pile is public information, RFG zone is not.   4) Stories Told in 1001 Nights says to search your opponents deck for other copies, do you do this or your opponent?   The player casting stories does the searching.   5) The J/Ruler Grimmia has an Activate ability to give it Swiftness and Target Attack.  Can this be activated the turn it is J/activated or do you wait a turn before using its Active Effects.  And if this is the case, why does it even say Swiftness   You can activate her swiftness ability the turn she is J-activated. The only times you can't is if it's an ability that requires them to rest (tap). Likewise, you can shoot things with Cain the turn he J-Activates. Same principle."

There is an appointed U.S. Head Judge named Matt Kozmor who administers an on-site test to those interested in becoming a judge (rules advisor).  Matt will be at all the FoW regional tournaments in July, except Hawaii.  There is no online version of the test.  Note: It has been said that the test is harder than Magic's L1 tests, because while FoW is similar to Magic, it's not an exact copy.  3)  Some LGSes have two ""demo decks"" that can be used to try out the game.  They are made of different card stock, so they are not tournament legal.  I don't know the decks' contents, but that might be your best bet.  The Valhalla starter decks definitely are not fairy tale decks, and are not tournament legal in most stores, since those stores don't run Origin formats (Eternal)   4) You have two ways of playing Chant - Standby cards.  a) During your main phase, you can pay {2} Will of any kind to set a card into the Chant - Standby Area.  You can set any card in the Chant - Standby Area, even cards that are not Chant -  Standby cards (for bluffing).  Cards that are not Chant - Standby cards cannot currently be played from the Chant - Standby Area as there is no existing card or ability that allows this.  Chant - Standby cards set in the Chant - Standby Area have trigger conditions on them.  When the trigger condition is fulfilled on a Chant - Standby card, you may play that card for free.  b) If you have a Chant - Standby card in your hand and when the trigger condition on that card is fulfilled, you may pay the attribute cost (casting cost) of the card to play it."

Otherwise, what you should know is later this month there's a bunch of stuff coming out.  A) Millenia of Ages, the last set of the first cluster/block Grimm  B) Vingolf: Engage Knights- a deckbuilding kit for new players- if you can find it discounted somewhere for 40 or less I would go for it, from what we can tell the resonators/creatures in the set suck ass- but it will come with 2 copies of rare staple spells (Thunder/Stoning to Death/Law of Silence) and 2 copies of each dual stone (which every deck usually runs dual stones, even in the mono-red burn its not uncommon to fit in 2-3)  C) New starter decks- from what has been spoiled, the cards in these aren't complete garbage, but the cards will show up later in the first set of the next block, which doesn't have a release date yet.  but DO NOT BUY CURRENT STARTER DECKS. as I just said, there's new ones coming out very soon, and the old ones were made for the valhalla cluster, which had an extremely limited release in the west, so the cards are not tournament legal, and on top of that the rules that valhalla plays with are extremely outdated and include mechanics that they decided to drop from the game."
FoWtcg,3c69ke,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:13:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I checked their official site, and there is actually an official store very close by, that i was ironically already going to check out soon for their yugioh tourneys. I went ahead and pre-ordered the Vingolf box on ebay for about 40, I figure it'll help me jump into deck building asap.   Is there anything else I need to know? Also, one dumb little question, what are the exact requirements/guidelines for a deck? I know you have your magic stone deck of 10-20 (Is there any profit in running very few? Higher color consistency?) and your main deck of minimum 40, but whats the deck maximum, and do they have to be mono colored or can I fit any number of colors into a deck?"
FoWtcg,3c69ke,kinkofthen00s,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:56:00 2015 UTC,"Most decks usually run 10 for as you said, color consistency. But if your running a true mono (as in no special stones and just 1 color) then there's no reason not to run 20 basic red stones for example.  Deck doesn't have a maximum, but once again, consistency means you want to have fewer cards in your deck so your more likely to draw what you do want. And you can fit any number of colors into a deck.  Its also worth mentioning that games are played as best two out of three, and as such you do build a 15 card sideboard to swap in cards between matches. Your sideboard can contain up to 15 cards and includes Magic Stones/Rulers/Main Deck cards, whichever 15 you wish. But when you start a game you still have to follow standard deck rules (1 ruler, 40 card main deck, 10-20 card stone deck)  Other than that, I'll just say that the metagame is a bit pricey to get into atm. There's basically two deck engines atm, Grimm and Green/Black/Red ramp/control. But since theres a new set coming out later this month I'd hold off on buying up cards to build one of these decks- except I think that regardless of what shows up in the new set, I think grimm aggro/burn is still going to stick around.  Here's the top 8 lists from the Indonesian nationals last week. The first two lists are prime examples of what deck I'm talking about."
FoWtcg,3c69ke,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:05:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for all the info! It seems like the deck building is fairly similar to yugioh in that less equals consistency. For now I'll stick to the box I pre-ordered, and build what I can from that, and go from there, which basically means deciding whether or not I like the game enough to invest more in it. Also I most certainly won't be buying singles until the new set comes, as I'd like to as much starting-from-scratch as possible, and a new set the month I discover the game? Must be fate!

FoWtcg,3c06w9,DarkMandis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"Yep. This is one major difference from MTG; if a blocker is destroyed or otherwise removed BEFORE damage is dealt, all of the damage goes to the ORIGINAL object, be it player or Resonator. A little more complex to explain but I will try. Essentially the ""priority sequence"" is 2 things. A: it is what you do whenever something happens to check for triggers and alterations to your cards, and B: it is when players may respond to one another. I'll try to give an example.   You cast ""Stoning to Death"" targeting your opponent's Resonator. At this point you perform the priority sequence. If the Resonator you chose to target has anything that ""goes off"" from being targeted, such as Mephistopholes does, you then add that ON TOP of your Thunder, and another priority sequence will start. At this point, you and your opponent must pass priority in order to start resolving your effects. Going top-to-bottom, Meph's damage trigger will resolve, making you lose 500, then your Stoning to Death will be resolving. IF at this final part of the ""Chase"" your opponent passes his portion of the priority sequence, Stoning to Death will finally resolve, Meph will be destroyed, and you will continue with whoever's turn it is or Phase you are in."
FoWtcg,3c06w9,twinrhapsody,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:26:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, unlike MTG if a blocker is removed the block was not successful and the damage goes through. It means that turn player has priority to do something. So the turn player can play a card before the non turn player can play one."
FoWtcg,3c06w9,GrieVelorn,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"1) If the blocking resonator is removed from play, destroyed, or changes zones before the battle damage resolution step, the attacking resonator will deal damage to the original intended recipient.  2) See ""Rule 6 Priority Sequence"" in the Comprehensive Rules. Basically, after most actions, the turn player receives priority.  The turn player can decide to cast spells, activate abilities, or put triggered abilities into the Chase Area.  If turn player passes priority, then the non-turn player gets the opportunity to take the same actions.  If both players pass, if there is anything in the Chase Area, you resolve one of them.  After resolving something from the Chase Area, turn player gains priority and the whole table in Rule 6 starts again from the beginning."
FoWtcg,3c06w9,MagicianLord,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:37:40 2015 UTC,"1) If the blocking resonator is destroyed before the normal battle step, the attack will proceed towards whoever the turn player chose to attack (another J/resonator or the opposing player)  2) Performing a priority sequence means that turn player has a chance to do something that is appropriate for the current gamestate before the opponent. This could be summoning a resonator, activating an ability, casting a spell, or other things as long as it is an appropriate time to perform the action. Once you have done what you wanna do, priority is passed to your opponent to respond. This continues until everything has resolved and both players pass priority, and then the game continues until a different point in time when a priority sequence can happen again."

FoWtcg,3byhsu,Lifeknife2,4,Fri Jul 3 05:01:16 2015 UTC,"Since #2 has caused some confusion, here's the play by play.  You control 2 Mephisto's (for sake of argument, nothing else) and we move to end of turn. Mephisto A's sacrifice trigger goes on the chase. Then, before any other things occur, Mephisto B's sacrifice trigger goes on the chase. Mephisto B tells you to kill someone that's not him, so Mephisto A bites the dust. Then, Mephisto A's sacrifice trigger resolves and forces you to sacrifice someone that's not Mephisto A. Because of this, Mephisto B gets killed as well.  TL;DR: double assisted suicide. Once the trigger is on the chase, the status of that Mephisto being in play is irrelevant."
FoWtcg,3byhsu,CardboardJesusWoW,2,Fri Jul 3 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"For #2 I believe you have to banish both Mephistopheles as both will trigger at the end of turn phase, and both triggers must resolve."

FoWtcg,3byhsu,ftkaleh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:49:23 2015 UTC,"How does it not have a legal target? They both have to banish another resonator so the first has to banish the second, and the second has to banish the first."
FoWtcg,3byhsu,Xaxzas,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:54:20 2015 UTC,"If you control only two Mephistopheles, the Abyssal Tyrant at the end of your turn, both of them will trigger and go onto chase. Both Mephistopheles are forced to target eachother and both will be removed once the triggers are resolved."
FoWtcg,3byhsu,Siphir,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:55:48 2015 UTC,"Both abilities are triggered since their only requirement is met. ""At the end of turn"" being that requirement. You choose how each trigger goes onto to chase and resolve them one at a time. One Mephistopheles will resolve and banish the other, then the 2nd trigger from the other resolves and banishes the remaining Mephistopheles. You don't just ignore it, it doesn't fizzle because there is a legal target."
FoWtcg,3byhsu,Siphir,2,Fri Jul 3 07:21:58 2015 UTC,"That's not how an triggered ability would fizzle. Regardless of the other Mephistopheles being there or not after the first trigger resolves. It's trigger goes on chase along with the other Mephistopheles and resolves just the same.  Edit: If there's one Mephistopheles on the field, along with another resonator. If you let it's continuous ability to trigger and respond by destroying Mephistopheles, its ability is still triggered and has to resolve, banishing the other resonator. If you kill Mephistopheles before its ability triggers then the other resonator lives."
FoWtcg,3byhsu,Siphir,-1,Fri Jul 3 07:29:02 2015 UTC,"Force of Will plays differently from other games. When multiple things would happen at once the player with priority chooses which effect will happen first, and then that effect can be given chase to and then it resolves- then it moves on to the next one.  So if you have two Mephistopheles you only banish one because as Lohrumes has said, you start one's effect and by the time its continuous resolves there is no longer a second Mephistopheles who needs a continuous resolved."
FoWtcg,3byhsu,Nyte_Crawler,0,Fri Jul 3 07:49:51 2015 UTC,"Both abilities enter the chase at a time, but they won't be resolved until both are on the chase already."

FoWtcg,3byhsu,CardboardJesusWoW,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:02:28 2015 UTC,"1) Yes  2) I'm not sure, but I assume you'll have to banish one  3) No battle phase, attacking/blocking are in the main phase; Yes, Yes(Attacking and blocking are the same phase), and No, there is no battle phase, your opponent will play be able to activate an instant spell/ability before attacking, during the damage step, your main phase again. This only works if this spell is an instant.  4) End Phase and Untap Phase(Right after draw phase)  5) Situation 1: Stoning goes to the remove from game as Blazer is still in play before the CL resolves. Situation 2: Cast 2 stonings at the same time, both will be removed from game as the chain resolves like this 1st stoning target Blazer, 2nd stoning targets another resonator, BOTH resolve at the same time while Blazer is still there, so both leave the field before Blazer does. This is apparently YOU have priority when you cast a spell right after instead of your opponent and you pass priority after. However if you let the stonings resolve one at a time, letting the first one target blazer, after it has resolved, blazer is now gone. Thus the second stoning used on the second resonator will go to grave.    6) Yes, I will assume you are talking about priority? If you untap and then pass priority to your opponent and they decide to do nothing, its on to the main phase. If you've passed priority, then it's your opponents call to play an instant/react. If you play a spell/summon, you then pass priority to your opponent to see if they react and then after it resolves or a chain is started. This works vice versa, if your opponent plays a card/s, they then pass priority to you to see if you can react to it or not.  I'm a little iffy on 2 and 5. If I'm wrong please correct me as this is what I seem to be true.  Thanks for reading!"
FoWtcg,3byhsu,CireT,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:18:12 2015 UTC,5. it depends on which you target first. If you stoning the blazer first then gretel both stoning would be removed. If you target gretel first only the stoning targeting blazer would be removed.

FoWtcg,3byhsu,ftkaleh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:07:34 2015 UTC,"2.) Actually, both Meph's will die as their sacrifice clauses hit the chase at the same time. Killing one won't remove it from the stack. They'll both end up dead.  5.b) It depends on the order played. If the stoning on Blazer is the last to resolve, everything will hit RFG zone. If it's the first, just its stoning and Blazer."

The blue one is probably the best but right now you probably don't even need dedicated draw spells.   Green is a busted color in this game, not only is it the color of ramp but it's also the color of counter magic which rewards you if you manage to land one of the ramp cards that are on the table. How does it reward you? You get to draw a card. Yeah. It's that good.   Combine that with super effecient removal from red and black, and the fact that yawgmoth's will is legal in this game as an enchantment and you have a very scary color combonation."

FoWtcg,3bwwpm,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:06:40 2015 UTC,"The meta at the moment is Ramp/Control with some burn thrown in.  There's basically two core engines being ran, which is the Green/Black/Red Control- usually with 30 of the same cards and the last 10 being a big different depending on the ruler.  Then there's Grimm. Grimm gets to cheat paying mana on fairy tales and as such the mana base in the deck is purely reflective of the spells being ran, and not of the creatures. As such it usually fits in Hamelin, Cheshire Cat, and Etna- probably the best 3 blue creatures in game- and not have to run blue mana since blue mana spells are lackluster atm. So Grimm ramps because it has a 1 light+2 any mana spell that lets you get a fairy tale out of your deck and play it- so you grab Hamelin a 5 mana resonator and play it on turn 3. Some Grimm decks kinda mix the green ramp in and get Hamelin out on turn 2.  Other than that, some mono-red cain burn decks have begun popping up, although Grimm burn is also gaining some steam.  So basically, in terms of what colors are good?  Green>Red>>Black=>White>>Blue  That's basically what the meta has told us."
FoWtcg,3bwgoc,Xeipher2,2,Thu Jul 2 18:43:02 2015 UTC,"If you're starting out, CMF might be good to get some of the rulers to start playing (more Gretels and Elvish Priests help too!). If you're looking for value, TAT probably has a lot more valuable cards in terms of dual stones, while MPR has some great cards for some decks like Feethsing or Blazer. It's really up to you but I feel that TAT is probably the best to invest in."
FoWtcg,3bwgoc,darkdestiny91,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:31:22 2015 UTC,"Currently most sets have fairly equal value. But I could see arguments for TaT being the best set for value currently. Just due to dual stones, cheshire, and potential full art stones. Honestly if you want to build a collection and can afford it, just getting 2-3 of each box gets you almost a full collection minus 1-4 cards.   But if you want to try and get value TaT is the best box. With CMF and MPR pretty even tied behind it. (MPR has gotten more value recently.)"

FoWtcg,3bvdef,KogasaGaSagasa,3,Thu Jul 2 13:35:15 2015 UTC,Correct Correct Correct Correct   Abdul can't stop anything that is already on the chase. Just like if you activated Guide of Heaven and in response your opponent cast Thunder on it. The ability would still go off.
FoWtcg,3bvdef,Some1Random,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:57:04 2015 UTC,An easy way to answer this is just one sentence.  Abdul does not negate.   So even if he is chasing an ability he doesn't negate it. All he does is 'blank' the card. So if that ability is already on the chase then it's going to resolve. And it does waste one of it's activates when chasing it.   Also you cannot chase to Elvish Priest's ability. It is a will producing ability and does not use the chase.(This is the same for all will producing abilities.) So you still have full priority before you cast something with that will or use a non-will producing ability.

FoWtcg,3bw2j9,TheOnlyNahlej,2,Thu Jul 2 16:57:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah none of the current starter decks are legal for Tournament play. The reason being that it's from a Cluster(Block) that we never got in the US. So while it's a good place to get a very basic starting point. Your best bet is a couple options:   Boxes. If you can or want to really get into the game boxes are actually the best way. 2-3 boxes of each set almost guarantees you a playset of everything from the set. Boxes have actual value in this game when compared to basically any other card game, they made the boxes have set ratios of cards so you always break even at the least. While not the cheapest option if you want to just have a complete collection this is what I would do.  Engage Knights. This is going to be a very very good place to start a collection. It's a starter set but also includes some reprints. Those reprints include 2 Thunder(it's basically this games Bolt), 2 Stone to Death(A staple black removal), and 2 of every Dual Stone(This is the biggest factor to get it, they are basically just like magics original duals). And it also has a bunch of descent beginner cards to have a solid starting place. If you want to get into the game with a little value/dollar ratio, this is going to be your option. Just buy 2 and have playsets of everything that is in the set.  There is also another starter deck coming out, it is a two player deck and it looks pretty solid so far. Not much is known about it, but the cards we have seen are solid. So while not the best for value/dollar it's a perfect beginner point.   Here are two good youtubers that are pretty active:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLwVjrvSJWz58ASKd3WjAag  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZM7H0-grf_0ggnVpp-tQqg  Here is an awesome tutorial series I would recommend:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-cF_wvuoh_TyePpFCl2FYIrCOIVXN2V5  There are also links in the sidebar of this subreddit for the Facebook and their official website.

If you REALLY want to build this game, look into jund with some ruler that supports a control strategy. Or if you like being aggressive go for grimm. Or burn. Burn works too. I'm not as a big fan of grimm because he probably wont scale into an eternal format very well, while cards like abdul and sharazade will.   2 of the box sets gets you started i guess, but get singles as well.

Also, you announce your target for Inquisition the moment it hits the Chase, so you CAN Shooting Star your opponent's copy to one of their own creatures. If they have 2 Recovered Resonators, they will both be forced to Rest via Inquisition's effect, and the one you Shooting Starred to will be destroyed. As for another piece of info that people overlook when using Inquisition is the simple fact that the ""Rest Recovered Resonators"" is a part of its resolution, not its cost. You don't Rest anything until Inquisition resolves."

FoWtcg,3bpjg5,LolitsaDaniel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:42:31 2015 UTC,Only if Law of Silence was played before Carmilla was played. So if you respond to the summon with Law then it will still go through because it has already been played and Law prevents spells from being played after it resolves.

Each player chooses, not just the own who cast it.  It doesn't really mean much for advantage, you just have to pick first.  (Also this is Valhalla card so it's not legal for tournament play.)"
FoWtcg,3bo77g,GrieVelorn,2,Tue Jun 30 20:32:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry to just repeat the wording... but EACH player destroys target resonator in his or her field. You choose the target first. Meaning each player has to do it, but the caster of the card does it first.  Sometimes it will be relevant and sometimes it won't, but perhaps if you destroy something with flying your opponent will destroy something without etc. There are plenty of strategic differences in who chooses first."
FoWtcg,3bo77g,Some1Random,2,Tue Jun 30 20:29:58 2015 UTC,"[Break] You may destroy a resonator in your field, if you do, you may destroy a resonator in your opponent's field.   Each player destroys target resonator in his or her field. You choose the target first.    [Break] is only applicable if you are playing with the Lifebreak mechanic.  When you use Lifebreak, only the [Break] part of the card text applies.  When you are casting the spell normally, only the non-break part applies.  So, if you cast this spell normally, you choose a target resonator in your field (i.e. under your control) to destroy first.  Then, your opponent does the same for his/her field.  For gameplay reasons, you might choose to destroy a resonator of yours that might trigger an ability upon being destroyed or a resonator that you can resurrect later (i.e. Blazer, Eater of Dimensions)."

If you call a magic stone, you can't use any other rest abilities on your ruler or J-Ruler, since the Chase Area has to be empty.  After you call your magic stone, ruler/J-Ruler abilities that don't require resting it are still allowed.  See Rule 7.11 - Call magic stone   Turn player rest his or her ruler, J-ruler or astral ruler if he or she has priority, it is his or her main phase, chase area is empty, he or she hasn't call magic stone and he or she hasn't done judgment this turn.

FoWtcg,3bn64i,grategy,2,Tue Jun 30 15:49:57 2015 UTC,No it doesn't count as him being blocked. The only time it counts is if another resonator blocks what he is attacking or if he blocks for something. You only get the one trigger for morgainna.  You can have as many field additions out that you want. Your life points don't half when your ruler dies. And as far as I know there really isn't anything that would cut something in half for 50s to be pertinent.
FoWtcg,3bn64i,foxygrandpa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure which rulebook you are using, but if you're trying to use the rulebook that came with The Dawn of Valhalla starter decks, don't use that rulebook.  It's old.  Use the Comprehensive Rules, which is available on the Force of Will official website, or in the link on the right of this page, under Important Information.  1) Survivor of Heaven Castle does not gain +300/+300 when you attack your opponent's rested resonator as this scenario is not blocking.    Once the game reaches the Declare Blockers Step, if your opponent chooses another resonator of his/hers to block Survivor of Heaven Castle from attacking the rested resonator, then Survivor of Heaven Castle will get the bonus.  If your resonator has Target Attack, it may attack an opponent's recovered resonator, but that is still not considered blocking.  Again, the game has to reach the Declare Blockers Step, and your opponent must choose another resonator of his or hers to use as a blocker.  2) Morgiana's ability is a replacement effect as described in Rule 9.10 of the Comprehensive Rules (CR).  However, Morgiana's ability only replaces one draw effect at a time.  Your opponent used an effect to draw only one card, so only one of Morgiana's ability out of the three will apply.  The other two won't.    So, you're correct.  In order for your opponent to get what he wants, he needs to create three draw effects outside of the Draw Phase. Even then, for each replacement trigger, your opponent would look three cards from the top, pick one, and put the rest at the bottom of his deck.  Your opponent cannot grab 9 cards from the top of his deck all at once, take 3, and put the rest at the bottom of his deck. (i.e. he cannot combine the triggers together into one action; it's three actions)  3) Starter deck rulebooks are obsolete.    You can have any number of Addition: Field cards, up to a maximum of 4 for the same named card.    The loss of half your life for losing your J-Ruler is also obsolete.    The CR's change log at the end of the document indicated that those rules were removed, so you won't find any specific references to those old rules in the CR itself anymore.    For purposes of life point rounding, see Rule 1.5 of the CR.  You round up to the nearest hundred, unless the card text says otherwise."

Both CMF and TAT have cards that are used in competitive decks.  If your budget is 2-3 boxes (about $300), you may want to find a deck list of something you would like to play and buy the cards as singles instead.  Otherwise, if you're not intending to go competitive right away, my suggestion is one box of CMF and TAT each just to build up your card inventory with the understanding that you won't necessarily get a playset of everything."

For a locals his deck does way more than you need.  Edit: it also doesn't run thunder so that cuts down the price a bit"
FoWtcg,3bht6m,Lohrumes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:43:24 2015 UTC,How much would that deck run me?
FoWtcg,3bht6m,Lohrumes,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:20:43 2015 UTC,"Less than $150 at most, closer to $100 if you know the right places and how to trade up"
FoWtcg,3bht6m,werdunloaded,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:47:09 2015 UTC,"Well since I have nearly no cards then I probably won't be trading up, but I do have some green cards from my friend, do maybe I can save some money. I'd have to look later when I get home."
FoWtcg,3bht6m,Some1Random,2,Mon Jun 29 18:23:55 2015 UTC,"Total cost of the deck + stones would come to approximately $315. This is full price for a deck if you were to order it online. I rounded slightly up to give you a general idea and consider shipping and commons. The side deck is approximately $25.  A couple weeks ago you could buy this for 100-150 but some of the cards have since then skyrocketed (namely Fiethsing and Flame of the Outerworld, and Feethsing has gone up as well). It would be in your best interest to start smaller and work your way up, unless you're ready to buy into it.   If you wait until the end of July to buy everything, you might save yourself a lot since Thunder, Stoning to Deaths and the dual stones are getting reprinted."
FoWtcg,3bht6m,fraiyr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:24:45 2015 UTC,"You should try that 3rd place deck ;D It plays like a control/combo deck, it is really good against the top Abdul decks and Grimm builds, and its cheaper than decks that are running 10 special stones plus flames and thunder."
FoWtcg,3bht6m,Lohrumes,0,Mon Jun 29 14:15:00 2015 UTC,I would estimate somewhere between $100 and $150

FoWtcg,3bgco9,Spastic_colon,2,Sun Jun 28 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I am also a Magic player. The ""chase"" works very much like the stack, and priority works very much like it does in magic too.    Yes, after you draw, there is an opportunity to play instants and use abilities before you actually untap for the turn. For another example, if you have an untapped ""Little Red, the Pure Stone"" at the start of your turn, you may draw and then tap the stone to give a resonator the +200/+200 boost and then proceed to the recovery phase and still untap the stone while having a boosted resonator for the turn.    Yes, Little Red, the True Fairytale does double the attack and defence of any boosting effects, this includes Tinker Bell and all the Oz characters with their counters.    As for the attacking, If you attack with a resonator, and they declare a blocker, if you actually remove that blocker by bouncing it or destroying it, the attack still continues onto the original target. There is only one chance to declare a blocker for an attack as well, so if you remove the blocker they don't get a chance to try and block with something else.    After reading that question again, I think I get what you mean. So your asking if you attack a resonator and before damage the opponent uses something like ""Dream of Juliet""s flicker ability on it? Yes, that counts as a new creature, the attack no longer has a target so it will effectively finish, but whatever you attacked the resonator with will still be tapped, so it cannot attack again.    I hope that all makes sense. :)"
FoWtcg,3bgco9,Radiant-Paladin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:02:33 2015 UTC,Thank you! Are there any English rule books I can find anywhere?
FoWtcg,3bgco9,GrieVelorn,2,Mon Jun 29 01:31:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can play cards during Draw or at the first priority step of Untap before untapping your stones. It's really good.  Yes, it makes any Attack gaining effect double. So Tinkerbell would be gaining 400 per fairytale and same with Oz tokens.  So if your attack target was the creature initially, if it becomes removed from the battlefield your attack basically resolves without effect and you cannot re-declare.  So for the most part your knowledge should apply but there are a few minor rules differences. the first being continuous effects that applies to the board. (Blazer, Seth, ect.) In FoW Last Known information means that if there was a board wipe but blazer was on the board then everything will be removed from play. Same with something like Seth and a board wipe.  Also effects like Pumpkin Witch and Zero, they will apply to every creature from that point forward whether they were on the board before you played Zero or Pumpkin Witch or not.  Combat works the same for the most part(save for it being one on one instead of everyone swinging in and being able to attack rested resonators) but if a blocking resonator is removed then the attack continues as it wasn't blocked. So if you attack a player and they block with their own resonator and you remove it, then the player will take the attack damage.  And that's about the biggest changes for the most part. Another would be how Attacking and Main are fluid but that one is more apparent than the others."

You cannot bounce the creature before damage, like in magic dmg does not go on the stack and yes your magic knowledge will carry over because a large amount of the game is like magic and that's how I learned the game.

FoWtcg,3bgco9,Sparta2388,2,Mon Jun 29 00:51:41 2015 UTC,"After an attacker and blocker is declared, both players very much have an opportunity to use abilities and cast instants before damage happens. It works that way in magic as well, I don't understand where you are getting that idea from."

I just looked again to verify the site hasn't been updated and it looks like you fixed a couple  things... My main annoyances with using the site are:   Clicking the specific set under ""Browse"" returns no results. (It looks like this is fixed on computers, but on the full site the bug still lingers.) Search results are unsortable and seem to have no logical sort mechanism on them. This was a bigger issue when the specific set wasn't working, it still makes setting up a buylist frustrating since you have to use search functions to filter on buylists. There are CSS errors with your cart/checkout/login that made it difficult from time to time and instead got me redirected to Kijudo a few times.   I will say with these recent improvements it is mostly just minor inconveniences, and even when they were in full swing it only deterred me from using the site a couple times. There is a good chance I am just nitpicky since I work on cloud-based web apps.    As I said I always have had good experiences working specifically with you through the FB group, but had some issues with the website. I have gotten over most of the UI issues, but the current annoyance is the time it takes to get a buylist confirmed :) I imagine that is just because you are swamped with setting up for Regionals, but it is frustrating anyways."

FoWtcg,3bgvoi,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:28:24 2015 UTC,"The strength of Grimm is how versatile it is. Quite honestly, the only cards I've seen show up in absolutely every grimm list are Cheshire Cat and Etna- getting 4 cheshire cats can be rather pricey(its the highest value card in game) and they basically make the deck- so unless your willing to dump $120 on just grimm and 4 cats, you should look elsewhere.  But after that base its pretty versatile, Ramp grimm works, oddgro grimm is a thing, then there's also a new burn grimm deck.  Other than grimm, there's 4 different rulers(Pandora of Dark/Dracula/Abdul/Scheherazade) you can fit into the standard Green/Red/Black Ramp/Control deck. They all basically fit in Elvish Priest, Gretel, Fiethsing, Cake Zones, Xeex, Thunder, Flame of Outerworld, and then they kinda differ on the last 10 cards in the deck- usually fitting in black cards like Mephistopheles, Carmilla, Stoning to Death- and sometimes a Necronomicon(since in a top deck situation this card is insane)  Then there's also Grimmia, who has 2-3 different set ups. Which is Light/Red Grimmia which can tech in Split Heaven and Earth for some devastating plays- it also abuses Jean d'arc+ Gilles.  Then there's Green/White/Black Grimmia which is a ramp/control version that uses Whispers of the Abyss to get an easy Grimmia flip. And then you can arguably make a greedier version that fits in red and also uses thunder/flame of outerworld.  Finally, Bahamut Burn- there's both a monored version and a red/splash black version. Neither versions have showed up in top 8s at recent events, but then again I think their meta share is pretty small.  So all in all- if your playing a meta deck, they all run Thunder, so you're going to need 4 thunders which can range from 35-50 depending on where you look. Other than that, I think Red/White Grimmia and Bahamut Burn are the cheapest decks to build right now, as they don't have any other cards in those decks that run for more than $5 other than the ruler and the thunders."

FoWtcg,3bffxd,Glandriel,2,Sun Jun 28 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"Starter decks are sort of okay just to get an idea of how the gameplay works, but honestly, they all use cards that are largely illegal for tourney play in the states, and you can get a good feel for it just watching videos and tutorials. IF you really feel that a starter deck is going to help you, get the red deck. But otherwise, you can put that $20 into 4 booster packs instead.  What my husband and I did when we started was we bought a box, and then added on later with boosters. With the box, you are guaranteed at least 2 Rulers, and there is usually enough to be able to piece together something workable from the rest. If that's not something viable for you atm, you may need to buy the Ruler you need separately and then aim for the booster sets that would yield the cards you need.  What playstyle are you looking for? That would affect what Rulers you want to aim for (and therefore what boosters you want to pull from.)"
FoWtcg,3bffxd,plaidmonkey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:39:42 2015 UTC,Any playstyle would work for me. I have a lot of experience with varying playstyles in other games so I'm flexible.   I'm hesitant to buy a booster box before I've played a single match of this game.
FoWtcg,3bffxd,plaidmonkey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:49:13 2015 UTC,"Understandable. I do know that IF your LGS (or wherever you would be playing) plays the Origin format, the starter deck cards are permissible. If so, that may be an option, to at least get a feel for the game; just ignore [break] and get really sad (and simultaneously relieved) that it's the last time you'll see [explode]. :P I also don't know if they've got demo decks at your LGS; I know one of mine does, but I know not all will.  If cthulhus have piqued your interest, you definitely need to find Fiend of the Dark Pyre/Nyarlhothep and black/red dual stones; cthulhus are generally run as a black/red mill deck. Other than that... mostly just check out various deck profiles to see what you might need. I myself play rush decks (werewolves and musketeers), while my husband plays control (Lumia-- which may not be strictly control, but IS annoying as hell to deal with-- or Seer/Kaguya, which is ALSO annoying as hell.) I can say that because of the recent changes in how standby spells are played, Kaguya has gotten a lot nastier."
FoWtcg,3bf781,Kylvam,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:04:51 2015 UTC,Split heaven and earth is by no means underrated.  Everydeck meta deck is either grimm or running ramp+10+ counterspells. Everyone has made preperations for the card in their deck building.

I also don't like gardea.

FoWtcg,3bdr2t,DARKside227,2,Sun Jun 28 06:46:37 2015 UTC,"Substantially less expensive than mtg, at least at the moment.  Smaller card sets make it easier to complete playsets by buying a few boxes (unlike larger mtg sets that can leave you short  even after 6 boxes). Singles - while there are a few collectible ones at high prices - are affordable by comparison.  The game is new, so its not entirely clear how the company will be handling reprints and collectibility for cards that become format staples in the future.  Worth the price to experience the game for yourself imho."

Also I have play tested with Fina a bit and I have found her to be a bit weak. Simply because the 3 mana is a bit much since she is only a 4/4. Unless you can play 2 finas in 1 turn. Though my testing was limited so I say try it.  1 critique I would make is remove the Elvish exorcist and replace with wiseman of winds."
FoWtcg,3bd88f,Domain77,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:21:12 2015 UTC,Going off of what /u/Domain77 said In your elf deck I would also highly recommend that you side out the Elvish Exorcists for 4x line of Wiseman of Winds.  Wiseman of Winds in great in a Christie/Helsing deck because you don't need to worry about Wiseman of Winds eff to banish because you always control an elf card.  I would -1 Fina and +1 Gretel because getting mana to start dropping your Fina early is really key.  You also might consider dropping Evolution of Limits to your side deck for Familiar of Holy Wind to get even more draw power.
FoWtcg,3bd88f,DasPoof,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:40:29 2015 UTC,"Imo little red is a far better ruler for this deck. Get refarth out, flip- all of a sudden fina is a 600/600 giving all your other elves +800/800  Fiethsings are also pretty important. I know its a $10 card, but its a good card in general and becomes even better in an elf deck."
FoWtcg,3bd88f,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:29:02 2015 UTC,"The comments are confusing to me because Fina is absolutely bonkers. Although a bit pricey, the best thing that could happen here is 4x Fiethsing and 2+ Exceed. Gretel is an easy choice 4-of, and Bowman + Exorcist are strong but definitely sideboard cards. You could maybe utilize 1 of each to have options you can tutor up with Silver Bullet in a pinch, and Carmilla sees enough play that it'd be useful."
FoWtcg,3bdpo5,GReaper5,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:24:42 2015 UTC,"1) Resonator battles are handled one by one.  So, after each battle, the game goes back to the main phase.  2) Yes, if you manage to recover a resonator that attacked this turn, you can attack with it again.  3) The two resonators will deal damage to each other as per Rule 8 Battle.  Note, some resonators have first strike, so attacking resonators will deal damage first in that case.  First strike is only for attacking resonators; blocking resonators do not benefit."
FoWtcg,3bdpjd,DasPoof,2,Sun Jun 28 06:22:28 2015 UTC,"Based on what you've got going on...  Since you do have Gretels and you're using blue, I'd recommend using Voice of the False God (Costs 2, 1 blue one colorless) so you can sack Gretel for 3 cards. It's also an instant, so if someone's nuking one of your cards off the board, you can zap it before they hit and still get some draw out of it. I also like the idea of using Morgiana, since she only costs 1 and gives you an incentive for drawing; basically thinking of her as a compliment to Sinbad, because I like options.  To my knowledge, Djinn isn't used much. He's beefy, but you've got a lot of other things going on, so you could PROBABLY get away with not using him; if you're not using him, then I'd also nix Lamp. Cowrie is expensive, and I've really only seen it used in Kaguya decks (because she can play it for 1, and change the wording... really annoying deck to play against.) I also disagree with Christie as a sideboard option here. Her draw ability is very situational (must have exactly 5 cards in hand). Usually I see Abdul run with Scheherazade; if you go that route, you're going to want to run 4 green/black and Grusbalesta in addition to the 4 green/blue and Feethsing. If you decide to stick with Christie though, you may want to add in Moojdart, just as a failsafe. And then if you ARE running those 4 green/black, you can now use a bunch of the black cards. Stoning to Death is particularly something that could be useful.  Just my opinions, and I'm by no means an expert here. XD Just going by what I've played and had played against me; my husband also likes to play unconventional decks, so I've seen some things. o___o"
FoWtcg,3bdpjd,plaidmonkey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:52:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I'm still testing around with a lot of builds.
FoWtcg,3bdpjd,plaidmonkey,2,Mon Jun 29 15:30:37 2015 UTC,No problem! Looking forward to hearing what you go with. :)
FoWtcg,3bdpjd,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:08:14 2015 UTC,"Green/Blue isn't really being ran- for the most part blue is subpar in the meta at the moment, the only popular deck that uses blue is Grimm, which doesn't even run blue stones, it just gets to play Cats/Etna/Hamelin because of grimm getting to pay any mana for fairy tales.  Quite honestly, right now the top two decks are Green/Black/Red control and Grimm- Green/Black/Red control generally runs a similar base of Thunders/Flame of Outerworld/Ramp/Counterspells with some of the strong cards from black, but it changes based on what ruler you use- which there are a ton of viable rulers for it- such as Abdul, Scheherazade, Dracula, or Pandora of Dark.  Here are links to top 8 finishes from the last two big events to get an idea of what they look like.  UK Italian Open  ARG Edison  If you do still want to try a blue/green Sinbad deck, I would recommend taking out the Djinn/Lamp and maybe look into Chesire Cat and Swordsman of the Full Moon. I know cheshire cat is a expensive card, but if you want a sinbad shenanigan deck cheshire cat gives loads of options. Swordsman of the Full Moon on the other hand I feel is an underrated card in the current meta, a 900/900 with Flying is actually quite nice in the current meta as the only thing that really gets in its way is Mephistopheles, and it also survives Flame of Outer World, which is a card that is quickly becoming popular in the current meta.  Anyway, best of luck."

FoWtcg,3ba4ew,PinkXanies,2,Sat Jun 27 06:09:50 2015 UTC,Post board why not play a different deck entirely you know? Figure out what's going to be sided in against you and then change your deck up enough that doesn't really affect you. Granted this only works if you can guarantee a game 1 win.
FoWtcg,3ba4ew,JimWolfie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:22:13 2015 UTC,"Well I was thinking that as well. Side some gretel, fiethsing maybe a few more counters in exceed and some removal and maybe a good bomb like blazar although I guess you could try keeping in yamata. I think the issue in doing that is your mana is going to be a lot more weird than a deck built for that. You could also go maybe more of a beat down route because honestly those club soldiers and forty thieves have their damage add up over time while your opponent is saving spells to counter your combo. You could side out the combo and just go for heavy beats. There are so many options for this deck's side board it's actually kinda exciting."
FoWtcg,3ba4ew,tehchozen0ne,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:28:29 2015 UTC,Side in Ebony Prophet. Flip ASAP and use your active to turn off his beater.   A 200/2000 is a nice blocker lol  Abdul Jung DUMPS on genisis combo decks. That is why we haven't seen a single top 8 placing at a large scale tourney from it.

FoWtcg,3b9uqv,isador21,3,Sat Jun 27 04:13:14 2015 UTC,You don't get to recover during your first turn.
FoWtcg,3b9uqv,Sqewer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:30:43 2015 UTC,Aren't rulers naturally recovered on first turn? I'm looking for a specific rule that prevents rulers from using tap abilities on said turn. The latest comprehensive rules only mention a restriction for J-Rulers and Resonators (and also differentiate J-Rulers from Rulers/Resonators in wording)
FoWtcg,3b9uqv,Josuke_Higashikata,2,Sat Jun 27 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"As Sqewer said, you don't get to recover during your first turn. I think it's section 5.2 or something, but in really really awful Engrish it says on both players' first turn they skip the recover step.  ""If this is the first turn for turn player, skip recovery phase"""
FoWtcg,3b9uqv,MagicianLord,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:52:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can activate a Ruler ability if you play second, because Rule 9.5 doesn't mention the Ruler side. (Not to mention, you do technically control your ruler since the beginning of a turn; not so with a J-Ruler.)  However,  Rule 5.2 - Recovery Phase has a bullet point that says.   If this is the first turn for turn player, skip recovery phase.   If you play second, you don't get a Recovery phase either.  So, if you use Abdul's ability on your opponent's first turn, you can't recover it on your first turn, so you can't call a Magic Stone during your main phase."
FoWtcg,3b9uqv,Thor0106,0,Sat Jun 27 18:44:03 2015 UTC,I personally think Christie with her Draw a card ability is really strong. We're talking starting the game a card ahead of your opponent... in a green deck! It's gonna be pretty good.

Having to stretch thirty has pretty much proven highly improbable in all the drafts I've played. Twice I've had to run out of color unplayables.   No limit on stones. Some people like drafting the 1000/1000 deep sea stone grind guy.   Draft ruler or opened ruler is the best way. Proxied rulers is unbalanced.   Prizes are fine. My one LGS does $15 with no entry packs. 6 for 3-0, 2 for 2-1. The other does $15 for entry pack and $3 into prize pool with everyone getting a pack.   Can you do less than $20.

FoWtcg,3b65hc,awilkes777,2,Fri Jun 26 07:51:51 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the game, unfortunately I got some bad news, the starter decks are actually probably the worst place to start building a collection with, and the rules they came with are inaccurate- on top of the rule book with the starter deck having some errors in translation, the Lifebreak mechanic was removed from the game completely. Although for the most part those rules are the same, just with the lifebreak mechanic removed.  In addition to this the starter decks are built off of cards from the first cluster of the game which was released extremely limited in the west.  The game is currently in its 2nd cluster and the tournament format is looking to have a similar format to magic where modern is basically two clusters at a time. So buying cards from the current cluster is a sound investment for the time being.  Better news is next month has a bunch of stuff happening- a few regional tournaments are happening in the US, the last set of the current(grimm) cluster is coming out, and new starter decks as well as a deckbuilding kit.  The deckbuilding kit(known as vingolf: engage knights) is honestly a great place to start a collection as it will include two copies of every dual magic stone (which as singles go for $5+ depending on which one) as well as two copies of thunder and stoning to death- two staple spells for their colors that are also valued pretty well. Although the resonators in the set that have been spoiled so far seem pretty lackluster.  If you just want to build 1 deck to play well with and have fun with- same as any tcg usually you're best off just buying singles.  If you do feel like buying a box though, go for either Crimson Moon's Fairy Tale or The Castle of Heaven and the Two Towers. CMF has the most cards valued in the $10-15 range, while TAT has a lot of $5 cards and the most valuable card in the game, Chesire Cat. Moon Priestess Returns though only has two valuable cards in the whole set and doesn't have any dual stones, which drops the expected value of the box as a whole. So if buying a single box stay away from this one.  As far as good decks? Fowtavern has a nice collection of the metagame defining decks right here- Although like any card game there are plenty of other decks that can be built/ran and like any card game, the primary thing is building a deck you enjoy.  As far as a good budget deck? Building mono-blue wererabbit deck can be pretty easy on the wallet as far as buying singles goes- but its not all too good. If you want to build a cheap budget deck, I would probably go for mono-red Bahamut Burn- while you'd have to fork over ~$55 for the thunders and Bahamut alone as singles- the rest of the deck won't be all too expensive, and the 4 thunders can fit into just about any deck and often are."

FoWtcg,3b65hc,Josuke_Higashikata,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:20:37 2015 UTC,That is weird that no one seems to be talking about that event.  Definitely a good read.
FoWtcg,3b65hc,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:34:07 2015 UTC,If you really want to go all out you can purchase a box of The Castle of Heaven and The two towers and build a mono green OZ deck. Buying singles would be cheaper but if you get a box from that set you could pull some high value cards and make your money back. TBH the game's pretty new here so just spend some time on the sub-reddit and do a little bit of research with the googles.
FoWtcg,3b65hc,King_Oriax,-1,Fri Jun 26 13:15:07 2015 UTC,The best way to start this game would honestly be to wait just a little until the next special set and starters comes out. It's called engage knights and it will be by far the best way to immediately get into the game. Until then the best thing would be to get packs of the newest set Moon Priestess Returns and just start your collection going. Unfortunately the starter deck that you bought isn't usable in the current format that most people are playing in. But that's okay. It's pretty cheap to get into this game. You can even buy a player of every card currently out for about 800. But don't worry you don't have to be that crazy. Haha

FoWtcg,3b5cwy,King_Oriax,2,Fri Jun 26 02:38:12 2015 UTC,"If you want to play at Etna/Hamelin being your win conditions, then Grimm is just the better deck.  As far as this deck, its all over the place. Athos is pretty weak in here, the only thing he searches out is Crucifex- not worth running him at all. I get he's in here to boost little prince, but not sure if worth. I basically just see you building a weak grimm deck out of the cards you do have that could fit in grimm. So I just don't think its very good in that regard since its basically like you're gimping yourself.  Honestly, the strongest Little Red deck imo is the elf Little Red deck. Its really fun when it works because Fina essentially gives all your resonators +800/800 and all of a sudden you got 3 priests in play the size of mephistopheles- let alone your other elves.  Also on another note, if you're running green and would run Chesire Cats- just run Familiar of Holy Wind, cheap replacement that fulfills the same role of being a cycling 1 drop- and its really arguably better with the banish option, although the people who dropped money on their cats may want to argue against that."
FoWtcg,3b5cwy,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:31:34 2015 UTC,"Grimm does feel like he'd be a bit better but I like the doubling of buffs combined with giving a tin man flying/unblockable to do ridiculous amounts of damage in one turn though. I will drop the dreams for the familiar, It's not a fairy tale but It seems like it would be a better card to play. I completely looked over the fact that Athos would only grab crucifix, I thought he would grab the field spells as well oops. If I did switch to grim what other cards would you recommend looking at? EDIT: Maybe I should run tinker bell instead of Athos?"
FoWtcg,3b5cwy,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:49:12 2015 UTC,"Here's a meta list that gives a pretty good idea of how midrange grimm decks play from Fowtavern   [1] Grimm, the Fairy Tale Prince  Stones:  [4] Magic Stone of Deep Wood   [2] Magic Stone of Blasting Waves  [4] Magic Stone of Gusting Skies   Main:  [1] Dream of Juliet   [1] Rapunzel, the Long Hair Princess   [4] Tell a Fairy Story   [3] Hamelin Pied Piper   [1] Rat Catcher's Pipe   [4] Absolute Cake Zone   [1] Athos, the Three Musketeers  [2] Elvish Priest  [4] Gretel  [2] Law of Silence  [1] Grimm, the Avenger of Fairy Tales  [2] Pure Spirit of Fantasy(think this is supposed to be Aesop)  [1] Duel of Truth  [4] Cheshire Cat, the Grinning Remnant  [2] Witch's Dagger  [2] Glinda, the Fairy   [1] Oz, the Great Wizard  [4] Xeex the Ancient Magic  [1] Crime and Punishment   Side:  [2] Dream of Juliet  [3] Return to Stories  [1] The Emperor with New Clothes   [1] Hamelin Pied Piper  [2] Magic Stone of Wind   [1] Grimm, the Avenger of Fairy Tales  [1] Duel of Truth  [2] Savior of Splendor   [1] Crime and Punishment  [1] Etna, the Snow Queen   See the similarities it has with your deck? although I will mention in grimm Cheshire cat is noticeably better than Familiar of Holy Wind due to its synergies with Grimm.  I will mention I underrated how strong you can pump tin man in your deck- makes me wonder why your not running flying carpet with your goal in mind.  There are better ways to build your deck, and I think I'll work on trying to point you to a better list now- but at first glance I just saw  it looking like a wannabe Grimm Deck."
FoWtcg,3b5cwy,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:59:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah thanks. My first go at a deck was just a mono green with Little red and looking at this it does look like i'm trying to make an awkward version of a grimm deck. I do notice though that the grimm deck doesnt run the flying stone, is it not all that powerful or is it just not needed? And the pure spirit of fantasy isnt even a fairy tale, wouldn't you run Aesop instead since they have the same cost atk/def but Aesop has an ability"
FoWtcg,3b5cwy,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:03:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I just copy pasted the list, I think its supposed to be Aesop.  Grimm doesn't need Almerius because you don't need it because Rapunzel gives it, and usually the deck doesn't need it because it starts perma resting everything.  Also, I think mono-green is the way to go with your original deck design, I posted a list suggestion below."
FoWtcg,3b5cwy,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:26:27 2015 UTC,"If I were to retool this deck, I would focus more on the oz synergy- Oz is a great card that sees play just to grab thunders- I think that speaks volumes of its power.  That being said, if I were to retool this to make it more efficient with what your desired win condition is to succeed (Fly over them and hit their face with massive 1 drops) I'd probably make this mono-green deck.  Here's a suggestion list keeping the Tin Man/Little Red idea in mind.  Little Red  2 Cowardly Lion  2 Brainless Scarecrow  4 Heartless Tin Man  4 Elvish Priest  4 Gretel  4 Oz the Great Wizard  4 Refarth  3 Xeex  4 Cake Zone  4 Flying Carpet  2 Oz's Magic  3 Evolution of Limits  1 Little Red  1 Feethsing  8 Wind Stones  Yep, a mono-green rush deck. This thing is most likely god awful, but it can catch people by surprise and overwhelm them before they knew what hit them.  Why does it run ramp cards if you want to use the cheap cards? Because if you don't ramp out some counterspells the deck will fall flat on its face when your dude with only 1 counter on it gets hit by a thunder when you try to buff it again.  As far as how well running Dorothy/Silver shoes instead of the ramp cards would work? I think it would be worse, as this deck wins by trying to hit them hard before they can react, and what dorothy is good for is playing an extended game, which isn't the deck's strong suit I feel."
FoWtcg,3b4kz0,Fabled4ever,2,Thu Jun 25 22:35:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's how it works. Since the original target for the spell can no longer be targeted, the spell fizzles."

FoWtcg,3b4iuq,Kylvam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:18:26 2015 UTC,"Anyone else thinking of building a white/blue/green deck for sages? Maybe just white/green. I'm thinking djinn is a nice potential card for creating knowledge counters and aladins lamp could potentially be nice, since it can also search for the blue sage. Although im also wondering what the white jruler in the set does, because given that white seems to be the primary sage color the jruler will likely have some synergy with knowledge counters. -Actually, i bet the jruler side is going to have a continuous that lets you rearrange knowledge counters, seems kinda obvious.  And also i think this is how articles like this could be better. Rather than just analyzing the cards, it could be useful to just look at what kind of deck we could build with these cards. Right now, this article isn't all too much more polarizing than the article that revealed these cards- the only difference being yair not afraid to call out cards for being bad (which admittedly the official reveal article can't really do since they need to promote people buying the cards)  Admittedly, trying to build a deck with these cards when there's only partial spoilers is generally a bad idea since with the whole spoilers better options become clearer- but still i think its nice to suggest decks when talking about these cards because it just promotes discussion of the cards more than just analyzing the cards since really- most people are already aware of a cards standalone value/power when combined with other cards in the set.  Just my two cents, still appreciate seeing these articles though."
FoWtcg,3b4iuq,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:09:46 2015 UTC,"Also, to visualize the deck I was kinda talking about, here's a potential list (Obviously when the set comes out it could be better optimized with unspoiled cards- not to mention this list itself could be better optimized with known cards)  Ruler  Pandora of Dark- would probably be changed for a Sage synergy ruler if there is one  Resonators (28)  4 Elvish Priest  3 Gretel  4 Fiethsing  3 Cheshire Cat  2 Kaguya, the Tale of the Bamboo Cutter  4 Almerius  3 Moojdart  2 Djinn of the Lamp  3 Alice, Guardian of Dimensions  Spells (12)  3 Xeex  2 Exceed  4 Cake Zone  3 Dream of Juliet  Magic Stones (10)  4 Deep Wood  4 Gusting Skies  1 Feethsing  1 Almerius    Lets start the explanation of the deck with Pandora of Dark- admittedly this deck is only able to activate her with Fiethsings, but I still see Pandora as a nice part of the deck. This deck wins by building a board and being able to control your opponent completely between Almerius and Moojdart- with Pandora you're able to limit your opponent's options once you get near the complete board and as such can use the decks multitude of counterspells to really control the game from that point.  Djinn and Dream of Romeo are nice cards in here because you can use them to create knowledge counters by using their effects on Fiethsing- and the really nice part of that is you can rest Fiethsing to help pay their cost but comes back ready for your opponent's turn.  Kaguya I see as a 2-3 of in my mind as its essentially a win condition. At a certain point when you've built a good number of knowledge counters you can drop her and clear your opponent's board of blockers and just start swinging with everything for the game. But Kaguya is not a great turn 1 play in my mind, as having her down early doesn't usually do much as in the early game your too busy dropping sages to have the mana to put counters on them- and her body isn't all too strong.  But yeah, this deck is basically built as a grinder deck that doesn't really have a win condition other than establish complete control over your opponent- although admittedly there is little your opponent can do when you reach that point.  Some other thoughts I had were that I'm not all too sure how good alice is in this deck, she is a great card, but could Zero(white) be better? Zero white is only really going to be ran since she's a sage, but she does sort of accomplish a similar role since spending a knowledge counter on her allows you to outwit a thunder- so maybe I'm just overrating alice here- although alice is also the easiest potential out against Abdul since you can pay two blue will to essentially counter abdul's cancel effect., would have to test the deck. Flying carpet is also a potentially nice card in here, helps you start whittling your opponent down before you have complete control, and cycles.  As far as sideboarding Return to Stories and Savior of Splendor seem like they'd be good candidates- would also probably sideboard some more counterspells and maybe White Spirit to help against burn.  So yeah, that's just an example of how you could build a six sage deck as I see it."

Ame-no-Habakiri is likely going to have a huge impact on the meta- Susanowo can be sideboarded into anything to punish dragons- even without the discount he's far from a bad card.  This six sage is actually just in general a strong card when you see it  as a 6/3 for 2 that also has a enter of deal 300 damage- but more versatile than that. although its unlikely it will actually see play in a six sage deck, as from the other sages we've seen, they already have removal- although this sage does only cost 2 will, albeit 2 wills that conflict with the other sages.  -Then we have a flashback card that will probably not see any play. Little Red is pretty big, Granny is a really solid blocker and enables red to play anti-aggro better. With Flame of Outerworld, Thunder, and Crime and Punishment being as good as they are, I foresee Red becoming an even bigger part of the meta.  As far as vingolf, my expectations were already low, but at the same time Alexander actually seems half decent- but dies to Flame of Outer World so will likely not see play."

FoWtcg,3b1dk9,Fabled4ever,2,Thu Jun 25 04:33:28 2015 UTC,"When a spell is in the Chase Area, Rule 3.13 tells you the spell type.   It's called ""summon spell"" if the type is resonator, and called ""normal spell"" if the type is the other. If spells, abilities or effects refer ""spell"" without specific zone, they refer cards on chase area.   So, a normal spell is any spell that isn't a summon spell (i.e. casting  a resonator card)"
FoWtcg,3b1dk9,MagicianLord,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:41:42 2015 UTC,"Here's an in-depth answer that might help. Might just be over-explaining but if anyone else sees this I hope they find it useful.  Everything is a Spell once it's activated until it leaves the chase (until both players have had a chance to respond or add to the chase). When you attempt to summon any resonator, it enters the chase as a Summon Spell. Once the chase resolves and the resonator enters the field or goes to the graveyard, it is no longer a spell.   Similar process applies to every other card that's not a resonator. Addition:Resonator, Addition:Field, Spell:Chant, Spell:Chant-Instant, and Spell:Chant-Standby all enter the chase as Normal Spells. Cake Zone can chase to any of these cards to negate it. Once an Addition leaves the chase, though, it is no longer a Spell.   The only cards that are Spells in the Hand, Deck, Field, Banished Zone and Removed from Game Zone are Spell:Chant, Spell:Chant-Instant, and Spell:Chant-Standby cards. Everything else is its own type in those areas."

FoWtcg,3b0ffz,Alexsndr1992,0,Thu Jun 25 01:15:51 2015 UTC,"ok this makes sense to me, therefore play means ""put in the chase"" if its already there theres is nothing preventing it  Thanks"
FoWtcg,3b0ffz,werdunloaded,2,Thu Jun 25 01:22:20 2015 UTC,"If this helps: each time you activate a card, it goes on the chase (or stack/chain). Card effects don't resolve/take effect until players are done adding cards to the chase/are done responding.  Once both players decide not to add anything to the chase, each card on the chase takes its turn to resolve (in reverse to the order the cards were originally played) its effect and have its effect applied. So by the time Law of Silence's effect takes effect, cards on the chase have already activated so they are not affected by LoS. But spells after LoS's effect takes effect cannot be played."
FoWtcg,3azbf9,Dolono,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"I am not a big fan of cube, but I had considered it. The main issue I see is that I don't think they had limited in mind much when they created the cards. Power level is heavily based on rarity and for the most part I find the distribution lame.  The main issue with a cube is that there is really only ~300 cards right now. So if you wanted a decent sized cube you would basically need everything. On top of that a lot of cards just actually just unplayable without a specific ruler. I personally like the draft ruler and then letting people draft rulers in the cube. Mostly because I think everyone would just pick Cain and it would be a boring draft. Making the ruler part of the picks puts focus on the deck."
FoWtcg,3azbf9,Some1Random,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:30:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Netrunner is in a similar state, where the card pool is neither large enough nor deep enough to run a (good) singleton cube. After Visgolf comes out, I was thinking of combining that with the contents of either a set of the Grimm starters, or a pruned box of TAT or CMF. So the cube would likely run redundant copies of some/all commons and uncommons + visgolf stuff.  Is there anything problematic about just drafting a straight up booster box, balance-wise? Aside from the need to proxy some ruler cards?  Sorry, I'm really starting in the womb here!"
FoWtcg,3azbf9,Sniffygull,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"I'd say wait for Millennia of Ages and Vingolf if you're building a cube and then build one that drafts all of Grimm Cluster + Vongolf. Then I'd honestly go, 4 copies of commons, 2 of Uncommons, 1 each Rare and Super Rare, and 1 copy of each ruler. Cut out all the stuff that has weak generic effects, or need a specific ruler to really work (Inquisition, cough). Power level in FOW is heavily leaned on the Rares and Super Rares with many commons and uncommons not boosting you as much as they could.   Drafting a box is fine. Small set size means you get a bit less variance and have a good chance of seeing duplicate rares and such. So keep that in mind. Just print out the Draft Ruler is what I did with my friends. I much prefer a cross set draft is only to open the card pool. Doing a box of TAT and a box of CMF is pretty good. The LGS runs 2 MPR, 1 TAT, 1 CMF, and that's alright."
FoWtcg,3azbf9,Some1Random,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:50:59 2015 UTC,"Inqusition is a card that is actually great for limited, it is playable by a any ruler, but even better with Jeanne. However, things like Clockwork Apple Bomb or Stories told in 1001 nights or Seige Warfare are just unplayable in a formatl ike cube.  I think a cube is certainly possible, but I certainly wouldn't want to play it until a few more sets are out.  I have done a few drafts and honestly it is lackluster. It is weird and interesting since it is new, but seems all over the place and with the difference in power level its mostly whoever rips more rares/supers in their colors that wins."
FoWtcg,3azbf9,Sniffygull,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:39:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, bad example. Apple Bomb and Siege Warfare are much better ones. I'd say stories is fine in cube, first effect is decent, and a permanent exile if you draft Sharezad is also good.   Cube construction for FOW will probably always be good stuff cube. We have some themes, but even those are weaker than in games like MTG.   I don't think draft is too terrible. It's harder, that's for sure. Since it seems the game is designed without limited in mind. My big issue with it, aside from bomb power, is the way time works in FOW. I've gotten three draws out of nine draft games since they often go into time. The power level and synergy isn't there to play draft matches like constructed."

FoWtcg,3avfnt,anarchyinthegalaxy,2,Tue Jun 23 22:51:57 2015 UTC,It sounds good on paper but there are a number of decks which can recover from it. It also really relies on that J-Activate. Tested it at 4 different tournaments after seeing it and the results were underwhelming.
FoWtcg,3avfnt,werdunloaded,0,Wed Jun 24 16:38:15 2015 UTC,Yeah there's this strange concept called metagame. I don't know if you've heard about it.

I'm just sharing my experience from having tested the deck at several tourneys with some same and some different pool of players, i.e. different meta. If you'd like me to elaborate, let me know, but it's not necessary or useful to cast off opinions or info just because it goes against what you want to believe."
FoWtcg,3avfnt,werdunloaded,2,Thu Jun 25 01:47:31 2015 UTC,"interesting, I built a very similar deck except using Scheherazade. Didn't think that the hand discard would be super powerful.

The current plan is to have a 2 block rotation like magic has been doing, but right now we're still in the first block in the western release. The next set comes out next month, and there will also be new starter decks and a deck building kit coming out.  As far as a Black/Green Abdul deck, Most Greedy Control decks play around with Black/Green/White usually with the ramp base of Elvish Priest/Gretel/Fiethsing and can be ran with a variety of rulers- including Abdul."

FoWtcg,3auqw6,Nyte_Crawler,2,Tue Jun 23 23:00:49 2015 UTC,"Better than thunder, flame of outer world. FoOW + Grubelesta is just unfair as its an unchaseable 1000 damage, wins the abdul mirror right there.  Either way, abdul is so strong that you can pretty much build an abdul deck however you want. Although i will say in my experience i think black/red/green is definitely the strongest variety right now."
FoWtcg,3auqw6,Blank_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"I turtally agree with this comment! FoOW, has been seen as a much stronger card than Thunder. Thunder is however a very strong card and very viable.  My gripe with RBG instead of BUG is the lack of Cheshire Cats and Pide Piper. I have done some very dirty plays with these two cards and they can't be touched by thunder or FoOW. More than likely, your opponent has to 2 for 1 your cards."
FoWtcg,3auqw6,domBOT,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:46:26 2015 UTC,"Its very easy to find cards here in America, maybe you should find an LGS that supports FoW?  The game rotates almost the same as MTG. The first rotiation is in September of 2016.   A new set comes out next month and usually every 3-4 months. Investing is usually not smart in card games in general. Buying what you need is most likely the smarter option.  Abdul is probably the strongest J ruler after recent updates to the deck. I obviously havent seen your list, but hes a powerhouse."
FoWtcg,3asy30,King_Oriax,6,Tue Jun 23 06:47:21 2015 UTC,"Someone posted this last week and basically summed it up well. Right now pretty much no top tier decks are made out of cards from just 1 set- but that being said it is possible to build a decent aggro Wizard of Oz Deck from TAT (The Castle of Heaven and the Two Towers) In addition to that its also arguably the most valuable box since it has the unique stones, half the dual stones, and Cheshire cat in the set.  Crimson Moon Fairy Tale isn't bad either, has half the dual stones (including the $15+ deep wood), comes with 4 rulers per box instead of 2, and contains grimm, the most valuable ruler, as well as $8 cards such as Thunder and Carmilla.  But I would definitely say to stay away from MPR, buy singles if you need MPR cards- although Fiethsing and Flame of Outer World are exploding in value, but those are really the only highly sought after cards in the set, no dual stones to be found here."
FoWtcg,3asy30,Nyte_Crawler,3,Tue Jun 23 07:04:40 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, you won't be able to build any decks just by buying one booster box.  You might be able to put some semblance of a deck together buying one booster box of Crimson Moon's Fairy Tale (CMF) and The Castle of Heaven and Two Towers (TAT).  My recommendation to new players is to buy one box of CMF and TAT and then buy the rest as singles.  Value-wise, you can't go wrong with either CMF or TAT, because the set size is small, so you have a high probability of getting good or useful cards."

If you want to pay full-box price and grab the four thunders, $100 for a really viable deck.  Split Heaven and Earth is amazing in the current meta since so many decks are ridiculously greedy with their manabases. Just pick a red ruler and go to town."

I assumed we controlled an army per se, and our second in command was our ruler, with resonators being our soldiers. I think I assumed this from the way I was taught to play at the card shop. There was a small amount of lore in the Valhalla set, but it was just to describe the different attributes.

Kaguya 2.0 is sworn to fight the cuthuhu race as they pose great threat to all worlds, Little Red and Little Dread despise each other, and I'd imagine there are any number of reasons two copies of the same ruler would fight one another. Considering there are many different worlds, some containing the same species as other worlds, this theory is highly possible."

That is how it is presented in the official stories.  The fact that the player has life points that must be brought down to 0 is a game construct.  The player doesn't appear to represent anything other than a means to get to a win condition.  That said, the game is inspired by Magic: The Gathering and possibly EDH/Commander, so as huntj09 said, you could view the player as the leader of an army."

FoWtcg,3asofo,Myrrodin,3,Tue Jun 23 04:53:29 2015 UTC,"Morning! FWIW, I'm running a PnB deck and I've played around with a few things. Here's my impressions, take'em with a grain of salt because they go against the current meta, and what-have-you.    Musketeers have a slow, predictable build, and you need to either make your deck FAST, or make it so you don't have to care about what your opponent is running. With only 12 possible musketeers at maximum (4 of each) you're going to have to put some beef to the musketeer 'skeleton' of your deck anyway.  So anytime you add anything that's not a musketeer, you ask yourself ""does this make them faster? Or does this neutralize what's on the other side?""  With that in mind, I'd drop black entirely.  If you actually need necronomicon to churn back up your graveyard, then things are already going too slowly. Also, Siege Warfare 'costs' the same as Stone to Death if you put it into chant-standby, and it can destroy a J-Ruler. It's true that it's far more expensive if you play from hand, but if you really need to destroy things early, then things are not going well.   You actually don't need Gretel or Elvish Priest. Unpopular opinion, I know, but adding those to my deck have actually made it run ""worse"". Instead of spending Will to get the musketeers going, I had to start worrying about leaving it open for counters.  If you look at Aramis, he gives you one Wind energy for each musketeer you control. So when he's dropped you can play extra musketeers, or additions for free, without having to invest in other resonators that give you Will. If you're still invested in that then I recommend Feethsing instead, or actually, Gardea, since you're running a couple of Special Magic stones, and buff other resonators. I'm gonna try that this weekend!  My deck has Realm of Evolution. Glinda, and Dragonslayer, and every time one of those cards is played my opponent tries to take them out ASAP, because they're amazing. ;)  Dragonslayer turns little guys into GREAT blockers, and since it reduces 500 damage, it also helps absorb Thunder and Flames from the Outer World. Also..kill a dragon on entry, say what?! I've killed so many dragons with this.   Realm of Evolution buffs all fairytales, and when you're ready to dig up your last musketeer, you just drop a green and off you go. I went from having 2 of these in my deck to 3, and I'm honestly considering 4.   Glinda's enter makes one musketeer unblockable, and if you've flipped PnB, OR you've armed Athos, sometimes that's a K-O. Otherwise, you can banish her and possibly counter an opponent's spell for free. Honestly, in counter heavy decks, I've noticed that if my opponent opts to spend the extra 2 to negate the effect, that sometimes makes things even worse for them, since they're paying more for an effect that's not always worth the new cost.   If you want to keep Yellow/Light/White...w/e, then you probably want Aesop (to provide immunity), possibly Tinkerbell (cheap, massive offense), and definitely Genesis Creation, which will retrieve and put into field an Addition: Field, a resonator, and potentially a magic stone from your graveyard. If you do add I, the Pilot/the Little Prince, I'd drop in a couple of Sweet Roses and see how those work. Longinus could be pretty good sideboard, as well.   If you do drop Gretel and the elves, I'd recommend going the Tinman/Cowardly Lion/Scarecrow route. They're cheap, and they're great blockers that can get big fast while you build up your musketeers. I use Holy Familiar right now for my 1 drops, for the card draw and because sometimes you just gotta drop a cat bomb. My friends hate her too, lol.   Almerius is fantastic, musketeers are particularly weak to flying. Wish I had one!   For your sideboard (I haven't gotten to do this, let me know how it goes) maybe Little Red, the True Fairy Tale? Even without PnB, that plus +400 from the bayonets could be serious. I'd save Xeex for that, as well. I'd probably sideboard the silver stakes, too. Definitely consider some flying carpets, as well.   I came into FoW with a little bit of TCG experience from Pokemon, so I'm still learning the Chase. With that in mind, though, I can say if my first match is a curb stomp in either direction, then my next two matches tend to be pretty tense, even if the other person is far more experienced, or running a well-greased netdeck. I've killed a Cain deck on turn 3. I've dropped 4 Siege Warfares and blown a deck apart.   Final tips: Mulligan for Porthos. The 'optimal' order I've seen for these guys is Porthos->Aramis->Athos->More Aramis/Porthos.   Don't be afraid to take a few hits at the beginning if you need to hold onto resonators for the final rush, or you need to play support cards first.   Go crazy! I've put Dragonslayers on Aesop, the Familiar, Aramis,...sometimes just making your opponents waste their counters on your derp team is worth it. I've blown up multiple Familiars at once to destroy someone's biggest guy, or irritating flyers. The more familiar you are with this game, the more rewarding this 'strategy' seems to get, because you're defying expectations, and it usually turns into some really fun matches.   Let me know how all this works out for you. Hope it helps."
FoWtcg,3asofo,SailorPalaven,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you know this or not, but Athos can't grab Ragnarok out of your deck. Athos can only pull [Addition: Resonator] and Ragnarok is an [Addition: J/Resonator]  Other than that not too sure- ""I"" the Pilot would actually be a really good fit in this deck. The main mechanic to abuse with Musketeer's (Other than the flavor) is Pierce. ""I""s  enter effect allows you to rest a target resonator allowing you to create a target to easily dispatch with Musketeer's Bayonet. And by that extension you can also run the Little Prince, who also can easily get pumped up to a 1400 in this deck.  My other thought is I'm not sure if black is the greatest fit in this deck. As I said, pierce is a good mechanic to abuse with musketeers, and stoning to death isn't the greatest thing in your deck where your splashing black without fiethsing to boost the consistency of being able to pay 2 black.  Blue might be a better fit, with it in the deck you could also try Rat Catcher's Pipe, which as said allows you to abuse pierce by creating new targets- and can also be thrown on Gretel's. If you run blue Witch's Dagger also becomes an option to get some card draw in the deck, although granted this deck doesn't seem to need much."
FoWtcg,3asofo,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:45:28 2015 UTC,"SailorPalaven pretty much summed up everything I would say. I personally like being Light/Wind with a heavier push towards Light with Musketeers. The fact that Tinkerbell will ALWAYS be at least a 400/400 since Puss is in fact a Fairy Tale helps bring the early beats. Little Prince + I the Pilot are a great core as well. (And just in case someone asks, yes you DO control your Ruler at all times. Even if they are in the ""Ruler Zone"" they are still seen by cards like Tinkerbell and Wiseman of Winds.)"

If you just want to have some cards to test out how the game works and don't mind having 41 cards that aren't legal in a tournament setting, then by all means buy the currently released starters.  Any of the boxes (Crimson Moon's Fairy Tale, Two... Towers... it's abbreviated TAT, Moon Priestess Returns) are fine."
FoWtcg,3asccf,Josuke_Higashikata,2,Tue Jun 23 03:03:06 2015 UTC,"Referring to the banned game mechanics, there was a fairly large rule change between the first cluster and the second cluster, namely the removal of the Lifebreak mechanic. In addition to this, only like half the cards from the first cluster even came to the US and it was a fairly limited release. So the format is basically Grimm Cluster onward at the moment, and going forward a two block format is expected (similar to what magic has been doing up until their new upcoming rotation) The starter decks currently released are built from the first cluster, which isn't tournament legal, so you shouldn't bother with those unless you want to get some to familiarize yourself with the game.  Now, what should you start with? There's a deck building kit coming out next month known as Vingolf - Engage Knights. While most of the resonators(creatures) in it are crap, it comes with quite a few staples, such as 2 copies of Stoning to Death, Thunder, and Law of Silence- as well as 2 copies of each dual magic stone (which vary in price, most are $5-8, but deep wood is worth $15+ ea) Although granted the release of this kit will likely drive down these prices slightly.  As far as boxes, All Grimm Cluster sets have good cards, but Moon Priestess Returns (currently the newest set) probably is the least bang for your buck as the only really valuable card in the set is the misprint Cheshire Cat- in the other two sets (Crimson Moon's Fairy Tale; The Castle of Heaven and the Two Towers) have quite a few $5+ value cards, such as the dual stones and many staples.  But with any card game, if only looking to build a single particular deck or two, the cheapest option is usually buying singles rather than trying to chance into a good collection.  So TL;DR: New starter stuff coming out next month, but if you want to buy now, stay away from the current starter decks and buying a MPR box."

I'm not sure I get the point. I mean you have Blazer who is like top five Red cards. But you can't run common Cognates?   For the challenge, the deck looks suboptimal, but fine. Like a pile of decents. I can't really discern a real strategy there."

Regardless, the idea is Cain-Superstar. Ragnarok for buffing and general stupidity, butler to protect Cain, OIB for board pressure, etc. I was told to build a small strategy and go from there."
FoWtcg,3ao60f,SailorPalaven,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, being told to use a ruler and you can't use his special lackeys (the cognates) is..well. That doesn't sound fun, and I don't see how kneecapping you like that will take you ""outside your comfort zone""?   I'd drop a color to keep things simple, if you went Light, then yeah, Ragnarok+Queen's Butler is pretty good. I'd add Duel of Truth, maybe, Jump to the Sky....oh, and Joan D'Arc. Definitely. If you keep Blue and run Moojdart, you could turn him into a human and it will be the most frustrating thing ever.   After thinking about it, though, this will sound crazy, but maybe consider going Darkness? The J-ruler ability really left to you is ""pay Fire to do 200"" and doesn't even tap your ruler. I'd go Darkness and add Cinderella, Glass Slippers, Midnight Bell, Zero, and Demon's curse. Since you will probably get a stone each round instead of deciding to summon, you should be able to trigger Midnight Bell at least once by careful counting and watching game flow. Zero, Demon's Curse, and Glass Slippers all reduce resonators' stats as well. I'd add Vampire's Staff for slow life drain, and because she's pretty fierce if you put Slippers on her.   Basically, if your deck is R/D and you use Scorched Bales for your Red, and the rest Darkness, then the very worst thing that happens to you is you can't flip until turn 6,7, what-have-you, well you haven't built around Cain primarily and so you should be fine.  If that worries you, you could add Stones of Moon Shade and take the life hit, since he only needs Red once to flip, and the rest are gravy. There are plenty of times it's been in my best interests to take 200 damage to be able to have the Will I needed.    I don't know if any of that helps, but good luck!"

FoWtcg,3anhys,rodiqio,2,Mon Jun 22 01:51:34 2015 UTC,"Um..I'd sideboard all your yellow stuff, unless you're really just hung up on Dream of Juliet and Silver Stake. Tinkerbell is really good, so you could have a yellow sideboard for decks that're more aggressive than your Tin Man, etc can handle. Law of Silence is a really good green counter with the same overall cost, or you could drop the Cake Zones in. Every single one of your stones is a Special Stone, and there's a card running around these parts that will eat that alive.   If you're running Crimson Girl, then what you're after are things that will give your guys as many counters as possible, since it doubles their effects. Try to find some additions to put on your Tin Man, maybe. If you like Dorothy, drop her in instead of the Tinkerbells, and she can dig up silver shoes, more Oz bros, etc. Wind dagger would be a pretty good addition, and it gives you card draw like Cake Zone.   For red additions, you could add Kusanagi sword, or..and I'm not kidding here, promise. Bullet of Envy. You're already running Thunder, so what you do is watch your life, and then at a good opportunity (like when Glenda enters) add Bullet of Envy and then Thunder yourself. It sounds crazy, but it works and it's mean.   For the cost of 500 Life, you can get +1600 if Crimson Girl is flipped. And you get double your addition counter.  :3"

FoWtcg,3al925,hulkinghurler,2,Sun Jun 21 08:23:33 2015 UTC,"I will 100% say that no one really runs this kind of deck in Force of Will, and as such I don't have much experience with it. But the first thought I have is that more prime removal would be a good idea- only 2 Void Blasts won't be enough for most control decks who are running 3 Mephistopheles and tutors to get to it.  Other than that, it seems like an interesting deck that will catch most people off guard, but at the same time I don't think it has a good match up against the control decks in the meta. Mainly thinking Grimmia (both Control and Midrange versions) Abdul, and Schezerade.  But this thing has an amazing matchup against burn, and its Grimm Matchup also seems acceptable.  So with my above matchup thoughts, this kind of deck will just flat out not work against abdul, so you have to accept that and look at the other matchups. Dream of Juliet is a pretty strong white card, since it has a variety of uses.  It could be argued that Mephistopheles would be a strong addition to your deck, and it very well could be with all the recovery that exists and you seeming to generally flood the board with smaller minions.  Also, running 3 stones of Heavens rift could help consistency quite a bit. I realize that they're a bit pricier, but you could also fit them into more control oriented decks. Carmilla's as well. Carmilla would work quite well in this deck as it adds a body and removal at the same time. Not to mention with your prince + seth's you can reuse it. Also she's a 4 drop which you have none of, which is a small shame since you run the little prince.  Although granted you did say you're on a budget, and Carmilla's do run around $10+ But I will say they're well worth it, getting 3 if not 4 is just great to fit into decks that run black, which is to say pretty much the majority of Control Decks.  As far as Cinderella, I'm not completely sold on her, because the matchups she'd be strongest for you in I think you already have the edge on."
FoWtcg,3al925,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:13:57 2015 UTC,"One guy from my shop mentioned that I'd just be done in the matchup against Abdul, and I'd have to accept that and focus on boosting my other matchup strengths. Glad to see you agree there.  Dream of Juliet seems quite useful. I hadn't seen it before, but I definitely like it (even without Romeo and Juliet themselves!)  Mephistopheles seems good, yeah. It, too, is a four-drop so that could help out with Little Prince, I guess.  Would you think going up to 4 Void Blasts (and maybe 3 Zeros if I can get hold of another) would be beneficial?  Also, another crucial question: What would I replace if I put any of these things in?"
FoWtcg,3al925,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:30:56 2015 UTC,"The thing about void blast is i wouldn't bump it up without increasing zero. Stoning to death is the premier black removal spell as it removes any resonator for 2 black always.  Also, you run seal of grimmia. Bind of Gravity, a similar card that costs 1 black, is better than it in everyway.  As far as what to cut? Reduce the count on deadman prince, vampire staff, and/or white spirit. Alternatively you could try slimming up jekyl/hyde, although im not sure how important they are to the deck. Also, death sentence from the queen should also probably be cut down if not removed entirely to make room for more removal. As powerful as it can be, theres room for your opponent to play around it, and its also a more costly card than other direct removal options."

If Blazer is a summon spell in the Chase Area and is canceled (countered), it simply goes to its owner's graveyard.  If you discard Blazer from your Hand, it goes to your graveyard."

FoWtcg,3agezs,ftkaleh,3,Fri Jun 19 23:00:44 2015 UTC,"Witch's Dagger is put into its owner's graveyard.  Rule 7.2 for Additions says:   If the card is not [Addition: Field], it needs a target when he or she play it. The target must be a card in a field that have type X, specified with [Addition:X].  When addition card in chase area resolved, the addition card is put into its controller's field if the target of the addition is legal. If it's not [Addition: Field], the card is put into its controller field, added to the target. If the target is not legal, put the addition into its owner's graveyard.    So, when you cast Witch's Dagger, you must declare a target resonator. Witch's Dagger is now in the Chase Area as a normal spell. You pass priority. Your opponent then responds by activating Feethsing, the Holy Wind Stone and targeting the same resonator that you targeted with Witch's Dagger. Feethsing's ability enters the Chase Area. Your opponent passes priority, and you pass priority.  The Chase Area begins to resolve. Feethsing's ability resolves.  The targeted resonator now can no longer be targeted by spells or effects until end of turn. After Feethsing's ability resolves, you have priority.  You then pass priority.  Your opponent also passes priority. Witch's Dagger resolves.  It can't be added to the targeted resonator, because Feethsing's ability prevents it.  Witch's Dagger is put in your graveyard."
FoWtcg,3agezs,MagicianLord,2,Sat Jun 20 00:43:04 2015 UTC,The explanation for the chase is so good i would like more people to see it
FoWtcg,3agezs,nv77,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:46:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the compliment!
FoWtcg,3agezs,MagicianLord,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:06:12 2015 UTC,Thanks! We figured but we wanted to be sure!
FoWtcg,3agezs,ThePerfectWord,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:02:00 2015 UTC,"I agree it's a great explanation, but do you still receive priority once the Chase Area starts resolving? I thought you weren't allowed to respond to anything once it starts."
FoWtcg,3agezs,MagicianLord,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:17:29 2015 UTC,"After each spell resolves in the Chase Area, turn player has priority.  If turn player passes, then non-turn player has priority.  If non-turn player passes, then the next spell/ability is resolved in the Chase Area.  See Rule 6 Priority Sequence and look at the table that begins that rule.  Under ""End of Priority Sequence"" it says (emphasis mine),   If it's a consecutive passes by both player, resolve a card or an ability that's put last in chase area. If none in chase area, finish priority sequence. Otherwise, start new priority sequence.   Being able to give players priority after each spell resolution and ability resolution provides another layer of strategy.   For example, an opponent's spell may resolve which triggers an ability of yours that allows you to draw a card.  If that card you drew is a ""counterspell,"" once you gain priority again after a spell/ability resolution, you can cast that ""counterspell"" to cancel an opponent's spell that is still in the Chase Area."
FoWtcg,3agezs,ThePerfectWord,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:44:24 2015 UTC,I understand the strategic layer. I've played enough Magic to know haha. I just thought I remembered seeing a rule where players couldn't respond to resolutions in the Chase Area. I bet it was just an outdated version of the rules though. Thanks!

FoWtcg,3afc2y,JLubbs,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:50:20 2015 UTC,"This information is detailed in the Specific Floor Rules on the FoW Official site.   For Sealed and Draft formats:  If the ruler a player chooses isn't available, they may proxy  that ruler. A player using a proxied ruler must clearly explain to or show their opponent which ruler is the correct ruler for their deck. If ruler lists are available, it is recommended that player circle their ruler on that list to show the correct ruler they are using.     EDIT: Snifygull has pointed out that some stores have been receiving packs of an official draft ruler card called ""Clockwork Magic Furnace."" (http://force-of-will-tcg.wikia.com/wiki/Clockwork_Magic_Furnace).  If your store did not request this special card or has not received it yet, you will need to follow the draft rules specified in the tournament guidelines."
FoWtcg,3afc2y,MagicianLord,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:02:07 2015 UTC,This is old information. Now each player is given a Clockwork Magic Furnace. (http://force-of-will-tcg.wikia.com/wiki/Clockwork_Magic_Furnace)  Unless your LGS does do the proxy ruler version.

FoWtcg,3afc2y,Sniffygull,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"True. If they didn't get them then it's a whole different ball game. Honestly I'd call down and ask them if you can. Drafting one way or the other is wildly different. I'd also inquire as to their format. My LGS runs with 2 MPR, 1 TAT, and 1 CMF. Which I believe to be the proper format, but who knows!   I will say I've found people undervalue both Moon Stones in MPR, and that they are actually the best fixing out of all three sets in draft since your base usually ends up being three color."
FoWtcg,3afc2y,MagicianLord,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:27:53 2015 UTC,"I saw that, but I wasn't sure of its availability.  Note that not every store got that proxy card.  So, we're both right. I will, however, amend my post."

FoWtcg,3af0rn,grinningremnant,4,Fri Jun 19 16:24:17 2015 UTC,only having eternal formats kills games. Look at yugioh. If they are smart they will have different formats like magic does.
FoWtcg,3af0rn,Ghostinthecorner,2,Fri Jun 19 16:46:05 2015 UTC,"only reason it killed yugioh was because they decided to provide relentless power creep as a marketing strategy to obsolete other cards and force you to buy the latest stuff. I wouldn't mind eternal format support in FOW, just so long as it exists"
FoWtcg,3af0rn,Some1Random,2,Fri Jun 19 16:49:42 2015 UTC,"That is the only way to force you to buy new cards there.

Its not an ""unfortunate"" tactic it is what made it a force in the gaming community. There are multiple podcasts and papers with economists talking about how the standard format tournaments are what kept MTG from fading like a fad to a solid force for decades. Your players need a reason to keep playing and supporting the product. I would bet the producers of FOW understand this and that is why they are pushing the new frontiers format."
FoWtcg,3af0rn,Some1Random,0,Fri Jun 19 21:00:39 2015 UTC,"This is so wrong on so many level, its painfull to read."
FoWtcg,3af0rn,SurfBoy85,0,Sat Jun 20 00:57:22 2015 UTC,"I am sorry you find it painful, just speak the truth. Personally I think eternal formats are boring as shit (especially MTG, but to each their own). The lack of rotating formats also made a lot of other games fail when they could have done a lot better, so I am glad it is a thing.  Read up about the first world championship a bit and how that drove people to buy new cards."
FoWtcg,3af0rn,Some1Random,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:50:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're totaly right, rotating format are the best, like MTG standard, remember the time you had to play Mono black devotion or had 0 chance of winning the tournament? Or remember UW delver? Valakut? Caw Blade? Jund? Affinity? Faeries? Wolf run? God these one deck meta game were fun!  Rotating format are complete garbage, since there's not enought card to have healthy and diverse meta game.  But to be fair, i understand why standard or type 2, was a genius move, 15 years ago, when card game were not main stream like today, but time change, now everybody i know in magic are leaving standard for modern, more and more store have friday modern and not standard, etc."
FoWtcg,3af0rn,SurfBoy85,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:05:04 2015 UTC,"There is always a best deck. Caw blade and fae were the biggest warps, but both had short reigns before they rotated or had opposition. Personally I found legacy to be bland and when it is either a rock paper scissors meta or sharing 40 cards and calling it an innovation is lame. Modern is reasonable, but I prefer formats that change and cause you to look again at different cards and change the way you play.   Personally I like brewing and match ups that are more about skill than opening hand and match up.   As for player base. Legacy has the same 10-15 dudes each week while standard has 15-25, but people come and go. Modern can't even fire and fnm(draft locally) has 40-60 each week. So I think the fact that nobody is willing to get into a format that costs thousands makes it a poor choice to support."
FoWtcg,3af0rn,cXem,2,Sat Jun 20 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"Funny how you talk about skill when eternal format take way more skill to be played at top level. Standard are mostly about mirror match, and mirror match is all about luck since you have around 70/75 same card. Sure not all standard are the same, but in 6 years of magic i've seen 2 healthy standard (4+ deck in the meta), and they didnt last long.  Anyway all your argument are about personnal preference. When it come to stats and fact, eternal format are way superior to rotating's one. And for the price of modern and legacy deck, thats only because wizard is fck by the secondary market and the reserved list."
FoWtcg,3af0rn,MagicianLord,0,Sat Jun 20 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"Yugioh never died to having an eternal format. It's currently dying cause it is a block format. Even though you can use every set. If your not playing the most recent cards, you lose."
FoWtcg,3af0rn,Kitsu-ne,3,Mon Jun 22 22:16:52 2015 UTC,"The New Frontiers format is Force of Will's two-year rotation.  When Alice Block starts in September with its first cluster, Grimm block will still be legal until the first cluster of Alice block's successor is released (which is about another year later).  There is also an Origin format that is eternal (excluding Valhalla starter decks in U.S.) that will become viable after Alice block's successor is released.  Whether stores that hold sanctioned games will support the Origin format is another story."
FoWtcg,3af0rn,GrieVelorn,2,Fri Jun 19 17:46:20 2015 UTC,Why is valhalla not legal in origin?
FoWtcg,3af0rn,Kitsu-ne,2,Fri Jun 19 21:21:36 2015 UTC,"Because we didn't get the actual cards in the US. It's going to be dependent on what has released in your country. So the UK will have Valhalla legal, we won't. Not until they release it here at least."
FoWtcg,3af0rn,ReiXgh,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"Can I get an official source on that? Because in the official tournament policies it says that all sets are legal in origin, and that's  not segregated by region."

FoWtcg,3af0rn,MagicianLord,2,Sat Jun 20 19:11:42 2015 UTC,No they aren't. Unless you are in the UK. They were not released in the US so they aren't legal. The head judge of US Force of Will has confirmed this.

Mephistopholes can work, but i don't see how your meph is going to live a turn to swing at him- atleast not without them dropping their own meph to block at the least.  Crime and punishment is an obvious answer, although admittedly abdul players will rarely attack with him.  Also using thunder to trade up.  Bur yeah, the majority of answers to j/rulers are red cards."
FoWtcg,3acxg3,Soljur,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:10:06 2015 UTC,My plan for meph is to protect him with Alice. That's why there's 4 of her.

I will mention though, with the spirals you run this scenario becomes a whole lot more likely- so i will give you that."
FoWtcg,3acxg3,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:03:19 2015 UTC,"So, let me ask you this... can you chase Abdul's activate ability? Bc if you can (which is how I've been playing it), it's fine. He can't remove her abilities if he can't target her. Like, as long as i have Alice and 2 water open against him, it's manageable. And they can't burn her down our anything after that bc she's still hexproof. Sure, blow tons of resources, get me to tap out, and kill her on my draw step, that works."
FoWtcg,3acxg3,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"I really like the deck, in theory.  As a brewer, I love seeing decks without the standard green package.  I also really like the post board infinite Alice combo.  Seems a little cheeky, but oh so satisfying if you pull it off.  That being said, a few things worry me.  As has been mentioned, that is a very greedy game 1 mana base.  A Split would seem to decimate you.  I'm also a little concerned Grim will sort of overrun you too quickly.  Or even a turn 1 elf from your opponent.  Your only main board answer are 3 Slippers, which you will likely not have in your opening hand half of your games.  Likewise, your only other turn 1 play is somewhat less consistent, due to only 3 sources of blue (not including the mirror stone).  I read an article recently that advised having around 12 turn 1 plays, be it removal or otherwise, so you don't just get trampled by Grimm and the like.  I find that's fairly sound advice.  I do see the Cake Zones sideboard, which helps a bit against Splits.  The Pandora of Light confuses me a bit.  She just seems a bit slow in the matchups you would want her, but I have no practice with her, so I can't speak at all there.  The Dreams of Wonderland are interesting, cause I don't think you could ever fully go into an ""odd"" deck.  So it will ""just"" be a draw 1 for 1 sometimes, which seems less good, but not awful.  Anyway, just my two cents.  Fairly new to the game still, so it might all be wrong.  Best of luck!"
FoWtcg,3acxg3,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:24:01 2015 UTC,"so, the slippers along with the cindy's are taking a back seat. after reading what you said along with someone else's evaluation, i can see that they are sub-par in this shell, and that's fair...  also, i'm going to probably squeeze in swordsman of the full moon... but i need either more 1 or 2 drop removal or a solid 2 drop resonator... i used to run sleeping beauty of another version of this bc she's a 2 drop that doesn't die to thunder, but she doesn't do much past that... thoughts on that specifically?"
FoWtcg,3acxg3,Nyte_Crawler,2,Fri Jun 19 17:02:45 2015 UTC,"I don't hate the Slippers for removal.  I think the interaction with Cindy and Vamp Staff was a little hopeful, but Slippers kill most (if not all) 1 drops, and a large number of 2 drops.  Another decent one drop that Darkness has is Bind of Gravity.  It's downside is it is not hard removal, but its upside is, as long as it isn't removed, it stops even late game threats, like Blazer and Meph.  Unfortunately, a large number of early game answers come from Fire.  As do a large number of J-Ruler answers.  Some of your other 1 drop options would be Ebony Devil.  She's a 500/500, so she kills a lot in this meta.  The -200 each turn is a bit unfortunate, but it's something.  Holy Warrior of Hope is another turn 1 option.  For 2 drops you have Grimm, who is decent.  You can put in Mermaids of Tragic Love, who forces the opponent to block, trades with a lot of things, and also lets you draw a card when it dies.  The Little Prince seems like another fairly solid option.  A note on Grimm, the double light scares me a bit, so keep that in mind."
FoWtcg,3acxg3,Thor0106,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly- another option is fitting in lora and carmilla. Weaker on the t2 side, but helps thin your deck and allows you to search out another lora for next turn or just carmilla for the strong t4 tempo play."
FoWtcg,3acxg3,CupcakeDaddy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:55:06 2015 UTC,"This is fair. So, maybe I'll go up to 4 slippers for consistency then, take out Cindy, and go with lora probably at the two slot. The double white on Grimm isn't good the way i see it, bc everything in the deck is either black or splashable so that it stays on curve"
FoWtcg,3acxg3,RamboJezus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"You have several different ideas at work here that don't mesh together.  When you run Spiral of Despair, your ideal t2 usually becomes Spiral of Despair because your opponent will usually not be able to counterspell at that point and it will disrupt their options quickly. But when you t2 Spiral of Despair you then need to stablize quickly- you run Zero, so that accomplishes that, but you still need to quickly press for board control after that. Carmilla and Swordsman of the Full Moon can both accomplish that (May I add Swordsman doesn't die to Flame of the outer world)  Cinderella doesn't really belong in here because you don't run enough cheap drops to make the sac'ing worth it, not to mention making it a strong drop of 1000/1000 is actually a t3 play. And more than that both Grimm aggro versions have a way to deal with a slipper'd 2 drop, whether its Dreams of Juliet or Dreams of Wonderland.  I don't know exactly what to throw in to fix it, but my main concern is it seems really weak to aggro, and it definitely gets crushed by split heaven and earth, and I don't see how it beats Grimmia or Abdul either.  I could be wrong- but really, it just seems to fall flat against all parts of the meta game."
FoWtcg,3acxg3,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:33:02 2015 UTC,"how does it not mesh together?  it works just fine when i play it...  i do see your point about Cinderella tho.  and i have been having to sac herself sometimes to get the last points of dmg over from her ability... so, like, i wouldn't mind adding a some copies of Carmilla or Swordsman, but they are not two drops, so i have to make room for them elsewhere, and find a good one/two drop to replace Cindy.  i'll work on that... thanks for that tidbit  but aside from that, i found the rest of your assessment to fall flat... you have fine evaluation of individual cards in your comment, but the old ""dies to doom blade"" or ""deck A loses to deck B"" argument just doesn't hold any weight for me personally. of course there's always going to be a hole in any deck... that's building against a meta... you set yourself up to beat certain things and forego other matchups in your main deck...  i mean, i get it, everyone has their so-called ""knowledge"" of the established decks... but... it also feels like everyone has lost their critical thinking skills..."
FoWtcg,3acxg3,RamboJezus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but if your deck doesnt have a good matchup against grimm decks, abdul control, schezerade control, and bahamut burn- then i can't see why you would play the deck since those are the decks that are predominantly setting the meta.  If you had a good matchup against one or two of them, sure, but right now i don't see what meta deck you do beat since it looks like you won't beat the ramp of green splash control decks who will definitely have some xeex ready for your mephistopheles- who they know will be coming due to your black mana base.  Your mana base and small amount of healing leaves you very vulnerable to bahamut burn/split heaven and earth- although this is probably a favorable matchup in all reality since spiral kills burn- but you need the cake zones to block the split heaven and earth, so best of luck with game 1.  And against grimm decks you just seem way too slow. Alice is your key to beating them, but at the same time i don't think your deck will be able to create mana fast enough to support playing strong drops that you can also support with alice's blue active.  And as already mentioned, you have no way to deal with abdul, which will kill your deck full of synergy focused creatures.  Now then, i haven't seen your deck in action- and yes, i am a hypercritical negative nancy when it comes to card games. You are right that maybe all these 3 drops that don't die to thunder can be difficult for some opponents to deal with.  But i laid my doubts out above this post, so please. Clear them up about how you can win any of those matchups.  Edit: ok, i will admit, i forgot about spirals while writing this. The card seriously screws up a lot of decks, especially if you can play it early at a point where they can't cake zone it- and even later if unanswered it still screws opponents up. Due to the card i can seriously see this deck being pretty competitve- although i will still say my above criticisms are still valid."

FoWtcg,3acj6j,Some1Random,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:24:45 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it's not a good card, because its trigger requirement provides only a very narrow window of opportunity to play the card.  The card makes sense from a flavor perspective, but its playability is very limited."

Two rather important things were missing from the article though.  First off, it was missing an explanation of how you use your sideboard and what you sub out to fit in, and against what particular decks. And along those lines, notes for matchups.  Still enjoyed the article though."
FoWtcg,3a88i2,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:46:18 2015 UTC,Doesn't this deck get absolutely wrecked by Abdul control who can just turn off every single effect you put down?

FoWtcg,3a8shm,VodkaAlchemist,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:34:58 2015 UTC,I like midrange Pandora. You make it past turn 4 or so and most aggressive decks just run out of gas.   I'd like to say that awakening at the end seems like big game out of the side against aggro as well
FoWtcg,3a8shm,FauxHyperspace,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"As others have basically said, the Green/Black/White decks make the best control decks usually- but if you miss a counter on a split heaven and earth its usually game over.  Abdul is also pretty key to beating grim. Once you have abdul out, etna and pied piper are just bodies, which black usually has no issue with.  Also, if you want some strong antiaggro black cards, ebony devil and spiral of despair are really underrated. The only 1 drop Ebony demon gets  killed by is March Hare, making it a really strong 1 drop against Aggro. and spiral of despair causes Aggro decks to run out of steam even faster. If you curve those two and are able to get the turn 4 carmilla its usually a sign that the game is yours."
FoWtcg,3a7syi,King_of_you,6,Wed Jun 17 22:14:45 2015 UTC,You can't cake zone them. They are not being played. They are being put into play by kaguyas ability.
FoWtcg,3a7syi,foxygrandpa,0,Wed Jun 17 22:31:01 2015 UTC,"So the real question is, is there a response time from when they add x treasury items to hand and then equip to a resonator or whatever the case maybe"
FoWtcg,3a7syi,foxygrandpa,3,Thu Jun 18 00:09:22 2015 UTC,There is no way for you to negate them. The ability is on the chase. It cannot be negated. It will happen. Just have removal for it after it hits the field.
FoWtcg,3a7syi,foxygrandpa,-1,Thu Jun 18 00:15:24 2015 UTC,So even targeting with xeex or feethsing to make resonators untargetable wouldn't stop them would have to be a flame or thunder when they add to hand

There is no point where they go to hand. And targeting with xeex and fiethsing wouldn't stop this anyway. The ability doesn't target any resonator. Just puts things onto the field.

""Card legally add"" means a card in a field that type is specified in the subtype of an addition, and no effects prevent the addition to be added. If there're no such card, the addition stays in a zone currently it's in.  as opposed to 7.2. Play Addition  Turn player may play an addition card if he or she has priority, it is his or her main phase and chase area is empty.   The player chooses an addition card, pay the cost and play. If not specified, he or sha can play addition card in his or her hand.   If the card is not [Addition: Field], it needs a target when he or she play it. The target must be a card in a field that have type X, specified with [Addition:X]. ▶ You cannot target J-ruler in a ruler area with [Addition: J-ruler].   When addition card in chase area resolved, the addition card is put into its controller's field if the target of the addition is legal. If it's not [Addition: Field], the card is put into its controller field, added to the target. If the target is not legal, put the addition into its owner's graveyard.  the wording from the comprehensive rules for Playing an Addition and putting one into play are different."

FoWtcg,3a5k2i,Gannd,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:21:50 2015 UTC,I'd pick up a booster box of Crimson Moon's Fairy Tale. I think the starter decks are find to purchase just to get the rulebook and some cards. You'll never use the starter for a competitive deck anyway. A great thing with the game is if you get one booster box you get most of the cards from the set that you can pick up singles to fill out any missing/extras you need for your deck.   The meta because the card pool is limited is just around a few decks like nv77 said.
FoWtcg,3a5k2i,nv77,0,Wed Jun 17 13:08:21 2015 UTC,"Hi, I think the general consensus is that buying a booster box is the best way to start, as well as well TAT set (something about two towers) being the one ""where the money is at""  Also you might wanna wait for the new set coming out in july Vingolf-Engage Knights it will be a ""cheaper"" seeded (not sure if is the right word, but is not random) set which has some staple cards it has 2 copies of each dual stone therefore 2 of them will give you a full set of all dual stones and some other staples such as thunder.  On the meta, FoW is fairly new but as i've heard in the few tournaments it seems top decks are either Grimm decks or Schezerenade control decks (might be misspelled)  Edit: Punctuation"

Also I just remembered the most complicated thing for deck building is getting your J-ruler, in my opinion is what you might want to buy as a single, as it is crucial to your strategy, either you buy one with synergy for the cards you got, or try to build around one"

FoWtcg,3a3afl,Sniffygull,-1,Wed Jun 17 02:06:04 2015 UTC,Keep in mind misprints of Cheshire Cat can be found in any of the sets I believe for sure MPR and TAT but unsure about CMF. Best of luck on pulling her(:
FoWtcg,3a3afl,GrieVelorn,3,Wed Jun 17 04:01:02 2015 UTC,That is wrong. The Full Art Cheshire can ONLY be found in MPR. TAT has normal Cat but only MPR has full arts.

FoWtcg,3a3afl,CupcakeDaddy,2,Wed Jun 17 13:20:48 2015 UTC,In case anyone isn't aware Massdrop typically takes 3+ weeks to ship items out to you after the drop has ended. This is just a vote for the drop so if it succeeds a drop will open and you throw money at them and wait usually for 3+ weeks. (I waited over 3 months for my Ultimate Guard Flip'n'Tray). If these things aren't at a deep discount the drop won't be worth it. Read ~$30 shipped for Vingolf. If it is $40 shipped just go to your LGS.
FoWtcg,3a3afl,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:23:32 2015 UTC,The wait doesn't seem worth it. I'd want to use the cards as soon as possible for tournaments.
FoWtcg,3a3afl,hensomm,3,Wed Jun 17 13:25:06 2015 UTC,Yeah. I'm not sure who has used Massdrop around here before but I feel like everyone should be alerted that it is as its best when you're buying products that are difficult to obtain within the United States. Like backpacks from Norway or previously Ultimate Guard items (while waiting on the shipping they became available in the U.S). If you can go down to your LGS or buy it off Amazon you are much better off abstaining from ordering anything off Massdrop.
FoWtcg,3a3afl,Sniffygull,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:31:33 2015 UTC,What kinda prices can we expect on this?

Valhalla is confirmed to be NOT legal for Origin when it becomes a format. So unless you are playing with a group of people who don't care, it's not going to be worth picking them up."
FoWtcg,3a4rt0,GrieVelorn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:59:07 2015 UTC,"Doesn't origins specifically say you can use any cards released?  The only difference between bifrost and valhalla is life break?  Can you show me a link or something, saying that you can't use valhalla cards?  Just curious."
FoWtcg,3a4rt0,Some1Random,2,Wed Jun 17 09:13:34 2015 UTC,"From what Matt Kozmor said despite origins being every card released, valhalla wasn't technically released in the US so all US Origin format tournaments will be Grimm cluster forward unless they print Valhalla here."

FoWtcg,3a4rt0,xKozmic,3,Wed Jun 17 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, Matt Kozmor and Head Judge USA here.   Valhalla cards will of course always be fine for casual play with your friends.  However, unless the company releases a ""all-in-one Valhalla set"" in the USA, Valhalla cards will not be played in origin. As Germany and a few other areas are entering the game, for the hopes of a world-wide supported Origin format it would make the most sense to start from Grimm Cluster forward from a card availability standpoint.   We likely wont find out any more information on this for another ~15 months, but I will be pushing for a world-wide supported Origin format so everyone can be on the same page."

FoWtcg,3a3lxs,RoboGunner,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:12:26 2015 UTC,While i agree that stoning to death is really only feasible against mephistopheles i would not suggest taking them out unless carmillas are put back in. there needs to be an answer to the mephistopheles once it hits the board.
FoWtcg,3a3lxs,FauxHyperspace,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain to me why ""destroy target resonator"" isn't feasible in a game with resonators...?"
FoWtcg,3a3lxs,charmanderaznable,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:37:17 2015 UTC,"In a format with Feethsing, xeex, exceed, cake zone, etc flame of outerworld being split second is just much better than what stoning to death provides.    I definitely think it should be 4x flame of outerworld, 2x stoning to death and yes I also agree that this should be playing 2-3 Carmilla"
FoWtcg,3a3lxs,FauxHyperspace,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, i can understand that to an extent. Split second as a mechanic is never bad. I think the dark/fire cost is a little prohibitive to other darkness strategies tho. Know what i mean?  But by saying it's the best option, that means you kinda have to play red/black in some way... and since the green counters are good you also have to play green... so the whole format becomes jund decks with different rulers...   Sorry to launch into a convo about the format, but, this made me think. Tcg's have become slave to speed of information and using what others have done. A lot of people forget that while there are ""good"" cards and whatnot, the results you'll see online are always from a vacuum. Let's say top 8 from whatever tourney will have 5 Grimm decks, therefore it must be the best right? Nah, that's not what that means. Grimm is good, but it just means 5 good players brewed up Grimm decks and did well that day. Evaluating the card choices is wildly important. For instance, someone plays a sweet 1 of in their Abdul deck that wrecks a tournament, is this the new tech? Should you play that 1 of now too? Should you play 2 copies to make it more consistent? No, probably not. Bc that person made a real meta choice that paid off. If you run the same thing in your local without reevaluating, you'll probably get a different result. But this process is what the community has now deemed as acceptable or expected... ""oh, you're not paying grimm? Then your deck is probably bad""  So, leading back to the spell in question, is flame of outer world good? Yes, absolutely. Is it right for this deck? Maybe so... is it better than a straight kill spell? It's situational at best. So, You probably got it right on splitting like 3/4 and 2. Bc yeah, It's not 100% all of the time.   I would like to see more critical thinking out of the community when it comes to the format. We get too comfortable with ""what's best"" and playtesting doesn't mean what it used to.   I'm done ranting like a crazy person now haha! Hope i didn't tick anyone off"

FoWtcg,3a3hxp,MagicianLord,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:10:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does, per Rule 2.5 and rule 10.9:  Rule 2.5   Race or trait itself doesn't have any specified rules, though it is referred by some abilities  and  effects. If  an  effect  refers  race  or  trait  without  any  zone  it's  in,  it refers cards in a play ground with that race or trait.   Rule 10.9   To  destroy  a  card  in  a  field  or  magic  stone  area,  put  the  card  into  its  owner's graveyard if it's not J -ruler. If it's J-ruler, move it to its owner's ruler area"
FoWtcg,3a1zjk,metsmonkey,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:36:22 2015 UTC,"Not a bad starting point but can be a little slow against hyper aggresive Grimm decks and mono red Cain/Bahamut decks. Wererabbits are in a wierd spot where a lot of the cards seem to synergize well on paper but lack a little something in practice. All that being said it looks like a solid starting point considering you only started a week ago. I would suggest changing the stone base somewhat, you probably don't want Magic Stone of Moon Light because flipping them back to back on the first turns of the game puts you really far behind, I would try some basic water and fire stones as well as a Little Red the Pure Stone if you can get one. Destructive Flow isn't the greatest I would probably swap it for a 3rd Rabbit Kick and a Crime and Punishment. After you get some games in you'll probably want to rework the creature base a little but what you have there is a fine starting point. Hope all that helps"
FoWtcg,3a1zjk,BadW0lfGaming297,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:02:47 2015 UTC,"Why is flipping back to back moonlights bad? Each one would look at the other and say ""you COULD produce any color"" then itself produces colors (at least that is how it works with reflecting pool in magic and how I was told by someone who plays).  I was wasn't sure how much I would need flows once I got my rabbit kicks, so they are prob near the top of the chopping block. The other creatures that I am unsure of are the archers (since I don't have a critical density of rabbits) and etna (powerful effect, but not sure it is what the deck is needing). Are there any off-color chants that would be good to run with the updated chant rules?"
FoWtcg,3a1zjk,BadW0lfGaming297,2,Tue Jun 16 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"2 Moonlights next to each other each see that the other can produce moon will and will only produce moon will until another stone that produces colored will comes into play, this is the correct ruling in FoW (as well as the rule for reflecting pool in MTG a judge told me at a PTQ when I started playing)  You definitley don't need Destructive Flows with the Kicks, the decks that Flow would return things against won't typically care because most of their things are cheap and often have haste. Archers can be good but it really does depend on the number of wererabbits you have, I would say 12 other rabbits would be fine for her but it will need testing. What specifically do you mean by updated chant rules?"
FoWtcg,3a1zjk,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:00:49 2015 UTC,That is 100% not how reflecting pool works in magic. If you ever actually played competitively you would understand that. There was no chant updates. You mean chant-standby update.
FoWtcg,3a19rf,C1ock,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:11:03 2015 UTC,"40 minimum main deck, 10-20 stone deck, 15 maximum sideboard.  Edited main deck maximum after re-reading the floor rules."
FoWtcg,3a19rf,Some1Random,2,Tue Jun 16 13:19:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the official ruling. What is recommended for let's say a light and water deck for stone count?
FoWtcg,3a19rf,Some1Random,0,Tue Jun 16 18:06:43 2015 UTC,As with every tcg you generally want very close to the minimum. I haven't had a deck go over 41 main or 12 stones and there usually have to be good reasons to go over
FoWtcg,3a19rf,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:27:17 2015 UTC,You can have up to 15 cards in your sideboard. The 0 or 15 thing isn't true.

FoWtcg,3a19rf,Some1Random,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"This is wrong, it is just like MTG. You can check the floor rules here: http://fowtcg.com/pdf/FOW_floor_rules.pdf  However, I am wrong in that you can have more than 60 cards in your main deck. 40 card minimum any number maximum. Here is the exact text from the floor rules:  Main deck consists of 40 or more cards. There is no upper limit. It will be improper to include less than 40 cards.  Magic stone deck consists of at least 10 and up to 20 cards. It will be improper to include 21 or more cards.  Sideboard consists of either 0 or 15 cards. Any number of cards except that will be improper."
FoWtcg,3a19rf,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:43:54 2015 UTC,"You're wrong please stop spreading misinformation. It is just like MTG. You can have a sideboard of a maximum of 15 cards. We've actually gone over this before. Copy and pasted. http://fowtcg.com/pdf/FoW_TCG_Specific_Floor_Rules_20150528.pdf In Constructed events, side decks can contain a maximum of fifteen cards. Side decks may contain ruler cards and magic stone cards as well. The combined main deck and side deck may not include more than four copies of any card. The combined magic stone deck and side deck may not include more than four copies of any special magic stone cards. Non-special magic stone cards have no limit and can be included in any number of copies"
FoWtcg,3a19rf,Some1Random,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:57:52 2015 UTC,"Looks like they changed it in April. Also I assume at some point since you mention it being similar to MTG that MTG changed it as well?  It is odd that they would have 2 conflicting sources on their main page, but whatever."
FoWtcg,3a19rf,RamboJezus,0,Tue Jun 16 14:17:21 2015 UTC,I'm totally aware. Games change. If you're interested in giving advice or rules information perhaps you should ensure you're giving proper advice. As I stated before I've already gone over this rule.
FoWtcg,3a19rf,Some1Random,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:21:06 2015 UTC,I got the information straight from a document on the official FOW site and this is an almost irrelevant tidbit of information since people either don't know about sideboards and have 0 or have a full 15.   Congratulations that you have gone over this once before. Probably because it is confusing that it is said both ways on the official site.
FoWtcg,3a19rf,Higgle_Wiggle,0,Tue Jun 16 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"In regard to the number of stones you should run, it entirely depends on your main deck. If its a mono color deck, I'd personally only run 10, but make sure you play a few games to make sure the amount feels right.   For your sideboard, it must be 0 or 15 according to the rules, nothing inbetween. Not all decks require a sideboard, but it's nice to have one just incase after you've figured out your deck. Chances are there will be something that your main deck can't handle, even if you see it rarely. Anyways, thats my 2 cents."
FoWtcg,3a19rf,RamboJezus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:14:16 2015 UTC,Super wrong. Did you even read this thread? Sideboard is anywhere between 0 and 15.
FoWtcg,3a19rf,Higgle_Wiggle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:05:34 2015 UTC,"Read the rules, it must be 0 OR 15. If your going to begin to comment on every post I make on this subreddit I will contact the moderators."
FoWtcg,3a19rf,RamboJezus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:06:23 2015 UTC,You said it must be 0 or 15. Which is not true. Your sideboard can be anywhere between 0 and 15. You could have 3 cards in your sideboard if you desired and for the record I'm going to correct people when they try to spread misinformation in this sub 100% of the time. Perhaps you should read the rules. http://fowtcg.com/pdf/FoW_TCG_Specific_Floor_Rules_20150528.pdf

If they are enforcing rules that aren't in accordance with the actual official rules that FoW has then someone should notify whoever runs ARG tournaments so that they can fix their errors.    That picture isn't any sort of official rules document. That is just a decklist sheet. It is very possible they just happened to be using old ones(heck it could be an old picture the rule was changed back in April), which seems to be far more likely than them being in direct conflict with the official rules. Either way it is fairly trivial. No serious player ever opts to have less than 15 cards in their sideboard by choice."

Come July, we get the next box, a starter deck, and the Vangulf stuff, which is a box set of staples(IE, dual color stones).

Played that for awhile and then played Yugioh, but only for a few sets in the early days. After that, the YuYu Hakusho card game was one I played quite seriously but it died out quickly. Around this time I was also into Warhammer 40k and a Warhammer 40k card game came out....it was awful. Alongside all of this I also played Pokemon of course and have played that throughout the years until the Black and White sets. Then I played the Spongebob Squarepants card game, but it inevitably died. Next, and for many years, I played the WWF/WWE Raw Deal card game. It was such a good game, and I still miss it. Eventually, around 2008 Magic took its hold on me and I played for many years off and on, depending on the state of the standard format. Does Hearthstone count? I like that game. Played a few mobile card games as well, but they are a big waste. Finally, in these days, I play the new DBZ Panini card game, but it is stale at the moment, so FoW is my main game. Also, I should say I dont think Ive ever played a game as great as this game. It's amazing and I love it.   edit: I forgot to add Lord of the Rings card game and the Legend of the Five Rings card game."

FoWtcg,39ps7c,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:12:23 2015 UTC,Blazers ability is a continuous ability and if you bothered to read the rules you would understand how continuous abilities work.
FoWtcg,39ps7c,Mimic94,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"I did.  9.1. Ability and Effect  An Ability is the paragraph of sentences on a card to do something. Abilities are ""continuous ability"", ""activated ability"" or ""automatic ability"".Continuous abilities are abilities with text ""[Continuous] <effect>"" that is not a triggered ability. Continuous abilities apply their effect as long as the abilities are active.  Automatic abilities are abilities with text ""[Continuous] <effect>"" or [Spell : Chant - Standby] cards, and need to meet any condition or [Trigger] to play. They're played in the next priority sequence as the triggering condition met.  Blazers ability becomes active as soon as he leaves his players hand due to the ""from anywhere"" text, whether or not he actually enters the field.   If he's countered, sacked, killed, or whatever else you want to say/do, if he touches the graveyard, he's removed from play. His continuous meets the condition, therefore, it follows through.  Saying blazers ability doesn't happen because he doesn't hit field completely nulls out Spriggan from the Valhalla cluster's continuous. Standard may have changed, but the core rules, not so much.  If you still don't believe me, I will email the company and ask myself."
FoWtcg,39ps7c,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:07:06 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you're trolling or not. Blazers ability is referring to cards that would be sent to the graveyard while he is in play get RFG'ed regardless of where they are sent to the graveyard from. It is not referring to his own ability. I don't know how you thought that. Blazer's ability only works when it is active. You also apparently don't understand the difference between an Activate ability and a Continuous ability.  Literally just below what you copied and pasted explains when an ability is active.    9.2. Active Ability  Each ability can be played or apply its effect as long as it's active. If not specified, abilities are active as long as the card with them is in a zone below: ▶ Abilities on J/resonator or addition are active while the card is in a field. ▶ Abilities on ruler are active while the card is in a ruler area. ▶ Abilities on magic stone are active while the card is in a magic stone area.  If an ability has a text that is available in specified area, the ability is active in the area.     and just a bit further down...    9.4. Continuous Ability  Continuous abilities apply their effect as long as the abilities are active.  All the effects of continuous abilities are continuous effects.  If a continuous ability on a card defines attribute, race, trait, ATK or DEF of the card without any condition, the ability is called ""base ability"" and applied in any zone. ▶ Abilities with ""Treat this card as (attribute) magic stone"" text is base abilities.    and just a bit further down for spriggan... 9.5. Activated Ability  Activated abilities are abilities that controller of them may play them at any time he or she can play it.  Playing activated ability follow the rules of playing abilities.  Activated ability of resonator with included in required action can be played if it's in your playground continuously from the beginning of this turn.  Activated ability of J-ruler with included in required action can be played if it's in your field continuously from the beginning of this turn"

FoWtcg,39ps7c,Zelio12,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:41:30 2015 UTC,"While duel of truth seems like a great idea, I would probably only have 2 in the deck. What you need to do for the deck (for the fire portion at least) is burn small amounts frequently and as quickly as possible. Hunter in the Black forest is an excellent example of that. A large majority of fire players play him because he's a 3/3 one drop with swiftness.   RULER POWAA: Being an avid Snow White player myself, I like to make sure that I j-activate fairly early. If you are playing a Blazer, don't j-activate until about turn 5. That way, you can play one of your strongest cards, but you also don't have to worry about tapping Snow when she's activated, because with Target attack, A tap to rest, and a discard apple for destroy target resonator. She is also the beefiest babe in the Grimm cluster with that 1300/1300.  STONES: In my mana stone deck I have: 2 Heat Ray stones, 1 Little Red The pure stone, Milest The ghostly flame stone, and the rest are normal fire. Even though I play a mono-red, theres still useful info for you here: The heat stones have white already :D(BONUS TIP: Snow's J-activate can be activated with white mana, meaning you can save one apple for some extra enemy resonator death >:D), the Little red can be tapped for an extra +200/+200 until the end of turn, and Milest will give that extra +200 damage that you need (for the extra cost of one more fire D:) In your case, however, you may want those stones, in addition to an Almerius (completely optional, but the added flight effect is fun, especially on a Ragnarok'd Little Red. Imagine, a flying lady with a giant sword. Beautiful!) Then I suppose, fill in the rest with basic stones based on the ratio of Red to White cards in your deck!  BASIC IDEA:   4x Hunter in the Black Forest - Quick Damage 2x Little Dread, The Fake Red Moon - Strong play, multi effects 1x Blazer, The eater of dimensions - 11/11 swiftness, can be played from the removed area :D 3x Beowulf, the Blazing wolf - Captain Damage dealer 2x Seven Dwarves - Hard to fight a turn two 7/7 2x Forty thieves - Get some cards you need when you need em? Or you can discard Blazer to the removed area, yey. 2x ""I"" The pilot 2x Little Prince - For the combo with ^ 2x Abel, The avenger of gods - Board wipe, Target attack 1x Speaker of creation - to pull some Addition: Field cards, or destroy one >:) 2x The emperor with new clothes - Just a strong all around card, that gets rid of enemy's pesky addition: resonators. 7/7 cost of 3   SPELLS:   2x Ragnarok 2x Duel of Truth 4x Poison apple 2x Basket of little red - kind of like a 5 & 6th apple draw chance, but if you need an apple in a pinch, this is bae. 1x Realm of pure spirits - Your recovered resonators safe from spells and abilites your opponent controls (meaning it works against j-rulers abilities as well) 2x Purifying fire - 1000 to human, or 700 to opponent. (okay sub for thunder) Otherwise replace with 4x thunder. 2x Longinus, - +500/+500 protect from dark spells and abilites, good for beowulf! 2x Book of genesis, you really only need like 1, but its an awesome card, and you want more chances to draw it.   You dont have to make this deck exactly, because honestly most of this is theory and prior knowledge of the cards, as far as being in a deck I'm not 100% sure. I know you'll put up a good fight though. I hope that I helped a little bit, as far as just understanding game strategy and deckbuilding goes. That being said, just play tons of games with whatever deck you build, find out what isn't working and what you need, if you lose too fast, add more counters, or more aggro fire, if you find yourself being trounced before fire can burn them, just add some light spirits for +500 or something to that effect. Not too sure if you have the same playstyle as me, so just find out the strategy that works for you! :D Hope I helped!"
FoWtcg,39ouvs,Fizjig,2,Sat Jun 13 09:22:40 2015 UTC,"This is going to be a little long, so I'm sorry in advance.  Also, these are just my opinions, so take them as you will.  If you are running mono-blue, I would recommend trying to run something like Little Red, the Wolf Girl.  Especially with mono-blue Wererabbits, the deck looks to be aggressive with Archer of the Crescent Moon, and Alice's presence feels a little underwhelming.  However, I know that you are new, and Alice is by no means a bad J-Ruler, so you are definitely OK with that.  As for the deck, I would recommend cutting Dreams of Wonderland and Alice's World because they feel like they don't belong in the deck.  Dreams of Wonderland feels too weak if you can't guarantee the cost of your top card.  Also, in a deck where you are mono-Wererabbit, I can't see a scenario where an 8-cost card will ever not be a dead draw.  To replace them, I would really love to see 4x Knight of the New Moon; the card is so good as a discount draw engine, plus it serves as another Wererabbit.  I just remembered that there is also Pale Moon to buff Wererabbits, plus the bounce effect is pretty solid.  When you can get them, I think subbing these in for Glimpse of Kaguya would make the deck feel more forward-moving.  TL,DR: Creature base looks good, but having fewer spells will help the deck feel better.  Also, Pale Moon is pretty good."
FoWtcg,39ouvs,GreatGatesby,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:24:19 2015 UTC,I agree with this. These are just the cards I currently own. I will be looking for the ones you mentioned.

I call the deck ""Alice, Down the Fan Service Rabbit Hole""  Alice, The Drifter in the World  2x Magic Stone of Moon Shade  8x Magic Stone of Water  4x Pilot of Universe  4x Dark Shining Swordsman  2x One Inch Boy  2x Yang Mage of Decrescent  4x Archer of the Crescent Moon  4x Yin Mage of Increscent  2x Dreams of Wonderland  2x Alice's World  4x Tsukuyomi, The Moon City  4x Glimpse of Kaguya  4x Witch's Dagger  2x Rabbit Kick  2x Shooting Star  One Inch Boys are filler Until I can get copies of Swordsman of the Full Moon."
FoWtcg,39ouvs,tehchozen0ne,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"If you want to play Wererabbits, you want to invest in some CMF packs, or atleast get the singles. the 2nd set in the cluster didnt have any wererabbit cards, but the first and 3rd set did.  Campanella of the Milky Way Moon and Pale Moons are fantastic for wererabbit, and singles of those shouldn't go for more than 2.50 online. Swordsman of the Full Moon is definitely a rabbit you should pick up- because quite honestly, its the only wererabbit that stands alone as a great card that gets ran in decks other than wererabbit. singles for those usually go for 3.50ish.  Other than those, Hamelin, the Pied Piper and Etna, the Snow Queen are two other really strong Mono Blue cards you should consider, although they're not wererabbit, they're still excellent cards.  Also, the Moon Will synergy is a new player trap. The cards that synergize with Moon Will are generally subpar, and similarly its not usually worth it to build towards Moon Will cards.  In my Wererabbit deck, I think it ended up as more of a monoblue with a wererabbit complement, the only rabbits that really stayed were x4 Pilot of Universe, x4Archer of Crescent Moon, x2 Servant of Kaguya, and x4 Swordsman of the Full Moon. Other than that, the deck had cats, campanellas, some etnas, and x2 Hamelin-  Although it is possible to run a list that's more pure wererabbit- still with Campanellas to fish out the pale moons- because it can come out pretty explosively, but at the same time it can easily be shut down. Either way though, Tsukuyomi is a junk card and Moon Wills I'm still not too fond of, but it can still work.  Either way, if you want to build a decent wererabbit deck, definitely get Swordsman of the Full Moon, Campanella, and Pale Moons- If you buy as singles I think x4 copies of each should run about ~$25usd in total.  Also, I would agree with Gatesby, generally the best ruler in wererabbit is Little Red, as mono blue plays tempo in FoW, and Little Red is a very tempo oriented Ruler. Also as he said, the alice cards are not too good in rabbits because as he said, Dreams of Wonderland is inconsistent unless you build an odd deck, and Alice's World can be a dead card, which while it can win the game, in a tempo deck you have to think if its worth having a potentially dead card in your hand. Glimpse of Kaguya is also not too good in rabbits, as usually you don't let things with strong actives sit on the board long enough to use them- its honestly a pretty situational card in general and is pretty much blue splash sideboard material right now.  Either way, Good luck."
FoWtcg,39ouvs,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:00:09 2015 UTC,"I was able to trade and make a ton of changes to the deck. It now has a lot of the changes you have suggested here.   My one big question is how do I deal with decks that run Abdul Alhazred, the Harbinger of Despair. His abilities seem to shut Rabbits down instantly. Not only can I not play ""Enter"" effects, but he can turn off the abilities I have on the field.   That one card seems to wreck my entire deck.   Same goes for the shitty infinite Rapunsel attack combo. I keep losing 3rd turn to that deck. I can't seem to find an answer to it."
FoWtcg,39ouvs,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:23:44 2015 UTC,Can you explain the infinite turn 3 combo you're consistently losing to?
FoWtcg,39ouvs,PrimalMadness,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:41:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty sure its someone your playing with not understanding the rules.  Abdul is tricky, as mono blue there isnt much you can do to abdul, it's just a really bad matchup, as you often pay for bouncing against carmilla and mephistopholes, and as you said, you get restricted. If you splashed red you could possibly do some stuff, but with all honesty the black highend gives mono blue enough troubles that its hard to try to win against abdul other than just taking a quick win- which can be difficult."

FoWtcg,39l1zb,gruntmods,3,Sat Jun 13 06:24:28 2015 UTC,Right and cards like this might need some errata.  Basically a lot of the rules are semantics games. Gotchas that they didn't notice. It happens in all new TCG's sure but overall most people are just looking for something poorly worded to take advantage of.

FoWtcg,39l1wl,MagicianLord,2,Fri Jun 12 15:18:13 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have a new printing of TAT cards, because prior versions were without card text (other than the card name and type) or the card name was in Italian due to a printing error.    All the new full art cards spoiled recently have full art and text superimposed on top without the box (i.e. Pied Piper).  Needless to say, this card is potentially worth much to speculators, collectors, and players looking to decorate their deck.  If you're going to sell it, don't sell it for too little."

FoWtcg,39l1wl,MagicianLord,2,Fri Jun 12 15:50:26 2015 UTC,"I don't participate very much in market speculation, so it's hard to say if your version would be worth more than the previous full art cards.  I would guess that your card is worth at least what the other full art printings sold for.  I would be surprised if your card was valued significantly less than the previous full art printings.  I would recommend going to eBay and doing searches on ""Magic Stone of Deep Wood full art"" (or something along those lines) and then in the left column, check off ""completed auctions.""  That will show you a list of recent sales of the full art Magic Stone of Deep Wood cards.  You also have a good point that if you play this at regionals, you will get some people's attention, since it's never been seen previously.  But, once you start playing with the card, it isn't ""near mint/pack fresh"" anymore, so it would take a hit in its value if you were going to sell it afterwards.  You could also frame it and put it up on the wall or in a display case. :)"

FoWtcg,39la6x,zeven81,2,Fri Jun 12 15:02:06 2015 UTC,"The Castle of Heaven and Two Towers probably has the most value right now.   It has ""Cheshire Cat, the Grinning Remnant"" It has ""allied"" special dual magic stones. It has Magic Stone of Scorched Bales, the second most expensive stone on the singles market. It has the true magic stones. There is a small probability of getting full art cards of dual magic stones.   Crimson Moon's Fairy Tale has good value in general.   Average of 3-4 Ruler cards per box as opposed to TAT's 2 per box This has the ""enemy"" dual magic stones. It has the Magic Stone of Deep Wood, the most expensive of the stones on the open singles market.   If you need to build up cards, 1 box of each is a good start.  Unlike many other card games, the EV on both of these boxes is quite good."
FoWtcg,39la6x,MagicianLord,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:46:24 2015 UTC,Isn't the full art just a correction on misprints? Or is the full art the misprint?
FoWtcg,39la6x,MagicianLord,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:48:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand your question. From all the anecdotes I have heard, you have a small probability of getting a full art version of a magic stone.  These full art cards are intentionally inserted into booster packs, just like the ""god packs"" you may have also heard about.  So, they are a bonus surprise to a lucky customer.  These are not mistakes.  Originally, with the early printings of TAT, some of the full art stone cards were in Italian instead of English.  That might be the ""misprint"" you have heard about.  But, from what I heard, it was always the company's intention to produce and insert these full art cards randomly into boosters."

It could still be like a quiz, but instead of card text, you would present the user with a typical scenario, and ask which is the correct result. For example, lots of beginners (myself included) think that 'Oz, the Great Wizard' can search for 1 cmc resonators and additions. (He can't.) Or, what happens when a normal attacking resonator is blocked by a resonator with First Strike? (Nothing, First Strike only applies to attacking resonators, not blocking ones.) Etc. There are LOTS of gotchas for beginners, and such a quiz-like site could draw a lot of interest, especially if there were a way for more advanced users to submit sample questions and answers."

Out store has 7 players, 4 dedicated and 3 just starting, let's see what happens, from the other store we had 5 players come in yesterday. We talked a bit and though we wouldn't commute to something small, cause it's 8 hrs, but for bigger events, like the Houston regional, we will drive for."
FoWtcg,39icbf,Sniffygull,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:33:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's bascially the strongest card in the game. No other card at this point can heal that much damage for only 2 Will at once. You are going to have to change will base or run green and hold onto your cake zones.   It's kind of there to punish greedy people but at the same time it borders on just being so strong you almost have to run it. It's the reason we see the top decks we do. SHAE filters out fair decks and the ones who beat it are generally Odd Grimm and Abdul Jund."

I'm probably never going to get rid of my SHAEs because of 3 people in our group who like to run 3+ colors.

FoWtcg,39htlw,crobledopr,2,Thu Jun 11 20:29:41 2015 UTC,So will you be focusing mainly on construed or will you also focus on limited formats? Set reviews? Ect...
FoWtcg,39htlw,Sniffygull,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:53:26 2015 UTC,"Yes to all of these. Both your hosts come from a MtG background of playing both constructed and limited.

FoWtcg,39hzdy,Nippontora,4,Thu Jun 11 21:06:57 2015 UTC,"""Engage Knights - Vingolf"" is a standalone fixed-card boxed set (no booster packs).  You get 5 Ruler/J-Ruler cards (mono-colored) and a bunch of cards that support those Ruler/J-Ruler cards.  This is the ""deck builder's toolkit"" you have been hearing about.  It supposedly includes non-foil dual Magic Stone cards (2 of each combination) and some staple cards.  This is NOT a main set, but it is legal for tournament play in the Grimm Cluster format.  This product comes out in late July.  The retail price is $49.99, but I hear that you can pre-order for slightly less from some vendors.  Also, in late July, a 2-player ""Alice Cluster"" starter deck will be released. This features cards from the Alice Cluster due later in the year.  It's a Light deck vs. a Fire deck and is supposedly modeled like MTG's Duel Decks.  Its price is about $25, and again, you might find it for slightly cheaper.  Note that this starter deck is NOT the same as the one being released in Italy.  Lastly, the final set of the Grimm Cluster will be released in late July as well.  This is part of the mainline set.  36 booster packs per box, etc."
FoWtcg,39hzdy,MagicianLord,2,Thu Jun 11 21:41:54 2015 UTC,Extremely helpful thank you very much
FoWtcg,39geap,FauxHyperspace,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:26:13 2015 UTC,You can't play resonators during battle but you do battle then return to main phase where you can play resonators. You may repeat this as many times as you have legal resonators to battle with. If you declare battle then forfeit the attack you can no longer battle again during that turn.
FoWtcg,39geap,RamboJezus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"So, after each time you attack, you get another main phase, in which you can play stuff, and then battle again if you have a legal attacker. But when you decline to attack the turn is over. Just to be sure I'm understanding this perfectly"
FoWtcg,39geap,MagicianLord,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"The battle phase is conducted one resonator at a time.   You play resonators during your main phase, but unless they have [Swiftness], they won't be able to attack until your next turn. If any of your resonators can attack, you declare battle and attack with one.  You do battle ""stuff."" After that battle ends, you are back in your main phase.  Now, you can cast more resonators, cast spells, put cards into the Standby Area, or initiate another battle with another legal resonator of yours.     As for your other question:  In CR version 5.1, if you have a Chant - Standby card in the Standby Area and...   its trigger conditions are met you did not just put that card into the Standby Area this turn   then you can play that Chant - Standby card without paying any Will or having the correct Magic Stones.  That means you can place any Chant - Standby card into your Standby Area simply by paying {2} Will of any attribute.  This means that you can use Chant - Standby cards that don't match the ""colors"" of your deck."
FoWtcg,39geap,MagicianLord,2,Thu Jun 11 16:25:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, i follow. Then why do standbys have will costs?   Thanks for the comprehensive answer btw"
FoWtcg,39geap,Rez_TR,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"No problem.  As to your follow-up question, in CR version 5.1, a new rule was added to Chant - Standby cards.  From Rule 7.9 (I have bolded the relevant text):   [Spell:  Chant - Standby]  cards in hand  or  in  chant - standby  area  become  triggered when you reveal the cards at the time their trigger condition fulfilled. To play [Spell: Chant - Standby], as its cost to play, perform actions shown on the [Trigger] text before colon. You also need to pay the cost of the card if you play it from a zone other than your chant - standby area.   (EDITED after Rez_TR's comment): In other words, you may now play Chant - Standby cards from a zone that's not your Standby Area if the trigger condition on the card is met at any time, but you must pay the attribute cost on the card.   The Chant - Standby cards always had attribute costs, and originally, under the old rules, the attribute cost told you how many Magic Stones you needed to control (not pay) to play a Chant - Standby card from the Standby Area.  Since the rules have now changed, I am guessing the company didn't want to make a new set of Chant - Standby cards without attribute costs and just made new rules to make the cards work the way they are currently printed."
FoWtcg,39geap,MagicianLord,2,Thu Jun 11 17:06:15 2015 UTC,I thought said said you were able to play triggered chants at instant speed from removed areas and not just your hand
FoWtcg,39geap,MagicianLord,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:30:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did say that.  You can also play Chant - Standby cards from other zones, such as if you were using ""Necronomicon"" or ""Lumia, the Creator of Hope.""  Sorry about that. For purposes of this person's question, I left my statement as casting Chant - Standby cards from your hand, but the above two cards (and rule 7.9) make it possible for you to play Chant - Standby cards from other zones.  I went back and edited my post."
FoWtcg,39geap,MagicianLord,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. Okay. So, take Call of Cthulu for example. As long as there are 5 cthulu resonators in my yard i can play it for a Darkness and 1 from my hand any time i have priority... Or pay 2 to put it face down under the same scenario and as long as its not the same turn, i can play it for free essentially?"
FoWtcg,39ge8t,TheThackattack,2,Thu Jun 11 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"[Target Attack] is a poorly worded ability.  It does not target.  So, you can't use ""Breath of the God.""  (Note that ""Breath of God"" is a different card entirely.)  In the CR, Rule 11.2, Target Attack is defined as:   A J/resonator with [Target Attack] can attack against recovered J/resonator. This is continuous ability."
FoWtcg,39ge8t,MagicianLord,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going to elaborate on this. Below are the rules for picking an attack target.  The Attacking Player decides his/her Recovered Resonator or J-Ruler that will be attacking, and the target of its attack. The attack target is either: (1) The Defending Player; and (2) The Defending Player's Resonator or J-Ruler that are in Rest Position.  Therefore, the resonator with [Target Attack] is in fact targeting another resonator. However, Breath of God doesn't stop basic attacks and [Target Attack] is not an ability that targets a creature, it is a passive that allows a resonator to target any resonator that is recovered or rested."
FoWtcg,39ge8t,AjAyIGN,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:58:25 2015 UTC,"Unless this is new information, I can't find anything in CR version 5.1 that indicates the attacking player must ""target"" a resonator or player.  This is the passage I found.  Rule 8.2 Declare Attack Step  Turn  player  choose  to  attack  or forfeit  to  attack.  If  he  or  she  forfeits,  this  battle ends  and  go  directly  to  end  of  battle  step.  If  he  chose  to  attack,  he  choose  the  following:   A recovered J/resonator he or she continuously controls from the beginning of  this  turn.  If  he  or  she  controls any  J/resonator require  to  attack,  you  need  to choose one of them. For  an  attacked  object,  an  opponent  player  or  a  rested  J/resonator  in  the opponent's field.   The wording here indicates ""choose"" which in Rule 10.13 is basically ""picking something.""  That isn't the same as targeting, unless poor translation strikes again."

FoWtcg,39dnua,AlipheeseXVI,3,Thu Jun 11 01:39:57 2015 UTC,"1) No   2) You can sacrifice those types instead of paying the top left cost or you can pay the cost to summon it normally.   3) No  4) You can't tap it the turn you activate but you can the next turn to summon a stone or attack.   5) ""Cancel Spell"" counters all. ""Cancel Summon Spell"" counters resonator summons. ""Cancel Normal Spell"" counters spells, instants, additions etc."

FoWtcg,39dnua,RamboJezus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:44:01 2015 UTC,Like I said in the post I started this with 2 boxes not the intro packs and goggle searches I do on rules are hit and miss x-x
FoWtcg,39dnua,MagicianLord,0,Thu Jun 11 04:18:24 2015 UTC,Check out the comprehensive rules in the sidebar on this subreddit.
FoWtcg,39dnua,MagicianLord,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:03:50 2015 UTC,"1) No. You cannot target your own reasonators with your resonator that has [Target Attack].  2) [Incarnation] allows you to banish (sacrifice) resonators that match attribute types instead of paying the normal Will cost to cast them (i.e. don't need to pay using Stones).    Cards with additional, optional costs for extra abilities that can be paid upon casting, such as [Awakening], must still be paid if you want to use those abilities.    Note that with [Incarnation], ""multi-colored"" resonators can only be used to satisfy one of the [Incarnation] attributes.  If a Resonator summon spell has ""[Incarnation] Fire, Water,"" you need to banish two separate resonators.  Even if you have a resonator that is both Fire and Water, you cannot banish just that one resonator to satisfy both [Incarnation] requirements.  You need another qualified resonator to banish.  3) No.  4) You cannot call a Magic Stone with your J-Ruler in the same turn that you J-activated your Ruler.  If you J-activated, you have to wait until your next turn to call a stone.  5)   ""Cancel spell"" counters any spell in the Chase Area. ""Cancel normal spell"" counters only non-Resonator spells in the Chase Area (Additions, ""Chant - Spell - Instants"", ""Chant - Spell"",  ""Chant - Spell - Standby"", ""Regalia""). ""Cancel summon spell"" counters only Resonator spells in the Chase Area."
FoWtcg,39ba86,Twelvecarpileup,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know how I feel about Engage Knights anymore. On the one hand, it is cool most of the cards are pretty shitty because you won't be required to buy the set if you already have duals and what not. On the other hand I was hoping the cards that were in here would shake up the meta a bit.  I could see potential for a couple of these, especially Vlad, but for the most part the cards are really under-par."
FoWtcg,39ba86,Some1Random,3,Wed Jun 10 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"The standalone set was marketed as a beginner's set from the original FoW Inc. announcement, so it's entirely possible the power level of this product is intentionally designed on the lower side.    I think the product is intended to solicit interest from those who are not ""core"" players already or who are really casual and just want a standalone boxed parlor game like Apples to Apples.  If there was a hot chase card in this product, it would reduce availability for non-core people."
FoWtcg,39ba86,MagicianLord,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:57:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know it is designed as a ""deckbuilders toolkit"" type of product for new players. However, considering the upcoming set is only 55 cards instead of 110. I was hoping engage knights and the new duel decks would help supplement the playables. These cards all seem so stand-alone and with random races that won't be useful for any other set. It really just is a bit underwhelming."
FoWtcg,39ba86,Some1Random,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"I thought the Grimm Epilogue set was 115 cards, or are you referring to another set?  http://fowtcg.com/product/grimm-cluster-4th-set-booster-pack-%E3%80%8Cthe-millennia-of-ages%E3%80%8D/  Your post said the following:   These cards all seem so stand-alone and with random races that won't be useful for any other set.    Although compatible with existing Force of Will cards, it was designed to be standalone. That is why I mentioned that Engage Knights is more like a board game product than a full expansion.  If a customer wanted a small taste of Force of Will mechanics but didn't want to bother buying singles, starters, or boosters, this product is for that customer."
FoWtcg,39ba86,MagicianLord,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"From what I had heard the set is 55 cards each with an alternate art... a quote from the page you linked.   Including Parallel cards, total 115 kinds   55 x 2 = 110 + 5 basic stones.  It is possible that the information we heard a while ago was wrong, but we will see.   As for being stand-alone. They could have made it stand alone while also helping the main cluster. These cards count as part of grimm cluster for tournaments so it would make sense they might help. For example just changing D'Artangan to Muskateer wouldn't have made the set any less ""stand-alone"" but still would have had a tie-back to another card in grimm cluster and help older rulers.  The thing that makes this game much more interesting than others is the rulers and if they don't provide support for older rulers that aren't as powerful and that have specific themes they will never be playable."
FoWtcg,39ba86,Some1Random,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:42:18 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the sentence you quoted does make it sound like it is 55 x2.  Maybe I misread.  The reason I thought it was a 115 card set is that FoW Inc. is still selling this cluster with 36 boosters per box.  It just seems weird to be selling a 36-booster box when there are only 55 unique cards.  I think I can understand where you are coming from in regards to supporting older cards.  Musketeers was only supported in the Grimm cluster.  From my observations of Japanese-designed card games, they tend to support a lot of tribal cards, but only within one set or two.  After that, you either won't ever see them again or see them years later.  In the case of D'Artagnan in Engage Knights, it also looks like they kept to a finite number of resonator types to keep the set simpler for new players.  I have a feeling that ""Musketeer"" is such a very narrow resonator type that we probably won't see any more support for a very, very long time.  What would improve support of older cards is better resonator type definitions.  For example, why is D'Artangan not a Human?  Humans are a broader type and are likely to continue to get support in the future."
FoWtcg,39ba86,MagicianLord,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:12:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. I know we are unlikely to see them revisiting old tribals, I just like a more healthy meta. The current meta reminds me of Fairies in Standard, play the best or GTFO and it bores me a bit. Small things like that make it possible for other decks to be viable or niche playable.   I would like to see them go to the whole race/class system. So every card is a Human / Knight or Elf / Six Sage etc. Instead of just ""Warlord"", but oh well... we will see how things in the future shake out."
FoWtcg,39ba86,Some1Random,2,Thu Jun 11 05:17:02 2015 UTC,"It doesn't take much to break a card, especially ones that trigger when entering the field from anywhere."

FoWtcg,39ba86,Ghostinthecorner,2,Wed Jun 10 18:10:00 2015 UTC,All of the engage knight cards have alternate arts. I'm not sure why they did this but it is my understanding that in each box some have the alternate arts. So like I guess its more reason to buy more boxes of it?
FoWtcg,39ba86,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:13:31 2015 UTC,Lol seems weird.
FoWtcg,39ba86,Ghostinthecorner,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:17:24 2015 UTC,I think it is a win win. The company makes more money because people buy more product looking for the alternate arts and players win because a lot of people are into collecting alternate art things.

FoWtcg,39ba86,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:25:08 2015 UTC,Not sure how that would work since every box has the same set of cards.

FoWtcg,39as99,LoliBacon,3,Wed Jun 10 14:10:35 2015 UTC,"Where this rule would be relevent is if you were to declare combat without any intention of attacking in order to draw out some sort of response from your opponent. If they have something like branch of hourai out and you are baiting them to activate it early to tap your guys so you could cast gilles to swing for game. In the case that they don't respond with anything, you must declare an attacker otherwise you forfeit being able to attack for the rest of the turn."
FoWtcg,39as99,Sqewer,2,Wed Jun 10 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"In the future, there may also be cards that trigger upon entering attack step. This rules clause will prevent you from entering combat and then cancelling repeatedly just trigger the effect."
FoWtcg,39as99,Sqewer,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"But that doesn't work. Since they used an ability and then you forfeited, you could then drop Gilles and then swing. That fits within the rule."
FoWtcg,39as99,Sqewer,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:48:46 2015 UTC,In the case that they don't respond with anything   Read carefully. Thanks!
FoWtcg,39as99,Sqewer,0,Sun Jun 14 14:01:04 2015 UTC,"But then why not just swing with the things you thought they'd tap with Hourai? If it's such an obvious threat to them that you thought they MIGHT consider tapping it, make them realize it actually is a threat. This rule is just to punish bad play."
FoWtcg,39as99,Sqewer,2,Tue Jun 16 08:44:42 2015 UTC,"Because maybe you don't have any good attacks on board, but your opponent doesn't know this. Here's an example:  I initiate combat with only a Loup Garou on the field and 6 mana. My opponent has a Swordsman of the Full Moon and a Branch of Hourai and is at 1300 life.  Scenario 1: He uses the branch. I cast Gilles de Rais and win the game.  Scenario 2: He knows about the Gilles now, so he doesn't activate branch. I forfeit the attack, since I don't have a good attack and pass turn. It was worth a try.  Scenario 3: I bait the branch again. This time I don't forfeit the attack, stone the blocker to death and finish the game with thunder.  Scenario 4: Same deal as 3, except he activates branch. I don't have Gilles so I pass turn.  For scenarios 1 and 2, the correct response is to not activate Branch. For scenarios 3 and 4, the correct response is to activate Branch. You are mind gaming your opponent when you declare combat - Do I have Gilles? Or do I have removal + burn? The forfeiture rule makes a difference here when they guess correctly that you have Gilles and not the removal + burn."
FoWtcg,39as99,MaliciousJoy,0,Wed Jun 17 01:46:48 2015 UTC,"That's.... not a thing. Your opponent has no reason to activate branch with that much mana open and only a single, shitty attacker. There's no mind game there. You're presenting the option of choice, except the choice is so obviously the wrong one that they shouldn't even consider it. That's called false choice and inhibits depth of a scenario. The correct scenario would be: you have a Gilles out and 6 will open. You declare attack step. They don't tap with branch, you attack with Gilles, they block. OR, you attack with Gilles, they tap branch, you cast Gilles. Regardless, Swordsman of the full moon is a flyer, you still don't win regardless of the scenario. Once you drop the second Gilles, they'll just tap both of your Gilles every turn."
FoWtcg,39as99,RamboJezus,2,Fri Jun 19 14:10:34 2015 UTC,I clearly presented a scenario where if they don't tap branch they lose. You won't always have Gilles de Rais in hand and sometimes they do need to account for removal + burn kills.
FoWtcg,39as99,RamboJezus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:18:55 2015 UTC,"If I'm reading it correctly, it's only when they chose to forfeit their attack, not forced to forfeit because they can't."
FoWtcg,39as99,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:17:28 2015 UTC,"According to these responses, the rule is moot? Why would anyone ever choose to forfeit attack until the very end of turn if they have the choice to have that option open?"
FoWtcg,39as99,MaliciousJoy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:21:52 2015 UTC,There is literally no downside to not forfeiting attack.
FoWtcg,39as99,MaliciousJoy,0,Wed Jun 10 14:22:15 2015 UTC,You've got a double negative in there so are you saying there is no downside to attacking? You might be confused about how battle works. You know you can enter and leave battle phase and re-enter multiple times a turn right? It is inside your main phase effectively.
FoWtcg,39as99,MaliciousJoy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:26:49 2015 UTC,No. There's no reason to forfeit attack if you can simply cast new resonators with swiftness and re-enter battle phase. Define what forfeiting an attack means in this game? Does it mean not attacking with a capable resonator?
FoWtcg,39as99,MagicianLord,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:28:12 2015 UTC,The rule isn't moot I just think you're confused as to what the word forfeit means.
FoWtcg,39as99,RamboJezus,0,Wed Jun 10 14:25:40 2015 UTC,That's not it at all.
FoWtcg,39as99,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:27:02 2015 UTC,Then you're confused about something. The rule is valid it just doesn't work how you think it does.
FoWtcg,39as99,RamboJezus,0,Wed Jun 10 14:28:06 2015 UTC,So explain it.
FoWtcg,39as99,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:28:32 2015 UTC,"Forfeiting attack is only when you initiate battle and then decide to not declare any attack, regardless if you have resonators available to attack with."

FoWtcg,39c4kq,Rez_TR,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:03:11 2015 UTC,"Yes it would. And you should also get the bonus from just a single copy. Whether that's actually nutty, or just fun I cannot say."
FoWtcg,39bg2x,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"Just want to bring up some ruling changes that were being discussed in another thread.   Inquisition and Purifying Fire will get considerably weaker when 06-12 rulings come into play. You will have to be careful about using your j-activate on Nameless, because if she dies while a J-Ruler, she becomes a ""Astral Ruler"" and you lose the benefits of those cards."
FoWtcg,39bg2x,Tonitrui,2,Wed Jun 10 20:51:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up but I actually knew that already. In fact I started the thread on it. =D I hope you enjoyed the videos.
FoWtcg,39bg2x,Tonitrui,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:01:19 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, that was you i was arguing with. Ill get a confirmation later from the local judges, but i am assuming the actual working difference matters for cards like xeex's between, ""Ruler"", J-Ruler"", ""J/Ruler"", and ""J/Resonator""  Also, cant watch until i get home, but I will check them out."
FoWtcg,39bg2x,Tonitrui,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:25:04 2015 UTC,I don't recall any argument. J/ruler is short for J-Ruler or Ruler. You no longer have a Ruler or J-Ruler once you have an Astral Ruler. How do you have judges? There is no judge program in place yet as far as i know.
FoWtcg,39bg2x,huntj09,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:38:17 2015 UTC,"But there are people who are part of a private FB group testing our the judge tests for FoW. And the arguement was that the change of name to ""Astral Ruler"" won't effect cards whos effects state ""J/Ruler"". As long as the card type has ""Ruler"" in it, you still get full effects, such as Xeex's. And I did get that confirmed."
FoWtcg,39bg2x,jmillr,0,Thu Jun 11 03:04:03 2015 UTC,Well then I urge you to refer this secret society of FoW judges to page 4 and page 8 of the comprehensive rules ver 5.1. Which will surely make them realize their mistake.
FoWtcg,399fsg,powrdragn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:22:09 2015 UTC,You can only block with one resonator per attack. For now.
FoWtcg,399fsg,Eucser,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:54:22 2015 UTC,Just one.
FoWtcg,399fsg,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:59:25 2015 UTC,There can only be one
FoWtcg,399fsg,Kevinw778,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:30:19 2015 UTC,"Hrm...   That makes combat a little less strategic.  But I guess on the other hand, it puts more emphasis on the additions and enhancement spells."
FoWtcg,399fsg,RamboJezus,0,Wed Jun 10 16:39:24 2015 UTC,I think you're only looking at one aspect of combat. Combat in this game is a lot more complex than in Magic. Also not surd how you came to the conclusion that it puts more emphasis on risking getting 2 for 1ed.
FoWtcg,399fsg,jmillr,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:20:12 2015 UTC,"I came to that conclusion by playing it out.  We played out a few scenarios with double blocking and looked at the options, then did the same attacks with single blocking.  This was done partially to see the differences, but also because we weren't completely sure which was correct.  But more often than not, you've gotta leave will open to spend and be able to pump resonators many times (or play extra cards during combat).  It's not a bad thing per se.  It's just something to keep in mind during deck building and game play.  Now, I wouldn't go so far as to say it's ""more complex than in Magic.""  I haven't really felt that at all yet.  Though I do enjoy this game quite a bit."

FoWtcg,396jy8,ftkaleh,2,Tue Jun 9 16:50:34 2015 UTC,I very much like the 3 color variant over the two color one. A few suggestions for this build would be more light sources over blue sources for more consistent t3 tell a fairy tale. Max out on thunders for sure. Oz is your best 3 drop so ideally you will want 3 or 4 of him. And 1 copy of Kai mainboard helps a ton against the abdul matchup.

FoWtcg,395x8b,Rez_TR,3,Tue Jun 9 19:32:46 2015 UTC,"No, but if you'll notice, cards with ties to a ruler only refer to your j/ruler and not your Astral ruler. Your Astral ruler will no longer satisfy those conditions and will henceforth lose access to those additional effects."

FoWtcg,395x8b,MagicianLord,2,Wed Jun 10 13:12:29 2015 UTC,"Grimm is a Human, so Jeanne d'Arc can destroy Grimm, since her destroy ability does not reference any particular part of the field.  EDIT: This is not possible, because rule 10.9 specifically has requirements on destroyed Rulers."
FoWtcg,395x8b,MagicianLord,2,Wed Jun 10 14:07:11 2015 UTC,"So wait, you can flip her destroy grimm and with these new rules null his can cast any fairy tail ability? Well that's something"
FoWtcg,395x8b,Some1Random,3,Wed Jun 10 15:28:15 2015 UTC,"Yes.  That is how I interpret it.  If Grimm does become the meta Ruler card in light of the Astral Ruler rule change, Jeanne may end up being the anti-meta card to counter it.  EDIT: Jeanne cannot destroy Grimm.  Rule 10.9 specifically mentions when a ruler can be destroyed.   In CR version 5.1, Rule 2.5:   Race or trait itself doesn't have any specified rules, though it is referred by some abilities  and  effects.  If  an  effect  refers  race  or  trait  without  any  zone  it's  in,  it refers cards in a play ground with that race or trait.   For example, this revised ruling allows ""Tinker Bell, the Spirit"" to gain an extra 200/200 if your Ruler/J-Ruler is a Fairy Tale (such as Puss n' Boots).  Your ruler area is part of the play ground.  EDIT #2:  After talking to one of the newly appointed FoW judges, here is what really is happening.   Rule 2.5 is true. Rule 10.9 is also true.   However, Rule 1.4 (the Golden Rules) has a bullet point that says:   If an effect prohibit to do something and the other effect instructs to do that, prohibiting effect precedes.   So, in this case. Jeanne would destroy Grimm, but the rules say that you can't destroy rulers without a ""destroy ruler"" effect. Via Rule 1.4, because rule 2.5 says you can destroy ruler (because of Grimm's race) and 10.9 says you cannot destroy ruler, then 10.9 wins. Rule 2.5 never happens (for purposes of anything trying to trigger from destroy effects.)"
FoWtcg,395x8b,Some1Random,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry about this, but smarter people than I have told me that Jeanne's ability cannot affect Grimm.

FoWtcg,395x8b,Some1Random,2,Sat Jun 13 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"Seemed like a fairly obvious change and a good one, I do think it would be a good idea for them to give examples of these changes so it is more obvious though. It made 0 sense why after your ruler died you still got the benefit from those cards. Jeanne isn't around to buff your purifying fire because she died horrifically."
FoWtcg,395x8b,Some1Random,-1,Tue Jun 9 14:17:22 2015 UTC,This issue I take with this is that it doesn't affect decks unilaterally. In fact it only really affects Jeanne and Puss in boots decks. (With one or two exceptions that don't immediately come to mind). It makes sense from a flavor stand point but not really a gameplay one.
FoWtcg,395x8b,MortuusSet,2,Tue Jun 9 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"Also affects Bahamut, Abdul, Little Red etc etc. Any of those cards are affected and there is a lot of them. It brings the rulers without cards like that slightly closer."
FoWtcg,395x8b,suineg,-3,Tue Jun 9 15:13:34 2015 UTC,It has very little impact on those Rulers. You're just trying to find any excuse to disagree with me. People barely play summoning art of alhazred and Abdul is just absurd in his own right. Dragon king's flame could be a reasonable argument if Bahamut didn't have the ability to become imperishable. Xeex a card that is ubiquitous and its synergy with Little Red is basically just win more.
FoWtcg,395x8b,suineg,3,Tue Jun 9 16:10:18 2015 UTC,"I mean you mentioned 2 rulers that haven't seen play in months and even when they did had marginal success. Bahamut is actually relevant and uses the card, and multiple abdul lists before MPR ran Summoning Art. You picked 2 really random examples when there is a slew of them."
FoWtcg,395x8b,Sqewer,-5,Tue Jun 9 16:57:23 2015 UTC,I picked decks that were genuinely affected by the change. I wasn't looking for the most competitive decks that were marginally affected by the change. As for the decks not having seen play in months i'm not really sure what you mean. The game has only been out since February and has had maybe 2 large tournaments in the US (over 100 people) maybe less i don't know. People play tier 2 decks. Just because Puss in Boots isn't spiking tournaments doesn't mean people don't play him. Yet again not sure why I'm feeding the troll.
FoWtcg,395x8b,suineg,2,Tue Jun 9 17:07:22 2015 UTC,"Even going by your logic though those two decks are some of the least affected. Neither really activates early and in most cases by the time they activate the game is over. Inquisition tends to be used earlier, and is still easily activated with cats/gretels. Purifying fire is barely used in her anyways and the 700 damage is marginal in a control deck. Athos gets slightly worse in Puss, but still is a great card even after.  Bahamut activates early to mid game and you can still come back from him dying without Imperishable. Pandora can die easily and still have a shot, but Spiral will be weaker. Abdul with demon packages were pretty popular before MPR and are definitely hurt which means less interesting builds and more of the same. Yellow brick road certainly didn't need to be hurt more. Lumia is the same as other control rulers."

FoWtcg,395x8b,MagicianLord,-1,Tue Jun 9 19:52:05 2015 UTC,Not really if she died you're probably losing anyway. Its not like xeex suddenly becomes bad either it just becomes less amazing.
FoWtcg,395x8b,Sokios,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:57:57 2015 UTC,So a deck like Yellow Brick Road which is reliant and pumping up weenies with her doubling all the additions etc on the table is losing if you rested for a stone and she was targetted with an ability or other method to kill her?
FoWtcg,395x8b,Sokios,0,Tue Jun 9 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"Considering she most likely got ganked by a dragon or demon, then yes, things are not looking that great for you."

Her dying is not the end of the world, it isn't a game loser and this rule is a big deal for decks with her. Luckily I started with this rule and plan on it.   What would have been a more accurate statement is that Grimm is really the only ruler not in Valhalla that is immune to any of this."

FoWtcg,395x8b,Tonitrui,2,Tue Jun 9 20:32:24 2015 UTC,"Astral Ruler definition has been introduced to describe a J-ruler that is put into a ruler area upon destruction. A destroyed J-ruler gains the type Astral・ loses ATK, DEF and all abilities.   It does not say that they lose the type J-Ruler, do you have a clarification from some where?"
FoWtcg,395x8b,MagicianLord,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:01:19 2015 UTC,"In CR version 5.1 from the PDF link on the official website, not the announcement:  Rule 3.8 - Ruler Area   While a card with J-ruler side up is in ruler area, it loses type ""J-ruler"" and gains type ""astral ruler"". it loses all of its ability and doesn't have ATK and DEF.   So, if you let your J-Ruler get destroyed and your deck has cards that look for J-Ruler, those cards are going to become weaker or lose modes due to this new ruling.  Rule 10.9 says this:   If it's a ruler card in ruler area, it moves to owner's graveyard if the effect says ""destroy ruler"" specifically."
FoWtcg,395x8b,Tonitrui,0,Wed Jun 10 03:09:58 2015 UTC,"This was my understanding of the rules change as well.  At first I thought it was a balance change to effect cards like Stories Told in 1001 Nights or Xeex, but without it saying that it loses J-ruler such cards wouldn't be affected.

FoWtcg,394nm2,DaveStrudle,2,Tue Jun 9 05:58:38 2015 UTC,Familiar of winds activation cost includes sacrificing the creature so once its ability is activated it's no longer on the battlefield for you to kill.
FoWtcg,394nm2,charmanderaznable,2,Tue Jun 9 06:12:47 2015 UTC,You've pretty much got it down. The first spell in is the last spell to resolve. A spell on the stack only resolves when both players have passed priority. (As far as I've seen in force of will you can't hold priority like you can in magic). Banishing the familiar is a part of paying the cost to activate its ability. Paying costs doesn't use the chase.
FoWtcg,394nm2,RamboJezus,2,Tue Jun 9 11:38:13 2015 UTC,"I believe turn player gains priority first in a action sequence. Thus if you are turn player, you can activate a spell or ability, and be the first one to be able to react to it."
FoWtcg,394nm2,Sqewer,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:24:00 2015 UTC,Yeah thats right. I guess in FoW you wouldn't have to declare you're holding priority like in magic. If you don't indicate otherwise it is assumed you pass priority. You just get priority back regardless in FoW. I haven't seen a need for it yet honestly though so I guess thats why I didn't know for 100% certainty.
FoWtcg,394nm2,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:34:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your reply on the other post made me realize that I didn't know everything that I should've when I made the attempt to answer the dudes question.

FoWtcg,394nm2,AjAyIGN,2,Tue Jun 9 16:41:57 2015 UTC,I'm about to open up 3 booster boxes hoping to get some of the cards I want. THE CHASE.
FoWtcg,394nm2,Some1Random,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yup, it is just like a stack in real life or a stack in programming or anything that refers to a stack. If you pile pieces of paper one on top of the other once you start pulling them off the first one you put into the stack is the last one you pull off. It is really intuitive once you get the big picture down.  Also costs are paid when you cast/activate things so in your Familiar of Holy Wind example the cost to activate it is sacrificing, so by the time it gets to the chase and your opponent can do things it is already gone and can't be targetted by stoning."

FoWtcg,392unk,luchadore768,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"Are you looking to become a U.S. distributor?  On the FoW official website, it already lists the official distributors that carry the product.  FoW Inc. doesn't list their management staff, and they don't always answer email inquiries.  You might want to go to the unofficial ""Force of Will - U.S."" Facebook group and ask Matt Kozmor and Robert Herbert for more information.  They have contacts with a few of the official people in FoW Italy and Japan, so they might be able to forward your question over to the people in charge.  Matt and Robert are not official U.S. representatives of the company, but have worked hard to make suggestions for the U.S. market to the official staff."
FoWtcg,392unk,MagicianLord,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:29:33 2015 UTC,Matt and Robert have helped but none of their contacts are responded.  I'm assisting a smaller distributor in making contact with Force of Will and we just want a phone meeting to speak our case.
FoWtcg,392unk,MagicianLord,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:17:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you've already tried that route.  If they aren't able to connect you to them, then it's probably not going to happen.  At this point, you'd need someone in Japan who can reach them directly and be your direct representative."
FoWtcg,390zzu,Nurios,3,Mon Jun 8 13:35:50 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to see what else is in the set.  I'm not initially blown away by the counter mechanics, as I feel that cards with counters tend to be hot targets for removal, but white having recurring removal without a rest action is great.  In the right deck, you could protect your resonators with things like Realm of the Pure Spirits and still pop off opponent resonators.  And Quickcast is always fantastic.  Every additional quick drop, either during an attack or at the end of an opponents turn, is a great boon."
FoWtcg,390zzu,TankErdin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that the counter mechanics synergize with Dream of Juliet--not their ENTER ability, but their continuous ability. You can save one from removal, and generate tokens with one card. Granted that's getting into specifics, but it's still fun to think about."
FoWtcg,390zzu,TankErdin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:25:47 2015 UTC,I really like that idea. DoJ is probably one of my favorite white cards in the game right now. It's so damn versatile.
FoWtcg,390zzu,RamboJezus,0,Mon Jun 8 17:43:18 2015 UTC,ALmerius is maybe playable 4 drop that dies to Thunder without an immediate impact on the board (unless you quickcast when they are attacking with something I guess you get to yell GOTCHA!). Maybe there will be a knowledge counter deck that abuses the light card that gives all your recovered resonators hexproof. I can't remember what it is called though.
FoWtcg,390zzu,Radiant-Paladin,3,Mon Jun 8 15:06:01 2015 UTC,"He mentioned it in his post, Realm of the Pure Spirits.    I'm not initially all that impressed with any of these cards either, but it will be interesting to see how far they go with all this knowledge counter stuff.    Also, on Almerius, if your opponent declares an attack with a resonator, could you not flash her in and use her ability to remove the resonator from the game even if they respond with thunder? Not saying a 4 drop ""remove target attacking resonator from the game"" is amazing, but atleast it would do something before dying and be a 2-for-1 if they use thunder on her."
FoWtcg,390zzu,TankErdin,2,Mon Jun 8 15:14:03 2015 UTC,You can also summon her in before your untap phase if you managed to keep the 4 stones through the opponents turn.  4 will open leaves a lot of potential options that your opponent should be considering when playing spells.
FoWtcg,390zzu,wkim564,2,Mon Jun 8 15:20:39 2015 UTC,No. Thunder chases enter ability. Almerius dies before counters land
FoWtcg,390zzu,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:16:35 2015 UTC,Finally someone gets it!
FoWtcg,390zzu,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:26:54 2015 UTC,So it might not be applicable to this game but holding up 4 mana waiting for your opponent to attack you with a creature worth spending 4 mana on to kill seems like the easiest thing in this game to play around. Mystic Snake isn't exactly a constructed MTG allstar. She seems extra bad against Abdul.
FoWtcg,390zzu,TankErdin,2,Mon Jun 8 15:15:49 2015 UTC,you could protect your resonators with things like Realm of the Pure Spirits

FoWtcg,390zzu,RamboJezus,2,Mon Jun 8 15:11:56 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how I feel about any of these. Duet is the only one that I kinda like.

FoWtcg,3937m5,JimWolfie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:36:59 2015 UTC,"In regards to Kaguya A 300/300 for 1 is not a good deal. It is in fact the definition of average. You have to give a generic 300/300 haste in order for it to see play. Make no mistake Kaguyas abilities aren't relevant for a good amount of time. If you see her early she is more or less a bad hunter in black forest. From the spoilers we have now you more or less have to have a strong board presence for her to plop down and be relevant on board.  I think if she ever attacks or activates her ability (add a counter) your opponent is going to punch her in the face and be done with it.  Next, Almerius is a trap. Holding up 4 mana and passing the turn is telegraphing what you have in your hand. This card has blowout potential, but only if your opponent allows it. Yet we don't know how all the sages are going to interact with each other and how good the knowledge counters are actually going to be.  It is also worth noting that she is very bad against Abdul.  Zero seems to be playable. Her rate is fine and quickcast just like on Almerius is better than not having it but, I ask myself why not just play fiethsing?    Duet of Truth is something that wasn't mentioned in this article that is by far the most exciting card spoiled. This card is just gas. When a white weenie style archetype pops up (it already kind of has with the R/W grimmia) this is going to help them a good bit. Anyway I was a little underwhelmed by the spoilers and evaluating these cards for what they are is about all we can do now. When the rest of the set is spoiled we will have a much more clear indication if the knowledge counter decks are worth it."
FoWtcg,3914my,Chireth,2,Mon Jun 8 14:13:17 2015 UTC,"If the FoW starter decks you bought are from ""The Dawn of Valhalla,"" you're unlikely to be able to use them for tournament play.  The reason is that the starter decks were created from an expansion that was not released in North America, and it appears the company will not be releasing it here.  Also, the starter deck rules are obsolete now.  Officially, there is an eternal format called Origin (with two variants) that would allow you to use the starter deck cards.  But most stores have chosen to play Grimm Cluster (block), which only allows cards that were released during the period of Crimson Moon's Fairy Tale, The Tower of Heavens and Two Towers, and The Moon Princess Returns.  The starter decks are not valid for use in the Grimm Cluster format.  As for starting your collection, in July, a standalone fixed (non-random) box set called ""Vingolf - Engage Knights"" will be released.  It contains several useful staple cards and dual stones and one Ruler per attribute (color).  The box set is legal for play in the current Grimm format and regionals.    In addition, a new starter deck based on the next cluster will be released in July (sort of like MTG's Duel Decks).  It contains two Ruler cards.  It will also be legal to play in the current Grimm format and regionals.  You may still want to pick up at least one box of each of the first three expansions to build up a collection of commons and uncommons.  After that, depending on your personal preferences, you may want to buy specific cards individually."
FoWtcg,3914my,MagicianLord,2,Mon Jun 8 14:50:21 2015 UTC,"All this, except buying the first 3 sets. They can be relatively expensive at this point(and print amount), it may be better to focus on buying the Vingulf set(2 of them, to get a playset of all the cards, including dual color magic stones), and the next box. Then buying singles for decks.   Of course this is all based on budget."
FoWtcg,3914my,Tonitrui,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:01:38 2015 UTC,I can pick up the first three expansion boxes for 90 each from my local card shop which doesn't seem too bad. I was looking at 3 different decks and the total cost was going to be over 400 bucks which hurts more
FoWtcg,3914my,Tonitrui,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:13:03 2015 UTC,"but when you buy those 3 decks, you actually have 3 decks to play. When you buy 3 boxes, your still putting down 270 on cards, and your getting a lot of common cards, sure. But you will still need several cards for the decks. If you focus on 1 deck now, it would be cheaper than all 3 options, outside of a few choices."
FoWtcg,3914my,MagicianLord,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"$90 per box is a decent price.  I've seen prices go for higher as the supply begins to dwindle.  I have heard conflicting reports that FoW Inc. has stopped printing the first three sets versus supply is available but dwindling, so you should make a decision on buying boxes soon.  Tonitrui is correct in that if you spend $400 on 3 decks, you have those 3 decks now and forever.  If you buy one of each box, you're not likely to get all the cards you want for even a single deck.  The downside is that you can't easily switch to another deck, because you don't have the extra cards.  Having said that, FoW boxes do provide a lot better ratio of ""good pulls"" compared to other card games (FoW's set size is extremely small, which is a good thing I think).  I only suggested buying one box of each set to get some cards into your collection.  You could buy singles from there to fill out whatever you missed.    If you are patient, you could bid on some singles on eBay auctions and try to come away with bargains. I bought some boxes initially, and then got some bargains on eBay.  Good luck!"
FoWtcg,3914my,VulcanXI,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:24:17 2015 UTC,Thank you both for your insight. I did pick up a TAT Booster box and bought one deck. My daughter wants to play were rabbits. That looks like a pretty low cost deck. I did manage to pull 3 Cheshire Cats thanks to the God pack out of the box
FoWtcg,3914my,MagicianLord,2,Tue Jun 9 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"Would definitely like to echo this. If you are getting into FoW, Engage Knights is a great fixed set to pick up since it contains many of the cards that have become a staple.   Great write-up MagicianLord."

FoWtcg,3902jq,Myrrodin,2,Mon Jun 8 07:07:16 2015 UTC,"As much as people want sinbad to work, i haven't seen him used effectively yet, similarly it means your green base feels very poor.  The amount of counterspells you have feels like overkill as well, your deck is far to reactive, which is bad when you can't put any pressure on your opponent in the first place. This is pretty much why most control decks are B/W/G, because unfortunately white and green lack monstorous drops that threaten your opponent.  Now, if you want to continue to play this as just a green/white deck, i would probably suggest either building more around little prince (who can become quite big, albeit vulnerable to his support being removed or just abdul) or also gardea- which regardless of any effects is still a 800/800 for 3. And if you do, you can run djinn of the lamp to give you a 4 drop to boost prince. (If your wondering what the purpose of djinn is, you can swing with everything you have, then drop it to essentially unrest them for your opponents turn) if not djinn, you should try some of the white additions to create threats (longinus/ragnarok)  Also, you run no dream of juliet(one of the best white spells)- which can be played after an addition is played if you weren't able to exceed it when it was. Played. Or also to reset an attacker you used to block. And one last thing, you run 11 stones, which can be cut down to 10 for more consistancy."
FoWtcg,3902jq,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:36:28 2015 UTC,"So if I were to go Black, what would you suggest in the deck? I probably assuming Stoning to Death would be one card, but I'm otherwise not too familiar with the other black cards. As for the Dream of Juliet, I was considering the card, but before I posted, I wasn't sure what to replace for the Dream of Juliets.   Thank you for the quick response."
FoWtcg,3902jq,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:14:13 2015 UTC,"Well if you do add black you could just start looking up standard scheherazade lists, but basically the really good black cards are stoning to death as you said, carmilla(4 drop resonator that also destroys a resonator as an enter effect), mephistopholes(not for every deck though), and necronomicon (broken card for control since it basically lets you play every card in your deck twice)"
FoWtcg,3902jq,xSuperZer0x,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:32:44 2015 UTC,"Sinbad is actually decent, especially with Flying Carpet and Wind Dagger becoming mini Thunder's. You should really try Heartless Scarecrow as a finisher and use 4 Wind Dagger, 2-3 Crucifix, 2-3 Flying Carpet."
FoWtcg,3902jq,RamboJezus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:42:38 2015 UTC,It's rough when you get 2 for 1ed though. That's why Sinbad isn't ubiquitous.
FoWtcg,3902jq,xSuperZer0x,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:20:47 2015 UTC,How do you get two for one'd outside of a creature getting killed in response to an addition being cast on it?

FoWtcg,3902jq,JimWolfie,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"Like sinbad looks great on paper but he just falls short in practice. I think if he had quickcast himself he'd be very playable since it would allow you to drop him while the opponent is tapped out, and then play additions to follow him up. You can even leave the untapped mana to silence or xeex in the early game to get ahead.   Also Heartless Scarecrow is aids without a critical mass of ways to make him stupid. that suite of additions you have there is kinda low  and he probably syngergizes more with the other achievement counter things. If any of the additions had flash themselves they'd be much more playable. And no just because sinbad gives them flash doesn't mean they become more playble. It just means you need more mana to make the strategy work, and then you get outclassed by late game threats because all of your cards are small."
FoWtcg,3902jq,xSuperZer0x,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:05:48 2015 UTC,"He's actually quite good, those were just green additions. Blue gives you Witches Dagger, White gives you Sillver Stake, Longinus. 10 Additions should be plenty that's 1/4th of your deck."
FoWtcg,3902jq,werdunloaded,2,Mon Jun 8 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"You'll need Gretels and more Priests to increase your stone ramp/production. Scheherazade control is only good if you have the mana to back up your Xeex/Cake Zones. As for your negates, you have way too many. Drop the Exceed. Add some Fiethsings for the increased mana production and damage buffer. You can side the Exceed if you want (not much more than 2, though), but it's far too expensive to play willy nilly, especially at 4 and without Gretels/4x Elvish Priest/Fiethsing.  But you're right, neither Green nor White have any big finishers. No Gilles de Rais, Blazer, Mephistopheles, etc. It's not a very ideal color combination right now. You might enjoy some of the Six Sages support coming out next set which has a lot of resonator removal and would make up for the lack of brute force in white."

FoWtcg,38yrsw,suineg,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:09:39 2015 UTC,"there are going to be 2 clusters in a format, the earlier cluster gets rotated out when the 3rd cluster comes in.

EDIT: If you are looking into getting into the game at the lowest price point, I would wait until July. At the end of the month, we get a mega set thing, that will include 2 copies of many staples. I have seen pre orders at around $40. 2 boxs of that will have you set to start in the game immediately."
FoWtcg,38yrsw,Tonitrui,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:34:04 2015 UTC,Sweet! I'll keep an eye out. Things haven't picked up here in Canada like it has in the states with distribution so hopefully I can find those deckbuilders kits.
FoWtcg,38yrsw,noricon,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:11:54 2015 UTC,Look up Vingolf - Engage Knights for more info on the deckbuilders toolkit. The set is being spoiled slowly so you can keep tabs on it. Seems like the toolkit is definitely more useful than the m15 toolkit for magic was.
FoWtcg,38yrsw,MagicianLord,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:17:34 2015 UTC,"In this game, each block is called a cluster.  By July, one cluster will have been released.  When the next cluster is released, there will be a ""New Frontiers"" format which will be the latest 2 clusters (and any side products released during that period that the company says is valid).  Because that second cluster isn't released yet, most stores play Grimm cluster only, which allows only cards from the first cluster.  The U.S. and Canada have the Grimm cluster currently.  For eternal formats, there are Origin: Valhalla and Origin: Bifrost.  The Valhalla cluster was not released in North America, although the original 5 starter decks came from it.  ""Vingolf - Engage Knights"" is a special standalone fixed set coming around July 24.  It's meant for standalone play, so there are no booster packs.  However, the cards in that box are legal for Grimm Cluster play, and they reportedly have staples from the Grimm cluster including ""dual lands."""
FoWtcg,38yrsw,hensomm,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:22:15 2015 UTC,"Yes there are sets.  Buy the Engage Knight box, it is a great way to get started as it has the stones ""lands"" and some very good spells and rulers you will need to start playing."

Multiple grimms in the main ( I'm assuming this isn't a meta call because you're sayingyou'renew).http://www.reddit.com/r/FoWtcg/comments/372n1v/2015_japan_spring_open_decklists/ Check out 5th and 8th.

Is Gile still good enough even if I just splash red deck for Gile. Can see the dislike for multiple Grimm in main, can bring him down to 1x. Is March of Saints bad without lots of 1 drops? I just saw it as a way to alpha strike late in game for the win. Is light/fire Grimmia just the stronger build? I went with light/dark because I liked a lot of the synergies"
FoWtcg,38w19y,RamboJezus,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:04:46 2015 UTC,"I play this style of deck a lot. The R/W is probably just better than B/W, however I think that R/W and B/W/G are at least on par with each other. They are just simply different playstyles of decks and both have proven to be effective. I personally think if you're playing Jeanne Gilles is totally worth playing perhaps even without any red stones."
FoWtcg,38w19y,RamboJezus,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:45:42 2015 UTC,"I can now see the strength of playing fire/white grimmia. Is the B/W/G build just a midrange control deck? Get all the mana ramp and counter cards from green, the kill cards from from black and big demon. White is life gain and for grimmia itself with Ragnarok. In magic I stay away from blue because I don't like playing the long control game. Does this deck play similar? Or is it more of s jund style of deck. I like jund. Hope someone understands what I am referring to."
FoWtcg,38w19y,RamboJezus,0,Sun Jun 7 21:04:40 2015 UTC,People may disagree with me but I'm of the opinion that the B/W/G list plays like UWr Control/Midrange from Modern. The R/W list is hard  create a magic analog for. It is similar to Zoo but still a bit different.
FoWtcg,38w19y,Nyte_Crawler,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:22:59 2015 UTC,"I can see what you mean by comparing the b/w/g green deck to UWr from modern. And that is how I see it as well. I am not a blue Mage in magic, I am a green mage. So feels wierd wanting to play green in FoW; but with all the control aspects wind has, doesn't look appealing. Will test out this W/B/R grimmia deck, but might just have to take out black and just play the better version R/W grimmia"
FoWtcg,38trrw,Taboggan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:20:47 2015 UTC,"Are they getting rid of the ""ENTER"" ability? It said that none of the Vingolf cards will have ""ENTER"" and will instead have the much more powerful ""when this card enters your field"" wording.  I'm wondering if this is a replacement of that keyword or just specific cards will have the new wording."
FoWtcg,38trrw,RecurringAwesome,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:04:44 2015 UTC,Yeah the article says that they aren't going to have the Enter ability in Vingolf. It might be a simple explanation in that Enter isn't really intuitive in that it only triggers when you cast it from your hand and not when it enters the field and that the designers don't want to confuse the new players. I personally hate how Enter is worded and think its one of the worst parts of this game. (The game is still amazing though)
FoWtcg,38trrw,RamboJezus,2,Sat Jun 6 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"You're correct that it isn't intuitive, but I feel like replacing Enter with effects that trigger off Necro is pretty silly. Either A: give new cards ""when this card is played from hand"" effects to match how Enter used to work but with clearer wording or B: make Enter effects work the same as ""when this card Enters your field"" because they should have in the first place"
FoWtcg,38trrw,angstrom401,2,Sat Jun 6 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"This was my point exactly. If they are just making this the new wording for enter abilities then they should have just changed the wording on ""Enter"" in the comprehensive rules."
FoWtcg,38trrw,RecurringAwesome,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:30:33 2015 UTC,This will be the new wording going forward on cards for the most part. They kept the old ability in tact to not be confusing and to allow it's use in the future for cards that must be played from hand.
FoWtcg,38trrw,Some1Random,2,Sun Jun 7 00:59:14 2015 UTC,"Do you have a source saying that this is going to be the new  standard?  I feel like them creating this new wording is a very bad call for the game.   Firstly, this will make the cards currently printed with ""ENTER"" inherently much weaker than they arguably should be. I don't think that any cards would become incredibly broken with the rules change and in fact would make some currently very weak deck strategies into potentially viable ones breathing more life into the newly developing meta.  I don't think it wouldn't be confusing for new players at all. Enter is a perfect keyword for entering play and many new players would assume that it is triggered any time the card enters unless they went out of their way to look at the wording.   The game is still in it's infancy and fixing issues is part of the process. Remember Life Break?  I also feel this will also cause the game to lose a lot of it's style. One of the things that sets Force of Will apart from other card games is it's Symbol Skill and Keyword Skill styling. Printing out the rules text in this new way makes the game look and feel even more like Magic the Gathering rather than defining itself.  I feel that they should change the comprehensive rules text for ""ENTER"" to the new wording and continue printing new cards with the current ""ENTER"" icon.  TL;DR: I think the ""ENTER"" icons look good and help the game stand out and I also feel that cards printed with the old ""ENTER"" ability will be out classed very quickly.  EDIT: Fixed some phrasing."

Alternate Reality Games is running a ARG Circuit tournament, which isn't technically part of the official organized play, but it provides players several venues to compete for prizes.  However, some key people in the U.S. were able to convince FoW Inc. to allow the U.S. to participate in the 2015 World Championship.  Here is the key announcement: http://fowtcg.com/event/force-of-will-world-championship-2015/  Unfortunately, it's only in a few states, but according to the people who worked on this initiative, the U.S. wasn't slated to participate in the FoW World Championships this year originally, so this was a last-minute thing to get some venues in the U.S."

FoWtcg,38rv0k,huntj09,2,Sat Jun 6 07:21:29 2015 UTC,"""New Frontiers"" is the format for all cards released in the last two clusters (blocks).  This is usually a two-year period.  So far, only the Grimm Cluster is released, so this format will officially exist when the Alice Cluster starts.  Currently, the format of most stores is Grimm block.  Since you are in Australia, I understand that the Valhalla cluster was released there.  If that is true, you would have access to Origin: Valhalla and Origin: Bifrost formats, which are eternal formats.  All TCGs are designed as upgrade treadmills.  Most TCG's ""standard"" format is about two years.  If a two-year period is too fast (which for me it is), then wait until Origin formats are announced at your local stores."
FoWtcg,38rv0k,MagicianLord,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:04:57 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll make a second deck and it should last me another 6-12 months at least which is good. As a uni student every purchase has to be viable so if it's going to last me a year then I'm down with that.
FoWtcg,38rv0k,MaliciousJoy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:33:39 2015 UTC,The standard will consist of 2 clusters. So once the first set of the cluster after the Alice cluster releases the Grimm cluster will rotate out. This will probably be about a year and a half from now but we'll have to see how the release schedule of sets go.
FoWtcg,38rv0k,jigoku81,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:22:46 2015 UTC,So the rotation will be quite slow? The one reason I gave up tcgs was because of the consistent need to buy cards all the time. I'm hoping fow will be better on that front.

There is no limit to the number of times a creature can attack in a turn unless specified. Yes you can only block a creature with a single creature. There are no double blocks.

No queen's butler in the main or side. 3 Thunder?!?!    robust amount of resilient threats   you have 4 guys that don't die to flames of the outer world  I do hope it works well for you though, I like Grimmia and play a highly aggressive Fire/Light version that I enjoy playing but haven't had a ton of success with it at my locals (dominated by burn and Scheherazade control)"
FoWtcg,38lrv3,theNightblade,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:00:51 2015 UTC,"I'll try my best to quell your concerns. 1. I'm not sure why you think you need to have 'I' The Pilot in your deck to run little prince. Truthfully it is the other way around. There is no reason to play I if you're not running TLP. I did play with I the pilot and just made the realization that every time I had it in hand or played it I wished it was Alice instead. 2. Burn decks haven't really given me any trouble with the way games play out. Our earlier creatures matchup well against theirs. Our Mid Game creatures are too big and too resilient to burn. Jeanne and Breath of The God and Alice make sure of that. All of my testing has proven this matchup to at the very least be above 50%.  Typically at the point where Split becomes any sort of issue we're either about to close out the game or have already lost. 3. Queen's Butler is something that I simply haven't needed. the 2 Divine Spirits in the main were Queen's Butler but utlimately they were replaced. 4. Not sure what the issue is with having 3 thunder as opposed to 4. You can shave a duel or a breath of the god and replace it with a thunder if you like. If you look closely there are a lot more than 4 'guys' that don't die to flames. Jeanne D'arc makes it so they have to damage a human or fantasy before they can Flames anything. Aside from that Gilles, Mind Reading Fox, and Grimmia are either too big or outright immune to Flames."
FoWtcg,38lrv3,theNightblade,0,Fri Jun 5 14:44:38 2015 UTC,"If any deck has you in a spot where you're casting prince to get 1000 life, you probably have enough to cast I with awakening and go get a prince.  I would never play prince without pilot as it's just too good to get2 guys for 5 mana, potentially 1000 life, and tap an opposing resonator. You must not be playing against good burn decks. More protection for Grimmia is never a bad thing.  Plus, if you get butler out against a deck light on removal (say, mono green elves) you're just going to wreck them. Because thunder is good enough to always play in 4.     Just my opinions.  I play in a highly competitive local and in 3 color builds of grimmia have experienced all of these problems, and found ways to deal with them."
FoWtcg,38lrv3,theNightblade,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"My meta is also highly competitive.    TLP is a beatstick. Gaining 1k life with him is secondary. Swinging 1k on t3 is amazing.  I am.   I agree, however it is a meta call. If I need to play Queen's butler, I will. As of right now I do not. If you need to play him do so. There is nothing wrong with that.   I don't disagree. If you want the 4th thunder then do so. I've preferred using 3. The R/W Grimmia list that top 8'ed the Japan open also only ran 3 thunders. Not saying that is correct it is however not nearly as black and white as you seem to think."

FoWtcg,38lrv3,Some1Random,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:05:04 2015 UTC,I like it! Grimmia seems like a lot of fun and this looks like a good shell.  My questions:  1. Why is Split in the deck at all? Wouldn't it just kill you?  2. Have you considered adding Whispers of the Abyss? A turn 2 Grimmia is terrifying.
FoWtcg,38lrv3,JimWolfie,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:37:09 2015 UTC,Split is in the deck to do damage to us and to our opponents. You can OTK people with Grimmia if you split and flip and swiftness + Ragnarok.

FoWtcg,38hplj,RamboJezus,-2,Fri Jun 5 06:08:48 2015 UTC,"The odd aggro primer has a few errors. The big one being ""Glinda is the only even card"". The deck has 2 Gillles de Rais In the sideboard along with 4 Split heaven and earth and 3 more Glindas. Competitive players use all the pieces of the buffalo. Deck have 65 cards and not just 50."
FoWtcg,38hplj,BamSlam117,2,Thu Jun 4 09:28:26 2015 UTC,I wouldn't really call that an error. I was just referring to the main deck when I was talking about the odd number grimm in my article. I thought it was pretty obvious that when you sideboard in the split/gilles/glinda package you take out the dreams of wonderland and the march hares. I probably should of pointed that out though..
FoWtcg,38hplj,RamboJezus,-6,Thu Jun 4 18:57:08 2015 UTC,"We'll just call it an oversight I guess or perhaps you had a deadline, or perhaps you just wanted to keep it short and sweet. I don't know =P. I   understand how sideboards can be perceived as simply being meta dependent and to a good extent this is true, however when you have a transformative sideboard like the Odd Aggro list that took first at the spring open had it is definitely worth a few mentions, because that is a proactive sideboard choice. He is choosing to jam more fatties and take a more midrange approach postboard. Which is significantly different than a sideboard designed to be reactive which is for some reason seems to be the general attitude towards sideboards at the moment (I don't know why). Anyway a proactively built sideboard is less of a meta consideration than a reactive sideboard and it is definitely worthy of note to point out these things. TCGs are always games of percentages and knowing something that your opponent doesn't know is always valuable. Understanding sideboards seems to be a greatly overlooked skill with less competitive players and I want to change that mentality before this game really takes off. I think it will increase the strength of all players in the community."
FoWtcg,38hplj,CryptWolf,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:05:57 2015 UTC,"Right now we aren't really writing too much on side boards (or at least we weren't. ) When the first couple of articles were written the American meta hadn't begun to take shape. This meant that sideboards were going to vary a lot, based on local metas."
FoWtcg,38hplj,RamboJezus,-5,Thu Jun 4 14:06:54 2015 UTC,Well if you're interested in someone who will discuss a deck in its entirety...
FoWtcg,38hplj,Teknoghost,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:05:15 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate you reading the article! Let me clarify that the point of the article was not to discuss each deck in depth, but just to give a brief summary of the current tournament scene. I do plan on doing more articles where i focus on one specific deck and its matchups/sideboard plans in the near future though. So keep an eye out for those if that's the kind of content you're looking for."
FoWtcg,38hplj,RamboJezus,-5,Thu Jun 4 19:10:43 2015 UTC,I find it interesting that this site is already censoring comments made on articles. Why? I wrote a rather lengthy response to the Bahamut burn article where the author claims to have made the deck but it is pretty clear he just swapped out a few cards from the 2015 spring open list. My comment was either removed or for some reason was flagged as spam or something akin to that.

FoWtcg,38hplj,Huzzmann,-7,Thu Jun 4 22:50:15 2015 UTC,That is just uncalled for. I don't have autism or any other disorder of that nature. If you compare the article and the Spring 2015 list he more or less copied it and is trying to take credit for creating the deck. This is just not okay. You don't steal credit from someone else like that.
FoWtcg,38hplj,RamboJezus,2,Thu Jun 4 22:52:28 2015 UTC,"Dude it's a burn deck, not rocket science. Almost at least half the parts will be the same, sometimes even 3/4ths of the deck will be completely the same."

FoWtcg,38jdmr,Fotonurth,2,Fri Jun 5 10:08:11 2015 UTC,"If your looking to purchase full decks you may be able to pick some up off Ebay. Don't buy the structure decks that are currently out. They are not legal in the current format. The newest set that drops on the 24th will have most of the staples you need to be competitive. My advice would be to wait until then and get all the staples, magic stones and rulers. As far as meta goes, it depends on your locals. Right now the game is relatively new. Top decks in my opinion are Grimm (odd and control) and Abdul Control."
FoWtcg,38jdmr,OMGITZRP,2,Thu Jun 4 17:01:39 2015 UTC,What are your playstsyles and how competitive are you looking to be? I have a budget thread on here that has some good cheap options that build up into competitive decks.

Its used in competitive oddgro grimm and its actually done REALLY well e.g. 1st place japan open and 2nd in caturday. But surprisingly, its still stuck around 8. Now im not saying deep wood shouldnt be 18, thats another discussion entirely but it just doesnt make sense for only THAT stone to go up solely on the reasoning that it's proven. Im super curious too. My silly theory is someone just threw it in ebay or on a store for 20 and some people saw it and started pricing it at 20 then more saw it and so forth. And since people ae willing to buy it at 20, no one has bothered to change it."

FoWtcg,38hbsv,Eucser,2,Thu Jun 4 05:28:27 2015 UTC,"On the other hand you if you run Scheherazade, you can bluff set a dead Cake Zone (or other card) if it's the only card in your hand. So that turn or next turn you can Tap > Draw 2. I have done this a few times in practice against more aggressive decks (until I can side out dead cards)."
FoWtcg,38hbsv,werdunloaded,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"The only idea that I have right now is to use effects that count your hand size as 0. It is a bluff, but not one most people would expect."

FoWtcg,38h6k8,IIDecayII,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:34:42 2015 UTC,i dont think the stones count as your rare for a pack. But the ratio for super rares is really good.
FoWtcg,38h6k8,Tonitrui,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:56:49 2015 UTC,"Stones don't count for the rares I don't think but the ration for SR's are spectacular, like Tonitrui said. The thing is that every booster comes with one R card with chances of a SR and a chance for a stone. Stones aren't always in the boosters but you can get them. In my experience I get a stone in 1 of 3 boosters mostly basic stones. The chance for a Special stone or True Stone is actually pretty high. Rulers are harder to get because there are a certain number of rulers in each set (i.e. MPR {Moon priestess returns} TAT {Two Towers} and CMF {Crimson Moon} ) However there are 'Common' Rares as well. Take Vampire's Staff for example. I pulled 6 in a row, that's an example of a Common Rare. You got really good pulls from those boosters that you bought. Etna is such a great card as well as Camilla, Swordsman, Alucard and Cottage. The dividends for FoW cards are great as well weather you're looking for trading/selling/collecting. I know I went on a tangent here but I was looking to maybe answer any backed up questions you had or going to have. If you have any more questions, just message me and I'll get back to you as soon as I can."
FoWtcg,38h6k8,DaveStrudle,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:53:35 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking:   A super rare card will replace a common card in a booster. A rare magic stone card will replace the common stone in a booster. A CMF booster box will have on average 3-4 Ruler cards. A TAT booster box will have on average 2 Ruler cards.   There is high variance in the way the cards are collated into boosters.  It's possible to get multiple copies of a rare or super rare in a booster box.  I read one person's Facebook post that he obtained zero Ruler cards in his TAT booster box.  Since I don't know FoW's printing process, it's hard to say if they have a ""common rare"" sheet and a ""rare rare"" sheet.  I think it's just very random the way they box things at the printer and not because they have different rare sheets."
FoWtcg,38h6k8,MagicianLord,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:27:39 2015 UTC,"The ratios are 13 super rares per box. 7 rare stones from CMF and TAT and 5 rare stones from MPR. The only thing that changes these ratios are ""god"" packs which are packs that replace every card in the pack with rare stones or one of each super rare in the set."

Zapdos got a decent amount of the meta correct but left out the 2nd best deck in the game which is Grimmia Midrange. The best deck more or less being Grimm Aggro whether it be the odd variety or otherwise.

FoWtcg,38807q,r3ttah3ht,2,Tue Jun 2 14:38:49 2015 UTC,Quickcast reads (You may play this card anytime you can play a Spell:Chant-Instant.) So you can cast it anytime you could cast a Spell:Chant-Instant. I think you're misreading it.
FoWtcg,38807q,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:41:04 2015 UTC,"thank you, yeah probably was overthinking it. so essentially it like a instant chant. which is pretty good."
FoWtcg,38807q,Theoduin,2,Tue Jun 2 15:02:51 2015 UTC,"Quick cast just means that you can cast it at the same speed as a Spell: Chant Instant. It has instant cast speed. You'd be able to Thunder on their turn because is has Chant Instant speed just as you'd be able to use Windrider Merchant on their turn because it has the same speed as Chant Instant spells. Casting a chant instant isn't exactly a cost, it's just giving you can example of when you'd be able to cast it."
FoWtcg,388yl2,Sailor_Vulcan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:59:26 2015 UTC,Like the standard 2/3 color midrange decks are around $150-200 and rising. Luckily for new players in July they are releasing a deckbuilders toolkit that is resplendent and littered with constructed staples. Pretty much 2 of each of the expensive ones including 2 of each dual stone. So the cost should go down a lot at least for a little while during July when that is released.
FoWtcg,388yl2,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:24:56 2015 UTC,It's the deckbuilder's toolkit that is useful for building competitive decks. To me it just seems like a better one than Magic's DBTK.

FoWtcg,388yl2,MagicianLord,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:30:54 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what level you want to invest and play at. I have sold plenty of decks to people for the $30-$60 range, but obviously they will struggle against perfectly tuned odd grimm or 3 color Abdul. If you are looking to just dip your toes in and see if you like the game I would avoid staples outside of dual stones and just try a couple cheap decks first."
FoWtcg,388yl2,Some1Random,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:41:02 2015 UTC,I was able to put together a decent tournament ready deck for about $60. It had a hard time against the fully tweaked decks. But still put up a good fight. My recommendation is to aim for one of the top decks and see if you can sub out a few cards until you are ready to invest a little more.
FoWtcg,388ihg,SeriouslyGaming,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:34:25 2015 UTC,Definitely suggest cutting Sleeping Beauty and Longinus. You will definitely lose games because you flip those on Dreams or March Hare and they aren't good enough to warrant the risk. The only thing that might be is Glinda and I still disagree with that.  If you want an addition I would suggest Silver Stake or Hamelin's Pipe since they both are odd and can move around if need be.  Other suggestion would be to cut down to 2 colors. Right now you can't really go to more than 4 stones against anything with fire in it and that can make it difficult.
FoWtcg,388ihg,Some1Random,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:43:41 2015 UTC,The even cards don't add anything to the deck. They only make it less consistent. I would also suggest fixing your colors because you have an entire stone deck of non basics which is just bad when you have no way to beat Split Heaven and Earth.
FoWtcg,388ihg,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:10:24 2015 UTC,"Ya, I can see how split heaven and earth would be a problem. Which color would you drop?"

FoWtcg,388ihg,Some1Random,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:37:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah before MPR the odd deck was full American with multiple true stones, but now with Split around you should use the advantage of Grimm in not needing so many special stones."
FoWtcg,388ihg,Mr_canman87,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can confirm that that particular list is the nut.  I have a card or two that I've changed around since I started playing that list (in the board: -1 Split, -1 Duel of Truth, +1 Rapid Decay, +1 The Emperor with New Clothes), but nothing drastic.  In my local meta, Split has not been crushing skulls like it may have upon its initial release, so I felt like dropping one for a better utility resonator (Emperor) that I have the ability to tutor for was much better.  So far in my shop's events I am undefeated with this list.  Definitely a spot I would recommend starting if you are looking for a powerful aggressive deck."
FoWtcg,388ihg,Some1Random,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:43:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly it is up to you, it changes the tone of the deck. Water/Fire tends to be more aggressive and your higher end becomes Blazer. This tends to be the more favored build for Odd.  While Light/Fire tends to be more mid-range with Tell a Fairy Tell into Piper being your high end. Because you don't have Dreams in these colors you can add a few even cards if you like instead of march hare, and you have Dreams for the blocker removal instead of bounce.  I can't really see removing fire."
FoWtcg,388ihg,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:05:58 2015 UTC,O.o? Did you really just say a card that a deck with the real high end is at 3 with Tell a fairy tale and (fetch Piper + Gilles de rais is a 2 of at 5cmc which isn't much top end) is more midrangey than a deck that tops out with 4 Blazer 3 Etnas and 2 Gilles de Rais? Are you insane? The Light/Fire Grimm Aggro is WAY MORE aggro oriented than the Blue/Red one.
FoWtcg,388ihg,Some1Random,0,Wed Jun 3 15:21:33 2015 UTC,"No matter the Grimm build you can play for whichever phase of the game you want, it is one of the reasons he sees so much play. Some matches you need a more grindy gameplan and can tutor appropriately, some games you want a faster opener etc.   That being said... It is all in how the deck tends to run Water/Fire tends to run 4 more 1 drops and the only thing that is more than 3 is Etna and Blazer. Gilles isn't in odd builds... and the main plan is to flood the board early and finish off with Blazer + Thunders.  On the other hand Light/Fire has the potential for similar openings, but tends to win with slower strategies like Piper and Gilles which are far slower...  I have been playing Grimm since I started in this game and have brewed lists 2-3 cards off every build that has made top 8 recently before they were public. I know a thing or two about Grimm..."
FoWtcg,388ihg,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:58:24 2015 UTC,Then you would know that the deck that took first at the 2015 open ran 2 Gilles De Rais. I guess what the decks actually run aren't important because you know a thing or two about Grimm and I clearly have absolutely no idea what i'm talking about. The lists that run Tell a Fairy Tale rarely just hardcast Hamelin willy nilly. The goal is to ideally cheat him into play. It is clear we have a difference in opinion here. You seem to think that having more top end creatures makes a deck more aggressive and I tend to disagree.
FoWtcg,388ihg,Some1Random,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:19:53 2015 UTC,He ran 2 in the board... nobody is running around with multiple Gilles Main in an odd build unless they be crazy.  The point is the goal and average play style of the deck...  Odd Grimm tends to playout as turn 1-3 dropping aggressive dudes and removing a blocker while Tell a Fairy Tell decks tend to go for more incremental advantage and spend turn 1-2 setting up unless they happen to have an aggressive draw (which is uncommon). Turn 3 piper with maybe 1-2 resonators to back him up as opposed to 4-6 resonators plus a removal spell is a big difference in aggressiveness.
FoWtcg,388ihg,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:31:23 2015 UTC,I play with all 65. I guess you don't. More games are played post-sideboard than pre-sideboard. If you wanna call a deck that runs 15 non aggressive creatures main more aggro than a deck that runs 4-6 non aggressive creatures thats fine.
FoWtcg,388ihg,Some1Random,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"Guess what though, those Gilles come in for a more mid to late game playstyle! Surprise surprise! When you take out 1 drops and tempo cards and replace them with control cards and 6 drops it gets slower.. who could have guessed?!  Edit: Looking at the lists I realize you probably just have a very different definition of ""aggressive"" than I do. You seem to be counting Glinda and Little Prince as ""aggressive"" but not March Hare or Oz."
FoWtcg,388ihg,RamboJezus,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:46:26 2015 UTC,"Why don't you consider The Little Prince to be aggressive? Hunter, TLP, Loup Garou. That is aggressive but apparently you consider it midrange."

[Continuous] If a resonator dealt damage by added J/resonator would be put into a graveyard this turn, remove that resonator from the game and you gain life equal to its DEF instead.   so the game only sees once instance of the replacement - 'if...would be put into a graveyard this turn..."" - once you replace the effect one time the other trigger cannot resolve since the creature isn't going to the graveyard at that point.  hope this helps."

If I could take a stab at why, it might be the surging popularity of 'mono wind' elves with Hellsing ruler.  Most of those decks play Moojdart to get maximum effectiveness out of j-activating Christie, so there's a very narrow need for that specific stone.  I know that the control Grimm variants play it too but I don't think those are as popular now with the rise in popularity of Odd Grimm as well as Split Heaven and Earth to deal with."

Also, if my opponent targets one of my damage dealing resinators with Crime and Punishment and then I respond by targeting it with Little Red's activated ability to give it +200, will Crime and Punishment do X amount of damage but my resinator, after Little Red's effect, be X+2 and survive? Or would Crime and Punishment happen before I could respond with Little Red?   Last question, My opponent has a resonator and his Jruler Abdul Alhazred the Harbinger of Despair in play. Abdul's ability read's, ""[Activate] {0}: Target resonator or addition loses all abilities until end of turn. You may play this ability up to twice per turn.""  I have a Queen of Hearts and 2 card soldiers. The Queen's ability reads, "" [Activate] {Rest}, banish two Card Soldiers: Destroy target resonator."" It is my understanding that turning the card sideways and banishing the 2 soldiers are part of the cost for the effect to destroy a target.   If I use the Queen's ability and my opponent responds by targeting my queen with Abdul's ability, am I right to assume that my soldiers stay banished? And then does the Queen's ability still take effect or does Abdul's ability nullify it?  Thanks, just played my first few real games today so I'm still getting the hang of it.

FoWtcg,384e4o,IIDecayII,2,Sat Jun 6 06:11:09 2015 UTC,Your resonator takes no  damage as it has dealt none.

Activated  ability  of  J-ruler  with  included  in  required  action  can  be  played  if it's in your field continuously from  the beginning  of this turn. Automatic  Abilities    Automatic  abilities  are  abilities  with  text  ""[Continuous]  <effect>""  or  ""<effect>"", or  [Spell:  Chant-standby]  cards  in  hand  or  chant-standby  area,  and  need  to  meet any  condition  or  [Trigger]  to  play,  or  [Enter]  abilities.  Automatic  abilities  watch game  situation  and  if  its  trigger  condition  is  met,  it's  automatically  played  in priority  sequence. ▶  [Enter]  abilities  are  triggered  when  the  card  with  it  is  played  from  a  player's hand  and  put  from  chase  area,  or  when  judgment  resolved  and  J-ruler  is  put into  a  field.  If  the  card  is  put  into  chase  area  from  zones  without  playing  it from  hand,  or  the  card  comes  into  a  field  from  zones  other  than  chase  area, [Enter]  doesn't  trigger. Each  of  automatic  abilities  has  it's  condition  to  play  it.  It's  called  triggering condition.  If  the  condition  is  met,  number  of  triggered  times  of  the  ability  is increase  one.  If  the  number  of  triggered  times  of  an  ability  is  one  or  more,  the ability  is considered ""triggered"". ▶  Automatic  ability  of  [Spell:  Chant-Standby]  in  chant-standby  area  doesn't trigger in a turn that the card is put into that area. During  priority  sequence,  after  all  rule  process  resolved,  turn  player  checks  if  he or  she  controls  any  triggered  automatic  abilities.  If    he  or  she  do,  choose  one  of those  abilities  and  play  it,  then  decrease  the  number  of  triggered  times  of  that ability  one.  Then  non-turn  player  do  the  same,  and  repeat  it  until  no  abilities triggered left."

However, if that trigger condition is no longer true, you have lost your window of opportunity and have to wait until the next time the trigger condition is true.

However, Matt Kozmor, who has contacts with the core FoW team, confirmed that you can play Chant - Standby cards in the Removed Area as an instant.

When your opponent passes, you have the opportunity to play instant-speed cards or effects.  If you pass, then the opponent draws a card.  (If you somehow grant instant speed to Spiral of Despair, then the same situation applies as with Law of Silence.)  5.1 Draw Phase   ""At the beginning of turn"",""at the beginning of draw phase"" and, if this is the first turn of the game, ""at the beginning of game"" trigger conditions are happened.

EDIT: Jeanne cannot destroy Grimm, unfortunately.  Rule 2.5   Race or trait itself doesn't have any specified rules, though it is referred by some abilities and effects. If an effect refers race or trait without any zone it's in, it refers cards in a play ground with that race or trait.   The Ruler Area is part of the play ground.  This rule also allows ""Tinker Bell, the Spirit"" to gain an additional 200/200 if your Ruler is a fairy tale, like Puss n' Boots.  EDIT: However, Rule 10.9 does not allow destroy effects other than ""destroy ruler"" to affect Rulers. So, even though Jeanne's ability would normally affect Grimm, rule 10.9 requires a destroy effect to be ""destroy ruler"" specifically for this to happen.  10.9    If it's a ruler card in ruler area, it moves to owner's graveyard if the effect says ""destroy ruler"" specifically. If an effect says a card cannot be destroyed, all effects try to destroy that is ignored, and all rule process try to destroy the card is not fulfill its condition.   EDIT #2:  After talking to one of the newly appointed FoW judges, here is what really is happening.   Rule 2.5 is true. Rule 10.9 is also true.   However, Rule 1.4 (the Golden Rules) has a bullet point that says:   If an effect prohibit to do something and the other effect instructs to do that, prohibiting effect precedes.   So, in this case. Jeanne would destroy Grimm, but the rules say that you can't destroy rulers without a ""destroy ruler"" effect. Via Rule 1.4, because rule 2.5 says you can destroy ruler (because of Grimm's race) and 10.9 says you cannot destroy ruler, then 10.9 wins. Rule 2.5 never happens (for purposes of anything trying to trigger from destroy effects.)"

However, Rule 1.4 (the Golden Rules) has a bullet point that says:   If an effect prohibit to do something and the other effect instructs to do that, prohibiting effect precedes.   So, in this case. Jeanne would destroy Grimm, but the rules say that you can't destroy rulers without a ""destroy ruler"" effect.  In other words, Rule 2.5 says you can destroy a ruler (because of Grimm's race) and Rule 10.9 says you cannot destroy ruler, but Rule 1.4 ensures that Rule 10.9 takes precedence.

And theoretically they still should be able to follow that ability on the chase with Abdul's ability as well right? Where target resonator loses all abilities until end of turn because they are still a target-able entity until Feethsing resolves later on in the chase right?"
FoWtcg,384e4o,Higgle_Wiggle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:23:03 2015 UTC,"Spells in the Chase Area will try to resolve.  If a target is illegal, parts of that spell that dependent on the target don't happen.  Other parts of the card that are not dependent on the target still happen.  See Rule 9.3    Cards and abilities are resolved as below:  If the card or ability require to choose target, check the target at this point. If it's not legal, all the effects involving to it is not applied. Even if all the targets of the card or ability is illegal, the other effects not related with the targets is still resolved.     You may play abilities and spells when you have priority.  Spells and abilities are resolved one at a time, and after each resolution, turn player gains priority.  See the table in Rule 6 Priority Sequence.  Your thoughts about resolution are correct.  In your example, assuming you are the turn player.   You pass priority, because you have nothing else to play. Your opponent (non-turn player) has priority. Your opponent casts Thunder and targets your J-Ruler. Thunder is now put in the Chase Area as a normal spell. Your opponent passes priority. You have priority again. You respond by activating Feethsing, the Holy Wind Stone and target your J-Ruler that was targeted by Thunder.  Feethsing's ability enters the Chase Area. After this, you have priority. You pass priority. Your opponent has priority again. Your opponent activates Abdul Alhazred, the Harbinger of Despair's ability and targets a resonator on the field. Your opponent passes priority.  You have priority again. You pass priority.  Your opponent also passes priority. The Chase Area begins to resolve. Abdul Alhazred, the Harbinger of Despair's ability resolves first.  Targeted resonator loses all abilities until end of turn. You have priority now.  You pass priority, and your opponent also passes priority. Feethsing's ability resolves next.  The targeted J-Ruler now can no longer be targeted by spells or effects until end of turn. After Feethsing's ability resolves, you have priority.  You then pass priority.  Your opponent also passes priority. Thunder resolves.  It can't deal damage to the targeted J-Ruler, because Feethsing's ability prevents it.  Thunder is put in your opponent's graveyard."

What happens if the card you put in the standby zone, via 5.1 rules, is actually just a random resonator put there as bait?"
FoWtcg,384e4o,Higgle_Wiggle,2,Wed Jun 24 00:20:40 2015 UTC,"Your graveyard is your graveyard.  You control it.  See Rule 3.9 Graveyard   The zone destroyed or used cards are placed. Each  player  has  his  or  her  graveyard, its  public  and  order  of  the  cards  are managed. Any new cards put into a graveyard is put onto the top of the cards in it.     You cannot use Shooting Star to redirect Absolute Cake Zone to itself, as that would create an illegal target.  It's an inherent characteristic of canceling a spell or effect: You cannot use a spell or ability to target itself.  In addition, a ""change"" action must resolve into a different object.  However, you can use Shooting Star's ability to redirect the target of Absolute Cake Zone to Shooting Star.    By doing so, Shooting Star resolves first and changes Absolute Cake Zone's target to Shooting Star.  Shooting Star no longer exists, so Absolute Cake Zone has an illegal target.  That part no longer works.  If Absolute Cake Zone's controller controlled Gretel, he/she would still draw a card, since that part wasn't reliant on a target.  (See Rule 9.3)    If you are putting a card into the Chant - Standby Area for {2} Will, it doesn't use the Chase Area, so you cannot use spells or abilities to negate it.   It doesn't matter whether that card was a valid Chant - Standby card or a bluffed card.  See Rule 7.6   This  action  doesn't  use  chase  area,  and  put the  card when  he  or she  perform  the action."

FoWtcg,384e4o,tubbyfuu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:29:42 2015 UTC,Yes. Additions being cast (in the Chase Area) are normal spells.  Absolute Cake Zone will cancel normal spells.  Exceed will cancel normal and summon spells in the Chase Area.  See Rule 3.13 Chase Area.

FoWtcg,384e4o,ZeroArx,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:11:01 2015 UTC,"The card has errata.  The card must attack if able, meaning that if it's eligible to attack, you must choose it to participate in a battle.  If you just summoned Seven Dwarfs, it can't attack that turn.  But on your subsequent turns, you must attack with it."

FoWtcg,384e4o,RamboJezus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:12:16 2015 UTC,Can you block/counter Spell:Chant-Instant cards?
FoWtcg,384e4o,Higgle_Wiggle,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:02:36 2015 UTC,"Yes.  When you play a card, it will enter the Chase Area.  Once you give up priority, your opponent will get a chance to cast something to counter the spell."
FoWtcg,384e4o,RamboJezus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:20:41 2015 UTC,Cannot be chased by players. It can still be chased.
FoWtcg,384e4o,VodkaAlchemist,-2,Tue Jun 16 21:56:58 2015 UTC,"When you play a card in response to another card, it begins a chase. There is only one kind of chase."
FoWtcg,384e4o,Higgle_Wiggle,2,Wed Jun 17 23:19:37 2015 UTC,"What? You don't have to cast a card in response to another to have a ""chase"" (I really hate that word). Once a card is cast it goes on the chase. A chase has already begun. Anything that is added to the chase is on the chase. Sure players can't chase flames that doesn't mean a trigger from a creature or addition couldn't happen and be added to the chase. For example Mephistopheles ability when you target it with flames of the outer world."
FoWtcg,384e4o,VodkaAlchemist,2,Thu Jun 18 03:19:15 2015 UTC,Pretty much everything goes on the chase yo. A trigger from a card would still go on the chase if you cast flames. Basically it is possible for the game itself to add things to the chase. It is no different than in MTG.
FoWtcg,384e4o,Higgle_Wiggle,-2,Thu Jun 18 03:24:27 2015 UTC,I never said it was any different
FoWtcg,384e4o,VodkaAlchemist,2,Thu Jun 18 03:32:28 2015 UTC,Saying flames can't be chased implies that nothing else can be added to the chase while flames is on it. Flames can be chased just not by players as the card says.

FoWtcg,385nuj,Shmev265,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:57:46 2015 UTC,the sinbad builds are pretty bad.  The Quickcast version is pretty good. Green/black/red tends to be the best combo for any build you go with.

FoWtcg,385nuj,Maledicte,0,Tue Jun 2 23:25:53 2015 UTC,Scheherazade is an established control deck. It is very good. If you haven't found a strong list yet you're just not looking hard enough =P.   Something like this is generally what people are playing. THIS IS NOT A DECKLIST  4 Gretel 4 Cheshire cat  / Familiar of Holy Wind 4 Thunder 2 Morgianna 2 Exceed 4 xeex 3 Sinbad 0-2 Wind Dagger 3 Fiethsing 3 Cake Zone 3 1001 Stories 2-4 Gardea

FoWtcg,385nuj,Honfar95,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:34:50 2015 UTC,Alexsndr's Scheherazade list is pretty insane.  The deck greatly benefits from having blazer as a wincon

FoWtcg,385lyn,Taboggan,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"If you're going to run Cinderella, my guess is that you include Slipper of cinderella somewhere, as it'll beef her up a bit. I myself am running 2 Cinderella's, 2 Slipper of Cinderella and 2 deadman prince. Also perhaps another Vampire's Staff? The card is valuable to you as in your recovery phase you can potentially deal significant damage. I've only been playing the game for a couple of weeks so others may have better suggestions. My deck is mainly vampire with cinderella-type cards thrown in."
FoWtcg,385lyn,huntj09,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:29:53 2015 UTC,"Although running slippers are good for decks running Cinderella, it's not needed every time. I've got an Alice deck in which I run Cinderella purely to reshuffle my Cheshire cats. That's like the only useful thing she does. Not many things are affected by the 200 damage although it does help for those times when you're just a little short. The cool part about Cinderella is she targets player, not resonator. This allows you to get past ""hexproof"" creatures that can't be targeted, like Cheshire Cat"
FoWtcg,385lyn,Theoduin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:23:23 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I'm only fairly new, so there's probably better options out there. It's just what I run (I have 2 slippers in there and 2 princes), the rest are vampires."
FoWtcg,385lyn,huntj09,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:32:47 2015 UTC,"I suggest cutting Carmillas to either 2 or 3 as running 4 can end up as dead cards if you wish to J-activate early as turn 2/3 which is a powerful move to make against aggro decks that cannot deal with Dracula without spending most of their resources.  I would also suggest bumping Duel of Truth and Bloodsucking Impulse to 3 each so you can have more cards to allow you to steal resonators your opponent summons on their turn, allowing you better board control.  And run at least 3 servants as they can save your life once you j-activate since they help ensure the survival of Dracula from nasty spells like Flame of Outer World as well as Thunder as a response to Duel or when you attack.  Also, you could consider using a few Alvarez (+200/+200 to all vampires, includes Dracula) to allow your board to have greater presence."
FoWtcg,385l4n,Halt009,2,Tue Jun 2 00:37:56 2015 UTC,"I just built a zoo-type deck with Crimson Girl in the Sky. Her J-Ruler (Little Red, the True Fairy Tale) abilities are:   [Continuous] This card cannot be targeted by darkness or fire spells or darkness or fire card's abilities.  [Continuous] If a spell or ability would increase ATK or DEF of resonators you control, it increases double that much instead.  [Continuous] If a spell or ability would decrease ATK or DEF of resonators you control, it decreases none instead.  There are additions that buff your resonators, so she doubles the buff, and prevents 'de-buffing'."
FoWtcg,385l4n,jmillr,0,Tue Jun 2 00:58:56 2015 UTC,What are you running in the deck?
FoWtcg,385l4n,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:03:37 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that I haven't had a chance to test it yet, but this is what I came up with:  crimson // little red 3x gardea 3x fiethsing 4x gretel 4x hansel 3x oz, wizard 3x tin man 3x flying carpet 3x exceed 3x silver shoes 4x xeex 4x refarth 3x cottage cakes 9x wind 1x feethsing    It's mono-green to stop split heaven earth. If I had a sideboard, I'd probably include survivor of heaven's castle (built-in buff), sinbad, wolf in sky (built-in buff), maybe portal of truth, evolution of limits, or law of silence.  Thoughts or suggestions on the deck welcome."
FoWtcg,385l4n,jmillr,0,Tue Jun 2 03:14:39 2015 UTC,So that build is pretty close to the list in my budget deck thread but better obviously. Yours seems to be more tuned. Everyone seems to enjoy it and it is definitely able to aggro out a lot of decks that stumble for whatever reason.
FoWtcg,385l4n,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:36:37 2015 UTC,Alice is bad and Zoo isn't a creature combo deck. Zoo is an aggro deck. The closest thing to Zoo in this game is probably Odd Grimm aggro.
FoWtcg,385l4n,RamboJezus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:55:02 2015 UTC,"Grimm odd aggro? Grimm the Ruler seems pretty insane all by himself. How would that play out? And sad to hear about Alice but oh well, maybe in the future."
FoWtcg,385l4n,MagicianLord,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:13:46 2015 UTC,"The Grimm odd aggro deck mostly consists of low-cost Fairy Tale resonators (creatures).  Using Grimm as a ruler allows you to put Fairy Tale resonators from multiple attributes (colors) without necessarily dedicating magic stones (mana sources) for them.  ""Odd"" refers to all casting costs in the deck all having an odd casting cost.  That way, cards like March Hare and Dreams in Wonderland work the way the player intended."

FoWtcg,3847ls,Trebbinz,2,Tue Jun 2 03:51:04 2015 UTC,"6.2 doesn't work like it does in Magic.  Turn player picks one of his triggered abilities among all legal triggered abilities and resolves that.

Then, non-turn player goes and does the same thing."
FoWtcg,3847ls,MagicianLord,2,Tue Jun 2 18:38:12 2015 UTC,Thanks. Too many years of MTG and other card games make you skim over rules quite too often when you see similar patterns.

FoWtcg,3847ls,MagicianLord,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"You still get 1000 life.  The board wipe is simultaneous, so all cards see everything.

By carefully ordering his triggers, Player A will gain 1000 life.  Note that you pick the effect one at a time and resolve.  Then pick the next."
FoWtcg,383dj2,VaegaGumby,2,Mon Jun 1 15:49:27 2015 UTC,"For thematic relevance, you could look at these cards.  I can't say if the resulting deck will be any good, casually or competitively.  Cards are from the Grimm cluster.  Dragon-themed cards:   Falltgold, the Dragoon / Bahamut, the Dragon King (Ruler/J-Ruler card) Realm of the Dragon King Dragon King's Flame Gilles de Rais, the Golden Dragon Blazer, the Eater of Dimensions Yamata-no-Orochi, the Eight Disasters  Spawn of Blazer    Knight-themed cards:   Don Quijote, the Wandering Knight Gliding Dragon Knight Knight of Loyalty"

However, it's a rare in this game, so it's pretty expensive on the secondary market.  If you can wait until July, there will be a new standalone fixed box set (no boosters, 5 ready-to-go decks) called ""Engage Knights - Vingolf"" that will supposedly contain 2 Thunders and several dual magic stones (magic stones that provide 1 of 2 colors).  At a more competitive level, Split Heaven and Earth is another card you may want to look at.  This will probably be needed as a sideboard card.  Since the dual magic stones have no drawback whatsoever, the U.S. meta was full of these stones.  Entire magic stone decks did not have a single ""basic"" stone.  Since this card was released, the meta has adjusted for the most part as to not make their magic stone deck completely reliant on ""non-basic"" stones."
FoWtcg,383dj2,DaveStrudle,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:54:49 2015 UTC,"Direct burn of any form always makes sense in a Dragon deck. I'll keep an eye out for the new set. That mean they're releasing the forth part of the Grimm cluster as well as this ""Engage Knights - Vingolf""?"

FoWtcg,381ui8,Some1Random,1 point,Mon Jun 1 06:38:59 2015 UTC,"Also note that just like effects in some other card games once you go to reveal the top card you must resolve the rest of the effect before putting anything else on the chase.  If someone doesn't respond to you chasing Dreams once they see the top card is Odd they can't activate abilities on the card you are bouncing etc since revealing a card is part of the resolution you must wait for it to finish.  It is rarely relevant since most decks that run dreams won't run even spells anyways, but it has minor edge cases where it might be relevant."
FoWtcg,381ui8,MagicianLord,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"I interpret as if you want to counter or interact with Dreams of Wonderland, you would need to do it before Dreams of Wonderland resolves in the Chase Area.  Technically, the way this card is worded, you won't know which mode of the card is being used.  Because once it resolves, then that player reveals the top card.  At that point, it's too late for your opponent to interact with the spell.    It's supposed to be a chance-style card, but as Some1Random said, most builds that use this card are using all odd-numbered spells.  Even if it's in that kind of deck, you wouldn't know the target until the spell resolves."
FoWtcg,381ui8,RamboJezus,0,Mon Jun 1 14:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah in this game the word ""Otherwise"" seems to be used as ""If not"". Black Coffin of Vampire is worded the same way. It is just bad Engrish."
FoWtcg,3818aj,TheSandTrap,2,Mon Jun 1 02:48:09 2015 UTC,"1) the starter decks are based on the Valhalla block that did not get a US release, so they're cards not normally found in the states.    2)the sets ARG has listed are the 3 current sets out in the US and available to players in the states. It's hard telling how the format is gonna be following the next set which is the end of this current block/cluster of sets.     3) facebook group is great."
FoWtcg,3818aj,MaliciousJoy,2,Mon Jun 1 02:57:24 2015 UTC,"The only tournament formats that would permit the Valhalla starter decks are Origin: Valhalla or Origin: Bifrost.  Origin is basically an eternal format.  However, because the Vahalla starter decks and a handful of promo cards are from the Valhalla clusters (expansions), it appears most venues just don't want to deal with them.  In addition, the Lifebreak mechanic was apparently not popular when it was released elsewhere in 2014, so the game creators have supposedly said that they are not bringing back that mechanic any time soon.  Also, the Fire Valhalla starter deck's Ruler/J-Ruler is apparently broken.  So, the only reasons to buy the starter deck is to acquire cards from that expansion and find a venue that will support the Origin format.   The cards that are currently legal in the U.S. is the Grimm block cluster.  This is 3 sets currently available, a 4th set to be released in July, and a standalone fixed set (no boosters) called Engage Knights - Vingolf. Once the next cluster appears (the Alice cluster), there will also be the equivalent of MTG's Standard tournament format, which will only allow the two most recent clusters, Engage Knights, and Alice cluster starter. You should join the Facebook group; Force of Will - NA (North America).  You can also visit the official website and look under the stores supporting the game currently, although that will only tell you about retail support and not how large the player community is in any given state.  (Stores supporting the game are listed by U.S. state.)"
FoWtcg,38145j,Eucser,0,Mon Jun 1 02:12:19 2015 UTC,When you say they are you referring to an opponents owned longinus or your own? Kaguya doesn't affect your opponents treasury items.
FoWtcg,38145j,RamboJezus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:23:42 2015 UTC,I typed that weirdly I see it now.  If I have Longinus and have it attached to my Resonator can I keep changing the Instance during the same chase to negate everything that's going to happen to it during that chase. Example if they use Rapid Decay on my card then I change Longiuns to fire and they respond by Dreams of Wonderland can I change it to Water?
FoWtcg,38145j,Alexsndr1992,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:28:06 2015 UTC,You can endlessly keep chaining with Longinus /kaguya so you're safe
FoWtcg,38145j,Alexsndr1992,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:32:45 2015 UTC,Interesting I thought you wouldn't be able to since you're change it from Darkness To Fire in the first instance but then Darkness to Water in the second instance but since it's not Darkness anymore on the first instance it doesn't change.
FoWtcg,38145j,RamboJezus,2,Mon Jun 1 02:39:19 2015 UTC,"The chain just resolves backwards:   Player 1 uses Thunder on Resonator with Long.   Player 2 chases with kaguya to make long fire proof.  Player 1 chases with rabbit kick, attempt to return the same resonator.  Player 2 chases with kaguya again, picking water.  The chase resolves  Long turns water Rabbit kick fizzles  Long turns fire Thunder fizzles"

FoWtcg,380x3v,RamboJezus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:34:03 2015 UTC,so are we just going by logic here? is there anything in the comprehensive rules that covers this type of situation?
FoWtcg,380x3v,BadWolf117,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:52:29 2015 UTC,Yeah the part where it says do what the cards say. Hamelin doesn't care if the target is already rested otherwise it would say rest target recovered resonator like say inquisition does.

FoWtcg,380x3v,BadWolf117,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:27:07 2015 UTC,"I was referring section in the rules that says ""if a card seems to over rule these rules do what the card says"" or something along those lines. On a side note playing a card  the way it is meant to be isn't a 'ruling' that is merely playing the card as it is meant to be and having a card be explained because you don't understand it is also not a ruling. A ruling is when something is ambiguous and a judge must render a decision. An example being that your opponent drew an extra card off cheshire cat. The general ruling would be a game loss."

FoWtcg,37xtfx,RamboJezus,1 point,Sun May 31 13:40:07 2015 UTC,I am aware it almost can't win against burn. I have changed the Moon Shades though. added an extra BW dual and an extra RB dual instead.
FoWtcg,37xtfx,Mimic94,1 point,Sun May 31 14:02:07 2015 UTC,"Fun Fact, there are two ""Pandora, girl of the box""s. One flips to ""Pandora of Light"" and the other is ""Pandora of Dark"", which is the one you're using hopefully, with a hand mill deck. Just a heads up that you may want to refer to your ruler as the J-ruler's name.  I also just wrote an entire article on how i didn't like your water being in there and then I realized the meph, cheshire combo -.- Intentional or not, great job on finding that combo. I'll have to pick that one up.  I agree with RamboJezus though, those moon lights are gunna hurt. why not try this:   x2 Magic stone of Scorched Bales (B/R) x2 Magic stone of Light Vapors (W/b) x2 Magic stone of Dark Depth (B/b) x2 Magic stone of Heaven's Rift (B/W) x2 Magic stone of Hearth's Core (R/b) x2 Magic stone of Heat Ray (W/R)   Then you could have 6 mana of every color you use, and It'd be pretty hard to get mana boned. If you want to keep yourself at 10 mana, then you might take out a (R/b) and a (B/W). then you'll still have 5 of each color available to you."
FoWtcg,37xtfx,Mimic94,1 point,Sun May 31 15:43:17 2015 UTC,"If the Cheshire combo you're talking about is just to re use them that was intentional. If there is something else there, no.  I am using the dark Pandora as my main ruler and siding the light Pandora. Speaking of light Pandora, if I have Seth out and activate light Pandora, I should get Seth triggers to return resonators from grave top hand, yes?  I'm not a fan of non black stones as most of my deck needs double black very badly. I think the deck needs the following. All stones make black. At least five make blue, at least three white and at least two red. I'm not sure of a configuration that can make this work. Maybe it could work if one didn't make black or if we used a moon stone (not the pay life one).  I will start using the post activation names now for more clarity."
FoWtcg,37xtfx,Mimic94,1 point,Sun May 31 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"I meant using meph to send cheshire back to your deck. However, I just realized that it cant work because cheshire cant be targeted by spells or abilities.  Pandora of Light should trigger Seth  I didnt notice all the double black costs. thats a good point.  Marzka has a good set up. I don't think you need 5 blues. you only have 8 blue cards in your deck and each one only needs 1 blue mana."

FoWtcg,37xtfx,Marzka,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:34:53 2015 UTC,His balck is too heavy to run stones that dont have black in them he should do something like a 3 3 4 split of the stones something like:  -3x Dark Depth  -3x Scorched Bales  -4x Heaven's Rift
FoWtcg,37xtfx,Mimic94,1 point,Sun May 31 18:26:42 2015 UTC,All of his stones rest for black.     Edit: nvm you're responding to the other guy my bad.
FoWtcg,37xtfx,RoboGunner,1 point,Sun May 31 18:54:59 2015 UTC,Lol. Yeah. Actually your comment made me look back at the numbers and I might suggest that he could run 4 Dark Depths instead of 3. I dont know the numbers. Maybe having 4 makes it a bit easier to cast Cheshire Cat on turn one or two. And he also has Mermaid so maybe 4 is the right number. Drop one of the Heaven's Rift for a Dark Depths seems good from the list I provided before.

FoWtcg,37xfb8,sunatori,1 point,Sun May 31 06:36:33 2015 UTC,It doesn't go in every deck but you play it in the late game and it's like you drew 15 cards for 3 mana. You just start machine gunning your opponents board with all of the removal in your graveyard and countering all their stuff. Also synergizes nice with Scheherazade since you just draw 2 cards off her ability when you discard end of turn.

FoWtcg,37xb7h,sabett,2,Sun May 31 04:23:21 2015 UTC,Some locations do a draft event. Usually the person picks a ruler they own or use a proxy or use a ruler if they pull one. The actual promos are usually a buy a box unless they are the alternate art cats which I've seen come only in 1 in 3 boxes.  Foils are only tied to rares and super rares and all rares and super rares are foil. The different rulings are called either Bifrost or Valhalla. Valhalla means you play with the lifebreak mechanic while in Bifrost you don't.
FoWtcg,37xb7h,Connert73,1 point,Sun May 31 04:47:48 2015 UTC,So is draft not a typical way to play the game? Does it feel awkward? I'm asking because I cube games.  Is Bifrost or Valhalla more popular? Is one considered to be more casual?
FoWtcg,37xb7h,Mimic94,3,Sun May 31 04:54:02 2015 UTC,"Drafting doesn't usually work too well, though some stores try anyway for shits and giggles.  Bifrost is more popular. Valhalla is old rules that never actually made it to the USA.  *edit to fix spacing"

FoWtcg,37xb7h,RamboJezus,1 point,Sun May 31 07:15:10 2015 UTC,How does draft work for this game? How do you get a J-Ruler when there's only 2 in a box? And also do you have to draft your stones or are they given to you just like with Magic draft?
FoWtcg,37xb7h,Marzka,1 point,Sun May 31 18:18:24 2015 UTC,You proxy the rulers from the cluster. 20 cards if no lifebreak 24 if lifebreak. 8 stones minimum you leave stones in the pack. Basics are provided. If you open a ruler its just like innistrad you announce it and go about your business you can take it if you want but in try hard drafts there is no reason to. If you open a god pack you announce it and the tournament organizer gives you a new pack.
FoWtcg,37xb7h,RamboJezus,1 point,Sun May 31 18:28:25 2015 UTC,Oh ok. Seems legit. Ill have to tell my LGS about it. Now if you pull a god pack do you get to have the cards that are in it?

FoWtcg,37xb7h,Mimic94,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm, is that because cards are too narrow? That they only really work within a particular archetype?  What's going on the released sets? I see 6 on the search engine, but for the first three, from valhalla, I can only find starters for one of them and nothing from the other 2."
FoWtcg,37xb7h,RamboJezus,3,Sun May 31 05:49:52 2015 UTC,"Certain things work well with themselves, but most cards have a combo that makes it work to its fullest. I wouldn't say that the cards are narrow though. Things DO work, and sometimes rather hilariously. We had a game where a Shallows Giant Dolphin killed its owner after turning into a vampire and gaining flying off of a magic carpet.  The visuals are wonderful.  However, I think you can kind of grasp how bumpy the road can be for playing the game as a draft mode.  I don't know terribly much about Valhalla, but i think that one set is ONLY the starter packs, and the other 2 arent readily available in the US. again, dont quote me on that.  The other 3 are CMF, TAT, and MPR, which are all being sold in the states. amazon has all of it, or you can support your local game store that probably has a couple boxes."

FoWtcg,37whzc,jmillr,1 point,Sun May 31 01:39:57 2015 UTC,The Musketeers deck is very bad lol  The grim aggro deck might be the best deck in the format right now you can probably find a list if you look around.
FoWtcg,37whzc,MagicianLord,1 point,Sun May 31 01:41:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing your list. Any thoughts on what to watch out for when playing it?
FoWtcg,37whzc,MagicianLord,1 point,Sun May 31 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"Each player requires the following:   Exactly 1 ruler/J-Ruler card: This is a dual-faced card that has abilities on it.  It starts off on the ruler side, and depending on the conditions on the card, you will be able to flip it to the J-Ruler side for increased power and abilities, including the ability to attack and block.  The ruler/J-Ruler is sort of like MTG Commander in that you often build your deck around the rulerJ-Ruler card.  Certain cards in the game gain alternate modes or boosted abilities if you are playing a specific ruler/J-Ruler.  The ruler/J-Ruler is also needed to call your magic stones (draw a stone from the magic stone deck). Magic Stone deck: Between 10-20, inclusive, of magic stone cards.  Magic Stones are mana for this game. Main Deck: 40 or more cards that are not ruler or magic stone cards.   Each player starts with 4000 life, and the objective is to get the opponent to 0 life or to deck them.  Turn order and priority handling are similar to Magic: The Gathering but not quite exact.  Battling is handled one resonator at a time, like Hearthstone.  If you are serious into the game, you'll want to read the Comprehensive Rules (CR).  Here is the link to the rules off the official English FoW site: http://fowtcg.com/pdf/FoW_CR_5.01_150331.pdf (I was told by jmillr that the link in this subreddit is no longer working.)  There are no sites for deck lists, since the game is very new.  As already mentioned, you can find a few players creating ""deck tech"" Youtube videos.  There is also an unofficial, but large ""U.S. Force of Will"" Facebook group that you can join and try to ask questions."

FoWtcg,37wf8n,azul360,1 point,Sat May 30 23:32:14 2015 UTC,"You can't make a cohesive deck with just this set.  You need at least cards from Crimson Moon's Fairy Tale (CMF) set to make.  This set alone leans slightly toward Fairy Tale Resonator types, but the cards to support this type are in the CMF set."
FoWtcg,37wf8n,MagicianLord,1 point,Sat May 30 23:56:31 2015 UTC,Oh ok so I would need both is what you're saying? That kind of sucks but thank you for the help :).  Would you think after getting this set to just make as much of a deck as possible that I like and then order singles from there or to get boxes from both?
FoWtcg,37wf8n,MagicianLord,1 point,Sun May 31 00:00:28 2015 UTC,"I recommend one box from each set, so you could gather most of the uncommons and commons you need to make any deck and have some rares and super rares left over for trade or experimentation.  Theoretically, you could buy singles after The Castle of Heaven and Two Towers you just bought, but you would need to know what kind of deck you want to make with Crimson Girl in the Sky/Little Red, the True Fairy Tale if that is the bare minimum deck you want to make.  If that is the case, you'll want to pick up a playset of Xeex the Ancient Magic as part of your shopping list.  It's a good card with or without Crimson Girl in the Sky/Little Red, the True Fairy Tale."
FoWtcg,37wf8n,Locke_Kosta,1 point,Sun May 31 01:30:51 2015 UTC,I'm new to the game so I honestly don't know what I can make with her. I just know i want her as the ruler.
FoWtcg,37wf8n,MagicianLord,1 point,Sun May 31 03:10:33 2015 UTC,"Fair Warning: One box of each is not going to get you there. You won't have any rares or super rares ""left over for trade"". You probably won't have a playset of anything other than most of the uncommons and commons, which isn't going to make a very a strong competitive deck if that's what you're looking for.   As with all card games, if you're looking for a competitive deck at the lowest possible cost, it's best to buy singles. Do some research to find a competitive deck you like and just piece it together. You can find them singles on coretcg.com and ideal808.com at the moment. I'm sure there are a few others if you search around and there's always ebay."
FoWtcg,37wf8n,twinrhapsody,1 point,Sun May 31 05:06:58 2015 UTC,"The OP might have some cards for trade from a single box of each if he wants to build a specific deck.  If he wants to build a 4-attribute or 5-attribute deck, you would be right.  I thought that he wanted a 2-attribute deck that wasn't necessarily competitive, which he could build something with only 2 booster boxes and have some off-color cards for trade."
FoWtcg,37wf8n,Mimic94,1 point,Sun May 31 13:07:39 2015 UTC,"You CAN make a decent Oz stompy deck with cards purely from Two Towers. It's not the most competitive deck, but it's by no means BAD."

FoWtcg,37vuan,Sqewer,1 point,Sat May 30 23:58:48 2015 UTC,Not until the rules change officially. The facebook group is usually on top of the rules changes if nothing else.
FoWtcg,37vuan,RamboJezus,1 point,Sun May 31 01:24:53 2015 UTC,Seems like an odd rules change. I haven't noticed anything wrong with the current way they work. Do you know what happened to cause this change and what is their explanation for it?
FoWtcg,37vuan,RamboJezus,1 point,Sat May 30 21:08:53 2015 UTC,Agreed the rule change seems to allow all 5 color standbys in any deck.
FoWtcg,37vuan,MagicianLord,1 point,Sat May 30 22:13:11 2015 UTC,That is precisely why I thought it was odd.     @Nerogenesis you are correct. Chant - Standbys at the current point in time must be played face down and can only be activated the turn after they are set and you meet the requirements to flip it. They cannot currently be cast without having been played face down first.
FoWtcg,37vuan,RamboJezus,1 point,Sat May 30 22:17:50 2015 UTC,One explanation given by someone who has some contacts in the Italian and Japanese branches was that Chant - Standby cards were not being used in any significant manner in tournaments.  None of the top 8 decks in the recent Japan Spring Open had any Chant - Standby cards.  The game creators adjusted the rules to get that card type to see some tournament play.
FoWtcg,37vuan,jmillr,1 point,Sun May 31 00:00:56 2015 UTC,I wonder if they realize that these new rules kind of make them absurdly strong. You can literally play them in any deck no matter what color. Doesn't make sense.
FoWtcg,37vuan,RamboJezus,1 point,Sun May 31 00:03:40 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen the Facebook post, but I'm pretty sure that you will have to pay the will cost on the front of the card to cast it as an instant."
FoWtcg,37vuan,jmillr,1 point,Sun May 31 00:30:01 2015 UTC,I was referring to flipping it without having the right stones.
FoWtcg,37vuan,MagicianLord,1 point,Sun May 31 00:31:12 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, now I see. If they do make that change, any standby chant could be used in any deck. Will probably increase the use of those cards."
FoWtcg,37vuan,Sqewer,1 point,Sun May 31 01:56:59 2015 UTC,"Several players made the same observation as you.   It looks like the game creators will try these revised rules for Chant - Standby cards and see what happens over the course of the next tournament season.    Under the revised rules, if you set a Chant - Standby card by paying {2}, you still can't play it on the same turn you set them.  Casting one as an instant requires the trigger condition to be fulfilled and then you have to pay the will cost."
FoWtcg,37vpeb,fpsmage,4,Sat May 30 20:08:50 2015 UTC,"Its commonly accepted that the red starter ruler is ridiculous in any format- I mean yeah, the red deck is pretty bonkers."
FoWtcg,37vpeb,Nyte_Crawler,3,Sat May 30 20:28:36 2015 UTC,"I think everyone is going to agree with that sentiment. Ushuah is super strong and the deck overall is just better than the others. That being said the starters are fairly bad. In July we are getting new starters and are getting a sort of deckbuilders toolkit. if you're new I'd recommend you pick up a starter and the deckbuilders toolkit as they will have MANY cards that are played in high level competitive decks. Thunders, Stonings, 2 of each dual stone, many rulers. Just really great value and awesome for new players just getting into the game."

FoWtcg,37vpeb,MagicianLord,1 point,Sat May 30 22:01:13 2015 UTC,"""Engage Knights - Vingolf"" is a standalone fixed (no booster packs) set containing the cards that RamboJesus mentioned.  If you get two of them, you'll have a playset of many of the core cards.  In addition, in July, there will be a new starter deck called ""Alice Cluster Prologue Faria/Melgis Dual Deck Set Box.""  It is described like a ""MTG Duel Deck"" with two rulers battling each other."

FoWtcg,37te9j,RamboJezus,1 point,Sun May 31 20:33:03 2015 UTC,The junk deck uses whispers from the abyss to generate intentional life loss. I prefer the First Lie in the decks that run red though.     I'm sure someone will disagree with me but they are more or less the same card in function. Just personal preference as to which is better. That is my opinion anyway.
FoWtcg,37te9j,RamboJezus,1 point,Sun May 31 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can see what you're saying there, With the Red/White deck First Lie is an obvious must for the life loss. The more I look at the deck lists though, the harder it is for me to choose which once I want more. The only thing that's getting me right now are the dual stones."
FoWtcg,37te9j,Fotonurth,1 point,Sun May 31 22:33:49 2015 UTC,Whispers is 100% reliable for a lot of life loss. With the first lie your opponent could in theory end up paying the life because they pick a higher number however in a red deck you're likely running Thunder and Split and overall you're just more aggressive. So if they end up paying >1500 you could just straight up kill them. So you win either way

Origin: Bifrost - All cards released in U.S., but Lifebreak mechanic is not used.  Any references to Lifebreak, [Break], and Lifebreak Area are ignored. Block (Grimm) - All cards from the Grimm Cluster (CMF, TAT, MPR, and the 4th cluster in July 2015)   It appears most stores are following either Block or Origin: Bifrost.  Block would make the Valhalla starter decks illegal.  Origin: Bifrost weakens the starter decks considerably. Check with the venue holding the tournament to confirm."

FoWtcg,37s9tn,GirlPunches,1 point,Sat May 30 08:28:16 2015 UTC,"If you buy 1 or 2 boxes, either set will get you your money's worth.   After that, you may want to hunt down singles.  In my opinion, TAT boxes has the most value due to a single card: Cheshire Cat, the Grinning Remnant.  It's a very, very good card if you want to play Water.  If you try to buy this card individually, you'll be paying at least $25-$30 for it (you want to buy TAT boxes instead if you have a little more money and feel lucky).  Both boxes have dual stones.  CMF focuses on opposing attributes.  TAT focuses on allied attributes.  You're more likely to get more Ruler cards out of CMF than TAT (TAT averages 2 Rulers per box; CMF averages 3-4).  I recommend trying eBay for singles.  It's trickier but you can sometimes get a good bargain there.  If you have a LGS that is carrying the game, you should buy some things from there to support them and to let them know you are interested in the game."
FoWtcg,37rrzm,hensomm,2,Fri May 29 21:31:31 2015 UTC,Buy two. You get all the dual stones. Worth.

As the other guy said green is the color that has counter spells in it but blue does come with some nice bounce. Also what kind of control are you looking for? I've played many card games so feel free to use other card games you've played as examples
FoWtcg,37r50p,anubis418,1 point,Fri May 29 20:03:59 2015 UTC,Main reason for blue is that I have card support from the starter deck and I don't have enough collection for green yet
FoWtcg,37r50p,RamboJezus,2,Sat May 30 02:12:48 2015 UTC,No offense but that's a terrible reason for that color. Find a control deck that you'd actually enjoy and start working towards it.
FoWtcg,37pf1r,lachlanweber,1 point,Fri May 29 10:42:45 2015 UTC,"Other little red would be better, imo. The stat ramp is incredible.  EDIT: and the deck stands on its own without her, making her just a quicker way to finish."
FoWtcg,37pf1r,Kevinw778,1 point,Fri May 29 11:07:32 2015 UTC,"Looked over the cards (and i do know its 6 over atm) but I think you need to figure out what you want this deck to do. You have 24 1 drops (edit for reasonators alone), 18 if you take the 6 out of there and 12 don't have much to do with the decks typing (though draw power is good).  Basically it seems like there werewolves are the main focus with the wererabbits as the ""backup"" so I would save the room on the pale moons and get some more removal/buffing spells.  I would at least remove the Hunter in black forest and replace him with Moon Night Pouncer as it gives you potential swiftness and first strike."
FoWtcg,37pf1r,UnknownSide,1 point,Fri May 29 11:52:12 2015 UTC,"I just assumed having more one drops would be better.  What the deck is really aiming to do is just to abuse little red to pop a card almost every turn. I also like the Wererabbits for their flying and draw power but might cut down the deck to focus on an aggressive werewolf build with some blue draw power. Honestly though I would still rather run the pale moons and I already dropped the 4 tsukuyomi moon city before I posted here. Anyway, what do you think of these changes: -4 pilot of the universe -2 swordsman of the full moon -4 Cheshire Cat  +4 moon night pouncer  I'd rather keep hunter in Black Forest because of the swiftness and ability to push for quick damage."
FoWtcg,37pf1r,UnknownSide,1 point,Fri May 29 12:36:22 2015 UTC,"It's not that the one drops are bad, its just some of the 2drops etc will do  more for your deck (edit in the long run). Moon night pouncer is an example of this, while it doesn't automatically have swiftness it has the ability to gain it and first strike which can be very strong, especially once your WW's attack gets boosted. The hunters are fine, but they will generally stay 300/300 and don't count towards things like Loup-Garou. The suggestion for pale moon is basically asking, ""How much value will i get out of this vs. the wererabbits normal abilities"" which are really good especially with the flying."
FoWtcg,37oxht,spiritseekerpsp,3,Fri May 29 06:35:23 2015 UTC,So essentially what you want to do for a base sideboard is this.    Look at the strategy of your main deck and ruler. Consider what colors you have and are using. Find the weaknesses in both of those. Look at your locals and what kind of decks are played there.  Look at the cards in your colors that help you counter and win against those decks but didn't make it into the main deck.  Play full matches with siding included to see if the cards you chose were good or if you need to tweak your choices any.  Repeat step 6 until you have a side board you are comfortable with.   That's generally how it goes for me and my friends. If you need am in depth guide to the best side board cards for different colors I can do that too.
FoWtcg,37oxht,foxygrandpa,1 point,Fri May 29 10:15:36 2015 UTC,"One of the most confusing things for me I guess would be different rulers in your sideboard.    To me, that seems like a huge strategic shift that isn't present in other CCGs.   Do you have any examples of when you'd switch rulers?"
FoWtcg,37oxht,Kevinw778,1 point,Fri May 29 11:06:27 2015 UTC,"If you were playing a little red wolf (low Def), and you're playing against a deck full of direct damage (thunder x_x), you will make little use of her unless you can guarantee her safety with the other cards in your deck. This can be fairly easily done, it just takes more care on your end, and due to her imminent flipping, can limit your deck's potential at various stages of the game.  So at this point you'd switch to a Ruler that can synergize just as well if not just a little less so, but will not die to such things as direct damage so easily. In this specific case, Snow, and obviously have other necessary cards sideboarded."
FoWtcg,37oxht,foxygrandpa,1 point,Fri May 29 11:13:55 2015 UTC,I do because that's what I do with my deck! So basically I play blue green black Abdul but I side into dark pandora. I even go as far as taking green out for the white needed for her. I do this more because Abdul struggles with certain matchups like Dracula and Cain. But both of these decks can't do anything without a hand if they don't have an established board. So smokescreening into Pandora dark helps me to slow the game down to the pace that I want it to be. But this all depends on what you are running and if it is convenient enough to just switch rulers to help your strategy. If not then it really isn't needed.
FoWtcg,37oxht,RamboJezus,0,Fri May 29 11:16:23 2015 UTC,I think you should try Flames of the Outer world if Cain is giving you troubles.
FoWtcg,37oxht,foxygrandpa,1 point,Fri May 29 12:24:26 2015 UTC,There is that one little thing that I don't play red in my list. Like I said I play blue green black and with side it turns into blue white black.
FoWtcg,37oxht,RamboJezus,0,Fri May 29 12:29:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I know you said BUG and side out green for white. I was suggesting trying flames instead of doing that. Dark Pandora is typically boarded for control matchs anyway. I find it odd that you use her for Cain.
FoWtcg,37oxht,foxygrandpa,1 point,Fri May 29 12:36:51 2015 UTC,My reasoning behind it is this. I have good chump blockers for the early game. Once mephestophales hits the board Cain is pretty much done and all I need to worry about is his burn cards. And if he doesn't have a hand then he is reduced to top decking which means its pretty much game from there. Abdul usually doesn't have a hard time with Cain anyway but siding into Pandora for a game also helps making any sides he has made less helpful or even just completely dead.
FoWtcg,37oxht,Kevinw778,1 point,Fri May 29 12:48:18 2015 UTC,"You pick out the possible weaknesses /counters to your deck, and build a sideboard off of that. Meaning you'll have to find cards in your main deck that you're okay with letting go of. Another way to go about it is to have cards that deal with common themes that people seem to be running a lot and side in cards after realizing what your opponent is playing."
FoWtcg,37ofsh,V-nagandr,3,Fri May 29 03:29:54 2015 UTC,"The top meta rulers right now are: Grimm, Grimmia, Scherezade, Bahamut, Dracula, Abdul.  Within those rulers there are variations, but similar playstyles.   Grimm nowadays tends to be more aggressive and a lot of builds flood the board.   Grimmia tends to be more mid-range control with a strong finisher with the ruler.  Scherezade tends to be multi-color control, slow with lots of counter spells.  Bahamut is fast mostly fire, but has long game with tutors for Dragons if necessary.  Dracula and Abdul are pretty much the same deck but Dracula does better against aggro matchups due to the life gain and multiple resonator stealing. Abdul tends to be much better in other matchups and can win grindy games with his abilities pretty easily."
FoWtcg,37ofsh,Some1Random,2,Fri May 29 14:14:37 2015 UTC,From what I've seen/hears as well is that hellsing is a sudo anti-meta deck due to her free flip and ability to deal with the rulers that keep coming back. I may be wrong just going off what I've read
FoWtcg,37ofsh,anubis418,2,Fri May 29 15:47:10 2015 UTC,She isn't a deck... but she shows up in sideboards from time to time because she crushes Dracula. Any deck that doesn't need their ruler for their plan specifically can use her in the board. In recent times it has mostly been Grimmia decks.
FoWtcg,37ofsh,Some1Random,2,Fri May 29 15:57:43 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Currently I'm playing a control deck with her as my ruler cause I like her and her silver bullets are amazing. Gonna be putting her to the side once I get Abdul though. Can't decide between him and alucard so I'm gonna try them both and see hahah

FoWtcg,37ofsh,Tonitrui,2,Fri May 29 12:52:20 2015 UTC,I wouldn't use exodia as an example cause exodia is the lowest of the low decks to play since its 100% solitaire.
