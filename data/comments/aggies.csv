aggies,3e5dnf,Killeener,15,Wed Jul 22 02:15:13 2015 UTC,"Those who will make it all four years will make it for a reason. If you want to be more marketable towards future employers try working on different aspects which make you more interesting.  Join active groups, find hobbies and if you are willing, ask for research. Having these on your resume will make you stand out. A&M's engineering school is good for a reason, and even though the size will increase in the future, the classes will be at the same difficulty."
aggies,3e5dnf,minicoz,9,Wed Jul 22 02:31:35 2015 UTC,Agreed. The School just realizes that there's a major need in the country for engineers and they're trying to get more students to work toward that major. It doesn't mean they're going to make getting the degree any easier
aggies,3e5dnf,hunterhicks1,11,Wed Jul 22 03:25:28 2015 UTC,"Going to be honest here, and I'm prepared for the backlash. Soon to be grads, and recent grads within my engineering department are not thrilled about this initiative. Mind you, I'm NOT speaking for the whole Engineering department, only speaking from my group of friends and classmates whom I've discussed this 25x25 initiative with. They feel that this could tarnish A&M's engineering prestige, thus labeling the engineering department as a diploma mill of sorts. Think quality over quantity, however the 25x25 implies that quantity over quality is far more important.  Maybe I'm just being a bitter student, or maybe I'm just ready to graduate and leave the school scene - however I feel that this is purely all about money. Money. Money. Money. Or perhaps A&M is hoping the likes of an Elon Musk, Bill Gates, or Mark Zuckerberg may roam the halls of Zachry and create an amazing startup where A&M could then slap their name on it and claim home to Startup X because so and so was a student here.  I've also spoken to several engineering professors - some have mixed feelings, some lean towards the negative end, and ultimately of course you also have the 'must remain positive and hopeful' type professors.  Do not however let these rumors, folklore, hush hush, opinions, or 'future projections' of A&M's engineering department derail or even discourage you from coming to A&M. If engineering is what you want to study, and you've had your sights set on Texas A&M then by all means! (I mean this in a good and positive way).   A&M has a great engineering department, regardless of which college you choose (MEEN, ECEN, AERO, etc) you will be challenged, you will have a reality check, and you will know by the end of your academic career that it was worth it. I've made so many great friends in my major, through study sessions, all-nighters, dinner parties, movies, sports, and whatever you can think of - these friends, some may become brothers to you, some may become your ticket into that dream company you want to work with. Ultimately, the college experience is not something written on a brochure, not something you've heard from your peers, or something you've seen on TV, it's not a promise nor a guarantee; it's what YOU make of it regardless of what school, major, or city you choose.   To respond to your last concern, where companies might think less of you because of the 'dwindling' prestige of A&M. From my own experience, and from experiences shared to me from my friends; as it stands now, mentioning you're an Engineering graduate from Texas A&M still garners a lot of respect and within good reason too. I've been shared true stories from friends who have landed great high paying jobs due to the Aggie status, some have gotten at least their foot in the door because of that, and others market the Aggie brand to make business since it's proven to work. Granted, in order for this to work you obviously need to have a good GPA, research, internships/coops and great skills under your belt (or AT least know someone from within the company). What I'm saying is, the A&M brand can only do so much but without a good resume/gpa/experience do not by any means hope that it is enough just to land you a great first job. Later down the road, experience and skills matter WAY more than your school or gpa.  Like I stated in the beginning, these are my opinions from being an engineering student for the past 4yrs. Do I fear that A&M's name might become mediocre by 2025? I do because getting this degree was not a walk in the park, but want to know something? - By 2025, A&M's name will be the least of my concerns since by then myself and everyone else who graduated will already be well into their careers (as will you). I'm only expressing concerns for the future generation of students."
aggies,3e5dnf,solidxmike,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:06:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how increasing the number of students over 10 years by hiring new professors and building/expanding classroom and lab buildings will make TAMU's engineering program less prestigious. If they were trying to add 10,000 students in 1 year, then I'd say you have a point. However, they are implementing a plan to expand their student body without compromising quality, which is why it will take them 10 years to reach it."
aggies,3e5dnf,PR0ficiency,2,Wed Jul 22 06:15:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of people feel like the engineering department is going in the wrong direction.   For example, a lot of people have heard horror stories about freshmen who had to take a year of general education before being allowed to apply to engineering (and oftentimes not getting what they want.) As if a person will just change their career plans on a dime or that it's ok to get a student to pay a years worth of tuition and tell them nevermind.  With the 25x25 initiative, the general sentiment I've heard is that the engineering department can't handle all the students it has now. Labs are often full, with a good chunk of equipment unusable, classes are often filled up before underclassmen can even try to get a spot, near-constant degree plan changes create lots of confusion and misinformation (speaking of which, as a Chem-e, I definitely feel that pain), among other issues. Again, I believe the general thought is that they're not adequately providing for us now, and that the 25x25 initiative will exacerbate the ongoing issues even further instead of pumping enough money into it to magically make everything better.  In the end though, I believe an aggie ring and degree will almost always put you ahead in a company's eyes. Aggies usually earn their degrees and gain plenty of respect for doing so. I think the only thing that could diminish that would be the flipped classroom idea, if implemented widely and poorly over a long enough time span. But their figures say it worked in math/english so I guess my personal opinion isn't really anything to go off of. (then again, the study was on freshman high school classes, not engineering coursework)  (Rant time)  Personally, I took Statics (a MEEN class) which made use of online lectures and I hated it. Lectures were still regular in class and the only in class activities were examples, both of which were repeated (I won't say verbatim, but they were the same material and examples) in online lectures. The online lectures were 3 hours a week, every week, and had quizzes every monday over them. The problem was that the online lectures included a sentence or two which wasn't course material that we were told the quiz would be over. So essentially we had to go to the lectures for in-class work and quizzes, then watch them again online so we could find the answers to the quiz which not only wasn't course material, but wasn't even anything useful.  Also regarding byod: the worst part about byod isn't that the only reasons they cite to require the specific computers was solved by the Virtual Open Access Lab, not that they are now required, despite being proposed (and defended) as only recommended, and not even that the prices they offer are more than a couple hundred dollars higher than retail, but that they would recommend a mac for engineers.  edit: corrections as I obsessively read and reread what I typed."
aggies,3e5dnf,TheTamrielTerror,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:56:02 2015 UTC,"They have restructured the freshman level engineering courses several times, but it's getting better every time. Also, be prepared to be rejected from your intended engineering field if you don't take the time to go above and beyond. I know several freshman who didn't get into what they wanted (AERO, MEEN, ECEN, etc) even though they had a GPA around 3.0.   You'll go in as ""General Engineering"" and will end up applying to a specific discipline. Don't make the mistake of choosing Aerospace because you like airplanes, or Computer Science because you like computers, etc.  If you follow the advice of the others in this thread you'll find a way to be a part of an engineering team at your dream company."

It could be that in order to accommodate so many students, the quality/standards have to drop. Or it could be that having more engineers at A&M brings more interest from companies. We just have to watch it all unfold. If that answer doesn't really help, keep in mind that even if 25 by 25 causes the quality to drop a bit, A&M engineering will still be pretty close to the top, at least for a public university."

Its just news and (imo) academic competition.  There are still companies that will hire you above another equally qualified degree holder from another well-recognized university for the sole reason it is A&M. Aggies in hiring positions will favor you. Longhorns in hiring positions will not favor you.  A&M is not and will likely never be MIT or another site of holy innovations as /u/solidxmike talked about a little bit. However, this does not change the fact that getting an engineering degree from A&M is still a very strong accomplishment you can be proud of. It is something I couldn't do and when I botched it horribly it was something I was not allowed a second chance at attaining.  Unfortunately, learning calculus at Blinn/Long Star/TCC is deemed less of an accomplishment than learning it at A&M. Personally I didn't pass a single calc at a university and personally believe I learned more from these community college instructors.  My person experience with A&M was less optimistic and I got signals from most staff that they cared less about me and more about my money. After a degree switch and burning some bridges, I'm now set to graduate from TTU with a B.S. in Geophysics. Still love the A&M culture but I'm far happier here at Tech. <end personal bitching> Side note: the engineering department here doesn't come across as better than A&M's"

It's a lot smaller than a fish-camp and the counselors don't treat you like a child and really focus on the school traditions and making new friends. They already know that you know how to be a college student and know you already understand the importance of going to class. Instead they break you up into groups where you just get to know each other. There are parties every night (no alcohol obviously) where you go out and get to know people. All the campers go through what i call ""brain washing"" sessions because it is all about learning the yells and the traditions and you'll leave a converted aggie. Most of my friends on campus I have made at t-camp. Don't worry, so many people will tell you that but it is true.

Some guy above said being a student worker isn't a ""real job"", which I honestly think is a dumb thing to say. There is an ANSC facility off of University that you can likely find a job at -- ask around. The ANSC dept is large and has a lot of opportunities.  I was a student worker, but I was conducting research that offered valuable experience which helped land me a very competitive internship and graduate school at a ""prestigious"" institution; apparently it wasn't a ""real job"", though. Another person above said that a ""real job"" looks better on a resume, but I'm not sure how, for example, a vet school is going to gain anything out of you waiting tables for 2-3 years as opposed to working as student worker in an animal research lab. Employers would much rather see actual experience in your field.   Sure, you can spin it in the way of working under deadlines, etc, but it puts you at a disadvantage to others who have worked and gained experience in the field. Right now is a good time to gain those 2 years of experience that employers and graduate schools want to see. You have the rest of your life to be making good money. Just my $0.02.   tl;dr find a job giving you experience in your field; it will open doors. This won't be difficult at A&M since it has a huge ANSC department."

After that, everything snowballed from there. There is bound to be someone in ANSC that needs a student worker for a research project. Yeah, you'll probably have to shovel crap occasionally, but that's also part of the whole research process, too. I worked in plant breeding and I had to harvest by hand. Just part of the deal.  I know a lot of ANSC students work at the vet school, too. That would be an excellent opportunity, especially if you want to go to vet school. It shows that you're committed to the field while learning a lot outside of the classroom. Chances are you'll be working with graduate students and professors, which also helps expand your network.  The center is the O. D. Butler, Jr. Animal Science Complex. Once the semester starts, talk to all of the professors in your class. If they're not hiring, they'll probably know someone who does. I know most departments send out email newsletters with job opportunities, too."

As we work most with hip hop, from experience (because i've been here for about 4 years and have tried this thing) rappers/singers come in, lay vocals down, and they bring producers to engineer the songs for them. Now, obviously if the artist doesn't have a producer, they will be engineering the songs themselves.  If you take a look at other studios, they usually h ave an entertainment set up.  As for the instruments, It's more of a insurance against damage of property. With dozens of people coming in a week, heavy use is involved, so we encourage artist to rent/bring their own instruments. We do have 5 guitars, (3 acoustic, 2 electric)  and 4 amps, along with a alto saxophone and a drum mic kit for anyone to play drums.  But I love the feedback! I love listening to how other minds work and what they think, I hope at some point you come check it out because I always welcome other aggies like yourself. Thanks for expressing concern :)"

And they didn't have great new buildings like Emerging Technologies Building, Engineering Village, Giesecke, Engineering Education Complex, and the remodeled Engineering Innovation Center that have all come online during Banks' tenure.   And it's not like we have an engineering area campus master plan with several new buildings and two parking garages in the general vicinity of current lot 50.  Should Dr. Banks be on Twitter to be in touch with students?"

As far as I can tell, the master plan they have come up with will finally get our facilities up to snuff for the enrollment we already have. We'll see what else they come up with to accommodate even more students.   I graduated in 2012 and was on a student advisory board for Dr. Banks when they were initially developing the new expansion. I still remember having to camp out for 5 hours just to get a computer to work on my capstone project and then was told the next day during our meeting that there wasn't anything to worry about with regards to accommodating more students. It sounds like the only thing that she listened to was that we needed engineering parking garages.

When I was in school mine were pretty much all 3.5 GPA requirements.  You do get one semester on probation (at least) so even if your first semester you fall below it, you'll get at least a full year of the scholarship most likely.

Last I knew, in order to get the exemption for in state tuition from a scholarship, it must be a competitively awarded scholarship through your department. This can make it harder to get.   I got in state tuition by working for 6 months (maybe it was a year) and earning at least half of my income through my job. Talk to your advisers and the registrar. If you can show the registrar that you have earned 1/2 of your income in the great state if Texas (non university jobs) he can switch you over. I only went to school half time during this period to decrease the amount of money I would have needed to earn."

Double check with the ResLife and Parking websites to make sure of that. Which dorm are you moving into?

If the complex looks like it is in general disrepair or has deferred maintenance, stay away.   If it looks like it is in good condition, read your lease, document everything carefully, follow all rules, communicate in writing, and don't be whiny or arrogant when speaking with the management company.  From what I've seen on review sites, I'd say at least 1/3 issues stem from students not following the lease, 1/3 from students being a pain to deal with when speaking to the manager (or having daddy call), and 1/3 are genuine issues that would have been easier to resolve with more robust documentation.  If you go tour a property, stop someone in the parking lot who lives there and ask their opinion. There's less of a bias towards angry people who fill out online reviews, and you get a more current view of living there than a 3-5 year old review. Management may have changed for better or worse.

I took something nice but a bit out of my price range this year. I plan to move next year when I know the area better and can start my search earlier.  That being, a few come to mind. There's Country Place and Meadows Point. Meadows Point is kind of nice, but I didn't like the management and it seemed to ungrad-y. There's Quail Hollow also, but I thought it was pretty run down."
aggies,3dhnp1,webbed_feets,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:30:30 2015 UTC,"Treehouse apartments. They're by the Callaway house a block from campus, right in your price range (which is very low for even a studio btw). They're older but well maintained, and older floorplans tend to be larger anyway. The community is pretty low-key, grad students and small families. And it's on the last bus stop so it takes 7 minutes from your door to campus. Had less issues there in 2 years than I did in a semester at a 2 y.o complex."

That said...housing can be a bit of a bitch persay.   I recommend you looking at the apartments around Dartmouth, Harvey area. You might find some bad reviews, but overall they aren't too bad. You might also try looking in the Bryan area around Villamaria & 2818. The only problem with those is they aren't as easy to get to the campus. There's also some by Highway 6 and University, but getting to campus would be even worse bc it's rush hour and university is a main artery.   The only problem you'll really have is finding a ""cadillac""  1 bedroom at that price, you're probably going to have to settle for the less shiny Honda civics. But like I said, they generally aren't too bad and definitely do-able.   Another option is to look for roommates, which would make the cost a lot cheaper. And you might be able to find a 2 bedroom for 800$.   Let me know if you have any more questions!"

aggies,3dhnp1,TomBradysmom,2,Thu Jul 16 22:14:18 2015 UTC,"800-900 could get you a good/great one, I'd look at crescent pointe and around that area for apartments. You will definitely be away from almost all the college kids. Plus there's a 24 hour Kroger and Walmart fairly close by that you could also hit up for groceries and supplies since you said you keep weird hours. I think if you were willing to sign a longer term lease with them, you'd be able to get a lower price.   The only drawback I can see from that area is you're ~5 miles away from campus.   Edit: http://www.apartments.com/signature-park-apartment-homes-bryan-tx/g2brpmy/ Some place like that is what you would get.

Many outfits, especially ones that emphasize physical fitness ( most army outfits, H1, E2, Sq 17, Sq 2) will strongly encourage you to lift and work out on your own and extra protein is an important part of that. That being said, even coming from a very physical army outfit I know just as many people without protein as those that have it. Coming in as a fish you have a lot of things to worry about, but protein powder is definitely not one of them. Lemme know if you have any more questions!"

Also lifting isn't going to save you in a crap out, bodyweight strength will.  So if you're in an outfit that makes fitness a priority (H-1, K-2, C-2, E-2) I wouldn't worry about supplements (except maybe glutamine) for at least your first semester.  If you're in another outfit with other priorities, lift to your hearts content.  Water is the only supplement a fishy needs.  Hydrate."

I worked there full-time for a year and a half in the late 90s when it was UCS. It was all button down white shirts and ties back then, though I understand they've loosened that up (a bit). The owner is former IBM and military, and runs the place as such. You have to punch in your code everywhere you go so you can be checked on throughout the day. You're expected to clock in at least 5 minutes before 8 and not clock out earlier than 5:05. I found that out by written up once for my average clock-ins being 7:56--the reasoning was that I couldn't possibly be ready to work at 8.   You're strongly encouraged to eat at the company's cafeteria. The food isn't bad or expensive, just feel like lunch is my time.  I had an office, and had to keep my door closed all the time and was only allowed 3-4 personal items for adornment purposes. Back then it was only local intranet; nothing outside.  After 18 months I was fed up and moved on after an ill fated rant by my supervisor that resulted in three other guys quitting as well. I was hired with 8 other guys and I was the next to last to leave. There's still one guy who works for Rentsys that has hung on.

You'll constantly hear reminders from him to study, and his emails will contain a lot of advice on methods. The reason for that is because he teaches a freshman-level course, so he's making sure many of y'all stay on track. I didn't like his lectures, but that's because he tries to explain the concepts so much to the point that he over-complicates them. In fact, he'll tell you formulas aren't always to be taken as face value (which is true, but again, he just delves so far into the topic that it seems almost unneeded).   As far as being looked down on, probably not. Honestly, mechanics isn't all that important to a Computer Science major. The approval board probably only cares about your grades.  Good luck!

Unless you're in a class that has a lot of online quizzes and you can ctrl+F the book to find your answer, I'd recommend hard copy. Just easier to flip back and forth in my opinion. Make sure you even need to book first though, sometimes you don't. It's just personally preference. You'll have both at first and will probably just stick to one after."

That was for an openbook test tho, but ebooks do not convert to text conveniently in my experience. Honestly, I find real books easier on the eyes and to navigate than the digital ones. It just depends on if you love only carrying a tablet or laptop to class or enjoy writing notes with pen and paper. The more important question for any given class is if you need the text book in the first place."

I got into MEEN with a 3.2 but I also worked 16-20 hours per week and was in an organization. Look at the A&M entry to a major site. It has all the statistics and will give you an idea how hard it is to get into each major.

Living alone, I am pretty satisfied with a 45-50mbps connection (that is, bandwidth is never a limitation for my extended usage.)  That distinction aside, one large benefit to gigabit internet is sustained/peak download speed (and to a lesser extent lower ping if fiber optic). Not everywhere can serve files fast enough, but when they can, large downloads incredibly quick. With the 200mbps service I have now, yes, it's mostly wasted day to day, but when I need to download a new 20GB game from steam, its done in 15 minutes rather than 3 hours as it would be in your case.

aggies,3d6lnh,Qwoobie101,4,Tue Jul 14 00:15:09 2015 UTC,"I mean this is just me guessing from the little I know about your GPA and ACT scores. People with scores and grades around yours really need to have plenty of extracurriculars and leadership positions to solidify your chances of getting in, and joining a bunch of random clubs senior year isn't going to too much for your chances. Although all APs and Pre-APs does help as well. No one here is going to be able to tell you whether or not you'll get in--Admissions makes really weird and unpredictable decisions sometimes. Looking back on your post, my guess is that you'll definitely get some sort of admission. From the things I've heard about my friends who got in, your scores and experience resemble some of the people I know who got in through Gateway. But that's about all I can say for sure."
aggies,3d6lnh,megarooski,2,Tue Jul 14 00:45:14 2015 UTC,What's your rank? And what are you trying to major in? I was in top 10% and got a 29 composite with a 27 in math (I applied to Engineering) and got automatic acceptance.
aggies,3d6lnh,PokemonDoodler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:51:11 2015 UTC,I am thinking about Biomedical Engineering partially because it'll get me a decent a degree and help me finish premed without needing to take extra classes.
aggies,3d6lnh,Qwoobie101,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:13:55 2015 UTC,"Unless you REALLY like math and engineering, I would caution against majoring in Biomedical Engineering. As a premed, every B hurts you and every C hurts you really badly. In enginnering, there's a pretty strong chance you could end up with a GPA that just isn't competative for med school. However, if you can keep your GPA up, it will look extra impressive on your application. Additionally, you would have an alternate route to go with if you decided medical school wasn't for you or you just don't get in. So I'm not saying you absolutely shouldn't major I'm Biomedical Engineering, but you should definitely look over the pros and cons because it could really mess up your GPA and screw you over if you're not careful."

aggies,3d6lnh,SirNut,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:30:19 2015 UTC,Top 10% gives you automatic acceptance to the university; not necessarily the college you want. I know for engineering you needed to get like a 600 on math or a 27 for ACT.

I personally know a lot of people on Blinn Team, and many of them had better stats than you. I'm not saying this to scare you or anything, but I just want you to know what I've seen in my experiences. Also, we're missing one very important piece of information. What is your class rank? I would say your rank actually matters more than your raw GPA. If you're outside of the top 25%, I would definitely start looking at alternatives. Good luck though! And good on you for turning it around and getting serious about your education. Always remember that you can transfer in later if all else fails, just keep your grades up no matter where you end up going!"

I have friends that got accepted to ivies get rejected because they waited too long. You have a decent shot if you apply early.

I was accepted even with my low GPA because Blinn classes to do effect your TAMU GPA.  I will be getting my TAMU degree in December after a internship in the fall. My GPA will be about a 2.8   Now that you have heard my study know that you can come back from it.  Its not easy it takes hard work and dedication.

Also filed a complaint but that's another story.   I looked around and found a department in COALS that was something I was genuinely interested in and honestly, probably should have been in to begin with.  I showed up and pled my case. Guy didn't believe me. He knew I was on scholastic probation and he knew I was desperate. But he gave me a shot.    I dug out of the hole. Ended up with a 2.82 overall GPA (3.6 in my major). Not the greatest, but it worked. I got into grad school with a good GRE score and an explanation of the low gpa.  People's expectations of me were always low, and rightfully so. On paper I looked stupid. But you can turn it around. Be proactive. Go visit, in person, some departments and see about getting into them. Be genuine. Don't sugar coat it, they've seen a dozen kids like you already this summer. Don't blame anyone or anything else even if it was a factor (not saying you are, just a tip).

Patch me back through to him and as soon as he answered I told him he was an asshole to laugh at me like that and was unprofessional for hanging up on me. I had already taken OCHEM and qualitative Chem and made A's so it was clear my chemistry background was solid and if he had taken the time to get his head out of his ass he would have seen my other grades on my transcript. I told him I was aware it was was a long shot but being shot down in such a way was insulting and belittling. I asked where to direct a complaint and he mumbled something but I had longed stop listening.   I ended calling a dept on campus and they took my statement and said they would look into the matter. They never got back in touch with me though and I couldn't afford to dwell on it too much. I had to get my personal affairs in order or I was going to get kicked out of school entirely.   I wish there was some more justice/closure there though. Sorry.

aggies,3d1s8t,devondashla,-4,Mon Jul 13 04:47:00 2015 UTC,I've honestly never been there. This past spring semester I had a friend that went there once cause she had a virus on her computer and said they were gonna charge her $30 to remove it. I ended up removing it for her in 10 minutes for free. Charging that much for a simple virus removal is ridiculous.
aggies,3d1s8t,CrucioA7X,3,Mon Jul 13 05:51:26 2015 UTC,"They were probably charging for a pre-defined man-hour cost for virus removal.  They do have to pay their techs.  TAMU IT is cost-recovery.  Your student fees pay for a lot of your campus IT infrastructure, but it doesn't cover things like computer repair.  That $30 is bare-basic.  Compare that to $200 for Bestbuy to do it for you."
aggies,3d1s8t,the4thaggie,3,Mon Jul 13 15:10:23 2015 UTC,If you go to Best Buy they would probably charge $30 to tell you that you have a virus and an additional $100 to remove it.   An Apple Store would probably charge $100 for virus removal.

aggies,3d08oe,Q631FvrIC9AevYGZ9yjt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:35:05 2015 UTC,Pros:  1) Drive when you want  2) If you pull 8 hours on peak Friday / Saturday times you can easily make $150+  3) Most pax are friendly and fun to talk to  4) Very easy work if you can follow GPS directions and drive safely  Cons:  1) Potential of puke cleanup (haven't had one yet in 3 months)  2) Sometimes the fares don't come through steady and you have to figure out where the foot traffic is  3) Driving at night
aggies,3d08oe,TomBradysmom,2,Mon Jul 13 06:05:31 2015 UTC,"I want to add to the cons that some passengers will treat you like crap. They order the uber and you show up, they say they'll be down in 5 minutes. 15 minutes later, you're still waiting and they aren't answering. Happened to me several times. Several. Overall though still made bank"

The only class I had issues with was math151. Being that I was in the engineering nsc this wasn't really a surprise but even my backup was closed when I tried to get into that.

aggies,3cuoq8,Shoryukends,2,Sat Jul 11 01:42:05 2015 UTC,"I did not transfer from a community college. I transferred from a public school in Oklahoma.  That sounds like a pretty good plan, but I would recommend that you take a visit down and meet with and advisor after you apply. I think that really helped me to get in this time, as when I applied the third time my GPA was actually a 3.84. There were only 6 out of 400 applicants accepted this term and I don't believe fewer than 5 had a GPA higher than mine. It really helps to talk with the advisor and just let them know why you want to come to TAMU.   Yes it is very hard to maintain that GPA. My advise is if you can afford to do not overload yourself with more than 4 technical classes per semester. You will burnout halfway through, happened to me."

Many people that I know that struggled with the first accounting had a better time through this one.  If you feel like something is not clicking off the bat I'd go ask the prof/TA/tutor and have them walk it through with you until it does. The first test is more financial based, but after that it's more new ground and has way less steps than what you have typically seen in the past. Go over past tests and see what you got wrong - the final is comprehensive so just flipping through old tests every week helps keep the steps in your head. It is better than cramming them all at the end.  Practice everyday to keep it fresh in your mind, go over concepts again. You know that one question that takes you forever and is pretty tough? Force yourself through it, I'll guarantee you it'll probably be a test question."

LB is thin but the starters we have should make a good group going forward - Alaka (who I think is one of the most underrated defensive players in the entire SEC), Hilliard, and Walker. Our D-line should be sick this year with good to great starters and solid depth. I think we'll see some fresh faces at CB this year. Chavis likes his corners physical.   O-line is a concern because of the shuffled positions but the inclusion of Dave Christensen should help both the line and the run game. QB is not a concern, and Tra Carson and James White will make a good RB duo as long as the coaches utilize them properly in a well thought out run-game plan. WR is not a concern at all, and I think Moorehead has them playing a more physical game as well as running better routes."

I've gone five over in the little towns and the sheriffs just wave me on. I don't have a radar thing and I honestly don't think it's that big a deal but they're listing some pretty good ones here for you if you feel you need one.
aggies,3cjru2,Texasgal12,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"This person is lucky. College Station cops are especially prone to handing out speeding tickets (and there are a lot of cops in CS, if you haven't noticed yet, who have little to do but give out petty tickets for going 6mph over the speed limit or something).   Outside of CS, it's the little towns where you'll need to be especially cautious and outright not speed at all. If you're travelling on a large, multi-lane highway, you'll probably be fine, but I've personally been ticketed countless times speeding a few miles over the limit in the small towns outside of CS."

They will get set off by many things that aren't a cop's radar, like the automatic doors at a shopping center. You'll get beeped more times by false alarms than by an actual cop. By the time your fuzz buster beeps, the cop already has your speed. I mean the whole reason it goes off is because it picks up the radar signal, meaning you're in his range.  If you get pulled over with a radar detector, your chances of getting out with a warning just went to zero."

If the officer is just randomly speed checking or lasering, then it won't do much good. But most working highways leave it on and detectors get lit up pretty far away."

aggies,3cfnlb,archibaldworthington,3,Tue Jul 7 15:25:19 2015 UTC,"Hey! I've taken two of these. :)  CSCE 111 with Hurley-Show up to class(Attendance is 5% of your grade). The lectures are kinda boring but that's just the way it is. Hurley is a pretty funny and chill dude, though, so it makes up for it to some degree. Study his power points as they have pretty much all the information for the exams, though reading the chapters from the text book is still highly recommended, or even just skimming to get a good idea of the syntax and coding. The exams all have several grammatical errors and typos, which make them a nightmare to take sometimes, but he'll go back and correct them and give you back points, so it's fine. He grades on a curve based on how everybody else does in the class. For example, if you get a 70 on an exam and the class average is 70, that's not necessarily a C, scoring the average will often be (approximately) in the B range, though it's no guarantee until after the semester is done. Also, the labs and homework are not too difficult, just make sure to turn in your work in time, and that will help your grade too as it's 25% IIRC.   Follow this advice and you should get no lower than a B in this class.   STAT 211 with Hatfield- The prof is cool but gets side-tracked in lecture too easily, which can make the lectures hard to follow. When I took it, it was about 200+ people cramped in a not very spacious classroom in the chemistry building. The homework is not very time consuming and takes at most maybe a couple hours a week, but I don't think they prepare you for the exams very well, and the exams are kinda rough as it is only 20 multiple choice questions, so a few misses could cost you. I would recommend forming study groups for this class if you can. If not, study the old exams he gives you or try to find them from someone else.    I don't know what you can do to get a leg up besides maybe studying Java programming or Basic statistics on your own. There's  a lot of online sources available for both of them. Actually, that may help quite a bit if that's what you want to do.   Good luck!"

He will try to answer and spend half an hour doing so, and everyone will hate you for wasting their time with something that won't be on the exam  PRACTICE CODING DAMMIT. It will make reading slides and examples during class easier, and on the exam you will see code and basically have to compute and determine outputs from a blurb of code or troubleshoot it. Practice the flow output and know the functions.  Hatfield is a passionate professors, and has lots of anecdotes. He gets off topic a lot but he repeats important points over and over and over again.  Do the slides with him during class, do HW the problems BY HAND if you can (some of the HW data sets are a bit monstrous) There are so many practice materials and support materials. DO ALL OF THEM. There will be new questions or weirdly phrased questions that you will see on the exam, you will see patterns in the phrasing and identify what trips you up. Work on old exams WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE ANSWERS RIGHT AFTER YOU FINISH THE PROBLEM. You will not have the luxury of checking if your answer is right during the real exam.  You must treat old exams like practice exams. Study with no music in a quiet place as this will be you testing environment.    My best advice for any freshman reading this: Treat school like you would treat a job. You must commit yourself to but not all the time. Discipline and routine will get you through the semester. So set out a schedule AND STICK TO IT. Set out time that you will explicitly work on school work- no FB, no games, no unnecessary browsing, but also give yourself time to have fun, hang out, laze about, etc.  Don't make excuses to get your homework. Get it done as soon as possible. If you don't understand a concept, go get help ASAP, not the night before the quiz/exam. If you have a project due in a couple months, set deadlines and goals so you don't have to cram the week before it's due.   Thanks and Gig Em, and good luck!"

aggies,3ccxuu,EyeDoubtIt,3,Tue Jul 7 00:14:32 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend taking 151 because I took AP Calc in high school but we didn't do anything with vectors, which is the basis for Math 151.   Don't skip it."
aggies,3ccxuu,shstmo,5,Wed Jul 8 05:13:24 2015 UTC,"The general rule of thumb is re-take the highest level math course you can place out of in your first semester. In your case, retaking the course is not a bad idea. You won't regret padding your GPA in your freshman year, trust me. However, if you feel confident about jumping into Calc 2, go ahead and do that. This situation happens all the time and I've seen people happy on both sides of the decision. I retook the course when I could have placed out and don't regret it at all. Then again, I just graduated with a math degree so that really strong initial foundation to basic Calculus after taking it again really helped in the long run."
aggies,3ccxuu,feeltheillinoiseboys,6,Tue Jul 7 03:52:24 2015 UTC,"Since your in 151 your probably trying for some kind of STEM degree right? If so, take it again to be sure. However, if your not in a math intensive degree but just need one or two of the more basic classes, take the credit."

Since you got a 5 you clearly understood the subject, so ask yourself whether sitting through another year of what you already learned is worth the potential payout of maybe understanding more and having an easier time."
aggies,3ccxuu,Philaholic,4,Tue Jul 7 01:14:45 2015 UTC,"151 is not a year-long course. It's only a semester. And the curriculum contains quite a bit of material that is not listed on the syllabus for the AB exam. The BC exam is a much closer fit. I'll give you the same suggestions I gave OP. Check out some of the past common exams. Print a few out (there are three given out every semester). Sit down and work them, following the directions as given on the exam: http://www.math.tamu.edu/courses/math151/common-exams/  If you can do this without too much difficulty, then maybe you belong in 152."

I enroll in the course and become complacent and overconfident and end up missing a quiz or two and get a C in the class.  I learned from my mistake and exempted 152... and calc 3 wasn't any harder because of it.  My 2 cents.

I'm pretty sure you can also pay a small fee (like $10 or something like that) and move in a day early which is also much less crowded. I did that my freshman year because I did the second latest fish camp session and didn't want to drive back home to get my stuff after fish camp.   The actual move-in isn't the stressful part - it's finding parking close enough to your dorm so you don't have to carry whatever things you've brought over a long distance."
aggies,3c2qm0,aggielax7,7,Sat Jul 4 05:27:24 2015 UTC,"Agree with the parking!

The stress of parking and hauling shit lasts for a day (and even then there are a bunch of volunteers to help), the friendship with your roommate can minimize stress for the whole year.  Move in early, settle your shit with time and peace, explore a bit, then on move in day help your roommate and whomever you find attractive. You'll be one of the few with a leg up on everyone else."

aggies,3c2qm0,Assosiation,9,Sat Jul 4 13:06:46 2015 UTC,"1)To be honest, the whole move in week will result in a lot of people everywhere, and more traffic. 1 day after move in day won't make too much a difference because a lot of people will be doing the same thing. Either get there early in the morning, or later in the evening.  2)And as others have pointed out, if you can move in the day before, get there early and do that. The town isn't going anywhere and neither are its residents. It's coming up on the time of year when more and more people will be returning or moving here for the first time. I don't know where you're moving from but ""leaving the nest"" can be a culture shock. Bathe in it and make memories. But make good decisions. Cops in this town can be assholes so avoid doing something stupid, but don't fear having a good time.   3)Use your best judgement and enjoy your time most of all.

aggies,3c179f,hionpotenuse,4,Fri Jul 10 05:25:41 2015 UTC,It depends on your goals. If your really into lifting planet fitness won't cut it for you. The dumbells only go up to 60 lbs and they do not have any squat racks or typical bench presses. If you just want to do some cardio and light lifting it could fill your needs.   The planet fitness is brand new and everything is pretty nice though. They do not have a scale which is strange but it's for their no judgement atmosphere lol.  The golds in college station is one of my favorite gyms I've ever been to. If your serious about lifting they have pretty much everything you could ask for. It has a different atmosphere than the rec. Lots of roided out guys there. They have a ton of benches but the place can still get packed. Not as bad as the rec though.  Golds is $40 monthly and planet fitness is $10 for the basic membership.
aggies,3c179f,Assosiation,2,Sat Jul 4 00:21:18 2015 UTC,"This. And I love the atmosphere in the Gold's.

aggies,3bvx9b,therealjohnfreeman,6,Fri Jul 3 12:21:27 2015 UTC,"In high school he played at Exeter Township Senior High School in Pennsylvania.  There were 1,000 students in the school.  He probably played in front of a couple of hundred at any given game.  He also succeeded at camps and special events.  Then he came to A&M and kicked in front of 85,000 fans.  That's just a bit more pressure.  1) Tony Franklin was a pro-bowl kicker who graduated from A&M in '83.  This was before my time, but there is a great story about him.  The Aggies were in a big game and it came down to a last second field goal to win.  The opposing coach called a time out.  Instead of going to the sideline and waiting, he stood in the middle of Kyle field and called for the fans to cheer.  He got everyone yelling and it pumped him up ... and he drilled the field goal.   2) Word on the message boards is that he is actually doing extremely well on long-distance kicks.  Maybe LaCamera will get the extra points and chip shots, and Bertolet will go in for the 40+ yard kicks.  3) This is a unrelated, but now that Kyle Field is a bowl, why don't we ""saw"" when opposing kickers line up?  Can you imagine them trying to kick a field goal when everything in their sight is moving left and right?  It would have to be difficult on them."

It goes on to say that smoking and tobacco use are banned in all campus building except for sporting events where only smoking is banned.  Based on my interpretation:  dorm=okay, football game=okay, class=not okay  This is to be taken with a grain of salt though as I routinely see people dipping in campus buildings with no consequences, although it's more discrete then blowing clouds."

But usually classes aren't too long to be able to go a little while without some nicotine. If they vape for the sake of kicking the nic addition, then they'll usually have higher Mg of nicotine in their vapes when they are starting out.   My friend who started vaping to kick his addiction will usually vape on his way to class enough to hold him over until it ends. But a large portion of the battle is resisting that urge in slowly growing increments.   Glad you were able to kick it. Being addicted to it doesn't seem like any fun at all."

aggies,3bslbi,Forward-Looking,2,Wed Jul 1 20:27:13 2015 UTC,"I took Zhou last semester and he was pretty good. I wouldn't say he's the best teacher of the material necessarily, but I like the way he structures the class. In other words, he gives good examples, but he could use some work on explaining why things work the way that they do.  The class format is what I liked though. He's a proponent of sitting and absorbing information as opposed to taking notes on everything and not really understanding what's going on, so he encourages you to not take notes. Rather, he puts all of his class notes online, so you can access them later at any time and also follow along with them as you go through class, assuming you have it in a computer lab.   Also, his grading system is nice. Basically, there's homework, three exams, and a final. All of the homework is graded, but the answers to the problems he assigns are in the back of the book, so you shouldn't have a problem getting good grades there. As for the exams, they're not too hard, but the kicker is that he allows you a full front and back formula sheet that you make yourself. This is kind of a big deal cause not all professors do this.  He also does something cool for your final grade in the class, giving you two options: either take the final exam and implement all other assignments in your final grade for the class, or skip the final exam and simply use the average of your three regular exams as your final grade.  So like I said, he might not be the best teacher of the material (that could just be my opinion), but the way he structures the class is worth it if you ask me."

I loved how much he genuinely enjoyed the subject but using Maple was always a pain in the ass and a lot of his teaching was pretty unhelpful. I wound up going to A+ for each exam and got an A in the class, so I will say that's a somewhat winning formula. He's a cool, intelligent guy...but just maybe not the greatest prof yet  also, if you do 311 with Battle its totally manageable. I went to maybe 3 of his lectures all semester, studied too little and I think I got an A. Really wasn't too overbearing imo"

If you do your homework and study, you'll be fine.   I took that and 323(Linear algebra for math majors) at the same time. 323 was kinda rough. The difficulty is about the same as 311, I would believe.   Taking both at the same time should be fine depending on what other classes you're taking.

aggies,3bslbi,nawkuh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"In that case, I'd recommend switching to POLS and get that out of the way. You don't need to be taking all technical classes your first full semester at the school if you're transferring from Blinn team. Give yourself time to acclimate fully to the new environment. So just replace 311 with POLS if you can and that should be a reasonable schedule your first semester here."

aggies,3bpshn,Aslan15,13,Wed Jul 1 04:19:19 2015 UTC,"Go with the lowest number of meals, and the highest number of dining dollars. The meals/meal trades are very limiting and meal trades don't make financial sense. You trade a dining hall meal you paid $9 for originally for a chik-fil-a meal that costs ~$7. However, the dining dollars can be used for anything in chartwells restaurants/stores and their spending value matches what you paid for them. Of course you can always just pay out of pocket for that stuff since it's the same price with dining dollars or with cash, but for me it was easier to be able to pay with my student ID, and I felt less guilty spending dining dollars instead of cash on overpriced coffee.  Bonus tips: When not using a meal trade, always just get water instead of soda. The MSC Starbucks/convenience store does not take dining dollars, and neither do the concession stands at football games since they are not affiliated with Chartwells."
aggies,3bpshn,LifetimeAggieGal,3,Wed Jul 1 05:07:39 2015 UTC,"This seems like the best option. Also, use your actual meals at the dining halls for lunch/dinner when it's more expensive, use dining dollars for dining hall breakfast and the restaurants/stores. (you can buy some medicines, school supplies and hygiene products at the Aggie Express too, it's overpriced as heck but great in a pinch) And don't forget to make friends, chances are by the end of the year they will be glad to spend their excess dining dollars with you."

The other part of it was that you didn't have to use a meal plan for Duncan Dining hall for lunch, so you ended up with a ton of extra meals at the end of the semester. In 2006 I had about 40 extra meals at 9 bucks apiece and you better believe I cleaned out the C store. Gatorades, cheeze its, snacks.

No one is going to stop you from using the library, but you won't be able to check anything out/use computers to print or anything since you need a TAMU UIN (student ID) number. And I believe you can pay for a guest membership to the gym, but in that case, pay for something off campus because the rec is overly crowded anyway, and if you're going to pay, go somewhere where it doesn't take 20 minutes to wait for a rack to open up."

aggies,3bj3jo,turkishguy,0,Mon Jun 29 20:50:01 2015 UTC,Your classes your first two years are all basic lower level classes anyways for the most part. So why not give more students the opportunity to receieve an A&M engineering degree? This seems extremely beneficial to students who wouldn't be financially able to attend A&M all four years.
aggies,3bj3jo,mcfly2,11,Mon Jun 29 21:04:28 2015 UTC,Not all your classes in your first two years are basic lower level classes.   Unless you think Thermodynamics or Differential Equations are lower level classes.
aggies,3bj3jo,turkishguy,3,Mon Jun 29 21:05:40 2015 UTC,"That's why I said for the most part. If a COE professor is going to go teach courses at these colleges, then it's probably a safe bet to say they'll be teaching those tougher classes."
aggies,3bj3jo,mcfly2,6,Mon Jun 29 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"I mean I just don't get it. If you can't afford to go to A&M that's fine. I could hardly afford to go here but thanks to grants and scholarships I was able to. What I don't understand is why A&M is merging with Chevron and more community colleges and watering down what is already a diluted engineering program. What benefit does it serve the school or students when kids are taking classes at HCC but are labeled ""A&M students""? What's the difference between that and just going to HCC then transferring to A&M?"
aggies,3bj3jo,turkishguy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:53:44 2015 UTC,"As has been mentioned earlier, it makes sure that anybody coming from places like HCC or El Centro in Dallas will be able to seamlessly integrate into the classes in college station. As for the reasoning, there is both a growing need for engineers and a growing number of students in Texas and A&M is perfectly situated to tackle both of those issues. If it wasn't for the $5 million from Chevron than A&M wouldn't have the budget for this and it seems like both sides want there to be more Aggie engineers.   I'm not saying this is perfect but I think it's the best thing that A&M can do. After all, we go to a land-grant school and making sure there are enough engineers is part of the reason A&M was established."

Edit:  Left out a word, and made the complete opposite point.... Oops."
aggies,3bj3jo,AgAero,-2,Tue Jun 30 07:55:46 2015 UTC,There's absolutely no way that any class at a community college will be as mentally challenging and difficult to manage in regards to time with a course taught at A&M. You may have learned similar stuff and maybe even gone more in depth but there's no way it's as difficult. There's a reason why kids who fail calc/chem/physics go take it a community college so they can get the grades to keep moving forward in their respective programs.
aggies,3bj3jo,turkishguy,2,Tue Jun 30 13:21:48 2015 UTC,"Why do you think that?  Are you saying teachers of first year classes are terrible at A&M?  Class sizes too large?  People I knew who took cal 2 at Blinn and A&M both found it harder at Blinn actually.  They still passed, but that was because they had now seen the material more than once and tried a little harder."
aggies,3bj3jo,AgAero,2,Tue Jun 30 13:54:55 2015 UTC,From taking physics at both A&M and a community college the coursework is just more demanding. The homework is more difficult and the tests are MUCH more challenging.
aggies,3bj3jo,turkishguy,2,Tue Jun 30 14:06:05 2015 UTC,"You are comparing Blinn to every other CC. Blinn because it has such close ties to A&M is going to make there classes generally consistent, since most Blinn students have aspirations to go to A&M. The kids at these other CC do not have that desire.   I took Cal 3 the summer at a CC before coming to A&M. The first month and a half of the class was re-teaching Cal 2 because 3/4 of the class didn't have the Cal 2 basics.   This is nothing more than creating a degree mill for engineering, so that those engineering students can get there 100k a year jobs and start donating back to the university."

aggies,3bj3jo,AgAero,0,Tue Jun 30 16:40:04 2015 UTC,"Calculus and physics don't change from institution to institution. Sure the classes may not be as hard there as they would be on campus, but this program seems like it's going to give an opportunity to kids who otherwise would not be able to attend A&M. The brunt of their engineering coursework will still be on campus.  And if your case against this is classes at different institutions are easier then students shouldn't be allowed to take their calcs, chems, or physics classes anywhere except A&M. A lot of people already take those classes at different institutions as it is now. So again, I'm confused what all the fuss is about?"
aggies,3bj3jo,mcfly2,6,Mon Jun 29 21:45:16 2015 UTC,I just replied to another one of your comments but the fuss is that A&M students generally can't take all those classes elsewhere. If you did it's because you transferred in. I can't think of any situation where an A&M student who didn't transfer in took the majority of their basic classes at a community college.
aggies,3bj3jo,turkishguy,-3,Mon Jun 29 21:56:04 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great thing to encourage students to study engineering.  Also, this will be huge with the 25 by 25 initiative, as this will count towards enrollment numbers without having them on the CS campus their first two years."

I'll wager you don't actually need an engineering degree for this most of the time, and industry wants to flood the market with candidates so they can pay you less.  Show me engineering graduates making $100,000+ within 3-4 years of graduating, and I'll believe in this 'need' for engineers.

And yes, I'm a chemical engineering major taking thermo this summer. There is absolutely nothing wrong with expanding the engineering program to accommodate a wide variety of technical and engineering education needs, and the fact that more people are being given the opportunity to get a top notch education does not cheapen your own.

It is fine to expand as long as you are not increasing the number of overall students in the engineering dept. But when you expand and increase the number of students you will inevitably get less qualified students inside the program. Look at it this way when you get assigned your Plant Design project at the end of your A&M career and have to pick a team to work with. Would you rather have a pool of fellow classmates that have had the same classes taught with the same curriculum as you did, or would you rather have a 1/4 of those students taking classes that were taught by inferior professors with an inferior curriculum."

TAMU is already rejecting a lot of well-qualified students already because of lack of space, and those students end up attending out-of-state schools and generally to companies in that part of the country after they graduate, and thus not coming back and working in Texas and helping stimulate its economy."

I learned the same things there that I would have if I'd had the classes at A&M, only my tuition would be vastly more expensive and I'd probably have encountered more weed out classes.  But I guess I had inferior instruction. I'd better drop out now and save my classmates from having to potentially be teamed up with me later on."

aggies,3bg6aw,CS9215,7,Sun Jun 28 23:23:09 2015 UTC,Yea I'm inclined to agree.... Pretty sure as a physics major 151 will be the one you need regardless.   I'd check with your academic advisor/go to your department's website and look for the course catalog for your major

aggies,3bg6aw,thefarcus,8,Fri Jul 3 04:44:47 2015 UTC,"I just ran through it real quick and, even with a score of 33/33, it still suggests taking 151. So I think the idea here is that it is saying you are ""calculus ready"".  Physics majors generally take 171. It covers everything seen in 151 and more. Definitions, theorems, and concepts are emphasized in much greater detail than 151, and your exams will cover more material. However, there are no matlab assignments like in 151, so you also have more time to focus on the ideas.   I see that Roger Smith is teaching 171 this fall. He would be a great choice."

aggies,3bg6aw,thedjbj,6,Mon Jun 29 00:38:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a physics major, and I'm going to advise you to take 171. When I was signing up for classes for my first semester, I had the same thought process that a lot of the other people in this thread had: that proofs are scary and that I should take 151 because it would be easier. The next semester, I decided that I should do the whole ""physics major thing"" properly, and so I took 172. I liked 172 much more than I did 151. The class was significantly smaller and I thought the professor was much better. The proofs ended up not being that bad anyway."
aggies,3bg6aw,HungLikeSaddam69,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:44:12 2015 UTC,What sort of proofs are involved in that course?  Is it mostly delta-epsilon stuff?  I did not get my calculus credits from A&M so I don't know much about the courses here.

aggies,3bg6aw,pestydestroyer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:40:04 2015 UTC,Taylor and Maclaurin series are my favorite part of that class.  I'm sad that mine didn't cover it as well in college as my highschool teacher did.    When you took cal 3(Math 221?) did they go into any matrix calculus or basic differential geometry stuff?

aggies,3bg6aw,devondashla,2,Tue Jul 7 06:49:16 2015 UTC,"What I sort of mean:  Matrix Calculus - Did you ever have to take the gradient of a vector?  This operation is valid, but it wasn't touched on in my class.  It produces a matrix actually.  By differential geometry, I'm expecting some formalisms about curvilinear coordinate systems.  For instance, when you take the gradient of a field in cylindrical coordinates, why does it look so different from what it does in cartesian?  Or, when you have a trajectory with an intrinsic frame attached to it(tangent, normal, and binormal), what other characteristics does it have(torsion, curvature, etc.)?"
aggies,3bg6aw,AgAero,2,Tue Jul 7 07:19:35 2015 UTC,"Math major here who took 152 and then 221:  Math 171 and 172 will prepare you much better for your more advanced math and physics classes. 151 will just waste your time with MatLab and not teach you what you need to learn about proofs or how math is used in the context of formal Mathematics or Physics. The MPE is just a recommendation, you don't have to adhere to what it recommends. But take it again just to solidify your score so that your advisor at your NSC is okay with you taking 171.  I was completely lost in 221 after taking 152 because I didn't have the proofs background."
aggies,3bg6aw,devondashla,2,Mon Jun 29 03:37:51 2015 UTC,"Fellow physics major here, I took 171 my freshman year and it wasnt that bad. The proofs arent too dificult and it will get you used to seeing math in a more general way. I recommend you take it because your classes are just going to get more difficult down the line. Once you reach phys 331 you'd wish you could go back to 171, 172 and 221 haha   That aside, the class is smaller, there is usually a curve and your classmates are math and physics majors as well."
aggies,3bg6aw,minicoz,2,Fri Jul 3 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter. They're about the same difficulty. If you're a physics major however, you'll enjoy Math 171 more. I was a math major. I took 151 first semester and 172(Calculus 2 for Math/Science majors) the next. 172 was more enjoyable because the class was WAYYY smaller. The exams are less annoying too since they're not the common exams. I also didn't like Matlab, but programming isn't my biggest forte(though it does help later down the road). Both of these classes were in the honors section but I don't see how the regular sections are that much different.   Sorry I'm answering your question 8 days late, haha."
aggies,3bg6aw,feeltheillinoiseboys,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:46:25 2015 UTC,"MATH 151 is basically the standard Calculus 1 class, whereas MATH 171 is the Calculus 1 class for math majors and is somewhat recommended for science majors. MATH 151 is just a practical class where you learn how to do basic calculus. MATH 171 is a proof-based class, going in more depth into how everything works.  I've taken both, and I honestly would recommend 151 unless you feel comfortable with proofs and are interested in the inner mathematics on HOW calculus topics work. 171 is recommended for science majors to get you into the theory mindset, as you'll be dealing with a lot of theory in the later science courses."

In years before I could probably be more help, but unfortunately this year they have completely changed the structure of rush on our campus to eliminate ""dirty rush"", or the basically the party part of rush. So now it is all dry events in one week. Sign up on IFC to try and get in contact for summer rush events, try to let a few fraternities know when your NSC is to try and meet up with them too. Again, I'm not exactly sure how actual rush is working this year other than that week of dry rush but I'm sure that is mandatory.  As far as FLOs go, they are fun but they are very different from fraternities or at least my fraternity experience at this school. Most fraternities' pledgeships will be somewhat costly and will require some amount of work (I only mention this because you said you dont know anything about fraternities). I would recommed trying to meet some greek students during the summer, go out to rush, be yourself and see if you think you could handle the experience. If not, then a FLO is probably a better fit. I can say that as someone who has been with a fraternity since his first semester, (and is also a first generation aggie/ college student) I could not imagine my college life without a fraternity. Hope this helps, feel free to ask me more."

aggies,3b8o2j,diablodow,6,Fri Jun 26 23:32:36 2015 UTC,"I'm an incoming grad student so I don't know the details of how A&M does it but I was fairly involved in the rush process at my undergraduate institution.   The biggest point you asked about is ""finding the right brotherhood for you"". I like to use the car example for this. When you went to a party or event in highschool you had friends you met there and friends you rode there with. Look for a  house with the guys you would ride to that event with. You shouldn't worry about what tier people claim to be. Just go look for the people you get along with and the rest will take care of itself. These are the people you will bond with and have the best time with. If you want to PM more specific questions then go for it."
aggies,3b8o2j,dexterbateman,9,Fri Jun 26 22:33:14 2015 UTC,"The thing about A&M is that Greek life is still very young. Mist chapters at schools like t.u. were started in the 20's, whereas the chapters here have only been around since the early 80's. So its not super prevalent.   With that said I for one have loved my Greek experience so far. Im in a chapter here and would be more than happy to answer any and all questions you may have. Feel free to shoot me a PM and Ill make sure you get an invite to my chapters rush events.   Most of rush has been changed in an effort to eliminate ""dirty rush"", so its not gonna be what I went though. Like I said, Id be more than happy to answer any questions you may have about rush, pledgeship, or just Greek Life in general."
aggies,3b8o2j,GameDay98,5,Fri Jun 26 23:53:31 2015 UTC,"Like Lil was saying, rush based on the group of people you like the most. The quality of a fraternity chapter is mainly based on its members.

aggies,3b91vv,buzz3light,6,Fri Jun 26 23:31:01 2015 UTC,"I was previously a Blinn Team student for a year. I applied for early transfer to electrical engineering for Fall 2015, and I found out at the beginning of this month that I was accepted into Texas A&M full time for EE.   I took most of my more difficult classes (maths and sciences) at Blinn while fulfilling my core curriculum classes at A&M. It's pretty nice. While it is true that some classes are easier at Blinn, others are definitely not. I learned that in Physics at Blinn.  The TEAM advisors are pretty helpful at making sure you stay on track for you to reach your desired goal of transferring full-time to Texas A&M with the major you want. You just have to be sure you also talk to the advisors of the department you are interested in, but DO NOT talk to Blinn advisors. Only meet with advisors at A&M since they know what the university looks for.  Biomedical and mechanical engineering are different though. The two are a lot more competitive to get into compared to electrical engineering. Take a look at the ""Entry-to-a-Major"" statistics for this past year and you'll see for yourself: https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/advisors-procedures/entry-to-a-major/resources/analysis-spring-2015-admission-cycle  Also, make sure to look at the Transfer Course Sheets for your desired majors. http://admissions.tamu.edu/transfer/majors This is pretty much what you need to have in order to be even considered. However, I do not know anyone personally who was able to get in into either from Blinn Team.    You have to work really, really, really hard to get into Mechanical and Biomedical, but if you really have the desire to get to A&M full-time, I think can definitely do it.  Hopefully this helped!"

I look at activities this way: This is the only time you will ever get a chance to go. It isn't super expensive or super time intensive (you would probably spend those 3 days just goofing around if you weren't going anyway). In college, there will be many opportunities that you get, and if you're too nervous or ""too cool"" to do it, you may never get a chance to do it again. I see fish camp as the first way to go to college and being open to new ideas and activities. Sure you may not like it, but you did it, have the experience, and can move on. If you don't want to go because it's new or different, then college will be tough."

Get Involved. I'm a pretty big introvert who was reasonably shy coming to college, and I was never really big on talking to people that I didn't need to talk to. But getting involved in a campus organization was one of the best things I could have done. It not only connects you with people who have similar interests, but it will provide you with a circle of friends to do stuff with on a regular basis. I came to college knowing probably 15 people here, and going into my junior year, I'm on a first name basis with about 200 because of the connections I've made through the organizations I've joined. Find people you care about, and the good times will follow naturally. This is another thing I learned at Fish Camp, but it's something I always remind myself of in moments when I'm deciding to do something or not. When you look back on your time in college, you'll only remember the times you actually went out, took risks, and did stuff. (As opposed to staying behind cause you're ""tired"" or ""need to catch up on homework"".) Being an introvert, it's very easy for me to want to take a break from plans with friends and just chill on my own, but once it's all said and done, 99% of the time, you'll be more satisfied having gone out on that spontaneous midnight run to Fuego followed by Smash Bros. at a friend's house. Don't get me wrong, school is important, but you'll always be able to set time aside to study if you don't goof off on your alone time. Dorm life is for some people, apartment life is for some people, and house life is for some people, but one thing stands: Figure out your roommates and living situation for next year ASAP. It's easy to keep putting off this decision as you don't want to set anything in stone, but if get into the swing of things early, you'll have a much better range of options. (Houses are the best IMO. They're spacious, low stress, and a lot better for having people over.) This one's kind of a corollary of 3. Figure out what you're gonna be doing for the summer ASAP. It's not unusual for you to have this decision made before the end of the fall semester. A lot of summer camps come to town around that time, and they'll be looking for counselors which is always a popular choice. Same can go with internships, but I wouldn't worry about them until you finish your sophomore or junior year. It's unusual for freshmen to land internships, but it does happen. Don't stress if you don't know what you're doing with your life. I'd probably put the ratio at 1:1:1 of people who know what they want to do, people who kind of know what they want to do but aren't sure, and people who have no idea where they're headed. This one is a little bit out of my reach of expertise, cause I never really took it myself, but a lot of people will tell you it's great advice. Get to know your professors by going to their office hours and talking to them around class. Having a rapport with them will serve you well not only as a grade bargaining tool, but also as a means of networking.   I could probably go on forever with advice, but I'll leave it at this for now. Hope it helps!"

aggies,3b5j7a,MathTeacher07,7,Fri Jun 26 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"Academics   Even in the largest of classes, your professors will notice your absence. Those who actively participate and show interest in the class are more likely to catch a break (ie extra-credit, rounding, etc) Professors are humans too, and many are there to do research; not teach.  They teach because it is their job to.  Make their life easier, and you'll probably find they make yours too. Always assume that all of the material will be on the test.  Asking that question to the lecturer demonstrates laziness and may even encourage them TO put it on the test.   Social   Whatever you were in highschool in the popularity ladder means precisely dick at college. Greek Life is not all drunken booze fests, and they are a good way to meet lifelong friends and make connections.  Make a small group of comrades in your major.  You are more likely to succeed if you collaborate.   Continuity of Operations   Arrests, even outside the university, have the potential to affect your ability to attend the university. There is no ""Principal's Office"".  Only the honor council, and you are generally never going to be found ""innocent"".  Most punishments involve suspension (semester at least) or expulsion.  You do NOT want to find yourself there.     Traffic   Learn traffic patterns and rush hours.  Try to avoid them if at all possible. It's usually faster to take the backroads then it is the main ones:  Texas, University, George Bush and Welbourne Riding a motorcycle in this city can be a harrowing and deadly experience.  Traffic is saturated by new drivers.   Food and Weight Gain   There are many choices for food, but most are not healthy.  Stock up on fresh food where you can. HEB on Texas is packed during the weekend but is (or was) 24hr.  Time your grocery shopping accordingly.  Alternatively, drive down Texas into Bryan, and you will hit Bryan's more accessible HEB. Stress, irregularity of eating, fast food, and lack of exercise will cause you to gain a ton of weight.  Pay attention to not only what you eat but how much and how often you do."
aggies,3b5j7a,emofes,7,Fri Jun 26 15:35:39 2015 UTC,"Here's my own piece of advise: Do not be afraid of changing your mind about your future or your plans. Changing your major is a scary process when you're trying to figure out what you want to study, especially if you came into school with one major and then quickly realize you want to study something else, like I did. There is a process to it and in the end you will end up somewhere that you feel more comfortable in.  EDIT: Also, I just thought about this. Resist the urge to sleep in too much on the weekends. My roommate and I were terrible about sleeping in; some of my Saturdays and Sundays didn't actually start until 1:00 of 2:00 PM. Try to set a relaxed, but reasonable, schedule for yourself on weekends so that you don't waste the entire day doing nothing. Set a reasonable time for you to wake up that still lets you sleep the school week away."

aggies,3b5j7a,Wild__Card__Bitches,3,Fri Jun 26 05:02:06 2015 UTC,"Don't slack off for the first week of school because you're ""just getting into a routine"" or trying to figure things out, the first tests are on the third or fourth week (depending on your prof) and they will sneak up on you. Enjoy your first few weeks on campus, but put a couple of hours towards studying every day and by the time tests come, you will be 500% less stressed out and much more prepared. The best thing you can do for yourself is establish study skills immediately, especially if you didn't have to in high school."
aggies,3b5j7a,pvtpaco,3,Fri Jun 26 05:04:41 2015 UTC,"Late to the party and most of the stuff I was going to say has been said, but...  Get to know someone in every class on a first-name basis. Preferably more than one someone. Sit next to each other. Share notes. Study together. Help with assignments (if allowed). Preferably, if the class has lots of work involved, set up designated work times and don't let each other skip."

aggies,3b5j7a,catsrule362,4,Sat Jun 27 02:42:57 2015 UTC,"1: Don't say ""yes"" to everything  If you do, you'll end up with a bunch of commitments that you half-ass, instead of full-assing a few of them. Don't feel bad that you have to say ""no"" sometimes. Trust me, people won't get hurt.  2: Get involved in SOMETHING  Join an intramural basketball team at the rec. Join a group for your major. Find people who have a group for some random-ass thing you like to do (trust me, they exist). Whatever you do, don't just sit around doing nothing. In high school, you made friends by being in the same classes and liking the same stuff. Now you're in a much larger school where you might talk to a few people from class who may or may not be similar to you in any way. Joining a group of some kind guarantees you have at least something in common.  3: Ask for help when you need it  Don't be afraid to ask your professors for help during office hours, or to ask anyone for help with anything, for that matter. I'm talking about academic help, emotional help, medical help, really anything. Services for everything you can imagine exist on campus and you're paying for them whether you use them or not.   4: Take school seriously  While a large part of how you change at college is academic, there is also a social aspect to it. You really find your people at college. You'll want to spend so much time with them just having great adventures, and that's fun and all, but don't forget that your education is just as important. Finish your work promptly, then go have fun. Learn how you thrive academically and create an environment where you can do so. It took me a while to figure myself out both socially and academically, but when I did, it paid off in spades.   5: Embrace tradition  Texas A&M is a lot more fun if you participate in our time-honored traditions. They've existed for a long time for a reason; don't be a 2%'er! Putting a penny on Sully definitely gives you a letter grade boosts on tests, by the way. It's just science."

Get out there and try new things/experiences... but be smart about it! Don't neglect your school work Know where you're going to school: This is Texas A&M. We have a long and storied story. Add to it, don't besmirtch (spelling?) it Be involved in some sort of group  Escort a fish to their dorm! They'll appreciate it and you'll get a new friend. (That is if fish still have to worry about the craziness that is the Quad haha) Do everything in Thirds (this one I will explain). Best advice I got from my Dad when I left for college was the above: 1/3 time for studies  1/3 time for social things 1/3 time for Corps/other activities    Basically have a balance in your life, so as to not burn yourself out in one area.  Don't always be studying because you'll crash and burn in classes (unless that's your thing) and you'll miss out on great organizations and meeting people.   Don't always party because your grades will suffer and in turn you can't participate in all the groups you may want to.  Don't join everything because you'll be too busy to study and go out.  Break it up how you want to in terms of fraction, but overall just don't do too much of one thing!  -Ag of '12"

aggies,3b4hfr,who_is_bobby_wagner,2,Thu Jun 25 22:06:59 2015 UTC,"FBI is getting better, but I didn't really learn anything from it. However, Musoma is an AMAZING speaker and is worth your time to see him talk + that class is an easy A. (BTW, if it's not your thing - don't sit in the front row or at the edge of the isles as sometimes he likes ask kids to be his examples in class for fun!)  The rest of your classes won't be at Mays though (unless you came in with a ton of AP/Dual... though you might take an ISYS class which is just learning how excel/access/html works and only has 1 prof teaching last time I checked). The MATH classes are the ones people usually struggle with during the fish year, but the profs keep changing so there's not a ""good one"". Look at myEDU and Koofers for the best reviews by searching the course and the profs name. If none of them have great reviews, go with ""TBD"" prof because in my experience those tend to be relatively new and younger teachers that end up being nicer and the class a tiny bit easier (my TBD Business Calc 1 prof gave us lots of sympathy points for tests when the class average was poor, then made the 2nd test too easy where the avg was a high B... and still curved the class at the end).  Take some gen. eds to get them out of the way. The nice thing about going to a big school is that you can select from a list and find one that sounds interesting. If you have any more specfic classes in mind, feel free to ask."

aggies,3b4hfr,CakedayIsBirthday,2,Fri Jun 26 01:10:01 2015 UTC,"Mays doesn't require a language (unless you're going with an international business major). The science class depends - biology is typically safe but Mays isn't really picky on Science AP credits so you'll probably get 1 of 2 required science classes out of the way. Though one of the science credits needs a lab class with it (1 credit class where you do experiments related to the 3 credit lecture), so I'm not 100% sure but I'm guessing you'll have to sign up for one of the science courses with a lab. Your math AP depends. Business Math 1 is pre-cal, Business Math 2 is calc 1. (If your AP was not calc, you're probably not getting any credit.) Ask your advisor at your NSC which one your AP covered before registering.  If I remember correctly, there are 2 required English courses, so you still may have to take one but those classes are pretty easy.   Here is Mays' course catalog: http://maysweb.tamu.edu/maysnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/formidable/2014-2015Handbook-online.pdf  They hand students the exact same handbook every year at NSC. Start at page 16, and look at any major's first 2 years (2nd 2 years are usually more major specific but all business students have common business core classes to take) to get a feel of the type of classes you'll be dealing with each semester."
