Or would this push Pacific colonization back to earlier dates and give evidence that Australasians used to dominate the area before being pushed out by Polynesians and other groups?
Anthropology,3e3q1p,themoxn,0,Tue Jul 21 19:45:10 2015 UTC,"Did you mean Austronesian in Madagascar?  Austronesian is the Malay-polynesian group,  and is very different from Australian.  Or please provide a source for Australian migration to Madagascar.  ""Australasian"" is Australia and New Zealand, and that migration was in the European era.  *Edit. I see the original article uses the term Australasian too. Is that a mistake by ScienceDaily? Or do anthropologists really use this modern geographical term to mean Australians?"

Even just within South America, it is not very productive to talk about perspectivism as feature of 'South American Culture' any more than we can talk about monolithic 'European Culture' (e.g. Praet 2005 applies a perspectivist analysis to the Chachis, a group from the Pacific, but it just does not seem to be the same thing Viveiros de Castro is talking about). Just google 'perspectivism' and you will find all kinds of things, some cool, and some silly (I found Lind 2015 claiming that  Chinese people are perspectivists too now). While the concept is an insight into some peoples of South America, I don't think it has scaled up very well. But check out how people apply it and maybe you will think differently."

I had originally seen it quite young and loved it, but my god my friends thought it was absolutely terrible. I had to turn it off because no one could even stand it! Arguably, modern comedy can also be ""stupid"" and slapstick. Its evident in television as well. ""It’s not just the subject matter of sitcoms that’s changed. 30 Rock and Arrested Development reformatted the sitcom, switching to a single-camera setup and bombarding the audience with nonstop jokes, pop-culture references and visual gags. Once you’ve spent hours re-watching Arrested Development and picking out new jokes on each viewing, the setup/punchline structure of Cheers, Friends and even Seinfeld starts to feel predictable.

Anthropology,3du72v,Mictlantecuhtli,5,Sun Jul 19 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"Obviously, what this person experienced is awful. I do think it is a bit unfair to take one experience and hold it up as a pattern, though.   First, I entirely agree with the author that there are racist anthropologists. Just as there are racist everythings. A professor emeritus at my MA program used to do the whole look at me with a topless black native! thing all the time. When he was away on sabbatical the I'm out of the office sign on his door was even him arm around such a person. It was uncomfortable and problematic and inappropriate. Though obviously not as overtly racist as what the author relates. I agree that sometimes older generations who don't focus on race in their research can be outdated and problematic in the ways they approach the subject.  However, I've encountered way more white anthropologists who are nuanced in their discussion and presentation of race. I've attended talks about race at the AAAs where speakers were white but let their informants voices be heard and didn't invalidate their experiences. And this isn't just cultural anthropologists. Matt Cartmill, a fairly well known older biological anthropologist, gives a wonderful talk about how race is a cultural construction. I think some anthropologists do have problems with race but I haven't seen it as a majority problem.  Second, the issue of stolen material is definitely an issue. I don't know if the larger pattern is about race so much as taking advantage of graduate students. The personal examples I know of are white grad students who had some or all of their research taken by white professors. But something I do sometimes see is using young scholars from minority demographics as a token authorship. Writing about women? Better get a female grad student to write a sentence so it looks like we involved women's voices. Writing about Hispanic populations? Quick isn't our new grad student Colombian American? Etc. Involving minority voices should mean actually giving them space and respect. Lots do, of course, but we should call out those that don't.  All of this being said, I do think it is important for anthropologists to think about these issues critically. We don't get to just say we aren't racist because we're anthropologists. Being reflexive shouldn't just be about our own field site. Especially if we want to teach about a subject we need to be honest about our own biases and experiences. And we need to seek out those voices from the communities we teach about and really listen to them. (Though that doesn't mean the cringe worthy ""Josh you're Chinese tell us about your experiences with this"")   I also think anthropology needs to figure out how to better appeal to people from different backgrounds. It is true that most departments aren't representative of the general demographics in America. But diversity in background helps us get better data and think about things in new ways."

Anthropology,3dmij4,bojun,11,Fri Jul 17 13:59:41 2015 UTC,"The truth is, we really don't know what caused the Classic Maya collapse.  But - last I checked in undergrad at Brown five years ago - one of the main prevailing theories was that there was some kind of ecological event that caused scarcity of food resources, which then to warfare and further scarcity of food resources, leading eventually to a complete collapse. It could have been a mega drought or deforestation or both or something else, but that's the general idea.  This article talks about one researcher who disagrees with the idea that deforestation was the cause of all that, because the Maya were expert jungle farmers. I'm totally willing to accept that they Maya were expert jungle farmers, but widespread deforestation leading to artificial droughts isn't due to individual Maya planters not understanding how to plant; it's a tragedy-of-the-commons situation when the entire system expands beyond the point of sustainability, even though/because every individual actor in the system is working in their own self-interest.  Clearing forests is a part of the milpa agriculture cycle, and too much of that in too widespread an area would have been bad.  So, her idea that the Maya were expert milpa agriculturalists and the theory that deforestation contributed to the Maya collapse aren't really mutually exclusive."
Anthropology,3dmij4,octaviusromulus,10,Fri Jul 17 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"Except that the term collapse isn't a correct one. In fact, very few collapses (huge depopulation, massive destruction, etc) rarely occur. Tainter 2006 and McAnany and Yoffee 2010 do an excellent job covering the concept of collapse. In fact, McAnany and Yoffee's paper is just the opening chapter in an entire book by historians and archaeologists on collapse.  As for the Maya, they did not collapse or die out at the end of the Classic period. They very much continued to thrive into the Postclassic with centers like Chichen Itza, Mayapan, Zaculeu, and Q'umarkaj. In fact, the last Maya kingdom was the Itza kingdom of Nojpeten which fell to the Spanish in 1697 because some young hotshot wanted to relive the glory days of his conquistador ancestors. We may have had an independent Maya nation situated around the Peten if it weren't for him."

Anthropology,3dmij4,Amadeus_Ray,6,Fri Jul 17 16:57:58 2015 UTC,"""...they probably just abandoned the empire...""   FYI, describing classical Maya polities as being part of a centralised political state like an empire is inaccurate. The most likely method of political organisation was an urban area led by a divine big man/monarch figure. These could project power over nearby populations, and engaged in political alliances which could separate states into opposing power blocs, but it doesn't seem that those alliances were centrally administered states.  To answer your question:  That Classical Maya civilisation was transformed into a less ostentatious form in the late first millennium is accepted. What archaeologists and anthropologists don't know for certain is why that change occurred. Overpopulation, famine, environmental/climate change, and accelerated inter-city warfare have all been proposed as key reasons behind the collapse of the divine kingships, but there's no universal agreement on what was most or least important among those factors."

Anthropology,3dpz6y,AlmightyAgnostic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:54:05 2015 UTC,"So, something to be aware of is that within anthropology, there has been kind of a split between the people interested in ""focuses on Biological processes of evolution rather than social side"" and the rest of the anthropologists.  As a result, the kind of people you would probably want to work with mostly aren't in the Anthropology department anymore.  For instance, Tim White has been over in the Biology department for a long time, although archaeology students sometimes take his class on skeletal identification.  Stanford's Anthropology department actually split into two departments for a few years over issues related to this problem.  I would suggest trying this: go to Google Scholar and start plugging in some search terms for stuff that interests you.  Look at the article titles and see what sounds like something you would want to read or work on (since you probably won't be able to access most of the articles).  Then see who the authors are, and what their university affiliations are - for instance on this citation the author's university is listed on the bottom right.  That will allow you to get an idea of where there are people working on the things you will be interested in.  There are still people working on the biological roots of behavior in Anthropology departments, but even they grumble about not being on the same page as a lot of the rest of the faculty.  Another option would be to go to the department webpages and look at the faculty lists, for instance here's UCLA.  Usually each faculty member will have a short list of research topics they are interested in, so you can do a search on these pages for things that interest you and identify programs that way.  I would look on the department pages for Anthropology and Biology due to the issue I described in the first paragraph."
Anthropology,3dmpls,ehead,2,Fri Jul 17 14:58:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where to start with this question, because it comes with a lot of assumptions that simply aren't true.  I have never read any work by any anthropologist suggesting that traditional societies have a cyclical concept of time and modern societies have a linear concept. In fact, the vast majority of anthropological thought in the last, say 30 years, has questioned the idea that societies can even be designated ""traditional"" or ""modern"". I've also ""heard it said"" like you - but never read any actual anthropological work making this argument.  I apologise in advance for being a bit vague with my references here, since I don't have my books with me (in Tanzania doing my fieldwork) and my internet is currently too shitty to look up pdf articles online. But I'm going to say that as far as I remember this view was largely influenced by Talal Asad's writings starting in the 80s. He was writing largely about the concept of secularism, but it also has to do with tradition and modernity. To summarise briefly, the existence of the concepts ""traditional"", ""modern"", and ""secular"", and the idea that they are separate, are in themselves distinct features of modernity.  So not only are you thinking that there's an anthropological theory here that there isn't, it's also based on a dichotomy that most anthropologists suggest does not actually exist. And, even if it did exist, there is so much diversity in the world that you could not reasonably expect to compare ""Traditional Society A"" with ""Traditional Society B"" somewhere else on that basis alone.  That's not even getting to the ""traditional societies don't have a concept of progress"" idea. But in the same vein as above, a) ""traditional societies"" do not exist, and b) even if they did, there is enough diversity in the world that I would seriously hesitate to argue that they must have any specific thing in common, nevermind the lack of an idea about progress.  Furthermore, I don't know of any work arguing for the lack of a concept of progress. I'm coming from an anthropology of development background, so I can't necessarily speak to ideas about progress in philosophical or historical terms (although I wonder to what degree this idea of progress is influenced by institutional Christianity).   However--and this is just in terms of my personal impression of the state of the discipline in general--I would say most anthropologists of development would be extremely hesitant to support that argument. Definitely during the 1990s there was a strong trend of post-structuralist anthropology which would have rejected it completely as an instrument of neo-colonialism (e.g. work by Escobar and Hobart would fall into this vein).  Speaking of development though, it is worth noting that ""linear"" conceptions of development e.g. terms of social evolution were indeed prevalent at one point in anthropology, and this is one of the criticisms of Marxist development theory as well."

I've just been listening to some college lectures from a joint undergraduate/graduate sociology class I managed to find online. The teacher is very enthusiastic and fun to listen to but occasionally says things that sound like non-sense. He tries to be inter-disciplinary, pulling in stuff from art history, anthropology, and other areas. Currently they are talking about this book called ""The Culture of Time and Space"".   I think it's interesting what you said about the ""traditional""/""modern"" distinction because he is a HUGE fan of this distinction, and is constantly talking about how different things used to be... you know, way back when. The coming of modernity was accompanied with seismic changes in his opinion. I personally feel like he over emphasizes these differences, or at least the huge differences he claims between the ""psychology"" and outlook of people in the past vs. now.  It's one of those ideas that is a ""fun"" idea. It kind of makes you wistfully stare out the window and ponder big thoughts, and question your own outlook, but I wonder how much we can really know about such psychological differences, even if they did exist."

Dogs would have been useful in a hunter gatherer society in helping with hunting as well as protecting camp sites and providing early warning of predators and enemies. Cats only became useful to humans in agrarian settings where they functioned as pest control. Looking at it that way, the interaction between dogs and humans would have not only been more ancient, it would have also been a more complex dynamic. That, in turn, would have led to more opportunities to co-evolve and fine-tune the relationship. So we may have co-evolved with both, but I expect it would have been to a greater degree with dogs."

One night, while romantically holding hands on the beach, he leaned in and kissed her.  Apparently, she screamed, got up and ran away. It later turned out that their people never kissed, and had always kind of suspected white people might be cannibals, so when he kissed her she thought he was tasting her in preparation for cooking.

Anthropology,3dfcc5,DivideByGodError,11,Thu Jul 16 03:18:42 2015 UTC,"Something like this actually happened in Japan during and after the second world war. I'm not an anthropologist, but this is connected to another topic that I'm quite interested in: the post-war reconstruction of the Japanese identity through cinema. Granted, it's not really a case of kissing being introduced to a culture that never had it before, but I think it's an interesting example of how entertainment has been used to promote kissing.  While the practice of kissing was not unknown in Japan, it wasn't traditionally something that would be displayed publicly, as it was mainly confined to sexual foreplay. During the second world war, the Japanese wartime censors banned any kissing from films as they considered the practice a sign of Western decadence and not part of Japanese culture. Japanese films could not feature kissing, and kissing scenes were cut from foreign films shown in Japan.  After Japan lost the war and the American Occupation began, cinema became one of the outlets through which the Americans set out to construct the kind of Japan that they felt comfortable with. Many subjects in films were banned while others were encouraged. One of the explicitly promoted topics was kissing, as the Americans felt that the Japanese had a tendency to hide their thoughts and feelings, and that the society needed to be more open. The American censors put pressure on Japanese film studios to include kissing scenes in films that they produced, reasoning that if the Japanese kissed in private, they should be doing it in public as well, even if the meaning of a kiss in these two settings are very different.  This created a trend of what has been called ""kissing films"". Studios began systematically adding kissing scenes into new films, at first fairly awkwardly (the first film typically considered a ""kissing film"" is Twenty-Year-Old Youth from 1946, where the scene in question apparently received nervous laughter from the audience) and later with more skill and confidence. Actors took lessons from Americans stationed in Japan, and some apparently even travelled to the US with the purpose of studying the technique of kissing.  While these films turned out to be popular once the audiences warmed up to the practice, many directors protested against the requirements as they felt that they were now under pressure from the censorship boards to include kissing scenes in any film that depicted romantic relationships, thinking that since (public) kissing had not been part of the Japanese way, they were now unable to tell those stories authentically. There were plenty of arguments both ways, but ultimately these scenes were there to stay, and with the help of lifestyle magazines (which were also used to promote the act), kissing in Japan became more accepted and widespread than it had been before the war, no longer so strictly confined to sexual foreplay.  Although as I understand it, kissing in public is still something of a taboo in Japan.  So, not quite the same thing as the topic of the linked paper, but I thought quite interesting nonetheless.  Sources:  Hirano, Kyoko. Mr. Smith Goes to Tokyo: Japanese Cinema under the American Occupation, 1945-1952. Especially chapter 4, section ""Kissing and Sexual Expression"".  Kitamura, Hiroshi.

I thought they were only looking at fairly recent (20th century?) ethnographic data with little time depth, so I thought exposure to visual media entertainment could be taken as a factor correlated with romantic kissing, at least as a display of affection.  Still, I suppose you're right that romantic kissing would likely predate films in many parts of the world."

I wasn't suggesting that the romantic kiss originated with Hollywood films. I thought that films could have been a medium through which the practice of romantic kissing reached parts of the worlds where it wasn't practiced or considered a norm before the 20th century.  The authors say that the romantic kiss is associated with greater social stratification and social complexity--as if romantic kissing is a behavior that might just appear at a particular social evolutionary stage. They don't seem to consider the idea that the romantic kiss simply diffused from a few parts of the world."

I found it interesting!) because I live in Vanuatu and know some of the people quoted.  For the first, as far as Takara moving goes, you have to understand that sea level rise really is affecting lots of coastal communities in Vanuatu, so this is totally accurately viewed as a problem here. Currently the biggest issue is well salination, but some places in Vanuatu now have churches that are about to fall into the salt water and graves that are getting water over them on high tide. Not cool. Takara owns a lot of ground and it will be (relatively) easy for them to move--like they won't have to purchase any more ground. They have a mix of permanent and semi-permanent housing, and they're not currently on the electric grid, so it won't be as hard as some places to move people.    As far as what the director of NDMO said, it's totally true here that fruits and vegetables aren't growing at the right times anymore. You especially notice it with fruit trees like mangoes. Some of them have always had a second season, but the times when the flowers come out are changing. NDMO is encouraging villagers to adapt to climate change by using new and different agricultural techniques. Mostly the biggest issue that people are citing is laplap leaves burning because the sun is too hot--laplap is a root vegetable pudding and a very popular traditional dish. I think slowly maybe there will be different agricultural techniques adopted, but not yet.  As far as the quote from Vila North's head teacher goes, she's on the other side of the island. Vila North is a seriously, seriously, seriously overcrowded school. The kids were sitting on the floors to begin with in a lot of the classes. It's one of the few schools in Vanuatu that has such serious overcrowding issues, and we're talking like one teacher for forty or fifty kids or even more, where with desk the teacher can't even walk around, and where the kids who have learning disabilities basically never get any special attention. So honestly I can't imagine the tents are helping, but it's not like that school was a high performing school to begin with.   And did I mention that even though it's El Nino, and supposed to be the dry season anyway, last week it was absolutely downpouring rain? There was a cyclone in the Solomons earlier this month, and cyclone season is November-May, NOT July. It's messed up."
Anthropology,3d2zg7,ditfloss,35,Mon Jul 13 02:51:19 2015 UTC,"No humans have ever been peaceful, and amongst our relatives it's pretty much only the gorillas that are 'peaceful'.  The difference is primarily one of the level and scale of violence.  In the past violence was personal and restricted to the small number of others you encountered.    As the population grew and we settled into an agricultural system several things happened that led to a wider scope for violence (and a different kind of violence as well):  large sedentary populations, hierarchical social organization (including organized religions), a radical change in gender roles, long-term storage of large amounts of food, and a sense of ownership over the land itself.  This led the the formation of armies and a greater sense of ""us vs them"" and allowed for greater dehumanization of the opponents and a way of expanding the ""it's for our survival"" argument beyond purely personal danger.  In the modern age we have relatively strict laws to prevent the sort of personal violence that occurred between people in pre-agricultural societies, but we now wage war at a far larger and more impersonal level based on interests that often do not coincide with those doing the fighting.  In a day-to-day level we may well be less violent and more peaceful than our predecessors, but at a societal level we are still very violent.  This was how the difference was presented during my anthropology studies."

As a result, laymen and those with ulterior motives alike jump to the tired old chestnut that the West brought peace and civility to the world.  Pick any region in history that has yet to develop State level societies and you'll find that the number of culture groups that existed before the development of States in the area was far greater than those that existed after.  When circumstances are right for a society to begin developing a State apparatus, a period of warfare and subjugation almost always follows.  Early states expand, incorporate their enemies into their framework, and as a result of the decreased diversity of the region you are left with ""peace.""  Sure, if one looks at the matter in terms of raw statistics it is easy to conclude that this is an improvement of circumstances.  But when one digs beyond the surface of the matter, a series of other questions and a different kind of violence is revealed.  Scalping, human sacrifice, and mutilation are dramatic to us because they are foreign and therefore we are not so desensitized to them.  They are easily quantified, easily recognized in the archaeological record, so they stand out.  But psychological, sociological violence and oppression is both harder to quantify and something we have normalized.  If you take a formally independent, hunter-gatherer society, conquer them, then throw them all on a plantation as slaves on an objective, statistical level one can easily make the argument that their circumstances have improved.  Whereas before they may have ""warred"" with their neighbors on a regular basis, now their lack of freedom and subordinated status has dramatically reduced the number of violent conflicts they are likely to encounter.  But that piece of data doesn't reflect the actualities of their circumstances.  The loss of independence, cultural identity, the psychological terror that comes with being subordinated is totally smoothed over.  We as a society are largely numb to that reality.  We have naturalized the subjugation of the Other, the destruction of a hunter-gatherer culture is not only normal to us but implicitly unimportant because we view the ends - namely our present social structure - as more valuable than what was lost.  But the logic that underpins this thinking, this celebration of ""civilization"" as the great improver of our circumstances is immediately lost when it is inverted and applied to us.  Ironically no culture on Earth is more obsessed with this than Western culture.  If the ends justify the means, if the forced incorporation of many cultures into a single social framework is justified because competition and violence is reduced then logically a world government, built through conquest, is not progress but downright desirable.  If Iran and the United States ceased to exist, if Russia and the EU ceased to exist, if Japan and China ceased to exist, if the cultures and competing interests each of these countries were forcibly incorporated under a single culture, a single value system, a single political structure then the amount of war on our planet would be dramatically reduced and in a statistical sense our new global dictator would actually be the world's greatest peace maker.  Sure, there would be a brief uptick in the number of deaths, starvation, and misery as nuclear weapons detonated and the primitives resisted being hauled off to work camps but think big picture people! Mathematically it all evens out over the centuries.  The vast majority of people would find that reasoning to be ridiculous and would work to avoid it happening in the real world - why? Because when it is our cultures, our families, our world that is being subordinated things take on a degree of reality that works like this don't capture.   The reality of the matter is that our present state of affairs is an experiment.  Agricultural society is a blip on the radar compared to how long we practiced hunter-gatherer lifeways.  When one considers the ecological and technological menaces that face us in the immediate future, there is a very real possibility that it will fail altogether - in a display of death and carnage that no hunter-gatherer society could ever match.  I am by no means calling for a return to the forests but I find this celebration of conquest and forced assimilation to be very suspicious...."

A lot of the things I brought up can be found pretty easily with a search, but there are a lot of different interpretations when it comes to what it all means in terms of human behavior.

This imposes a fundamentally different conceptual mindset between the two groups and can be a major basis for conflict.  On the surface both groups are protective of their territory and for similar reasons, but the underlying relationship with the land as property is different."

Where your culture is dependent on the land rivalries between tribes is inevitable, especially, as you point out, once the population grows to where tribes abut.

The term ""holding feet to the fire"" was imported to Europe from NA after Jesuits saw that particular torture applied to prisoners to the delight of on-lookers.

I think the basic problem is that he's offering a false dichotomy: you can either believe in the ""professor's"" explanation, OR you can just assume ceremony is ""natural"" and ""obvious"" but basically incomprehensible. But we have other methodological options he doesn't consider. That's where anthropology comes in. Also, note that he doesn't consider you might ask ""the savages"" why they perform a particular ceremony. Maybe they have ideas of their own?  I assume Chesterton is writing too early to be aware of all the methods and theories developed in anthropology to interpret ceremony."

Anthropology,3czoas,apparently_not_taken,2,Sun Jul 12 12:01:27 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of it before let alone in any anthropology classes. Chesterton was writing in the 1900s (died mid 30s), so this is decidedly the first modernish era of anthropology. I'd almost say it's too complicated for an intro class unless one is going for an extremely limited discussion- that there doesn't have to be this overly complex, culturally driven based on societal reprisal ad for why people can do certain cultural acts. They do it just to do it- ad we all do.  It's also a critique to another work or academic discourse for the day, and I'd like to see what that was as well."
Anthropology,3czoas,Vio_,10,Sun Jul 12 13:55:41 2015 UTC,"I've never come across Chesterton's essay in an anthropological context, just occasionally on weird corners or reddit.  There's not much to rebut because it's essentially an anti-intellectual critique of the discipline of a century ago. Most of the essay consists of logical fallacies and arguments from Chesterton's own ignorance; in the few places where he stumbles across a legitimate problem with the anthropological thought of the day, it's one that has been much more competently critiqued by many much more competent scholars.  The excerpt in your post rests on Chesterton's assertion that ""ceremonial is essentially a thing which is done without a reason"" (his ""ceremonial"" being what we'd call ""ritual"" these days.) He doesn't have any evidence for this assertion. He seems to regard it as a common sense truth obvious to everyone except head-in-the-clouds ""men of science."" From there, he makes up some straw anthropologists who provide absurd explanations of simple human behaviours. His own 'common sense' explanation is that people just do what is ""obvious and natural"" to them.  If you're being generous, I suppose you could say Chesterton misunderstood what anthropologists (then and now) consider an explanation of a social practice. (I'd tend to be less generous, and say it's deliberately sophistic rhetoric from a pseudo-intellectual with an ideological commitment to propping up the faltering idea of the white man's burden.) He considers ritual to be something that's done without a reason, just because it's ""obvious and natural"". Anthropologists recognise that is a reason in itself, and aren't satisfied with it as an explanation. They ask, why is it obvious and natural? Why that specific practise, and not some other? Why is it different from place to place? The kind of explanations anthropologists have come up with has certainly changed a lot since 1905, but that's essentially still what we're trying to do. Chesterton's problem is that he thinks these are things that don't require explanation, and in this his is just one in a long line of anti-intellectual critics saying that social science ""explains the obvious."" But unless you think human beings act completely at random, that's a logical fallacy: even if it ""obvious"" (it's not), there is a web of causality behind all behaviour.  As an aside, the whole essay is laced with a sneering racism that's bad even for its time: Chesterton obviously thinks trying to understand ""the secret of why some savage tribe worships monkeys or the moon"" is a waste of time that would be better spent de-savagising them by converting them to Christianity (or shooting them.)"
Anthropology,3czoas,brigantus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:08:05 2015 UTC,"I think his basic error is in logic.  He is saying that because people don't understand why they do things, or because the things they do are irrational, that there must be no reason behind their actions, and that we cannot understand them.  Firstly, this is logically fallacious. It only states that there is lack of rational reason, not that there is lack of all reason. There can still be (and usually are) seemingly irrational reasons.   Secondly, actions that appear irrational to outsiders may seem quite rational to insiders. It does not seem rational to dress a dead body up in fine clothes and makeup before putting it in the ground. But there are rational reasons why we do it - to see a loved one in good light, to present them well in our last memories (amongst other reasons).   I believe they put food or weapons on the dead for the same reason that we put flowers, because it is an exceedingly natural and obvious thing to do.   Again this one strikes me as self defeatingly ethnocentric. These things appear natural and obvious only to insiders. To outsiders they appear irrational and foreign. Thus there must be cultural structures that create the sense of the action being natural and obvious. The anthropologist's job is to discover and describe what those cultural structures are."
Anthropology,3czoas,sobri909,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:28:31 2015 UTC,"You already got the answer you were looking for, I hope, but I'm curious: What do you find intuitively appealing in Chesterton's argument? I'm genuinely curious to understand how your background makes you think that ""all important emotions of human existence"" are irrational? That is rather heavily at odds with, for example, Adam Smith's thinking on moral emotions."
Anthropology,3czoas,vehka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:08:53 2015 UTC,"I guess you could say I am attracted to the idea that ""ceremonial is a thing done essentially without a reason"".  Chesterton seems (to me in any rate) to be arguing that the most apparently orderly and structured elements of social life are really animal and instinctive in their nature, not rational. He is saying that it is precisely when we feel most strongly that we have a rational reason for behaving in a certain way that we are most likely to be behaving instinctively without knowing it.  I thus read what some commenters have described as his ""ethnocentrism"" in this essay (his assumption that people in other cultures do the things they do for the same reasons we do the things we do) in a very different light.  By my light, Chesterton is accusing the anthropologists themselves of ethnocentrism. He is accusing them of being willing to accept simple explanations for alien ceremonial when they would never dream of offering so simple an explanation of their own ceremonies. Instead of offering either a simple OR a complex explanation for either, Chesterton offers the alternative suggestion that neither culture or its members really understands why they are doing what they do, and if that is so, it is entirely useless to ask them why they are doing it. They would be better off thinking about why they themselves do what they do, because if they did that, they would realize that they really don't know at all.  Now, the first part of this chain of reasoning (his attack on men of science who are willing to accept self-reported explanations for foreign ceremonial) may be a straw-man argument or merely a condemnation of certain 'bad' anthropologists and racial theorists (remember that this essay was written in the context of a larger argument against eugenics, racial theories of progress, etc.)  But it's the remainder of the argument that I find appealing.  When Chesterton says:   The secret of why some savage tribe worships monkeys or the moon is not to be found even by travelling among those savages and taking down their answers in a note-book, although the cleverest man may pursue this course. The answer to the riddle is in England; it is in London; nay, it is in his own heart. When a man has discovered why men in Bond Street wear black hats he will at the same moment have discovered why men in Timbuctoo wear red feathers.   I think he is speaking ironically. The men in Bond Street don't really know why they wear black hats, and that's his point. The answer to the riddle is that there is no answer. It's a koan.  What I find appealing is not the attack upon the desire to understand other cultures (that attack, if present and not merely meant ironically, is genuinely obscurantist) but rather the warning against thinking that we understand more than we really do.  Thanks for the question, and also for the responses I've gotten. They've been very helpful."

I’ve read Smith’s essay and he doesn’t claim this as far as I can see. In fact, it would be strange if he did since the evidence we have for animal sacrificial requirements (i.e Israelite) are very clear that the animals need to be young, healthy, and without blemish, the very best of what those making the sacrifice have to offer.  Yet, the article writer doesn’t stop with merely misrepresenting Smith’s argument, but with then conflating animal sacrifice with human sacrifice. Smith never once mentions human sacrifice. In fact we have records of Aztec requirements for sacrificial victims, and they are even stricter than the Hebrew requirements for animal sacrifices.

For new grads the biggest challenge is the catch22 of ""need experience to get experience"". You need to do you need to do EVERYTHING possible to get some experience before you graduate.     Internships:  anything even remotely close to the field would be good.  This needs to be a huge priority until land one.  Summer, Fall, even 2nd semester.  The longer and more hours the better (as long as it doesn't interfere too much with your studies). Can you work with a professor who does this kind of work?  Email anyone at your university who is relevant and ask about being a research assistant or something. If you are a senior many schools/departments have capstone or independent study projects.  Find a professor who will oversee you conducting the kind of project you would do in the job you are imagining. Informational interviews:  start contacting people who work in the kinds of jobs/orgs you are interested in and ask them for 30 minute informational interviews (even by phone).  Come prepared with intelligent questions about the work they do and ask for advice about how to break into and prepare for the field.      Be proactive and good things are likely to happen.  Good luck!"

Like jobs, grad school questions have been asked a few times to make sure you search this subreddit to get all you can from the collective wisdom. The AAA has a career center area for its website.  http://www.aaanet.org/profdev/careers/  I would look there to get info on careers and figure out where grad school fits in. Look at job postings on the AAA site and places like indeed.com  What are they looking for?  What skills do you have?  What skills do you need?  Where can you get those skills?  (e.g., will grad school help or not for what you want to do). If you want to go to grad school try really hard to go to relevant academic conferences.  Talk with professors in those programs and get the dirt on those programs from grad students.  You still have a year of undergrad so start figuring out who you can get letters of recommendation from.  Work on building up those relationships.   Ask them for advice too (they might have connections at programs you are interested in).  If you go for an MA I'm a big fan of trying to do it somewhere that you can get a dual MA (this can often be done in 3 years or even less).  I don't know about your specialty, but graduating with an MA in natural resources management and an MA in evironmental anthro (just picking a random pair) would be great.  Maybe an MPH (public health) and MA in anthro focusing on environmental anthro?  Lots of cool possibilities, but can help. If you do go the grad school route a lot of my previous advice still applies.  Make sure you are getting practical/applied experience (be it as a research assistant, working part time, or as an intern) so that when you graduate you can point to that experience when applying for jobs.  Doing some informational interviews along the way is still important.    Sorry if that was a lot of info :)  good luck!"

It's a shitty market for the non-STEM folks though.   If you are very into Forensic anthropology, I highly highly highly recommend majoring in Biology or Chemistry with a minor in anthropology. You'll will be muuuch more marketable, and never stuck. It also sets you up for forensic work in the future, as you need to get a PhD for forensic jobs, and you'll have the science out of the way.

I have been lucky enough to get a taste of the field last summer, digging a roman cemetery and a Coper cerimonial site (shitty salary and hard work but at least I loved every minute).  Sorry to crush your dreams but I still believe it is possible to work in the field, just get your head in books, work real hard and start right now getting experience and building a network of conections (spend your summer vacations of the field as much as you can and ask for contacts).  Best of luck.  Edit: spelling, english is not my first language."

From what I can tell (and please correct me if I'm wrong), it seems they generally care more about the Academics there and Archaeology/Anthropology jobs in particular pay better. That's a very general statement - I know it definitely varies by location."

How expensive is land out there? Finding the room for a hydro op is much more difficult compared to owning a half to full acre, setting up a decent size greenhouse and going that route.

Anthropology,3cmdxk,dutchesse,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:12:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, my bad - Montana. The price of land in Washington is really dependant upon the area you want to live in. For example, the closet you are to Seattle, the more expensive everything is. But I bet that's typical of most large cities. The great thing about Western WA is you can live pretty cheaply in the county, outside of city limits, and yet still be close enough to ""civilization"" that it's only a 20-30 min drive away. I really don't know much about land prices here though, I'm sorry.   I'd definitely recommend checking out Bellingham if you decide to move WA, especially if you want to get into the pot business. Bellingham is 1.5hrs north of Seattle and about 40 min south of the Canadian border. It's a great place - University town, lots of young people, but in a beautiful natural setting."

Similar questions have been asked before, so it is worth doing a search on this (and related) subreddits.   2) The AAA has a section on Careers in Anthropology.  Probably worth exploring that and seeing if you get any ideas:  http://www.aaanet.org/profdev/careers/  3) Your university probably has a career center, which you are probably still eligible to access.  They help they provide is highly variable, but worth checking out.  If nothing else they can help you to make sure that your cover letter and resume are on point.  If that doesn't work, might be worth spending a little on a resume expert so you can really shine.  4) If you find people that have jobs that look interesting, ask them for ""informational interviews"".  This can be great for networking and helping you prepare for when you get real interviews.  Just make sure you show up with a list of good questions to ask that specific person and respect their time.  5) I'd consider checking out MPH programs (public health) or even getting a dual MA Anthro/MPH.  It's a cool area to be in and it sounds like your studies to date would be useful.   Good luck!"

Volunteer at conferences for free registration and a way to non-awkwardly meet people you don't know. Your school also probably has decent travel funds. If you haven't already, consider student membership in the American Anthropological Association which scales based on your salary, so $60 if you make less than 20k/year. Another ten dollars and you're a student member of the Society for Medical Anthropology which gets you the online journal as well as other resources. Get your name out in the society by volunteering in some capacity, whether it's writing a book review or being a student representative.   Keep building your CV. In addition to your own research and classes, see if your department/school has opportunities for you to put yourself out there. Chat with professors over coffee, ones outside of your specialty know different people which might lead to different opportunities. Help with grad student conferences, apply for research funds, bring in guest speakers. Present at all the conferences you can as soon as you can, especially smaller ones where there's more feedback. There are also usually some travel grants sponsored by a conference if you're presenting, so again, you can do so on the cheap.   Don't neglect public engagement, either. Give public talks, judge high school science fairs, and build up an online presence.  Don't forget to relax, either, and socialize with your fellow students!"

For example, if you're under the notion that acupuncture, aromatherapy, or therapeutic teas are foolish medical options you are going to struggle in working with people who have lived in China where those are used heavily.  I'm not saying /u/why_so_reguhluh should dump all their time into researching these alternative medicines, but they should be familiar with these if they want to establish rapport and understanding with peoples of various cultures and backgrounds. Look at the ebola outbreak throughout Africa lately.  Until they sent medical anthropologists, doctors were struggling to establish trust with locals and were being lied to regarding their patients health.  It wasn't until the medical anthropologists recognized the locals' understanding of medicine and their superstitions that they were able to establish a relationship of trust where they were being informed correctly and their procedures were being taken advantage of."

Look, as far as I can see, there are only three CAM methods that work at all: Massage Therapy, TCM, and Acupuncture. Chiropractic medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy, and aromatherapy are all bullshit in regards to health.  Acupuncture is difficult to double-blind, and it is difficult to determine if it works, but there are some positive studies. TCM is herbal medicine, often based on outdated knowledge. A lot of folk medicine was built on the idea of random plants and objects looking like what they wanted to cure. Walnuts for the brain, the porous St. John's Wort for the skin, etc. I still believe they are a good study, but caution must be applied.  I am a student of massage therapy, and it's probably the most grounded in current reality, and while there are musculoskeletal issues I can improve, I see no ability to cure really anything without making up random shit like ""myofascial adhesions"" and such.  CAM is generally bullshit. What little that does work is often already used in modern medicine (except Acupuncture). Alternative medicine that works is called medicine."

What it basically boils down to is the article author realizing that many of her research questions were rooted in cultural views and her assumption from her culture that winter is ""bad"" and something that has to be tolerated. She also seems to imply that although her research questions were at first culturally biased, they shifted after some insight into North-Norwegian culture but still, to me, as a Norwegian, this ""wintertime-mindset"" concept is skating on thin ice between having any scientific credibility and total nonsense."

The passage I remember goes as follows:   He said in his speech that the fire under the chief's posterior was to remind him that he was not sitting on this seat to rest himself but to work for his people; he was to look alive even though he sat on the chair of office. Furthermore, he was not to forget who had put the fire under him; a member of the barrio that would appoint the chief for the next year; and that it was done to remind him from the outset that he could not cling to the office but had to give it up as soon as his time was up, so as to prevent any risk of a lifelong rule, which would be injurious to the welfare of his people. If he tried to cling to his office they would put a fire under him that would be large enough to consume both him and his chair."

In Canada, beavers are a pain in the ass to almost any land owner. They f%ck everything up.

But it distracts from the work at hand.  Anyway, this is an appealing idea, but while it's easy to see how this works with full blown modern language, it's hard to see how this bootstrapping worked with the early minimal rudiments of language.  ""No you idiot! No! No! Yes, there you go...no, not that again!""  vs. ""Incline the striking stone at a steeper angle""  The earliest language perforce must have begun very simply, maybe something like verb + noun, with initially verbs and nouns being small closed sets, and then become more complex over time due to the incremental advantage of the previous stage.  But even verb+noun couldn't have sprung full-blown from the brow of Zeus, it too must have had even simpler beginnings, like a stage between it and a set of warning cries like those of macaque monkeys.

Facial ""reconstructions"" like this one are essentially 3-D artistic renderings and in general do not reflect how the person looked whose skull is ostensibly being used as the basis for the reconstruction."
Anthropology,3baka3,deaconblues99,2,Sat Jun 27 19:02:33 2015 UTC,Do you have any information on how these reconstructions are made from skulls and their dubious accuracy?
Anthropology,3baka3,NoNations,2,Sun Jun 28 04:38:39 2015 UTC,"First, they rely on average figures for tissue depth at various landmarks.  But while average values do a great job of capturing the central tendency of a population, they're less useful when it comes to extrapolation to the individual, particularly with respect to something as variable as facial features.  Second, most of what makes us look like us, in the end, is soft tissue.  There's not really a good way to extrapolate soft tissue features from the underlying bone structure.  The nose, for example-- beyond the nasal bone, that's all cartilage, but the shape of the nose beyond the nasal bone is a particularly individual trait that changes how we look markedly.  Lips and ears, also.  I like to point to three examples that are particularly useful to illustrate how much ""interpretation"" goes into this.  Kennewick Man  Based on Jim Chatters's description of Kennewick's features as ""Caucasoid,"" a facial reconstruction artist created this reconstruction.  The famous ""Patrick Stewart"" head.  Years later, another artist produced this recreation.  Same skull.  But the difference is that the artist was given different instructions from the people who commissioned the jobs.  Assuming that reconstruction was at all scientific, there should be at least some similarity.  But even allowing for the difference in the two based on the hair / beard in the second, these look nothing alike.  Gail Mathews  Gail Mathews was a victim of the Green River killer in the early 1980s.  A reconstruction of her face based on her skull ended up with features more similar to an Hispanic or Native American woman in her mid-40s, despite the fact that she was 23 years old.  And while I don't know her ethnicity, it's certainly the case that her photo looks ""nothing like the reconstruction that was done.  The Crystal Head Vodka reconstruction  About a year ago or so, someone with a master's in forensic and medical art did a full facial ""reconstruction"" using the skull-shaped ""Crystal Head"" vodka bottle.  That skull possesses few if any actual, anatomical landmarks of a real skull.  The artist used the standard forensic techniques, though, and came up with a somewhat whimsical, but anatomically accurate, face.  What this illustrates is the degree to which the artist does an interpretation rather than a reconstruction.  Lacking landmarks, and using a ""skull"" that was never a part of a living person, the artists nevertheless created a completely believable face."

I think that the author only mentioned sadism because it is a popular theme in movies, books, TV, etc.  that there are individuals out there that enjoy inflicting pain upon others.  It's just to set the stage for the argument that that's not how violence occurs in the real world.  The majority of violent acts are perpetrated by someone that knows full and well that they are hurting another human (and not necessarily enjoying it), but feels that the action is necessary and justified in the given social context."
Anthropology,3ayfbg,oneftxoneft,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:26:49 2015 UTC,I find it interesting though that people do commit violent acts in accordance with their principles of justice. I wonder if there is something within the individual that causes him or her to lash out due to guilt or shame. Perhaps there is a build up of anxiety or insecurities that when a moment of justice presents itself the individual capitalizes and treats the violent act as a lashing on himself or herself but through the scapegoat of another human. What are your thoughts?
Anthropology,3ayfbg,oneftxoneft,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"treats the violent act as a lashing on himself or herself but through the scapegoat of another human.   That seems to be the gist what the author is saying at the end, and pretty what I also believe, is that an act of violence against one is to the detriment of us all.  It doesn't solve anything and all it does do is make violence more socially acceptable or common.  I do think shame plays a big part in the lead up to the violent act.  Injury to the (perceived) self helps cleave that 'other' right off and then it's really easy to do what you have to do to settle the score."

Wikipedia:  ""Today's Confederados maintain affection for the Confederate flag even though they consider themselves completely Brazilian. In Brazil, the Confederate flag has not had the racial stigma that has been attached to it in the United States. Many modern Confederados are of mixed-race and reflect the varied racial categories that make up Brazilian society in their physical appearance.   Recently the Brazilian residents of Americana, now of primarily Italian descent, have removed the Confederate flag from the city's crest citing the fact that Confederados now make up only 10% of the city's population. In 1972, then Governor (and future President) Jimmy Carter of Georgia visited the city of Santa Bárbara d'Oeste and visited the grave of his wife Rosalyn's great-uncle, who was one of the original Confederados.  Between 1960 and 1970, the rapid development of Americana caused many people to relocate to search for work. Because of its size, there was not enough room to accommodate the new residents and many lived in the border of Santa Bárbara d'Oeste and Americana, creating what is known today as ""Zona Leste de Santa Bárbara"" (East Santa Barbara)."

For the most part, only the top R1 public and private schools can afford to maintain these, so the list is somewhat short, and what you would expect (Harvard, UPenn, UChicago, Michigan, etc.).  Some schools will let you do beginning ancient languages or ancient literature / religion in translation at the B.A. level, but you want a Near Eastern studies type of program if you're looking to master the languages and scripts or go on for graduate work.  I'll add that Sumerian is a language isolate, and Akkadian is an East Semitic language (with nearly a dozen dialects) so they're not linguistically related (although of course many Akkadian-writing scribes also knew Sumerian and intersperse it in interesting ways).  There are a few exceptions to the above rule (I'm thinking of Henry Wright at the University of Michigan, who teaches in the Anthro program), but these situations are usually because the faculty members are focused on archaeology of Mesopotamia, rather than the language and literature of the regions."

Anthropology,3ac5zl,stephenjash,4,Thu Jun 18 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"This might prove unpopular, but I still want the data.  I want know how humanity evolved, and trace our ancestors movements over time.  For any group of modern humans to deny, or seek to deny scientists access to evidence or information on the basis of genetic similarity seems anti-science and intellectually backwards.    I don't view repressing research and seeking information as honouring an ancestor.  We need to know who someone was in order to honour them, not the other way around.  I don't mean that we shouldn't demonstrate cultural sensitivity, but how many generations back do we have to go in order to examine remains?  If a similar religious belief springs up in Africa, do we simply stop excavating and give Lucy back to whomever claims her?  I'll go put my Nomex on."
Anthropology,3ac5zl,exgiexpcv,6,Fri Jun 19 12:06:44 2015 UTC,I don't think you're appreciating the historical context of why we are at the point where ancestral groups will deny access to their ancestors for scientific study.

How many generations do we have to go back before remains of mixed ancestry can be investigated?   Each time someone encounters some ancient remains must we then say, ""Whoh, stop, it could be a NAGPRA violation.""    If all ethnic groups did the same, then where would this field go?

I think mending relationships and communicating how science can actually help tell their story is critical for enabling future research of this type, of course in a broader context than this isolated study.

Anthropology,3a4gtk,ridiculousrssndoll,8,Wed Jun 17 03:56:27 2015 UTC,"TL;DR:  Keeping control over the sexual impulses of the young helps older generations maintain their grip on all aspects of power in a culture that much more firmly. It seems to me this is a more stable cultural model than other alternatives, so we might have ended up in a sexually-frustrated culture born of a sexually-fixated religious heritage even if it weren't the Abrahamic worldview.  Edit: Saw the 'I'm a Christian' and thought I was in /r/atheism. Apologies if it sounds like I'm spoon-feeding you guys a Kinship & Social Organization syllabus. Thought I was preaching to a different choir.  /u/dropkickpa says inheritance... It's probably more this than not, but you might be asking a chicken-and-egg question.   Controlling copulation really gets you most of the way to controlling every other aspect of a culture. And if that's true, then no matter what worldview served as a cultural backdrop for such a big chunk of humanity, no matter what code we inherited would probably have a great deal to say about sex.  I'm reminded of an old anthropological debate about the sources of inter-band violence among a South American tribe, the Yanomami. One anthropologist, Marvin Harris believed it could be attributed mostly to access to protein through controlling territory. Napoleon Chagnon believed it was all about access to sex through controlling marriage. I don't remember how the debate ended up, but you probably see the same thing playing out throughout human history.   The OT does have quite a bit to say about the raising and slaughtering of animals, and the planting, harvesting, and preparation and storage of crops. But it has much more to say about sex, marriage, and daughters and wives as property.  I know the history of Judeo-Christian thought seems anything but stable, but consider it from the point of view of a system. Sure, there are thousands of different Abrahamic sects now, but almost all share this bizarre fixation with good vs. bad sex. Rigid sexual controls go a long way to ensure smooth transitions of property and less material culture from one generation to the next.   The kinds of pastoral, horticultural, or early agricultural peoples still around today use marriage among and between kin groups to solidify social bonds at all levels in their respective societies. There's no reason to believe that the Israelites described in the semi-historical Old Testament would have done things any differently.   It's not the only inter-generationally stable arrangement, but it's one commonly found throughout anthropological literature today. You work the land with your sons, trading away your daughters to wed the sons of your neighbors. In return, you receive word that when your sons are ready, there will be brides for them too - handpicked by your neighbors from their daughter of appropriate age. In this way, you and your neighbors are continually indebted to one another, as the cycle of birth never ends. Even better, lacking any other permissible sexual release, your sons are eager to please you through their labor, wanting to prove their readiness to start a family of their own. (And get that ass.)  Its just as common to see young men setting out to join their productivity to the hearth of their bride's household. But from what I understand of the OT, trading women away seemed more the norm."
Anthropology,3a4gtk,Brokenshatner,3,Wed Jun 17 05:14:47 2015 UTC,"This was really helpful, thank you so much! I'm really interested in both sex and anthropology in general and since I've heard the religious reasons (at least one hundred times) for why sex before marriage is ""bad"" I am now trying to find the anthropological reasons.   I definitely agree with the idea of sex in marriage being a transfer of property. Growing up I heard multiple times that ""your body belongs to God until you get married and then it belongs to your spouse."" It's a bit creepy when you think about it.   Also, sorry if this is rambling and incoherent, I've been designing a curriculum for the last few hours and my brain is fried."
Anthropology,3a4gtk,Brokenshatner,4,Wed Jun 17 06:03:11 2015 UTC,"Not rambling at all, especially considering what you were replying to. But your reply did bring something else to mind for me, another thing you may want to keep in mind, when attempting to deconstruct the 'why' of religious practices.   Literalism is a pretty novel concept in Western religion, relatively speaking. It would have been easy to find Jews in a certain part of the world, 2200 years ago, who could recite long passages of the Pentateuch from memory. But it would have been much trickier to find Jews who understood it as 'Gospel'. Sure, they'd fight and die for it, but that's because it helped define who they were as an in-group, not because Ezekiel was literally true.  This is why you hear so much criticism of Christian biblical literalists from secular Jews. The OT is full of passages that begin, ""Relate to them a parable which begins..."" The Bible talks of dreams and visions and 'revealed' stories, but only rarely does it address actual history head-on.  There are the stories you tell new initiates, that they might learn what they see as THE lesson, and then there are 'mysteries' that are only apparent after closer study. Jews are aware of this practice, hiding the Story within the story. Non-theists who grew up in Jewish households are as well. But biblical literalist Christians and fundamentalist Moslems tend to lack this knowledge and see the text itself as the holy thing, rather than the lesson. (I recommend looking into 'mystery cults', as a starting point.)  You're right to be frustrated with what you call the 'religious reasons'. Oftentimes the people relating the story don't even know the author's intended purpose. It's for this reason that asking those who actually practice a religion for information about their practices can be so disappointing. If they knew why they performed the rituals, they'd also know that the performance of the ritual wasn't that important."
Anthropology,3a4gtk,AugustSprite,3,Wed Jun 17 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"I'm on the inside and I can confirm this, especially the last couple paragraphs. For example, the liturgy (worship service) is full of rich allusions evoking some theme or image that you would recognise instantly if you knew the Bible stories inside out, but I think hardly anyone 'gets' them. Roots reggae is actually a great modern example of a people sending a subversive message by referring to the 'Story withing the Story'.   ""I-man say that not even dog that piss against the wall of Babylon will survive the judgement day."" ... And here I am, sitting by the River of Babylon."

I don't know, I'm not familiar with this particular group. But I know that in other cases like this the effects have been long-lasting. The more obvious things are loss of family, loss of first language, and marginalization. Children raised this way can wind up as outsiders from their own groups because they no longer speak their mother tongue and as outsiders in the dominating group because their ethnicity marks them as different. That's the kind of thing that can stick with a person throughout their entire lives.  But it doesn't necessarily end with them either. If a person grows up like this and turns to alcoholism or drugs, or if they have anger issues, or if they're abusive - those types of behaviors can be transmitted to their own children and then that generation suffers and they might not even know what the root cause is. It's a problem that we've seen in the US (and I think in Canada) as natives who were forced into boarding schools got older and started raising their own families.   Like I said, I'm not familiar with this group and context is everything. But at the surface it seems like a pretty typical case of colonial efforts to modernize natives."

This is what happened to many Aboriginal communities in Canada, not just Nunavut and has effects today. I'm not super familiar with the context of Greenland so I don't know what it's like today. But from what I have gathered it's doing a lot better, which I can't say about the majority of Aboriginal communities in Canada, especially Nunavut which has a completely different context (no major highway, way to get food or grow it, low population over a vast amount of space -Canadian gov. lack of real role in helping.). I mean, was it really 22 children out of the entirety of Greenland? Those children were affected and I'm sure their families were too, but it was not as widespread as it was elsewhere. Like what effects does it have on the community today? I really don't know.   I'm really trying to not say ""Canada has it worse"" but I think that's what I am saying and I really apologize because I'm not trying to take away the truth of what happened to those people. I mean, it is just another case like you said of people trying to modernize natives and it's become such a mess because the Canadian, Denmark, U.S, and Australian governments for starters don't even acknowledge the truth of what they did, which makes it a lot harder to fix."

Besides the whole people dying from diseases, their land and everything was taken away. Like we've heard of people like the Mayan and the Aztec, but no one wonders what happened to them. Uh hello? The Spanish killed them (though I hear there are some left but have lost traditions and culture) and then went and destroyed a lot of their agricultural systems and waterways. Now we've got corporations going in to places like Mexico (and every other place as well) and just take things like the fresh water meanwhile the people are shit out of luck? Sorry I'm ranting.

Anthropology,39a9d9,heimaey,4,Wed Jun 10 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"Those are very very different things from projectile making. And anyway, he's right, Neanderthal spears were made for thrusting. They would have been to heavy and unbalanced to throw thanks to their large heads. Homo sapiens, however, had the atlatl and lightweight darts that could be used on smaller, faster game."
Anthropology,39a9d9,orthag,3,Wed Jun 10 21:39:50 2015 UTC,They are different but they were certainly smart enough to catch rabbits. They could have set traps. They didn't have to use their weapons or need arrows.
Anthropology,39a9d9,heimaey,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:43:25 2015 UTC,"It's not that hard to sit around for an hour or two and then throw a big rock at a rabbit as it comes out to eat some nice fresh sprouts.  Besides that, it would be easier to make a snare, and animals capable of making jewelry, fire, and tools would most likely be able to make snares. Shit, spiders and plenty of other animals, including apes like us make snares. Why wouldn't Neanderthals be able to snare rabbits?"
Anthropology,39a9d9,mexicodoug,2,Thu Jun 11 05:09:28 2015 UTC,"The question of whether Neanderthals had projectile weapons or not is pretty controversial.  Definitely no bows, but it's not at all clear that their spears were actually unbalanced as /u/orthag suggests.  They were side-shaft mounted leading people to assume that that were unbalanced, but subsequent experiments have resulted in balanced spears with that mounting system.  Doesn't mean that Neanderthal spears were balanced, but it shows that you can't rule it out either.  Other people pointed to the size of the spearheads (avoiding the term ""projectile point"" for the moment), saying that the large size and weight would have made them impossible to throw.... sure, for Homo sapiens sapiens.  Once bone studies were conducted we realized that Neanderthals were massively strong and what to us would be an unwieldly heavy projectile probably would not have been for them.  Again, not proof, but also demonstrating that the previous assumption was not a watertight assertion.  Personally /u/Kaisuke1 and /u/littleraptorarms have the most likely answers in this thread so far.    Also remember that just because we haven't found the bones yet does not mean they are not there.  Most remains don't survive for us to find and increasingly researchers are realizing that where we have been looking for Neanderthal artifacts in completely the wrong places.  We preferentially look in caves as that's where the first remains were found and that's they are best preserved.  There was an article posted here recently about the increasing number of open air sites found in Europe (more for Cro-Magnon - to use an old term - but the same applies to Neanderthals) accompanied by a realization that the cave sites reflected the minority of sites and were probably used only in times of very harsh weather... ie, not rabbit hunting time.  The idea of a food related taboo is interesting, but completely impossibly to verify.  It's interesting because a number of Native American tribes specifically avoided hunting porcupines despite them being common, easy to hunt, having lots of meat on them, and being tasty.  They kept them as emergency foods, avoiding hunting them until they really needed them, despite their abundance.  Part of this was because they're active year-round, no matter the weather, so even in the depths of winter they could be found, actually more easily in winter due to the trails they leave in the snow.  We think of taboos in the negative sense, but really a taboo just serves to guide behavior and can direct both positive and negative behavior.  It's an interesting idea that /u/mtb1443 raises, though it's definitely not a theory and would be impossible to ever take beyond the idea stage."
Anthropology,39a9d9,7LeagueBoots,2,Thu Jun 11 09:00:06 2015 UTC,"Check out Dr. April Nowell's work. There is suggestion of Neanderthals eating plenty of other smaller game like fish. Perhaps a better question should be, why should they? There is huge diversity on the planet, and it's easier to explain why they may eat something than why they wouldn't eat one of millions of species on the planet."

Meanwhile, rabbit hunting homo sapiens can't quite figure out what to do with the rabbits' feet, so they wind up on their paleo keychains alongside the mini pocket flint, mini whistle, etc, as a mini reminder of their hunting prowess.   Not long after this time, the last Neanderthals on the Iberian Peninsula vanish. Homo sapiens come across their abandoned keychains again and again, and one of them notices the neanderthal keychains always seem to lack rabbits feet. A thoughtful but harebrained homo sapiens attributes his lucky survival to the rabbit's foot on his keychain and the neanderthal's demise to the lack of one, and later tells the story around the campfire. The story spreads (and changes) along with the rabbit's foot keychain practice; in time the mini-reminder of hunting prowess and Neanderthal unluckiness references are lost, and a myriad of other anecdotal examples appear locally, with luckiness being the only common thread.   (note: this is totally speculative, and don't ask me how the keychain preceded the key by several thousand millenia years)"

The survey found the Irish also had the highest rates of people needing emergency treatment after drinking, with nearly three in every 100 drinkers requiring a medic after a session.  The UK trails Ireland, Poland, New Zealand, Brazil, Australia, and France in terms of the number of men whose drinking could be described as being ""dependent.""

The ""A"" (""Ahhh"") sound (represented by the top loop of the 3) is your energy going outward. The ""U"" (""Oooooh"") sound (represented by the bottom loop of the 3) is the energy of the cosmos coming back to you. The ""M"" sound (represented by the side loop outside the 3) is you holding that energy in. The little symbol that is a curve with a dot represents silence. So ""Aum"" is really four sounds.

Anthropology,38yg33,anossXVIII,3,Sun Jun 7 22:26:36 2015 UTC,"You say you are interested in culture and linguistics, which are two different branches within anthropology.  Typically, if one were to pursue a specialty in one or both, they would receive a BA because it's not as heavily based on STEM fields like biological anthropology is.  Both a BS and BA will require studying of (usually) three of the four fields of anthropology (cultural, linguistics, arch, biological).  Science classes can be a helpful prep for taking them.  Plus, keep in mind that in addition to your major course requirements, you will have to complete general courses which will most likely include at least a few math and science classes.  If you choose to do a BA, these intro classes will probably be all you need, whereas a BS will require a more advanced understanding of the scientific method that anthropologists use.    Deciding which best fit you all depends on what you want to do with  your degree.  In today's world, applied anthropology is growing because of the seemingly unlimited possibilities it holds.  That means that many anth students are making their degrees more tailored to their specific interests.

I went with the BSc because I'd originally thought I'd do biosci, and so had started taking all those stem prerequisite courses anyway. I'm science-minded, so it all worked out for the best. I do archaeology from an evolutionary perspective. For my students who aren't so science minded, I reccomend a BA course, but still suggest taking basic science courses. Vice versa for the sciencey students. If you are truly into linguistics and cultural anth, most programs will want you to take the BA route. BUT if you are truly science-minded, there ARE more scientific approaches to the two disciplines. However, the ""scientific"" approaches to languages aren't typically found in anthro, but rather psychology.

Anthropology,38u0sh,ZosoHobo,7,Sat Jun 6 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"Hi great question.  I study medical anthropology which is a nice mix between cultural and biological anthropology. So I think I may have some insights on how evolution/culture intersect. Your question is of course a classical question in anthropology that is not ""answred"" and probably never will be in the sense of an objective ""fact""  Anyway. I might argue that ""culture"" causes a human group to act in a particular way towards/with their given environment.  By this I mean what we eat, how we eat, how we sleep, how we dance, how we entertain ourselves, etc. So if we undrstand culture in that way, then culture would have a pretty profound impact on what happens to that human group's biology and therefore their long term evolution. So I see evolution as the product of how cultural ways of being and ways of knowing manipulates or changes biology (of course alongside evironmental conditions/changes like warming temperatures, predators, etc - which I might then add that we adapted to these pressures by changing our culture). I suppose I might say that evolution does not alter cognition in the sense that ""evolution"" is some force acting on human conciousness but it is rather that biology and culture act together in a tangled relationship which influence human evolution. (I might ask if biology and culture are actually the same thing - but we don't quite know how to talk about it that way yet).  Now absolutely long term changes in biology cause significant changes in cognition or behaviour. Example being the development of the brain, of course, but I think we need to remember that the long term changes would have happened based on various cultural ""things"" that were happening to human beings throughout our history - changing dietary habits, new ecological environments affecting how we live/make shelter/hunt etc.) Moreover, is it evolution that has caused, say for example,  many American citizens to feel a need to acquire money and economic success, or is it the systemic pressures of growing up in a society which values those things (ie aspects of culture) that create that behavioural orientation. That's not evolution making people act a certain way. For example, why does the poor person steal a loaf of bread? Is it because evolution has evolved some kind of gene and influenced that person's behaviour? The ""thief"" gene, maybe.  Or is it actually because the person is poor and hungry and that is their only way to survive as the structures of society have only provided them with that option.  Now epigenetics is of course a fascinating new way to think about how biology and culture affect each other in a symbiotic relationship.   This is me rambling away on my phone so please ask more questions so I can structure my arguments a little more."
Anthropology,38u0sh,magicsauc3,2,Sat Jun 6 23:33:00 2015 UTC,"Hi, thanks for the response. A few things. The current field of evolutionary anthropology includes three sub-fields, these include evolutionary psychology, human behavioral ecology, and cultural evolution. So I believe that current evo anthropology already has theory that significantly incorporates culture. Which you touched upon already, but can be seen in the case of pastoralists being able to digest lactase into adulthood, while other populations whoes ancestors weren't pastoralists cannot digest it. Which is pretty analogous to some of your points.  Regarding current economic behavior in American society I absolutely think they cannot be explained without reference to natural selection on human cognition. Economic success is tied to an individuals ability to successfully reproduce and raise healthy children. While the things that lead to reproductive success can vary between cultures and societies the fact that people value those things universally is a big give away in my opinion. I do think the analogy to a ""thief"" gene is quiet obfuscating. First, nowadays behavior is understood as phenotype expressed in the interaction of genes with environmental factors. So in this context of a male who has children he wants to provision, he has to weigh the costs and benefits of his provisioning strategy, which is affected by cultural societal rules. Such as, the criminal justice system, does he have alternative avenues to feed his children, like education, a job, or any other skills? The ability and automatic calculating of reproductive costs and benefits was designed by natural selection. The environments: physical, social, or cultural all play apart in altering the specific costs and benefits which in turn determine an individuals optimal behavioral strategy.   However, the resistance I usually get from others is way more hardline than any of the views you expressed. For instance, the presence of evolved mental modules is disputed. So when evo people talk about an evolved psychology that his highly perceptive to cues of fertility in mates, such as a .7 waist to hip ratio in females as a universal preference, we get lambasted. Or when we study optimal foraging behaviors in other animals and then see that the models also account for variation in hunter-gatherer foraging behaviors/strategies we get flack as well. Are you familiar with any arguments against this type of approach?"
Anthropology,38u0sh,magicsauc3,6,Sun Jun 7 00:44:34 2015 UTC,"Hi thanks for having this discussion with me.    Economic success is tied to an individuals ability to successfully reproduce and raise healthy children.   It is? Is there something in ""nature"" that tells us that ""economic success"" is related to raising healthy children? How does reproducing lead to having more money? How many children is considered healthy? What does healthy mean? The answers to these questions are entirely culturally constructed. At one point is was considered societally beneficial to have countless children, now we think that in order to be economically successful we should probably have less children. (This is a generalization of Western worldviews) What does that have to do with biology? It sounds to me that it has more to do with the complexities of a global political economy and the ways in which culture orders our potentialities as humans.   While the things that lead to reproductive success can vary between cultures and societies the fact that people value those things universally is a big give away in my opinion.   A big give away of what? And why do you think that people ""universally value"" reproductive success? Do they? How can you say that?   So in this context of a male who has children he wants to provision, he has to weigh the costs and benefits of his provisioning strategy, which is affected by cultural societal rules. Such as, the criminal justice system, does he have alternative avenues to feed his children, like education, a job, or any other skills?   Exactly: therefore depending on the circumstances of his culture, he will either live or die (or his children will) and thus be continued or eliminated in the gene pool - an example of culture affecting biology and thus having implications for long term evolution.   The ability and automatic calculating of reproductive costs and benefits was designed by natural selection. The environments: physical, social, or cultural all play apart in altering the specific costs and benefits which in turn determine an individuals optimal behavioural strategy.   I don't quite understand this part. The ability to calculate reproductive costs was created by natural selection? How so?   I notice that all of your arguments are about reproduction. Humans do more than just think about/have sex. We also have sex and think about sex in completely different ways (taboos, norms, expectations, etc.)  Why then do you argue that "" a .7 waist to hip ratio in females is a universal preference""? How could you ever test such a thing? Anecdotally I have friend who are attracted to large women, to tiny women, to short women, to tall women, to long hair, to short hair, to blonde hair, to brown hair, to ""asian phenotypes"" to ""black phenotypes"". How can we then say that ""universally"" all men are attracted to a .7 waist to hip ratio? It's almost insulting to the possible variability and heterogeneity of human sexual possibility. How do you explain the historical changes in various societies worship of particular body types? The large healthy plump body of the ancient East and the hard, stern, muscular body of ancient Greece/Rome. How about changes in the ways in which humans have been attracted to tanned skin versus pale skin (like how women would hide from the sun in the 19th/20th century to keep their skin pale - or how people in southeast Asia use ""whitening"" cream to make their skin appear white). How can we thus claim a universal truth about sexual/human bodily attraction or understanding of bodily ideals?  I hope I don't sound arrogant. I'm simply passionate and would like to think about this with you, not against you."

How does reproducing lead to having more money? How many children is considered healthy? What does healthy mean? The answers to these questions are entirely culturally constructed   Alright, well there are observations from many societies that link wealth with reproductive success. I never contended that reproducing leads to having more money, usually I'm thinking about tribally organized societies where money is not used. Also, I do not contend that the number of children produced is related to health, I was referring to the health of children produced. Since we are talking about evolutionary factors, a definition of health could relate to the individual offspring's ability to withstand environmental threats, develop, and ultimately reproduce itself.     A big give away of what? And why do you think that people ""universally value"" reproductive success? Do they? How can you say that?   I could have been more specific here. A give away of the design produced by natural selection on people's preferences. I'm saying people desire things that lead to reproductive success in their specific society, they probably don't have the exact concept of reproductive success in the same way I think of it, so of course they don't desire the concept as formulated by evolutionary science. Also, I can say that because there is literature to back it up.   Exactly: therefore depending on the circumstances of his culture, he will either live or die (or his children will) and thus be continued or eliminated in the gene pool - an example of culture affecting biology and thus having implications for long term evolution.   Yeah, I never contended that culture doesn't influence evolution, remember the lactase example?    I don't quite understand this part. The ability to calculate reproductive costs was created by natural selection? How so?    The same way any other trait becomes common; it helped those who possessed it relative to those that didn't. Part of the adaptation's usefulness is that it works in different environments, including ones where the 'culture' provides the most reproductively relevant costs and benefits.   I've been talking about mating mostly because it's relevance to evolution is pretty clear, though my personal research concerns the evolution of cooperation. I don't deny people have taboos or think about sex differently. But there has been cross cultural research where men are presented with an array of female body silhouettes of varying hip ratios and they tend to pick the .7 as most attractive. So maybe universal isn't the most clear term, in the sense that everyman would choose it, but I would certainly call it species typical for humans. Historical changes of preference in female body types could also be tracking ecological changes that in turn affect fitness and survival, though hip to waist ratios could be the same for different 'body types' I suppose. Interestingly enough preference for lighter skinned females is associated with the increased fertility during ovulation that in turn makes female faces blush and appear slightly lighter than they would be otherwise."

Anthropology,38u0sh,mishki1,3,Sun Jun 7 12:54:55 2015 UTC,"There are fairly clear historical and political reasons why this is an unpopular line of research. Historically, as you know, pseudoscientific anthropology has been used to justify racist agendas.  There is reasonable concern that if you start speculating as to differences in culture and behavior between human populations being genetic and evolved, you'll use that to justify racist policy.  Needless to say, this is a non starter in any contemporary western academic setting.  A review of discussions about international comparisons of iq test scores will show you what kind of minefields you can enter.   Besides this, it's actually from a scientific point of view incredibly difficult to link specific genes with behavior patterns, given the extremely powerful influence of culture and environmental stimulation on individual development."
Anthropology,38u0sh,Snugglerific,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:16:17 2015 UTC,"There is reasonable concern that if you start speculating as to differences in culture and behavior between human populations being genetic and evolved, you'll use that to justify racist policy   Evo psych posits that our cognitive adaptations are actually pan-human traits analogous to how our anatomical adaptations are pan-human and functionally organized in the same manner across all populations. Differences in behavior can be attributed to the differences in the relevant information of a specific domain that an adaptation utilizes, which varies in the different environments in which humans inhabit. So the theoretical position you hold as concerning for ensuring equality in policy is not an actual position held by evolutionary social scientists, but some misunderstanding of their position. In addition there would be a very difficult task of arguing out of the naturalistic fallacy if someone did think we should base policy off of evo psych theory and findings, if the theory even said that, that is.     Besides this, it's actually from a scientific point of view incredibly difficult to link specific genes with behavior patterns, given the extremely powerful influence of culture and environmental stimulation on individual development.    Also, evolutionary theory of human behavior and psychology does not posit this. Instead, we look to find functional and adaptive explanations for observed traits given the type of environment in which they would be beneficial. We are not concerned with identifying the exact genes or interaction of genes that produce behavior or cognitive patterns. This is in line with anatomy where the genes that underlie our anatomical adaptations like arms, lungs, hearts, pelvic structure, and immune system are not searched for. As you said, this is extremely difficult to do, but is not considered a weakness or critique of evolutionary theory concerning the body 'from the neck down' or in other animals. As such, it seems to be a form of special pleading to consider this a weakness of evolutionary theory in one area but not the other."
Anthropology,38u0sh,PairOfMonocles2,3,Sun Jun 7 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"I think everyone agrees that human behavior has an evolutionary basis. People's critiques of evolutionary psychology and similar approaches are more against the type of simplistic, reductionist explanations for complex social phenomena you see in evo-psych publications (that, let's face it, often reproduce the researchers' pre-existing biases more than discovering real universals of human behavior). If we assume that the main evolved element of human behavior is not a specific way of dealing with reproduction or whatever, but rather the ability to be extremely plastic and adaptable, then plasticity is our primary evolved trait, and specific cultural forms would not necessarily be expected to have any straightforward link to evolutionary processes. The diversity of cultural forms we have compared to other species show the importance of this trait, and make simple explanations based mainly on everyone wanting to increase their reproductive success seem pretty silly. Almost every evo-psych paper I read has the same problem. They establish some (usually very loose) correlation, offer up their own favored explanation for it, describe two or three alternative straw-man explanations that are mentioned only to be discarded, and then use this sleight of hand as 'proof' for their explanation. While everyone agrees in principal that there is an evolutionary basis for behavior, many people see attempts to link specific human behaviors to specific evolutionary processes as a methdological dead-end."

Anthropology,38d63j,ilovepaperdolls,19,Wed Jun 3 18:21:43 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of discussion in the archaeology world about grave accompaniments (which would include clothing) and how (and where) people are buried (or even if they are or are not buried at all), and what those things mean / signify.  There's a huge body of literature on it, actually.  In short (and very simplified, this is a huge topic)...  Some people have argued that if you find someone buried with a lot of stuff, or in expensive clothing, it means they were wealthy and it's a direct indicator of their (or their family's) socio-economic status.  This tends to depict burial practices-- and grave goods-- as pre-determined, and implies that the living who are doing the burying are pretty much just following a formula: We have X amount of money / importance, we bury our dead with Y amount of stuff / kinds of things.  This was popular in the 1970s and started to be questioned seriously by the 80s.  Others have suggested that funerals are less about the dead than they are conducted for an audience-- the other people in a social group (which could be a town, village, city, etc.).  And that it's more a performance or way of sending a message of social importance.  So a comparatively poor family might throw a lavish funeral to try to elevate themselves or look better off than they are.  There's also the factor of changing fashions, and that includes funerals and burials.  There have been periods when very plain burials, even of the very wealthy, were considered appropriate and desirable.  Some of that may have developed as a reaction to prior traditions that involved expensive funerals and the destruction of wealth by burying it with the dead.  At any rate, there's no reason why we should expect that a wealthy or important person should automatically be buried with expensive grave goods, or in expensive clothing.  Especially when a lead coffin was actually a pretty expensive way to bury someone."

I sacrifice a large amount of subject matter for detail and content, quality over quantity. While resources such as time and money are factors, many anthropologists choose to return to the same field site year after year and write many articles and books on it, expanding on knowledge gradually as they learn and grow.    I believe the wider the net the more homogeneous we make a people or culture sound. I studied a single theater in Louisiana for my fieldwork and I guarantee you my content and and analysis would be vastly different if I had chosen to study the Baton Rouge middle class at large instead (the theater was made up mostly of those who were firmly in the middle class).  My point is we don't just go study the Sherpa culture any more because we recognize there isn't just one Sherpa culture. We narrow it down and create our own little blip of information that can be shared and built upon in hopes of creating an ethnography that goes beyond what any one person can produce.  I hope that helps and makes sense."
Anthropology,389s1l,Faerook,3,Tue Jun 2 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"It certainly does make sense, and I believe that's the argument modern and post-modern anthropology taught: we need to avoid homogenizing through ethnography (or even more critically, stereotyping). However, I still see great value in creating more classical ethnographies. Who does work in Samoa without first reading Mead (however flawed)? Who studies the Trobriand Island folk without first consulting Malinowski? These seminal texts, while we recognize their flaws, and still super important. I feel as if we look at those texts and throw out the baby with the bathwater. We have learned a lot about how to conduct ethnography without situating it 'colonially', we have learned a lot about how to conduct ethnography that is less generalizing and homogenizing. I feel that a contemporary-classic ethnography that applied the lessons of the last twenty years of highly critical introspection would be invaluable. In a sense, we have these outdated and flawed encyclopedic records that need to be updated.   To follow your example, of course there is more than one Sherpa culture. So don't talk about Sherpas, but instead talked about X Sherpa group. However, we can still talk about as much about that group as possible: kinship, ritual, economy, politics, child rearing, etc. There is still value in creating these types of ethnographies in the same way there is still value in the work of dialectologists, despite the fact that socio-linguists snoot on it.   Applying ""ethnographic methods"" to research is immensely degrading to ethnography. It isn't, after all, a methodology. But that's all anthropologists (myself included!) do anymore: apply ethnographic-like methods to small sub-topics in a society."
Anthropology,389s1l,BirdsMilkCake,6,Tue Jun 2 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"I think we now realize that the broadness of previous ethnography left a lot to be desired. The perspectives of women were often ignored, and cultures were often used to prove someone's ""grand theory"" rather than studied for their own sake.   A smaller topic is more manageable, more honest, and more in tune with our understanding of theories of culture."

I've interned in a bioarchaeology lab, and there are plenty of things that stink in there WITHOUT having a pair of severed human legs mortifying under a fume hood.  One day I had to crank up the lab oven and burn bits of mummy to ash (so we could measure their isotope levels) and it was like somebody had opened Hell's BBQ.  The whole floor stank of charred bone, there's no way one little fume hood fan contained the stench from this experiment."
Anthropology,37prx0,timmy242,6,Fri May 29 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"I have one lab story that might beat yours.  One day the remains of a man, missing for 30+ years, was brought into the bioanth lab and we grad students had the opportunity to witness the examination.  The man had been partly preserved (along with most of his clothes) by the watery-muck of a river bottom, where his car had run off a bridge into.  It was the first, and only, case of human saponification that I ever want to see."

I've read of saponification and it's a fascinating process, but it's absolutely something I never want to experience first hand.  That lab oven had cremated the remains of countless dead things over the years (and they made their presence known when I fired it up) but I don't think it can rival anything that's both long-dead and juicy.  If you're ever in Minneapolis, check out the science museum.  They have a mummified chicken on display that's the result of one of the earlier attempts to recreate the mummification process.  IIRC the stench was so vile they had to relocate it from a fume hood on the U of MN campus to an outbuilding far, far away from any place frequented by humans."

I'd guess Mediterranean or Middle Eastern descent, and even if you have a few Neanderthal genes for nose size or hair thickness, they'd by now be blended in with human to the point where they're not... being expressed as outside human normal.  I'd also question why you'd only have facial/cranial features as noted here-- a big skull isn't really indicative of Neanderthal ancestry, there were a number of cranial differences like the skull being flatter and elongated and having an occipital 'bun' (humans have an external occipital protuberance, which you'll feel if you run your hands over there).

It was just a totalitarian oligarchy, with a few bandit communities on the outskirts.  Also, I don't think the human population has ever been impacted globally to nearly the degree as featured in Mad Max. Although I'm not particularly versed in anthropology, the closest one was probably the Black Death of Europe, and that only took out about half the population. And in human history, disasters that befelled a civilization tended to result in other, stronger civilizations either aiding them or taking it over, which is not an option in the Mad Max scenario."

The Mad Max saga is a frontier/post-nuclear war apocalyptic scenario, so unknown so far in human history.  But I'd suggest that there have been other mass catastrophes created by war and mass killing that would be similar - the mongol invasions, for example, created genocidal wastelands and mass migrations full of mayhem and murder.  When you think about scifi as a lens, much of our cultural history of ""conquest from the unknown"" draws from the mongol experience.   Even in places like Africa, where the state as we know it was late to arrive, there were sophisticated power centers and the hinterlands had fueding tribes, not anarchy. Statelessness isn't anarchy, as even then you have rival political orders replacing each other in the wake of atrocities.

The drop in stature pre-/early bronze age is most likely related to the dramatic drop in meat consumption combined with infectious disease resulting from a sedentary lifestyle. In addition to this, many people were probably vitamin D deficient due to drop in animal consumption. White skin may not have been as prevalent either, so vitamin d from sun may not have been sufficient. Domestic animals and the ability to digest lactose were also not as universal in Europe as it would later become.

Artistic abilities are not evenly shared across any given population (no evidence for this except observation). I think that some members of the clan would have a greater ability than others but how did they determine that? Did people do a lot of doodling around drawing with burned sticks on rocks outside the cave, doodles that weather would have long since erased, and so the best doodlers were then the ones that drew the animals in the sacred part of the cave? Was it the work of shamen? Did shamen hone drawing skills as part of being proper shamen because images had spiritual power? There were homosexual men in those days and did they often become shamen because they were considered different and so possibly sacred in some way?  Did they evince greater artistic skills than their clan brothers? Were those great cave paintings the work of (homosexual) shamen who were thought of as special kinds of people?  edit sp."

It seems a likely conclusion. She was a mother, the child was buried with her. Presumably there was a husband around. She was only 18, so she couldn't have been married very long. All her travel was confined to the previous year or two - the analysis of her hair, the fingernails. Travel to and fro between two locations, the birth of a child, all point to a recent marriage, which seems the likely cause of it all.  What I was a bit skeptical about was the claim that she was a ""sun priestess"". How do they know? The only evidence they mention is a belt buckle shaped like the sun. How do they know it wasn't a common decorative device? How do they know non-priests didn't wear it? They certainly can't have enough well preserved burials from that period to know stuff like that."

Additionally they did they're excavation based on surface scatter, so not sure what they used to date those. I'll admit my knowledge of K. platyops's post cranial morphology isn't great, but I'm curious about what is known of there wrist morphology. This has been area of debate between the argument for H. habilis vs any of the other early homonids as a the first stone tool user.

Such structures as those described in this article would have undergone gradual deterioration due to weather and natural processes of decay and rot of the wooden superstructure, and would also eventually have become infested with a variety of vermin-- insects, rats, etc.  The fastest way to destroy an unsafe structure in the age prior to heavy equipment was to burn it. This is particularly the case with large structures, to which adequate repairs may be more difficult, dangerous, or time-intensive than simply rebuilding from the ground up. And, by burning instead of the long process of dismantling such structures, significant reservoirs of vermin would also be eliminated, rather than simply relocating to other nearby structures in the settlement."

If a village was razed, it was probably by conquerors, not villagers.   The village wasn't razed.  Other articles on this describe individual houses being burned, rather than the village as a whole.  They also indicate that the houses that burned had been filled with fuel (i.e., firewood).  There's plenty of evidence of settlements that were burned as a result of conflict (both New and Old World), but this is not one of those cases.   Remember the entire conclusion of burning their own homes??? was based on a ""custom"" discovered in this one village alone. And reported by the national press, not the archeologists.   There are many examples worldwide of structures being burned and rebuilt periodically.  By later periods, when iron nails were used in construction (but were quite expensive), after the structure was burned, the nails would be recovered (NOTE: this is not to say that structures were burned for the nails, but that nails were recovered after a structure was burned after it had become unsound and needed to be rebuilt).  There's also something known as the ""Burned House Horizon.""  Here's an article that includes reference to it.  Tringham, Ruth (2005) Weaving house life and death into places: A blueprint for a hypermedia narrative. In (Un)settling the Neolithic, edited by D. Bailey, A. Whittle, and V. Cummings, pp. 98-111. Oxbow Books, Oxford. Bailey D., Whittle A., Cummings V.  http://diva.berkeley.edu/projects/tringham/RET_DigPub/RET_Unsettling_Fire.pdf   There's a lot of bologna here.   Maybe, but it seems that you're the one slinging it.  Here's a better and more detailed article on the subject.  Salient points (especially regarding your commend about the burning as a consequence of warfare / conflict):   Now the Bulgarian archaeologists claim to have found “unequivocal evidence” for this prehistoric practice even though they still cannot explain the reasons behind it. However, they have discovered that the prehistoric inhabitants did not burn down the entire settlement but instead burned down only individual homes, and at different times.  The deliberate setting on fire is proven by the fact that the houses had been filled with firewood in advance. This practice was complicated because in that period firewood was scarce in Mursalevo’s region, and the prehistoric people probably had to come together and make numerous group trips in order to harvest and bring back enough firewood, a clear indication that the burning down of the respective homes was not only deliberate but also carefully planned, explain the Bulgarian archaeologists."
Anthropology,36m1fw,deaconblues99,1 point,Thu May 21 11:28:59 2015 UTC,Still cute. The conclusions are premature and meant for the press.  Almost everything you have to say is perfectly valid. It's the force with which it's applied that's bologna. (I'm pretty sure you know it too)  There is only a need to recognize that the building were deliberately razed. There is no indication of who did the razing. The conclusion is based entirely on the fact that the structures were filled with wood. Deliberate burning is a safe conclusion; villagers burning their own homes down is not.
Anthropology,36m1fw,iMark70,0,Thu May 21 11:40:20 2015 UTC,Deliberate burning is a safe conclusion; villagers burning their own homes down is not.   Sure it is.

His books are widely read by laypeople like myself. He is an engaging writer, and his writing is accessible and extremely compelling to someone without other knowledge of the various fields he writes about. This means that when conversing with laypeople, anthropologists are constantly asked about him, with the assumption that he is like the world's leading anthropologist, because he's the only anthropologist that laypeople have ever heard of. This leads to anger and frustration, because he is not even a 'proper' anthropologist.  FWIW, my understanding is not that people think he's necessarily wrong, but that his views have gotten vastly more exposure than other, maybe better supported views, because he is a good communicator to the public, and most anthropologists are not."

The issue isn't what he suggests, but the way he draws conclusions and makes connections without any real scientific basis bothers me. He's certainly free to write his books and put his opinions forth, but they're just that: opinions, with little to no solid evidence backing them apart from the conclusions he himself draws. A great deal of progress has been made in both history and anthropology as a result of speculation, but in the end he amounts to the equivalent of those guys talking about druids on the history channel."

It didn't seem like a meandering theory out of pure air but a solidly-sourced presentation of evidence about the movement of languages and crop packages and such. I'm unable to read more than the first page of this linked article, but I don't really know what to make of the kernel of criticism that I see; Diamond greatly emphasized social domination, rather than ignoring it. The whole book was an attempt to explain why societies were able to dominate each other, while going well out of his way to rebuff racial explanations.  I'm gonna go check the faqs of some subs to see if there's a comprehensive critique of him."
Anthropology,36j3vo,grumpenprole,42,Tue May 19 20:28:45 2015 UTC,"So I just read the great number of criticisms catalogued on /r/askhistorians and honestly it seems more like they've been reading each other than GGS. The idea that Diamond has a linear view of technological development is frankly so ridiculous -- he has chapters dedicated to how societies adopt and abandon technological and cultural forms in idiosyncratic, situational ways. His claims of ""more advanced"" are explicitly not about being further along some imagined line of progression, but rather about being able, over time, to dominate other societies. And this is not some single-vector thing; bureaucratic and organizational vectors are at least as emphasized as ""technology"". Nor does he ignore singular events and people; for example, he has a bit about Shaka, which I actually found surprising because it seemed out of tune with the rest of the text and also with the (needed) de-emphasis of great-person history. Finally, he absolutely does not remove variance and cultural idiosyncrasies; again he has a whole section, focusing on New Zealand, making clear that his theories are not at all totalizing. His claim isn't that each society develops in ways strictly and completely determined by its environment, but rather that over large amounts of time, diverse and competing societies will dominate each other based on how effectively their resources are geared towards that end. It seems like a difficult idea to refute. It's not that each polity in the history of the world has a 1-to-1 correspondence with its environment, but that over time, those with surplus resources mobilized to effectively overrun other societies (in any number of ways) will do so, and that environments with certain characteristics allow for this.  Here is a very basic line of thinking you could find on any page of GGS: Any given society in any given environment makes a decision between hunting-gathering, food production, or some hybrid between them. In some environments, food production will be enormously resource-efficient, giving polities that adopt it enormous advantage over those which don't. In other environments, food production is not particularly feasible. In the environments where food production confers a great advantage, given a large amount of time and a number of competing societies to iron out idiosyncrasies, that food production package will spread to nearby areas with similar climates -- through conquest, migration, trade, whatever.  What is so objectionable? That's the kernel of the whole book right there."
Anthropology,36j3vo,dasheea,3,Tue May 19 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been reading a handful of the linked criticisms here and in the article, and I've yet to read one that doesn't inform us at length that he isn't a trained anthropologist/has bad evidence/cites discredited theories, - though few of them seem to actually point to bad evidence or discredited theories he cited that actually undermine his main argument. Seems a lot like in professional circles he has become persona non grata to the point where his work is simply dismissed. I guess it has been a good chunk of time since it was published and those discussions have all been had already, but it is definitely a frustrating tone to deal with as an outsider.   I never read GGS as the ""bible"" of anthropology, nor did I suspect that anthropology was any less complex and constantly changing than any other field of science. But as a scientist in another field I have to respect how much research JD did, and how thorough his exploration of the topic and support for his theory was compared to other pop science writers, regardless of whether he's a card-carrying member of the Trained Anthropologists Club.  He made a (too rare) attempt to draw evidence from multiple disciplines together, and he took the time to go into great detail at every step of his argument, a difficult task which inevitably resulted in an imperfect work with lots of holes and oversimplifications. He never claimed to be giving the final word on all human history, and I certainly hope no one read him that way. But frankly if the best his critics can come up with is ""every professor in my anthropology department thinks he's wrong"" I'm not convinced his work has no merit."

Anthropology,36j3vo,grumpenprole,2,Wed May 20 15:39:03 2015 UTC,"I  Replying to an old-ish post, but I've tried to follow the GGS debate whenever it appears on Reddit, along with all the previous links that usually get posted, and I just want to advise people to always read the rebuttals against the ""mainstream historical/anthropological academic opinion"" that exist in these debates.  I've always found those rebuttals to be quite strong, able to slow or even stop what seems to be a historical/anthropological onslaught against Diamond.    Often, the main attack against Diamond ends up repeating 1) the refrain about human agency, 2) ""it's just so much more complex"" (as if that alone could ever be a satisfying answer to an academic question), or 3) something about ""his specific assumptions are wrong, so his main argument falls apart like a house of cards.""    The first (the refrain about human agency) is just like, your opinion, man.  We should all be able to agree that the course of history depends on both human agency and environmental factors.  How much on each?  Whatever it is, that's just your opinion, unless you can bring research and evidence that weighs them against each other.  You say Diamond doesn't give enough to human agency while Diamond says you don't give enough to the environment.  Diamond spends 425 pages (in the copy I have) talking about the environment.  How many more pages would he have needed to incorporate human agency?  But... why would you even require him to do that?  He's not a historian and human agency is not the thrust of this argument, and there's a whole field of history that already does focus on human agency.  Even if we can assume that the average, acclaimed history book may incorporate more about the environment than Diamond does to human agency (i.e., let's assume that academic history is more balanced in this human agency vs. environment discussion than Diamond is), what's important is the scale of history we're talking about here.  In ""microhistory,"" like why was it England that dominated imperialism and not, say, Germany, in the 1800's, that depends on microhistory and thus a lot more human agency (government, population policies, military policies, etc.).  But Diamond deals with ""macrohistory,"" which is Yali's question, ""Why do you have cargo and I don't?""  Diamond's thesis reformulates this into ""Why Eurasia and not the rest.""  When you're talking about something as huge as Eurasia vs. Africa vs. the Americas vs. Oceania, you almost can't talk about human agency.  You can't compare the human agency of Europeans, Middle Easterners, and Chinese over 10,000 years vs. the human agency of Native Americans over 10,000 years.  This is why GGS if so focused on something that is not about human agency, because it's so macro.  And I have to repeat what a lot of rebutters say, which is that GGS is about how Europeans (or a Eurasian society) came to dominate others, not why.  The why does need human agency answers.  But the how is kinda like asking ""What were the tools that enabled Europeans to dominate others?""  Well, they are guns, germs, and steel.  The Chinese had guns, germs, and steel as well.  Human agency can explain why Europeans and not Chinese.  But GGS's argument is that human agency doesn't explain why Europeans and Chinese had these tools but the Native Americans didn't.  GGS's environmental argument tries to answer that question, as well as (obviously) the converse: why didn't the Native Americans invade Europe or China?  Diamond's answer is because they didn't have guns, germs, and steel.  In other words, in order to invade someone, you need two things: 1) Guns, germs, and steel, and 2) the human agency to do it.  It's a simplification, but basically, China had 1) but not 2), while Europe had both 1) and 2), and Native Americans did not have 1).  Diamond's mission is to explain the having and not having of 1), not of 2).  He can leave that to historians that deal with history that is more ""micro.""    The second refrain of the ""mainstream"" anti-GGS argument that I listed is the ""it's just so much more complex"" thing.  I think this has to do with a certain ideology within the field of history (I feel like it should be less so in anthropology), and I actually think it's a good thing for history in general, but perhaps there's too much of it in this discussion; and that ideology is: to avoid determinism and questions that deal with determinism like ""what if?"" questions.  I think it's a good thing in general because history is an ongoing thing with a sample size of 1 (no experimentation possible) and overly general statements about history can be easily misused for bad political purposes.  The academic field of history tries to avoid these landmines by being descriptive and not prescriptive.  Which is why I think political science, economics, psychology - fields like that - are probably much more amenable to GGS, since these fields are not shy of trying to reduce human history to models and numbers.  Which is why I've been surprised at the anti-GGS-ness of anthropology, since I thought anthropology would lie somewhere in between history and the social science fields I listed above since it deals with things like evolution and biology of humans, crops, and environments.  In any case, I do think it's an ideological issue here.    The third refrain is ""his specific assumptions are wrong, so his main argument falls apart like a house of cards.""  That kind of claim actually needs evidence.  I could equally say that errors in some of his specific assumptions - as long as it isn't every single one of his specific assumptions - don't undermine his main argument.  His main argument is that the macro effect of all of these things gives Eurasia a huge advantage in giving its societies the tools that could allow it to dominate non-Eurasian societies, should they meet.  If Diamond brings up 50 examples (crops, trade axis, germs, domesticable animals, whatever) and 5 of them are demonstrably wrong, his main argument still has 45 valid examples.  It's not a house of cards.    Continued."
Anthropology,36j3vo,dasheea,2,Mon Jun 1 06:46:10 2015 UTC,"II  I do want to bring up two things that I think are valid criticisms of GGS.  One is this:    First, although he is generally quite appreciative about Diamond’s approach, McNeill comments that it is probably not so surprising to see the most formidable societies arising in Eurasia:   The fact that Eurasia spawned the world’s most formidable societies does not pose a truly vexing question. Eurasia accounted for some eighty percent of humankind over the past 3,000 years, and probably well before that. Even if formidability were randomly distributed, one would expect to find it more often in Eurasian societies than elsewhere. Indeed because greater population ordinarily means greater interaction, more intense intersocietal competition, and the faster and more thorough acquisition of a broader array of disease immunities, the probability would be even higher than eighty percent that Eurasia should at any given moment have produced history’s most formidable societies. The deck was stacked even without Diamond’s biogeographical factors. So Diamond has proposed some excellent new answers to a less-than-perplexing question.   Then McNeill goes on to ask “a more vexing question, and one more familiar to historians is, why Europe?” and investigates Diamond’s answer in Guns, Germs, and Steel. McNeill contends “that Europe’s emergence in modern centuries cannot be put down to geography” and states that Diamond has oversold geography as a substitute for history   The thing about ""Eurasia having the advantage is 'duh' because it's the biggest landmass"" is, I think, a valid criticism.  It still shouldn't invalidate all the research that Diamond did, since it enhances the understanding of why a large landmass should have these advantages.  But I still acknowledge that criticism.  The thing is, of course, that this criticism is as ""environmentally deterministic"" as Diamond's thesis.  If you agree that ""Duh, Eurasia has the most advanced societies because it's the largest,"" you're as environmentally deterministic as Diamond by agreeing that geography determined where the world's most advanced and powerful societies ended up (at least until modern technology has started to bridge some of these previously unbridgeable gaps).  The second thing I want to bring up is what was my first and immediate - as in, I had this criticism as I was reading GGS - criticism against GGS, which is Diamond's ""Why Europe, not China"" argument.  This is about why one society after the 1500s dominated the world while another didn't, and it attempts to divide Eurasia up.  I think this is Diamond's weakest theory and approaches garbage.  I like his theory about the Eurasian east-west axis and about domesticable crops and animals, but ""Why Europe, not China"" is way too flimsy especially because it doesn't (and can't) incorporate those aforementioned Eurasian arguments.  If ""just the right amount of geographic barriers"" enabled Europe to be dominant, then why didn't non-Western European states (like European states to the east of France and Germany), or Persia, or South Asia or Southeast Asia, etc. dominate?  It's a ""just so"" argument, and it's no good to me.    But the mainstream opinion attacks this thesis relentlessly as if it is a fatal flaw of Diamond that means that he's obviously a racist or something.  First of all, as is repeated, Diamond's brand of environmental determinism is not racist because he's saying that your environment strongly determines how advanced in general your society will become, not your race.  Second of all, Diamond's book (the copy I have) is 425 pages.  His ""Why Europe and not the rest of Eurasia"" argument starts in his epilogue on page 409 and ends on page 417.  This is another reason why I personally have been kind to Diamond on this problem - he left to ponder on it basically after writing most of his book.  In terms of the number of pages and amount of good evidence devoted to an argument, the ""Why Europe and not the rest of Eurasia"" debate is an afterthought in GGS.  It's a bonus discussion.  It's weak and fanciful, but in GGS's defense, it can be (and IMO should be) easily separated from the rest of GGS, which is about ""Why Eurasia and not the rest.""    In the section titled ""2003 AFTERWORD: Guns, Germs, and Steel Today"", Diamond writes:    However, the biggest advances building on GGS have involved extensions into areas that were not the book’s main focus. Since publication, thousands of people have written, phoned, e-mailed, or buttonholed me to tell me of parallels or contrasts that they noticed between the ancient continental processes of GGS and the modern or recent processes that they study. I’ll tell you about four of these revelations: briefly, the illuminating example of New Zealand’s Musket Wars; the perennial question “Why Europe, not China?” in more detail, parallels between competition in the ancient world and in the modern business world; and GGS’s relevance to why some societies today are rich while others are poor.   ...   A SECOND AREA of active discussion since 1997 falls under a heading that could be termed “Why Europe, not China?” Most of GGS concerned differences between continents: i.e., the question of why some Eurasians rather than Aboriginal Australians, sub-Saharan Africans, or Native Americans were the ones to expand over the world within the past millennium. However, I realized that many readers would also wonder “Why, among Eurasians, was it Europeans rather than Chinese or some other group that expanded?” I knew that my readers would not let me get away with concluding GGS without saying anything about this obvious question.  Hence I briefly considered it in the book’s epilogue...   He continues with a description of that debate, etc. etc.  I still stand by what I said, that I don't agree with Diamond's side of this debate, but my ""defense"" of GGS is that this really isn't GGS's main thrust.  GGS can stand fine on its own with its epilogue cut out.    III  People have often recommended Alfred Crosby's Ecological Imperialism as something ""better and already done.""  I'm repeating someone else's argument first, which is that just because it was already done doesn't mean that it can't be done again as long as there's something new in the content or the approach.  Given the diverging opinions of GGS and Ecological Imperialism (Disclosure: I haven't read Ecological Imperialism), I think it's obvious that Diamond did bring something new in content (arguing more strongly and specifically for environmental factors) and approach (more pop and accessible).  But what I really wanted to add here is Crosby's opinion himself of GGS.  Here's his praise right in the jacket of GGS:   “[Jared Diamond] is broadly erudite, writes in a style that pleasantly expresses scientific concepts in vernacular American English, and deals almost exclusively in questions that should interest everyone concerned about how humanity has developed…. [He] has done us all a great favor by supplying a rock-solid alternative to the racist answer…. A wonderfully interesting book.”   and here's a direct link to Crosby's full review of GGS, where he's generally quite positive."

Here and here (which links to the first link) is one of the more if not most daunting debates I've seen about GGS, as it gets pretty technical.

Anthropology,36j3vo,archaeofieldtech,-5,Mon Jun 1 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"Jared Diamond is attempting to create a Grand Unifying Theory of Anthropology, despite the fact that he is not an anthropologist. It is a problem that he is not an anthropologist because, as other people have mentioned he cherry picks his data and information. If he had formal training as an anthropologist presumably he would not do this. However, as other people commenting here have noted, Diamond is a popular science writer. Diamond's scientific work is concentrated on birds, but he writes popularly about human societies presumably because he enjoys to and is monetarily successful as a result. Just because the books he writes about human societies are easy to read does not mean that they have a strong scientific background or that they are right."

There are 2 primary beefs I've seen leveled against him by anthropologists:  1: Diamond rarely cites anthropologists. Instead, he tends to cite historians or biologists, and this really seems to grate a huge majority in the profession the wrong way. IMO, this is a merited complaint, but it is often hyper-fixated upon by egotistical anthropologists who are pushing for greater recognition for their field--quite the contradiction considering Diamond exposes a lot of people to the idea of anthropology in the first place.  2: Especially in his most recent book, he romanticizes the notion of ""the native"" without adequate exposition that modern ""natives"" live in hugely modified and constricted environments.  At best, this marginalizes various peoples' cultural evolution. At its worst, it can carry a current of racist undertones."

I would say he's just a bit naive and patronizing in a way that makes me cringe.  Kind of like when my grandfather says whites are better at managing their time because they had to plant crops in distinct seasons.  Apart from slighting the anthropologists, I also get the sense that he really doesn't understand political history to any depth.  Personally, I suspect what gave the Europeans vast empires was mostly command of the sea (which was a reaction to a Muslim stranglehold on the silk road), and the monopoly of global trade networks that afforded, not their plague hardened DNA or their muscular brain power, having overcome the challenges by how to ground wheat, as Diamond absurdly suggests.  His arguments really hearken back to colonial racial superiority arguments used as misdirection when justifying the inequitable treatment that any monopolist is bound to apply."
Anthropology,36j3vo,grumpenprole,2,Wed May 20 06:21:06 2015 UTC,"Could you cite those claims by Diamond? They are diametrically opposed to his repeated refrains throughout GGS, where he greatly emphasizes that biological differences between peoples are absolutely not an explanation for any historical development whatsoever. Unless by ""plague hardened DNA"" you mean their tendency to spread diseases they themselves are resistant to, which is not racism I don't think.  Also I don't see how the theories you're putting forth are in any way shape or form against Jared Diamond and his claims; he would likely wholeheartedly agree with you about the command of the seas and the monopoly on global trade networks. The idea though is that those are more proximate factors than what he's focused on; there are reasons that Europeans were able to command the seas, not racial reasons but the availability of highly efficient crop packages, draft animals, certain bureaucratic and organizational development, etc... This is just history. You don't need a racial explanation of European hegemony to acknowledge the reality and history of European hegemony, as I'm sure you're aware."
Anthropology,36j3vo,flintyeye,2,Wed May 20 15:49:39 2015 UTC,"Firstly, it was political circumstances that gave the Europeans what you call 'hegemony', nothing more.  A coincidence of time and geography.  Also, what you and Diamond would call European hegemony was not simply each team playing the game and one team winning.  There is something wholly created from green fields here - the world's first globalized economy organized quite consciously along racial lines, where each race had its place and its own speciality.  With regards to Australia and the Americas, the European powers took a Terra Nullius tact.  Saying everyone died of disease is very convenient until you read about the pains the Europeans went through to cleanse the lands of the original inhabitants.  In South Africa, they claimed that Whites and Africans reached the country at the same time."
Anthropology,36j3vo,grumpenprole,1 point,Wed May 20 19:51:56 2015 UTC,"None of this is remotely counter to anything I've read by Diamond. ""A coincidence of time and geography"" might as well be the title of GGS. Your post might as well be found on any page of GGS. ""Everyone died of disease"" would be a historical interpretation extremely counter to Diamond's; GGS doubles as a survey of the myriad ways societies come to dominate one another. Disease was a major factor in some of these, not the defining factor of all of them."
Anthropology,36j3vo,grumpenprole,2,Sat May 30 19:27:34 2015 UTC,"Could you cite...   I probably shouldn't have said 'brain power'.  I don't think he ever says Europeans are genetically superior, just that they have developed better skills than everyone else.  I fundamentally disagree with Diamond - humans have an astounding plasticity when it comes to doing what need to be done.  The Europeans were put in a position where they had to develop a global maritime economy, and they did so very quickly.  Had the Mexica been placed under similar pressures first, the world would certainly be a different place."
Anthropology,36j3vo,Trollaatori,1 point,Wed May 20 20:02:02 2015 UTC,"That is not even slightly counter to Diamond. It is wholly in tune with what he is saying. His is an investigation of how environmental factors influence social realities behind such pressures. It's about why the Mexica weren't placed under similar pressures first.  Also, if humans have an astounding plasticity when it comes to doing what needs to be done, it follows that larger groups of humans will tend to do so faster. With exactly this explicitly in mind, Diamond investigates environmental factors behind the development of high-population societies, and also puts forth the idea that large contiguous areas of similar climate (like eurasia's long east-west axis, but not the america's north-south axis) produce societies in contact with each other and trying to solve similar problems and competing and/or cooperating towards that end, something which is wholly held up by the historical record; the various urban populations across the Americas had basically no contact with each other, due to the north mexican desert, panama, and similar environmental limitations, whereas eurasia had consistent heavy-duty east-west trade and contact over comparable or even much larger distances.

Anthropology,36j3vo,FaufiffonFec,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"(which was a reaction to a Muslim stranglehold on the silk road),   The Muslim ""stranglehold"" of the silk road began in the 700s while European exploration started in the 1300s and 1400s. So it explains nothing, certainly nothing alone.  European geography was vital to European maritime dominance. The interior seas, rivers and hard Atlantic ocean, helped to shape a strong European tradition of seamanship. This combined with emergent new commercial institutions, including joint-stock companies, which were uniquely European, and increasingly better protected property rights, allowed private ships to grow ever larger. Private European merchants and enterprises could accumulate the capital and skill to produce ever larger ships, because they could draw upon the resources of hundreds of shareholders. This pool of ship building and seaman skill then provided a powerful military naval capacity to European states, which Asian states could not compete with.  This development is absolutely tied with European geography, very closely actually. Unlike the Middle East and China, Europe wasn't regularly conquered by vast nomadic empires, which forced together the large parts of Asia into inefficient and corrupt empires. Europe was bestrewn with fortifications, which enabled smaller, more efficient states.   In premodern times, the larger your state was, the more it lost to waste and corruption: tax farmer abuse destroyed long term investments. This is because no one had any actual monitoring technology, which they could use to observe their state officials. And also, the monarchs of large empires typically promoted laws that weakened local capital accumulation in order to prevent political competition to the central government, and they almost never accepted any petitions. European and Japanese monarchies operated very differently: they accepted petitions, effectively reined in tax farmers and promoted local political authorities."

In the first chapter he writes about Easter Island and describes how they committed ""eco-cide"" (eventually resorting to cannibalism).  It only took me about a day of reading the original captains' logs (first European captains to the island, over about 100 years) to determine that it was the disease and slavery that wiped out the Rapa Nui, not their own over exploitation of the island's resources. Even the stories of cannibalism were isolated to a single Catholic priest's letters, which I believe were written even before he arrived there.  His obvious bias and leading of the reader meant I could never trust his work academically again."

Roggeveen (likely the first European captain to visit in 1722) referred to the island as ""outstandingly fruitful...although devoid of large trees and livestock, apart from fowls, so this land, because of its rich earth and good climate, could be made into an earthly Paradise if it was properly cultivated and worked, which at present is done only to the extent that the inhabitants are required for maintenance of life.""  James Cook, more than 50 years later, refers to sweet potato, plantain, and sugar-cane plantations and peacefully meeting with the chief of the island. Again, no sign of societal collapse.  The real disaster and collapse for Rapa Nui occurs when Peru outlawed the taking of African slaves in the 1860s.  ""Blackbirders"" (slave traders) just found a non-African source and tricked many Rapa Nui into indentured servitude.  Most of these individuals appear to have died from disease while in Peru.  Those that made it back, infected the remainder of the population.  By 1877, only 111 inhabitants remained on the island and these were enslaved by a single land-owner (who was later murdered by his slaves, karma abounds...).  This was the collapse of Rapa Nui."

On one hand I see that she's trying to emphasise that there isn't a certain ""tribal"" people that live far away in the jungle, opposed to ""normal"" people that live in Manhattan. But still it's just continuing with the stupid trope that anthropology is, at its core, about weird other people. That annoyed me a lot.  I found it confusing how she talked about stratification and status. For example:   The more stratified and hierarchical the society, and the more sex segregated, the lower the status of women.   But then:   women who contribute to the group or family’s well-being are empowered relative to those in societies where women do not.   Initially, I read this as contradicting what she'd said earlier about status. Because she'd been explaining just how women contribute to their family's well-being, investing their time and energy in raising kids, getting them into the right schools, positioning them properly, and so on. But upon reading it again, it seems she's again implying that because they aren't bringing home the money, they aren't empowered like Hadza women are. It just seems like she didn't think this through.   Also, it does seem to be overlooking the fact that, even if they're not ""bringing home the money"", they do have legal rights to their husbands' assets, and I'm sure they all have really carefully crafted pre-nuptial agreements to that effect. For example it would have been interesting to see how many of them had their own pre-nup lawyer. And from another point of view, one might say that they do earn their money. If they're allotted a certain amount based on their performance at certain tasks, how is that so different from actually being their husband's employee? I'd like to see what this author makes of that relationship.  It doesn't seem even remotely rigourous either, but whatever, general audience and all.

Anthropology,360ys0,monsunland,12,Fri May 15 07:17:56 2015 UTC,"The extrapolation of prehistoric human social organisation from observations of contemporary hunter-gatherers is, as others have pointed out, junk anthropology.  However, the authors of the paper don't actually make this extrapolation. Here is a break down of the abstract of the actual paper:   The social organization of mobile hunter-gatherers has several derived features, including low within-camp relatedness and fluid meta-groups.   This is an observation of cross-cultural trends found in study of contemporary H-Gs.   Although these features have been proposed to have provided the selective context for the evolution of human hypercooperation and cumulative culture, how such a distinctive social system may have emerged remains unclear.   This is the hypothesis: we suggest that early human social organisation may have had similar features, and may have influenced human evolution of certain cognitive capacities during this period. However, the link between the social organisation and the evolved cognitive traits is unclear.   We present an agent-based model suggesting that, even if all individuals in a community seek to live with as many kin as possible, within-camp relatedness is reduced if men and women have equal influence in selecting camp members.   They did a computer model simulating behaviour which approximates human propensities for bonding with other humans, and found that the feature ""within-camp relatedness"" is reduced to the level one would expect (given the contemporary studies of this feature within H-G societies) when men and women have equal influence over who they select to bond with.   Our model closely approximates observed patterns of co-residence among Agta and Mbendjele BaYaka hunter-gatherers. Our results suggest that pair-bonding and increased sex egalitarianism in human evolutionary history may have had a transformative effect on human social organisation.   Belt and braces - they then compared their model to two contemporary societies, and found similarities. Finally, this is offered as a possible explanation for the problem mentioned above, essentially saying that one of the many reasons that humans began to evolve higher-level social cognition and live in increasingly complex societies may have been due to a a form of social relatedness in which selection of camp members was not a process dominated by one sex.  Needless to say, the reporting of this paper is absolute garbage, removing all of the nuances and caveats from the paper and hamfistedly pursuing a particular agenda.  What is most irritating is that UCL currently has a large number of scholars working on these kinds of projects, and slowly building a convincing picture of a highly egalitarian (even communistic) human prehistory. Take a look at David Wengrow's work if you are interested."

Are you saying this picture is wrong? These societies might not be completely ""egalitarian"" in the sense we as a Western society understand egalitarianism, but from all I've studied about contemporary hunter-gatherer societies myself, most (not all, though) certainly seem to have more social equality than the traditional agriculture-based civilizations."

Anthropology,360ys0,Protopologist,0,Mon May 18 20:58:27 2015 UTC,"So if I understand what you're saying, their presumption is that if males had a disproportionate influence in group composition, then their inclination would be to band with brothers and cousins and uncles and other males related to them, while women would be less related to each other because they have less say regarding group composition.  You say they made a computer model of what group composition would look like under either condition, and find that for at least the two modern tribes they studied, it matches the egalitarian model where both men and women have equal say about group composition.  But I have a couple of questions:  First, what was group size in the distant past, and how does it compare to group size today? If you go by their model, you assume a large group size where it's at least possible to have clans of related males - several brothers, cousins, uncles, whatever - band together.  But what if group size in the past was much smaller, like 4-10 people? In that case, you don't have the possibility for such banding together, you basically have a male/female pair, their kids, maybe a couple assorted grandparents or a miscellaneous aunt or uncle. The group is too small to have such coalitions of related males.  In fact, there is a lot of evidence that groups were pretty small in the distant past. Evidence of the earliest dwellings (which were basically lean-to shelters for people to spend a few days before moving on to forage the next spot), tend to be pretty small. Early campsites also seem quite small. If they represent group size, then group size must have been pretty small too.  So what happens to their computer model when they change group size and make it smaller?  Second, modern hunter gatherers live in extremely contracted ranges. Basically, all land that was useful for farming or any other use that could support large numbers of people, was taken away. Hunter gatherers were forced into ever smaller ranges, mostly land that nobody else wanted. This could have produced societal changes. If you squeeze people together, might they not set up stronger safeguards against inbreeding or consanguinity? A less-related group could be one such safeguard. Less-related among both males and females.  Also, you say they aren't extrapolating from modern hunter gatherer societies, and technically that is true. But doesn't it amount to the same thing? They are choosing between two hypothesis by modeling them on the computer to see what the results might look like. Then they point to two modern hunter gatherer societies and say ""one of our hypotheses produces results that look like this, therefore this must have been the ancestral condition"".  Where is the difference? I can build any number of hypotheses, but if my method of selecting the ""best"" one is to say that it produces results that most closely resemble these two modern hunter gatherer tribes, then I am in fact using these modern hunter gatherer societies as proxies to the past."
Anthropology,360ys0,EvanRWT,1 point,Fri May 15 14:15:53 2015 UTC,"You have a number of very good questions.  Just to slightly correct your interpretation of what I think the authors have claimed:  They don't really make any argument at the gender balance in group composition, just their relatedness. So they are arguing that if either females or males (though most likely males) began to exert more political power over who got to be 'in-group', the tendency was to stick with people who you were related to, regardless of gender. In practice, this may be pointing to a scenario where a dominant patriarchy expands control over the reproductive capacity of women in their band by, for instance, limiting outsiders marrying in to their band. When they say:   within-camp relatedness is reduced if men and women have equal influence in selecting camp members   they are suggesting that men and women would all actually to prefer to find out-group mates, and that the above scenario only exists where a few men have said, hey, we want to have more power over everyone in our group, so we decide who you marry (again, this is entirely speculative).  As for your questions, you are right that the authors are talking about a period of early human history where social organisation was probably tending towards groups sizes above the numbers in which endogamous mating would lead to genetic problems. This is not a particularly early phase in the evolutionary development of humans, but my understanding of recent archaeological findings of the sizes of later pre-agricultrual society suggests that nomadic bands existed in dominant numbers (as simpered to settled farmers) far longer than was previously thought, and that many 'settled' communities may actually have only been so for intermittent periods. Early extra-familial groups were probably both reasonably large and nomadic. The authors don't answer your question for very small group sizes, but I would suggest that the relatedness metric becomes a bit redundant at that scale, for the reasons you suggest.  Second, this is an excellent point, and offers a very good reasoning behind your following critique. I would only add that there are two very different historical ranges at play here, in that most of the historical marginalisation of H-Gs that you mention has occurred in a period that is evolutionarily insignificant to the kinds of cognitive effects the authors are talking about. However, as a social-cultural anthropologist, I am much more inclined to your explanations for the particular features they highlight in the Agta and Mbendjele BaYaka.  And, consequently, I think you are right, that they are pretty much doing this kind of extrapolation. However, there is a small but important difference between saying, ""the contemporary Agta are x, so therefore all early humans were x"", and ""our archaeological data about early humans very vaguely suggests x, and the Agta, who (because they possess some aspects of social organisation, political economy, and institutions that we think early humans might have had) are the nearest approximation to early humans that we can see in the contemporary world also have something like x, it strengthens our conclusions from the archaeological data"".  In conclusion, archaeology requires a bit of suspension of disbelief sometimes."
Anthropology,360ys0,Protopologist,2,Mon May 18 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"Just to slightly correct your interpretation of what I think the authors have claimed: They don't really make any argument at the gender balance in group composition, just their relatedness.   How is this correcting my interpretation? I never addressed gender balance at all, only gender relatedness.  I simply explored the mechanics of their assumption. If men were in control, then the means of control is to have allies, and blood relatives make natural allies. We know this well enough in anthropology - for example, the status of women in matrilocal societies is improved because women continue to live with relatives they grew up with.  If men had political power then it was also because they had support, the support of close blood relatives - brothers, cousins, uncles. And the way to maintain power is to continue to have that support. This is why we would expect to see more relatedness among men. It has no effect on marrying the outgroup, because they could acquire wives from neighboring tribes through conquest or capture or trade or exchange, or whatever means they had. The women, having less control, would be unable to band together as the men did for support. So you would expect to find more relatedness among men and less among women, which is precisely what they went looking for.  This is not different from their assumption, it's just another way of looking at it. You can frame it in terms of ""both men and women wanting to marry the outgroup"" or you can frame it in terms of what keeps this from happening - they are two sides of the same coin.   but my understanding of recent archaeological findings of the sizes of later pre-agricultrual society suggests that nomadic bands existed in dominant numbers (as simpered to settled farmers) far longer than was previously thought   Certainly they existed, but I am very doubtful about ""dominant numbers"". Most actual research I've read is unspecific about numbers, but most of the reports of large groups of roving bands come from very very specific sites, generally areas that were especially rich in resources. Some coastal areas and rivers, where there were multiple sources of food. This is certainly not the ""dominant"" mode.  The greater number of studies in fact favor situations such as this recent report which appeared on /r/anthropology only a couple days ago. Pre-agriculture Denmark, 12,000 years ago, with evidence of small nuclear families rather than large roving bands.   I would only add that there are two very different historical ranges at play here, in that most of the historical marginalisation of H-Gs that you mention has occurred in a period that is evolutionarily insignificant to the kinds of cognitive effects the authors are talking about.   First, how on earth would we know this? If a tribe lives in a poor habitat today, it does not mean that once upon a time before it was marginalized, it lived on rich ground. It could easily be that other tribes lived on the rich ground nearby, but their land was valuable and was taken by farmers or others and they were exterminated (or absorbed), while the tribe that lived on marginal land was unmolested precisely because no one wanted their land. This is true for many Kalahari people as well as some pygmy tribes. There is no indication they were marginalized recently, they were always marginalized (by other tribes in the past). This is why they are so specialized, being able to extract a living even from such marginal land. Such specialization probably didn't suddenly emerge in historical times, it probably has a much longer history.  Second, if we accept your premise that this marginalization is recent, then doesn't it prove the exact opposite of what you're saying? If they were marginalized recently, then they haven't been living their current lifestyle for very long, in fact, certainly not long in ""evolutionary"" terms. How could you then argue that their current behaviors or group composition are long and continuous enough for them to be evolutionarily ""fixed""? You just argued the exact opposite.   In conclusion, archaeology requires a bit of suspension of disbelief sometimes.   Sorry, it never has and never will to me. Just because there are uncertainties in the past, I don't have to resort to faith. I am perfectly happy living with uncertainties."

Native American groups were every bit as socially evolved as the Europeans they were meeting. They weren't innocent savages living in an egalitarian utopia.

They, like many societies, had distinct spheres of public and private life assigned to men and women. Women had certain roles and responsibilities and powers, both public and private, and men had others. This is not really that different from contemporary European societies; the difference is more a matter of the content of the spheres, not their existence. Understanding the status of women through suffrage is, as others have said, inappropriate insofar as it applies a modern, western standard to a pre-modern society. Both the symbolic and pragmatic value of the vote in no way resembled its value to us.  Also, I don't have a citation handy for this, but I would bet that Europeans were also pretty fucking aghast at their 'fondness for rape.'    ( The Europeans were the ones who couldn't manage their resources or their religions and who had to expand.)   The Mayan collapse is a well known rebuttal to this, but people who idealize pre-contact societies seem to think the platonic noble savage that exists in their imagination never ventured south of the Rio Grande.

Most of the ceremonies in our own culture are so deeply integrated within our daily lives that they become commonplace.   I had to say the pledge of allegiance every single day from the time I started school until about 8th grade. It was then that I gained some perspective and learned I didn't have to stand for the pledge. Didn't do it at all through high school.

Anthropology,35z4ds,JackHerer33,1 point,Thu May 14 21:49:16 2015 UTC,"Baptism can be considered a rite of passage. In a rite of passage, an individual moves from one social position to another, with a stage in the middle (the liminal stage) where they are of ambiguous or no social status. Such rites of passage are often described in terms of death and birth (or life), which is also apparent in baptism. 'Baptism' comes from the Greek, 'baptizo' which means to wash and cleanse, and has connotations with drowning, and, therefore, death. You will also sometimes hear Christians describing baptism as a symbol of 'dying with Christ', and relatedly, becoming a Christian is frequently thought of as being 'born again'.  Unlike a lot of rites of passage however, baptism does not display any apparent embarrassment or humiliation of the initiate, whereas the likes of Stag parties, Club initiations, and even Fresher's Week (This one is debatable, and I'm not even sure it's a thing in America) all feature animal-esque degradation of those going through the process.  So in answer to your question, to find rituals similar to baptism in Western culture, simply look for rituals which mark people as going from one social position to another. This can include: Weddings, Graduation, Stag/Hen parties, Sports club initiations etc."

Anthropology,35zdta,another_matt,1 point,Fri May 15 11:33:43 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, I think I overthunk it. The technology Europe had over Africa beyond gun powder and better ships was better coordination. Maybe it was the long evolution of Beaureaucracy. Britain around that time was lining hulls of ships with pure copper, no one was doing that. The Chinese had the same long history of beauraucracy and literacy and they had a similar outlier level skill in their navy. In Africa, outside of Empires, people just banded together loosely and subsisted. No giant armies were ever formed to subjugate them into being citizens. They had nothing with as much authority over them as a government. It ended at community. Working with your immediate neighbours. Power was with the oldest people. Councils of elders they're called. However it was, a particularly virulent disease could have wiped them out in the blink of an eye. Maybe that's how we evolved such complex brains as opposed to remaining the first things that could gang up and poke everything with sharpened sticks and eat them. We were survivors of extinction after extinction and we had to relearn each leap forward over and over. Those bands that didn't were left behind. The bands that invented writing beat the system. And if not in the arena of death in Africa, only their ingenuity limited them from there on, same thing with taking a more active attitude towards building a community and a society and an avenue for sharing knowledge, superstitions and all that, religions. It works if proximity isn't a harbinger of death.   That was the balance nature had struck with humanity. It made us grow more intelligent as a species then a loophole was found in the form of latutudes and population islands and writing. That gave ideas a wormhole through time bypassing mortality.The farther back you go and the further down the stack of books you descend, the smaller the difference between the continents becomes. The mind stopped evolving and knowledge itself began to evolve.  So I guess to answer your initial question, one should look at how favourable the conditions were for ideas to survive and for each kind of idea to understand the differences in development.  Rome itself wasn't built in a day, it evolved dragged forward by the evolution of ideas."

Anthropology,35sibh,ademnus,0,Wed May 13 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"And I find the comments here troubling as no one seems able to look at this critically.    including you?   even though nearly everything in society has that effect   false equivalence. Even if we assume everything in the abstract has this effect they certainly don't do so at the same rate. Even if it's true self-help programmes and books, social norms incubated at school, advertising on TV, and attitudes towards mental health, all ensure a conformity to 'the system', they do so in radically different ways, with different contents, different implications, prerequisites, and functions, requiring different discourses and ideologies to be mobilised. Both cancer and nuclear bombs can kill people, doesn't make them the same. Their multiple differences is worth studying. After all why did the self-help movement emerge? Sure, all systems require some sort of legitimising ideology and cannot rely on violence alone, but this should not make us see capitalism as static or frozen 'structure' which simply implies a consistent and predictable set of methods ensuring conformity. After all discussion of neoliberalism explicitly rejects that insofar as neoliberalism is a moment, a historical development of capitalism, and not inherent to it. Therefore placed within it's historical context, the question arises is why did neoliberalism - and the sort of ideology exampled in the OP - develop at all? So even if we assume 'everything' in society has the effect of conformity (which it doesn't), the question still rises as to why does neoliberalism - or more specifically the 'self-help' practices - need to exist? If there was already means of incurring conformity why was more needed - and why at that time - specifically ones analysing mental and 'personal' problems?  My answer would be because neoliberalism was foremost an productive tendencies immanent due to the falling rate of profit in the 1970s, and implying a new approach to labour - and thus society as a whole. Neoliberalism implied a large surplus population (unemployed), precairous low paid flexible labour, privatisation and outsourcing of state assets, and so on. All to impeach the falling rate of profit experienced by capitalism in the early 1970s. Of course if we have a society where competition is more fierce, where individualism is preached to be more important, where work is increasingly flexible and precarious. Then it's unsurprising anxiety will increase. As will depression as the keynesian new order crumbled and (an always illusory) hope died. As the 'citizens' place in the Keynesian social (corporatist) order died so personal and mental problems increased. Labour was attacked, yet the central contradiction to capitalism, it also needs labour. As such capitalism needs some things that allows labour's regressed position to be ensured and maintained, but which momentarily ameliorates the consequences of that position so that labour can continue producing. It's no coincidence that the neoliberal dogma of faux individualism that was posed as the antithesis and cure to the Keynesian order, was also the basis upon which a new order was founded. The individual is the unit of neoliberalism. Yet neoliberalism is a social phenomena. The contradiction with social causes vs. individual cures is exactly what Oprah expresses. The individualism neoliberal ideology speaks means problems are just that, individual. The cause is within you. 'Self-help' - a result of 'individualism - serves as a double position for neoliberalism, it allows it's problematic resultants to be 'outsourced' to the self-help programmes, whilst it also allows for a decrease in the cost of commodities. Self-help after all implies just that more broadly. Hence today we buy furniture to put together ourselves, we use self-service and so on. Making consumers do more means lower costs to capital. Though this tendency isn't absolute."

Don't confuse you're inability to understand or recognise an argument with the existence of said argument. Secondly this isn't science or logic.

Does she analyse the possible cause of that being socio-political or economic? No. The central question is then; is anxiety and other mental problems caused primarily by the socio-economic system? Evidently the answer for self-help and Oprah types is no. This OP argues yes. No one has yet said why they are wrongly beyond repeatedly saying they are so. Personal I would say the assumption that work becoming more flexible and precarious would predictable result in increased anxiety over the fear of the future and worry, is a strong one. Just as increased alienation and mental exhaustion result from the longer and more intense work hours under neoliberalism (the average break or rest-time for lunch in the 1970s was around 1 hour 30 plus, todays it's down to below 30 minutes). For me the types who assume these sort of changes have no effects on the psyche, and the rise in mental problems is accounted for simply because these people have not organised their live correctly, or don't approach work in the correct manner etc. are be bordering on comical if it wasn't so tragic."

""Oprah"" covers a hell of a lot of ground.    The show is widely credited its early acceptance of gays and lesbians.  (And not, as the article might have you believe, counseling them to just stay in the closet and accept that this was the way things were going to be.)  At the height of the AIDS scare, she had a show in a homophobic town in West Virginia and criticized the town's residents for not being the good Christian people they claimed to be. (Again, she's actually going after the power structure, not counseling acceptance).  When, after having an expert discuss mad cow disease, she said that it would be hard for her to eat another hamburger, she was sued by various beef manufacturers for product disparagement.  (Again, not exactly being complicit in capitalist system).  Other parts of her show included interviews with writers, artists, and film makers, plus regular bits dealing with health advice.  And, yes, she also dealt with general issues dealing with anxiety.  Probably most famously in discussing her issues with her weight, including discussing her diet and exercise plan and her training to run a marathon.  I suppose there's an argument to be made (and the author of the linked article apparently makes it) that instead of using diet and exercise to lose weight, Oprah should have criticized the existing power structure for making her fat.

You have provided no arguments at all, and didn't even engage with anything said in the article.   You could make these arguments about the author herself if you chose to.   Why does that matter and which one? The central argument in the piece is against the Stoic slave mentality of conforming to the dominant power structure instead of trying to change it. Oprah -- as the phenomena and larger-than-life personality, rather than the actual person -- is given as an example of a promotion of Stoicism in popular culture. How do you plan to apply this to a little known lefty thinker publishing for a not-all-that-far-reaching lefty publisher?   for someone so staunchly opposed to capitalism, I notice her book costs 10 dollars on kindle, 13 in book form   First, you don't have to live an idea in order to write well about it. Second, being opposed to neo-liberal capitalism doesn't (necessarily) mean that you are opposed to the selling of things. Third, imagine you wanted to read this book on paper (I prefer paper, for example), how much would it cost you to print 160 pages? $13 is not an unreasonable price for a book. Also, she just let you read an excerpt from her book (which was what that article was) to see if you would like to read more or not (which you seem to not want to do).   All she is doing is using a criticism of a well-known figure to sell her book.   No, she is criticizing 4 well-known figures and that is the content of her book. Her thesis is that certain oppressive ideas of neoliberal capitalism are held up in the popular psyche by an appeal of celebrities that say or act as if they are making the world a better place while implicitly (or explicitly) endorsing the structure of oppression. To defend such a thesis (note that I am not saying that she defended it well, since I haven't exchanged those $13 you are worried about, or more importantly my attention and time, to read the book), one would need to give some notable examples... which is exactly what she does."

But instead of examining the economic or political basis of these feelings, she advises us to turn our gaze inward and reconfigure ourselves to become more adaptable to the vagaries and stresses of the neoliberal moment.   That's quite a statement. In fact, everyone who does not tell you to question our economy and our political structure is implicitly telling you to operate within them.  Every professor you had at college who did not ask you to question those things expected you to operate within this system. Your anthropology teacher expected you to get a job in the anthropology field which means participating in the system. Every teacher you had growing up expected you to participate in the system.  Every television commercial expects you to buy their product with money earned from laboring under this system.  Every politician you vote for, no matter how socialist, works for the system, has not yet changed the system, and expects to be voted for in the system.  Your current employer expects you to be in the system. All your formers one did as well.  Every actor, every spokesperson, every tv show host, works under the system and profits from the system.  But Oprah specifically has chosen to address specific social and personal issues because she deliberately seeks to avoid addressing the system and to purposely adapt you to the system better?

First, you don't have to live an idea in order to write well about it   You mean it's ok to be a hypocrite? Fascinating. I can play the game too. ""This author deliberately criticizes the system so you won't notice she is a complicit part of it, making capital by selling you anti-capitalism.""

That is she poses the wrong questions and thus gets bad answers. This is an important distinction insofar as a biologist may also not question the ""economic and political basis"" of our society, but his or her work - the problem attempted to be solved - is unrelated to them. The same doesn't go - the OP argues - for Oprah, insofar as the problems she wishes to negate are the products of a particular functioning system, which she ignores. As such for the biologist they aren't culpable in 'serving the system' insofar as the object of study is distinct from it. For Oprah no such case holds. She can attempt to cover the smell of rotting fish with some fragrance but nevertheless the root cause of her issue, that being ignored, is the fish itself, it remains.

If you'd actually had an argument then you would have pulled apart one of those statements in the argument to show how it is wrong. You didn't. As for a 'proof', this isn't logical mathematics.

It requires lots of resources to write a book for free. She sold her book to the publishers so she could both survive in this world and get her ideas out there. Of course ideally open source is best, but ultimately that requires a post-capitalist society. Until that day writers need to eat, pay rent and so on. If you want a society where everyone has access to ideas (for free) whilst also those who create, develop and debate ideas can live, then you need to negate capitalism.

Anthropology,35jyuj,sunnysidesoviet,5,Mon May 11 02:31:09 2015 UTC,"Cost aside, NYU is a fantastic school.  I never went there and have only been on the campus a couple times, so keep that in mind. A few thoughts:  1) I guarantee your interests will shift (they will your whole life, probably), so don't feel too worried as long as you feel you are getting a good methodological base and exposure to new ideas.  Grad school is where you start to really get depth (as well as any undergrad capstone or thesis project).   2) If I'm not mistaken NYU students (at least grad students?) can take classes at other NYC schools, so you probably have great options just a few subway stops away.  3) Course offerings tend to vary considerably year to year depending on guest professors, who is on sabbatical, and just general turn over of the professors.  You mention fairly broad buckets and I'd be surprised if there were no relevant courses over your next 4 years.  4) As an upperclassman take advantage of any self-directed or independent study with a professor you like.  Great way to explore specific interests.   5) NYU has an unusual structure in terms of departments and programs.  Make sure you are looking at courses in related disciplines (e.g., Labor studies, sociology).  You might find topic related courses in those departments.  There seem to be related faculty hidden away all over the campus.   Good luck."

Many of the bio students wind up working in the UCSC anthro department's wet lab as we have a solid facility for dissections. The department is beginning to expand its physical department with new professors that focus on genomics/genetics, bioarchaeology, etc. On top of that, you have more opportunities to do undergraduate research and work at UCSC than any other UC. UCSC is a very good school if you work hard and take it seriously. I got into Berkeley and chose to attend UCSC because the program was stronger and better suited to what I needed.  Pick a program because it has what you want, not because of the school its associated with. If Davis has the coursework you want to take, go there. Look at the classes being offered. Look at planned classes. Are those what you want to study? Do they apply to what you want to do in the future?

Not that it means much, but I once watched a family of cardinals in the backyard with three eggs in the nest. The parents spent their entire days getting bugs for the chicks once they hatched. The chicks finally left the nest and the parents followed them into the gully where they found shelter. The parents continued to hunt for the chicks after they left the nest.  A couple months later I see the parents in the front yard on the bird feeder. And the fully fledged chicks were with them, scratching for bugs on the ground. The parents would get some seed from the feeder then bring to the chicks, still accepting their parents food.  So technically, these chicks were ""weaned"", capable of flying and getting their own food. Yet they still hung around with the parents as they reached full adulthood.

Maybe someone can look up scholarly articles or I can try again when I get home.   What I found was that the quote fits into the article on drinking patterns as an introduction that the ""norm"" is a resident that engages in social patterns focused around alcohol. I feel like your question seems to want to pull that quote out of the actual article and apply it more broadly, but I believe it the quote is simply saying that ""people want to fit in and fitting in here means drinking"".   Here is the quote in context:  ""Climate. Ethnicity. The historical importance of the brewing industry. The interpersonal dynamics that govern how people learn to live comfortably in a group. The social nature of most drinking. A relative lack of newcomers who might foster change. The premium many here place on being just a regular person. The need for identity.""   Do you see what I mean about a ""regular person"" meaning someone who just engages in the local culture (drinking heavily) without rocking the boat? The ""identity"" mentioned is later explained by quotes from residents as (obviously paraphrasing) ""we drink a lot and can handle it, unlike outsiders!! Because German ancestry (but not really).""   So this was just a long way of saying: it's one sentence in an article about drinking culture, patterns, and history in Wisconsin.

I can think of a few scant circumstances where the adoption of artifacts from another culture is insensitive, such as the trivialization or parody of somber, meaningful cultural artifacts (eg, caricatured native american costumes), but the vast majority of cases where social justice activists claim cultural appropriation, it is through the application of a revisionist version of history which separates the human race between ""white people"" and ""everyone else"", and gives a negative reaction to any case where culture transferred from ""everyone else"" to ""white people"". It's misguided and troubling."
Anthropology,34vn4m,TheFutureFrontier,6,Tue May 5 01:44:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Here's my issue- i do have an anthropology background. I love discussing race and culture, especially cultural reactions to globalization. I'd never heard of the term before a year or so ago, and when I hear it, it seems like it's used as a cross between enculturation and cultural diffusion, but in a negative way"
Anthropology,34vn4m,McDoof,3,Tue May 5 02:46:12 2015 UTC,"The more recent use of ""appropriation"" can't really be separated from other related (and controversial) concepts like ""agency,"" ""privilege,"" and questions of power balance generally. If this were not the case, the transfer of cultural artifacts and behaviors would conform to standard concepts of identity (e.g. Weber's ""subjective collectivity"") and not ""appropriation."" No one complains, for example, when a member of a disenfranchised community ""appropriates"" the artifacts of the more powerful community, but the reverse is quite problematic..."

Anthropology,34vn4m,POLITE_ALL_CATS_GUY,0,Tue May 5 12:37:12 2015 UTC,"The reason you've never heard an anthropologist use the term, is because it's bullshit and if you use the term, it just goes to show that you have no idea about how culture has been shared and what culture actually is."
Anthropology,34vn4m,McDoof,5,Tue May 5 11:05:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I never use the term myself (I teach intercultural communication), but I wouldn't dismiss it so quickly. I'm an American teaching in Germany where cultural studies is less political and more anthropological, I would say.  Here, you can (for better or worse) make statements about identity, cultural practices, and related topics without much fear of saying the wrong thing and offending others.  It seems to me that the phrase ""cultural appropriation"" in a continental European discussion would be much more neutral than the same term used by Anglophones. While this avoidance (ignorance?) of evolving political dynamics related to gender, ethnicity, and other identities makes the communication here much less complicated, I wonder sometimes if the valuable aspect of the political orientation should be more present."
Anthropology,34vn4m,POLITE_ALL_CATS_GUY,2,Tue May 5 11:38:45 2015 UTC,"I mean summed up what I was trying to say is cultural appropriation is something that can happen, but solid examples of cultural appropriation are few and far between.  And much more subtle then tumblr will ever have you think. Edit: I'm gonna steal an edit here.  Whn cultures meet and exchange ideas is that cultural appropriation?  Or is it the blatant use of cultural customs by another culture as a means of disrespect.  Because I've seen the prior called cultural appropriation countless times and it bothers me to no end."
Anthropology,34vn4m,McDoof,4,Tue May 5 12:00:16 2015 UTC,"I think the power dynamic is key in any analysis, to answer your question. The social philosopher Norbert Elias describes power in terms of prestige, for example.  And, if I understand OP's use of ""cultural appropriation,"" prestige might be a good lens through which to observe/understand it. Elies describes two main kinds of prestige: economic and cultural.  We can see these as a matrix with any combination of the two prestiges as high or low: 1. High economic prestige and high cultural prestige are the elites. 2. High economic prestige and low cultural prestige are the nouveau riche. 3. low economic prestige and high cultural prestige are the avant garde. 4. Low economic prestige and low cultural prestige are the disenfranchised. Stay with me here... So, what is most interesting for our discussion is probably the ""appropriation"" of cultural prestige by the economically advantaged.  No one gets upset, for example, when Jay-Z ""appropriates"" the style of the economic elites by wearing Italian suits and driving German cars.  As a hiphop artist, his origins are in the avant garde of cultural relevance without broad economic influence.  But what we would find to be unacceptable appropriation might be the co-opting of street fashion by the elites.  This we would call insensitive, fake and (among the more politically-minded) possibly racist, classist, or culturally insensitive."

You can't really escape them if you're in a dense area, so the key is to set up shop in open breezy dry areas because mosquitoes like moist stagnant environments the most. The great thing about rural areas in regards to mosquitoes is that the mosquitoes have options and go to their ideal settings, so you the human can find places where they are not. When you have to be around mosquitos you stay as covered up as possible, or slather yourself in a salve made of ingredients that mosquitoes find repellent, obviously this is not ideal hence the importance of building community in places that do not harbour mosquitoes."

Supposedly Nairobi was above it. Now it is not. Whether there is any truth in this or not (Among others, Al Gore says its true, while scientists disagree), people create systems of meaning like this as a way for them to understand / mitigate / avoid risk. Someone probably felt that the mosquitoes weren't so bad in Nairobi (hard to believe, since they have a river running through it = some stagnant water pooling), associated that with its height, and so the idea was born.   ALSO  'Dealing' with a problem isn't always achieved by the means of  creating a practical solution. Something can just as equally be dealt with by attempting to make sense of and understanding the problem, in your own terms, and with the resources available to you.

The anthropologist was trying to understand why.  One of the reasons she found was that the smoke from their cooking fire kept the mosquitoes out of the house while they were cooking.  If they used the stove instead, mosquitoes would swarm into the house and bite them.  So maybe smoke and fires have traditionally been used to keep them away."

I understand that in the context of antibiotic resistance, this is relevant (medical care = anitbiotics, western agriculture = antibiotics, pesticides and biocides), but it seems to imply a progression from traditional --> modern practices as natural and apolitical. If the problem is that we are using too many antibiotics, then why are we welcoming MORE people entering some sort of inevitable system that uses antibiotics...

Anthropology,34k381,fresasandcrema,6,Fri May 1 20:57:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that long hair has traditionally been considered very feminine - look at pictures of Louis XIV, for example, or Charles II of England, or any number of other pre-19th century men.  But the answer to why things have changed within the past 200 years is something known as the ""masculine renunciation"".    This was when fashionable men stopped wearing colorful silks, high-heeled shoes, stockings, lace, and long carefully groomed hair.   Instead, they started copying the clothing worn by the most prestigious men of that time...the new industrialists.  These men wore dark suits (so coal ash wouldn't show) and shorter hair (and shoes) to avoid accidents that might happen around a lot of machinery with moving parts.  Add a few details from military clothing, and you get the beginning of the modern suit.  Women, however, who were not industrialists, continued to wear the previous fashions."

Anthropology,34k381,bbltn,0,Sat May 2 21:57:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, this is just me guessing.  It takes years of good nutrition to grow a long head of hair, and not much good comes from having one. That makes it useful as a fitness indicator for sexual selection. People with healthy long hair are well-fed, more likely to be fertile, and able to survive with a large mane, which are all good signs. Males selecting for long hair in females are using it as an indicator of fertility, youth, and health.   Female sexual selection tends to value different traits more than male sexual selection. From the female perspective, male fertility is much less time-sensitive, and hence less important. Male nutrition is also less vital since they don't carry children (although of course being well-fed is always a fitness indicator).   A female is selecting for a male with the best genes available, to make her children more fit. In our species, males show their fitness through sports, hunting, warfare, and creative expression. Having long hair is more cumbersome in a fight, leads to overheating, adds extra weight, etc. Those negative implications represent selection pressure away from having long hair. Since men engage in more activities that exert those pressures against long hair, female preference for long hair in males is kept more in check than male preference for long hair in females.  In other words, males might have been under more pressure from natural selection to keep it short than they were under sexual pressure to keep it long, whereas females were under more sexual pressure to prove health and fertility and thus benefited more from the length. Over a long time this led to many cultures around the world associating long hair with femininity."

I take the point that a 8 year old child would have more reproductive years ahead of her, but that doesn't explain why there should be sexual attraction.   1) You explain a biological impulse with a social construct of marriage, which has to be there in order for the ""she's fertile for longer"" argument to work. But does nature precede societal constructs in this context?   2) why would the man be sexually bound to one girl?  3) where is the reproductive value in having sex with multiple pre-fertile women?  4) assuming there is divorce, a rational pedophile would continue to have sex through some form of serial monogamy?"

Does the relative dimorphism of weight and height remain basically constant for different human populations?  Do we see any differences in past remains?  Do these ratios vary at all depending on nutrition or subsistence patterns?  A quick search yielded a possible answer:  In this paper we test these hypotheses using a sample of extant human groups. Results indicate that extant agriculturalists exhibit a greater degree of sexual dimorphism in stature than extant hunter-gatherers. Moreover, the data analysed in this paper do not indicate that a more equal division of labor is associated with a decrease in human height sexual dimorphism.

My job is not in the anthro field, but I like it, and I'm planning on using it as a leg-up into a museum setting.   I'd say that finding a job in the field with just a BA depends a lot on what you've combined with your major (minor, research projects, internships, etc), and your location. I'm in DC, and there are a lot of jobs that are in the field or at least loosely related. I can't really speak for other areas though.  Personally, I think getting my BA in anthro was totally worth it. If you want to go on for an MA or PhD, I'd say its a good foundation to have, regardless of what you go on to study. If you're not interested in going further, do a lot more than JUST get the major, and you'll find something. You might just have to broaden your scope a little bit."

I graduated December 2013 and was hired at the start of January 2014. My original title was laboratory technician but I received a promotion last month. While job advancement clearly is possible, there is a limit to how far I will be able to get without a graduate degree and that limit is not enough for me so I will be applying to grad school next year. To give it some perspective on limitations, two of my coworkers are in their late 30s/early 40s and both went back to school this year because they had advanced as far as they could. Both have almost two decades of experience but that just doesn't beat out a graduate degree.  At my firm only those with a MA or PhD can advance to project managers or archaeologists and they are also the only ones allowed to do certain field projects due to regulations and such (we do a lot of government work). In my experience stopping at an undergrad definitely does limit you; it's just up to each person to decide if that limitation is acceptable to him or her.  For me, it is not.

It's not necessarily a steady income, but that seems to be what works best for them.   My biggest tip would just be determination!

Don't lose hope, but don't be a sucker and believe your advisors wholeheartedly.

Right out of college I started working in the nonprofit sector running political campaigns. It was okay, really rewarding at times but soul-crushing at others. Three years ago I decided to go back for my MA with the hopes of being able to find a more rewarding job with a nonprofit, but I then this amazing project fell onto my head. The first semester I worked on it, it pretty well consumed my whole attention - my first research paper was published in a journal the next semester. Academia hooked me hard! My department has been excellent as well, so I decided to stay in the same place for my PhD to continue that research.  I like to think I've been pretty successful so far - I'll be presenting my own research at my fourth conference this summer and I have a book chapter coming out soon. I love where I'm at, and for me that definitely wouldn't have been possible without graduate school.  I say go for it - there are so many possibilities for an anthropology student; my friends from undergrad are doing all sorts of different things (working at a CRM firm, writing fiction, nonprofit work of various sorts, I think one dude helps run a microbrewery). Although I would say, if you decide to go the nonprofit route, find something you're interested in and then consider going back for an MA. It will give you a chance to find your footing in that industry first, and then give you the competitive credentials to rise in the field.  Or fully geek out and join me in academia. It's great.

I've read how people in northern Europe are fair because they were able to digest milk but there is such a tiny natural amount of vitamin D in milk the majority of vitamin D in milk now is added during packaging. But northern people still had to be fair skinned to get more from the dim sunlight during the long winter months there would be no sun at all or almost negligible.  The reverse of that people in northern climates who retained dark skin if they had access to lots of oily fish which Innu, Aleut and ""Eskimo"" people had.

This is a common misconception.  In reality, the selective pressure in hot climates isn't for height, but rather, is for high surface area as a ratio to total body mass, thus making it easier to shed heat.  Conversely, the same is true of cold climates; the selective pressure isn't for short people, but rather, is for low surface area relative to body mass, thus making it easier to conserve heat.  This, of course, is one of the reasons why Scandinavians tend to be one of the tallest populations on the planet while also being pretty well adapted to cold weather in relative terms.    Finally, it's worth noting that as far as anyone can tell, beyond a few broad trends, human variation really isn't all that environmentally determined and to the contrary, largely seems to be a consequence of who happened to wander in to what corner of the globe and at which particular point in time, homo sapiens being the ridiculously adaptable beast that it is."

Darker skin gets less efficient as making vitamin D, but when you live in a place like Africa, where it's pretty much always sunny, you don't need such sensitive skin, and it might even be detrimental.

Anthropology,3406az,Buffalo__Buffalo,12,Mon Apr 27 08:57:16 2015 UTC,"I don't believe there is such thing as the most fun culture to learn about, but there are definitely some interesting ones that stuck out to me during my undergrad years. To more knowledgable anthropologists they are likely the first ones you learn about, but if you don't know too much they might be a good place to start.   I found Cargo Cults to be pretty interesting as they are Melanesian aboriginals that were affected by European settlements and airports in the area. They saw cargo planes as a gift from the gods to the white man and thought it only fair that the gods give them cargo planes too. So they built their society around a home made runway and they sit and wait for their god to deliver.   If you want to learn more  In terms of witchcraft, the Azande tribe have some interesting ideas. They believe that when anything bad happens, it is because a witch has taken over the belly of the person involved. if a granary breaks apart and kills someone, for instance, it is because another person from the tribe who resented the victim had a witch within their belly. They build their social justice system around this and have a rather curious form of determining who holds the witch. The poison oracle (Benge) feeds a chick some home made poison and asks it a yes or no question. if the chick dies, the answer is yes. Many convictions occur solely based on this.  More about Azande  If you want something more controversial, look at the Sambia people. Some serious moral questions have come up regarding cultural and moral relativity as they have some extreme rites of passages. They include male maturization rituals where the young boys are held in huts and forced to perform fellatio on the tribe elders. Part of their belief system revolves around the idea that sperm is the giver of life and it is limited so it must be passed down to the young. Female rituals also involve ingestion of menstrual blood from elder women.  I believe there is a documentary on this (no rituals shown, just interviews with tribe members).   More info on Sambia  Edit: accidentally pressed save while writing..."
Anthropology,3406az,pokeahontas,2,Mon Apr 27 07:19:19 2015 UTC,"The fictional ""The People in the Trees"" has a fictional culture much like the Sambia people. Interesting to think the author may have researched them before or during writing. Great book in terms of quality. Still can't deal with the subject matter though.   Just out of curiosity and the hunt for more parallels: have the Sambia people been introduced to the outside world's culture in such a way that the remains of their culture are kind of dispersed? Do they still practice those rituals? (I'm going to read the Wikipedia link in a moment, just have to get ready for work first.)"

If it is fictional I tend to lose interest quickly though... there are too many real cultures I have left to learn about!   In terms of the Sambia, I am not sure if they have been assimilated into modern society, but they have absolutely been exposed to it. I learned a bulk of this information from a documentary in anthropology class. I distinctly remember them wearing western clothes (i.e. t-shirts and jeans) but they still lived in huts and maintained their values. They were interviewed by white males so they definitely had enough access to modern societies for someone to fluently converse in their language, and the women seemed embarrased to tell stories of their rituals, though it may have been because the interviewer was a guy.

I haven't heard yet what the final straw was for the cultural consultant, but once he left the set, the actors had had enough as well.  What old western trope is calling a character ""Beaver's Breath"" mocking? In the script, the phrase ""Beaver Breath"" is intended as an insult, though the character ends up being surprised that the person hurling the insult knew her actual name.  Compare this to ""Alotta Fagina"" from the first Austin Powers movie. It's also a lewd name, but its parodying the double entendre of many Bond girl names (specifically Pussy Galore in this case).  If Sandler wanted to make fun of old Westerns, he had plenty to work with. One of my favorite suggestions I heard elsewhere would be to give the Apache in the movie various Italian cultural affectations, as a joke about how old Westerns had non-Native actors - Italian actors most famously - play Native parts. But calling a character ""Beaver Breath"" just strikes me as a ""Native people have funny animal names"" joke and not as a parody or satire of Western tropes."

I only have Wikipedia sources, but professional mourning is a worldwide phenomenon, although lost in the 20th century in the West it seems.  Wikipedia says it existed in Europe until 1914.  This says it was very much a part of Mediterranean and Near Eastern cultures further back in time.

Being a traveling archaeologist basically means that all relationships become long-distance relationships. Even with fellow co-workers. We'll become really close on one project, and then not see each other for a year or more.  That being said, maintaining these long-term relationships is probably a lot easier these days than it was in the past.  Speaking just for myself,  I think ambitious people (amongst whom I count myself) need to really analyze why they are ambitious, what it's all for."

Anthropology,33kde0,FerretBerries,4,Thu Apr 23 05:42:34 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the notion of being too old. I had one professor who told his students straight up to take a year or two off before going to grad school so they could pursue other interests and make sure that a masters/phd was really what they wanted to do. I find that the older students are usually more serious in their studies. They're there to learn and get their money's worth. I am concerned though about what job prospects you plan to have in the future. If you're not planning this out and know exactly what you want from it, your going to end up with debt and a degree that you most likely won't use."

This was in a top 10 program.  More important are your skills, experience, proposed research, all the other stuff that goes into an application.  In archaeology specifically, I have heard a lot of professors say they see taking time off to work after undergrad as a positive, since it means you will come to the grad program with your field skills more developed than the fresh BAs who usually just have one field school.

Plus in a majority of fields people get their ba, work for a while, then come back for ma or PhD.   Don't sweat it. Life happens and I think most programs know that."

Second: Speaking from personal experience, the WORST thing you can do is wrap any professional endeavor up in what you think ""other people"" will think of you. That puts you on the road to mental breakdown.  Third: Anyone can make a contribution to the field if they work at it. But don't get caught up on making your ""contribution"" -- just be concerned with developing yourself and choosing a subject you truly want to research and are willing to do the work to get funding for. Additionally, make sure it's a topic/area that you can get funded.   Ok... there is one important thing to discuss honestly about age and academics (by that I mean if you think you will complete your degree in your late 30's or 40's). If you are planning to undertake an academic career you are most likely going to have to do a number of post-docs.   This realistically means moving a number of times in a pretty short amount of time. And those moves tend to become increasingly disruptive the older you get, especially if you have a partner/family. So that MUST be something that you discuss EARLY in a budding relationship and your partner MUST be onboard with (either having everyone move or being willing to live apart for wide amounts of time)."

Anthropology,33juvx,jimmykimmell,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:42:30 2015 UTC,"the thing you have to realize is that cultural anthropology is just one of the four ""pillars"" of the subject and, at least at my school, an undergrad degree had to have a pretty equal split between the four as far as number of courses taken. In addition to cultural anthropology courses, which are pretty different from undergrad sociology courses (took a few of those too), you need  solid framework in biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archeology. this being said I dont believe there is any limit to what a person can teach themselves, but a lot of it (especially archeology) can be rather tedious and process oriented (site mapping, dating processes, what bone or artifact features mean what, ect ect) that could be kind of difficult with out hands on instruction. That and you would also want to have a pretty solid background in biology and genealogy to get through a lot of the biological anthro stuff on your own. This is all stuff you will probably be expected to at least be familiar with for a masters program and really, at the end of the day anthro and sociology are too very different fields And the tendency of undergrad sociology profs to sell them as being similar is a huge pet peeve of anthro departments everywhere. This is not ment to discourage you, if you wanted to pursue a masters in anthro you absolutely could with enough work, but it will be like pursuing a masters in any other liberal arts program you didnt major in. Majoring in sociology wouldnt give you anymore advantage in a masters of anthro than it would english or psych or philosophy ect"
Anthropology,33juvx,theemptyworld,-3,Thu Apr 23 04:13:10 2015 UTC,"Aside from buying a degree, I really don't see how you can get out of this.

Anthropology,33juvx,sbmoore,4,Thu Apr 23 02:50:57 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of professional rivalry between anthropologists and sociologists. Often anthropologists are accused of being focused on people ""in loin cloths"" and sociologists are accused of being overly focused on urban environments, but in reality there is a tremendous theoretical and methodological gulf between the two disciplines. I come from an anthropological background, so I am totally biased, but I think that one of the benefits of anthropology is that you analyze cultures holistically, taking into consideration their history, biology, psychology, life ways, etc. I think that you could pursue an MA in anthropology with a sociology background, but IMO you are going to need to make sure that your understanding of basic linguistic, physical anthropological, and archaeological concepts is petty solid."
Anthropology,33juvx,bojank33,5,Thu Apr 23 03:48:27 2015 UTC,"Anthropology is absolutely not a precursor to Sociology. It offers a completely different lenses to view humans through than Sociology. It seems that you do not realize that Cultural Anthropology is only one of four sub disciplines. While it is very similar to Sociology, it is highly influenced by the other three, which have very little to do with Sociology comparatively. Linguistics, Physical Anthropology, and Archaeology while related to the Cultural discipline take much different routes to answering research questions and often attempt to answer vastly different questions. The goals of an anthropologist can range from having very little to do with studying a culture to focusing on it exclusively. An anthropologist will blend all of the previously mentioned disciplines to attempt to answer a myriad of questions ranging from the linguistic capabilities of Neandertals (Archaeology, Linguistic, and Biological Anthropology) to subsistence patterns of past Native American cultures (Archaeology, Cultural, and Biological Anthropology) to how companies can reach target demographics most effectively in advertising (Cultural Anthropology).   All of that said I would suggest immersing yourself in literature from all four disciplines. There are far too many essential writings to list here, so take a look at the reading lists for the Anthro classes at your university and start there. You are most certainly are behind in this regard and it is essential that you understand the lens in which an anthropologist views humanity if you want to succeed in grad school. The holistic approach we take is tantamount to our understanding of the human race. Not to discourage you, but I think it would very difficult to teach yourself four years worth of undergrad work and a new lens in which the view the world, all while simultaneously learning a separate and almost competing discipline through your university. Not that it can't be done, you will just have to seriously commit yourself to the independent study necessary for success."
Anthropology,33juvx,GloomMidoriHikkuko,3,Thu Apr 23 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"Hi OP! Do research about the programs you want to apply to long before you actually apply, and make sure you have some related experience in anthropology (if possible). I will be attending a master's anthropology program in the fall, and I know that my program will accept applicants who did not major in anthropology. They only require you to take additional classes for background if accepted into the program. I believe there are many other programs that also allow this, but you have to check and make sure! It's totally possible, and you should also explain how your BA in sociology will prove useful while at an anthro MA program. Stress this in your application, and you should do well! Good luck OP!"
Anthropology,33juvx,reverendswann,2,Thu Apr 23 03:59:12 2015 UTC,"Hi there--anthropology PhD student here.   Rather than thinking about whether or not you can pursue graduate studies in anthropology (of course you can, but it might be a mistake to), think instead about what you would want to study and why you would want to study it as an anthropologist. A topic of study will help you to research schools and programs more than simply thinking anthropology is cool (it is!).   I would NOT, however, propose to blend sociology and anthropology. Why? Well, because most anthropology and sociology is already a blend of the two. Despite what we say about each other, the disciplines are not as distinct as we might like to think. Anthropologists work with sociological data and texts, and sociologists use our work and methods all the time. It's basically the new norm. There is also a lot of overlap between anthropology and sociology in terms of current research topics and theory. In fact, most anthropology graduate students are expected to have, or develop, a working knowledge of major sociological works and theories. Goffman, Weber, Bourdieu, Durkheim, Mills, etc...we read them in anthropology too.  I also wouldn't worry about brushing up on all four fields. If you apply to do a sociocultural track/program, you will not be expected to be conversant in archaeology or biological anthropology. In fact, the four fields approach mostly exists in undergraduate pre-requisites and intro to anthropology textbooks. Read an ethnography on a topic you are interested in and you will see that, almost without exception, the author will not have taken a four field approach. Two years into my program, all I've read about the four field approach was a statement from the AAA saying (half-heartedly) that we should keep it. It's also a super American thing--most anthropology programs in the rest of the world wouldn't even know what ""four fields"" means if you asked them.  Finally, I would think about what kinds of jobs you want. Pursuing academia at the grad level is more geared towards getting a PhD. MA students rarely get the care and attention they pay for (oh yeah, and they usually pay). If the jobs you want do not require an MA in anthropology, get something more marketable instead. You have the whole rest of your life to read ethnography.  Hope this helps!"

That being said your focus on International Relations is specific enough to point you in the direction of the UN and the plethora of NGOs.  If you're in the US the State Department and Department of Defense (shhhh, don't tell other anthropologists)....basically any organization that deals with human interaction could use the support of someone with anthropological training.  Will you get a job that says ""Anthropologists"" on it? Probably not. But there are jobs out there that require observational, interviewing, and analytical skills-- all of which anthropology can teach you.

Anthropology,33gslb,anutensil,2,Wed Apr 22 12:12:30 2015 UTC,"The street sounds in India are anything but fading. I spent a few months there last year. Shopping malls are certainly popping up here and there, but they are still far and few between and only really in the most developed urban areas. They also only really seemed to appeal to the wealthy few.   I visited two shopping malls in Chennai partly out of curiosity and partly in a hunt for a McDonalds. Although western fast food and brands, like Levis, Lacoste and even Marks and Spencers were available they were very clearly not popular with the majority, or affordable for them either. When asking for directions not a single person I spoke to knew what McDonalds was. In Chennai, and every other city I visited, traditional market districts were far, far busier. I did not visit Mumbai, which is certainly going to be unique in regards to the wealth and development, but realistically the progression I witnessed seemed to have a distinctly Indian characteristic anyway and any genuine modern westernisation was highly isolated to either the wealthiest areas or regions with tourism like Goa.    One of my motivations for visiting India was that I wanted to see a totally different culture before it had succumbed to the influences of homogenizing globalisation. From my observations this is not something to be overly concerned about in India. Street vendors are still overwhelmingly numerous and quite clearly an integral part of life for the vast majority. There was little evidence in any of the regions I visited that this was changing at all. The nicest mall I visited was very quiet in comparison to the city outside.     a city in constant flux—one whose shopping malls and suburbs are slowly rendering street vendors obsolete.  “We can’t tell...how long they will be around,” she tells Sturgis.   I completely disagree with her. Shopping malls, from what I could see, provide little competition to street vendors throughout the majority of the country, and even to an outsider it seemed obvious that street vending as an industry is thriving, even if the individuals that practice it make relatively little money."

Not having opposable thumbs doesn't mean you're not a primate; it means that you're a primate without thumbs. A distinguishing characteristics of mammals is live birth, but there are a few mammals that lay eggs.  At best you could make a case for homo sapien holt-oram, assuming you and a select others don't interbreed with homo sapien sapien for a few tens of thousands of years, and develop a few more signature traits, but in the meantime you're just homo sapien sapien like the rest of us."

Anthropology,3390mx,Mictlantecuhtli,4,Mon Apr 20 16:43:43 2015 UTC,According to these folks Neanderthal use of fire is well documented.  Here is a link to the journal article.  Homo erectus is though to have been able to make and control fire as well.  This Slate article covers the fire use debate pretty well and includes internal links to further sources.
Anthropology,3390mx,7LeagueBoots,7,Tue Apr 21 01:48:49 2015 UTC,"What? This stereotype of the stupid Neanderthal really needs to stop. In some ways, they were actually more advanced than homo sapiens. They used a very complicated process to make a type of glue from tree bark, for example."
Anthropology,3390mx,SBCrystal,1 point,Tue Apr 21 08:08:45 2015 UTC,"Some say they were a subspecies, Homo sapiens neanderthalensis. I agree with you, the stupid image of them is just because of Hollywood."

Anthropology,3390mx,AdrianEvans,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:04:25 2015 UTC,I always assumed that they could harness fire. I'm not sure where I got this concept. According to this article maybe they didn't.
Anthropology,3390mx,ikevinax,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"If they couldn't harness fire, then how they not die off sooner? They lived in the time of the Ice age and had to take shelter from the brutish weather somehow. I'm sure some did succumb to the environment in those times of scarcity and inadequate supplies, but surely not all of them."
Anthropology,3390mx,colt_horton,0,Thu Apr 23 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"Is there any reason to suppose that they were too dumb to use it? I think fire-less humans were probably at a disadvantage, it's not necessarily easy to discover, and once discovered you could lose the secret in minutes or hours unless you figure out everything just right immediately. This is true for hsap too.  Supposing they did not have it, skills like this are easily transferrable. They never encountered a cromagnon (or whatever it's called now days) who did know how to use it, never learned from them? That's absurd. It would only have had to be learned once. Supposing they didn't figure it out on their own anyway... I rather suspect they were as likely to do this as modern humans.  I half-suspect that could teach this to chimps, if you tried.  Neanderthals? Fuck, you could have probably taught them metallurgy given the chance."

Anthropology,335ede,naivesuperiority,3,Sun Apr 19 18:41:29 2015 UTC,"I was in the exact situation. Loved the department and the city, but my professors basically told me they wouldn't accept me because I need to spread my wings and learn from new minds.  On the other end of the spectrum, let me give you a quote from a rather ""star"" anthropologist when I was asked him for similar advice to what you are asking:  ""while these decisions appear momentous now, you can't really go wrong in choosing between departments. In the end what matters is your own strengths and commitment to the field, the cohort of students you interact with, and a bit of serendipity."""
Anthropology,335ede,magicsauc3,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:36:14 2015 UTC,Thanks!
Anthropology,335ede,wildgwest,3,Mon Apr 20 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend was in the same situation. She got her BA in anthro, and wants to do a MA in bio-anthro [then onto a PhD]. She spent a great deal of time researching schools, sent out 5 applications, and got ""yes"" from 2 [one being the uni she got the BA from]. She was also conflicted, because on the one hand, it might be better to go elsewhere, but the program at her current uni was the better choice.   I think it also boils down to what you want to do afterwards. If you want to go into a private sector job or consulting, it won't be as big of a deal. I don't think employers at for profit firms have the same aversion to multiple degrees from the same institution.   If you want to do research and be a professor [thus getting a PhD], then I'd recommend getting at least one of the degrees from somewhere else. I have seen people's CV's with all three degrees from the same place, but it's rare. So if you want to do a PhD after the MA, either do the MA somewhere else and come back for the PhD, or do the MA there and go elsewhere for the PhD.   To sum up, it depends greatly on what you want to do AFTER the MA. If you wanted to go onto a PhD, I'd probably recommend a switch, but if you wanted to go into the workforce, then it doesn't matter as much."
Anthropology,335ede,wildgwest,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:11:00 2015 UTC,Thanks :) I plan on a PhD so that makes it a little clearer for me.

Anthropology,330sz1,AlmightyAgnostic,2,Sat Apr 18 11:55:44 2015 UTC,"Different grad schools have different requirements. Some may not accept you at all while others will look at your application and may require you to take some classes to bring you ""up to speed."" Your best bet really is researching admissions requirements on the particular schools you're thinking of."
Anthropology,330sz1,Ejoriah,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:24:16 2015 UTC,Do you think it would be acceptable for me to contact grad school even though I am still in a community college?
Anthropology,330sz1,Ejoriah,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:33:34 2015 UTC,"They should list admission requirements on their webpage, along with the contact info of someone who can answer more specific questions. It'll be fine if you contact them, even though you are still in a community college... although be sure to read through the website first to see if your question has been answered."
Anthropology,330rik,AlmightyAgnostic,1 point,Sat Apr 18 11:32:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a third year in the bio anth program at ucsb. We have a medium sized department that's a little under funded, but overall it is a very strong program. Plenty of awesome professors and if you're willing to put in the work, a lot of internships that will pay. The department has top notch bio arch facilities if you're interested in that. I don't know much about the Bio major, except that it is really compacted here."
Anthropology,330rik,paleoclay,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:01:40 2015 UTC,"How is that program. What is there main focus by the way? Genetics, paleotology, ect."
Anthropology,330rik,paleoclay,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:32:30 2015 UTC,"The bio arch program is amazing! There are a few emphasis directions you can take with the major here. There isn't really a main focus, it's very broad bio Anth and you have the freedom to move in what direction you prefer, or just get a more holistic degree. I went in the direction of forensic anthro and bio arch."
Anthropology,330rik,dahngrest,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:48:14 2015 UTC,Do they have alot of options with paleoanthropology? I love that. But does the program allow you to take alot of bio courses? Both are my favorite. I am probably going to contact one of the advisers and discuss the program more. I think her name is Amber.....but might be wrong. Thank you for the reply. Makes me feel more comfortable about that program.
Anthropology,330rik,dahngrest,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:37:36 2015 UTC,You should look into UCSC. The biological portion of their anthropology department is growing right now and the professors being hired are fantastic. I graduated just as the department really started to get its footing. The lead bio-anth professor is now doing a year long thesis course and many of his students wound up presenting at the SAAs this year.  UCSC's bio program is also pretty huge. There are three different specializations and nearly all of the courses tie in well with the direction the bio-anth courses are going.
Anthropology,330rik,dahngrest,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:56:06 2015 UTC,I heard they only do general anthropology degree. But I will look it up. Heard they do a joint degree with earth science and anthropology.  Do you think it would be attainable to minor in biology or double in both?
