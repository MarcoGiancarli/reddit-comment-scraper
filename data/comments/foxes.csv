foxes,3defht,Foxtrot3100,-1,Wed Jul 15 23:44:29 2015 UTC,Don't take it to the vet. I don't think wild animals would be given medical attention. Maybe give it food. But I have a feeling nature is going to take its course...
foxes,3defht,Vulpyne,3,Wed Jul 15 17:52:37 2015 UTC,"Are you crazy? Yes take it to the vet! It's a wild animal but if you found an eagle with a broken wing you wouldn't let it just expire, would you? The vet would be able to treat it and connect to proper authorities to reintroduce it to the wild, or rehabilitate it."
foxes,3defht,Foxtrot3100,5,Wed Jul 15 19:48:29 2015 UTC,"The average vet isn't going to be set up to take care of wild animals. They aren't going to be able to keep a fox in the cages among the dogs, it would probably drive the dogs crazy and terrify the fox. They couldn't even easily handle the fox.  What the OP probably wants is a wildlife rehab organization, not a vet. I don't know where they live and this is fairly US specific, but it may help: http://www.nwrawildlife.org/content/finding-rehabilitator  I don't know if I'd advise trying to capture it though. There's a decent chance of getting bit, and there's always the possibility of the fox having a nasty disease. One would also have to be very careful while transporting the fox and moving it around. A horrified fox loose in the car on the way to the rehab place would not be fun for anyone."

foxes,3d6u98,drummer_San,7,Mon Jul 13 23:52:47 2015 UTC,"Try not to ruin it for other people.   I know this is harsh advice, but laws are often made emotionally. Why do you think pitbulls are often illegal? If you are going to do it, do it the best way you can. I plan on getting an exotic pet in the future and I know I would be a great caregiver, but many don't see it that way. Dealing with PETA is one thing. Everyone knows they are crazy. Dealing with people who think rats are gross and dogs are dangerous is another."
foxes,3d6u98,electricfoxx,3,Tue Jul 14 00:08:05 2015 UTC,"All I can say is know what you're getting into before getting into it. Follow fox people on sites like tumblr, or facebook, where you can see day to day activities with their fox. One day it will be a picture of a cute and super snuggly mr.foxy, the next, entire room destroyed to fuck. Foxes make rewarding pets due to the amount of bonding you need to have with one, so make sure you have hours to be with the fox. Most people don't even spend that much time with their dogs. They will destroy shit, it's in their nature. If your 100 dollar dress shoes are on their list of things-they're-going-to-fuck-up-today, you're going to have to put them away. This means fox-proofing anything of value, because they will stumble upon it one day and destroy it. Foxes can be leash-trained, but as they are still wild animals the slightest thing can set off a switch in their minds to make them decide to go bat shit insane. Don't try walking a fox unless you're automatically prepared for it to not be a good experience. Their diet needs to consist of taurine, in it's natural form."
foxes,3d6u98,Brythespy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:44:41 2015 UTC,"i did some reading up on taurine but found only vague mentions of what contains the acid.  Many wet cat foods contain taurine, but you said ""in its natural form.""  Would wet cat food give Rosie her daily requirement of taurine?"

foxes,3d6u98,Valridagan,5,Wed Jul 15 15:11:28 2015 UTC,"Foxes are not domesticated, save for a small group in Moscow, and those are not for sale.  It is very rare to find OR RAISE an adult fox that will behave the way a human wants them to behave.  99.99% of all foxes on the planet are wild animals and will almost always act like wild animals.  There are a few people that happened to get extraordinarily lucky with their foxes, and raised foxes that get along with people.  They are vocal, but they are in the extreme minority.  Many people who get foxes find that they're nice and playful as kits, but when they become adults they show their wild-ness and become aggressive and disruptive, and many are put down.  Please, PLEASE do not get a fox, at all, for any reason.  It will be a travesty.  Spend your money on something less risky and temporary.    If foxes were remotely possible to house safely for years, you would be buying ""fox food"" and ""fox brushes"", not dog food and dog brushes.  Other people have tried it.  It does not turn out well."

foxes,3c4y5s,i336_,2,Sun Jul 5 00:46:25 2015 UTC,"Hate to admit it but, I used GMStudio 1.4. I only say that because I know a number of languages and work as a developer but, I like the idea that a lot of my work is done for me as far as setting up an engine. Sprite work and level design took some time.   I was going for old win 3.1x/DOS games that didn't allow animation since GDI drawing was expensive. Yes, there is some animation in some parts of the game but, I broke the style when I felt it was appropriate."

And I liked the style you used a lot. :D  Also, I'm kinda interested in making a retro game/game engine at some point, I kinda might've wanted to target Win3.1... I'm very curious (this is a serious question), are there any fancy tricks I can do to speed up animation updating on older hardware? Like, say, never yielding to the kernel, perhaps, or somehow pulling a fast one on the graphics stack and just directly writing video memory? Or...?"

foxes,3appz1,Vulpyne,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"You should be really careful about handling wild animal babies. In some cases, human scent can result in the mother rejecting the baby. Even just disturbing an area can cause the parents to leave the babies. I do not know for sure if this applies to foxes or not or what the risk is exactly but I would suggest not taking the chance unless you are highly knowledgeable about those effects.  Also, it's pretty risky handling wild animals in general, even cubs. You might get bit or scratched and even if you wouldn't do anything about it there's the possibility of other people finding out and taking matters into their own hands. The most likely result of the cub biting you and the authorities being involved is the cub being captured and killed to perform a rabies test.  Finally, just desensitizing wild animals to humans can be pretty bad for the animals.   Sorry to rain on your parade.  edit: I'm curious about the downvotes. Do people believe my post is factually incorrect? If so, I'm certainly open to being set straight.   edit: Okay, it's not necessarily to reply telling me the scent thing is a myth anymore. Thanks for the responses. I will note, however that it's not really ruled out just not known to happen as a general rule. Handling baby animals could always cause the parents to abandon it just from being disturbed, or to try to move their young to another location (incurring some risk). To me it seems like too much of a risk to take just for a fun experience given there are a number of things that could go wrong."
foxes,3appz1,th3xile,29,Mon Jun 22 19:13:43 2015 UTC,"You didn't rain on my parade at all and I wish more people were concerned with wildlife welfare like you!  I grew up in the outdoors and have a degree in biology so I feel sort of qualified to know my limits as well as those of the animals around me.  I don't recommend handling animals of any kind unless you know what your are doing.  I appreciate your concern, but the human scent aspect is actually an old wives tale concocted by people to get well meaning folks to stop ""helping"" baby animals they think are abandoned.    More info I should have included:  This den is located under our shed at my cabin, and we could hear mom under there.  Sardine was reunited with mom within 5 minutes.  As for biting and scratching, it is hard to tell from the picture but this baby weighed less than a pound, and I wasn't too worried about her.  Another week or 2 and it might be a different story.  When we scratched her head, she actually wagged her tail like a puppy.  A couple of times she actually almost fell asleep when My daughters held her.  (How many 6th graders can say they've held a gray fox kit!)  10/10, would do it all over again!"

I'm pretty sure this has been proven false, and the more likely reason for this myth is that it keeps children and other people from touching baby animals they probably shouldn't be.    I didn't downvote you, but that would be the likely reason.   I suspect desensitizing it to humans would be a good reason not to, but one might argue one interaction wouldn't do that."

foxes,3ana6v,Corvette512,18,Sun Jun 21 23:54:03 2015 UTC,"It sure does! Specifically, that's the Japanese word for snow.  Here is its kanji: 雪  And here is its hiragana: ゆき.  For those curious, kanji are originally Chinese characters that are used to suit Japanese needs, and while some characters retain their original Chinese pronunciation (heavily modified owing to differences between the Chinese and Japanese languages), many are given entirely different Japanese pronunciations, while still holding their original Chinese meaning. In this case, the Japanese pronunciation for the kanji 雪 is ""Yuki,"" while the Chinese pronunciation is closer to ""Seshi,"" although that may not be quite exact. It's really cool how two fundamentally different languages share the same characters.  While not quite as literally symbolic, hiragana is one of two Japanese syllebaries used to spell out words that lack their own kanji. It's similar in concept to an alphabet, such as ours, but works fundamentally different in that every single character produces a preset sound. This means that it is basically impossible to mispronounce or misspell Japanese words written in hiragana. Yuki can be written as ゆ, or ""yu,"" and き, or ""ki."" There is no other possible interpretation for those characters; it is set in stone, unlike the various potential pronunciations for the same letter combinations that exist in the Latin alphabet we use.  Another word that utilizes the character き is the Japanese word for fox: きつね, pronounced ""Kitsune."" And of course, like most Japanese nouns, this word also possesses its own kanji: 狐.  Honestly, I think both Kitsune and Yuki are adorable. Try them out and see which one you like, OP!"

That's probably the biggest reason why I love Japanese; even though I don't understand many words, it's easy to pick out the syllables because they're so well enunciated. Esperanto does something similar with the Latin alphabet and it works pretty well."

foxes,3ajxrr,Rikev,13,Sun Jun 21 03:21:03 2015 UTC,"To put it simply, its always about him.  His sleep schedule has become mine.  I often have to stop what I'm doing to check on him or give him something he needs.  The potty pad goes where he goes, not the other way around.  I've also never worried more in my life.  He's very good, but I want him to be happy and healthy, and he spends the work day alone.  That said, I love it.  He's much more cuddly than I ever thought he would.  He's bonded to me and likes to give me kisses on the lips and perch up on my shoulder for love and naps (he's actually there now!).  He's fun to watch, and so fun to play with.  With THAT said, please make sure a fox is right for you.  I've been thinking about this since I was in kindergarten, and planning for it seriously for the better part of a decade.  They do not rehome like dogs and cats do, and they're much harder to take care of in every way.  Of course, if you know that you want a fox, its just as rewarding in the end :)"

foxes,3abei9,Newtothisredditbiz,5,Fri Jun 19 00:13:35 2015 UTC,"I didnt deny it was fed?  and every day animals die out and loose their homes.... the point i was making is.... that I dont think many animals died out because a human fed them.   it honestly wasnt that hard to get.  im not going to call into question that you love animals. but know that I do too. I fund raise for the protection of foxes and deer and am currently campaigning to ban fox hunting and the use of hounds in Northern Ireland. I also volunteer at my local animal shelter. and donate what I can abroad to stop the cull of badgers both in Northern Ireland and in England. I liked this picture because it shows the beauty of the animal regardless of the OPs decision to feed it (as a response to my ""uninformed"" decision)"

foxes,39qbx9,8bitretroshit,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:22:24 2015 UTC,"People who hunt foxes on horseback with hounds rarely if ever kill the foxes. The whole point is the dog work, the fan fair, horseback riding etc.   Fun fact: foxes who are frequently hunted wih hounds actually learn tricks and are able to outsmart them by doubling back, running thro creeks etc.   People who hunt foxes and kill them do so with rifles using the sounds of dying animals.   Now to address the reason we are allowed to hunt foxes. Biting is regulated, certain species in certain states can be hunted and there are daily limits of what can be hunted according to the population of said animals based on the pervious years counts etc. It's actually an incredibly complex system regulated in most part by state governments."
foxes,39qbx9,Sdmonster,4,Sat Jun 13 23:26:35 2015 UTC,"You seem to be talking about how it works in the states.  I'm talking about over here in the UK.  Over here, they often let the pack of hounds literally tear the fox limb from limb.  No humane shot to the head.  And as far as I'm aware there's no real regulations limiting how many foxes they can kill. The fact they kill so few per hunt is probably down to the fox's generally solitary nature through the year, which spreads them out."
foxes,39qbx9,Sdmonster,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:51:52 2015 UTC,It's illegal to hunt fox with hounds in the uk. Since this ban has occurred however the number of foxes killed has reportedly gone UP. Again. Foxes typically weren't killed. The chase was far more important than killing the fox
foxes,39qbx9,eanayo,2,Sun Jun 14 14:34:57 2015 UTC,"The chase was far more important than killing the fox    Except that the chase itself can kill or seriously harm the fox, and I really don't see how the ""positive"" aspect of being chased you mention in your fist post can outweigh the horrors of being chased: Cooper's story   However, its life-threatening condition was not caused by the bites Copper had received, but by extreme stress - caused by the prolonged chase of the hunt.

foxes,392385,RepoMan555,14,Mon Jun 8 18:15:34 2015 UTC,"My husband and I own an exotic animal farm and I'm currently bottle feeding 20 arctic fox kits. We sell them as pets, but there is usually a 6 month waiting period where we ask that our clients do tons of research and begin getting their house and an enclosure ready for the kit. We bottle feed the babies to help bond them to humans. We chose arctics because they are smaller than traditional reds and are not native to where we live so they do not require DNR paperwork, but we are a USDA licensed facility.  In the end, a fox is a fox, not a dog or a cat. There are similarities to the two but a fox will still retain some of that wildness. Cats and dogs have been domesticated for thousands of years, foxes have only been domesticated for a couple of centuries at the most. They are incredibly intelligent and like to play a lot. Because they are so smart they are very good at escaping enclosures, which seems to be the thing that brings them the most trouble. People aren't used to seeing pet foxes and may feel threatened by them or annoyed with the smells and sounds they produce. So the first thing is making sure you have the ability to house them in a large outdoor area that they will not escape that is far enough from neighbors or other animals that may be bothered by them. (Also of course, you first need to check the legality of owning one in your country/state/province/county/local municipality. They could all have very different laws and you are subject to all of them.)  I only keep the kits in the house while they are babies and once they are old enough to eat solids and know how to regulate their body temp by moving in and out of the shade, they will live in an enclosure outside. Some people will keep them in their house, but their urine smells really bad and it takes months and months of work to house train them. They will also dig at and chew things in your house just as they would outside. An enclosure will need a cement floor, welded metal fencing walls and a top so that they do not climb over the fencing. They need shade, a den box, rocks and logs to climb toys and food and water.  Foxes can be fed cat kibble but will not survive on that alone. We suggest supplementing with raw meat, eggs, veggies and berries. They are pretty voracious eaters too. In the end, we have setups similar to a zoo and I enjoy watching them play together and hearing them yip with excitement whenever I'm near their enclosure. We play with sticks and toys but there is always the chance I'm going to get bit, even if it is just playful.  I suggest a fox for someone who is going to revolve most of their free time around owning it and spending time on its care and maintenance. It's not something you get because you think they are cute and want to say you have one. Even with all of the screening we go through with clients, we usually end up with at least one of the kits coming back to live with us because someone didn't understand the commitment it takes."

foxes,392385,wolf2600,28,Tue Jun 9 12:58:51 2015 UTC,Check your laws first.
foxes,392385,Kanthes,26,Mon Jun 8 18:24:52 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be brutally honest here. If you're new to foxes and want to adopt a fox kit.. Don't.  First of all, fox ownership is still a very legally grey area. Check your local laws very carefully.  Second of all, a fox is a very high maintenance pet. They must have an outdoor AND indoor enclosure, are very destructive, and will generally speaking not get along with strangers at all until carefully socialized with each new person over a longer period of time.  They are not like owning a dog at all.  If you still want to go through with it, I would suggest reading up basically every little bit of information you can, sparing no expenses, and taking a long time to make a decision/preparing your home before actually going through with it."

foxes,383wob,Darfeel,35,Mon Jun 1 20:54:20 2015 UTC,"All of the ""it's a wild animal"" aside, I have owned several species of fox and my husband raises native and exotic animals as his full time job. My guess is this little guy might not be able to eat solids on his own yet. Goat milk is the closest thing you will be able to get to his mother's milk. At his age we usually feed our foxes a blended mash of wet canned puppy food (or any type of cooked chicken or beef), mixed veggies (cooked) and goat milk. We feed the kits this mash 3 times a day and water as needed. Foxes are pretty aggressive eaters and may nip and growl when fed.  If you plan on keeping him inside with you right now, beware fox urine is incredibly smelly. Foxes can be litter trained (I recommend using sand) but it takes months of dedicated work.  The saying ""sly as a fox"" is no joke. This little guy will do anything to escape if given the chance. If you plan to keep him long-term, you will need to provide him with a kennel with a top, bottom and sides that he will not be able to chew, dig or push through. I recommend a cement floor covered in dirt and welded wire fencing on top as well as perimeter. Provide shade, shelter and logs, rocks and other things to climb on and explore.   I trust you feel you are doing what's best for this little guy, and feel free to PM me any questions. Best of luck.  Edit- Just noticed you mentioned having dogs. Rabies vaccinations are not proven effective in foxes but it would be a good idea to get a distemper vaccination for the fox (you can use the same one you would give a puppy) and treat it for worms as well. I would keep him away from your dogs until he has adjusted to being with you and then introduce them slowly. Foxes always have a chance to go back into that wild animal, even if domesticated, and I don't recommend leaving them alone with a pet ever."

foxes,383wob,screwdriver67,17,Mon Jun 1 21:52:58 2015 UTC,Can you provide how much land you have and if you can dedicate a portion towards a LARGE enclosure? The breeds of the 12 dogs would also be helpful in determining the likely hood of them accepting a fox into there area. I hope someone that is a licensed exotic animal permit holder will come by to actually give you answers. Maybe /u/banjosuicide?
foxes,383wob,banjosuicide,13,Mon Jun 1 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have ALOT of land as I'm on our ranch. I'm in the process of building a kennel or runner or whatever you want to call it. The dogs are of varied breeds, I have various types of shepherds, a Pit, Cane Corsos, etc."
foxes,383wob,banjosuicide,22,Mon Jun 1 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"I would recommend the first thing you should do is find a vet in your area that is capable of treating foxes. Then get the little guy a rabies shot along with worms, fleas and other preventable diseases shots. This is very important since you are planning on having the fox around your 12 dogs and maybe family. Also, finding out how old and what gender the fox is important."
foxes,383wob,bootsiekitty,11,Mon Jun 1 19:38:25 2015 UTC,Rabies shots are not proven effective in foxes. Distemper would be the most important followed by worming. If OP gives his dogs their shots himself he should be able to give the fox the same.
foxes,383wob,mexicansmurf,14,Tue Jun 2 00:24:03 2015 UTC,"A fox kennel must be set deep into the ground, ideally on poured concrete. Foxes are serious, serious diggers.  In terms of socializing the fox to be around dogs, you could do it slowly and cautiously. Put them in cages near each other and see how they do. Supervise one on one time with the fox and say, your friendliest dog. It will always be somewhat of a risk though, both to the fox and to your dogs, even if they seem to get along well under supervision."
foxes,383wob,Shovelfighter32,6,Mon Jun 1 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'm using mesh fencing (the thick kind) that you can put into the ground. building it for 12 dogs so I can start breeding as well."
foxes,383wob,DJBBear,6,Mon Jun 1 19:49:24 2015 UTC,Just be aware that a fox will dig and bend that wire until they find a way out. Something my dogs have never gotten out of a fox was determined enough to find a way.
foxes,383wob,Zack4568,2,Tue Jun 2 00:22:10 2015 UTC,"Its the thick kind of welded wire fence, he won't be able to bend or break it, and I'm putting it into the ground pretty deep so I hope he won't be able to dig that far."
foxes,383wob,Hyndis,3,Tue Jun 2 04:50:26 2015 UTC,"We're telling you not to underestimate the ability of a sneaky fox to escape. You really shouldn't just ""hope"" your plans are good enough. A straight fence into dirt is not good enough. The fence should go either into a solid material like concrete,  or it should curve under at a right angle underground at the bottom like _|  Because you're raising the fox kit as a pet, it will not be prepared to take care of itself in the wild if it happens to find a way to escape later in life. If you choose to raise it in captivity, you should be committed to taking the appropriate precautions to keep it in captivity."
foxes,383wob,Darfeel,6,Tue Jun 2 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"My experience with my fennec fox has shown me that foxes can get along well with other animals (cat, ferret, and hamster in my experience) so it might work out for you as long as all of the dogs are accepting of the fox. I've seen videos of foxes and dogs getting along well, so it's possible that your dogs might accept a fox.  First I'd check to make sure it's legal to own a fox in Sicily. If they're legal, or if you can get a permit, find a vet that will work with a fox. If you can't find a vet, I'd suggest checking with any local wildlife rehabilitation organisations. If there are no vets, it's probably not best for the fox for you to hang on to it, as it'll eventually need to see a vet for some reason or another.  Just so you're prepared, foxes take a LOT of time and energy in order to be made friendly. In terms of training, they're nothing like a dog. In comparison, they're stupid (but wily) and wilful. Foxes can be loving, but it's no guarantee from what I've heard from other fox owners.   If you keep the fox, tell your neighbours and get a bright collar.  I'm assuming that ranchers in Sicily would see a fox as a predator. You wouldn't want one of them shooting your fox if it got out and roamed off of your property.  edit: For food, a high quality dog food is fine. Just avoid grains, as they will give a fox the runs pretty bad.  Best of luck!"
foxes,383wob,arcanascu,3,Tue Jun 2 04:06:19 2015 UTC,"I would like them to get along but if they don't it won't be the end of the world. I would still have to keep them separated. The vet will be coming as soon as possible since its a holiday here in Italy.  Thanks for the advice on the food, wasn't sure if they ate dog food or not."
foxes,383wob,arcanascu,3,Tue Jun 2 04:45:13 2015 UTC,"I'd like to provide advice, but don't have any experience with free range foxes or anything other than a fennec. I'll give what advice I can in a reply to /u/mynameismarco"

foxes,383wob,Impostor1089,13,Tue Jun 2 04:45:19 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I have not raised foxes by myself, but I volunteer at a place where I feed a red fox and two arctic foxes regularly. When I prepare a dish, it usually contains dog kibble, wet dog food, and a mouse. We add some cooked sweet potato/carrots sometimes, blueberries, blackberries, and apple chunks. They also love scrambled egg. However, those are all adult foxes. The young one might need special nutrients that my meal prep does not account for. Definitely look online to find advice from people who have raised them from young. Good luck!"

foxes,383wob,Seruang,6,Mon Jun 1 22:00:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, me and my family were in the same boat. My dad found a fox on the side of the road that was extremely malnourished and blind. He brought her back home and we nursed her back to health, wen restoring his site. What we did was gave it some formula and wet dog food, small amounts whenever it's hungry. We also put blankets propped up, in cardboard boxes, and under beds and whatnot to try and make a den-like bed for her. We ended up giving her to a rehabilitator to be able to better take care of her and train her to be released into the wild, but I've also heard from people that they are pretty easy to tame."
foxes,383wob,bigmaclt77,3,Tue Jun 2 01:57:01 2015 UTC,"Sitting here at my comp jealous.....but anyways, one thing I do recommend is recognizing that if you do plan to actually keep it, hand feeding is going to be a mandatory thing.   Most people when they get a pet fox will receive them at about this age, and not much older, because this is a bonding age. In other words, if you take care of this fox at this age, it's going to bond to you, therefor making a raise and release VERY hard to do.   On that note, bottle feeding him and cuddling him will get him accustomed to you and he may claim you as ""mother"".   Best of luck and keep us posted!"
foxes,383wob,txzyclon,13,Tue Jun 2 06:30:31 2015 UTC,"First off, raising a red fox is something that is not only very challenging but it also might be illegal depending on where you are located. Its probably not something you should do. A fox is not a dog. A fox is a wild animal. Do not think of a fox as just a dog, its not going to work and its only going to end in tragedy.  Is the mother nearby? Its best if you return the cub to its mother. The best possible outcome is that the mother finds the cub and takes care of it.  If you are unable to return the cub to its mother then contact a local wildlife rehabilitation organization. Without knowing where you are located there's no way to give specifics, but there will be some sort of wildlife rehabilitation group in your area. Google search for ""wildlife rehabilitation [your city/county here]"". Contact them."
foxes,383wob,sailorbob134280,19,Mon Jun 1 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"Im in rural sicily with plenty of land and resources to raise it. It's not going to be hard for me, I was just looking for tips. There is no wildlife rehab of the sorts. People don't generally care for animals here. The mother was hit by a car as far as I can tell."
foxes,383wob,allthefoxes,17,Mon Jun 1 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"Can you please update your original post with your location, what happened to the mother and finally the reason you are planning on keeping the pup?

foxes,383wob,sailorbob134280,6,Mon Jun 1 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"Just curious, not bashing or anything, but why do you think that the mother was hit by a car? I know that often people get concerned for young animals that are seemingly abandoned and can rescue them while the adults aren't around.   Here's a link I found that looks useful for at least the first couple days with your fluffball, you can ignore the take it to a center bit but you can see some ideas of what you could do that a shelter would do."

foxes,383wob,Boston_Jason,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:48:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's pretty reasonable evidence. Good on you for stepping up to save the little guy, and good luck!"
foxes,383wob,allthefoxes,4,Tue Jun 9 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"Look up the laws in your country around fox ownership, because you need to find a vet that is willing to deal with foxes and that is hard enough to do when foxes are legal.  When he's a bit bigger you'll want to build an enclosure and secure it really really well; floor, walks and ceiling all need to be fox proof.    Desexing is a must, and you'll want to vaccinate as well the same way you do for dogs. This is where you need a really good vet.  You're committing to over a decade of looking after that cute little furry asshole, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself in for."
foxes,383wob,Boston_Jason,23,Tue Jun 2 05:37:33 2015 UTC,"You should take it to an animal rescue. You really should not try to raise a fox. They are wild animals, they are not dogs.   Edit: I'm not trying to discredit you or call you a liar, but I just think it would settle some things if you maybe gave us some pictures of your farm, with evidence that you are present there, to assuage some of people's concerns for your abilities to raise this fox. If you have so many animals, it seems strange you would need to consult us for advice."

foxes,383wob,SaucyPots0502,-17,Tue Jun 2 02:13:48 2015 UTC,If you care about that kit at all you will give it to animal rescue so they can take proper care of it.
foxes,383wob,duremville,53,Mon Jun 1 20:03:49 2015 UTC,like I said earlier. no one here cares about animals. there is no animal rescue. there are hundreds of dogs that roam the streets. so I doubt a fox is something people are interested in seeing live. people here are cruel to animals.
foxes,383wob,pileated_peckerwood,56,Mon Jun 1 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"I'm genuinely embarassed and saddened by the attitude in this thread. I think most comments here must be from people from America or similarily rich countries that can't concieve that there might simply not be a suitable animal rescue to give a fox up to, no professional wildlife rehabilitator to take it off your hands. As someone who grew up in a place where the only solution to your problem would be to shoot the animal dead, or just let it die in a hole - I'm happy you decided to help as best as you can, you're a good person for it, thank you."

Worse than killing it or letting it die in the wild? What do you want him to do, fly it out to mainland Italy to give to a rescue center so it can live the same existence there? Are you going to fund that trip?  I'd expect better than this from a mod, you don't offer a solution at all. What, you can't take the time out of your busy day to at least offer a solution?

foxes,383wob,orost,17,Tue Jun 2 06:34:44 2015 UTC,"So be it.   You're totally entitled to your opinion, and I respect that. But the fact that you continue to berate him for 'asking advice while already having his mind made up' indicates that you did not read his post fully before rendering judgement. This is disappointing for a mod, especially one of so many subs (yes, I briefly checked your profile). As a mod, you should be setting a standard for the quality of comments on any sub you care for. I would certainly hope that this is not that standard.   If you would like to steer OP away from caring for the fox, a helpful comment would be more useful than a pretentious one. For example, giving OP an actual solution as to what he/she SHOULD do instead of telling them that their current method of helping is ""basically the worst thing OP could do."" I can see that you have strong opinions about this particular situation, but the least you could do is not be an assclown about it. Or ya know, not post if you don't have something constructive to say.   Normally, I'd side with you. Foxes are wild animals. But reading the other posts here, there's really not much of an option. At least OP is reaching out to a community for help rather than just winging it and hoping for the best."
foxes,383wob,FifteenthPen,2,Tue Jun 2 03:36:43 2015 UTC,I don't think he should raise a fox.   What do you think he should do?

foxes,379efu,Picaroon,6,Mon May 25 23:10:33 2015 UTC,"Foxes have a huge vocal range.  If they sound like tropical birds they are babies wanting food or attention, if they sound like a dog barking with a throat full of phlegm that is a warning bark to alert other foxes to danger, if they make a chittering nose they are fighting, if they cough from the back of their throat they are warning you to leave them alone, if they sound like a dog being murdered they are really happy, if they sound like a woman screaming they are horny."
foxes,379efu,DrStalker,3,Tue May 26 12:22:09 2015 UTC,"I spent 45 minutes bushwhacking before I got close enough to tell this wasn't human. By then I had to keep looking just to make sure. Finally got a glimpse of two glowing eyes, you can just make them out in the video.   Is it common for foxes to scream like this? I've spent a lot of time in the woods, I can't remember hearing anything like this before."
foxes,379efu,ThatEvilCreeper,2,Mon May 25 23:14:52 2015 UTC,"Can't confirm from personal experience, but I've heard that foxes make noises like this all the time."
foxes,379efu,zerobeat,2,Tue May 26 05:34:06 2015 UTC,Yep. That's the standard call they make.   Just wait until winter when they start looking for love and the bark turns into a shrill scream that sounds like someone being murdered.
foxes,379efu,Kanthes,2,Tue May 26 11:15:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's a fox cry alright! Like this, for example.  It's apparently fairly common for police to be notified when people mistake it as a human woman screaming, mistaking it for a human woman in distress."
foxes,374qmj,arowberry,3,Sun May 24 21:30:00 2015 UTC,"Took this one whilst staying in the mountain refuge (4,810m) on Cotopaxi, an active volcano in Ecuador.  I like this photo, but the graffiti is irritating. Lousy Vicente..."

foxes,36uwku,digitalastronaut,8,Fri May 22 09:12:06 2015 UTC,I've been trying to participate in the Shirt Woot derby more this year and the theme this weekend is Low Poly. It's a pocket design for a shirt so would look this this:  http://i.imgur.com/0hqxVuk.jpg   I've not tried anything like that before so found it really hard but I hope you guys like it.
foxes,36uwku,Rhynocerous,3,Fri May 22 09:14:56 2015 UTC,"I like it, I'd vote for it if I was eligible.   If you want some constructed feedback, the polygon colors on the fox's forehead don't give the right illusion of depth but you might not have even been going for that. It probably looks fine on a shirt though."
foxes,36uwku,blackadder1132,3,Fri May 22 20:29:12 2015 UTC,Thanks!   I only worked on it for a few hours and this was my first ever low poly design so I made MANY mistakes lol I agree though - it's not quite right on the forehead!  I think I want to do more though and foxes seem to look awesome in  low poly style so I will practice on them :)

My last dog, Heather, was a rough collie very much like the one pictured here. I told her everything about my life - it was therapeutic for me to speak out loud about things weighing on me even if I was only talking to myself. The night before my stepdad took her to be put down I sat next to her in the basement, pressed my face into her fur, and just cried until I had nothing left. I remember her concerned look at my behavior, and she licked the salty tears from my face as if to say, ""it's OK..."".   Now I'm crying again. I'll never get over losing her I miss her so much.

The dogs known as foxes include the Pampas Fox, Crab-eating Fox and Darwin's Fox, but the only really odd one I can find for foxes is the Bat-eared fox which is neither Canini nor Vulpini, but Basal Caninae, along with the Raccoon dog (despite the two species being almost literally half the globe apart.)"

foxes,35316o,DrStalker,10,Wed May 6 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"It's a red fox, Vulpes Vulpes.    This one is old enough to grown out of his grey fuzzy coat and into his proper foxy colours, but is clearly still quite young."
foxes,35316o,ncolaros,3,Thu May 7 01:16:11 2015 UTC,The real question: can I have one as a pet?
foxes,35316o,DrStalker,12,Thu May 7 01:20:14 2015 UTC,"Where do you live?  I've in NSW Australia and have pet foxes, but they were rescued before the laws changed last year.  If you're in the USA you need to look up both state and local laws.  Just as important as the legality is knowing what you are getting yourself in for; foxes are a decade+ commitment, they are a lot more work than a cat or dog and they behave like foxes, not a domesticated pet.  They are lovely animals, and I'm very happy to work with them, but do your research first including getting to know existing owners!"
foxes,35316o,ncolaros,3,Thu May 7 01:33:43 2015 UTC,Good advice. Thanks.

Personally I think that willingness and reliability are the most important traits for volunteers, but as I mentioned I don't have any official position within SFR so I'm just speaking from personal experience here. (sorry about the excessive disclaimers, but if I don't put them in there's a risk that something crazy will end up in the media attributed to SFR instead of me.)"

I'd actually managed to actually get a real submission form just beforehand... kind of sad, heh.  I so hope this works out...  Hrm. I haven't really volunteered for anything notable yet, but... you do make some valid points. You kind of have to decide yes, this is a good idea and commit to that from within because money isn't present to play the incentive and manufacture loyalty.  Hopefully I can get an idea what volunteering requires, actually get to pet a fox, and decide how well I think I'd go."

foxes,34ypk7,aneffinyank,2,Wed May 6 01:56:11 2015 UTC,"Fun fact regarding this terminology: It's called ""blowing a raspberry"" because of rhyming slang: that is, taking a word, replacing it with a phrase that rhymes with it, and dropping all but the first word.  The act sounds like a fart, ""fart"" rhymes with ""raspberry tart,"" and only ""raspberry"" is kept, so ""blowing a fart"" becomes ""blowing a raspberry."""

foxes,34fqhl,Zemedelphos,17,Fri May 1 04:55:18 2015 UTC,"Ears back is a sign of submission to a dominant animal (in this case, the fox's owner), but there's no arched body so this is not a fearful submission. Additionally, you can see the ears flicking when inspecting the ball, so curiosity is being shown. The tail wag and other body postures indicate playfulness. Vocalization indicates excitement.  Pretty much exactly what you'd see in a domestic dog with a few very slight variations that account for foxes being mostly solitary compared to dogs."

foxes,34fqhl,T-MoneyAllDey,3,Fri May 1 05:51:36 2015 UTC,"Many animals show submission when they're comfortable.  As an example, cats do the same thing all the time. When a cat rolls over and exposes its belly to you this is the cat's way of telling you its comfortable enough with you that it doesn't care about being vulnerable to you. It shows its vulnerable belly as proof of this.  The cat isn't actually inviting bellyrubs which is why you'll probably get clawed, but merely showing you its belly means the cat is both submissive to you and also very comfortable with you."
foxes,34fqhl,Hyndis,-1,Fri May 1 08:22:52 2015 UTC,"I know that (i'm a cat owner), but I mean the particular method of submission in foxes triggers a bit of a pity response in me."

foxes,3492nu,Zemedelphos,7,Wed Apr 29 17:40:04 2015 UTC,Okay that's really misleading. The fox did not even make a sandwich. It stacked the meat on three pieces of bread and left.
foxes,3492nu,shleepwns,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:38:06 2015 UTC,How is that not a sandwich?
foxes,3492nu,Zemedelphos,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:09:45 2015 UTC,"Sandwiches are bread, meat/egg/peanutbutter/etc., optional contents, bread.  Sandwiches are not meat, bread, bread, bread, bread."
foxes,3492nu,shleepwns,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:43:46 2015 UTC,"True, however, though the video cuts multiple times for length purposes you can't exactly be certain there isn't more meat in between those other pieces of bread.. Regardless, Mr(s). Fox is a smarty pants, and I applaud his/her ingenuity."
foxes,3492nu,Zemedelphos,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:09:42 2015 UTC,You can see the first piece of meat is about 3/5ths the thickness of the breads. You can't see any gaps between the four pieces of bread.

foxes,32pwko,SRSco,14,Wed Apr 15 23:53:17 2015 UTC,I'd normally agree but in this case it looks like she's wearing some kind of uniform so in this case she's probably not just an exotic pet owner.

foxes,327t0y,FatherJackal,3,Sat Apr 11 12:24:53 2015 UTC,"Not really, they either keep the enclosure very clean or its buried or something... The smell of fox piss is acrid though, the type of smell that sticks to your brain for a few hours after."

It took me three solid months of work (probably about 250 hours?) to complete but it was all worth it in the end!

If you're considering sewing it yourself, I'll say that the pattern isn't very well made--I believe it may have been thrown into a pattern maker and then placed on the site without being tested. There's a confetti in there that doesn't make a lot of sense, but if you want a challenge/big piece, this is a great pattern to try!"

foxes,325gjb,allthefoxes,9,Fri Apr 10 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"This arctic fox named «Gandalf» has blue eyes because he suffered eye degeneration, it is impossible to be reinserted in the wildlife safely. He was diagnosed with the disease since birth and has adapted its meaning in order to get around in its habitat. It remains very strong with excellent interaction with its environment. Its fur is brown in summer. I do not know why it is still white at this time of the year."

foxes,31zv89,Focie,5,Thu Apr 9 14:41:55 2015 UTC,It was probably just inspecting the foreign object in its territory. Bears have been photographed doing the same thing. It's just curiousity.

I've come across a couple in the wild and have worked with many in bio. I know that taxidermists also see these quite a bit. They're interesting colors!

foxes,31fylg,DrStalker,1 point,Sun Apr 5 09:51:01 2015 UTC,"The Easter bunny bringing eggs to children can be traced back to Germany. German and Dutch settlers brought the tradition to the US in the 18th Century. But in some parts of the country children used to wait for the Easter fox or a stork instead to bring them their gifts. The bunny has now taken over, however."
foxes,31d23u,Rekaze,36,Fri Apr 3 22:42:32 2015 UTC,It's interesting how animals interact when you take murderous hunger out of the equation.    Maybe all predators are just big snuggle fucks if they are well fed.

foxes,31d23u,CedarWolf,7,Sat Apr 4 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"It's not as simple as hunger.  Mammals need ""families.""  Especially baby animals.  Eg: When baby Rhinos lose their moms because of poachers, they can actually die from stress.  It's like when you have to go somewhere stressful, you want someone to come with you.  There are many reasons, and we don't know that much.  Animal Odd Couples"

foxes,30q461,haleycaulfield,23,Sun Mar 29 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"Foxes take a long time to warm up to new people.  Rarely they will instantly decide they love or hate someone, normally it's a lot of ""I don't know you and I don't like you being here!"" until you spend a lot of time letting them get to know you.  tl:dr; he doesn't hate you, he hates everyone."

foxes,30rq1l,NAbsentia,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:27:13 2015 UTC,"is there more than one type of island fox? if not I think I'm familiar with these things.  it's been ages so my memory is fuzzy but I did some research on these little guys, basically they are spread out across several islands off the coast of california, and are basically smaller grey foxes, now due to the small size of their ecosystems their populations are very precarious and prone to dropping rapidly. In the past major threats that have pushed them to the brink of extinction included the introduction of people to the islands, which caused the foxes to be almost wiped out by diseases brought with the pets of these people, and then the use of pesticides in the region caused a decline in bald eagles, which led to an increase in golden eagles, who decided that the island foxes were quite tasty and then hunted them back to the brink. Though in all cases the foxes have remained on all islands in some number to my knowledge, and with some intervention their populations have recovered."
foxes,30rq1l,Yetanotherfurry,2,Mon Mar 30 22:04:03 2015 UTC,"IIRC, there are four ""island"" foxes, each indigenous to one of the Channel Islands. Santa Catalina's foxes were reduced just as you describe: humans, their pets, pesticides, golden eagles. They've largely recovered since being protected. Since Catalina is the only island with a permanent human settlement of any consequence, its foxes were more endangered than the other islands' foxes. Recent news stories report that the Catalina Island Fox is doing well again."
foxes,30rq1l,Yetanotherfurry,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"thanks for the clarification, I didn't do much research on the actual islands and it was quite some time ago that I did the reading.

foxes,3006p2,Polar_Snow_Fox,9,Mon Mar 23 12:23:55 2015 UTC,"How? At first I thought albino, but the eyes are yellow."
foxes,3006p2,Adam_the_Penguin,8,Mon Mar 23 12:43:19 2015 UTC,"It's probably either leucistic or just has genes for white fur.  Fox coloring is really interesting. In the last 50 years, we've been the first humans to see what happens to foxes when their MC1R proteins are allowed to mutate. I can't wait to see the first fox with point coloration. :)"
foxes,3006p2,magelanz,3,Mon Mar 23 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"I only know basic genetics, but this sounds fascinating. Could you ELI5 why that protein wasn't able to mutate before 50 years ago ? And what kind of mutations it would take for that protein to allow point colouration ?  Thanks in advance :)"
foxes,3006p2,captain_obvious_here,5,Mon Mar 23 16:55:07 2015 UTC,It's simply because of nature. Foxes with red/orange/brown colorations can simply survive and hunt easier.Imagine seeing this in a forest. It would stick out. But if we allow foxes to survive that have lighter colours then this is the outcome. I probably got  soemthing wrong since i am in no sense a an expert. But i think that's more or less it.
foxes,3006p2,-Fennekin-,11,Mon Mar 23 17:02:27 2015 UTC,"No idea how, but that's definitely not an arctic fox, because the large ears and the muzzle are these of a red/silver fox.

foxes,304t0z,Shovelfighter32,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"What I understand from the description is that the foxes can run around the entire flat. It is just the place where they sleep on the balcony , when it gets warmer."

I also promptly made my first ever donation to National Fox Welfare Society in UK (where Pudds lived) as soon as I got to a computer.  Can you imagine the difference we could make if everyone on this sub donated even one dollar?  There are 35,447 members of this sub. We all love foxes... let's do what we can to help those who help them.  PLEASE DONATE. Click here and then click the donate link on the right of the menu bar."

If you are able to contribute even a few pounds (1 USD = 0.652388 GBP on PayPal) it would be immensely helpful to the society.  Here's a list of what difference we can make in honour of Pudding. Happy to say I bought food for two foxes in care for a week today. :)"
foxes,30045a,dv5230us,3,Tue Mar 24 07:54:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much!  Just for the record, I'm not affiliated with them in any way, and I also live in the US (Boston area).  But I have been keeping up with them for a year or two, and they are an amazing organization that does great work to help sick or injured foxes all across UK.  Thank you so much for your support in honor of sweet little Pudding Pop... I hope other people also donate to NFWS, or any of the other great fox rescue organizations such as Nuneaton & Warwickshire Wildlife Sanctuary in the UK, or Fox Wood Wildlife Rescue here in the US / upstate NY.  There are many others... these are just a few I know about."
foxes,30045a,theadguy,2,Tue Mar 24 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"Affiliation or not, it's all part of our little community so it's nice to help if we can. :) They are amazing and do incredible work.   I live in the Salt Lake City area and did a quick search for something like that out here, but I don't believe we see enough foxes out West to have a wildlife rescue for them... The closest thing we have is the Humane Society which deals mainly with dogs & cats. Would've loved to volunteer with something like the NFWS though."
foxes,30045a,dv5230us,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:43:16 2015 UTC,I think if you Google wildlife rehabilitation and your state you should find a similar organization.  I think every state has at least one.  They are sometimes very small but could always use help at this time of year most of all.

foxes,30045a,AvalonBright,8,Tue Mar 24 04:45:40 2015 UTC,"This is very sad news.  People may be getting tired of these posts from me, but I feel compelled to point out that while there is no way to bring Pudding back, humans unnecessarily kill billions of animals every year that are as worthy of compassion and caring treatment as Pudding was.   We kill more animals in first world countries every 10 years than the total number of humans that ever existed, and the majority of them are treated very poorly. Most castrations are done without anesthesia, and in the US at least there isn't even an available drug for pain relief which I think is quite telling.  The reason I'm motivated to make these posts is that it's clear that you, dear reader, care about animals as individuals. A lot of people don't. It may be easier than you'd think to extend that compassion and empathy to animals other than foxes, and even gradual changes or reductions in consumption can make a meaningful difference.  Thank you for reading through."

foxes,30045a,Vulpyne,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:43:21 2015 UTC,Your post intends upon profiting (by values however good intention) on the harm or trauma of others. Exploiting vulnerabilities. It's a very nasty thing to do. It's like selling life insurance at funerals to mourners.  PUDDING DIED BECAUSE PEOPLE EAT MEAT LOLZ  I mean what are you even doing.
foxes,30045a,SekondaH,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:46:59 2015 UTC,"Your post intends upon profiting (by values however good intention) on the harm or trauma of others.   But I'm not profiting.    It's like selling life insurance at funerals to mourners.   A salesperson selling life insurance at funerals is doing so to profit themselves. Again, my post doesn't benefit me personally at all.   PUDDING DIED BECAUSE PEOPLE EAT MEAT LOLZ   I never said anything remotely like that. The point is that it doesn't make a lot of sense to be ""harmed"" or ""traumatized"" by the death of one animal (that these people have never even met) while at the same time causing death and suffering to other animals that are just as deserving of compassion.   People mourning Pudding have demonstrated that they are capable of regarding animals as individuals and so they may be receptive to having this inconsistency pointed out. If they are, and they amend their behavior then that means less death and suffering all around.   I mean what are you even doing.   I'm trying to reduce the amount of needless death and suffering people cause. Is that something you oppose? I might ask you the same question. What are you trying to accomplish here with your insinuations that I'm a sociopath and your hostile tone?"

For someone with great introspectively positioned analysis co to he to step back to the third person em pathetically and you'll see how it contributes nothing but negatives.   I don't really know what you're trying to say here in the first part of the sentence. I will note though that the post you're talking about has a total karma score of 10. That means at least 10 more people voted it up than those voted it down and since /r/foxes is a fairly small subreddit it's unlikely that a huge amount of people voted so it's not likely that the total score was something like -1000/+1010 or whatever. I'd say it was generally received in a positive way, and even if people didn't agree with what I was saying they had some respect for what I was trying to accomplish."

We just subscribe and wait for something to pop up on the front page. To me, that's the point of reddit: see a whole bunch of information from different sources and communities all at once. Even with how often I'm on reddit though (it's like an obsession), I miss things.  Also, I just checked the frontpage of /r/foxes by clicking on the ""FOXES"" text at the top, and didn't see it anywhere within the first three pages. That goes back 19 days ago."

foxes,2zbv38,DeathTails,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:37:40 2015 UTC,"If you can't discern whether it's a painting or photo-shop, then the skill level was probably above poor.  It's a filtered photo of some sort, either a high-quality photoshop-plugin, or a lot of care was given to instructing the application how to blend and filter the colors. There are filters that automatically create effects like this, but they are generic enough that you wouldn't have to ask the question ""painting or photoshop""."
foxes,2zbv38,Krist-Silvershade,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:19:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think there was any care put into processing this photo at all.  The white balance looks just wrong, too cold and the crushed blacks in the background say it all along with the awkward unnaturally colored grass.  I don't have any ps experience, but I don't believe using color filters like this takes much skill.   Besides I was just joking by saying that it looked like a painting. I could already tell that it was simply a shitty photoshop attempt just by looking at the thumbnail."

foxes,2z9yux,magelanz,10,Tue Mar 17 05:03:42 2015 UTC,"Miko wasn't an albino. He was the product of selective breeding, and his coat was passed to him from his mother. So, more like an apricot. Good analogy.  Unfortunately, he's gone now. A woman broke into his owners property and killed him."

foxes,2z9yux,iplay88keys,1 point,Tue Mar 17 05:12:41 2015 UTC,"Albinism characteristically means red eyes, due to the lack of melanin (color). The red is because of the blood vessels behind the eye if I'm not mistaken."
foxes,2z9yux,_justforyou,-1,Tue Mar 17 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"That's a myth, and it would depend upon the specific genes involved that would determine eye color. Blue eyes in human albinos is extremely common. In canids, blue eyes is typical in albinos, too. Check out dogs with albinism, basically the same coloring as the non-photoshopped Miko: http://www.dogster.com/lifestyle/albino-animals-dogs-albinism-white-dog-facts  EDIT: More sources:  http://www.albinism.org/publications/what_is_albinism.html   A common myth is that people with albinism have red eyes. In fact there are different types of albinism and the amount of pigment in the eyes varies. Although some individuals with albinism have reddish or violet eyes, most have blue eyes. Some have hazel or brown eyes.    http://www.visionfortomorrow.org/albinism-faqs/   Do all people with albinism have pink eyes?  No. Most people with albinism have blue, green, hazel or even brown eyes. The pink appearance is due to the reflection of the back of the eye through a pale iris, as described above.   http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Albinism.aspx   One of the myths about albinism is that it causes people to have pink or red eyes. In fact, people with albinism can have irises varying from light gray or blue to brown. (The iris is the colored portion of the eye that controls the size of the pupil, the opening that lets light into the eye.)"

The fox in question will get enough money through the game to eventually have the shrine repaired and worked on, and will have three fox cubs by the end."

Some cultures even ascribe otherworldly magical attributes to their character, like the shape-shifting kitsune.  Apart from their cultural portrayal, foxes are simply charismatic. They're visually striking, and they carry a suave demeanor. I probably sound crazy, but there's just something about foxes that I think is awesome!  I'm also just interested in wildlife in general. It's fun to learn about how different organisms live on the planet we all share."

I also have a fox shirt I got from redditgifts, a fox calendar next to my bed, several stuffed animal foxes I have in a bin somewhere, I have three Schleich miniature fox statues, I have a giant fox blanket covering one of my windows.. and I think that's it.  No pictures, but I guess I have a bit of stuff :)  As for why.. I really don't know. I'm usually in a store, see something cool with a fox on it and buy it."

I still have him! :D My brother has been calling me Vixens ever since I can remember. They're gorgeous!  I probably have at least 20 pairs of fox socks, over 30 toys/plushes, my collection is pretty large and obsessive... I should take a picture of everything I have one day. I have a lot of different items, I forget some of the things I have sometimes.. :D"

I can post the rest when I get home tonight.  I wear a tail almost all of the time (including to bed). I'm saving up to buy a fox as a pet, and also to go to the fox village in Japan. My boyfriend and best friend both call me ""pretty pretty fox queen"". My friends call me "" fox"". I even have a favourite fox photographer, and a favourite photo from him. The first time I saw a fox in the wild, I was driving and had to pull over because I was crying of happy. I just LOVE all things foxy.  P.S. I'm not a furry."

foxes,2yjwbj,wolf2600,6,Tue Mar 10 16:14:50 2015 UTC,a la: chihuahuas.
foxes,2yjwbj,FurioVelocious,2,Tue Mar 10 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"Selective breeding also led to so many great breeds of dogs. Sure there are some ""bad"" results, but it has been mostly for the better."
foxes,2yjwbj,JSB12,9,Tue Mar 10 21:00:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say so. Mutts are all around healthier than breaded dogs.
foxes,2yjwbj,RenaKunisaki,5,Tue Mar 10 23:24:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, breading really doesn't work as well as fur."
foxes,2yjwbj,guero162,6,Wed Mar 11 02:18:54 2015 UTC,You have to dip them in egg first so the bread crumbs stick.
foxes,2yjwbj,FurioVelocious,2,Wed Mar 11 03:14:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but we wouldn't even have any of the modern mutts without selective breeding..."
foxes,2yjwbj,JSB12,4,Wed Mar 11 00:03:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly, every dog would be a mutt without selective breeding. Hence selective breeding not being very good."
foxes,2yjwbj,FurioVelocious,3,Wed Mar 11 01:11:33 2015 UTC,"Your completely missing my point. Essentially all modern mutts are a result of selective breeding, because - whether its from their great great grandparents or both of their parents - they all have selectively bred genes.  To help you understand, think of it this way: without selective breeding, every dog would basically be a wolf."
foxes,2yjwbj,JSB12,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:15:39 2015 UTC,"whether its from their great great grandparents or both of their parents - they all have selectively bred genes.   Those genes were always there, but because we've secluded breeds from other breeds they became exclusive. We've limited the gene pool because of selective breeding. That's why breeds suffer specific disabilities or diseases. A pug will have breathing problems, but when mixed with a mutt or another breed maybe it won't. A mutt is a step closer to that full gene pool."
foxes,2yjwbj,richardjohn,2,Wed Mar 11 03:15:22 2015 UTC,"There wouldn't be dogs without selective breeding, selective breeding domesticated wolves."
foxes,2yjwbj,wraithgul,-2,Wed Mar 11 09:46:37 2015 UTC,"i guess it can be accurate to say that ""modern mutts are a result of selective breeding (because of its lineage)"" but it can also be said that any wild animals are also a result of their parents (though not through manufactured selectivity).  what i think /u/JSB12 is saying is that it would likely be better for the health of dogs as a whole if there had never been, as i'll call it, ""unnatural selection."" dogs might, as a whole, be more wolf-like as mutts, but just like stray/feral (non-selectively bred) cats they'd still be diverse in their variety."
foxes,2yjwbj,BornIn1500,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:01:14 2015 UTC,You don't understand what he's saying at all.
foxes,2yjwbj,shawntails,1 point,Wed Mar 11 08:08:38 2015 UTC,Every dog would be closer to a wolf without selective breeding.
foxes,2yjwbj,Eenohay,2,Wed Mar 11 10:59:05 2015 UTC,Like pugs. God those are ugly :c
foxes,2yjwbj,TrystFox,5,Wed Mar 11 05:15:00 2015 UTC,"Not quite... back when wolves started joining humans, nobody was thinking to selectively breed wolves to make them look cute."
foxes,2yjwbj,FurioVelocious,3,Tue Mar 10 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"Right, but we were selectively breeding them to make them more docile/friendly."
foxes,2yjwbj,Rekaze,5,Tue Mar 10 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"Yup. And that turned out very well for the most part until we took it too far, but that's only in some cases."

foxes,2yjwbj,SpazCadet,3,Wed Mar 11 02:29:25 2015 UTC,"don't do it, they'll just turn into dogs.  if we're gonna domesticate them we may as well keep them foxes."

foxes,2yjwbj,SpazCadet,2,Wed Mar 11 10:57:54 2015 UTC,Why is it that it's so easy to breed selective traits into foxes specifically?
foxes,2yjwbj,A_Sly_Fox,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:52:03 2015 UTC,"It's not any easier to breed selective traits in foxes as, say, dogs. It's a matter of how often the animals reproduce, the number of generations in 20 years, that determine how quickly different traits can be bred out or in.  Probably, I'm pulling this from memory out of a high school textbook."

foxes,2yjwbj,analogWeapon,2,Wed Mar 11 05:14:23 2015 UTC,"To those comparing this breeding dogs, remember that most breeds were created to make certain tasks easier. Herding, hunting, tracking, etc. There are a few companion breeds, like the chihuahua, but they aren't nearly as prevalent as the working dogs."
foxes,2yjwbj,Tiger8566,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"What does that mean? Are you implying that domesticated working breeds are as desirable as unadulterated, wild foxes?"
foxes,2yjwbj,Lizardbowl6,2,Wed Mar 11 16:18:04 2015 UTC,"Not at all. Just saying that domestic dogs were bred for work, not for being pets. Humans only had pets when they had more free time and became more specialized as a species."
foxes,2yjwbj,Eenohay,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I guess my objection to this all is that all breeding in this age is necessarily for companionship. We don't need dogs to do most of the tasks they could do anymore. I doubt that most people who are breeding are actually doing it for that, since there exists countless existent specimens of many, many breeds already suited to do those tasks.   E: Run-on sentence from hell."
foxes,2yjwbj,Lizardbowl6,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:44:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it doesn't look... Foxy Enough? Like if i had a fox i'd want it to look like a fox, not a dog."
foxes,2yjwbj,CaffeinePowered,2,Wed Mar 11 05:59:26 2015 UTC,Just look at those paws! Have you ever seen a dog with paws this fluffy?
foxes,2yjwbj,MrGulio,-11,Wed Mar 11 06:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, let's domesticate ANOTHER beautiful wild animal. There's a good idea."
foxes,2yjwbj,analogWeapon,20,Tue Mar 10 17:26:36 2015 UTC,"Foxes are pretty much the only mammal carnivores being truly domesticated nowadays.  Cats and dogs are unique in that they are carnivores but due to breeding through thousands of years they have evolved to not be harmful to humans. No other carnivore mammal is kept as a pet commonly, and only recently (from the previous century) have foxes begun some sort of a domestication process. All other pets people keep are small herbivores or omnivores, and they are rather boring to be honest.   They have some characteristics that make them desirable, they are small and pretty and generally not harmful to people. I see them becoming mainstream pets in half a century or so."
foxes,2yjwbj,Eenohay,-21,Tue Mar 10 17:35:51 2015 UTC,...So we should continue to domesticate them? why? because they are interesting to watch and play with? what a good reason to mess with an entire species.
foxes,2yjwbj,Cephalopod_Joe,22,Tue Mar 10 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"what a good reason to mess with an entire species.    Except you don't, today we have dogs and wolves, dogs were split off into their own sub-species.  The same would be true of foxes, just because you selectively breed one that is domesticated doesn't make the wild populations magically disappear."

foxes,2yjwbj,KeplerDawg,10,Wed Mar 11 16:28:31 2015 UTC,"It's a touchy subject.  I know of the bad consequences inbreeding has on dogs because people breed them uniquely for their physical traits. I think long term domestication of some foxes is not really bad though. We wouldn't be getting rid of wild foxes, just slowly creating new domestic foxes."

foxes,2y7qbp,KingKittyWizard,4,Sat Mar 7 14:49:33 2015 UTC,"The overexposure conveys the radioactive, deadly intensity of depicted cuteness."
foxes,2y7qbp,orost,3,Sat Mar 7 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"I believe that's an intended effect, honestly it doesn't look bad to me at all.  Make sure you set the contrasts (white level) on your display properly, so that the details in the lighter white shades aren't lost. But I guess you already know this."
foxes,2y7qbp,KingKittyWizard,4,Sat Mar 7 14:59:47 2015 UTC,"It's obviously intentional, I just disagree that it looks good. There's no amount of contrast adjustment that's going to reveal the detail lost by the over-exposure or the fact that it emphasises completely the wrong parts of the image."
foxes,2y7qbp,KingKittyWizard,2,Sat Mar 7 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"I guess it still can be fixed somehow in ps, because when I tilt my laptop screen backwards, with the gamma shift I can distinctly see all the details in whites, aside from one little spot around the ear."

Over generations, the foxes took on lighter and spotted coats."
foxes,2xxox3,WakeAndVape,3,Thu Mar 5 00:30:14 2015 UTC,"That matches my understanding; there is some crossover in coat and behavior ""gene groups"" so selecting for one also affects the other."

It is also known as the Zorro Chilote or Zorro de Darwin  in Spanish and lives on Nahuelbuta National Park, (Araucanía Region), the Valdivian Coastal Range (Los Ríos Region) in mainland Chile and Chiloé Island.   Darwin's fox was first collected from San Pedro Island off the coast of Chile by the naturalist Charles Darwin in 1834. It was long held that Darwin's fox was a subspecies of the South American gray fox (L. griseus); however, the discovery of a small population of Darwin's fox on the mainland in Nahuelbuta National Park in 1990  and subsequent genetic analysis has clarified the fox's status as a unique species.  In 2012 and 2013 the presence of the Darwin's fox at Oncol Park, Alerce Costero National Park and the Valdivian Coastal Reserve was confirmed through camera trapping.

foxes,2xkhfs,babybabs,36,Sun Mar 1 15:59:53 2015 UTC,Nice! One of the better fox tatoos Ive seen around. Also definitely better than the 17 thing(what was that about anyway?)
foxes,2xkhfs,Pogonophobic_,31,Sun Mar 1 17:28:00 2015 UTC,"So the original tattoo, for which I was 17 at the time, was basically an ""I can't wait I want a tattoo now"" kinda thing. And I had this friend who was banging this tattoo artist dude and she was like let go get ours together and she had one already done by him which was beautiful, the lines and detail were so perfect, so I didn't see why not. When we got there he did hers first, which was perfect again and then when it came to mine which he did actually stencil it and the stencil looked perfect. The stencil had clean lines and I was happy with it, but he finished and I saw these scribbles of crap on my ankle that were far from what the stencil looked like. ANYWAY, the 17 stands for the number of my house in which I grew up in and my father actually built the house from the ground up. The flowers were just there so it could be pretty but clearly that didn't work out."

Mannix and illustrated by John Schoenherr. It follows the lives of Tod, a red fox raised by a human for the first year of his life, and Copper, a half-bloodhound dog owned by a local hunter, referred to as the Master. After Tod causes the death of the man's favorite hound, man and dog relentlessly hunt the fox, against the dual backdrops of a changing human world and Tod's normal life in hunting for food, seeking a mate, and defending his territory. As preparation for writing the novel, Mannix studied foxes, both tame and wild, a wide variety of hunting techniques, and the ways hounds appear to track foxes, seeking to ensure his characters acted realistically.

As soon as I zoomed in, I thought that surly this can be no more then 20MP max, and probably more like 12MP. The EXIF info from the photo says that it was taken with a Canon EOS-1D Mark III, which is only a 10,1MP camera.

foxes,2vvgk2,Kate_4_President,45,Sat Feb 14 14:22:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's Chuckles! She's one of my favorite well-known foxes!  Chuckles has brain damage, unfortunately. Fortunately, she is living permanently in the Treehouse Wildlife Center in IL.  Here is the video the gif is taken from, for anyone who wants to hear her adorable laugh.  Here is Chuckles doing her signature tail-wag.  And here is Chuckles moving into a new space with some other little fox kits.  I sorta love Chuckles :)"
