After some investigation, I found this little orange puff ball all alone with no signs of any other cats. After he tore me and my roommate up a little bit, we carried him home and he's been stuck with us ever since! Poor thing has a broken tail, though.

I had a man whose dog had 10 puppies, and we ended up with them at my clinic this spring.  We still have 4 of them and they are 4 months old already.  Stupid people are everywhere.  I had a dog present the other day for pregnancy confirmation, and the fetuses were just beginning to show on the x-rays.  The owner was upset, because she was going to get a low cost spay at the big humane society.  Turns out, they don't do ""late term abortion"" spays, but I do.  There were 8 in that bunch.    Even though our HS operates on a budget of less than $8000 a year, we do not put animals down unless there is a dangerous animal or serious health problems.  I house the animals at my clinic at no cost.  If shelters are euthanizing perfectly good and healthy puppies, they need to reassess their protocols."

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3d6c46,irishspice,65,Mon Jul 13 21:35:43 2015 UTC,"I lost my two big senior dogs within a few months of each other. My last little girl was feeling so lost and lonely I thought I'd get her a kitten since she adores cats. Nope. These two were so lost and afraid that I had to take them home. They were not at any risk of being euthanized, but I could tell when I interacted with them that they had issues.   Toto has taken nearly a year to get over his fear of hands and is still very shy when you are standing up. Obviously tall people were very scary things in his life. If I wiggle my fingers down on his level he will come over doing that ""please don't hurt me"" posture that kills me. Since he brightens up the moment I'm tickling his ears I wonder if its more habit than fear now. He's really interactive these days, demanding attention and even learning to play a little. I can't help but wonder what his life was before. :(  Annie is just in her own world, but that's okay with her. She processes information at the speed of a snail...a very slow snail. You can start scratching her and it takes her a while to react to it. She will enjoy it for a minute or two and then just wander off. She sleeps ALL the time. They have 3 beds their size and she claims one of those or sprawls in the middle of Casey's big bed. He doesn't mind. He pretty much ignores her and she doesn't seem to know he exists. She will walk between his legs like he isn't there.   Neither she nor Toto knew what dog food was when they came. I think they were living on fast food. Annie's teeth were rotted out of her head and her little hip bones were showing when she came. I had to teach her to eat things like boned chicken and fried chicken liver. Toto was easier to feed, but he insists on trying to bury it first. If he doesn't bury it - he doesn't like it and I need to find something else. Annie will now eat anything she can gum. They are all on a healthy diet now of grain-free kibble mixed with homecooked chicken.  They are delightful and I adore them. However poor little Widget was still lonely since they didn't play with her. That's when I knew I needed to find another big dog. Casey's story is coming soon. :)"

There is a segment of the population who will ""trade in"" an old dog so they can get a young one. They aren't even apologetic about it. Why would you trade housebroken (well not Annie and Toto) and good manners for the problems of a puppy no matter how adorable they are?  I'd probably be in stitches if he viciously bit me. There is something about a toothless attack that is funny as hell. Toto has mini explosions of anger when he's being groomed. He doesn't bite, but he sounds very fierce. I tell him I'm terrified, give him a minute and then start up again. I think it confuses him that I don't stop, but he's always right there demanding his treat in payment so I guess he doesn't mind all that much."

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3d6c46,pxndx161,8,Tue Jul 14 21:44:42 2015 UTC,I hope some day I'll be able to adopt a senior or two; is it really as expensive as people make it out to be?  Or do people just not love having older pets?
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3d6c46,caramelonion,11,Mon Jul 13 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"From my personal experience, I would say it really depends on the situation. About a decade ago when my family got our first rescue dog, I don't remember him costing very much to adopt. Vet visits weren't very frequent since his only ""problems"" were a few mental scars (which we loved out of him), but what hurt the wallet a bit was when he developed cancer. We tried to have it treated initially, but when it wasn't getting better we forgot about the money and focused on him. He was in pain and one last visit was needed.  So in his case, he was not costly. The only major toll he took was on our hearts as he was a very insecure and mentally abused dog and it hurt to see him go that way. And I guess that's what I'm trying to get at. It's easy to figure out if the pet will end up being expensive if they have medical needs, but what is extremely taxing is having to let go so soon. That can hurt so much I bet it turns a lot of people away from adopting older pets. Even I had trouble coming to terms that my best friend I'd only known for a handful of years was on his way out the door."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3d6c46,caramelonion,6,Mon Jul 13 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"That's good to know; thanks for your response!  I can definitely understand the emotional side, but at the same time I personally feel like it's hard whether you've had them 3 years or 8 years :/  It's sad to see seniors stay on the adoption list for years, especially because a senior can be a great pet for someone who's a bit older, or who might want a lower energy dog"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3d6c46,LauraPtown,2,Tue Jul 14 00:08:44 2015 UTC,Completely agree. Well said.
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3d6c46,Jan_Svankmajer,5,Tue Jul 14 21:43:47 2015 UTC,"Expense depends on the dog. These two were vetted by the shelter who paid for their shots and their dentals. So far their only cost has been a vet checkup and once when Annie mysteriously developed an abscess on a hind foot. I've had others that cost a thousand or more, but if they are going to be expensive you generally know it when you adopt them. And as they age they may get things like diabetes, heart disease and cancer just like elderly people so you have to be prepared to pay for treatment.  But it IS a good excuse not to take them as I've had just as many expensive young dogs."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3d6c46,bigdorkdoglover,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:12:46 2015 UTC,"you could also sign up to be a foster for an older pup (or kitty). If you aren't  in a super great financial position, the foster group will help with vet bills. We have fostered a couple of pets, I lean towards the older guys because I have no patience for puppy shenanigans. We have lost more to them passing away than to adoption, but I'm ok with that. They are in a home where they are loved, they have soft spots to lay on and what ever their heart desires. hurts like hell when they ""leave"" but knowing I made their last bit on this planet enjoyable and comfortable helps tons."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3d6c46,Makarios95,4,Tue Jul 14 07:20:29 2015 UTC,"The organization I foster with specializes in senior dogs, and they do ""fospice"". You take in old dogs that are terminally ill and they spend their last months with you, with the rescue footing all vet bills. I think it is the most magical thing, but I haven't been able to get up the nerve to do a fospice yet. Still haven't really recovered from the death of my senior pup six months ago, not ready to do that again. But when my heart is stronger, I intend to sign up. For now, just healthy seniors, and they are so lovely."

As an animal rescuer, I get a hundred emails a day asking for help with cats and kittens in my area.  I usually focus on kittens and so when I saw his picture I actually deleted the email because I didn't think I could help.  But it just kept bugging me and gnawing at the back of my mind that he must have been in such misery.  So I took the email out of my ""deleted items"" folder and made the arrangements to get the poor guy.    I'm so glad I did!  I took him to the vet, rubbed coconut oil on his sores, and fed him round the clock because he was starving!  Sammy turned out to be one of the nicest kitties in the world and by chance ended up getting adopted by a wonderful family.  I visited him last week and he was happily snoozing in a sunbeam in his favorite spot, like he's lived there forever.    This is why I rescue.  :)"

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3cl77l,Thalnagath,13,Thu Jul 9 00:51:25 2015 UTC,Probably not the best place to pet a dog normally but he was under a railroad car or whatever so it would be difficult to do any sort of normal greeting.

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3cl77l,Chizumaru,5,Thu Jul 9 20:28:17 2015 UTC,I never fail to be moved by how so many of these abandoned or abused animals just want to be loved and to have someone to love in return. The fact that they still trust people is a testament to their essentially loving nature. This was very touching.

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3ch1t3,totalbella,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:49:20 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel. If I had the resources, I absolutely would do the same. I hate that I can't adopt more so I try to be an advocate for abused breeds, especially Pitties, and adopt instead of buying dogs.   The way I see it is this -- ""name brand"" dogs will find homes. People fight to get their hands on them. The ones who need me are the disabled, the mutts, and the at-risk breeds.   But to us, they're not possessions or objects the way a lot of folks see them. To us they're people, and in our case, they're our kids.   My mom yells at me if I even reprimand them at her house, hollering ""You leave my grand babies alone!"" (She gets seriously pissed, no joke). When my oldest was at the vet's for over two weeks because another dog almost killed him, she went with me to visit him any time my husband couldn't due to work, and would bring him all kinds of goodies on top of what I was bringing him. She spoils them rotten.   We even bought her a snowman ornament with a bell that says ""We love our Grandma"" for Christmas and wrapped it with a tag from them. XD She cried, lol.   But my she lives right next door so they're very attached and nothing gets them as excited as the words ""Do you want to go to Grandma's?!""  They really act a lot like any other kid would. Which is why I'm incapable of not bring enraged when I see abandoned and abused animals."

Not all of them wind up deaf, but a pretty significant number do.  I'm not a fan of battle crops or other significant removal of their ear flaps for a lot of reasons, the main one being what you mentioned.  They do look good on some dogs, so I understand why its done, I just don't agree with it.  It looks really good on her, at least in pictures.  If they did a homemade job like I've seen some BYBs do, up close they look like hamburger.  I just wish she didn't have to struggle with those side effects just for cosmetics."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3ch1t3,losernameamirite,2,Wed Jul 8 16:23:15 2015 UTC,The vet said it was definitely a home job. Her ears are too short and lopsided. Unfortunately I don't know anything about her background or why they did it. I'm assuming it was either for cosmetic reasons or for dog fighting. They cut the ears off of them so they don't get ripped off in a fight. We found her in a town where that's very prominent. She also has problems with ear infections because they are so open that a lot of 'stuff' easily gets in there. But I think she has beautiful ears regardless!
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3ch1t3,samuraisal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the infections are the other reason I really don't like to see battle crops.  I had a feeling it was a home job, just by the story.  sigh people suck sometimes, they really do.  The battle crop originally was for exactly what it sounds like, for fighting, to prevent/reduce injury around the ears.  The ears have a lot of blood vessels and nerves, so removing them reduces the chance of a dog bleeding out during a fight.    Its become a lot more cosmetic recently, since a lot of wanna bes just want an aggressive looking dog.  From the look of it and the way you describe Lucy, she's all show!"

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3cd4ro,macosxsealion,16,Tue Jul 7 04:46:19 2015 UTC,"After Dobby had healed from the surgery and before my mom adopted him we took him back to the humane society to be adopted.  Even though he'd been at that shelter before (and others, most likely), that just seemed to be the last straw for Dobby--he started barking incessantly, running in tight neurotic circles, growling, and nipping at people, none which he'd ever done before.  We brought him back to be adopted out of our home, but he still kept a lot of those behaviors, and it was months before he really settled down with my mom.  My mom's been very patient and I think he trusts more now that he's actually at his forever home.  Thankfully, now he's mostly a just a spunky, chill guy.  Dobby also just isn't very good at typical dog stuff.  He rarely plays with toys and didn't know how to play with other dogs very well--he was quite the loner.  But after spending a lot of time with my mom's boyfriend's dogs he's figured out how to relax a bit and how to play with others.  The dog park is his favorite place now and he loves to explore."

His back left leg was completely self amputated, and his front right paw was swollen, necrotic, dangling by a thread so was amputated there. Years of slow amputation as his fur cut through skin, muscle, tendon, bone. He was taken by animal control, and there is a case against the people for inflicting such torturous horrific neglect on him. We fostered him for 2 weeks in February but were about to move out of state. The rescue held onto him for us until he could join us.

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,irishspice,7,Thu Jul 2 06:18:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know what specifically would have caused them to get this way. General lack of dental hygiene (poor diet, nothing to clean them, etc)? A few weeks ago he got very sick and the rescue was thinking he may not make it. Turned out to be a massive abscess in his mouth that got infected, and he lost more teeth. He had all of his teeth on that side pulled, except the lower canine. On his left side he may have one or two in the back. Thankfully he fully recovered, and though we had to delay his flight a couple weeks we're so glad he's with us now!

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,melodicstory,9,Sat Jul 4 12:20:56 2015 UTC,What's the story?
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,irishspice,8,Wed Jul 1 23:34:17 2015 UTC,The world needs more folks like you.
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,irishspice,7,Wed Jul 1 22:08:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for adopting the little sweetie!  Whoever did that to him should be arrested and thrown in jail for ten years -- the same length of time that they abused him.  I'm so happy that he is now with you, living a wonderful life in his forever home!"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,djchair,5,Wed Jul 1 23:19:44 2015 UTC,"Any behavioral problems? What was he like when you first took him home compared to today, personality-wise?"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,ChitterChitterSqueak,10,Thu Jul 2 03:07:23 2015 UTC,"Quick recap, he was rescued by Synergy and she had him for a week. Then we had him for a week. Then back to her for a week, for more vet appointments, then we had him for a 2nd week, then he had to go back to her for a few months during our move out of state. His personality didn't begin to really shine until about 2-3 months in. He started to offer more play behaviors, was more active, wanting to check things out. At first he was really chill but you could tell he was pretty traumatized, overwhelmed, and in pain. Currently he's much more alert, active, curious, and playful the way most dogs are. Behavioral problems are none but some understandable handling issues. He gets bitey when you're trying to groom his feet and face but I started counter-conditioning today a lot and he's responding very well. We take it slow and don't force him, he deserves to be comfortable with handling/grooming and not have it forced upon him (unless medically necessary). I got his back foot mostly clipped today, front foot is the goal for tomorrow."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,IceKreamSupreme,2,Thu Jul 2 04:22:14 2015 UTC,"Everyone involved in this is amazing, especially Bob. I'm stunned he survived this abuse. The rescue must have spent a fortune on him, so he's doubly precious. I rescued a hound who had been so mistreated she screamed if you came near her - not cried - screamed. It didn't take long for her to be accepting and then trusting and then friendly. Bless them, they want so badly to be our friends. Maggie Mae had issues with handling her feet, so many treats. Cut a nail, get a treat. At first she peed with every clip, but then it was okay and then she just expected the treats. Bribery works.  How does this little guy get around? He must have some mobility issues."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,Billitpro,2,Sat Jul 4 12:15:05 2015 UTC,"He actually hops really well! He's not fast, he needs frequent breaks, and wobbles when he's peeing and pooping, he can't go up or down stairs, a 2"" hop up is about his best like up onto a pillow or dog bed. When we're out he is carried pretty much the entire time... oh yes I'm that person now who gets judged for carrying a tiny dog around!"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,doublevisionary,2,Sun Jul 5 22:01:11 2015 UTC,"It's amazing how they adapt. Humans would be pissing and moaning about how hard life is. Dogs just get on with it. And dogs as accessories, well I guarantee this one looks good on you. Let them judge. You know why that little bugger is in your arms -- it's because you are both incredibly lucky. :)"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,onelastswan,3,Mon Jul 6 01:46:45 2015 UTC,Love the name!  Good on you for caring for this little dude.
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bspfy,Camelsloths,3,Thu Jul 2 00:48:08 2015 UTC,Dogs are amazingly resilient and trusting creatures. I see a story like this where an animal has been through something so absolutely horrific but still freely gives his love. It makes my heart ache.

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bq4c1,LolaRockabella,5,Thu Jul 2 02:15:20 2015 UTC,"People don't realize what a huge commitment parrots are. You're not just buying a companion for yourself, you're buying a companion that you will possibly have to will to someone. And they're not just sit and look at me pets. They need as much interaction and stimulation as a dog."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bq4c1,random_user_name_13,5,Wed Jul 1 23:41:07 2015 UTC,My friend is 33. His mom got an African Grey when he was 1. The bird's still kickin and will probably go on for quite a while more. My friend has already told his mom he doesn't want it so his sister has to take it. It's not very nice cause it mostly lives in it's cage. :( it's really sad.

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bq4c1,PeggyOlson225,2,Thu Jul 2 21:36:05 2015 UTC,An African grey is as intelligent as a child. Maybe you could encourage them to find a better home for the bird. If you present some information to show how deprived it is maybe they will let it go to a rescue where it can be better placed. Maybe you could show them videos or articles about Alex the African grey to prove your point. Good luck.

BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bq4c1,vaqari,2,Thu Jul 2 02:12:14 2015 UTC,"This. So much this. I had a cockatiel who lived to be 24 years old. People who buy birds on a whim because they seem like an ""interesting"" pet to have do NOT get how long birds can (and often do) live."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bq4c1,paw_in_action,2,Wed Jul 8 23:10:19 2015 UTC,"Her colors look so much better and beautiful in the last pic! I have little to no knowledge about birds, what type of parrot is she? They live a lot longer than I thought, that's wonderful!   And you mentioned of your other animals, I'd love to see them together if you don't mind ;)"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bq4c1,gophercuresself,8,Wed Jul 1 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"She's some variety of Amazon parrot.  They, along with all of the large parrots, have a lifespan of 50-70 years, although many don't reach this due to poor care."
BeforeNAfterAdoption,3bq4c1,gophercuresself,3,Wed Jul 1 20:27:47 2015 UTC,It's a shame to hear that many of them don't receive proper care. That's a lifetime commitment that some owners seem to take very lightly.   Thank you for the information!
