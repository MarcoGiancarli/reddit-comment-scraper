shitduolingosays,3as3d0,Voidjumper_ZA,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:58:02 2015 UTC,"Really? Standard grammar written in grammar books and dictionaries taught in most places, written in books and used by most of the world doesn't use double negatives. I understand a particular subset of people might be using that patois and it is 'correct' in that area but only so beacause that small area speaks in that fashion. It isn't technically correct English.  And you say it isn't a sign of poor English but there are never great authors, orators, poets or playwrights you use advanced English and sling double negatives. It therefore shows that double negatives are a sign of poor English."
shitduolingosays,3as3d0,Amputee_Fetish,5,Tue Jun 23 22:28:02 2015 UTC,"These standard English and Grammar books and dictionaries are, just that, standard. The rules of these books are also somewhat arbitrary. It's usually a very small group of people who decided's these rules for the entirety of the population.  Also, many of the great writers do write using non standard English. John Steinbeck's Character's spoke in the dialect of their area, and the entirety of The Catcher in The Rye is written like an actual teenager talks."
shitduolingosays,3as3d0,Voidjumper_ZA,0,Tue Jun 23 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"Of course some writers write in it but you'll find that one book will be in it and the rest not. That's because they acknowledge accents and are fleshing out the character in that book with the accent they want him/her/ver to have.   I still stick by the idea that incorrect use of grammar shows poor English. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to make sense to me."
shitduolingosays,3as3d0,Delstein,3,Wed Jun 24 08:30:18 2015 UTC,"Who determines what is incorrect though? That is the problem here. Usage determines what is correct and incorrect. I think that if you can be understood by a fluent, native speaker, then you are using correct English.   Another issue is that English has no regulating body, like French does. French actually has two regulating bodies: one in France (L'Académie française; The French Academy) and one in Canada (Office québécois de la langue française; French Language Board of Quebec). Both have tried to cut down on and even eliminate words from French, especially Anglicisms (loan-words from English). One of the best examples of this is the word for parking: in France, you would say le parking, but in Quebec, the Board of the French Language invented a new word for it: le stationnement.   English has no office like this to regulate the rules of the English language, and the entire premise of your argument is that ""incorrect"" grammar, which is a super-fuzzy line in English, is evidence of ""poor"" language.   Additionally, ""incorrect"" to you is perfectly acceptable to someone else. While you might not use double negatives, they are a common feature of many dialects of English, and native speakers tend to know what they're talking about. You can't just say that Southern US English is poor English because it uses double negatives. Double negatives are acceptable because it's about understanding what someone else is saying. It might irritate some people, but you just have to get over it because, in the end, their message is still getting across.   I'm going to leave you with this relevant comic; even though this isn't about ""literally,"" I still think it applies."

shitduolingosays,3as3d0,binomine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:38:55 2015 UTC,"How one uses language helps identify one's social group.  The use of double negative and quadruple negative for emphasis was a feature of middle English. The Scholastics argued that, for mathematical reasons, that the construction should be eliminated from English and taught everyone to avoid it.   Avoiding the double negative became a maker for being highly educated. Conservative speakers, which tend to be poorer, continued using the double negative. If you use the double negative for emphasis, then it usually marks you as lower class, simply because those speakers kept it in their language. The use of double negatives isn't going nowhere, but they should be avoid, unless you want to slum it a bit.    You can't just say that Southern US English is poor English because it uses double negatives.   While we associate the double negative with the southern dialect, it's usually only the poorer speaker of the southern dialect that uses it. Educated southern speakers also avoid it, for the same reasons that educated northerners avoid it."

Report the ' vs "" as a bug and they'll fix it for us, since neither quote mark is better in situations like this.  If it was an actual quote, such as 'tobisowles once said ""I think this is a bug."".'  Then it would matter."

That's why there's a black quote mark on one side with a red, and a double red quote mark on the other side. The solution is telling you to pick one. Either use single quotes or double quotes. To me it's a typo, not a true error."

shitduolingosays,386fv8,redditor427,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:40:01 2015 UTC,"Off topic: the word for Mother in just about every single European language (with which I'm familiar) starts with an M. Mutter in German,  madre in Spanish,  mère in French, etc.  Why would the creators of Esperanto make the word for mother start with the same letter as the word for father and make the two words so similar?  This seems so counterintuitive for a language that is supposed to facilitate conversation."
shitduolingosays,386fv8,king_zog,9,Tue Jun 2 05:42:23 2015 UTC,It's because the ending -in indicates that a word is feminine:  patro - father  patrino - mother  knabo - boy  knabino - girl  avo - grandfather  avino - grandmother  It makes it way easier to remember words.
shitduolingosays,386fv8,benjaib,2,Tue Jun 2 11:12:52 2015 UTC,-ino is the feminine suffix.
