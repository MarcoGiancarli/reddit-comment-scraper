That area of Hwy 6 is four lanes with a large median and a 65mph speed limit.  It'd be pretty hard for someone to know he would be there at that time in someone else vehicle.

I'll give it to you that the flag is overall aesthetically pleasing in balance.  However the clusterfuck of stars in the middle is a bit much.  Don't we want kids of various levels of artistic talent to be able to draw this?  I would think so.  I didn't want this to come out so blunt and harsh, but if I'm going to be looking at the dam thing every where I just hope it's not going to be an eyesore. Plus, noone else made a comment yet, and comments like this tend to spark discussion."
mississippi,3d5unv,Grutzai,8,Mon Jul 13 22:05:01 2015 UTC,Isn't the American Flag the biggest clusteruck of stars? That was pretty easy for me to draw as a kids in 1st grade after immigrating from canada where all we had to draw was a big leaf. You're not giving kids enough credit.
mississippi,3d5unv,Sylxian,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:27:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that there is a shit load of stars in a small, single space on the American flag.  However, them being in neatly, staggered rows makes it less of a clusterfuck because the stars make a diamond shaped grid.  The proposed clusterfuck is a mathematical vomit of inconsistency where the stars are concerned.  Off the top of my head, the single best improvement would be to get rid of the 13 starred outer ring, and at a point to the middle star.  That would make it a hell of a lot more symmetrical - hell, why not make them all six-point stars; that's a rarity in the flag world."

Picture the removal of any set of stars, and you will only have that one vertical line of symmetry. Even with no stars, that's what you get. So that's pretty fucking geometrically consistent if you ask me.  If you don't like the flag, say so. There's really no need to be a keyboard warrior and shit on this work. Try some more objective (and correct) criticism next time. Even people wanting to keep the Confederate Battle Flag waving are saying so with more tact than you."
mississippi,3d5unv,Sylxian,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:31:51 2015 UTC,"I believe my words very much have - albeit indirectly - implied that I don't care for this flag design.  Furthermore, saying things bluntly is a type of tact.  Not run of the mill, I know, but still just as effective and usually more efficient.  Tough-love trumps sugar-coating in my book.  If a person puts something on the internet - even me.  That person is opening themselves up to all manner of criticism, and it's all on how a person takes is what makes it positive or negative.  On the symmetry.  I'd like to point out there there are indeed two lines of symmetry with my said improvement.  It hinges on how many points of the remaining stars have.  But I can tell you are hung up on the colours of the red and blue bars as to why it is not symmetrical.  Ask any art person and I'm sure they will tell you that regardless of colour choice, the design would be balanced and symmetrical on two axis."

It's about what happened in the 20th century and what is happening in the 21st. Whatever the flag might have been or whatever it might have meant 150 years ago is irrelevant. It is now a symbol of hatred that is used by groups of domestic terrorists and it has no business being officially connected to any state government.  Someone else mentioned the swastika, which I think is an apt comparison. As I think we all know, the swastika was used in the past by different groups including Buddhists, Hindus, and Native Americans. But you can't just go around waiving a flag with the swastika on it and say, ""no, no; it's ok, I'm a Buddhist!"" Whatever it used to mean, it doesn't mean that anymore."
mississippi,3cg4d4,northlamar,13,Tue Jul 7 22:14:10 2015 UTC,"In the same sense that the swastika wasn't made by the Nazi's but adopted by them, what's now called the Confederate flag has become the symbol of the confederacy and all the bad things associated with them."
mississippi,3cg4d4,FailDeadly,13,Tue Jul 7 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"The flag does not represent the Confederacy, it represents the American South: the hardships, the days of cotton, the magnolia flower, and a group of people who always support each other.   I mean this quite respectfully: nobody gives a fuck. The flag was allowed to become a symbol of racism and hate. Nobody stood up to defend the flag against this transformation. It's a century too late to cry over this spilt milk. Move on."

mississippi,3cg4d4,achancesw,2,Thu Jul 9 13:42:39 2015 UTC,The Confederate flag as portrayed on the MS flag was at least used by parts of the Confederacy during the Civil War as a battle flag. It has since been used constantly as a symbol of intimidation and terrorism toward African-Americans. It needs to go.

I believe most people that do visit the sub are pretty well informed already due to so many of the other subs being down.  Leave us open for discussing issues that still apply to our state.  A banner informing people of the reason for the blackouts on reddit will do very well to show our support to our subreddit.   That's just my opinion though.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

mississippi,3b7qnx,bmoc,11,Fri Jun 26 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"THE Supreme court legalizes it. Our AG, Jim Hood, thinks an appeals court stay in Louisiana has any bearing after this supreme court ruling.  http://www.wcbi.com/local-news/ag-jim-hood-says-same-sex-marriages-cannot-start-immediately/  He may VERY well make Mississippi the last state to legalize it. After the nonsense with Microsoft paying him to go after Google and now this shit I really wish he would be removed from any and all functions of our state."
mississippi,3b7qnx,neerk,0,Fri Jun 26 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"I saw this elsewhere and from what has been said in Louisiana today it looks like its true:  there is a 25 day waiting period for this to officially take effect because of a SCOTUS rule where the losing side has a 25 day window to make an appeal.  An appeal has almost never been granted which is why some states ( Texas , Kentucky, ect.) aren't even trying to be assholes about it, it is effectively the law of the land but if a state wants to make sure its all good and wait for that period than they have that right.  Edit: NM about Texas, shockingly Rick Perry Greg Abbot is being an asshole"

If Mississippi changes its flag under these circumstances, it will just be the result of a few news cycles about a dipshit with a gun in a different state.   I'm not particularly attached to the current flag. I just see all this (not your flag, but the wave of crazy witnessed lately) as a bunch of reactionary pandering to people who don't have knowledge of or interest in our actual life down here.  That said, I don't find your flag particularly objectionable."
mississippi,3b41ds,GnosticMoron,3,Thu Jun 25 20:56:06 2015 UTC,"I actually heard yesterday an interview on the radio with a lot of young African Americans on the streets of New York (where I live).

IT SHOULD BE UNNECESSARY TO ADD THIS, BUT NO ONE SHOULD REPLY TO THIS AS THOUGH I'M MAKING THIS ARGUMENT ... I'M SAYING ""I HEARD THIS ON THE RADIO."""
mississippi,3b41ds,memyselfandeye,4,Fri Jun 26 13:55:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comments! :)  I definitely see both sides of the issue. While a new flag isn't going to change anything I believe it's necessary for reasons in addition to the SC/nationwide statements.  The rebirth and growth themes of the flag would be a statement that the state sees that it needs to do better in regards to health, safety, education, and social issues of all kinds. This would be a HUGE leap, but that's the MS that I would love to have. The people here have it in them to do all those things, but we drag our feet because it's what our fathers and grandfathers did before us. I don't want to tear off the rearview mirror, I just want to make the windshield bigger."

Even aside from the racist stuff associated with the Confederate battle flag, it still represents a failed insurrection against the USA. It doesn't make much sense IMHO to have that as part of our flag or for SC to fly it at their capitol building since, you know, we're part of the USA."

No one is trying to smother free speech or say that you can't have a Confederate flag at/in  your home. But having it on our official state flag or South Carolina flying a Confederate battle flag at the state capitol is entirely different. That is the state government publicly endorsing the symbol.    Also, the Confederate battle flag has been used for other purposes and to support other causes since the end of the Civil War. It was used prominently by the Dixiecrats in the 1940s onward largely as a symbol of pro-segregation. Ole Miss didn't start using the flag until AFTER the Dixiecrats became associated with it. Finally, the governor of Alabama raised the flag over their state capitol in 1963 explicitly as a protest to desegregation. It's about way more than the Civil War."

mississippi,3awnvv,aje1,3,Wed Jun 24 15:47:21 2015 UTC,"Mississippi adopted it because they wish the invasion and subsequent occupation went differently. They wish they had won. But it isn't a fuck you to blacks or slaves or anything like that. It is a remembrance of a better time.     37% of people that live in Mississippi today would have been slaves or sub-citizens in that ""better time."" The Black Codes were passed immediately after the Civil War. In 1860, there were 1.2 slaves for every white person in Mississippi. ""Free coloreds"" represented just 0.001% of the state's population.    How is it not a fuck you to black people to call a time when they had zero rights a ""better time""?"
mississippi,3awnvv,askantik,3,Wed Jun 24 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"My point is that the MAJORITY of humans in the state were slaves at that time.     Perhaps a time were everyone's grandfather, father, husband, brother, and son hadn't been exterminated by the Yankees was better?     I have lived in Mississippi my entire life. But guess what-- when you secede from your country and then attack your country first (which the CSA did at Fort Sumter), heavy casualties is very real risk that you take. It's not like the Union committed unprovoked genocide.     If someone says that the turn of the century was an amazing time they are not necessarily saying that the time when women couldn't vote is the best time. Perhaps they are referring to other aspects.     Ok..."

mississippi,3awnvv,TigerVert,2,Wed Jun 24 17:17:04 2015 UTC,You make it sound like the KKK made the confederate flag a hate symbol. The flag was the symbol of subjecting blacks during the civil war. I think that automatically makes it a symbol of hate.
mississippi,3awnvv,jcchurch,3,Thu Jun 25 12:18:08 2015 UTC,"You must be new. Welcome to the Internet. We will gladly pick our own interpretation.  One of those things representing this flag was obviously ""subjugating blacks"". It's as if you are saying that you love ""cotton, southern living, antebellum homes, and subjugating blacks"". I think I can show my appreciation for cotton in a manner that doesn't also condone racism."

mississippi,3asw6n,hells_cowbells,3,Tue Jun 23 06:44:34 2015 UTC,"No, they won't ask about registration. As long as you are legally allowed to own a gun , which is basically don't be a felon and be over the legal age, you should be good. I would suggest looking up the laws about having guns in your vehicle, though. If you plan on having it in the vehicle, you may want to consider getting a concealed carry permit. They aren't that expensive, and give more options for transporting it. Also, I would highly recommend taking pictures of the gun and recording the serial number, in case it gets stolen."

Maybe that's wrong of me, because maybe it's not your fault, maybe your racist dad or your racist grampa just engrained it into your personality.. but we live in a world now that all it takes is one iota of intelligence to know that, regardless of culture or personality, all people are equal and deserve to be equal and we're all the same on the inside - and you made a decision to let that one iota of intelligence be replaced with ignorance, whether it be the way you were taught or the way you actually think, despite all rational evidence telling you that it's false. You choose to be ignorant, one way or another; and that's okay, that's your choice. But you make an entire region of the country look like ignorant, racist, assholes when you make that choice, and you know that.   And that's why I dislike people like you. Because you actively choose to be ignorant in a day and age where it's unacceptable, particularly in Ameria, and by making that decision you make us all look bad, which you realize, but are just too self centered to care about.  TL;DR I (come painfully close to the emotion that most people label as) HATE PEOPLE LIKE YOU."

mississippi,39rkwn,Huntsmitch,2,Sun Jun 14 07:02:27 2015 UTC,I went to boarding school in Port Gibson at the now closed Chamberlain Hunt. It is a beautiful place. I would recommend camping on one of the campgrounds on the Natchez Trace near PG. Eating at the Country Store in nearby Lorman is a MUST. The fried chicken is the best in the state and worth the trip alone. When I was there the owner who was a very sweet black man would come out in the dining room and sing to the guests. Awesome place.

Wake up and immediately go eat Big Bad Breakfast.  If you don't eat there, something is seriously wrong with you.... I speak the truth, and only the truth; so seriously, go.  Follow that with a trip to High Point coffee to pick up whatever your soon to be over caffeinated heart desires.  As you sip your coffee, walk around the Square poking your head in and out of the shops and boutiques (be sure to stop by Neilson's, one of the few remaining old school department stores in the state) After your walk around the Square, take a much deserved rest in Square Books.  Grab a book (or your computer to play on reddit) and relax a bit, because the rest of the day is going to be full of more walking.  After your break is complete, hop on over to Ajax Diner and get you a good ole fashioned Blue Plate lunch.  Carbo load, if you will, for the next trek of the day.  After you have successfully contributed to the obesity problem that is the state of MS (I'm from here, so I can say that sort of thing), head over to campus and just get lost on campus.  TSUN's, I mean Ole Miss' campus is as pretty as any of them, with the exception of MS State of course.  Enjoy your walk and talk with the students, the professors, or whomever you come across really.  After you have successfully sweated yourself down, head back to wherever you are staying to get cleaned up for the night.  Prior to dinner, head out and up to the bar at Bourè.  Grab you a pre-meal cocktail or 3, after all you are probably dehydrated from your walking journey through campus.  From there, march your happy and slightly tipsy self over to McEwen's and enjoy a nice meal, get you some wine if you feel so inclined.  After you have treated yourself to a kings feast, head over and back up to the bar at City Grocery.  Hopefully some live music will be playing, so you can sit back and enjoy the show while sipping on some liquid libations.  After your weekend is complete, head back to the PineBelt and keep that memory of Oxford, MS forever.  THENNNNNNN next year, go to Starkville and post again, and I'll give you my recommendations for my college town... After all, it's the superior of the two.  ;-)  Enjoy your time and as always, HAIL STATE!"

Definitely hit up the bars if that's your scene but don't forget about the beer laws there. If they haven't changed in the past two years, the bars should close at 1 a.m. on Thursday and Friday, and midnight on Saturday. You can't buy cold beer or singles from gas stations or stores. If you want some outdoor fun, head out to Sardis Lake and go for a swim.   And to add, don't be surprised by the lack of people. This time of year, after school is out, there's nobody around. The bars will be fairly sparse but getting around will be a dream. It's a nightmare during school."

Super cheap and super delicious, but it's not a fancy place at all. Big Bad Breakfast is definitely overrated..except their bacon.   Check out The Local Voice's Daily Dispatch for specials for other food and bars. You wont get bad food in Oxford. Volta's gyro and margarita are my personal favorites.   There are also several great antique stores that have everything from old comic books to furniture--The Mustard Seed, The Depot, Sugar Magnolia. There's also one in Taylor, MS (about 20 min drive) that is next to one of the more famous restaurants in Northern MS, Taylor Grocery. It's a beautiful drive.   Walk around the square and explore then get to a balcony and people watch to your heart's content. You'll see some characters. There's not a whole lot to do that doesn't revolve around drinking. Have a happy Thirsty Thursday!"

As you're coming from Al, you'll come through Fulton, then Tupelo. Tupelo is the birthplace of Elvis. If you take the 'Elvis Presley Blvd' you can go down and see the house he was born and raised in.  Farther down 78 you'll see the exit for the Natchez Trace Parkway. If you take that exit and take a right there will be a Native American village area there on the left.  The Natchez Trace Parkway is a nice road trip road, if you enjoy road trips. It runs from Jackson MS to Nashville, Tn.    Also, if you go to Main St from Elvis Birthplace, you can drive down Main street Tupelo. Not much to see, but it was the first TVA city.  There are a few civil war areas in and around Tupelo as well. I'm not sure of your interests.   If you're looking for off the wall kind of stuff I'll have to think about it.  The areas you'll be going through, if you're taking 78 to Memphis are as follows: Itawamba County (Fulton), Lee County (Tupelo), Pontotoc, Union County(New Albany), Marshall County (Holly Springs), Olive Branch, Memphis Tn...."

mississippi,38rfmo,rotll,3,Sat Jun 6 12:48:38 2015 UTC,"It used to stop in Jackson, back around the turn of the millennium if I recall correctly. But then they cut a deal with the Dinsmore neighborhood and were able to finish it.  And by stop I mean you'd have to get on the interstate to Clinton then you could get back on it."

mississippi,38rfmo,Johnsu,4,Sat Jun 6 11:25:32 2015 UTC,New Albany is where I usually get gas. It's often cheaper than Tupelo. There's a pilot store at the first exit with an Arbys. William Faulkner was born in New Albany. Nothing really to see that I know of but if you go past that pilot toward Pontotoc for about a mile you'll see an oddly shaped building that I think is catholic church shaped like a scorpion. You can also view it on Google Earth so...yeah.    Side note regarding Pontotoc: Pontotoc was where the landmark case about prayer in school originated in the 90s.

If you take the fulton exit and take a left toward Amory, MS and go a few miles you'll see on your left Itawamba Agricultural Higeh school. The ACLU settled a case for LGBT rights regarding this school.  If you bypass the fulton exit, you will still cross over the Tennessee-Tombigbee River. So there's that, I guess."
mississippi,38rfmo,neotheism,3,Sat Jun 6 05:08:03 2015 UTC,"Tupelo is next but I covered it somewhat. The Pontotoc area you'll see is the Sherman and Blue Springs area. Not much there other than the new Toyota factory. There is a Catfish place in sherman just off the exit, that is open on weekeends but I haven't tried it yet. There's a truck stop at that exit that has good chicken gizzards. Gas is decent price here but I usually get mine in New Albany when going up to Memphis."
mississippi,38rfmo,neotheism,3,Sat Jun 6 05:14:32 2015 UTC,Along 78 I believe before you get to Olive Branch there will be an exit for Ingram ' s Mill.....this sign is where the band 'Ingram Hill' got their name... one of them thought it said Ingram Hill..

mississippi,37r8gs,up_o,4,Fri May 29 19:17:05 2015 UTC,"Culture shock will probably be intense. I grew up in the suburbs of Memphis 2 hours away from the delta and moving here felt like moving to a different world. The poverty is mind blowing. Most small towns, Webb included, have main streets that look like ghost towns. Sadly, the crime rate has been steadily going up in the delta, even in small towns. Be prepared for the racism. Not like KKK rallies but like white people live on one side of the railroad tracks, black people on the other.   Cleveland or Clarksdale would be the best bet for living/working. Cleveland has its issues, but is a pretty nice small town. If you are willing to drive to batesville, Oxford is just 15 more minutes away and it is probably one of the best cities in Mississippi.   On the bright side, people in the delta tend to be very friendly. The older people especially love to strike up conversations with anyone, anywhere. As far as things to do, Cleveland has Hey Joe's which is a pretty fun restaurant/bar for the younger crowd. The BB King museum in Indianola is amazing and so is the Blue Biscuit bar next door. Cleveland is getting a new Grammy Museuem soon. ground zero blues club in Clarksdale is fun. The Po Monkey juke joint is one of the last true juke joints still in operation. It is kind of a must see in the delta. I haven't seen it, but Anthony Bourdain did a CNN special on the delta that might have some good places to check out. There is a cypress forest national park south of Greenville that is beautiful. Abe's BBQ in clarksdale is very good. Lost pizza in Cleveland/Indianola is good and they have a large beer (bottled) selection. Delta Meat Market in Cleveland has great lunches and a Friday/Saturday happy hour with music. The juke joint festival in clarksdale is April every year. Indianola has a bb king homecoming festival during the summer (I think they intend to keep it going). Cleveland has an art festival in the spring and ocktoberfest in the fall. These are just the first few things to pop into my head."

Indianola, BB King's final resting spot, as well as his museum.  Grenada, Enid, and Sardis lakes, flood control for the delta (where you are moving to), and great places for boating, swimming, fishing, etc.  Nightlife?

I'm actually visiting with a few people from my church as part of a kind of exchange with another church in MS. I imagine that sounds a bit weird, but the purpose is really just to experience the local culture, help out with stuff in the church and see some of the sights of Mississippi. I think we're venturing into New Orleans one day."

mississippi,36jllw,dragonads,10,Thu May 28 13:00:14 2015 UTC,"August is pretty much the thick of it, I'm afraid. Expect high humidity and highs in the 90s Fahrenheit, for sure. In my anecdotal experience, high humidity means your body isn't getting much relief from sweating, because it just sticks to you rather than reducing heat by evaporating. Prepare to use sunscreen and wear light clothes if you are going to be outside. Drink water, of course. But what I really recommend is always being near air conditioning.  As regards spiders, swimming pools that are very unkempt is the only real danger one might expect, because of black widow spiders hiding around pool equipment, and even that is a fairly low risk (black widows are smaller than a thumb, black with red under abdomen). Unless you are deep in the woods, you aren't likely to see big spiders, and even so, big spiders around here aren't especially dangerous. Generally, spiders just aren't a big risk in MS.  Enjoy."

mississippi,367a2y,z6joker9,5,Sat May 16 22:12:46 2015 UTC,A lot of people forget about the cost of living when they bring up negative things about MS. MS has the lowest cost of living of any state. According to CNN making $30k in Jackson is the equivalent of making $76.5k in New York City.
mississippi,367a2y,snugglebuttt,5,Sun May 17 11:18:10 2015 UTC,"I moved here about 10 years ago, made lots of friends and got married to someone who has family here.

Even if I did move for career purposes, I think I'd still retire here.  Just feels like home.  I still haven't decided if I will stay permanently though.  My wife complains of there not being much to do (Central MS).  Overall, something better would have to come along and present itself I think.  If i went somewhere and really liked it, I would stay.

Most of the time I've enjoyed it, even if I know I would never move there.   I kinda feel like the other user who mentioned improving things. If I found a great place that had what I wanted/needed, I'd probably move ASAP. But while I'm here, it would be nice to make Mississippi more progressive instead of collapsing backwards.   I'm not on a political rant, I am just talking about infrastructure and education. The thing I like most about traveling to a newer city is that you can just go places without needing a car. Even in nicer areas like Madison, you can't go from one business to another without a car—unless it's part of a strip mall.  Why do our cities hate sidewalks and multi—use paths?"

It doesn't mean that you're disloyal to where you're from - I love my home state - but it means that you're ready to explore the world. There's a lot out there. Moving around, meeting new people, and creating new networks is tough, but it forces you to grow as a person. And it's worth it in the long run.  If you don't like it, you can always come back to Mississippi. I'll keep your seat warm. :)"

If you have the cash go ahead and leave, it's not that hard or expensive to move and start over if you don't have kids or any real obligations. Leaving is not a bad thing, I had a similar outlook back then, but I found over the years that Mississippi is not that bad of a place, despite what the media says. I made way more money elsewhere, but my cost of living is stupid high compared to MS. It's really a ""same shit, different place"" everywhere we've lived, but if you got the itch a change of scenery can be a good thing, and you never know you might find a place that you really enjoy."

I grew up in Clinton, and when I graduated high school, I wanted nothing more than to leave. I had never travelled, and I knew I could make more money/have more ""stuff"" to do in a different place. I had a full ride to MS State, so I put off leaving until graduating in 2013. Then I immediately moved to Houston and got a job making more money than I knew what to do with. But I was miserable. I couldn't make friends. I sat in traffic for an hour each day. I was constantly doing conference calls and sending email in the evening. The city was dirty, and I had to drive 30 minutes just to have a view unobstructed by office buildings. The list goes on. I changed jobs and moved back soon as I responsibly could, but I wouldn't change the way I did things. I know myself better and have a clearer view of what I want out of life. I'm not discouraging you from moving away. I think if you responsibly can, you should take these opportunities while you have the chance. You may find yourself a lot happier somewhere else, but you won't know until you experience it.

mississippi,34qh5p,veryfunbags,2,Mon May 4 01:11:23 2015 UTC,"Can't get much safer than Ridgeland. Madison has no apartments but you may be able to find a rental home but you're going to pay for it.

That's why I like my small place in Madison and put up with it is because it's safe and close to Kroger, Wal-Greens, and The Trace.  You're definitely not being rude to Jackson I promise. We all know how it is which is why so many people on here mention Clinton, Madison, Ridgeland, Byram...  I have a unique situation with my dogs.

mississippi,34bqsv,Hattiesburg,4,Wed Apr 29 21:49:30 2015 UTC,I feel like the chief of police was the only person in the room who wasn't an ass.
mississippi,34bqsv,cbvenom,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:43:27 2015 UTC,"Though, I don't blame the DA for defending his office when the mayor is publicly attacking it. I mean one of the guys hasn't even qualified for habitual offender status yet, and two other guys had convictions in other jurisdictions. A lot goes in to plea bargains, and without personally discussing these matters with the DA, the mayor could not have known the details of the cases and quality of work the DA was actually doing. Thus, to me this was a blind attack for political gain by the Mayor, and if this is indicative of the Mayor's quality of work, I hope it backfires on him."
mississippi,34bqsv,Llamalawyer,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:14:01 2015 UTC,"Oh it definitely was for political gain. That's why he was an ass in my opinion. But, in his defense, he does deserve to be worried about crime in his city. Also, I do agree with your comment about tge DA as well. There is a lot that factors in. However, I also feel the DA shouldn't have downplayed the actions of those individuals. Not that these guys are murderers yet, but seriously, to be charged with that many crimes in and around Clinton, Jackson, Ridgeland, and Madison and still not be behind bars somewhere is a tad messed up.   But to me, the chief was the only one who wasn't trying to throw someone under the bus or choose any side. He's just trying to do his job and he looked like he genuinely cares about the public."
mississippi,348vax,TerryYockey,2,Wed Apr 29 05:39:23 2015 UTC,Looks like First Presbyterian Church of Meridian.
mississippi,348vax,OUTIEBELLYBUTTON_FAN,1 point,Wed Apr 29 07:23:45 2015 UTC,"First Presbyterian Church of Meridian:       First Presbyterian Church of Meridian is a historic church in Meridian, Mississippi, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  The church was founded in 1856 by eight members including John T. Ball and Lewis A. Ragsdale, founders of the city of Meridian. The reverend at the time was William Curtis Emerson.   From 1856 to 1867, the church met in the second floor of a store owned by one of the members. In 1867, the church had grown enough to construct a building on the corner of 25th Avenue and 7th Street in which to hold its services. After a fire on January 27, 1883, the building was destroyed; members of the church later rebuilt the structure using brick instead of wood. The church remained at its location on 25th Avenue and 7th Street until September 25, 1911, when it was sold to the city of Meridian. The city currently uses the building to house the Meridian Museum of Art.   After selling the old building, the church bought a lot at the corner of 23rd Avenue and 10th Street. The building, designed by architect Penn Jeffries Krouse, was built in 1913 and dedicated on March 29, 1914. In 1951, an educational building addition used for Sunday School was completed under the leadership of pastor Dr. J. Kelly Unger.     Image i     Interesting: Meridian Museum of Art | P.J.

I called MaxxSouth today and they are $66.99 for 50 MBPS for the first 6 months, $76.99 after that.  I'm not sure how reliable their service is or how accurate their speeds are, but it'd be tough to convince me they're worse than AT&T."

mississippi,34634a,putinnitup,9,Tue Apr 28 16:24:35 2015 UTC,"I live just down the road in Panola County.  Where are you coming from, and will you have any personal transportation available to you?  We have NO mass transit to speak of, so if you want to see the sights, you're going to need access to a car or motorcycle to get out of Oxford and check things out.    That said, Memphis has been mentioned.  Go with friends, locals who know the place, and you'll be fine, and enjoy yourself.  Tupelo is to the east.  I'm close to Batesville, on Sardis Lake, and it's a mellow place to hang out, fish, swim, camp, etc.  Clarksdale is further west on HWY 6, and is the home of the blues and the Crossroads, if you are familiar with the Robert Johnson mythology.  Further out, and worth visiting since you'll be here for a few years, are Vicksburg, Natchez, New Orleans, Hattiesburg, and the gulf coast, including biloxi, Gulport, Mobile Alabama, and Destin FL.  Those would all be overnight trips, but ceratinly worth considering."
mississippi,34634a,rotll,15,Tue Apr 28 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"The average temperature during the winter is going to be 30-50 degrees Farenheit normally.  You have extremes that go down in the 20s and rarely into the 10s.  More often than that it will get rather ""warm"" in the winter, going as high as 70 or 80 during the day.  The summer will have lows in the mid 80s and highs in the 110s.  The real issue with MS is the humidity.  In the winter the cold is wet and can chill you easily.  In the summer, the heat is thick with moisture and will choke the will to live out of you.    Meeting people at Ole Miss is fairly easy.  Talk to people in your classes, check the bulletin boards for clubs/intramural groups.  If you live in a dorm, introduce yourself to your neighbors.  People are very open to meeting others.  As a life long Mississippian, there's not a lot to see that's really major.  Memphis is an hour away and there's plenty to do there, but it's also Memphis so most people don't like going there.  Don't have much to say on this one though."
mississippi,34634a,sydien,9,Tue Apr 28 17:05:36 2015 UTC,"In the peak of winter, I'd say highs are typically in the 30s to 50s.  Things to do depends on your interests. If you have a boat or kayak or something, Lake Sardis is great. If you enjoy nightlife, there's no shortage of it on the Square. You can volunteer at the local animal shelter (Oxford-Lafayette Humane Society). Shopping is good in both Tupelo and Memphis. The Tanglefoot Trail around Pontotoc is great for biking. The Thacker Trails here in Oxford are great for walking or mountain biking. There are some great mountain bike trails around Sardis."

If you ever get into a questionable area, you're only a few blocks to get out of it.   But don't be scared to go there. It's a great place with awesome food, museums, food, a zoo, food, music, and did I mention food? Grab some BBQ while you're there."
mississippi,34634a,jamille4,5,Wed Apr 29 13:14:23 2015 UTC,"Hi! Ole Miss is a very friendly campus. There are a lot of ways to get involved and meet people. There is a student organization for almost anything you can think of: international students, major-specific, community service, politics, general interest. You'll probably get a list during your orientation. You can probably find a list somewhere on their website too.  Ole Miss is located in Oxford, which is a very small town. During free time, students go to sporting events. American football, baseball, and basketball are the biggest sports on campus. During football season, everyone dresses up for games (dresses, slacks, etc) and tailgates (set up tents and eat and drink) in what we call the Grove (a large green space in the middle of campus). Even if you don't attend a game, it's fun to spend all day hanging out there.   Oxford is also home to famous author William Faulkner.  A lot of people enjoy touring his house. Students usually hang out on the Square, Oxford's downtown area. It has a lot of bars and great restaurants.   Outside of Oxford, you can definitely visit Memphis. It's home to a lot of cool things, depending on your interests. You can visit Elvis's home here, the zoo, a baseball game, recording studios, and eat barbecue. A lot of international students will take vacations together during school breaks to visit locations farther away. A few to consider are Nashville, TN; New Orleans, LA; the Gulf Coast. I suggest trying to think of things you want to see while you're here. Chances are some other students will want to see the same things, and you can road trip together."

mississippi,34634a,LordWoodenBottom,3,Tue Apr 28 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"I've been going to Ole Miss for a few years now. I have many international student friends from around the world and there is a very welcoming program for international students here. You will have a special orientation and the program likes to host events with other international students and American students. They have picnics every semester and sometimes they have bus trips to Memphis, transportation is paid already. Many students who are from a specific country are area will become involved in the student organization that connects the international students with students who are majoring in the language of your area (Omani students, Korean students, etc.) and it's a great way to meet new people and connect with people from your own country.   Besides this, there is always plenty of nightlife if you want to party. The university lies in the city of Oxford, and our central ""social destination"" is called the Square. There are more than a few bars and local music performances going on every week. There are many parties, both at the fraternity and sorority houses and off-campus. I don't now where you will be staying, but many international students who live off-campus stay at an apartment complex called The Trails. There are lots of parties there every weekend.  When you come here, you will most likely fly into the Memphis airport in Tennessee, and the university will arrange for you to be picked up and brought to Oxford in Mississippi. The ride is about an hour and a half. I think everyone else has basically covered tourism in the area, so I'll leave it at that.  The temperature here varies. In the winter (late October to February) it is normally from the 20's Fahrenheit to the 50's, and in the summer (late May to September) it can get very hot and humid, from the 80's to the 100's. The temperature can really vary according to time of day -- sometimes in the winter when I wake up at 7am it's barely over 10 Fahrenheit, and in the afternoon it can get to almost 60, and there can also be storms or heat waves that affect the temperature significantly. It snows or ices over only a couple times a year, but it rains very, very often. Be prepared for anything."

mississippi,345k9g,Ennaz,7,Tue Apr 28 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"If you come through the top of Mississippi, you should see Elvis's birthplace. Civil war battlefields are neat to see (we don't have any war more recent on our soil)- check their schedules for the time you're here and see if there is a reenactment going on. Those are strange but you should see one.  Lots of food here, through any part you drive. Figure out your route and we'll tell you where and what to eat.  The natchez trace is a non-commercial road with lots of trees, low speed, and landmarks along the way. It runs from Nashville to New Orleans (both desirable cities to visit). It also goes through Tupelo (aforementioned Elvis's birthplace), Jackson (state capitol) and Natchez (lots of beautiful plantation homes). I would recommend."

mississippi,345k9g,z6joker9,3,Wed Apr 29 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"I definitely second this! Oxford has some of the best collection of restaurants in North Mississippi so definitely swing by. Besides BBB we have everything from comfort food places like Ajax and Gus's (fried chicken) to upscale places like City Grocery and Snackbar (seafood). Most of these places are located on or around ""The Square"", a historic shopping and dining area around the city's courthouse. They have a wonderful, eccentric used book store and the buildings are quite impressive. The University of Mississippi is considered one of the nation's most beautiful. If you're interested in American literature, you can visit the home of William Faulkner (now a museum) and while you're there, you can take a short but beautiful hike in Bailey's Woods next door. You can definitely get a full day's worth of unique activities out of Oxford."

mississippi,33cm7q,pilotmkn,9,Fri Apr 24 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"In its most recent petition, the task force noted that Oxford “is experiencing a marked increase in arrests” and listed a detailed breakdown of drug arrests: nearly half of the unit’s 228 drug arrests in 2014 were for marijuana, and around half of those arrested on a drug charge were first-time offenders.  In the competition for a share of the funding, “you have to show that you have a real problem,” said Michael Levine, a former DEA agent who has written two books about his cases. “To show that you have a real problem, there’s only one way, and that’s to show the number of arrests that you’re making.”  “It’s clear local law enforcement agencies have identified the goose that lays the golden egg,”  If you ask me it seems like they are inflating their arrest numbers by taking down kids like Andy (purchasing 12.3 grams over 3 trips, clearly for personal consumption) so they can get the goose to keep laying golden eggs.  I mean 25% of their arrest in a year are from first time marijuana offenders?  Sounds like a bunch of fluff.  Funny to think just right down the road we have the University growing the stuff."

Starting your sophomore year start reaching out to professors and people of power within the community that you want to learn outside of class. Showing motivation to learn outside of the university will go far here.  I could write a huge paper on my opinions on the university but I will say that it is a great university if you manage to be all you can be.

mississippi,300atb,achancesw,4,Mon Mar 23 13:11:46 2015 UTC,PhD in Ed here. To get a license in education in MS you have to complete a educator licensure program. (You have to have more than a BA unless that BA is in Ed). There are several alternate route programs that can be done in little time. They tend to give you a 1-year temporary license while you teach your first year and then award the 5-year license after a successful 1st year (glowing recommendation from principal required). There is another option... There are several masters in teaching programs (12 month at olemiss) where you get a masters degree and licensure at the same time.  This is the place to start. The praxis exams are pretty easy compared to this hurdle. What subject/grade are you thinking of?
mississippi,300atb,carldewitt,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:31:19 2015 UTC,"Here's the 2014-15 MAEP Salary Schedule.  You have to love to teach to get that level of education, and work for so little money."
mississippi,300atb,rotll,3,Mon Mar 23 14:40:56 2015 UTC,"There are several programs like the NOYCE scholarship ($20,000 a year) that will pay for people to get a license science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). So the financial obstacles are not always as bad as you might think. We have an over-abundance of history and English teachers and a shortage of STEM teachers. Unfortunately, we are all on the same pay scale regardless of what subject is taught (there is always a little negotiating that can take place if they need you though) It does pay incredibly low for someone who has a BA or above. I wish I could say that teachers are paid as professionals but that just is not the case at most schools. Some districts with a good tax base add a nice chunk to that base salary to boost your pay to an extra $10k to the salary schedule."

mississippi,300atb,deafy_duck,2,Mon Mar 23 15:48:45 2015 UTC,I think the best thing to do is to call your closest university and speak to an advisor in the education department. They'll be able to outline everything you need better than I can.
mississippi,300atb,smeargle777,2,Mon Mar 23 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"Been teaching in MS public schools for eight years now. You will be tough to find a school where you would solely teach ""broadcast journalism"", private maybe. Most MS schools don't have the resources to support a consistent newspaper/yearbook/school TV news. All of the money is fundraised by their corresponding teacher sponsor and the students. You would also need certification in some other field.  There are two programs that come to mind which help you get your foot in the door to teach in MS: Teach For America and Mississippi Teacher Corps. Both programs are two years.   I'm sure you've heard of TFA, they place teachers mostly in the Delta area (rural and impoverished northwestern part of the state).  MTC is a graduate level program based out of the University of MS department of education. While teaching, you take coursework which gives you a masters of curriculum and instruction after two years. They place mostly in central and north MS."

Did an overnight a couple years ago on Black Creek and it was awesome. Extremely remote and quiet.   This past fall we did a two night trip down the Wolf on the coast. The river was low so we spent a lot of the first day dragging our canoes. The middle section had several pseudo-rapid spots. Clay made some pretty good narrow channels that were fun to ride out. The last stretch south of I-10 is completely flat and slow so it was work to get to the pull out.

mississippi,2yh9fj,Katiecorley17,5,Mon Mar 9 20:22:27 2015 UTC,"This place is on private property. It's maybe 30 minutes west of Hattiesberg. You'd take 98 west out of HB, till you hit 587 and go north maybe fifteen minutes. I think there may be a park there but back in the day this WAS the old 587. Now you'll drive in and park at the barricade, and walk in I think. 587 is a great little drive. It's sort of surprising to find scenery like that in Mississippi, but there you are. I think the road to Red Bluff is closed down because it's washed out, but you can probably park and walk in without anybody giving a shit. Just realize that red bluff is caused by erosion. If you're stupid enough to stand on the edge of it, and it crumbles, you're looking at maybe three hundred feet of tumbling down that hard old clay wall till you find the bottom. And when you do, some poor bastard has to go get help, and help has to collect its ass and go get you. You're going to be lying on your noggin at the bottom of a clay wall for hours, with all the snakes and the lizards, and if you're lucky they won't charge you with trespassing after you get out of teh hospital (if you live.)   Otherwise, enjoy the hike! It's worth the effort!  I grew up in Laurel, not too damned far from here. When I was little I camped out here with my best friend one summer and we managed to get mosquito bit, poison ivied, and scratched to hell from blackberry bushes. Good times!  I'm afraid they would take a dim view of two redneck kids camping out down there these days, but it's still a great trip.  EDIT: A little google-fu will help you greatly. Scott and I camped between the rr tracks and the river way back when. You could prolly still get down there but I would not recomend it. Stick with the open areas. THis site says people camp there but ymmv."

Mississippi is exactly what you make of it. You're going to find nice, welcoming people. They may tease you for being a Yankee, but they mean well.

mississippi,2xug0p,goboinouterspace,2,Wed Mar 4 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"Jack. WOW. A lot to say and not a lot of space to say it in. MS has numerous resources for numerous things. To take off on a few that you mention, you can drive west and see Sardis Lake. Much fishing and camping in this area. Drive a little farther east and make it to Tupelo. Plenty of entertainment and dining there. Lots of concerts happen there. I was born  and have lived in MS about 90% of my life. I am proud to call MS my home. Sure, there are some ""mixed up"" things about MS but there are plenty of argument of how ""mixed up"" things are in IL. You can't focus on all the bad and expect to have a good time. Ole Miss is well known for several of its    learning experiences. Law is one that comes to mind. Sports is another. What are you planning on your major to be? Where are you planning on living? Do you know anyone in or around the area?  Are you pretty much just blindly taking off to college and hoping for the best?

This is not a  knock on the business school, but the school of accounting is one of the best in the country. It will be difficult, but the reward is well worth it if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Also one thing I noticed coming from another very large public four year university is that the Greek system is huge at this school compared to most. It might be something nice to look into and a great way to meet some friends.  I had a wonderful experience in my year at Ole Miss. The campus is gorgeous and the teachers all care. Plus the women are beautiful. People are extremely friendly and helpful and I loved the smaller town feel of Oxford. You are going to have a great time."

As far as historical sites and such . . . that's kind of my expertise. : ) Make sure you check out Frankstown, Emerald Mound, and the ruins of Windsor while you are here.

mississippi,2xug0p,SemiHollowCarrot,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:20:36 2015 UTC,No. Never Been. Don't know anybody that close that has been. I do know that most options are 1. On campus/dorms 2. Off campus/in town. These are the most common. Outside of those it would be something rural or something in the next closest town that may or not be more than 10+ miles away. Lemme know.
mississippi,2xug0p,p8ntslinger,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:41:01 2015 UTC,"Hey! 2 things I don't think have been mentioned:  1) By far the best historical experiences you can have in Mississippi are going to the Natchez and Columbus pilgrimages. Most pre-civil war plantation mansions were destroyed by General Sherman, but those two places largely have them intact and have annual historical festivals where locals dress up in period clothing and offer free guided tours of the mansions explaining every detail of pre-civil war domestic life. There are also tie in events like balls, civil war reenactments, and the like. For a great driving experience that's both historical and showcases the natural beauty of the region (which is amazing - a lot of this land is undisturbed since prehistoric times) take a drive down the Natchez trace. You won't regret it.  2) ""The stereotypes"" is kind of a boogeyman word that people use because it's just so hard to wrap your head around what's going on here culturally. If you ever see things you don't understand (and there will be many), here's your central organizing theme that explains almost all of it: ""Most Mississippians have a very narrow comfort zone, and anything outside of that causes a response of confusion and anger."" The reaction thing is true for people in general, Mississippians just have a comparably narrow comfort zone that doesn't align well with the comfort zone of most Americans. There are plenty of reasons for this: growing up in MS it's easy to get stuck in an echo chamber and never experience anything but mainstream christian-american culture; it's a poor, agricultural state for the most part and it shows (Oxford is a cultural exception, but most of the other students you'll be there with will be coming from small town MS and reflect the echo chamber. This might be their first time away from a community dominated by the church they attend so expect them to wear it on their sleeve, for a while); and finally, culturally MS looks askance at ""book larnin"" so expect a lot of people to be very proud about being willfully ignorant. So ""the stereotypes"" aren't because people here are intrinsically evil, just that they're very sheltered in a narrow view that most Americans think of as backward. Yes, a lot of the economic and cultural problems are circular in cause with how the common Mississippian deals with scary new things, and yes you can certainly think a common Missisippian viewpoint is bad if it has bad results regardless if it is indicative of a willfully evil person, but just know what you see that might shock you is centrally about misunderstanding, not bad intentions. I really think the more intractable problems of MS are poverty, lack of education, and poor infrastructure.  Some people in this thread whose lifestyles are outside the comfort zone of MS are showing a very negative reaction, just take that as evidence that it is an incredibly grating experience to have most people look on you with fear and apprehension day after day because you are a cultural outsider; just know most Mississippians aren't inherently bad, the culture they're indoctrinated with just doesn't align with broader American culture and when the experience of being a cultural outsider is a day to day thing it can be really toxic, even if the acts any one individual contributing to that experience aren't that bad (1 person looks at you weird = probably no harm no foul; everyone you meet looks at you weird for your entire life = that's no bueno; both of these occur in functionally the same environment). Also there's very little counterculture to hide out in if you're not ""one of the kind."""

mississippi,2xug0p,work_account11,1 point,Wed Mar 4 14:45:22 2015 UTC,"I was born in Jackson, MS, went to high school in Batesville, MS, and lived in most large towns between Batesville and Memphis before eventually calling Memphis home for 10 years. I now consider myself a displaced Mississippian in Florida.   In high school I worked for a lawn service in Oxford during the spring and summer. I loved tending to the landscaping at the Tri Delta Sorority house and the surrounding sororities, it was every 16 year old boy's wet dream. You will be going to school with some of the most beautiful women in the world IMO.   Like others have said you'll be very close to Sardis lake which offers lots of fishing, swimming, camping and some neat nature trails. You'll also be relatively close to Enid Lake, Grenada Lake, and Arkabutla Lake. I personally love cruising across the dam that separates the upper and lower lakes at Sardis. The Mississippi wilderness is beautiful and has so much to offer. If you befriend any natives and they offer to take you hunting, fishing, or shooting then take them up on it. Your bound to have a very memorable experience.    Clarksdale, MS  About an hour and 10 minutes drive west of Oxford is a town called Clarksdale, MS which my entire family originates. It's known as the home of the blues and has some neat touristy stuff to do in that regard as well as a pretty cool revitalized downtown area and several museums that would really high light Southern culture and history. Keep an eye out for the Juke Joint festival and the Blue Festival dates as those are some of the best times to visit and get to see the blues culture and lots of Southern culture (food, art, literature, etc). Other than the festivals there's always fun to be had at Ground Zero or The Hopson Commisary, both legendary juke joints with lots of great live music ranging from jazz to rock to blues to country with reasonable sleeping arrangements near by.  If you have make any buddies at school from that area try to take a trip there for the weekend and get them to show you around. One of my favorite things to do when I'm in Clarksdale is cruise the gravel road on top of the Mississippi river levee stopping at the various sand bars and boat landings along the way to see the river, the wild life and just enjoy being outdoors. You can also do guided river canoe tours. I did it a few summers ago and absolutely loved it. Bring a guitar, some food, some beers. Relax and lets the tour guides paddle you up and down the windy river or feel free to grab a paddle and dig in. They'll show you stuff you'd likely never see or know about otherwise. It was an amazing experience and I'd highly recommend this tour guide. The owner is extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and fun to hang out with. He's one of those Mississippi hippy types.   Memphis, TN  About an hour and 20 minutes North of Oxford is Memphis, TN. There is so much to do there it's going to be hard to squeeze it all in. You have to go there and eat at The Germantown Commissary for some killer BBQ ribs, Central BBQ for awesome wings and pulled pork, and my newest favorite One and Only BBQ which has a killer BBQ briskett sandwich (which is unusual around there). Ask around, everyone has their own opinion on which BBQ joint is the best but you can't go wrong with any of them. You've also got to try Huey's. It's fairly inexpensive and offers a very laid back environment where your encouraged to shoot tooth picks at the ceiling and write on damn near everything. Bring a marker and check out there awesome world famous burgers.    Downtown Memphis has a lot to offer. Go there and visit Mud Island in the morning. It's got breathtaking views of the river and bridges as well as the small Memphis skyline. The scale model of the Mississippi River is very neat as well.  Eat lunch at Rendezvous then hit the bar at the Peabody hotel. If you can catch the sunset from one of the river side parks it's a site to be seen. I prefer the Confederate park as it's on top of the bluff but it's usually crowded with homeless people, they'll ask for change but are typically harmless. Once it gets dark stagger on over to Beale St and hear some live music, if you've got a lady friend take her for a carriage ride, those are usually pretty nice. Lots of good rock, soul, blues, country, and anything else you could imagine on any given night. For dinner hit Alfred's and try to get a seat on the balcony over looking the road. Alfred's has killer BBQ Nacho's and there's usually lots of young attractive woman to be seen around there on a Friday or Saturday night.  If the party scene isn't your thing try going to the Memphis Zoo, it is truly a world class zoo. If partying is your thing go to the beer tasting at the Memphis Zoo called Zoo Brew. I've had some of the best times I'll never remember there.   Check out the Mississippi Green Belt park just north of downtown Memphis in a high falutin area called Harbor Town. It has a nice river side walking trail. When your done go get some sweet tea from Miss Cordilia's, it's the best sweet tea in the world.   The Stack's museum is suppose to be pretty cool, I've never been though I hear it's worth visiting.  Check out Graceland if for no other reason than to get your picture there. The tours are expensive IMO but if you've for the disposable income it's worth it. Otherwise don't feel to left out. It's in the super ghetto so go during the day!  Shelby farms is an awesome park in the middle of Memphis, Bartlett, and Cordova. It's worth visiting and exploring. They've got a paved running/ walking/ biking trail all the way around the park that's usually packed with hot chicks (as you can tell by now I'm a pervert). They've also got nature trails that welcome mountain bikers, hikers, horse riders, runners, and weird goth kids making home made horror films (I've never see it but the scared the hell out of my mountain biking buddy one afternoon). They've also got a world class play ground that will make you wish you were a kid again. I use to go there with my 4 year old and go down the slides and play on the swings, you can do that when you're a daddy otherwise you'll look super creepy.   The trail system in Shelby farms, known as the Tour de Wolf, connects to the Wolf river trail system which is one of my favorite in the city. There are a lot of trails cut in that area. Some are for biking and horsing, while others are for runners and joggers but not bikes and horses while still others are for granola crunching hippies who will yell at you for walking to fast and fight you for riding anything. It's confusing but I never got in any trouble for riding my mountain bike on any and all of them.   If mountain biking is your thing then check out Stanky Creek in Bartlett, TN (suburb of Memphis). It's the best technical trail system in the city and has always been well maintained by the mountain biking community of Memphis known and The Mid South Trail Association. If you're not a biker it's fun to jog or just walk. I saw way more weird goth kids toward the BMX area in the back. They're a nuisance but mostly harmless.   TL/DRSo to summarize it all, I'd say try to make some local friends and have them show you what's cool to them in the mid-south. Visit Clarksdale listen to Blues, see the Mississippi river, eat soul food, cruise the levee. Visit Memphis, eat BBQ, go to Beale St, Mud Island, the Zoo, and Shelby Farms. I hope my wall of rambling incoherent text explains what I love about the mid south and why I love it. Not all the negative stereo types you hear about Mississippi are true but many of them do exist in some form or fashion and they're easily avoidable."

Check out some of these spots. http://www.msbluestrail.org/index.aspx Also, check out Reds in Clarksdale.  And while on the Gulf Coast, check out http://www.walterandersonmuseum.org/. In Jackson, check out http://mdah.state.ms.us/welty/.  In Oxford, Faulkner's Rowan Oak is worth a visit, and you aren't far from Tupelo for the birthplace of Elvis. That covers Mississippi's greatest painter, photographer, writer, and musical entertainer and most unique town. Check out the readings at Off Square Books often. Stay open to the possibility of joining a frat. Probably want to look into ""formal rush"" It is actually economically and socially beneficial in the long run. The Grove is more important than the game, and I really hope the Chicken on a Stick at Chevron is as good as when I lived there."

If you can get to the original one in Mason, TN (maybe 45 minutes from downtown Memphis) go there however do not put your feet up in the chairs, for the love of god just don't do it unless you want the tongue lashing of a life.   If you can't make it that far the one down town and the one between poplar and park are acceptable substitutes."

Memphis has fun entertainment and is really quite close, about an hour at a leisurely drive.  Oxford has some really good eating, although I might say the restaurants are generally more expensive than normal. We also have a ton of bars, for our size.  Taylor Catfish is a truly amazing experience, though it's immensely crowded and just about the only thing going strong in Taylor. That's like 20 minutes south of town.  Also Square Books is pretty cool to just go read a book in, maybe buy something every now and then, but they generally are okay with you just perusing. Good way to walk around the square without necessarily having to drink."

If you're not exactly all of that, someone down here hates your guts.  I'm a lesbian atheist, and this place is NOT good for my health. I plan on immigrating to another country in the next year. The only reason I'm here is because I was born here, but the whole south blows.   Personally, I went to MS State, and for a MS city, it was ok, but that's because it is a liberal college town. Ole Miss is basically the same, I think. However, the people here (as a general rule) are so freaking backwards, it's insane.  Other people probably like it here, and if I were straight, white, christian, and male, I probably would like it here too, but I'm not, so I don't. Just my two cents."

As far as the graffiti, I can't imagine how that is even relevant. Just because some person put something on a wall doesn't mean that it is some overarching sentiment that everyone is applauding. I'm not saying that everybody down is here is a complete angel or they don't have their faults, but to imply that you have to be straight, white, Christian, and male or else your tarred and feathered and chased from the town is insulting."
mississippi,2xug0p,swagkellyswag,8,Wed Mar 4 02:50:36 2015 UTC,"Churches aren't the only places to be ""social"" in Mississippi. I doubt that walking around with the mindset that ""the people here (as a general rule) are so freaking backwards, it's insane,"" is helping anyone make friends. Also, to say that if you aren't straight, white, Christian, and male, you can't find your place in Mississippi is ridiculous. The irony of all this is that she's thinking that the people around her are far too judgmental and it's keeping her from feeling at home, when she is the one who is stereotyping and overgeneralizing."

mississippi,2xqaz4,randumnumber,8,Tue Mar 3 02:02:16 2015 UTC,"As a frame of reference, I work and go to school at UMMC which is a major hub of Jackson. I have been here for several years, and really quite like it. It has everything that a big city offers, while not feeling like an overwhelming big city. Traffic is never bad, and generally, people here in Jackson are very accepting of and welcoming to ""outsiders"". The only drawback, as people have pointed out is the crime of central, south, and west Jackson.  If you want to live close to work, I would definitely suggest the Fondren or Belhaven area. They are both very pleasant, and generally younger which leads to more diversity. If you are looking for something a bit quieter and do not mind a commute, I would suggest Madison, Ridgeland, or Flowood. They are generally known as the nicer areas of Jackson Metro. Cleaner, newer, and generally safer. Allow me to say on the behalf of Mississippi, Welcome. Glad to have you!"
mississippi,2xqaz4,sirpatrick2418,2,Tue Mar 3 02:27:07 2015 UTC,Thank you for your help. I recently went down to Jackson to visit and interview for the job.

mississippi,2xqaz4,Nonexistence,7,Fri Apr 10 15:07:31 2015 UTC,"Any idea where you'll be living? Living in certain neighborhoods or other cities in the Jackson metropolitan area and commuting is fine, but living in the heart of Jackson is a dystopian hellscape with rates of burglary and violent crime so bad they'll make you double take because numbers that high just can't be real. Also prepare for a pretty big cultural adjustment... if you're not a very religious churchgoer, you might want to practice faking it for social reasons, and best to just never bring up anything about politics unless you live in a hermetically sealed fox news echo chamber. People will be at least superficially nice to you if you blend in though, and Mississippians are so good at that few outsiders ever learn to tell the difference."

mississippi,2xqaz4,poopdaddy2,3,Tue Mar 3 03:33:17 2015 UTC,"I'll be working downtown, close to the state capital building. No idea where I'll live. I'm looking into apartments, but have no idea where to start. Any suggestions?  Yea, I am not a conservative or religious person. I'm not a loudmouth about my beliefs, but I'm worried I'll feel very isolated from most people when it comes down to it. I want to actually have friends where I go.  But the experience I have with southern cities (Raleigh, Atlanta) is that they're much more ""hip"" than most give them credit for. Sure, it's more conservative overall, but there's still a heap of counter-culture to enjoy. Would Jackson fit into this?"
mississippi,2xqaz4,Nonexistence,5,Tue Mar 3 01:04:09 2015 UTC,"Jackson is obviously smaller than Raleigh and Atlanta, but it has a burgeoning artistic/music scene.  Check out the Fondren area, it's little but has some cool restaurants/bars/places. Also, I grew up in Jackson with no religion.  I never (to my knowledge) was shut off from social groups because of it. Neither were my parents. There's obviously those groups of people who throw some serious shade on you if you don't go to church every Sunday, but it's easy to avoid them and find like-minded people.    I would also suggest getting out and visiting other places around the state.  Oxford is a blast, Vicksburg and Natchez have a ton of history, Memphis and New Orleans are both 3 hours away. People give Jackson a bad rap, and I might have to if you asked me 5 or 6 years ago, but I've come to really appreciate it.  Edit: Werds and grammer and stuff"
mississippi,2xqaz4,Mremerkin,6,Tue Mar 3 01:15:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, I spent the last four years living a couple blocks from there (in college) and while for the most part I agree with what people are saying in this thread I'd be really, really remiss if I didn't say I think they're mischaracterizing safety, especially for that area.  I've scoped out Raleigh (that's where I'm working this summer) and it has a pretty cool metropolitan set up common to similar cities around the south. Jackson is not that. The ""downtown"" in most of these areas is where the cool, urban, young adult scene goes down - in Jackson downtown has been overrun by urban blight for a long time and is way too dangerous for that. People are talking up Fondren, but even in Fondren you can walk 5 blocks in any direction and be in a ghetto. I'd say downtown by the capital, for a young woman riding a bike, is probably the most dangerous place in Jackson besides just wandering through the hood (which you should also be careful about avoiding).   Really be careful about downtown, especially at night. Poindexter park in particular right next to the capital is a big violent crime hot spot. If you bike around downtown, expect to be at the very least harassed on a daily basis by scary drug addled homeless people. I'm not trying to sound hyperbolic, but for safety you really, really need a car for the work situation you're describing. Jackson isn't a bikeable city anyway.   I lived in a fraternity house on campus surrounded by a big barbed wire fence, but over my time there we were still stolen from a bunch of times, including brothers being assaulted by burglars breaking in and lying in wait in their bedrooms. Again, not trying to scare you, but please take it seriously.  As for where to live, check out Ridgeland, Flowood, and Pearl."

I'd say your first priorities would be finding transportation and then finding a place that's safe and fits in your budget."
mississippi,2xqaz4,breakbread,2,Tue Mar 3 01:16:56 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of people that lean left - and with the HRC opening an office in Jackson - they have been very active in doing community outreach - with good success. There is a counter culture, but I wouldn't say there is heaps of it. You have to search it out.  Southerners (MS southerners) can sometimes be a tough nut crack. My two best friends moved to MS from upstate NY - and they had a hard time figuring out how to find community. People have known each other for generations in MS. Everybody knows everybody - and  for that reason working your way into community can be tough.  Most people make connections on Sunday mornings - which evidently isn't really your cup of tea. But don't feel like that will make you an outsider. But do know, that you will be invited to church on many different occasions by different people.  It is a good town - plus you will only be a few hours from New Orleans."
mississippi,2xqaz4,PavlovianTactics,3,Tue Mar 3 17:03:49 2015 UTC,"Anthony Bourdain recently did an episode of Parts Unknown in the MS Delta, but he visits Jackson in the episode. Check it out."
mississippi,2xqaz4,ObzestWithFood,3,Tue Mar 3 01:18:55 2015 UTC,"What type of person are you in general? What's your budget? As you already know, budget in particular is going to be the primary factor in determining your options.    If you dig eclectic urban environments that are in a state of change, Fondren is where all the cool, hip gentrification is going down in the Jackson area. (full disclosure: I live there but am neither cool nor hip)  It's adjacency to to areas many consider undesirable is both a strength and a weakness, depending on your sensibilities.  But if suburbs stress you out, it's really the only neighborhood worth looking into.    Madison is the perennial and quintessential middle-to-upper-middle-class-90% white suburban city. Many in the Jackson area love to hate on Madison, either out of envy or simply the hilarity that it's juxtaposition with much of the surrounding area inspires. As someone who amateurishly enjoys urban/city planning, I think Madison is neat.  That said, single occupant renting isn't really feasible here.  If you're buying, property value is pretty high in general, but tapers off outside the city limits (130s - 150s).   Ridgeland sits between Madison and Jackson and it shows. Like one of those arts and crafts pieces where you stick the crayons to the top of a board and hit them with a hair-dryer or heat gun. But I'm not hating. Ridgeland is the more ethnically diverse and potentially inexpensive counterpart to Madison.  Not to mention there are apartments in Ridgeland, as well as a more affordable rental market.  It also has better access to the reservoir if you're into that sort of thing.   North Jackson is a hodge-podge of blight and wealth.  The area around the Whole Foods and various private schools ranges from pretty nice to rather wealthy, but is otherwise unremarkable in my opinion. Before I found my current place, though, I did come across a number of decently priced rental houses in that area around Whole Foods.  Off the top of my head, though, I don't believe there are any solid apartment options here.    Pearl/Brandon/Flowood is just one big contiguous area that I think is more-or-less the same, though some may object.  Pearl is definitely the redheaded step child (incidentally, I'm pretty sure that's a Southern idiom, at least the origin) of the Jackson area suburbs.  If Madison is hyperbole for white middle-class, Pearl is hyperbole for white trash (obligatory 'I have close friends in Pearl').  Brandon and Flowood are much like Madison and Ridgeland for the most part.  Property values run the gamut and there's a healthy amount of general commerce complete with plenty of sprawl.  In general they're a bit more detached from Jackson proper than Ridgeland and even Madison.    There are, of course, plenty of areas I didn't mention.  But I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that by virtue of you making a post such as this in the first place, these areas likely would not appeal to you.      As for the people, there is likely as much truth as there is hyperbole to any of the stereotypes you are aware of or predisposed to expect.  The two elephants in the room are, of course, religion and racism and both are prevalent but probably not as overt as many would have you believe.  As a non-militant-non-believe, I have no problem carrying and minding my own business."
mississippi,2xqaz4,jay-ayron,2,Tue Mar 3 13:03:14 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of the best summaries in the thread. As for apartment complexes, look at Vieux Carre off I55. It's a gated community with mostly UMMC students so it's pretty safe."
mississippi,2xqaz4,chronopoly,3,Tue Mar 3 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to write all of that out. My SO and I just moved here this past weekend. Both of us had amazing job opportunities that we didn't want to turn down. We've both lived all over the south and just relocated from Nashville, TN. We came and spent a week in Jackson to find a place to live and really enjoyed our visit. There has been a good amount of people both in Nashville and here in Jackson that like to throw in their negative opinion of, ""Why would you move to Jackson?"" or ""I hope the money is worth it...""   It's rude to say and I've just started correcting people. Where you live is what you make of it. I also think that in order for the city to change, it's important that people move into the Fondren and Belhaven areas. If everyone keeps running away from the city, it has no chance of changing of getting better. We lived in East Nashville (Google it, there's plenty of information on its re-gentrification) and though it was getting a little more popular than we cared for, we loved our little neighborhood on the outskirts. Our next door neighbor was an active drug dealer and a really nice guy. Our other neighbors were of similar backgrounds and then there were two houses that had been redone that sold for $380k in the same block. People still got mugged in our neighborhood, but in reality it was the same type of person every time. Always the people who aren't paying attention and the easy target, the girl with her huge Gucci purse walking home drunk at 2am. Be street smart and just be aware."

Like in any city, you need to be careful, and crime is higher than anyone would like. But the idea that you have to decamp to Madison or Brandon to be safe is an idea promoted mainly by, well, Madison and Brandon, and the outsized Jackson fear sometimes has some sociological forces behind it that I'll leave it to your imagination to suss out, because it's exactly what you think it is (this certainly is not true for all suburb-dwellers). Check out Fondren, Belhaven, and other similar neighborhoods. Look for dead-end quiet streets if you want to minimize property crimes of opportunity.  As to culture, etc., it's there if you seek it out, and sometimes even if you don't. And, yes, Jackson IS philosophically diverse enough that you should be able to find a coterie of like-attituded folks."

It's mind boggling to me that people still live in that area. Just recently a older lady was killed in Belhaven while being robbed. Fondren def has great food and a great night life but would not want to live there.   Your best bet is flowood ( some great apartments around the dogwood market area) , madison, or ridgeland. I personally live in Brandon and commute 30 min drive to fondren for work and I would not change anything about it."
mississippi,2xqaz4,Mremerkin,2,Tue Mar 3 12:00:27 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna be lazy and copy and past my comment from the last time a non-Mississippian asked this question:  People always, ALWAYS seem to talk about how bad we are in the south, and how we hate everyone who isn't a white southern. That's THE biggest load of crap I've ever heard. I work with people, know people, am friends with people from different countries, different states, with different creeds and colors. All of them, every one of them, is blown away by how nice, polite, and open to others we are down here. The people who told you you'd be hated have never been here. If they ever had, they'd say the opposite.  It really ticks me off to be honest. I've talked to people that have come here, stayed a bit, fell in love with the place, moved back or visited they're home, and they're family and friends are almost appalled.  ""Oh my god! You lived there?! With THOSE people?!""  ""Well to be honest, they're much nicer than the people here, and it's a nice place to live for the most part.""  ""Ah! What have they done to you?""  Sorry about the rant. It's hard not to feel attacked at times by the rest of the country when you're from here. Oh yeah, my mothers originally from New Jersey, moved here at the age of 20 I believe, and fit right in.  Yes people can be a bit too conservative, a bit too religious, but will you feel burdened by it? NO. Is it even remotely close to being as bad as the stereotype? NO. Will you never talk to, or know anyone who has completely different beliefs than the stereotypes. NO. Will you never meet or know people who believe like you? NO.  It's really just like anywhere else, but we move a little slower, and we are a little nicer."

The ops question called for a saltier response. I simply gave you an example of how a huge majority of the country thinks of us. You in a way asked if it's as bad as non deep southerners make it out to be, and I gave you my perspective. You'll be fine is my point. My apologizes if I bothered you."

A lot depends on where you will be working (location), where you can afford to live, and the commute between points A and B.   The stereotypes you have to worry about are the same that you'll have to worry about with any mid-sized city. There are places where you DO NOT want to go, places where you won't be welcomed with open arms for one reason or another, and places where you just can't afford. What you want to focus on is how much of your life would be spent traversing or hanging out in the aforementioned areas, and how much will be spend outside of those."

You might as well say that it doesn't exist.   I'm sure there are those that have lived in Jackson more recently than I have that can suggest locations based on better knowledge, but me, I'd pretty much want to live out to the South East, or North. South East doesn't have transit, to the North you've got at least 2 transfers so a commute isn't going to be easy.   Any likelihood of acquiring a cheap but efficient vehicle before the move?"

mississippi,2xqaz4,alfonso_x,6,Tue Mar 3 00:55:14 2015 UTC,"You will, WITHOUT A DOUBT, need a vehicle. Public transportation is not a viable option in Jackson, MS or any other town in Mississippi for that matter. It's just not going to be reliable or efficient enough to consider using public transportation. Plus, Mississippi's most interesting places are totally unreachable by public transport. Also, in regards to whether Mississippi is going to be a good fit for you...who knows? Come visit and see for yourself first. I've been here my entire life, traveled the globe, and am still proud to call Mississippi my home. There's ALWAYS something interesting going on in the Jackson area, the cost of living here is extremely low, and the food here is exceptionally good. Finally, look into living in one of three places, Fondren or Belhaven if you want an environment closer to city life or an apartment in Flowood for a more affordable and significantly safer area. If you do chose Belhaven or Fondren, get a roomate. To be brutally honest, it's just not safe enough for a single female to live there.  Good luck with your decision."

Mississippi already takes a lot more money from the federal government than we give back. Pretty much everything in MS is under-funded: our schools, universities, infrastructure, etc. We come in last place on virtually every meaningful ranking. Cutting taxes (i.e., cutting public budgets) isn't gonna help that.    Clearly, these chronic problems aren't automatically solved by throwing money at them-- but that's definitely part of the solution. You can't cut billions from the education of the state (which already ranks poorly on a national scale) and expect it to not get worse."

I found several articles discussing the tuition hikes (around 5% at the big three schools) for 2014-15. One of the articles mentioned that this round of hikes restored the funding levels to 2010 levels, before funding cuts by the state legislature. So, we've been raising tuition costs like crazy, just to get back to funding levels from 5 years ago. Just great."

I had a long, painful conversation with a colleague recently after he stated with complete sincerity that ""Obama hates America and wants to ruin it.""  He just couldn't bring himself to accept that anyone could just disagree with him on economic policy unless they're evil and out to hurt people.  What I tried to get him to see was that honest, good people can come to different conclusions on issues, especially economic issues, and still both be coming from the right place, a place of wanting to help everyone.

mississippi,2x4jw8,Vhaine,3,Wed Feb 25 19:54:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. I gave them the deposit when this whole thing started, well over a year ago. My neighborhood now sits at something like 5%, and they want 35% signed up before they roll it out. My $10 is basically gone.   As you said, the problem is there is no tangible product. If they could go to people in my neighborhood and tell them they could switch to their service today, I think they would see more people do it. Asking them to hand over money on the potential that we may get their service isn't going to work."
mississippi,2x4jw8,hells_cowbells,1 point,Wed Feb 25 23:08:27 2015 UTC,"The reason for the signup is perhaps not obvious on the surface, but clear once you think about it. CSpire is closed mouth about their finances, they are entirely privately held, and a Mississippi company, both rare for their size. But at any rate... they are trying to reach the mark of 1 billion in revenue, not profits like other companies, just revenue. So they are big, but not that big.   Given that information it's clearer, they can provide the service, the infrastructure to do it is part of their cell tower network, that's where the fiber backbone comes from. What they cannot do is what Google is doing, wire every neighborhood and then wait for signups, that would bankrupt them. So instead they are going to wire the neighborhoods with known customers, and known cash flow into their pockets rather than just out. That still won't turn an initial profit but sure helps. Once those places are wired up and serviced they hope word of mouth will keep things going.  But as far as options go if you want more the only way is to leave Mississippi. I recently moved to a newly announced Google Fiber city, and I will still be waiting up to two years to get it. Running fiber takes time, and lots of money.  But having formerly worked at CSpire I can assure you of one thing, it's no scam, it is just economics at work."
mississippi,2x4jw8,spychipper,2,Thu Feb 26 00:16:52 2015 UTC,"I've given CSpire my last dollar about 3 months ago.   Once they switched to the cspire name... every metric of their 'service' went down hill. Speeds were slower, calls dropped more frequently, customer service was less effective, bills went up, etc.   I switched to big red back in november and while I'm giving them a few more bucks a month, their service is spectacular against every metric (except customer service, I havent had to call) including rural coverage, both from the map perspective and speeds in those rural areas.   I think the gigabit ethernet thing distracted them as a company and now, as far as i can tell... nobody is actually getting it... theyre just asking everybody to give them 10 or 20 bucks to maybe come in their area."

mississippi,2x4jw8,ghostofpennwast,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:29:38 2015 UTC,"Until last summer the fiber unit was a separate, but wholly owned subsidiary, so I find that doubtful. Likely what happened is shorty after I left they rolled out a new billing system, which being a major change impacted the customer service. Things likely spiralled from there, and the way things work will recover by the end of this summer.   Bad service equals bad perception all around, even if nothing else has changed."
mississippi,2x4jw8,spychipper,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:03:20 2015 UTC,"Yep. I had been a Cellular South/Cspire wireless customer for about 10 years. After the name change, and their drive to increase business, their service went to crap. When I first went with them in the early 2000s, I got great service. People in the stores cared. I got real humans who were willing to help on their customer service number. Now? They are no different than the other wireless carriers.  I finally got frustrated with their terrible wireless performance. My service went from 3-4 bars at my home, to 1-2, if I was lucky. I would leave my house, and a few blocks down the road, I would get notifications of missed emails and texts. They said it was my phone, not their service. Oddly, the phone worked fine elsewhere. And their ""4G"" service is a joke. I was consistently getting 3-5 M/bps. The best speed test I ever got was somewhere around 10. I also get fed up with their terrible Android phone selection. I think they are still selling year+ old versions of the HTC One and Moto X.   Good riddance. The only reason I paid the deposit for their fiber service is because Comcast is actually worse than Cspire. Not that my neighborhood will ever get the service, mind you."
mississippi,2x4jw8,hells_cowbells,2,Thu Feb 26 15:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah... the ""unlimited"" thing was a sham. I am pretty sure i was routinely throttled... I would have 3G speeds when I'm standing next to someone who was showing 4G speeds."
mississippi,2x4jw8,goobersmooch,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:48:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. I also notice that they are no longer advertising it as a feature, so I guess they don't offer it on new plans anymore. The thing is, mine was always that slow. After I switched to AT&T last year, I've been seeing 20 Mbps or more in lots of places. The speed difference is amazing. I can also buy a phone unlocked and bring it to my service."
mississippi,2x4jw8,hells_cowbells,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:54:02 2015 UTC,"You worry about $10, but you're going to sign up for $1000/year Internet service? You're not the target market. They don't want people who worry about $10, because those people won't stick with them and pay off the huge investment in infrastructure required. They want people who will treat it as a purchase like a lottery ticket - a small sum spent in the hopes of reaping a very large reward.  If I thought it would work, I'd pay the fees for people in order to sign up enough houses in my neighborhood to hit the mark. It would cost less than $1500, and I'd easily pay that much if it would get fiber to my house. (Alas for me, they're not run by idiots and have thought of this, and if you work for Cspire, no, I'm not the guy with the cool map tool who mentioned this idea to you, but I do know him.)"

mississippi,2wwic4,rotll,1 point,Wed Feb 25 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"Two pellets from a shotgun sounds more like collateral damage rather than someone trying to kill the dog.  Have you considered that the dog might have just been in the wrong place at the wrong time, and it was simply an accident?"
mississippi,2wwic4,rotll,1 point,Tue Feb 24 13:42:46 2015 UTC,"two pellets of buckshot aren't collateral damage, that is 25 percent the load. Also, what are they hunting at 830 in the morning in late February with buckshot? the only open seasons are critter (rabbit, quail, 'coon, 'possum and crow) not anything you'd use a large pellet for..."
mississippi,2wwic4,Andrew4Mayor,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:50:03 2015 UTC,"Just offering alternatives.  Someone handy with a 12 gauge targeting the dog could have done much more damage, hence the reason I wondered if it might have been an accident.  I hope Josie heals quickly.  Pet injuries are not fun for anyone."
mississippi,2ws56g,dumpsterKraken,2,Sun Feb 22 18:31:21 2015 UTC,Look at the Baptist Healthplex.
mississippi,2ws56g,TrailerParkJedi,2,Sun Feb 22 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"The Baptist Healthplex is really nice.  You might also check out The Club at St. Dominic's (http://www.theclubms.com/find-a-club/the-club-at-st-dominics). The YMCA off of Fortification is surprisingly good. Finally, the Courthouse Downtown is good if you want to get into that system (though that particular location location doesn't have a swimming pool).  I'm a big fan of the other Courthouse locations, but they're a bit far from Belhaven.  Good luck!"

If I had a book club going on a bus and I drove it I would need a CDL.   Also, if a CDL is REALLY unneccessary, just get rid of the license. Don't have a worthless license required anyways. Or they could allow people to take the tests online and come in for the driving portion or something to reduce cost."

mississippi,2w9pxa,goboinouterspace,8,Wed Feb 18 02:54:54 2015 UTC,"I am one of those workers they are talking about. Although I'm not a ""temp"" worker, I work for a ""contractor"" company. We do the exact same work as the 23+/hr workers, but for 1/2 the pay. It took me three years to become ""full time"". Although my company offered benefits for the ""provisional"" workers, the cost was so astronomically high that most people couldn't afford it. Right now, I pay 66.10 per WEEK for insurance for just my wife and myself. If I had gotten all three of my children on it as well, it would have cost me 131.00~ per week.  Nissan does hire people from the temp agency (Kelly Services), if they survive for two years. That isn't a guarantee, either. Most people average 5 years in a temp position with a cap of 12.00/hr. and are strictly limited on hours.  Nissan in canton uses at least five subcontractor companies, all of which are seriously underpaid. They have no access to the perks that ""nissan"" employees get. Nissan very rarely ever promotes from within. All supervisory and technical jobs like engineering are all outside hires directly through Nissan. They require crazy experience and degrees to obtain.   My Wife and I worked there with a subcontractor company (I'm still there with them currently), She was terminated when she developed Cervical Cancer. I will be leaving there as soon as her surgery is done. I'm only staying there for the overpriced insurance at this point. I have zero chance for promotion, and this underhanded crap just seals the deal for me."
mississippi,2w9pxa,Paradigm_Pizza,-3,Wed Feb 18 03:27:52 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure if the article was about education or Nissan and their (pretty common) use of subcontractors. If you aren't getting paid enough, then quit. Fyi, it would be over $400 a month for my wife, my 1 child, and myself to be covered by my wife's insurance (teacher, through the state) so it doesn't sound like it is much different in cost for public employees.  MAEP issue is complicated, and since my wife is a teacher, she's being hit in all directions with crazy information. If you want the state to fully fund the program they agreed to, fine, but don't use articles comparing apples to oranges (""underfunded by the same amount of tax breaks Nissan got!"" Or ""look at how much each school gets vs how much the staff is paid!"")."
mississippi,2w9pxa,z6joker9,5,Wed Feb 18 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"Not everyone can afford to just ""quit"" their job. Life doesn't work like that. Have a little compassion for the guy who just said he's leaving after his wife's surgery for cervical cancer.   MAEP issue is not complicated at all (I am a licensed teacher as well). If you look at the spending of each district, you will see a trend across the state. I call it the ""federal cash grab."" A great example of this is Desoto County Schools and Jackson Public Schools. Lots of money being spent, just not on the students. Then you have schools like Panola, who can't even afford textbooks. There is a complete mismanagement going on. If we can't afford schools with working toilets and textbooks, we certainly can't afford for a district to employ 20+ secretaries in a central office and pay them all more than a teacher's salary.   Anyway I'll get off my soap box now, but I believe the point of the article is the let people know how jacked up these tax cuts for the rich turned out to be. Instead of paying for our own we are just doing Nissan a favor. The biggest employer in the state of Mississippi IS the state of Mississippi. Why isn't it Nissan?   edited to add: Since we're comparing apples and oranges, it's also pretty cute how Colorado pulled in about the same amount in marijuana taxes last year as Mississippi was short on paying for medicaid."
mississippi,2w9pxa,z6joker9,1 point,Wed Feb 18 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"My apologies for coming off so harsh- my point was, people are paid what they are willing to work for. I'm not always happy with my wage, but I blame no one but myself for it, as my decisions have led me to it and further decisions can allow me to change it.  Your second paragraph is exactly why MAEP is a complicated issue. What you mentioned isn't what MAEP is about at all. MAEP is simply a formula that says ""each student needs $X for education, and in poor areas especially, they can't come up with that amount using ad valorem, so the state will supplement to make sure every child gets a good baseline education."" The formula makes adjustments for performance (schools using the money well get more), attendance, special needs, etc. If a school district is mismanaging money, such as your example, giving them more state money isn't going to fix the problem."
mississippi,2w9pxa,z6joker9,2,Wed Feb 18 13:23:11 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you. I also wanted to tell you about a facebook group called Desoto County Reform you and your wife might be interested in, even if you aren't from Desoto County (I'm not). It's basically an educational watchdog group if ya'll are interested in that sort of thing. They've never spammed me and the lady who runs it has shared some really interesting information. Just thought I'd let you know since your wife's a teacher."
mississippi,2w9pxa,Paradigm_Pizza,2,Wed Feb 18 13:32:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks- my wife, my sister, and my sister in law are all teachers, among others in the family, so I'm surrounded by teacher chatter all the time. Will look into the group."

It's not gonna happen.  I mean you can just keep wishing all you want and furiously posting anecdotal stories about some dude with a paper at a bar, but it's just not going to happen this decade.  Come back in 5 years after there's been some movement on the federal level and there hasn't been some huge legal/social backlash on CO and maybe...just maybe.
