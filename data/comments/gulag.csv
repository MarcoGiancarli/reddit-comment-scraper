Now I'm aware that Furr writes voluminously, so I checked out the bibliography. It's a little unusual for 80% of an historian's bibliography to consist of his or her own sources, but no matter. I don't have time to comb through the whole thing, but I decided to take one example: the Trotsky paper from ""Cultural Logic"" in 2009. I've read Furr before, and sure enough, this paper conforms to his usual method. I've copied his working hypothesis below:  ""a thorough search of published documents from the former Soviet archives would turn up more evidence of Trotsky’s collaboration with Germany and Japan other than that given at the three Moscow Trials.""  In other words, Furr, like an American DA in an election year, primarily relies on confessions coupled with internal documents that agree with those confessions. Later, we get this:  ""In this essay I assume that the larger the number of individual items of evidence that are all consistent with a single interpretation the less is the chance that they, and that interpretation, are the result of some kind of 'orchestration' or fabrication according to a preconceived plan. This should be especially so in the case of documents which were never intended to be public at all. When combined with evidence from documents that were never directly related to any prosecution, the likelihood of fabrication becomes very small indeed.""  This is not the province of history - this is, again, the province of bad lawyers. It is in fact, ""ahistorical."" To establish historical truth, one must critically examine primary sources - their provenance, authorship, function, and so on. Furr's method, if I'm being generous, is to do the opposite: he takes each source (from the Soviet archives, of course) at absolute face value, then weighs which historical narrative has more documents behind it. (And examine the discussion of Trotsky's telegram above to see that I am indeed being generous; in that case, a random pencil-scribbling by Stalin is taken as proof positive of Trotsky's guilt.) This is a completely nonsensical method.  Why is it nonsensical? Suppose I wanted to ascertain whether the defendants in the Central Park Jogger case were guilty. Suppose I were to rely completely on state archival evidence. What would I find? I would find two separate trials in which the defendants were convicted; I would find complete confessions from each of them; I would find a defense attorney who was a sexist asshole and tried to blame the victim; I would find every newspaper in the country agreed these men were guilty.  And guess what? I'd be wrong. They were exonerated by DNA many years later. But I reached my conclusion the exact same way that Furr does: by taking evidence at face value on the condition that it forms a coherent narrative. Such a method automatically dismisses evidence that contradicts the dominant narrative. If I had examined my evidence in a way that critiqued the power structure in this instance, I'd have likely reached a very different conclusion.  I hope that my long response does not suggest that I consider Furr ""worth responding to."" He is not. I am responding specifically to you because you are clearly interested in these things, and there is no reason for you to spend years misdirecting your energies. You can find people like that online. You can find them at protests, selling the latest issue of Worker's Vanguard. It's not a pretty sight. Furr himself is not, as far as I know, an active Communist in any capacity. I suspect his obsession got the better of him many years ago. As an  obsessive myself, I sympathize, but there is no need to emulate him.  Since you really do seem keen on Soviet history, I recommend you look into J. Arch Getty's books - his actual books, not the random citations you'll find on Reddit. I don't say this out of any particular agreement with Getty - you may even find some of your views vindicated by him. But he is at least a scholar who takes historical methodology seriously."

I won't watch this one because I trust it will be shite and his smug tone is so damn annoying.   I remember thinking about making a youtube account in a similar style to these people but I'd rather not be associated with these types. It generally tends to be a bunch of redditor types, usually middle class mid 20s, that are either circle-jerking or stabbing each other in the back. All of their sources, if they ever use them, are either wikipedia articles or shit like buzzfeed or huffpost and very rarely some bourgeois/reactionary big media site. And people eat that shit up but I guess it makes them feel intellectually superior without having to think for themselves. Occasionally I've had people not even attempt to argue with me nowadays, they literally just post a youtube link and say something like ""watch this and then you'll get it"" and return to the comfort of not having to make an actual effort.   Sometimes, I must admit, part of me is jealous. Part of me wishes I was in a situation which allowed me to just switch off from the world and relax in the bliss of ignorance until I go back to the void but I remind myself, that's just the bourgeois propaganda working and, moreover, that will never happen because the world quickly catches up to working plebs like me if they stop producing surplus to be expropriated. Of course, I recognise the privilege I have- especially now when I'm mostly just waiting for the next university term to start so pissing about on reddit and playing videogames while waiting to hear whether some petty bourgeois uppity prick has decided, in all their benevolence to give me a chance of interview to be employed for a job I don't actually need while I have state loans and multiple friends I can live with if I've no money when my rent contract runs out (perhaps not that privileged if homeless).

He constantly complains about the semantics of the argument he's facing and then immediately engages in the same argumentation he's complaining about. (Calling into question the subjective nature of prestigious jobs, then applying subjectivity to paint STEM as such, while also creating quite a hasty generalization)  Next he trots out a favorite argument of his, the Dictionary definition of a term, and creates a transparently shit argument about women being privileged because of diversity quotas. There are numerous issues with the assertions he makes there.  The argument exists in a vacuum, it ignores the discrimination that exists in the promotion and wage practices without standards to protect against it. Something his own sources reference. He makes several statements about how governments would dissolve private companies, even though his own source says that dissolution wasn't part of the proposal as it stands. He then tries to state that women would be hired without merit into positions because of these standards, while completely ignoring that none of his sources say anything about specifics or even if they control hiring standards based on merit. He pulled this assumption right out of his ass.  The hilarious part about his pro-privatization bias is that if the standards only enforce percentage driven quotas and don't interfere with merit-based practices, that would mean that businesses would be free to implement new positions or expand the pool of applicants to find qualified women to meet the quota. The only point this wouldn't be the selected approach would be when a private company elects to save money by hiring the first women that come through the door, regardless of merit. That means that private companies would be at fault for not hiring based on merit, not the state. tl;dr makes no mention of this obvious flaw.  It gets even more laughable when he ignores the portion of one his own sources that says:   Jennifer Whelan and Robert Wood of Melbourne Business School found that women who were appointed to senior management under American affirmative-action policies are seen as ""less qualified, less competent and less legitimate in their role"" than their male colleagues, or women appointed without targets or quotas—though there is no research evidence that they actually are.   Note the sees part. Women are perceived to be less qualified, but tl;dr couldn't seem to find anything to prove this, nor could his own source show that they are actually are less qualified. Which one would assume should have been a goal if he wanted his bullshit to be taken seriously.  There are several other sections of his two sources that he conveniently ignores because they run counter to his assumptions about privilege.  like this:   One study found that a commitment by hiring committees to shortlists with at least 25% women helped to remove anti-woman bias.   Another user here pointed out the common tactic of argumentation by YouTube videos instead of actual effort, tl;dr does this right in his own video. Sounds like he has a large bit of confirmation bias flopping around in his head.  That's just the first 5 minutes, and judging by the other videos of his I've seen, it won't change."

You were pointing out a contradiction in AnCap, so you are fine.  Most of the time, it works out that a non-reactionary post in a reactionary sub is downvoted, making the total score negative, and the gulag sentence 0 years. But when it doesn't, we can look at the post and determine if it is reactionary or not."

gulag,39ojkv,ajrhug,7,Sat Jun 13 23:28:20 2015 UTC,"So fighting racism and sexism doesn't help the working class?    From someone who's not a complete asshat.   To be more nuanced about things... Marxist theorists argued that racism and sexism were products of Capitalism. This, in turn, implied that if you really wanted to get rid of racism and sexism, you had to oppose Capitalism. Attack the roots, and all the rest will just whither away. SJWs, or to be more formal ""people who believe in Intersectional Social Justice,"" do not subscribe to the idea that Capitalism is the root cause of racism and sexism. Rather, they subscribe to Intersectionality, which argues that all of these different hierarchies of oppression exist independently from each other yet interact with each other. No single hierarchy of oppression can be fairly described as the 'root' of the others .  This leads the ideologies into inevitable conflict. Marxism makes everything about class (ultimately). Radical Feminism makes everything about gender. SJWism, at least when consistently applied (they often are not consistent and often slide back into Radical Feminism, particularly with respect to the issue of homophobia), does not treat one specific form of oppression as ""more important"" than the others.  But Marxists argue that focusing on racism/sexism directly is a distraction from the real job, which is to attack Capitalism. To a Marxist, SJWism is at best ""treating the symptoms and not the disease."" At worst, SJWism is seen as a Capitalist plot to distract people away from the root cause of all forms of social oppression, and thereby to perpetuate this oppression through fragmenting the anti-Capitalist movement into blocs which squabble with each other.   IDK if we have a master gulag, but this person deserves it."
gulag,39ojkv,lovelybone93,3,Sat Jun 13 11:18:18 2015 UTC,"While I agree-- one thousand years gulag for all, identity politics has no place in the movement and is often manifested as bourgeois. That's not to say anti-ableism, -racism, -sexism, etc. are not absolutely essential, but elements of this person's critique, while not exactly critical and are poorly articulated, enveloped in reactionism, are actually legitimate points for internal discussion."
gulag,39ojkv,jewish-mel-gibson,10,Sat Jun 13 11:41:20 2015 UTC,"identity politics has no place in the movement and is often manifested as bourgeois   Yeah, without a doubt. But that's not what's being discussed here - the issue with these fuckwits is that they equate a political rejection of ID politics with a political rejection of fighting around issues of race, gender, sexuality and the like.   Actually, what marxists should do and what the marxist political tradition is built upon is championing the cause of all the oppressed - of women, ethnic minorities, queer people, oppressed nationalities, you name it.   Understanding that oppression is rooted in class society should not mean that we only focus on purely economic questions.   The union movement has a proud history of campaigning for equal pay, for LGBTI rights and for civil rights. And more often than not it was socialists and communists who lead those unions and lead those struggles.  Anyone who does not support the struggle of the oppressed spits in the face of that tradition and should not in any way call themselves a socialist, marxist or a part of ""the left""."

Anti-pozi is very specifically an alt-right subreddit (ie, reactionary and traditionalist), not NS/white nationalist. As far as I'm concerned, NS and fascism were the radical right trying to broaden its audience by superficially pandering to leftism, and I reject it. Reactionary thought is further to the right than NS/fascism in every way.""  (I ask what that means)  ""Neo-feudalism is one of the directions of reactionary thought, but I'm actually more in favour of pre-enlightenment absolutism and cuius regio, eius religio - I see the late 16th century Holy Roman Empire as an example of a decentralised empire that successfully bridged intra-national and inter-national relations while allowing religious toleration on the level of individual rulers and their realms, but not individuals themselves. As for human biodiversity, there are obvious differences between human populations, and I think it's natural and healthy for the long-term stability of people and realms to be ethnocentric and consider their tribe/population before others.

The books themselves are not necessarily bad things, but most people on the economic left who believe in restricting the powers of big business are going to dislike the message of Atlas Shrugged. And most of this theme is verbalized within the novel by John Galt, which is why, here in /r/gulag (and in other leftist subreddits), people are not going to think very highly of the political beliefs of anyone who identifies themselves as John Galt."

All he knows is that there is some shitty shit happening revolving Israel, and he feels the need to express his solidarity with people enduring shitty shit in those happenings which resolve around Israel.  Anecdotally speaking, I wore a Ukrainian armband through part of high school to express solidarity with people enduring shitty shit in Ukraine. I was just starting to explore leftist tendencies when the conflict was getting some media attention, bit I was aware of the issue due to a Ukrainian friend. As it turns out, the armband I wrote was supposedly distributed by a fascist organization. I educated myself later on the conflict in Ukraine.  The point is that I kind of feel for this person. I wore my fascist armband in an attempt to bring attention to the conflict in Ukraine and express solidarity for the people affected by the conflict, which might just be what this kid is trying to do."
gulag,37xagt,jcstatt,13,Thu Jun 11 06:47:45 2015 UTC,"Another one: http://i.imgur.com/w2ce9Kz.jpg  Actual Twitter Account: https://twitter.com/anarchozionist  This travesty of an ""ideology"" is possibly even more infuriating than ""Anarcho-Capitalism"". I found this blog post laying out its trumped-up tenets. Acolytes of Anarcho-Zionism tenuously claim legitimacy to the anarchist tradition because Sam Dolgoff said some nice words about Israel after he visited with his wife in the 1970s. The first thing you'll notice about the piece is that it's completely bereft of any sympathy for or even mention of the Palestinian people's plight. Sure, he writes of the ""mistreatment of Israeli Arabs"" i.e. Palestinians who survived the ethnic cleansing of their homeland being subjected to legalized and de facto discrimination. Dolgoff shows his ignorance when he contends that ""Israeli Arabs are entitled to the same legal rights as other Israeli citizens"". In actual fact there are, as documented by Adalah, over 50 state laws that discriminate against Palestinians, with many in effect at the time Dolgoff wrote his love letter to the Jewish State. Picking just one, the Land Administration Law (1960) allows the government to nominate members to a council that essentially determines land policy in the state. Half of the seats go to the government and the other half go to the Jewish National Fund, which collects money exclusively for the purchase of land for Israeli Jews. The ILA clearly then makes policy primarily for the benefit of Israel's Jewish citizens, a fact that has been recognized by the state's high court. Additionally, there's the denial of the RoR to Palestinian refugees and the extension of that same right to Jewish people all over the world.   Dolgoff's worst offense is his denial of Israel's original, immanent sin. He refers to the Arab World's perception of Israel as a settler-colonial state in scare quotes. He contends that the dismantling of the Israeli state would only ripen the land for ""Arab Conquest"", which is ironic because the state was created through the expulsion of over 700,000 Palestinians from their homeland.   The ""Anarcho-Zionist"" also refuses to acknowledge that Dolgoff's Azzam quote is only a fraction of what he actually said."
gulag,37xagt,autowikibot,2,Sun May 31 04:16:22 2015 UTC,"Sam Dolgoff:       Sam Dolgoff (1902–1990) was an American anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist.   Dolgoff was born in the shtetl of Ostrovno in Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire (in present-day Beshankovichy Raion, Belarus),  moving as a child to New York City in 1905 or 1906,  where he lived in the Bronx and in Manhattan's Lower East Side where he died. His father was a house painter, and Dolgoff began house painting at the age of 11, a profession he remained in his entire life.   After being expelled from the Young People's Socialist League, Sam joined the Industrial Workers of the World in the 1922  and remained an active member his entire life, playing an active role in the anarchist movement for much of the century. He was a co-founder of the Libertarian Labor Review magazine, which was later renamed Anarcho-Syndicalist Review to avoid confusion with America's Libertarian Party.  Dolgoff was a member of the Chicago Free Society Group in the 1920s, Vanguard Group member and editor of its publication Vanguard: A Journal of Libertarian Communism  in the 1930s, and co-founded the Libertarian League in New York in 1954.  He wrote articles for anarchist magazines as well as books as the editor of highly acclaimed anthologies, some of which are listed below. He was active in many causes, and attended groups like New York's Libertarian Book Club regularly.   Dolgoff, and his wife Esther, served as a link to anarchism's past to young anarchists of the 1960s and 1970s living in New York. He focused upon anarchism's (specifically anarcho-syndicalism's) roots in workers' movements and served as a moderating counterbalance to the punk-era anarchists who tended towards 'monkeywrenching' and confrontations with the police. Although Dolgoff was friends with Murray Bookchin, a notable anarchist theorist of the period, he was opposed to Bookchin's theory of Social Ecology, rooted as he was in the classical anarchist traditions of Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin.

I think that the ideologies behind these subs are absolutely revolting and I encourage you to learn about the far left. I usually wouldn't bother with someone who posts on /r/WhiteRights but from comments like ""LMAO Butthurt"" I assume that you're still fairly young so I think there's some hope for you. Visit /r/communism101, /r/anarchy101, and /r/socialism_101. /r/DebateCommunism is also good if you're wanting to, well, you know, debate. I don't care if you look at it from the perspective of trying to better understand your enemy or something like that as long as you try to learn about these ideas with an open mind. Also, if your school offers a course on Sociology, I recommend taking it. I think that learning basic Sociology could clear up any opinions you might have that are racist or sexist. Good luck, pal."

You aren't interested in why we would want to create a classless, stateless, moneyless society? I try to understand the mentality behind the far right. I spent an hour or so in /r/whiterights to challenge my own beliefs and figure out why people believe in such things. (Don't get me wrong though, I don't think I'm some sort of expert on the far right because I spent a small fraction of my day in a racist subreddit.) I consider Nazism and similar ideologies to be the most evil things out there (along with Twizlers. They're kind of the worst candy ever) so I think one of the best ways to fight it is to learn about it. Wouldn't you want to do the same? Hopefully, if you choose to read a bit about the left and basic sociology, you'll lose those beliefs that I consider so atrocious. Read as much as you can, pal. Read Nietzsche, Sartre, Marx, Plato, Tolstoy, and anyone else who's ever come up with an interesting idea.   By the way, what brought you to where you are now, if you don't mind me asking? Were you raised by white supremacists? Did you have a bad experience with a black person? Do you feel like Feminism threatens your masculinity? Do these ideas you've adopted make you feel empowered?

My family were farmers beforehand and my dad didn't see a car until he was a teenager. He was one of the many who got one of the jobs in the first factories in his region. If it wasn't for the opportunity that foreign investment brought he'd still be an illiterate farmer without access to nutritional food or modern medicine, which is too expensive for a rice farmer.   Colonialism in Iran was 17th century onwards brought on by the British and Reuters family and was very destructive, but this is a totally different to opening markets up to foreign investors"

[...]  We speak out to put the world on guard against what is happening in South Africa. The brutal policy of apartheid is applied before the eyes of the nations of the world. The peoples of Africa are compelled to endure the fact that on the African continent the superiority of one race over another remains official policy, and that in the name of this racial superiority murder is committed with impunity. Can the United Nations do nothing to stop this?  [...]  Those who kill their own children and discriminate daily against them because of the color of their skin; those who let the murderers of blacks remain free, protecting them, and furthermore punishing the black population because they demand their legitimate rights as free men — how can those who do this consider themselves guardians of freedom? The government of the United States is not the champion of freedom, but rather the perpetrator of exploitation and oppression against the peoples of the world and against a large part of its own population.   Che Guevara's 1964 UN speech. Oh, and he fought against imperialism in the Congo with Africans. Totes a racist."

And the two ancient races have now begun a hard life together, fraught with bickering and squabbles. Discrimination and poverty unite them in the daily fight for survival but their different ways of approaching life separate them completely: The black is indolent and a dreamer; spending his meager wage on frivolity or drink; the European has a tradition of work and saving, which has pursued him as far as this corner of America and drives him to advance himself, even independently of his own individual aspirations.""
