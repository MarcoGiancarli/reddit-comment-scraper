exmormon,3e2ygd,Measure76,13,Tue Jul 21 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"I can’t really argue with your first-hand example. I’ve also got several nieces and nephews who appear to be on the same trajectory. In addition, I firmly believe the lowering of the missionary age was the key thing that allowed Cook to make his claim in the last GC that the Church is stronger than ever, so I believe the Church is really counting on it to work.  However, I’m still reluctant to commit to saying outright that the Church’s age change is really working. The key thing is that my nieces and nephews still don’t seem to know any real details about the dirtier historical issues. Thus, the same things that caused me (and my family) to leave the Church are still just as lethal to them.  Factor in the growing number of exMormons (including exMormon family members like myself) that they’re going to come in contact with and I think you could make the argument that the age-lowering is a temporary fix at best and maybe gets the Church an extra 5 to 10 years so these kids who would have left at 18-20 just end up leaving at 25-35 like so many of us are currently doing.  EDIT to add one more thing. Also, among members I think there's a growing realization that missions aren't what they used to be. When I went I served foreign, had some cool experiences, got to live with the natives, people were generally nice even if not interested in the Church, etc. I was discussing the recent stateside mission call of one of my nieces with my uber-TBM sister (not the niece's mother) and gently suggested that maybe my niece shouldn't serve a mission and should instead continue with undergrad since the missionaries in my area all seem bored out of their skulls and aren't baptizing squat. I couldn't believe it when my TBM sister not only took the bait but replied that both she AND her RM husband agreed that a mission probably wasn't the best choice for this niece since she's a really smart girl and doing well in school, etc. Of course, this all breaks down when no one can say anything to her parents, but still..."

I spoke with my Bishop during my transition out of the Church and he was ""aware of the issues"" and claimed that he had also taught his kids about the issues. He had two kids (a son and a daughter) on missions at the same time. However, when I pushed him on polyandry and the definition of adultery he would just dodge the questions. I'd be willing to bet that his kids know nothing substantial about polyandry, much less the teenaged brides. I'm sure they just got some generalized ""Joseph was a polygamist, but we don't understand it all so we can't judge"" talk and that was it.  When these kids eventually find out that Joe married a bunch of teenaged brides and also practiced polyandry (aka committed adultery) they're still going to have some serious mental gymnastics to perform..."

exmormon,3e2ygd,shockednappalled,9,Tue Jul 21 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"It's hard to know.  Let's think about the reasons behind this change.    Keep missionary numbers high.  They most definitely have more women doing the missions now, and baby boomers are retiring which will push those numbers up even more.  The questions are if they're honestly reporting the numbers and what's the breakdown of the missionary population.  Keep members in the church.  They'll likely keep some young adults in that would have otherwise left.  Whether it's significant or not is unknown.  I don't remember hearing a spike to admissions at BYU, post surge, but I don't remember hearing about a drop either.  Money.  Since most of the new missionaries are in the US, that will help save some costs on travel; however, it's impossible to know how much each missionary was costing or gaining them.  Converts.  This is flat.  It turns out that more missions and missionaries aren't enough to keep new blood flowing into the religion.    So it's very likely that they have seen some success.  I just wonder how much, and whether it's something we'd agree with."

Once as he was delivering his wagon full of tithing to the bishops storehouse he noticed an old widow that had come by for a bit of welfare. Instead of giving his tithing to the bishop, my relative pulled his wagon next to the widow and began loading his goods into her wagon. The bishop came out and they got into a fight. Bishop said ""that's not we do things in this church.""  So my greats grandpa replied, ""then I want no part in it."" He drove home and told his wife and twelve kids, ""we're out of the church."" His oldest son is the only one that stayed active and that's where I come from. My parents used to share this as a cautionary tale to always pay a full and proper tithe.

exmormon,3e2pyx,getyourhairwet,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:58 2015 UTC,"I will readily admit most of my close male friends and co-workers are/have been secular military types. So of the interactions with Mormon males who spoke up about SAHP, I wasn't close to them, and they may have been talking out of their ass (like we all do occasionally). But I've gotten pretty much the same three responses from Mormon men when I ask ""if stay at home parenting is so great, why don't you do it?"" 1) overtly stating it's not their job. 2) something along the lines of ""I wouldn't want to take that from my wife, I just love her so much hibidyblooblah...."" 3) acknowledging a desire to be a stay at home dad but insinuating a fear that their manhood (or duties as father and husband) would be called into question.  So I do believe there are men who genuinely would be good at/want to be a stay at home parent. So it stands to reason there are also women who genuinely want to do that as well. But from my personal experience, those ""90%"" you speak of are lying.   Every single one of my close female Mormon friends (of which I've had many) have expressed some sort of depression at the prospect of staying at home with their children and putting their career on hold. They have all thought this was an indication they were broken, because older women in the church are professionals at hiding their genuine desires. But my mom hated staying home. And my gramma hated it. And I refuse to do it.   And an increasing amount of women are refusing to do it. Only people in Utah think my love of making money is special. Everyone outside the bubble is pretty well aware that furthering a career and being gainfully employed is a million times easier than spawning crotch goblins and taking care of mini psychos.   As a wise man once said: ""ah, Fester, I hope that someday you'll know the indescribable joy of having children, and of paying someone someone else to raise them."""

He doesn't know how to deal with this.  It's likely that he has a wife, mother, or sister who is a housewife.  He probably knows it is brutal for her and believes that everyone talking it up as the ""worlds best job"" makes it easier for people to do it.   Why are you so awkward around women in the workplace and can't treat them as professionals?   He likely has no experience in doing this.  Sometimes the women in the workplace have to train the men a little bit.     Why is your conscience okay with getting frisky with a woman on the fringes of the Church but you still expect an unsullied virgin as your trophy for being Zone Leader?   I don't think it is a matter of expectations.   The guy you are talking about sounds like a douche, but even still, he probably has sexual desires.  He probably sees this ""woman on the fringes"" as the most amazing thing he's ever seen.  He wants her.  He cares about her.  But he's been programmed and believes that she would be torn from him, so he'd rather find someone who he can be with for eternity.   But that doesn't mean he doesn't want to share the moments he can with her.   Why do you think Ordain Women is so damn funny?   Because their tactics are ill-advised and their leadership has been highly ineffective in doing anything more than antagonizing.   Sure, if antagonizing is the goal, they are good, but if change is the goal, they don't know what they are doing.     Why do you send strangers, women you've literally never met, ""concerned"" Facebook messages?   Because boundaries are a consequence of the veil.    Why is your wife so brainwashed that she has to write a Magna Carta-length message to a liberal Mormon acquaintance of hers about ""I, for one, feel blessed being separate but equal.""   Because her entire existence is threatened.  Because she probably wishes she could be more independent and equal, but she has bought into the idea of separate roles.   To her, a classic male and classic female sterotype create a more powerful chemical reaction (metaphorically speaking) than a more equal couple."

The idea of walking away once you graduate to the top of personal spiritual advancement was puzzling. After you are out it makes a lot more sense.  You are pressured into promises and asked to give consent with no time to process exactly what you are promising too. You participate in bizarre rituals.

About 8 years ago or so when he was working on it a lot he convinced a young family in our ward to help out with it. They were an early 30's couple with a few small children under 3 and if I recall correctly they were fairly new to the church having only converted within the previous five or ten years. I don't know what all exactly went on in the meetings they had besides lots of praying and supposedly talking with god himself in the basement living room. (Not sure how he could've shown up there anyway since I'm pretty sure I masturbated in there at least once). Anywho, there was a specific date that god told my dad that this device would turn on. The other couple came over, and they all went into the living room with the device but, of course, nothing happened at all.

exmormon,3e1d5j,Pinkfacemark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:11 2015 UTC,If you were married in the temple. You have to send a letter to break your sealing.

Tried to stop it in court but dads have little to no rights.

I believe that it is a handbook suggestion at the discretion of bishops, which any power-tripping Peter Priesthood would be tempted by. It is similar how to handbook suggestion that bishops should discern if rape victims ""share responsibility"" for their rape and whether they need to ""repent of the role they played"". Believe it or not, that is also common as dirt, a norm for women and girls who divulge sexual abuse and rape to their bishops. Bishop roulette, and the deeply ingrained patriarchal culture, are no small risk."

exmormon,3e1d5j,YoungModern,7,Tue Jul 21 14:55:56 2015 UTC,"~Healing the Tragic Scars of Abuse by Richard G Scott: ""The victim must do all in his or her power to stop the abuse... the Lord may prompt a victim to recognize a degree of responsibility for abuse. Your priesthood leader will help assess your responsibility so that, if needed, it can be addressed. Otherwise the seeds of guilt will remain and sprout into bitter fruit."" (This quote directly links feelings of guilt with actual guilt. In a discussion with a bishop, a victim may find a bishop simply suggesting or asking whether or not the victim feels that they have some repenting to do. Merely bringing this up would increase the likelihood that the victim comes to believe that they are at least partially responsible for the assault. The mere fact that a general authority espouses this view directly contributes to victim blaming.)  ~The Miracle of Forgiveness by Spencer W Kimball: ""Once given or taken or stolen it [virginity] can never be regained. Even in forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is absolutely no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle."" (This quote is filled with implication. The idea of being in a ""more favorable position"" for not participating in the sex act implies that a victim may still face eternal consequences, even if it isn't as bad as if she had consented. The last sentence in the passage is the most condemning, implying that if a victim is still alive, they must not have fought hard enough. The only thing missing to make this implication explicit is a simple ""however"" linking the sentence with the previous one. Even without the unsaid ""however,"" people still take this implication to heart, as exemplified by a Provo rape victim that told the Deseret Morning News that ""I should have died rather than let him do that to me."") To further exacerbate the problem, sex is oftentimes unclearly non-consensual, which is why it's so difficult to prosecute. Often times,especially if the victim knows their aggressor, the victim freezes up and has a hard time knowing what to do or how to react. Because of this, many people are raped without actually saying ""no."" Due to lack of opposition (you should have fought back!) the victim is often blamed, and in a bishop's interview, the bishop may not actually believe that the sex happened against her will, but that she was simply looking for a scapegoat to blame after making a bad decision."
exmormon,3e1d5j,YoungModern,3,Tue Jul 21 15:19:22 2015 UTC,It's not just hidden handbook stuff. The policy is actually still in Spencer W. Kimball's The Miracle of Forgiveness that they still give to missionaries.

exmormon,3e1d5j,mOutsider,6,Tue Jul 21 05:32:15 2015 UTC,"No, that is not correct.  If a woman wants to re-marry in the temple she requests a Cancellation of Sealing from the church leaders.  The Bishop will then contact the ex-husband and inquire as to if he has any issues or reasons as to why a cancellation should not be given.  No ""permission"" is needed, and regardless of the wishes of the ex-spouse, the church is going to do whatever it wants in the end.  Been there, done that.  Yeah. Really."

I think it makes sense for both parties to be informed and have a chance to respond. Neither has the final say. They reach out to the woman if the man is getting remarried or wants a cancellation as well.  As a woman I feel institutionally like the odds are against me with it being cancelled (I'm exmo, he's not) but I can see why it makes sense to reach out to the other spouse..UNLESS they were abusive. If they still need contact in that case that is fucked up."
exmormon,3e1d5j,brokebackmormon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:57 2015 UTC,"No, the Bishop is not contacting the ex for approval at all.    The ex is being contacted about any issues they might have concerning the divorce (particularly financial issues) that should prevent the ex-spouse from going through the temple.  If there are issues, the Bishop will make sure they are cleared up before the cancellation is granted and allowing the re-marriage in the temple.  There is no ""approval"" from the ex.  Unless there are outstanding issues, the temple re-marriage is going to happen no matter how the ex feels...approval or not."

exmormon,3e1d5j,ex-TBM,4,Tue Jul 21 11:18:37 2015 UTC,"To the OP, condolences if you are hurting, have some down time, be a little indulgent, pour your heart out to close friends, make big and positive life plans; congratulations on having the mental fortitude to make life altering life choices - your future self will look back on this time as positive or negative depending on what you now do. For what it's worth give Bishop his info, let ex have happiness in his life free from drama from you and don't obsess about little details and what-ifs, find something positive to focus on and let yourself naturally toughen up/heal over time until the memories hurt a lot less and bother you only infrequently.  Sorry I don't want to get on the 'he's a git' bandwagon.  Don't we value our freedom to choose? He's getting on with his life and didn't trap OP into a fractured marriage. Divorce is normally painful regardless of how it occurs - quick is surely a better overall scenario. I salute everyone who gets on with life. In all honesty , if you find someone to love and you have the means and the maturity why delay committing to each other? Life is too tenuous and fragile to always paddle in the shallows waiting for society's fickle permission to get surfing.  Bishop texting? Sounds fine to me. Do we really need outmoded communication methods such as formal letters? I'm all for rapid, quick and effectual discussion - get it over with as quick and neatly as possible. He has a life to get on with as well. I agree it would have been nicer to call OP but who knows , maybe he's a nervous guy, maybe ex suggested this is OPs favoured communication style , maybe he needs some evidence that he's asked etc.. IMO we shouldn't default to assuming bad motives. Most LDS members are pretty nice people."

exmormon,3e1d5j,unsafeatNESP,4,Tue Jul 21 13:01:16 2015 UTC,Did you officially resign? When my ex's bishop wrote me to get that information then I gave him a hard time because I had resigned. I asked him why my sealing was still on church records when I had asked to have my name removed from the church's records. It made for an interesting exchange.
exmormon,3e1d5j,kurinbo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:20 2015 UTC,Super curious about the outcome of that exchange. What happened?
exmormon,3e1d5j,steezeysteve,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:03 2015 UTC,It was great. I have to look at the letters again. I remember in my first one I threatened legal action because I had already resigned and had been assured that my name had been removed. I CC'ed my attorney on the letter. Bishop tried to back step and said something to the effect that my name had been removed but my ex's hadn't (no kidding-she left me because I refused to pretend to have magical powers). it went back and forth. It's hard for them if not impossiable for them to justify the need to cancel it when it doesn't exist after one party has resigned membership.
exmormon,3e1d5j,stevil501,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the update!  It kind of begs the question about what they mean by ""remove my name from the records of the Church."" Fine, your personal membership record is gone (we assume), but I'm pretty sure you were expecting your name to be wiped clean, I bet! They aren't a legal entity like the county. You can't expect the county or state to wipe out the fact that you were married to someone (it's a public record thing as I understand it), but I think you can totally expect your name to be removed from an ordinance in a belief system you no longer believe in."

However, I would like to express some concerns and shed some light as to why we divorced.  You see, my ex-husband loves to have anal sex.  Out of the 20 years we were married, he only made love to me the way nature intended twice.  All of the other times it was strictly anal.  He was the only man I had ever been with so I thought that was normal.  He began inviting men into the picture so we could have threesomes; however, the other man was more for him than for me.  He liked me to ""watch"" as he was pounded from behind.  I think it is prudent to warn his new fiance that he has both genital warts and herpes.  He never told me he had either of those things until after we were married and I began breaking out.  If there is anything else you need to know, feel free to ask anytime."

In other words, the first presidency AND quorum of the twelve need to endorse something in order for it to be ""officially binding.""  The kicker is that this publication itself doesn't meet the criteria. In other words, there is no officially binding definition on what constitutes official doctrine.

The children in the home placement program in Utah are often lighter than their brothers and sisters in the hogans on the reservation.... At one meeting a father and mother and their sixteen-year-old daughter were present, the little member girl-sixteen sitting between the dark father and mother, and it was evident she was several shades lighter than her parents on the same reservation, in the same Hogan, subject to the same sun and wind and weather. There was the doctor in a Utah city who for two years had had an Indian boy in his home who stated that he was some shades lighter than the younger brother just coming into the program from the reservation. These young members of the Church are changing to whiteness and delightsomeness.

His counselor went on to say how the church is attacked for its ""old-fashioned"" beliefs and gave a riveting speach on ""well you're darn right it's old fashioned, all the back through Christ's, to Adam and Even, and to the creation of the world!"" And a few other leaders were ready to fist pump out of their chairs in agreeance.   What's ironic is that the man in charge of the young men is a very humble and successful business man who is the president of a multimillion dollar company while the bishop and his councillors all work construction (typical small town momos) and I've heard the young men's pres complain multiple times about how poorly the Ward is run, but he always says ""but then I just have to remind myslef, it's not my place to say and I just work here."" So basically Joseph smith said two things that save them today, if you question your leaders you're being influenced by the devil and need to repent, and that in the last days men's hearts will fool them into leaving the church, so ""anti mormon"" literature (aka church history) should be avoided like the plague.

Moses recorded that one of the great-great-grandsons of Shem was named Peleg (a Hebrew word meaning division) because “in his days was the earth divided” (Genesis 10:25). Many scholars have passed this reference off as meaning some sort of cultural or political division, but modern prophets have taught that this statement should be taken literally.  An article published early in the history of the Church under the direction of the Prophet Joseph Smith stated: “The Eternal God hath declared that the great deep shall roll back into the north countries and that the land of Zion and the land of Jerusalem shall be joined together, as they were before they were divided in the days of Peleg. No wonder the mind starts at the sound of the last days!” (“The Last Days,” Evening and Morning Star, Feb. 1833, p. 1.) ... Though the time of this division of the land is placed much earlier by scientists than by the biblical chronology, the idea of one land mass is widely accepted.   https://www.lds.org/new-era/1971/03/gondwanaland-what-it-means-to-latter-day-saints?lang=eng"

Its something Mormons love to bring up as if non-Mormons will some how find this concept novel or enticing.   The Mormon doctrine that should be championed as being sort of unique is that families can be separated forever.    Its not like Jewish heaven forces you to forget all the relationships you had on earth.   You will still remember who your spouse was and who your kids were etc... and you will be able to socialize with them as much as you want.    What Mormons argue is that getting to heaven is not good enough.  You have to get to super VIP heaven and so does your family otherwise you will (in some magical way) be restricted from furthering your familial relationships in heaven.  Mormon God is a dick.    Lets say me and my spouse both land in terrestrial, whats to stop us from hanging out?  Does Mormon god erase our memory of each other?  Asshole.    Mormonism isn't about bringing families together its about holding those relationships hostage.   Either play the game or be doomed to a heaven where you are not allowed to socialize with your family."

Mortal beings could not endure the presence of the Father without the Spirit overshadowing them, and that was the mission of the Holy Ghost, but not to beget the Son of God, THAT WAS THE BUSINESS OF THE FATHER. Jesus Christ is the Only Begotten Son of God the Father in the flesh, and in holding to this doctrine President Brigham Young is in perfect accord with the teachings in the Bible.""   (Joseph Fielding Smith, Answers to Gospel Questions, vol. 5, p. 128).   ""When the Virgin Mary conceived the child Jesus, the Father had begotten him in his own likeness. He was not begotten by the Holy Ghost. And who is the Father? He is the first of the human family; and when he (Christ) took a tabernacle, it was begotten by his Father in Heaven, AFTER THE SAME MANNER as the tabernacles of Cain, Abel, and the rest of the sons and daughters of Adam and Eve. Jesus, our elder brother, was begotten in the flesh by the  Same character that was in the garden of Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven.""   (JoD 1:50-51, also ""Answers"", vol. 5, p. 121) stated by Brigham Young.   The birth of our Savior was as natural as are the births of our children; it was the result of NATURAL ACTION. He partook of FLESH AND BLOOD--was begotten of his father, as we were of our fathers.""    (JoD, vol. 8, p. 115).   ""Jesus Christ is the Son of Elohim both as spiritual and bodily OFFSPRING; that is to say, Elohim is LITERALLY the Father of the spirit of Jesus Christ and also of the BODY in which Jesus Christ performed his mission in the flesh...""   (as quoted from 'The Articles of Faith' by James E. Talmage, p. 466).   ""We are told in the scriptures that Jesus Christ is the only begotten son of God in the flesh....how are children begotten? I answer, just as Jesus was begotten of his Father. The Christian denominations believe that Christ was begotten not of God, but of the spirit that overshadowed his mother. THIS IS NONSENSE. Why will they not believe the Father when He says that Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten Son? Why will they try to EXPLAIN THIS TRUTH AWAY and make mystery of it?""    (as quoted from Joseph F. Smith, 'Box Elder Times,' Sep. 22, 1914).   When the time came that His first-born, the Saviour, should come into the world and take a tabernacle, the Father came himself and favored that Spirit with a tabernacle instead of letting any other man do it. The Saviour was begotten by the Father of His spirit, by the same being who is the Father of our spirits, AND THAT IS ALL THE ORGANIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JESUS CHRIST AND YOU AND ME.""    (as quoted from 'Discourses of Brigham Young,"" 1925 edition, p. 77).   The Holy Ghost came upon Mary, her conception was under that influence, even of the spirit of life; our Father in Heaven was the Father of the Son of Mary.....""    (as quoted from Joseph Fielding Smith, 'Man: His Origin and Destiny), p. 345.)   ""The fleshly body of Jesus required a Mother as well as a Father. Therefore, the Father and Mother of Jesus, according to the flesh, must have been associated in the capacity of husband and wife; hence the Virgin Mary must have been, for the time being, the lawful wife of God the Father: we use the term lawful wife, because it would be blasphemous in the highest degree to say that He overshadowed her or begat the Savior unlawfully........He had a lawful right to overshadow the Virgin Mary IN THE CAPACITY OF A HUSBAND, and beget a Son.......Whether God the Father gave Mary to Joseph for time only, or for time and eternity, we are not informed. It may be that He only gave her to be the wife of Joseph while in this mortal state, and that He intended after the resurrection to again take her as one of his own wives to raise up immortal spirits in eternity.""  Apostle Orson Pratt, ""The Seer,"" Oct. 1853, p. 158).  ""The man Joseph, the husband of Mary, did not, that we know of, have more than one wife, but Mary the wife of Joseph had another husband.""

exmormon,3dzswr,mick_dog,6,Tue Jul 21 13:17:45 2015 UTC,"Who the Great and Abominable Church is that Nephi is talking about that God shows to Nephi which is funny, because if there are only two churches, the church of the Lamb and the Great and Abominable church, it might be important to know which you are in.   Regarding your number 3, it's not official but Oaks recently made the Great and Abominable Church out to be secular atheistic humanism. Just read how he weasels around this one.   Book of Mormon prophecies describe the “great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil” This “church” is prophesied to have “dominion over all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people”. Called “most abominable above all other churches,” this church is also said to act “for the praise of the world” in bringing “the saints of God … down into captivity”.  Because no religious denomination—Christian or non-Christian—has ever had “dominion” over all nations of the earth or the potential to bring all the saints of God down into “captivity,” this great and abominable church must be something far more pervasive and widespread than a single “church,” as we understand that term today. It must be any philosophy or organization that opposes belief in God. And the “captivity” into which this “church” seeks to bring the saints will not be so much physical confinement as the captivity of false ideas.  Nephi was told by revelation that there were only “two churches”: “the church of the Lamb of God” and “the church of the devil”. This description suggests the contrast between those who believe in God and seek to serve Him according to their best understanding and those who reject the existence of God.  Other teachings in the Book of Mormon also use the word church to signify belief or nonbelief in God. The final chapters of 2 Nephi prophesy that in the last days the Gentiles will build up “many churches” that will “put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain”. They tell of “churches which are built up, and not unto the Lord”, which will “teach with their learning” and “deny the power of God”. They will “say unto the people: Hearken unto us, and hear ye our precept; for behold there is no God today”.  In the Savior’s ministry among the Nephites, He warned against a church that is not “built upon my gospel, [but] is built upon the works of men, or upon the works of the devil”. These warnings are not limited to religious organizations. In the circumstances of our day, they include a multitude of secular philosophies and activities.   [emphasis mine]   Why doesn't Oaks get the Q15 to fucking ask god what Nephi meant by ""church""? It seems to me his reasoning is more the philosophies of a man mingled with scripture than revelation."

exmormon,3e2fq0,SourLadybits,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:16 2015 UTC,"This is actually officially an entire branch of epistemology called fideism. Despite protestations to the contrary, LDS Mormonism is actually a fideistic tradition through and through. Fideism is essentially the religious form of post-modernism, and Richard Bushman is on the record as an adherent of post-modernism, specifically proclaiming himself to be post-modernist:   Belief and Evidence--an email from Richard Bushman (historian and author of Rough Stone Rolling) to a Presbyterian friend and student : latterdaysaints   [August 9, 2005]   Dear Quincy:  You question is not out of line with the [book] review of Believing History in Books and Culture. You are asking, as the earlier reviewer did, how can a reasonable historian ever pretend the events of the Book of Mormon were true? That's a fact of life for all Mormons all the time. They live with the realization that much of the world they believe to exist is nonsense to everyone else. It is disorienting for Mormons to live that way, and now I am discovering it is disorienting for non-Mormons who think they understand their Mormon friends but then realize they don't. There is some perplexing disjuncture in Mormon brains. As you say it is potentially a problem for any believing Christian, but is more sharply enunciated for Mormons. You must remember that within the walls of Mormonism all sorts of reasonable, functioning, educated people believe the Book of Mormon. That of course helps a Mormon to remain sane. It is also why many Mormons like myself have a post-modern turn to their minds. We, more than most others, recognize how socially constructed truth is. It really is what people agree to believe--or what methods of ascertaining truth they concur in. If you go inside the Mormon community, you find all sort of reasons for accepting the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon. It is not at all a one-sided case. One quite well-respected Mormon archeologist is now claiming there is actually more archeological evidence for the Book of Mormon than for the Old and New Testaments. That is a contested conclusion, of course, but it is not an empty claim.  So you see the fact is that Mormon intellectuals live in two worlds that touch and overlap and can converse but which are structured in quite different ways. I actually have rather complicated ways of thinking about the Book of Mormon, but they do come down to the belief that it is true. Personally I think that it is possible that Joseph's inspiration led him to interpret the ancient text for a modern audience, for that is what all prophets do. They explain old texts for new circumstances.  One reason [the book] Believing History is disorienting is that you and other non-Mormon readers were not the intended audience for the original essays. Virtually everything in the collection was written for Mormons. Some of the essays have pious endings. They were not meant to persuade non-believers to accept Mormon premises. They start with the premises Mormons accept and work on the implications. The book is not apologetics but explorations. My ideal reader would look on as an observer of the species Mormona. What are the folkways of their intellectuals? What concerns them? How do they deal with intellectual issues? The correct response is not acceptance or rejection but reflections on the peculiarities of Mormon thought.  I wish I could strike a responsive chord in Christians like you. Mormons wonder why all Christians don't understand that we believe in the Book of Mormon on the basis of a spiritual witness. It is very hard for a Mormon to believe that Christians accept the Bible because of the scholarly evidence confirming the historical accuracy of the work. Surely there are uneducated believers whose convictions are not rooted in academic knowledge. Isn't there some kind of human, existential truth that resonates with one's desires for goodness and divinity? And is that ultimately why we read the Bible as a devotional work? We don't have to read the latest issues of the [academic] journals to find out if the book is still true. We stick with it because we find God in its pages--or inspiration, or comfort, or scope. That is what religion is about in my opinion, and it is why I believe the Book of Mormon. I can't really evaluate all the scholarship all the time; while I am waiting for it to settle out, I have to go on living. I need some good to hold on to and to lift me up day by day. The Book of Mormon inspires me, and so I hold on.  Reason is too frail to base a life on. You can be whipped about by all the authorities with no genuine basis for deciding for yourself. I think it is far better to go where goodness lies.  I keep thinking other Christians are in a similar position, but they don't agree. They keep insisting their beliefs are based on reason and evidence. I can't buy that--the resurrection as rational fact? And so I am frankly as perplexed about Christian belief as you are about Mormons. Educated Christians claim to base their belief on reason when I thought faith was the teaching of the scriptures. You hear the Good Shepherd's voice, and you follow it.  I guess we could go on and on. I hope I am telling you the truth about myself. The fact is I am a believer and I can't help myself. I couldn't possibly give it up; it is too delicious.  Richard  [Richard Bushman, On the Road with Joseph Smith: An Author's Diary (Salt Lake City: Greg Kofford Books, 2007), pp. 15-16.]   Combine fideism with Divine Command Theory as well as Prosperity Theology, and you have the trifecta of Mormon epistemology, ethics, and theology."

exmormon,3e2fq0,HelperBot_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:06 2015 UTC,"This is something that many of my TBM friends have run into with me that they cannot get around, and give up pretty fast because they know it could get to them too when they try to get me back.  Logic disproves every religion.  None can stand up to it.  The only one that even comes close to being able to pass logic tests is Buddhism, because it's a spiritual practice and less an organized faith.  But logic isn't the point of religion or faith.  Logic is about testing for truth, right vs. wrong, and reality. Religion is about personal growth, development, emotional maturity as life goes forward.  Here's where the problem comes for me and the church.  Do I want to believe in and participate in an organization if I feel it is currently corrupt or hurting it's own members?  No, I do not.  So is the church corrupt or hurting it's members?   It excommunicates members based on politically popular prejudices.  From races, to interracial couples, and now by sexual orientations. It encourages its' member to feel betrayed by the ones that have been excommunicated, to the point where a former members own family will bully, harass, threaten and disown them. It forces family members to have a trial by faith for each other just to be part of their own family. It demands tithing from people who have little to give and still be able to live on, and gives little in return.  I have seen, first hand, the elderly being tithed on their Social Security incomes, and watched Bishops pound the guilt that the tithing must continue to be able to achieve salvation. It coaches missionaries to do anything it takes to get new members, including offering US citizenship in exchange for conversion.  But many who come here, find the local church members unwilling to fulfill their end of the bargain.  Making entire indentured servant communities of illegal immigrants with no way back to their own countries.  In a church intolerant of gays, it forces 14, 15, and 16 year old boys and girls to go into pornographic detail about their sexual thoughts, feelings, and actions, with men who are untrained in psychology and psychiatry, behind a solid, no-window, wood, usually locked door.   Members called by God to fulfill a roll in the church, if they turn out to be child molesters, are actively sheltered by the church, and their crimes hidden from police.  Leaving them in a position where they continue to abuse children, rather than admitting that the one receiving God's word, may have made a mistake. After taking tithing from the starving it uses that money to build multi-million dollar mansions for its' leaders, who then get to write off living in those mansions and the expenses for those mansions, in taxes.  It also builds multi-billion dollar for profit businesses, but takes in the money tax-free for being a registered religion.  Using money it publicly claims is supposed to be used for humanitarian uses only. It forces its' members to clean the church's properties, but also to work on its' farms in third-world countries without pay, as they are supposed to be volunteering.  Then sells the goods produced for a profit, without compensating the workers. It spends billions of dollars a year lobbying government's in free states and countries to alter the politics and laws of those places (including in the US) against the will of the wishes of the local populace, with money that it claims is supposed to be going to needy/starving families.  Then it claims persecution when anyone would try to pass laws to limit outside influence so the local populace may be governed how they wish. It does so much damage to the relationships of the loyal members to their fellow loyal members that active LDS members are the highest percent users of anti-depressants and anti-psychotics in both the United States, and the world.   So... Where do I begin to believe?  Joseph Smith was a prophet in the modern day.  And he bore witness to the restoration of the church in our time.  Only to have that church do all of this and more in the name of free money?  If our friendship is conditioned on believing in the church.  Ok, fine, I believe.  I believe in Kolob, and secret handshakes to get into Heaven.  But I don't believe the leadership are doing God's work.  Or are advising anyone to God's plan in any way.  I will not go to be indoctrinated to their ideals.  I will not contribute money to their goals.  I will not act to support their endangerment of children.  I will not participate in any monetarily supportive way.  I will not encourage others to participate, though if they just want to believe then good for them.  But at least I believe in God, Moroni, and how you get into the Celestial Kingdom.  Does that comfort you?"

He told me about how his mom would always call him and cry over the phone talking about how sad it made her and how she didn't understand. After years of this demonstration of motherly ""love"" he finally said to her(more or less in these words), ""I am truly sorry that this makes you sad, but you have to realize how you crying over me makes me feel. I am an adult, and hearing you dwell on your sadness for me undermines my ability to make my own decisions. It really makes me feel like you don't respect me. You being sad is your journey in life; I need to be able to live mine"". He told me that after he got the nerve up to say that, things have dramatically changed for the better. Unapologetically being who you are forces people to love and accept you rather than trying to change you. I don't know why, but after that conversation with him, I got on the computer that night and wrote my resignation letter. It was the first time I did something despite the horrendous(familial) consequence and also felt a sense of pride. I'm in the third decade of my life and that was the first time I felt like an adult. Do it. If you feel in your heart of hearts that it is the right thing to do, don't wait another minute to be who you are. Most of the inactive friends/family I know never felt the need to resign which is their own choice. For me, I needed to do it for my own good. My parents know where I stand, even though I haven't told them my name was removed, and it is still a relief to be who I am.

Something I struggle with, (and I think many of us struggle with,) is our want for someone to make decisions for us.  As members of the church we had many decisions made for us just because of our association with the plan of salvation.  Decisions that are normally made by reasoning individuals for example; when to date, where to get married, what to eat and drink, etc. were already made for us.  One of the things I have had to learn since leaving the church is that I alone am responsible for my decisions and their consequences.  Knowing this has been both liberating and scary, but also incredibly rewarding.  That being said, I don't think there is a correct answer to this question, other than what you decide, and for your own personal reasons.  Good Luck with your decision, I believe whatever you decide will be a good decision!"
exmormon,3e2k2k,Readbooks6,2,Tue Jul 21 14:16:48 2015 UTC,"I have posted in response to this question a few times.  Resignation from the church is a personal decision.  It is neither right nor wrong, it is just something you decide to do, or not to do.    Some people feel they need the resignation process to complete their journey.  For these individuals, the act of resigning helps bring them closure and a 'legal' distance from the church which allows them to move forward free from any lingering feelings of obligation or guilt.  It is a necessary and proper step forward for their personal spiritual journey.   Others, however, feel that the church has no right to dictate how you should separate.  They see the process of resignation and just one more hoop that the church is putting in front of them trying to dominate and control them.  They assume that once they stop attending meetings and paying dues, they are done, just like any other organization on the face of the earth.  They don't care that the church hunts them down, to 'rescue' them, because it gives them a chance to deliver an apostate response.  Also for some of these people not resigning also may maintain a certain degree of peace within their family relationships.    So you see, the decision is really yours to make.  Look to yourself and do what you think is best given your special and individual circumstances.  You will find support here, regardless of the path you choose."

If it isn't going to benefit you then it is okay to put off resigning until you feel the need to do so.   I resigned because I needed it. I had gone through years of inactivity and I needed to officially cut myself away from the church. I needed that separation and distinction. This is not like those other times. I'm really done for good. I did this without telling my parents or family. They probably would have had no idea if I didn't tell them.  When I was debating about telling them I was extremely concerned about how it would impact my mother. I knew she had been struggling with depression and I didn't want to lay another burden on her shoulders. I was very close to backing out and just keeping it a secret when a friend gave me great advice. You're not responsible for your mother's emotions. She might cry or be sad, but dealing with those emotions are her responsibility. You are responsible for your feelings and your end of those relationships. If keeping a secret and not being genuine is taking a toll on your family relationship and making you dread being around them you need to take responsibility from your end and change it. This means being honest and open about who you are and where you intend to go with your life. It is their responsibility to handle that news however they like. Do everything you can to support and love them and be ready to accept whatever they decide to do. Do what is best for you. When you are good and in an authentic place then you can start to worry about their emotions. You need to take care of yourself first."

If I go to a LDS sub and post temple videos I should expect to get banned. If someone can into my house and started insulting me I'd kick them out, thats essentially what happened to you.

When reading some of the ex-Mormon commiserating on this site, I often feel like shouting... ""who cares, Mormonism is just one little stream flowing into an ocean of false religious ideas."" However, I realized from my own experience how big a thing it is when one first discovers the facts about LDS Inc and makes the decision to leave. It's life changing and it's dramatic for a while, but after I put the God myth aside, it started feeling like it was hardly worth spending any more valuable effort going over and over Mormon problems. Once one identifies more as atheist or agnostic, there is no real reason to further pursue the LDS problem, except for fun, as an enjoyable pursuit, I suppose. No?"
exmormon,3dzr6z,sundancetao,15,Mon Jul 20 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"After she said that, I finally felt like I could read the ""God Delusion"" without having to hide it from her.  I had put it on the back burner because I thought that if she ever saw it, she would blow her lid that I was going from a TBM to atheist overnight.  I am 1/4 of the way in and dare I say I feel good when I read it.  Could that mean it is the Spirit testifying its truthfulness?  Haha."
exmormon,3dzr6z,codinja,12,Mon Jul 20 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"I kind of think TBM to atheist is a natural transition. That's what happened with me. When the only model of God I had was based on LDS specific teachings and that all came crashing down I was left with no idea of what a real God would actually be like. It was clear though that it isn't an interventionist God and that any God worth worshiping would have to be a logical and just God. I just don't see any evidence for such a being and if there is and he is logical and just then he wouldn't hold me accountable for not believing in him given the lack of evidence. In any other case, it's not a God I want to worship."
exmormon,3dzr6z,hblb229,3,Tue Jul 21 02:54:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely keep reading it. It helped me let go of a feeling of guilt for leaving religion, and allowed me to claim the title of atheist proudly, instead of being an apologetic agnostic after leaving the church."

exmormon,3dzr6z,MikeA64,2,Tue Jul 21 00:19:26 2015 UTC,"For me, traditional religion started becoming unbelievable. I really began to despise it. I was studying history, at the time, in college and I was thoroughly disgusted with all the things that religion had perpetuated onto society and individuals. I read this article http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2008/05/10-reasons-you-should-never-have-a-religion/ and I loved what it said. I was a restless TBM at the time of reading it. It both offended me and made sense to me. BUT the thing that kept me ""caged in"" was that I argued in my mind that this Steve Pavlina guy, and others like him, were not Mormon and they did not KNOW about the restored church...like I did.  I wanted to break out, but still felt trapped. (I wanted to become a fulltime RVer so I wouldn't have to go to church again). My ""hanging on"" only lasted a few more months. That's about the time I stumbled onto a link to MormonStories.org from a mainstream news article. Was shocked at what I learned, BUT I was on my way to freedom!!"
exmormon,3dzr6z,QuillsInInk,9,Tue Jul 21 05:51:18 2015 UTC,"One of the best parts of coming out of Mormonism for me was my renewed determination to enjoy every bit of the life I'm living instead of the mindset of ""oh well, maybe in the next life."" I've had so many wonderful new experiences as a result. It's amazing what it's like to live a life without fear."

I know things were like that back then, but instead of feeling the nail prints in his hands, we are even witnessier of Christ because we can feel the spirit.

exmormon,3e157e,jdovew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:55:01 2015 UTC,"Because the confirmation of the Spirit is even stronger than actually seeing him.

exmormon,3e157e,Unmormon1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:19:15 2015 UTC,"And even without that direct definition, it's common sense that a special witness needs to be a witness of something special.

If this ringing endorsement of the power of revelation flowing directly from God to his Prophet doesn't lead you back to the LDS church, then I don't know what will. ;)  From this interview: http://www.abc.net.au/compass/intervs/hinckley.htm  RB: As the world leader of the the Church, how are you in touch with God? Can you explain that for me?  GBH: I pray. I pray to Him. Night and morning. I speak with Him. I think He hears my prayers. As He hears the prayers of others. I think He answers them.  RB: But more than that, because you’re leader of the Church. Do you have a special connection?  GBH: I have a special relationship in terms of the Church as an institution. Yes.  RB: And you receive........  GBH: For the entire Church.  RB: You receive?  GBH: Now we don’t need a lot of continuing revelation. We have a great, basic reservoir of revelation. But if a problem arises, as it does occasionally, a vexatious thing with which we have to deal, we go to the Lord in prayer. We discuss it as a First Presidency and as a Council of the Twelve Apostles. We pray about it and then comes the whisperings of a still small voice. And we know the direction we should take and we proceed accordingly.  RB: And this is a Revelation?  GBH: This is a Revelation.  RB: How often have you received such revelations?  GBH: Oh, I don’t know. I feel satisfied that in some circumstances we’ve had such revelation. It’s a very sacred thing that we don’t like to talk about a lot. A very sacred thing.  Q: But it’s a special experience?  GBH: I think it’s a real thing. It’s a very real thing. And a special experience."

It only makes sense if your goal in life is to have absolutely as many as biologically possible. A normal family of 1-3 children should be doable by most healthy women even if they start in their late 20's/ early 30's.   And if you're extremely healthy even a little later. I had a professor who didn't have children until her late 30's. Her extremely good health paid off and she was able to have two perfect pregnancies.

If you're really concerned about your family being contacted, I think chubs offered to send the letter on his legal letterhead. Make sure you ok it with first.  Be forewarned, eventually your parents will go to tithing settlement, and your name will be absent from a list of the living members they are sealed to. If they bother to look, you will be revealed this way. Also, if they ask the ward clerk to move your records to your local ward, and the clerk tells them that your records are inaccessible, then the jig will be up. This can also happen if they are trying to look at your account on whatever wonky LDS member site they have nowadays and your account has been shutdown. Hopefully you'll have some time. They might notice soon, it might be years before they notice. Roll of the dice. My advice is to say nothing.

exmormon,3e3efl,TheWayoftheFuture,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"There was one time where I went camping with my dad, and, looking back I think it was supposed to be a ""father-son"" type deal, but Dad doesn't give a shit and brought me anyway.   So I went exploring with the boys as it was getting dark, we found a short, manmade tunnel, and then continued to bicker about who should go on first. I decided to run through it with one of the boys (this would have been about 11 or 12, and they were giving me shit about being a girl so I had to do the manly thing you know.)   Have you ever fled from a nest of disturbed bats? Because I have. Also, only one of us cried, and it wasn't me."
exmormon,3e3efl,mahatmaj,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:03 2015 UTC,"I asked this question because I wanted an excuse to tell a story.   When I was 16, for a combined activity, we went to a minor league baseball game (the now defunct Tucson Toros, if anyone is wondering).  All the YM and YW leaders were there, as well as a member in the ward who was on the stake high council. We were all sitting in the stands enjoying the game and as the game wore on, we being sometimes silly YM, talk started to turn to shenanigans.   I forget what first started it, but at some point someone either dared me or I said I should run out onto the field. Of course, all the YM were quick to encourage me with all the enthusiasm of a Shia Lebouf motivational video.   Being at least a little savvy, I wasn't going to do it for nothing and said I needed some money out of the deal. Us YM were pretty much broke, so we turned to the leaders there with us. ""Hey, will you give TheWayoftheFuture money if he runs out onto the field?""  Shockingly, all the leaders were on board with it. They thought it was funny and offered to sweeten the pot. I'm sure they thought I'd never actually go through with it. You all see where this is going.   Once the YM leaders, and a member of the stake high council all were aware of it and said they'd donate money to the cause, I realized there was no way I could get into much trouble. They all knew! I'm sure they thought I was joking, but they all knew, laughed, said ""go for it,"" and not one single leader said a word to discourage me.   This gave me all the ""I'll show you not to take me seriously"" motivation 16 year old me needed.  At the start of the ninth inning, I walked down to a spot on the first base line where the field was separated by a short gate. There was a little bit of fan traffic in this area so I had a little bit of cover. I had to stand there for a minute or two waiting for the right opportunity (I didn't want to disrupt a play, I had my standards). Even as I stood there with some of the other YM who wanted a front row view of the action, not one of the leaders said a thing to discourage me.   And so it was, after the first out of the ninth inning, I took off my shirt, hopped the gate, ran between home and first base, then between first and second base as I made my way to center field, swinging my shirt in circles above my head.  I expected security to be hot on my tail as soon as I hit the field. When I got into center field, I stopped, turned around and there was no one chasing me. I shrugged my shoulders as if to say, ""where is everybody?""  While security was getting their act together, The center fielder tried to help me out. He tried to tell me the best escape route but I didn't really catch what he was saying. Not knowing what else to do (I didn't think that far ahead), I ran and hopped another gate deep in right field to get off the field and started walking back toward where we were all seated.   By this time, security was organized enough to come after me, and a slightly panicked security guard approached me telling me to stop and put my hands against the wall. I did. I was handcuffed and taken to the security office where they stuck me in some boiler room type place where I sat for the rest of the game. I told them I was there with a church group and gave them the name of the YM president so someone could come get me.   When the game was over, the YM pres came and got me. He was in disbelief that I actually did it, but he knew he couldn't say anything because he was one of the ones that said he'd pay me if I did it!  When my parents found out, they were upset, but I wasn't punished severely. They made me write a letter explaining why I did what I did and that was it.   A few days later, I went to another Toros game with some friends who hoped to convince me to do it again. I intentionally wore the exact same clothes to the game and I saw the same security that cuffed me a few days earlier. He told me, ""you better not do that again"" and I said I wouldn't. I didn't.  A month or so later, my parents and I were walking into a high school football game and the guy from the stake high council who was at the game happened to be walking in as well. He said to me, ""I can't believe you did that at the baseball game. Why did you do that?""  I said, ""Why didn't you pay me like you said you would."" My parents laughed. He knew he was busted. He took out his wallet and paid me. I appreciated that."

It's sad. It made me stop trusting my family so much because I needed more help not less. I'm sorry that your parents treated you like that, and really glad that you finally received help."
exmormon,3dz7dp,GeorgePWashburn,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:19 2015 UTC,Your kids (and you) being exmo atheists is totally different than your kids being atheists. There is a reason why this sub exists sadly. The exmo part leaves a residue no matter how much you try to wash it off. It's certainly nothing to be minimized. It's hard enough for grown adults to work through. The impact on kids is that much greater.

exmormon,3dz7dp,AnotherClosetAtheist,15,Mon Jul 20 19:06:52 2015 UTC,It's easy to say that but there's a lot in life to make a kid apprehensive.  American politics and government are corrupt and unresponsive to citizens' needs.  Global warming and the coming scarcity of resources including potable water could make anyone dread the future.  Terrorism abroad and mass murder mayhem domestically have to make you sick to your stomach.  The us v them Balkanization of our society offers little encouragement.    If the number of suicides is actually increasing someone should be looking for some hard answers.  And just assuming it's about religion doesn't seem very productive.
exmormon,3dz7dp,GeorgePWashburn,42,Mon Jul 20 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"American politics and government are corrupt and unresponsive to citizens' needs.   The teachings of Mormonism since 1950 are completely non-religious, and are 100% based on anti-Communist rhetoric.  Examples: Masturbation, empowered women, homosexuality, birth control, and abortion are bad because they lead to consequence-free sexual satisfaction, which leads to a lower birthrate, which leads to a lowered war-readiness against Russia. We must create societal pressures to shame and criminalize all of these things. The leaders of religions should label these as the core evils of the 20th century. These are tools of Communist spies to eventually win a land war, and religions should emphasize the notion that Russia is godless, and wants to make America godless too.  Modern American religion has been corrupted to the same level as our two-party system. Religions DO NOT HELP anyone anymore. They are anti-charity because charity is communism."

But I just don't see a 13 year old kid killing themselves because they are depressed about a future where peak oil has been hit and American politicians are still failing to embrace renewable energy before all of our jobs are automated away and a universal basic income has yet to be instituted."
exmormon,3dz7dp,too_much_to_do,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:57 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I have non-Mormon kids.  My daughter was deeply concerned about the kind of future she had to face 15 years ago.  And it was hard for me, then, to deny the issues she used to bring up.    It's only gotten more stark.  And, frankly, at 68 I'm actually grateful I will miss the worst of it while it sickens me that my grandson will live in a world seriously impacted and compromised by these things.  I am not saying that the constant pressure to be some kind of unachievable Mormon perfection doesn't depress the living crap out of these kids.  I'm not saying that constant messages about normal libidos and sexuality being dangerous and non-hetero-normative sex being ""worse than death"" can't drive a kid around the bend.  I'm just saying that when suicide becomes something more common there's much more going on.  There was a time in around the 70s when the number of teen suicides increased alarmingly in the Northeast.  That was in New England somewhere where the Mormon populations low.  That turned out to be a rather twisted ""fashion"" where depressed kids were making pacts with one another and getting into the whole goth drama of it.  And I think if you check you'll see a spike in the stats on suicides after Kurt Cobain killed himself.    Again, Mormon kids may have more unique motives that come from church messages but they may also have other non-church reasons too.  And when it looks like a group phenomenon it's time to look at those non-church ones."
exmormon,3dz7dp,kogware,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:33:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, just the list of reasons you gave earlier.   Generally, even with adults, the reasons people commit suicide are much simpler. They either have a mental illness (anxiety, bipolar, etc.), they've been abused, bullied, addicted to drugs, become nihilistic, or they're lonely/can't make friends. This is course far from an exhaustive list but is pretty different from what was listed before.    It's only gotten more stark. And, frankly, at 68 I'm actually grateful I will miss the worst of it...   To me this sounds like the same 'ole doom and gloom preached from the pulpit. The reality is literally the exact opposite. More people than ever are having their civil rights recognized. Women are more and more becoming empowered to run their own lives. Violent crime has been declining for decades. Sure there are still problems to be solved but there will always be a new problem and humanity will solve them as they come. Sometimes more slowly than we need to but they do get solved.  http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2014/12/the_world_is_not_falling_apart_the_trend_lines_reveal_an_increasingly_peaceful.html"

I was convinced God hated me because I never felt the Spirit, I never received a confirmation that the BoM was true no matter how many times I read it and prayed, and I always felt like I could never be spiritual enough.

exmormon,3e1rji,romulusjsp,5,Tue Jul 21 08:03:02 2015 UTC,"My tips would be drink at home the first couple times.  You won't have to drive anywhere and won't have to apologize to anyone the next day.    Eat a healthy meal so you have food in your stomach.    Then try something you think you would like.  Bloody Marys, Screwdrivers, Rum and Cokes, and Gin and Tonics are all easy to mix up yourself.  It's possible you could find some 3.2 beer.  Hard cider can be good but, for gods sake, get something good not those fruit punchy things marketed to kids!   A shot of Kailua in a cup of coffee (if you're drinking coffee too) is nice and easy and a delightful finish to a good meal.    The little airline-sized bottles that some liquor stores sell are the equivalent of a standard bar serving.  Start with just half a bottle or less.  You can build up your tolerance before you go out and drink socially.  Those little bottles are also a relatively inexpensive way to sample a lot of stuff to see what you like best.    Buy good stuff.  Cheap stuff has a lot of the impurities that make the liquor harsher and increase the likelihood of a headache later.  Finally, make sure you also drink plenty of water so you don't get dehydrated.  That's also the invitation to a nasty headache.  Good luck and have fun with it.  Oh!  I forgot.  A martini is also very easy to mix up and if you make your own chocolate vodka you can make a very tasty one!   Just make half that chocolate vodka recipe because the cocoa fat will separate out of what you don't use quickly and it's so easy to mix up a fresh batch anytime you want it."

I have a friend who left a few years ago who's going to provide my first introduction soon. He recommended just starting easy with some beer. Also, he recommended making sure you have a sober friend around because you don't know your limits when you're first starting and it's different for everyone. Anyway, it's probably best to avoid getting too drunk and just start with something light."
exmormon,3e1rji,codinja,2,Tue Jul 21 08:13:26 2015 UTC,I can't imagine a worse start than beer or wine... It's TERRIBLE if you've not grown accustomed to it.

exmormon,3e1rji,codinja,2,Tue Jul 21 09:14:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I started testing the alcohol waters about 3 years ago, and the friend I was with knew it wouldn't be great, but we tried a lot of beers and wines. Any vast majority of them were so bitter that I could clbarely swallow. I mean... You've never tasted anything this bitter.... So knowing I was a wuss she had me try a riesling wine, which was much sweeter and delicious.  So, maybe a sweet riesling wine if you must have wine.   Now, the real good stuff is in the mixed drinks. My favorite is the White Russian. I don't know many more, but if you google around I'm sure other beginner drinks are out there. Just saying... If you try something and it's horrible, don't give up."
exmormon,3e1rji,tender_mercies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:31 2015 UTC,"Have friends that know what they are doing. Otherwise, I can't think of a reason to even start, unless you hope to hang at bars and meet new people that way? After you've had a few at home to get a feel for it, then go out with friends or if you have none, Uber somewhere that looks social and have a good time.   Rum + Coke will be your easiest way to get into the scene.   For beer, something like Shock Top/Blue Moon or even a cider will be a palatable introduction."
exmormon,3e1rji,Mr_Slugworth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:30:32 2015 UTC,"Go with a non-drinking friend to a wine tasting at your local wine store or a trader joe's or something.  Or, find a spot that offers beer flights, ideally a brewery and go with a non-drinking friend.  I found trying drinks at home was disappointing as I didn't know what I was doing and nothing turned out very well.  Go with a friend and order something you think you'd enjoy (daiquiri, bloody mary, rum and coke).  Start with a half drink or 1 drink at most.  Be sure to eat and drink water.  If you are wanting to experience getting drunk do that at home with someone you trust and prepare yourself for regret."

exmormon,3e0qzf,theoriginalharbinger,4,Tue Jul 21 13:37:25 2015 UTC,"Playing devil's advocate here...  LDS member / non-member status determines tuition rates while at the Y as well as eligibility for continued attendance. So, in order to have the system not bar people from enrollment (or, alternately, charging them a higher tuition rate) by dint of changing their religion, they made the field inalterable. They probably knew people would try to change it and didn't want to deal with the influx of calls that would result.  I'd also add that BYU has never withheld transcripts from anybody based on membership status. Both my wife and I are ex-Mormon with official resignations in hand, and have no issue obtaining transcripts. The transcript office is not hooked into the membership recordkeeping system, so there's really no way for them to keep you from requesting transcripts whether you're a current member or not."
exmormon,3e0qzf,kurinbo,7,Tue Jul 21 04:05:47 2015 UTC,"The transcript problem only occurs if you quit (or get kicked out of) TSCC while enrolled at BYU.

exmormon,3e0qzf,theoriginalharbinger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:55:03 2015 UTC,"Not correct.  Changing religion will make you unable to get an ecclesiastical endorsement, but it's not an honor code violation and will not get a hold put on your transcript. The two cases commonly cited (Chad Hardy, one other one whose name eludes me) had this happen; neither had problems with getting transcripts, but could not graduate due to lack of EE.  So it's still a bad idea if you plan to continue attending BYU, but religion changes whether currently attending or not will not prevent you from acquiring transcripts."

Everyone in the parking lot watched as the metal against metal made that sound that it does and she apparently couldn't hear it.

When I was in my reconciliation mode with the church one of the things they were adamant about was that I not hang out with ANYONE that was gay or part of my ""past life"". They wanted to insulated me from everything that non-church related or approved. The argument was to ""avoid temptation"", but this included friends that were straight but part of my old group of friends at the time.   So in reality it was a control issue.      Lucky I came to my senses."

exmormon,3dzx7z,thisisnotpete,7,Tue Jul 21 00:31:16 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that at least some parts of this are true, as I've heard Tom C, the apostles brother, personally relate it in various Affirmation (a gay lds group) talks he has given and in facebook groups which I and he are part of.  What bothers me most is that Tom would care more about his ""family"" of TBM's than his long time partner.  I wonder what in the world is Tom's motivation.  Maybe he's too old to get it up any more, I don't know?"
exmormon,3dzx7z,kevinrex,4,Mon Jul 20 22:32:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, the parts I know to be true from the mouth of Tom, that he was excommunicated as a younger man because of his very sexually active lifestyle amongst the gay community, and that he has been rebaptized and gave up living with his partner, and that he has not received his temple blessings (definitely a so-called needs to be before that one) back yet."
exmormon,3dzx7z,kevinrex,2,Mon Jul 20 22:34:33 2015 UTC,"so my understanding is that he is trying to get temple blessings while still being close with his former partner. so it seems to me he is valuing that relationship more than his family or the chuch. which sounds healthy to me, but also could force the church's hand."
exmormon,3dzx7z,kevinrex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:56:03 2015 UTC,"That's good, and I suppose Tom has a very difficult balancing act with it.  To me, it seemed that he was turning away from his partner.  I don't understand at all why he is doing any of this, but maybe he's feeling lonely in his old age; I don't know."
exmormon,3dzx7z,patriarchybasher,6,Tue Jul 21 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"The part about him being gay and having a long-term partner, getting ex'd as a young man and being rebaptized a year or so ago is definitely true and it is public information.  The part about Todd C. being behind the mormonsandgay website and urging love toward gays is consistent with Todd C.'s public statements, including public statements about how his family was always loving toward Tom.   I have seen semi-public (FB places where there are lots and lots of people) indicating that Tom moved (but not indicating where he moved). My impression was that he moved away from his partner.  No idea where he moved.  Also have seen FB indications that he is doing stuff with North Star, which is a group that ""helps"" Mormon gays stay true to Mormon standards.  He was recently at a North Star event in Salt Lake, but I don't know whether that means he has moved there.  I don't know what else of the OP's post is accurate, but I share the OP's concern that if the church is making an apostle's brother completely distance himself from his partner in order to have his temple blessings restored, it indicates a very deliberate doubling down on its stand that the only worthy gay is a celibate gay who distances him/herself from all emotional attachments. I find that unhealthy and cruel in the extreme.  Ever since I learned of Tom's rebaptism I have thought it tragic that the church broke up his lifetime commitment and relationship to the man with whom he has, from all appearances, shared a happy and loving life.  I have hoped that he cut some kind of deal with his brother to make things better for other Mormon gay people; instead this looks like a sellout, coerced by the church, that will make things worse for gay people, not better, as Tom's great sacrifice will be held up as the unassailable standard for all gay people.    If what the OP says is true, this is one more evidence that the Mormon church is evil."

Especially since he isn't living by the standard, but still being held up as the bastion we would all Strive for.  He is a collaborator in my opinion and should be shunned from the gay community."
exmormon,3dzx7z,DysgrntVeteran,3,Tue Jul 21 03:56:29 2015 UTC,I agree that most people deserve a private life. But there are times when individuals take it upon themselves to speak publicly and become advocates for a particular cause and in doing so they become public figures with less right to the privacy that they've willingly given up. Tom Christofferson has allowed himself to be placed in this position by speaking publicly about his personally life and thus having a great deal of influence over young gay men and women.  What makes me doubt this story is that I also recall him living in CT and that he'd never been to the temple.  My question would be if he has indeed broken up with his partner and if doing so was directly related to his desire to return to the church. Or did he and his partner separate thus leaving him lonely and turning to the church of his childhood?  There's a huge difference between an old dude like Tom deciding to remain celibate after a long life of wild oat sewing and a young teen or young adult being told to never have sex or show affection. I wrote about that here  https://dadsprimalscream.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/prodigal-brother-syndrome/

There is zero testimony in that, he's not claiming to have witnessed anything.  If he actually claimed to have met christ, spoken with him, then that is a legitimate claim. We might not believe him, but it would at least be a step closer to what many members used to believe the requirement was to be an apostle.   All his talk shows is how vacuous his 'witness' is."

I don't. He can save you. I can't. I can report on the glory of this Lord of ours but only He can dispense it. Of that I bear testimony intending to be held to account for the testimony I bear.  I have spoken with Him as a man speaks to another. He speaks in plain humility, reasoning as one man with another. He will reason with you.  I've seen the Father and I've seen the Son, and they both have spoken with me. The only reason I mentioned that is to give you confidence that it can happen. It should happen to you.  If I can help you better envision our Lord, let me describe His characteristics. Our Lord was and is, affable, but He is not gregarious. He was approachable, and He is approachable and is not aloof. He is patient. He is willing to guide and He is willing to teach. He is intelligent but  He is not overbearing. He is humble in His demeanor, even though His power is undeniable. He is therefore, both a Lamb and a Lion.  When the Lord first spoke to me, He expounded the scriptures about the Restoration.  I am keenly aware of my own limitations. But I am also keenly aware of our Lord. When I have had discussions with Him, they have invariably involved parsing through the scriptures and Him explaining things to me. When I have inquired and gotten answers, it is because there are things in the scriptures I did not understand. I bear witness of Christ. I have seen Him! I know He lives!   These statements were made by Denver Snuffer during his somewhat recent lecture circuit.  Legitimate or not I sure wish the LDS leaders spoke this way."

I know the feelings I'm having, that everyone has, are special because the group taught me that they mean that the group was right.  He went on a mission.  He may know more than me about church history, but I know how I feel.   He never really felt the same way I feel, and he was never in the church as much as I am.  I loved my husband, and I didn't marry him because of the church (but I wouldn't have married him if he wasn't in the church or returned from his mission dishonorably or doubting or otherwise unfaithful in his callings).  I'm sure he believes he's right.  He's just wrong.  I don't have all the answers now, and I can't prove that he's wrong; however, I will when I die.  I'm praying for him, and I'm trying to convince him to spend time with my friends that I'm to do things with (all members, even if I pretend I have a neighbor who is a friend and is not).

exmormon,3dyp9c,portiaofbelmont,4,Tue Jul 21 03:58:38 2015 UTC,"But you already know that she can't show you how you're wrong, or help you resolve your concerns. So you're not really asking her that.   What you're really doing is asking her to expose herself to things that will more than likely obliterate her testimony, which she clearly realizes because that what happened for you. And that is literally against what she believes, because it's been instructed from the pulpit to avoid ""anti-mormon"" material.  Continuing to believe in the church may be what she wants to do and what makes her happy. Lots of people stay in the church even though that know there are issues. They choose not to research it because it's not important to them. They do this because they are happy with their lives. My mom is one of them. Maybe your wife is too.   Seeing her as taking a back seat, bowing her head and saying yes for the rest of her life is a dangerous attitude for you to take towards her. It's very condescending."
exmormon,3dyp9c,deterministic_guy,6,Tue Jul 21 04:14:53 2015 UTC,"Can testify to the truth of this.  My Wife has listened while I've told her the entire story of the BoA, and it still hasn't gotten her to even open up so much as a webpage on the subject.  Same reaction after I told her of my concerns about Joe Smith & Brigham Young.  She listens, but the information just doesn't seem to ever gain any traction.  It doesn't peak her curiosity, bc she is happy where she is and doesn't want that happiness to change.  Her entire family are active Mormon's and I don't think she wants to stray and become a possible black sheep.  I think she enjoys all of the social aspects of church and the community it provides.    And personally, her continued faith doesn't harm me in any way.  Sure, it's frustrating as hell sometimes, especially when I find out something crazy about the church and have no one but the fine people of this sub to share it with.  The tithing aspect also drives me up the wall at times, but overall, she is probably where she should be, in the situation that brings her the most happiness.  And really, as husbands and wives, isn't that what we should ultimately want for our significant others?  For them to be happy?"

Your OP sounds like you basically want your wife to switch from obeying the church, to obeying you. Reading through the comments, maybe your OP comes off in a way you didn't intend.   But I will say this... You've been where she is now. Try to understand where she is coming from, even when you feel like she's not doing that for you. She has, after all, been trained all her life to run fast and far from anything that might threaten her testimony. That's tough to undo. Not to mention if you have kids, the ingrained duty to teach them the gospel. I still struggle with that one even though I wave my atheist flag pretty proudly at this point.  I was lucky in that my spouse followed me out, but for a case like yours and so many others, I feel like the only way to get to the other side (whether the ""other side"" is both of you leaving the church or her staying and you find a workable compromise) with your marriage intact is to first and foremost maintain respect for your spouse.   Resist the urge to even think negative thoughts about your wife because that will only breed resentment. I've learned this going through different issues with my own marriage. When I allowed myself to fester and stew, I felt like I couldn't take one more day and I was on the brink of leaving. It's like I used up all my emotional energy in my own brain before he even got a chance to walk through the door. When I purposefully resisted the temptation, and tried to see things from his point of view, I felt like I could find a way to make it work.   I can see the frustration in your words. I hope it works out for you for the best."

She doesn't know he is deceived, but she doesn't know he is right either.  If she is happy with her faith and feels like she is on the right path, listening to a laundry list of attacks is all risk with no reward, in her eyes.   Have you asked him why he doesn't believe the church is true?   Again, you used to believe, so why are you suddenly more credible now.  You've given up and changed course.  You want to use things you found to create dissonance between what she knows in her heart and what you think you know because of what you've read.    To her, your method of discovery is no more valid than hers, so why create the conflict?   Did your husband serve a mission? Did you? Is it fair to say he's spent more of his life dedicated to the church than you have?   In the Church, we don't believe that one is converted by the amount of time they spend in the Church.  True conversion comes from the spirit, which she may have more access to than you.   When you married your husband, did you want to be married to a leader? Did you want someone that would choose the right, even if it wasn't popular?   You are essentially saying that you are better at making choices than your wife is.  You are saying that your path is more valid than hers.   Is it possible he's doing what he believes is right (by leaving the church)?   Sure, but that doesn't mean he is right.

In my 20s, I gather facts that were out there of which I was previously unaware. Now I'll take an Infinity G38 over the now defunct Saturn any day.  Why is a 15th year partner at a law firm more credible than a second year associate?   She doesn't know he is deceived,   EASY:  Yes, she does - she explicitly tells him so.   Again, you used to believe, so why are you suddenly more credible now.   See above   You've given up and changed course   No, TBM wife, I'm doggedly committed to finding and following the truth; as much or even more so than when we met. I have not changed course, and my proof is that I'm willing to turn from the religion of my childhood, of my family, and of my friends to get that truth.   You want to use things you found to create dissonance between what she knows in her heart and what you think you know because of what you've read. To her, your method of discovery is no more valid than hers, so why create the conflict?   No conflict in testing truth. If it's true, it can't be harmed by investigation...no? There is no problem if she says, ""OK, let me see what you're reading. Let me investigate it, poke it, prod it, and test it."" If she does that and can explain why it still makes sense, why a burning in the heart coupled with knowledge still leads her down her path, how can you not respect that? But that's not what happens in so many cases. Instead, its, I had a burning in my heart, which no one outside of Mormonism has ever had (or if they did THEY were deceived), so I don't need to read what you've read.   In the Church, we don't believe that one is converted by the amount of time they spend in the Church. True conversion comes from the spirit, which she may have more access to than you.   You are ignoring the fact that more time spent in church service, if your heart is in the right place, provides more opportunity for greater dedication and spiritual witness. Most people who spend two years COMPLETELY dedicated to the church aren't just halfway in. So, to turn away from it...is not something they take lightly. I think that is the point you've missed.   You are essentially saying that you are better at making choices than your wife is. You are saying that your path is more valid than hers.   What?! How did you get that? Wow. What he is saying is that his choice is not to be brushed aside as ""being deceived"" or ""lazy,"" rather, brave and honest - the qualities he had when they fell in love. His choices don't make him a leper...they are proof that he is what he demonstrated himself to be from the beginning.   Sure, but that doesn't mean he is right.   Red herring. Again, he's trying to show that he is doing what he thinks is right and hoping his wife will love, not resent, him for that.   I imagine she is loving you and respecting your ability to make your own decisions and make changes when you are ready, which isn't something you are offering her.   You have shown repeatedly in your post that you have no clue what it's like for a spouse to suddenly treat you like a disease because you're doing what you think is right, for a spouse to not even want to hear your thoughts or share in your insights. You're not even in the same category when Robin Williams tells Matt Damon in Goodwill Hunting, ""Do you think I'd know the first thing about how hard your life has been, how you feel, who you are because I read Oliver Twist?"" because he at least read a book about an orphan.   What about you, Olsh? How do you know what it's like to watch a spouse see you as a mistake who should wear a muzzle all because you decided to take the red pill?"

exmormon,3dyjys,Iamstuckathope,39,Mon Jul 20 16:09:24 2015 UTC,"Can't upvote this post enough! Get the Church out of your marriage and start really enjoying sex!  Throwaway here because this is TMI to keep in comment history of my regular user name.  I spent almost 8 years of marriage during which my wife never climaxed. We both grew up in super-TBM homes where sex was NEVER discussed. She was a ""good Mormon girls don't enjoy sex"" kind of woman and I was a thoroughly brainwashed ""good Mormon boys don't ever show a high sex drive"" kind of guy. Sex was mostly duty sex from her and it was horrible (there were a few good moments, but not many). Any of you who have been there know what I mean--totally shaming and guilt-inducing for me as the guy and completely unsatisfying and mechanical for her. Ugh, I still cringe thinking about it...  But there's a massive bright side in that leaving the Church was the best thing that ever happened to our sex life (and our marriage). At first I was pissed at the Church for all those years of good, genuine sex they took from me and my wife. But, I've now moved past that and have mostly made my peace with it because sex is so much better on the upside now that I've seen how truly and completely awful it can be on the down side. I know not everyone is as sexually repressed by the Church as wife and I were, but talk about a marriage-saving, mind-blowing transformation... It took some effort, but once the Church was out of the way (and all of its garbage around sexuality, sexual boundaries, and sexual conditioning), things took off to where my wife regularly has double and triple climaxes and we're having a quality of sex (and the incredible closeness that comes with good sex) that we never even could have dreamed was possible in our TBM days. Our marriage, happiness, and sex life have never been better."

In order for there to be a valid contract (which is the secular version of covenant), there must be an offer, an acceptance, consideration, and no undue influence.  First, the whole thing is full of undue influence.  You are asked to decide to agree or disagree by staying or leaving before you even know what the covenants are.  Once you decide to stay, you are not given the option to leave once you hear what the covenant is.  Plus, if you don't enter into these covenants, you are damned, and you will face the ostracism of church leaders, members, and your TBM family.  Second, there's no consideration.  The promise of health?  It's bullshit.  The promise of Kingdoms?  They have none to offer.  ""The blessings of God?""  It rains on the just and the unjust.

If your husband doesn't ""let"" you do things, he's treating you like a child and not like an adult.  Certainly not like an equal parter.

Obviously I can't make decisions for you, but I would recommend leaving him immediately (not necessarily divorce).

I really don't like to shop much, so he'd buy some clothes for me. Then over the years, it got to the point that if I bought something for myself, he would make fun of what I picked and say something like ""it's fine, as long as I don't have to see you wear that"".

You have read both these ideas into words that did not include them.  The only argument I have made is that I think the word ""abusive"" while literally true, is not helpful in describing these actions.  My life reality has left me with the viewpoint that all relationships will have shitty aspects about them. I've yet to meet anyone that had a relationship that didn't have these shitty elements. What OP's husband is doing is certainly manipulative. And he seems to be exhibiting behavior that I would say should change. I would even go so far as to admit it could be classified as ""abusive"" with the caveat that that word can be used over a HUGE spectrum.

exmormon,3dydl1,OneMoreLuckyGuy,4,Mon Jul 20 18:19:39 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you recognize how trigger-happy reddit tends to be on issues like this. Packaging all this up in a box and labeling it ""abuse"" doesn't do much to help understand the complexity of the situation and resolve any problems. My only word of advice would be to try and give your husband the benefit of the doubt while not compromising what is most important to you. If you were the one sprending thousands of hours studying, it makes sense that your transformation has been more fundamental with wider implications, but no reason why you can't have patience with those things the way people have patience with their spouse on church issues. I'd suggest focusing on the ""why"" when it comes to your position on social issues, rather then focusing on what your husband does or says that could be labeled sexist, racist etc. hopefully after some time his behavior will change according to his change in views on these matters. Whatever you do, communicate."
exmormon,3dydl1,mmmochafrappe,2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you. There are definitely two sides to this and I do want to be patient and understanding to help both of us move forward. He has the emotional baggage of seeing both of his parents married and divorced several times. I think that's one of the reasons he clings to me so hard. He wants our marriage to last and to be strong, and I want that also. I know I have been a doormat and allowed all of this behavior to go all of these years unchecked. I don't communicate very well and I don't let my needs or wants known. He can't read my mind.  All I know, is that we have a lot of work to do. Leaving the church just brought it all to the forefront."

But I had the same type of man.   I know acknowledging these things to your self is incredibly hard.  It's so much easier to live in denial. Acknowledging them is gut wrenchingly painful. Seeing the honesty of your life is like looking at a strangers life, and that realization that he is not who you thought, and you have lost who you are is such a slap, that it is easier to not look at it.   Accepting it is your life takes time and strength, and help from a therapist.   Slipping blissfully back in to denial is easily done. But the sacrifice is monumental.  You have to do is ignore, look away,  let go of the things and people you love. Become who he wants you to be. Silence your soul. Eliminate your passions. Put on blinders to the things that hurt,  let him stifle and control you.   I think I choose denial several times, before I couldn't anymore.   For me, leaving my marriage has been like escaping a cage that was rapidly shrinking. I can breath! I can fly!   I say try therapy. If he won't go with you, go alone.  That's what I did.  I hope he can make positive changes, but I'm not sure he will,  just because I know this type of man He sounds JUST like my ex husband.  He  seems to loves a person you are not, and as you change and grow, and rediscover yourself, he might not be willing to love the person you really are.   That is super scary.  I get that.

I'm going to start up therapy again. It has also helped a lot going to school. I'm transferring to a major university this fall and I'm very excited. My area of study is in the sciences and I'll be getting at least a masters degree. It will help me a lot to know that I can support myself if I need to.

exmormon,3dydl1,macabre_trout,5,Mon Jul 20 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"What Roxy said!  I've been there, too, with my ex for almost 13 years.  I will bluntly point out that the people who posted wincing at calling the behavior abuse sound remarkably similar to the asshats who told me to be ""patient and prayerful"" through increasing isolation, criticism, and controlling behavior.  And by asshats I mean four different bishops and counselors.    Dudes, ESPECIALLY IF YOU FEEL LIKE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE BEHAVIOR FEELS UNCOMFORTABLY LIKE THINGS YOU DO, this is not a time to get defensive on behalf of the guy choosing behavior that hurts his wife.  This bothered her enough to come post.  She's looking for support FOR HER.   In the culture we were in in the church, this attitude is painfully common and supported.  DON'T BE THAT GUY.  Klynstr, this is the time to put a lot of your attention into your responses, your feelings, your thoughts.  You've had someone diminish and dismiss them for a long time.  It takes a while to feel and think without feeling guilty or that you're not ""taking care of people.""  That's part of the ""denial"" circuit that Roxy talked about.  We fall into it because we're taught some terrible things about service and the LDS version of marriage.   YOU are important.  What you like, what you think, what you feel.  Love doesn't stand in the way of you getting to be you.  If his ""love"" is, it's not really love.  And living under the mantle of control in the guise of love is a poison that kills slowly.  Be you."
exmormon,3dydl1,Mlawksh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:18 2015 UTC,"THIS! ALL the THINGS. I needed weekly counseling to sort my feelings, it was so difficult to really feel them at first. In my case, speaking openly with my husband woke him up to how seriously I felt. I realized I had a lot of negative self-talk that I placed as his opinion IN MY MIND but wasn't how he felt. But he did have misogynistic ways and patterns of behavior to grow out of. It was a joint effort, but really more my effort (in counseling and then in owning my own life). Patience and effort has made my marriage now better than it ever was for both of us. Good luck, OP."
exmormon,3dydl1,crowsmack,6,Tue Jul 21 02:27:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not a part of your relationship, so I have no idea how abusive he is or isn't; that is not a call for me to make. But there is one thing I'd like to mention.    His control over me is done with guilt trips, disapproval, passive aggressiveness or by putting down my ideas.    That form of control only really works if you let it. It only works if you actually feel guilty, if you let disapproval stop you from doing things, etc. I guess what I'm saying is that it takes two to tango and that no single person holds sole responsibility.  Again, I don't know the details, this narrative might be completely out of line. But I'd hate for things to turn into ""he's been abusing me for decades"" when it might have been little more than ""I was insecure and let anything and everything stop me"".   It sounds like you are coming out of your shell, coming more into your own, so to speak. You are turning into someone that will no longer be stopped by such roadblocks. That is a good thing, in my opinion. But when looking to the past, judge with a fair hand. Maybe his behavior didn't help, maybe yours didn't. If you must dole out responsibility, do so without the ""I hold zero blame"" mentality. Finding the things that you might not have done well will help your personal growth far more than finding the things that he has done."

By all means, you SHOULD be upsetting that balance though, if you are not happy where you are. But this, of course, has changed things for your husband who was probably content with how things were. If he really loves you, he will cope and make an effort to adjust to the shift. If you have things to say, you should definitely be vocal. Talk to him about the things you have observed in his behavior, in reference to his prejudice and sexism.  Just don't expect things to change as rapidly as you would like them to. These things take time and you'll likely have to use some measure of patience."

It is going to be hard to adjust to the upset in balance. I'm not sure if my husband can handle a strong woman :)
exmormon,3dydl1,portiaofbelmont,5,Mon Jul 20 18:35:43 2015 UTC,He sounds like a bit of a narcissist :(. Narcissists internally believe (I don't think they even see this themselves - or are capable of seeing it) that the entire world revolves around them  When he's limiting your interactions with family members - your taking attention away from him.  When you're playing music - you're taking attention away from him.  When you're at school - you guessed it...  My mother is a bit of one sadly :(.

In the living room, at someone else's house, when we're with the kids, etc. He will never let one of our children sit in between us. And when we're at home, he gets agitated if we're not in the same room.   I've never talked about this or put any of this together in one place, so I never saw the patterns or red flags. I'll have to do some research. Thanks!"

exmormon,3dydl1,Devil_Doc_Pyronight,4,Mon Jul 20 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"How do you think he would respond to counseling?  Did you leave the church recently?  If so that could be good cover for why you want to see a counselor - to help with your ""faith transition.""  That would be an easier conversation that ""hey, I want to see a counselor because you're a mysoginistic ass and need to change.""  But honestly, it sounds like you guys need marriage counseling.  If he's truly as misogynistic as you say, you will never be the one to convince him that he needs to change.  And even though this plays into the misogynistic tendencies, I would highly recommend getting a male counselor.  If you convince him to go but the counselor is female, you run the risk of him discounting what she says with an ""I know better"" attitude, or writing her off as a feminist.  A male counselor can probably call him on the carpet with more success.  When another guy that he sees as not being a feminist tells him he's being a misogynistic ass, it's more likely to sink in.  Just my $0.02.  Good luck!  EDIT:  Clarity"

exmormon,3dydl1,enderofgalaxies,3,Mon Jul 20 19:23:54 2015 UTC,Is it possible to express your dissatisfaction with his views and treatment of you.  Just before my husband and I left the church I started to recognize how little I felt supported by him in my goals that weren't typically feminine (like school and working etc.).  Telling him how I felt made him consider my feelings and his behavior and he's made a conscious effort to change and things are improved somewhat.  He also used to be fairly homophobic.  Whenever he would crack a homophobic joke I wouldn't laugh and would often (gently) challenge his jokes and challenge his insecurities about sexuality (very very gently).  Now he get pissed when people say crap about gay people.  It took some time.  Maybe even 3 years :(.  I'm not saying you should stick with your situation for 3 years to see if there is a change.  Your husband is far more controlling than mine ever was.  I'll second the message from u/gracethepirate (current top comment).  Good luck.  Icky marriage stuff stinks.

I also want to mention (and it may have already been said) that abuse is a very loaded word which can make an abusive situation very confusing for both the abuser and abused.  Abuse typically comes from a place of good intentions, but bad actions.  Your husband probably loves you very much and wants to protect you and doesn't realize his methods of protection are inappropriate.  Being an abuser doesn't make you the bad person the word culturally indicates.  It simply means you lack skills to handle situations in healthy, productive, and supportive ways."

Do NOT let him take away something you enjoy and are talented at. Although I know now that the church is based on lies, and very little good comes out of it, I thank my membership in the church for introducing me to music at a young age.

The reason why I am confident of this is because I was the exact same way.   I was extremely racist and prejudice against whites and blacks (especially this ethnic group if memory serves).  I was a misogynistic asshole, which is strange to me because at the height of my assholery was when I met my wife. Whom at the time when we married I expected her to being perpetually pregnant and accept it because I and TSCC said so even if she was still Catholic.  I also truly disliked the gay community especially its male members.  It took years of being disconnected from TSCC, the military, ending up in a psych ward, starting school and getting an education, being exposed to many people of so many different cultures throughout my life, and finally having the sense to piece reality together and realize that those things walking around getting in my way and annoying me to the point of wanting to kill them were people.

Telling you who you can talk to and what your career or job choices should be and putting down you going to school? WTF?   You need to tell him to catch up or you will continue on the journey without him.   I wouldn't label him as much an abuser as he is a control freak - but possibly because you have enabled him and allowed it. You probably need counseling to set some appropriate boundaries."

exmormon,3dydl1,codemoney,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:37 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like there may be some codependency going on in your marriage.  Obviously your husband has some very abusive behaviors, but you have in essence been a ""doormat"" and enabled it to continue all these years for the sake of keeping the peace.  It also sounds like your lives are unhealthily enmeshed, like you're the same person instead of two different individuals.    Your situation sounds very similar to mine.  My marriage didn't have any major problems until after we left the church; I finally realized that without the church making me feel like I had to be my husband's submissive puppet-on-a-string, I could begin to become my own person and call him out on his bad behaviors.  And he didn't like that at all.  By going though some very difficult obstacles, we realized our relationship had been extremely codependent.  Not only was it crippling us, no one person was responsible and we were actually both to blame for the unhappy state of things.  If you don't know much about codependence, I highly reccomend looking into it to see if it might apply to your situation.  There's so much to learn about it, but the basic gist is that instead of finding happiness in yourself for who you are, you think your spouse should be the one to make you happy, to fill you up, to ""complete you.""  This defecit usually stems from childhood, where somewhere along the way you were shamed by your parents who didn't know how to love you unconditionally.  Therefore, you came to think of yourself as being unloveable simply for who you are, and that you must find that love in someone else.  Not so--you should never need anyone else to make you happy, and true happiness comes from within yourself and having true self love.  It also comes from being your own unique person and having healthy boundaries with others.    I'd guess that this may be some of what has been going on with both you and your husband, and the behaviors you've both been engaging in to allow your marriage to continue like it has been.  He has been controlling you, even emotionally abusing you, while also doing nice things for you--probably because he's scared you'll leave if you're your own strong and independent person.  And you're a people pleaser, and you've wanted his acceptance and approval, so you've allowed this because you're probably scared he'll leave if you challenge him.  The bottom line is that both of you are fearful of being alone, and think you need the other person to feel ""okay"" and that you're loveable.  This should come from within, not from someone else.  Of course I'm not saying this is what's definitely happening with you and your husband, but I wouldn't be surprised.  You said that you like to listen to podcasts, which is great!  I do too.  There's a woman named Darlene Lancer who is a therapist and expert on codependency and its negative effects on relationships, and I can't tell you how much my husband and I have learned from listening to her.  She's featured as a guest on a number of different relationship podcasts, so if you search her name you should be able to find them.  You can also find some of her stuff on youtube.  Another therapist who's equally as knowledable about codependency and has also helped us a lot is a man named Robert Burney.  I believe you can find a couple podcasts where he's a featured guest as well.  Oh and both of these therapists have written self-help books too.  Good luck, I hope you can both find happiness...whether that be on your own or together."

Now, I have a dimple/cleft chin, but neither of my parents does.  My partner says I went as white as a sheet before frantically Googling, only to find that this isn't actually true.

exmormon,3e11e3,NoMoBlues,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:10 2015 UTC,"I could definitely see how being an ""inactive"" Mormon might negatively impact a person's mental health in a highly Mormon populated area. A strong perception of rejection or shame from one's close social bonds can easily push someone into deep depression. Mormons tend to have hundreds of tight-nit connections, because of the way wards and stakes are organized. This leads to the potential for a higher degree of social pain. Chronic social pain is processed just like chronic physical pain in the brain, which statistically puts someone at higher risk for depression and suicide.  Teens feel social pain very intensely, because they are experiencing it for the first time. Social media probably only has intensified this effect. So sadly Mormon teens in highly Mormon populated areas are often given much more than they can bare, especially if the shame or social rejection is from something like their sexuality or inability to conform to other Mormon ideals such as missions or complete abstinence of masturbation or other normal sexual developmental stages."

exmormon,3e11e3,PonderosaPineapple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:05:20 2015 UTC,"There's also evidence that altitude may play a large part in depression and rates of suicide (sorry, no reference on hand). So we might be making a direct connection between Mormonism and suicide when it could really be the result of Mormons having settled and culturally dominated high altitude areas. Additionally, the topography of the I-15 corridor (heavily Mormon) tends to support the formation of inversions/overcast weather for much of the year--thus leading to a higher incidence of SAD (seasonal affective disorder) on par with rates seen in Alaska. But then Mormonism is just oppressive, and as you said, isolating, which is depressing enough. My suspicion though is that it's probably an unfortunate combination of all three factors that contribute to a higher suicide rate."

At the time of his/her arrest Felix/Leasa had resumed life as a man. I'm not even sure what the proper pronoun usage is for an individual who has partially undergone gender reassignment surgery and hormone therapy, and then returned to their original gender.  It sounds like Felix/Leasa really was pretty troubled. She married under false pretenses (she claimed to  be pregnant with Bruce's twins) when they first married. Then she claimed cancer. Bruce's thought he was paying for cancer treatment; the money instead went for continued hormone therapy. And the ""cancer"" provided several years of excuses as to why they couldn't consummate the marriage. And Bruce sounds pretty naïve to believe that Leasa could have gotten pregnant from a make out session in the first place."

He prayed for a whole week, and he didn't get any turkey, and at the end of a week he said: ""Dis heah niggah don' know how to pray,"" so that night the negro prayed, ""Oh Lawd, oh Lawd, oh Lawd, send dis heah niggah to a turkey,"" and he said, ""Dis heah niggah had turkey dinner the next night."""

Anyway, my nevermo SIL was kind of shocked and didn't know what to say, and my brother was out of it - so they gave him a blessing.       Seriously?

How is telling girls that they could be raped for dressing* shouldn't dress provocatively the same as encouraging or standardizing rape?    When I hear ""rape culture"", I think of places like the congo (where rape is considered ""a simple fact of life""), or India (where they are more or less apathetic to it due to frequency and culture), or ISIS (and the systematic rape of entire tribes).   In these places people either don't care, encourage it, or just accept it as fact that they can't solve.  To me that's rape culture. It's expected, tolerated, or accepted  by the culture.   I think we devalue the term when they try to apply ""rape culture"" to every reminder that sexuality and unwanted attraction exists. I'm not agreeing with this woman in the slightest (in this case), but rape is not tolerated here simply because it's rape and that just happens.     Again, I want to be clear that I think the comments made by the woman are overboard, but ""rape culture?"" I don't see how that hyperbole is justified.   *Edit: Just re-read the post.  It actually doesn't say anything about rape.  It's mostly a push of religious beliefs on attire which (while I don't agree with it) doesn't even suggest rape as a possible outcome."
exmormon,3e1i8k,curious_mormon,2,Tue Jul 21 12:52:16 2015 UTC,"Okay, I see your point...perhaps rape culture is the wrong term. Busybodyness? It's none of her business what the other girls were wearing. If she objects, she should talk to her daughter or the coach.   Maybe I will ask her why it matters to her and find out, as I suspect, that it is a ""you'll make boys think you're asking for attention."" She was not overtly referring to rape but was absolutely trying to shame 1/2 the team for their clothing choices. It's inappropriate.   I may also be a little sensitive bc of similar experiences where my MIL directly said that my 12 yo daughter's cute two piece was not safe for my 3 to male nephew to be around...

The onus is on women to be modest, not on men not to be rapey. It is exemplified by statements like ""well, she was out late and had too much to drink, so what did she expect?"" It doesn't mean that there is an overt acceptance of rape in the culture, but that women are responsible for men's thoughts."

exmormon,3dxfhq,the_starbase_kolob,3,Tue Jul 21 01:57:47 2015 UTC,"So this was new to me as of a couple of months ago.  I'll explain it as best I can without visual aids:  1st token of the Aaronic Priesthood--the penalty is slitting your throat with the right hand with your thumb extended.  Once you're done slitting your throat, you make the sign by raising your right arm to the square with your hand exactly as it was when you slit your throat.  Second token of the Aaronic Priesthood--the penalty is slashing your chest open by dragging your right hand with the thumb extended upward and diagonally across your chest.  Once you're done, you go into the sign phase by raising your right hand to the square with your hand as it was and your left hand at your side in cupping shape so as to catch the blood draining from your body.  First token of the Melchizedek Priesthood--the penalty is disembowelling yourself by dragging your right hand with the thumb extended across your abdomen.  Once you're done, you go into the sign by holding out your right arm with the hand as it was at your side with your other hand in cupping shape so as to catch the blood and intestines coming out of your body.

exmormon,3dxfhq,getyourhairwet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:18:48 2015 UTC,"It's a holdover from the pre-1990 endowments. You would perform an action, like cutting open your stomach, and end with the hands in the token.   That's why you have the hand in front of you with the thumb out while the other is in cupping shape. You had just slid the palm-down hand across the belly, and the cupped hand was catching the guts, blood.  The hand to the square/hand in cupping shape was similar. You slid your hand across the throat and ended with the hand in the air while the cupped hand caught the blood.

I do not pity the LDS church in any way, but I take issue with the dishonesty in the representation of baptism for the dead. It is an incorrect stereotype that Mormons baptize people into their religion after they die. A TBM would be offended to be told he believes that and will subsequently dismiss anything you say as anti-Mormon distortion of the truth. A TBM believes that they simply make it possible for a deceased person in the spirit world to choose to be baptized by accepting the baptism done by proxy on their behalf. Christopher Hitchens made the same mischaracterization in 'God is not Great' and it discredits his whole book in the eyes of a TBM."

First, let's start with a short musical introduction on what it's like to be a True Believing Mormon dude.  Now a basic overview of the gospel.  Then an explanation of the nature of your soul and where it came from and where it's going.  That deal with polygamy explained.  Why Mormons are not sexist.  Why Mormons are not racist.  How the Book of Abraham was translated from Egyptian scrolls.  The Book of Mormon summarised in ~6 minutes.  Why prophets are awesome.  Why the Mormon Church is Not a Cult.  What goes on in those sacred temples?  The importance of modesty.  The importance of tithing your money.  Why Mormons don't hate gay people.   Then here for a musical explanation of how those who yearn for a rational faith can resolve doubt through symbolical interpretation.  And here's a fabulous musical explanation of how the church came to franchise it's ecclesiastical services and doctrinal instruction in a process known as correlation.  How church discipline works.  Now learn about how all of your doubts can be resolved through apologetics.   And here's an excellent video on the importance of religious freedom.  Cheers!"

She stood with me when I handed my letter to the bishop demanding that no questions of a direct or implicitly sexual nature ever be asked of my children and that no teachings of a sexual nature be presented in class without my prior approval. She agrees with me on just about everything regarding what is good and what is harmful, and in the rare cases where we disagree we allow our love to be more important that what one of us is dogmatically convinced that the other is wrong about.  People believe all sorts of different things in this world, and just because I'm quite convinced that I'm right doesn't mean I should be an ass about it towards the most important person in my life.

Every parent has every right in the world to share honest personal views with his or her child without filtering or double-checking with a ""professional.""  If you don't believe in the church, just say you don't believe in the church.  Everything you said about your youngest and the background with you and your other children indicates that your 13 yr old is not going to be shocked.  On the other hand, if it feels easier and smoother to talk this out with your wife, and that makes your marriage work better (and maybe it gives you an opportunity to have more persuasive doctrinal discussions with her) then you might have a lot to gain by the dialogue, even with a professional, if that's what she wants.

exmormon,3e0kxk,reddolfo,2,Tue Jul 21 03:51:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with Acesoami.  There is nothing at all wrong with owning your ""testimony"" in full, with full disclosure.    However, I think the danger is not with your child, but with your wife.  She wishes to disclose your position. I am concerned she has not thought therough the possibilities.   In this vein I would suggest you role play a little with her to follow the various possible scenarios.  Play out what she would do and think if, for example, child says ""cool, I don't believe either"" and then wife is left alone as the sole believer.  Let her know your plan is to quit the charade after the reveal -- this may appear as an ambush if she is caught unawares.  Try and be specific about your intention to answer every question and be complete in your explanations.    The big thing here IMO is to manage wife's expectations so things do not go down an unexpected path, and potentially freak her out, and create a crisis for everyone.  I would not easily consent to this process unless I was pretty sure of the reactions to the most likely outcomes.   Let us know how it goes if you do it."

Hebrews 11:1 explains that faith is things hoped for, the evidence of which is not seen. In other words, faith is believing something without sufficient evidence to believe it, but believing it anyway because you HOPE it is true. Why do you believe that simply hoping that something is true is a good way to find out if it is actually true? Is there any other aspect of your life in which you determine something is true by hoping that it is?""  After discussing that for a bit, you could then move on to this: ""I agree with you that faith is about feelings and not facts. So what do we tell a Muslim who feels that Islam is the one true religion? Or a Heavens Gate cult member? Or a member of the FLDS polygamist religion? Or a Westboro Baptist? Or a Scientologist? Remember, you can't point out to them that their doctrines are harmful, or wrong, or disproved by science, or ridiculous, or anything else because they FEEL that their religion is true, and that's what faith is, right? It's finding truth through feelings.""  And then maybe you could end with this: ""If faith (learning truth through feelings) is a reliable way to find truth, how do you know that the Muslims, FLDS members, cult members, or scientologists aren't right and you're wrong? If they've confirmed that their religions are the most correct through faith (feelings), then how do you know they're wrong?

One of the biggest things that changed my mind about TSCC is the lack of Christ-like actions.  The things that Jesus taught were great, whether or not he was divinely inspired.  He taught the golden rule, and that you should love others like yourself.  The one-true-church should act accordingly, and it doesn't.    Instead of trying to change her mind with facts.  Align with her beliefs about being Christ-like, then you are working with her, instead of trying to change her mind.  Once I could see how un-Christlike the TSCC is, the facts started making more sense and the flaws became obvious."

I thought since I had served a mission, and she hadn't then she just didn't understand the gospel well enough to prioritize church attendance. She just didn't get it. Is what I thought. I mean, how could she? She had never had any leadership responsibility, or the types of spiritual moments that I had. So ultimately, had I listened to her, and not been a complete dolt, I could have been out a lot sooner. Maybe your husband could be feeling similarly."

Now many shall say this book be not a true book, for they shall think that it was made up, and that the things written in it did not really happen. And the enemies of this book shall say that because it has bad grammar, yea, it is not a true book, and because no evidence doth support it, yea, it is not a true book. Nevertheless, believe not the words of the enemies of this book, for I challenge thee to take a gamble, and believe the words within this book, yea, even shall ye roll the dice on the truthfulness of this book. For many Lamanites do roll the dice, and gamble for money, but yea, no gamble shall be more important than betting on the truthfulness of this book. And I promise thee that if ye ask if this book be not true, and roll a pair of dice with a sincere heart, and desire exceedingly for the book to be true, yea, the dice shall reveal the truthfulness of this book unto thee. And if ye roll a seven, yea, it doth mean this book be a true book, and ye shall rejoice at the knowledge of the truthfulness of this book. For no learned man shall sway thy opinion with supposed evidences against this book, for once the dice have spoken the debate is over. And if ye roll not a seven, yea, fear not that this book be not true, for this book is true, yea, even do I promise. And something that is true cannot be proven untrue. Wherefore, if ye roll not a seven, it be not the fault of this book, and it doth prove not that this book be untrue, because this book is true, wherefore, it cannot be proven untrue. Wherefore, if ye roll not a seven it was an error, and ye must roll the dice again, yea, even with a more sincere heart, and even desiring more to know the truth. And if ye again roll not a seven, and if ye roll not a seven three times, yea, it be the fault of the dice. Wherefore, retrieve different dice, and roll again. And ye must keep rolling dice until ye roll seven. And after the manner in which ye roll a seven, behold, ye shall rejoice at thy knowledge of the truthfulness of this book.

I think that he may have been a tad harsh on the atheism thing. There are some amazingly trustworthy atheists out there and some very untrustworthy theists. What LDH has a problem with is that they're trying to apply a theistic system of morality, philosophy and self-improvement to people who don't believe in its foundational assertions.  For those who don't know, Le Droit Humain is an offshoot of Masonry that mainstream Freemasons don't consider to be ""regular"" (e.g. we don't consider them to be Masons). They're part of a larger body of Freemasonry commonly called ""Continental Freemasonry,"" of which the largest and oldest body is the Grand Orient of France (also not recognized by mainstream Freemasonry).  So, mostly I think this was a jab at LDH, not atheists or ex-theists in general."
exmormon,3e06m6,aaronsherman,2,Tue Jul 21 04:19:47 2015 UTC,"Missing the point. It's not that I personally think trustworthiness is linked to theism so much as many theists and particularly freemasons tend to think this. I thought the hosts were very fair to freemasonry in their assessment, but I think Brad is feeding into the the mindset that Atheists can't be trusted with secrets by, well, not being trusted with secrets. And Le Droit Humain would probably think the same thing, I'd wager.   There are plenty of masons who politely ducked out after one degree, and kudos for Brad to recognize that theism is a part of Masonry. I think freemasons downplay that too much. But the promise a first degree mason gives is pretty simple. Do not reveal.  That's going to be a part of any mystery school revival, including Le Droit Humain."

It's all over youtube. Post anything you want. Those aren't the secrets anyway.  I'm friends with plenty of atheists. They can keep their word. Because they don't believe in God, they know their good word is all they have, and they do their best to make it mean something. The most often cited reasoning for excluding atheists from freemasonry is, in short, because they can't swear to deity, nothing really binds them to their word. There's a lot of debate in philosophical and masonic circles about whether that's valid, or an unfair stereotype. This isn't helping the case that atheists can be trusted.   You seemed to have a good grasp of the concepts when you joined. If you had no intention of keeping your word, why did you give it? If you had intended to keep your word, why did you break it? Why lay it aside after you determine it's not important to you? Are you the highest judge of what's important and unimportant?  These aren't questions you should answer to me, but to yourself.

Unlike your buddy at /xxmasonic who cowardly banned me and THEN posted a reply. Yes I do have a good grasp, and yes I did intend on keeping my word. This was years ago. You can tell from listening to the podcast that my memory of the events were spotty.   However, at this point in my life, I have no sense of loyalty to groups who claim divine backing. You are right that in the end I'm only accountable to myself, not you, not a mod of some meaningless sub, not freemasonry. In whom do I put my trust? What do I stand for? I stand for reality, I stand for openness, I stand for inclusion not exclusion, I stand for truth, REAL truth, not jargon or groupthink. I stand for freedom, not control.

Secrets may get out, but not through my lips, because you can depend on me, your brother, even when the rest of the world goes to shit, and I will fly to your relief however I am able.   Divinity is important to freemasonry, but freemasonry itself is the highest ideals of the Enlightenment. At least when it's well done. It's mostly not well done. People suck."
exmormon,3e06m6,DedLed,0,Tue Jul 21 16:39:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe making it personal doesn't get the point across. I'll say it another way. When an organization (let's set masonry aside, let's call it the LDS church) tells you a secret, they control you.  From what I personally observed in freemasonry, the ideals of enlightenment that are contained in symbols and allegory, are rarely ever achieved. I only met maybe one or two masons that I would consider ""enlightened"" the rest were lemmings just like in every organization. We agree on that.  I have the highest regard for the symbols and allegory but I obviously have a disregard for secrets and the act of being forced to keep them.  If you want REAL enlightenment, not just ego imagined enlightenment, one is better off sampling 5meo-dmt than wasting their time kneeling down at an altar."

The third hieroglyphic means ""And it came to pass"" The fourth hieroglyphic is about how man is evil and unworthy without the grace of God.  It goes on to say that you can only buy the grace and salvation through the rituals I provide.  They come at the low-low cost of a lifetime of devotion, service, and money. The fifth hieroglyphic means ""Wherefore, it came to pass"" The sixth hieroglyphic is a 20 verse stanza (10 of which I'll add later) that tells you that I was meant to read this at this time and place.   The seventh eighth hieroglyphic are a retelling of some of the archaic parts of Alma, mostly taken out of context, and written by Joseph Smith's own hand (to be re-interpreted later after carbon dating shows these could not have existed in the 1800s which follows up on a claim the building was spiritually erected several months before the 15 year celebration of Joseph translated the Book of Mormon.

This temple was built to the earthquake code of the City, no more, less.  From all I can tell during the construction process, the Church operates like a good ol' boy's club, re-using the contractor who had built the Medford, Oregon temple a few years previously because he had been faithful and true (paid his tithing, etc).  He and his company's main people commuted from Medford during the construction.  The Church attempted every trick known to development to accomplish exactly what it wanted, including trying very hard to persuade me to waive the requirement for fire sprinklers inside (as such things ruin the furnishings, sprinklers going off without a real fire being present).  The most money is spent on the interior and exterior finishes, not on the construction of the structure, though it is solid, nothing fancy against ""extra"" earthquake protection.  They also tried to save money by using a structural engineer not licensed in Washington State, and tried to get me to ""waive"" that requirement, also.  I was a TBM at the time, but now I realize that all that happened was some major cracks in my shelf.  The biggest crack was my stake president called and told me NOT to release the location of the temple until the Church told me to.  I replied that it was public record now that they had submitted an actual application for permit with the location shown (obviously, you have tell the City where you're going to build the damn thing).  I was set to baptize my oldest daughter the following Saturday when the stake president called, and he called me at home before I left for work.  The PR department of TSCC hadn't properly released the location, so they didn't want anyone saying where it was ahead of them.  Myths abound, it's true, about many facets of the temple.  One myth was that the land had been owned by a member of TSCC and he donated the land, as if this was some miracle that he had owned the precious parcel and preserved it for the temple.  Truth was that a rich doctor, non Mormon one, owned the land, sold it to a rich Mormon right before the temple began construction, and that rich Mormon donated the land to TSCC as a final tithing payment before entering retirement.  So much for ""inspired"" purchases of knowing where the temple would be built.  Biggest goof up of the temple construction:  they began using it before hooking up the baptismal font sewer drain to the proper line, and it leaked all over the 12 oxen, beneath their tile floor.  Second biggest goof up, you go into the Celestial Room, look up at the great chandelier, and the entire painted motif of various geometric shapes, together with the raised outline of the motif's shapes, is crooked, off center, and looks silly.  Hey, but who looks up beyond the chandelier, very few people, I guess."

exmormon,3dzs57,fruittester,3,Mon Jul 20 21:45:41 2015 UTC,"Nevermo here with LDS dealings: Let's get down to it.  1) I've done some serious business with LDS over the years and they don't even know what Net 30 or Net 60 is, or at least they feign ignorance well. They pay 90 and take the Net 30 terms. And you just roll your eyes and deal with it.  Wal-Mart is known as the giant asshole golden standard of payables in this universe, possibly the entire multiverse, but LDS is a pretty close second.  2) I know something of the San Antonio temple design. The blueprints are on public file. Some of the finer details are not there but structural/foundational, drainage, fire suppression, ingress/egress, plumbing and wiring is pretty well documented.   I pulled these prints because one of my clients wanted a reference design, to save on structural engineering costs for their project. It's a long story but sometimes clients with no architectural or engineering knowledge want you to pull designs ""as a boilerplate"" to save on actual architectural design, so they can dress it up in a facade. In other words, they want the prestige appearance of custom design, but without the custom price or any of the material benefits of uniqueness. It's rather like a Ferrari kit car built on a VW Beetle chassis.  I deal routinely with Japanese, Indian, Oregon and Washington earthquake standards and can tell you with a fair degree of certainty, that there was nothing particularly remarkable, seismically-speaking, in the San Antionio Temple, known as the ""Modern-Day Temple"" design.  Furthermore, I can say for certain that the San Antonio Temple possesses no notable dynamic isolation frames or substructures and no remarkable bracing for lateral stress, shearing force or torsional stresses. Nor is the foundation particularly resistant against liquefaction.   It may indeed exceed local seismic code but that's not hard to achieve in a geologically stable area with modest seismic requirements, using a standard blueprint called the ""Modern-Day Temple"" designed to be redeployed across multiple locations with minimum modification.  Assuming The Almighty wants to get people's undivided attention, He's going to probably go with a Richter 6 to 8. A ""5"" will do some cracking to the structure. A ""6"" will do some serious damage. A ""7"" will make the structure a severe hazard and probably tumble the tower. And ""8"" will, as the seismologists say ""fuck it up."""

The mechanism for the theory right now favors natural selection. However HOW evolution happens (natural selection, genetic drift, bottleneck effect) is not as established as evolution (descent with modification).  However the theory of evolution is both a fact and a theory, a theory because of the vast body of evidence that supports it.  Gravity is observable, testable and predictable, that is why it can be labeled a law, as in the verb sense.

She and my kids are now out of TSCC :) I always took the stance that I would support her decision to go to church and I wouldn't try to talk her out of going, I would tell her this frequently. I constantly pushed her to open her mind but not really on church related things, don't gossip, don't judge, etc. I knew she would either stay in TSCC forever or she would exit in her own time. I just made sure that I was the best example of an exmo I could be, and I waited for TSCC to do what it does best and just collapse in on itself with its hatred and contradictions. We found a way to live and love while believing different things, I didn't want to push for fearing of just driving her deeper in. Funny thing about my wife learning about my doubts and concerns, she heard them when the bishopric would come over to meet with me and I would explain my problems, she would be sitting there listening, otherwise she might have been completely unaware of most of my feelings."

It sounds like she'd answer no to the question, ""If the church were not true, would you want to know?""  Good job on marriage counseling. You both need to decide what you are willing to give and accept in your relationship.    one of the issues I think we have between us is your perception about why I don't believe in the church anymore. I know I've discussed lots of issues with you, but it has always been very superficial. Most of the arguments against the church you've heard have been from me, and since you don't tend to trust me, I think a lot of what I say comes across as overly negative or biased to you, and not really valid.   I needed to hear from my wife that she accepted that I had given Mormonism my best shot, and that I had gotten my answer that it wasn't the place for me. I didn't want to be in relationship where she believed I was deficient or lazy or deceived. It sounds like you want something similar. I'd bring up her perception of you and explore it."

exmormon,3e0iey,rhonek,3,Tue Jul 21 00:59:44 2015 UTC,It is a great example.  I don't know that we teach that appears to have replaced Thu sayeth the Lord.
exmormon,3e0iey,rhonek,2,Tue Jul 21 01:07:09 2015 UTC,"Other than this garbage from the 14 fundamentals of following the prophet:   Sixth: The prophet does not have to say “Thus saith the Lord” to give us scripture.  Sometimes there are those who argue about words. They might say the prophet gave us counsel but that we are not obliged to follow it unless he says it is a commandment. But the Lord says of the Prophet, “Thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you.” (D&C 21:4.)  And speaking of taking counsel from the prophet, in D&C 108:1, the Lord states:  “Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Lyman: Your sins are forgiven you, because you have obeyed my voice in coming up hither this morning to receive counsel of him whom I have appointed.”  Said Brigham Young, “I have never yet preached a sermon and sent it out to the children of men, that they may not call scripture.” (Journal of Discourses, 13:95.)"
exmormon,3e0iey,Orbiting_Kolob,2,Tue Jul 21 01:38:38 2015 UTC,"Yep. One of my favorite prophecies is the one where Nephi predicts the arrival of Columbus:  ""I looked, and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed of my brethren, who were in the promised land"" (1 Nephi 13:12).  One of the coolest things about this one is that Nephi himself basically says that the Taino Indians encountered by Columbus were descendents of Israelites. Yet the DNA evidence shows they are not.  So the part that Joseph Smith knew about in 1829 -- the part about Columbus -- is right. But the part he didn't know about in 1829 is wrong.  Funny how that works."

See if his eyes perk up and he smiles/giggles or he looks at you like he's got no fucking clue what you're talking about[1].  Or better yet, fwd him one of the church essays and tell him it came up in a meeting and you were wondering if he read it. You can go back and forth a few times and open up with your doubts if he seems to also have doubts, while if he gives you the standard TBM talking points you'll know to not pursue it further, but it won't be obvious that you're doubting.  [1] Plenty of exmo's leave the church and realize it's bullshit without reading tons of FAIR/FARMS, so it's certainly possible that he doesn't know the reference, yet is an exmo.

Was it what he expected? How did he fit in as a missionary, was he like most of the rest or did he do things differently? Did his specific mission focus too much on numbers and less about the people? Did he have any favorite missionaries/companions? Did he have any missionaries/companions he didn't get along with? Did he consider extending his call (is that a thing anymore, if not does he wish he could have)? If he could go back would he do anything differently? What advice would he give a new missionary or a person considering serving a mission? I could go on and on, but the point is that you can ask all of these questions without ever having to admit you are exmo, but hopefully by the end of all this you would know a little bit better where he stood. You could then potentially ask him about BYU, his opinion on the honor code, if he thinks it is good the BYU will kick out exmos while letting nevermos stay?"

I told her to talk to his mission president, but of course he had taken care of that as well, he suggested she get help for her obsession and repent. This happened to her cousin as well, I guess there are a few of the brothers out there that have the same M.O: Blame the women, stand your ground and everything will work out in the end.  I hope you take some advice here and get him in trouble, I'll wager this isn't the first time he's done this."

Massive text message from him saying how wrong it was of us and that he would be seeing the mission president that day and to not contact him again.    Massive case of the guilts on his part. He doesn't know how to handle this sex thing.   ""I didn't see the mission president because I only have 3 months left and don't want to get sent home early but you really need to repent.""    Same thing, different rationalization. His first mistake is that because he feels something he believes you feel something. This will happen again and again to him with others until he figures this out. Second, of course, is making the sin not his therefore nothing he has to take to the MP and/or repent for.    He asked if I could email him tit pics   Well he's not over it yet. SIGH. I do wish TSCC could teach these guys HOW to deal with the emotional stuff that happens. Problem is that sin thing, it really gets in the way of handling it without losing their mind.  Obviously this is not your fault in any way, he has to project the fault on you or reprogram himself to be TBM in appearance but not in fact. This is also bad BTW."

They want to experience life as I do.  So they start hanging out.  They swear.  They maybe have a beer or hang out with us at a party.  Then they go totally 180 and disavow everything and tattle on themselves.  My TBM nephew recently started hanging out with me a bunch.  We even smoked pot.  He would hang out and get drunk with us.  He told us how happy he felt not being ""held down"" by the Church.  He told us he ""feels like himself.""  Then one day, BAM, doesn't return my texts or calls.  His mother, my sister-in-law, blocks me on social media and he is the new Elders Quorum President of his BYU YSA ward.  All I can do is laugh.  I know what happened.

They were planning on sneaking off and her doing a striptease for him the day before he got transferred when they got caught. The worst part about this story? My fuckhead mission president didn't send him home and instead covered it up because the relationship between missionaries and that ward was so bad that if anyone found out, the members would never let missionaries in their doors again. So instead of going to jail like he should have, this pedophile missionary finished an 'honorable' mission, and only me and one other elder ever knew about it.

""I didn't see the mission president because I only have 3 months left and don't want to get sent home early but you really need to repent.""   This is immaturity talking -- not realizing that you may have experienced the exchange vastly different from how he did.  He felt like what he was doing was exciting and sexual and therefore wrong, and therefore it was the same for you.  Not only would it not be wrong for you, but it wasn't even how you experienced it.  His super wrong perspective invalidates any ""advice"" he has to give you.  In fact, he's most likely saying such things in an attempt to reconcile and fix what he's dealing with.  BTW, I was a missionary, I remember just how little talking about sex it took to get me into ""oh no danger! but also exciting!"" emotion/thought territory.   ""Oh no I'm just wanting to know this before I go home and get married in the temple.""   Compensation -- ""I'm good, I promise.  At least, I will be if I keep saying I am!""  Poor guy.  I honestly feel sorry for him and know he needs a friend who will help him unwrap his emotional conflicts over his thoughts and guilt and obligation.   He asked if I could email him tit pics so I asked if I could show him the CES Letter... He said no, he doesn't want to hear anything anti mormon.   LOL, again, unbelievable that he doesn't see the irony here.  But, that just indicates immaturity and someone in need.   Let me just reiterate 100% I did not talk sexual at all! Only answering bluntly and deflecting questions! I did not encourage him!   Again, don't worry!  NOT your problem!  Seriously, please stop feeling any guilt right this second.  Even if you did talk sexual or wanted to or anything, NOT your problem.  This missionary is likely not as creepy inside as he seems, but is probably a repressed and naturally sexual young male.  He needs a friend, needs help, and needs to sort out his priorities -- we are all sexual, but it absolutely shouldn't be forced on anyone and shouldn't be wrapped up in or projected into guilt."

Best to do it at a manly place without her around.  Something like a restaurant that serves steak  or a golf course if that is what he is in to.  Make it someplace he'll feel safe.  2) Sit him down and make small talk.  Find a common interest and chat for a bit about it if you can.  3) Explain to him that you're concerned about his daughter.  That she is crying over the situation with religion and that it hurts you to see her upset.  Let him know that you're a decent guy who cares about her feelings.  Let him know that this may or may not be permanent (you're young, he'll respect that far more than any amount of ""This is love"" nonsense).  Let him know that you intend not to hurt her.  4) Ask him what he would do in your shoes.  If he liked a girl and the father didn't approve of belief or behavior.  If he begins bullshit about only believing in the church. Ask him how he gets along with his father-in-law.  Let the pause be long and awkward.  (No man truly gets along with his father-in-law).  5) Remind him that fathers being tough on boyfriends almost always pushes the daughter to find a far more edgy guy.  Let him know that you're concerned that she might leave you for someone who is truly bad, say a bishop's son who doesn't believe but hides it, or a long-distance online relationship.  Let him know that it is your common interest to let this relationship go its natural course.   Let him know that you respect him, and that you wanted to have a solid conversation with him about his daughter's best interest.  He may hate you.  He may still wish she never talked to you again.  He may fantasize about baptizing you and holding you under the water until the bubbles don't come up anymore... but he'll respect you.  And at the end of the day, that's all a boyfriend can ask from a GF's father, is respect.  If you've got that, the situation will calm down.  Trust is the next phase, and that won't come until after you have a child, maybe not even then.  But you can get respect, and by acting like an adult and meeting the lion in his own den, you'll get that.  Even if he yells like a baby and calls you names, he'll walk away unable to help but respect you.  And the next non-believer she dates/marries, he'll compare to you; who at least, he respected.

The fault rests on those who taught children to think this, and passes to the people who taught them that, all the way up to the man who pretends that he speaks with, and for, God.   I was racist, homophobic, incredibly sexist, and so fucking judgemental. I have never really been a hardcore TBM so I don't think I was a bad as others in my mission, but I still am not proud of who I was when I was at my strongest in the church.   I would say that 90% of straight, white Mormon men -- even if they weren't uber-TBM -- were probably this way. It was part of the culture that you were forged in.

Yes, it sucks.  It deserves a lot of grieving because it was a lot of time and a lot of effort.  The truth of what it is compared to the truth of what you thought is just a really awful comparison.    Most of us, I think, get to the point where we want to scream, ""What a WASTE!""  Because it is a horrible, horrible thing to waste any amount of your life and effort into such a useless thing.   But, in recognizing that you don't much like the person you were then, you are already becoming someone better, and that someone is definitely closer to your true self.  And that, you can celebrate.  WE celebrate with you!  In his Mormonstories interview, John Larsen said,  ""It is a gift to have been so wrong about something and to find out your mistake.  You will be a better judge for the rest of your life.""  (paraphrasing)  This helped me a ton, and made it easier for me to let go, and move on to the work of creating the life I want.

Here are some things you avoided by leaving when you did:  You didn't get married in the church and have to deal with potential fall out when you left.  You didn't raise kids in the church, or grandkids, or great grandkids.  You spent a very small percentage of your life believing and preaching something you now see as bad.  This will be one of many ""big"" and painful mistakes/learning experiences.  You'll get through this one and do good things because of it, and you'll get through future ones and do good things because of those.  That being said, is it much of a possibility to contact your converts and let them know?  This seems to help some missionaries even if it doesn't bring their converts out of the church.  When I left, I let my family know I left for many reasons, but I wanted them to know what I stood for as my testimony had always been a strong example and influence on many of them.  By letting them know I made an informed, intentional, and ethical decision to leave, they know it's a possibility for them if they decide to go there.  I made really awful, painful choices as a TBM (like your mission experience), that I cry about every single time I think of them even 4 years after I left.  I know I'll never stop being sad about those choices and that was one of the things that kept me in the church as long as it did.

It is true that he had little education. Examples of his writing are filled with spelling and grammatical errors. However, he was not dumb. In fact, he was very clever. And, most importantly, he was an excellent story-teller. He kept friends and family members enthralled for hours with his tall tales. Even though they knew they were made up, they found them enchanting.  So my theory is that he made all or nearly all of it up himself and perhaps filled in by asking questions of others. The fact that he finished the book in record time once he started ""translating"" again after the 116 pages were stolen is not impressive. He had had several years to come up with the narrative. All he had to do was get it out of his head and down on paper.

exmormon,3dwfyi,curious_mormon,62,Mon Jul 20 02:36:30 2015 UTC,"The reliance on the KJV actually goes a lot further than translation errors. One of the more interesting phenomena is words and phrases that are used only in a KJV context.  For example: the word 'pervert' appears ten times in the Book of Mormon. In every case, it appears in the phrase 'pervert the right ways of the Lord', as in Acts 13:10, regardless of the time period or author. What are the odds of that?  The word 'intents' is used three times. Every time i t appears in the phrase 'thoughts and intents of the heart', as in Hebrews 4:12.  'Manifestation' is used six times, every time in the phrase 'manifestation of the Spirit' as in 1 Corinthians 12:7.  There are actually over a hundred examples of this phenomenon. This is important, because this is actually one of the things that automated plagiarism software looks for. It's pretty much impossible to explain away."

exmormon,3dwfyi,Iamstuckathope,2,Mon Jul 20 13:46:47 2015 UTC,"You didn't ask me, but I don't think this is necessarily a smoking gun.   This issue, combined with many other issues is pretty damning though.  I've taught some university classes and it's very rare to come across a clear copy and paste job.   Usually people who do that are too lazy to even change the font, and they are just asking to get an F.  Most kids are smart enough now that they will just do a huge paraphrase of some concepts and then weave their own ideas throughout.     If this is an issue of new vocabulary, then it might not be plagiarism.  For example, if a student said ""quantitative easing"" a bunch of times in a paper about economic stimulus, I wouldn't see that as a red flag of plagiarism, even if their writing and analysis sucked.  The problem with the BoM is that you have phrases that are calling cards of the KJV in it.   The KJV was a translation of greek manuscripts done by scholars four hundred years ago.   The Book of Mormon, an 1820s translation of an ancient work, should not contain these calling cards.   It's kind of like finding a document that was supposedly written by Adam Smith in 1759 that talks about quantitative easing.    Those words shouldn't be there because they weren't used before the 1990s (and they were used to comment on actions taken by Japan's central bank).  But, for the sake of argument, lets say you found a paper written in 1759 by a Spanish economist and then translate it into English.   Is there any reason you would use the term ""quantitative easing""?   What if the Spanish economist had spoken about the idea of a central bank increasing the money supply to stimulate economic growth.  Would it make sense to use a trendy term like ""Quantitative Easing"" and attribute it to an economist from the mid 1700s?    No.  Such a choice would indicate you were writing a summary or providing commentary, not a translation.     Mark 3:5 says ""And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts . . .""  What an interesting phrase, ""hardness of their hearts.""      Nephi 15:4   And now I, Nephi, was grieved because of the hardness of their hearts, and also, because of the things which I had seen, and knew they must unavoidably come to pass because of the great wickedness of the children of men"

No. Such a choice would indicate you were writing a summary or providing commentary, not a translation.   I'm just playing Devil's Advocate here now but if you were okay with a 'loose' translation, I'm not sure how this isn't acceptable. When we learn about Adam Smith, we do so using supply and demand graphs that weren't invented for over 100 years later by Alfred Marshal. Arguably, because the modern reader is more familiar with graphs and such and so can comprehend Smith's original ideas better by seeing it in graph form rather than in Smith original language.  Potentially, readers/translators familiar with Biblical phrases might use the Biblical phrase to get get the same point across if the intent of the 'translation' was to get the points across in ways that readers would best understand it.  This defense, of course, still leaves the BoM with major problems as the above defense causes new contradictions. For example, there are many places where the BoM does not translate ideas into words that modern readers would understand such as having made up words for animals like 'cureloms.' So you end up using one method of translation for some phrases and a different method for other phrases and that starts to sound a lot like ""how Star Wars made me lose my Faith in God""  Also, I don't think this is a valid defense for KJV translation errors."
exmormon,3dwfyi,Iamstuckathope,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:24 2015 UTC,"You make a good point.  One additional problem with the ""loose"" approach is that it wasn't identified as loose.   We supposedly have direct records that were translated (Nephi and the like) and then we have abridged records, where Mormon will add commentary.  The text itself is clearly aimed at looking like a translation rather than a paraphrase.   If Joseph had made it clear that he used KJV language to make the translation more palatable, then I would be more accepting of the ""loose translation"" excuses.  Joseph could have even added content.    But I haven't heard of any contemporary source that indicates the translation was loose.   They all sold the BoM as a translation full of clear precedent."

exmormon,3dwfyi,AngelOfLight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:31:18 2015 UTC,"People tend to have different vocabularies. We have a set number of words and phrases that we use over and over again. This is part of what we call an author's 'signature'. Plagiarism software will analyze a person's vocabulary and phrasing, and come up with a statistical map that makes up that person's distinctive writing style. The software then looks for words and phrases at the low end of the probability map, in other words, words and phrases that are not used very often by a particular author. These are called 'statistically improbable phrases' (SIPS). It then compares those SIPS with the known writing of a different author. If there is a match, then we most likely have an instance of plagiarism.  The case is much stronger when an author uses two or more low probability words in the same phrase - and always only in that phrase. The probability that this would happen by chance is very low. It is far more likely that the phrase was copied from a different author."

Long story short, my wife wife was trying to use a ""we know"" message that the Book of Mormon was real and actually happened when talking to our son.  I piped up saying that I had proof was not what she claimed it to be.  My son stated that he wanted to see this proof (I love this kid), and I said okay.  I walked him through the KJV errors in conjunction with the translation method.  Her response was to use emotional manipulation (crying, lots of crying) and testimony to try and refute the evidence I've provided.  She simply said that she didn't know, but she looked forward to asking questions after she died. (So infuriating.  Ask them now, when you're alive and able to fix your life!)     Needless to say that infuriated me and I decided to come here to unload rather than doing it to them.  We do know.  We can prove this, but /u/mahershalahashtag is absolutely right that what we can prove is far less important to some (most?) TBMs than what they were indoctrinated with.  That's why brainswashing works.  That's why it will survive, in some form, even through the information age so long as someone is willing to brainwash their children (Teaching beliefs as fact, in an isolated environment, with no opposing view when the brain is developing, with social pressures to ignore evidence, supplied with lies to tell themselves when confronted with provable fact.)"

If you combine the story that Joseph saw two personages in the grove that fateful day, where one spoke and said, ""This is my son"", with the story that the English words would appear on the peep stones and would not disappear until the scribe had written them correctly, word for word, then how the fuck is the ""Son of"" God missed in every instance it refers to Jesus?    edit: It's my understanding that apologists claim Joseph may still have been laboring under the Trinitarian view at the time and that his understanding of the godhead ""evolved"".

Why would ""Son of"" have to be inserted into hundreds of BoM passages after the fact if Joseph already knew Jehovah and Elohim were two, separate personages?

It was a great hotel, but it was in an odd place. It wasn't church owned but they were the largest stock holder and financing was secured by prominent members. It largely catered to honeymooning newlyweds and visiting dignitaries, but also had a strong transient business for visiting Mormons due to its proximity to Temple Square.   It was a fairly successful business until the urban decay period of the 70s and 80s that was so common in the Western US. I remember it as a child. We even stayed there a few times. It was this big opulent hotel that had a bad smell, the showers sucked and everything felt dirty. It was not a nice hotel.   It finally went belly up and closed doors. The church I believe has first right of refusal on the purchase and gobbled that up real fast. It was on the national historic register, so they couldn't take it down, but the church needed more office space for the rapidly growing Family History Department.   Also, at the time Gordon B Hinckley was super skookem when it came to integrating media into the church. He felt that eye max was a big thing so he included the theater. Also, they needed to do something with the larger event spaces, so they built a ward house, a couple of restaurants, some event space and some touristy things to use protected space that wouldn't work well for office space.   Honestly, it was a pretty good use for the location. It would still be a bad spot for a hotel as traffic is awful. That's why the plaza hotel and the inn on temple square never did well. It couldn't have been torn down because of its protected status. So a group willing to take a some loss on the property was the perfect solution."

exmormon,3dxz8t,everything_is_free,4,Mon Jul 20 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"Prior to Juanita Brook's groundbreaking book The Mountain Meadows Massacre in 1950, the event was rarely discussed in southern Utah.   When Mormon historian Juanita Brooks was a young school teacher she was called to the bedside of a dying man. He had previously hinted to her that there was something terrible in his past, but never spoken of before, that he wished to get it out in the open. Now as he lay dying Brooks finally followed up on his request. When Brooks approached him he simply managed to cry out “Blood, blood, blood!” and then died. Brooks asked his family what it meant. They replied, “Didn’t you know?  He was at Mountain Meadows.”  The old man’s words haunted Brooks. She had grown up within only a few miles of the massacre site but this was the first time that she ever heard about the tragedy. As a result of this incident, Brooks began to research the massacre.  She faithfully researched the topic for nearly twenty years, quickly hiding her work and returning to the laundry and other household chores whenever visitors came calling.  This research culminated in  The Mountain Meadows Massacre published in 1950.  Up until this time conventional accounts had downplayed Mormon involvement in the massacre, pinning the crime primarily on the Paiutes and on Lee as an individual. Through her research, Brooks discovered a much more extensive Mormon involvement in the crime. She uncovered the direction of local leaders who ordered the massacre and investigated the involvement of the militia. She concluded that though Young “would have prevented it if he could, Brigham Young was an accessory after the fact.” She also gave some of the blame to Apostle George A. Smith who “did preach sermons and set up social conditions which made it possible.”    Since that time, the church and southern Utah locals have gradually been more and more open to discussing the massacre."

My MIL tried to bring it up at a family function once without knowing any better and Brooks was portrayed as a traitor by family members.
exmormon,3dxz8t,ElizaCochran,2,Mon Jul 20 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"The church, in many ways, was not yet ready for this open approach to the massacre.  Church President David O. McKay and his counselor J. Rueben Clark denied Brook’s request for access to those confessions and personal accounts that assistant church historian Andrew Jensen had collected 58 years before. Brooks was sharply critical of this decision. Her book also likely impacted her future church leadership prospects in the church. Though Brooks had once been president of the Stake Relief society (an extremely influential position, especially for a woman in a church mostly governed by an all male priesthood), after the publication of her work Brooks never again held any prominent positions in the church.   Like the Church, the Mormon people were also not quite ready to come to terms with the truth about the Massacre.  Brooks and her family were ostracized by their friends and neighbors in her small Mormon town. She later remarked that “this book branded me as an apostate.” This was a result of a people that were not yet ready to dig up the bones of Mountain Meadows, instead wishing the truth, whatever it may be, to remain hidden from the world. Nevertheless Brooks firmly believed that in exposing the truth behind the massacre she had “done a wholesome thing and done the church I love a service.”  Brooks’ research led church president David O. McKay to have a committee investigate the merits of Lee’s guilt. The committee recommended to McKay that Lee’s church membership be reinstated. McKay accepted the committee’s recommendation and in 1961 allowed one of Lee’s grandsons to be baptized via proxy for Lee. This decision was nothing less then an acknowledgment by church leaders, however tacit, that Lee had been unfairly made the sacrificial scapegoat for a crime whose primary guilt was born by a much larger collective.   Even so, the church was not yet ready to make this acknowledgment public.  Brook’s wished to include this information in a forthcoming biography of John D. Lee. As Brooks’ biographer Levi Peterson observed the decision to rebaptize Lee “was a personal vindication for Juanita, who for years had suffered a shadowy disgrace among her conservative friends and relatives for having espoused [Lee’s] cause.” When church apostle Delbert L. Stapley, head of the committee that had recommended Lee’s reinstatement, found out that she wished to include the fact of this rebaptism in her forthcoming book he requested to meet with her.  He told her not to reveal this fact and went so far as to threaten to rescind the rebaptism that he had recommended. Brooks persisted and published the fact Lee had been rebaptized anyway. Stapley did not make good on his threat but he did recommend that Brooks be excommunicated for this perceived insubordination.  When Church president David O McKay heard of this he told Stapley to “leave her alone.” It is also significant that Brooks remained a faithful Latter-day Saint through all of this.    This is all from an article I wrote on the subject here."

I went there last weekend did you go to the monument that lists the victims on a slab of granite? I unfortunately did not because I did not know it was there at the time. There are no signs that direct you to it. When you turn off the highway to go to the monument instead of following the sign that tells you to turn left and go to the main monument you go straight and at the end of the road there is a trail that you walk on that goes to a hillside with the list of the victims.

exmormon,3dxz8t,ZelphtheGreat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:58 2015 UTC,"I had two ancestors at the site.  The family NEVER spoke about it.  I had to read Brooks' book in secret due to feeling like I was committing some type of sin by exploring negative church history.  Her book was how I learned about family participation.  After I finished I asked my dad about it all.  He had a basic understanding, and shifted into full apologist mode, including historical settings, blaming the imigrants for poisoning the wells, blaming the indians, etc.  He heald the belief that the indians did the actual shooting, and the mormons simply cleaned up the mess.  I have always been amused that MMM is the ONLY historical event which will be discussed with any attempted historical context by TBM's, at least in my family.  If the shoe were somehow on the other foot all that we would hear about would be the poor faithful martyrs who sacrificed everything for the church - period.  Edit: My discovery happened around 1994.  At that time there was one memorial site up on the hill, which I asked my Dad to visit with me."

I just felt like all the YW should be getting that same kind of education I got at home and wasn't going to waste my time on something that I felt was not helpful to me in the slightest like reading scriptures and talking to a leader about what I learned.

I was the exact opposite of you - when my year came I was the only one who got it, and my mom was in the YW presidency. She kept trying to get me to put together a special display and they wanted me to speak at Standards Night and do a whole necklace presentation with the bishop, and I fought tooth and nail to not have to do it. I didn't even want my name on the plaque. I'm debilitatingly shy and hate being the center of attention, and I especially didn't want to be recognized for something that took practically no effort at all.  I lost that fight. I had to put up a display table, but the bishop and my mom both agreed that I wouldn't have to give a talk.   But then after he gave me the necklace up at the podium the bishop suddenly ""invited"" me to share my testimony with everyone. Basically shamed me into speaking, which was made all the worse by the fact that I was deeply struggling with my testimony and knew everything I was saying was a big fat lie.  I'm glad you got the recognition you wanted, but when I look back on the Personal Progress program I just feel ill."

Theres a reservoir nearby that you can go boating at. Tons of places you can go camping. Theres tons of cool parks. The Village is the coolest mall in the area.

exmormon,3duuyw,ctphoenix,136,Sun Jul 19 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"Well for a while I was flipping back and forth in my mind over a lot of topics. I guess what finally made everything concrete for me was this paragraph from the church's essay on Nauvoo polygamy:   When God commands a difficult task, He sometimes sends additional messengers to encourage His people to obey. Consistent with this pattern, Joseph told associates that an angel appeared to him three times between 1834 and 1842 and commanded him to proceed with plural marriage when he hesitated to move forward. During the third and final appearance, the angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.   Why the hell would god send an angel to command a dude to commit adultery, but not an angel to, I don't know, stop nuclear bombs from being dropped, end the holocaust, explain germ theory to people, reveal to the church that racism was bad, or prevent any number of horrible tragedies.   I just couldn't toe the line any longer that polygamy was so important that an angel had to threaten Joe with destruction to do it. That's just completely preposterous, and once I realized that everything else came crashing down."
exmormon,3duuyw,Leahona,50,Sun Jul 19 18:58:49 2015 UTC,"It's so fascinating to me to see what finally breaks people.  For me, I was in a new ward far away from family and previous friends, and after being uncomfortable there for weeks, I said to myself during sacrament meeting --- ""you know, if only I admit this to myself, I don't think any of this is really, actually true.  Maybe symbolically, but not really.  Oh well, I can never tell anyone.""  But I could not contain that realization --- it all unraveled for another year.  Is it possible that other factors lead people out of the church, and they just remember what they were thinking about when it finally happened?"
exmormon,3duuyw,vh65,38,Sun Jul 19 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely there can be other factors. I don't know if you've listened to any of the Infants on Thrones podcasts, but Randy has this idea of a ""believing brain."" Basically, the idea is that belief isn't a choice, we are just hardwired to believe or not to believe. At first, I thought that was just a ridiculous idea, of course belief is a choice. But I've been listening a lot to the You Are Not so Smart Podcast that is all about cognitive bias and the science of self delusion. I have really started to come around to the idea that we really aren't conscious of a ton of the factors that go into play about our decisions and beliefs. I can point to the story of the angel commanding Joe to commit adultery as the most solid contradiction in my mind right now, but there has probably been tons of stuff that has tripped up my brain to the point where I just can't believe it anymore."
exmormon,3duuyw,professional_giraffe,17,Sun Jul 19 20:17:09 2015 UTC,"I think Joseph's polygamy was such a big deal to me for a few reasons.

Intellectual reasons and facts matter a lot less than we usually think both in conversion and in deconversion, but we tend to overestimate their importance AFTER the event, in order to create a consistent narrative in our minds.  The whole thing can be though of like falling in love (conversion) and no longer loving someone (deconversion)."

Your post seems quite calm compared to how I felt at the outset. I felt a deep deep sense of betrayal. I had sacrificed my families treasure and blood. As a member of a bishopric I was party to implementing policies that were unkind and un-christlike. Betrayal is a powerful emotion. What was your experience in leaving after lurking?"

My wife and I don't have any children, and she has been pretty chill about our slow exit. She has different feelings than I do about god, but we both agree that the church is no good. I do wish I had invested all the money I've spent on tithing over the years. That would have been really nice. Honestly, right now I am still pretending to be a believer for my parent's sake. They have a ton invested in the church, and it would break their hearts if they knew how I truly feel. They are on a mission right now, and I get weekly updates on how the lord is blessing their lives.

But, seeing how the sausage was made etc etc not so much. HP callings, at least for me, is where you run head on into things that can create real ethical conundrums for you. Being expected to lie about church history/doctrine, serving on church courts that are fundamentally unkind, seeing people you know are terrible individuals (as you become privy to their past actions under color of the priesthood) called to be stake and mission presidents, etc. Once you blink and notice it all you find you are really up shits creek with what to do next."

exmormon,3duuyw,Lemons2002,3,Mon Jul 20 03:19:03 2015 UTC,"Actually I think it's a pretty typical pattern many of us go through in one form another. When core beliefs are challenged most anyone would double down on commitment via increased service/obedience, more ardent defence of the doctrine, apologetics etc.  I did the same kind of thing, I think many of us did.   It's not an easy thing to have your entire world paradigm ripped away, I think it's natural to grab on more tightly during that discovery process, you don't want to let go of it until you are absolutely sure about it. It's hard and scary to overhaul something so central to your world view and self identity. No one does it if there is doubt, they only give up on it when it's beyond doubt, it's just too painful and difficult a thing to do. It's natural to rationalize, justify, and defend it as best you can."

My former bishop kept emailing me and asking, ""But are you happier now?"" and I couldn't honestly answer ""Yes!"" because I really was NOT happier. I was instead angry and bitter... and even suicidal. Looking back, those years were important. The dark years made me understand better who I am and why ""happiness"" is not the most important thing in life. What good is it to be ""happy"" when it means you also have to shut your eyes to reality, when you have to overlook starving children and rape and corruption and lying so-called prophets? What I learned during those years is that it's better to be REAL than to he happy. I didn't take a single drink of alcohol or coffee until I felt REAL again. It's nice being REAL.

For me, I had already been out for a few years before I resigned my name...so the resignation gave me a sense of closure.      The guilt and shame is the indoctrination the church has instilled into you.    We all felt it at first.   It is usually when we do something the church said was a sin like drink alcohol or coffee, sex, etc. You are walking away from something that was a part of you and the church had their influence deep within your psyche so it will take time and you will go thru a variety of feelings.

exmormon,3dxx8j,ProphetOnandagus,3,Tue Jul 21 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty classic cog dis - the old doubts, fears, anxieties returning. Having open disapproval from the Bishop and your spouse is probably contributing the most to this.  Your head has been messed with for years. They told us how evil those who ""reject the prophets"" are, that you should never leave, that the temple is the one thing that can get you a spot with god, etc.  That kind of programming takes years to undo. It won't happen overnight. I've been out for a few years and I still feel guilty about stupid things from time to time. Those old fears and anxieties can be very hard to let go of. Having a spouse who is emotionally upset over your actions can be hard, but remember that her emotions are her responsibility. She's under that same influence. They're the ones telling her that you're not good enough because you don't play by their rules.  The good news is, you can let go of them, and you will feel better about it. That's where the real freedom is - realizing that you don't have to live by their asinine rules, realizing that they have no more power over your emotions or your mind.  Stay strong."
exmormon,3dxx8j,arkmabat,3,Mon Jul 20 17:16:40 2015 UTC,"I liked John Larsen's insight talking to John Dehlin:   The Church did this amazing psychological thing. What it did, is it convinced the members ...that if they left, their life would fall apart. They would be alone, they would be needy, they would get involved in substances... And then when people leave, they make sure that they leave them alone and isolated. So many people leave the church and insist to the world and to themselves that everything is OK because they know there are people waiting in the wings. I have had family members say...""after you left the church, we didn't want to give you any help...because we didn't want to promote your lifestyle."" And so there are so many people who get lost; who get drowned in that. But they don't want people to think they are suffering. Because to suffer would be to affirm what The Church says: that they are wrong. And so they're lying to themselves. They're lying to everyone and saying "" Everything is falling apart but I am OK.""  JD: And what's really happening? ...  JL: They've lost their support structure. They've lost their community. They've lost their family. They've lost their sense of purpose, their sense of being; [their sense of] what is going to happen to them...   Think about if you were to make another major life decision. What if you changed careers, or had a child, or joined the military, or left on a mission. You would talk about it with everyone you know. You would receive insight and support to help you through the process. Instead, all of us who walk away quietly do so without the natural feedback associated with community, family, and friends. Add to that the uncomfortable process of explaining to believers that you do not believe. It's no fun to tell kids that there is no Santa. You're right, but it still isn't a source of joy.   Your experience really resonated with me and my own experience."

It would be interesting to do something like this with the (in)fallibility of LDS prophets. Most TBMs behave as if their prophets are infallible, but the church's doctrine is that they're fallible. Usually TBMs only acknowledge that their prophets are fallible when presented with something disturbing that Joseph Smith or Brigham Young did. It would be interesting if you could get them to say they think prophets are infallible, and THEN tell them one of the Joseph or Brigham did."
exmormon,3dwb78,MissionPrez,7,Mon Jul 20 10:29:45 2015 UTC,This polygamist argument works on infallibility too. Are the brethren making a mistake by allowing falsehoods about Joseph (and his polygamous practices) to be written in these official essays?

After the vote, Smith stood and stated, ""I have thrown him off my shoulders, and you have again put him on me. You may carry him, but I will not.""

exmormon,3dy77v,Unmormon1,6,Mon Jul 20 14:47:41 2015 UTC,I agree. Modern Mormons forget or don't realize just how apocalyptic the early church was. That first generation or two really believed that Jesus was coming within their lifetimes. I think Joseph didn't care about succession because he figured Jesus was going to descend form the sky after Joseph was crowned King of the United States.
exmormon,3dy77v,TheNaturalMan,5,Mon Jul 20 15:52:47 2015 UTC,"From what I've read I think he told several people that they would be his replacement. By telling a bunch of followers that they were next in line they would only serve him more diligently and become more entrenched in his church/belief systems. He probably loved the fact that there were people vying to be his number 2. His dying and the saints fleeing to the west is probably what saved the church in the long run. Brigham was far less confrontational with the established power structures and he knew isolation would solidify his power. I imagine joe would have gotten weirder and more comparative as time went on, and I doubt he ever imagined the church without him as its leader."

The difference is obvious if you have felt it. There is no comparison.   But, I know for those who have not felt moral elevation in that way, when others talk about it, it can sound as stupid as basing your answers to existential questions on your acid reflexes.   Spirituality is a real part of human experience that deserves respect and serious answers. Spiritual experiences have real effects on the people that experience them that others will not readily notice about them. When mocked for something that he really did experience, the believer will learn an appreciation for scriptures like ""fools mock, but they shall mourn"" and have his beliefs solidified a little more."

exmormon,3dz2vb,soulure,2,Mon Jul 20 21:37:33 2015 UTC,"ColdDodger, you are very insightful and articulate.  Are you pursuing psychology?  Religious pathology?    You said:   How do you verify that those feelings aren't yours? You can't. It takes faith to believe that you aren't just deceiving yourself or being deceived by your indoctrination.   Absolutely right.  Religious faith is not just faith in God, faith in Christ, or even faith in prophets and apostles - it is faith in a particular interpretation of an emotional state.  My testimony was based on feelings:  feelings about stories I read and stories I was told;  feelings I anticipated having because I was taught to expect them;  feelings that others defined as meaning that the entire church was true; feelings that could not explain themselves;  feelings that did not return when a more complete truth about the church was known.    My loved ones would like me to ""remember my spiritual experiences"" and they claim they ""can not deny their own spiritual experiences.""  These comments are more than a little maddening to me.  I did not forget my past experiences;  I just found a different meaning in them.    I'd like to help my loved ones out of the cult.  More than anything, actually.  But you can't just adopt a different meaning to ""spiritual experiences"" - you have to work for it.  You have to discover other interpretations by understanding psychology - or at least by appreciating the power of the human mind to anticipate and create emotional states.  I think many more TBMs could break free of the cult if only they had the tools to unravel this knot.  You also said:   The fact that believers guard their most precious pearls with the most insecurity tells me that despite the significance they try to imbue these experiences with, they seem to know intuitively that it could just be happenstance and delusion.   Sadly, I think you are exactly right.  Many know the flimsiness of their faith, but they feel chained to the faithful interpretation of their ""spiritual"" experiences.  Maybe they fear damnation.  Maybe they fear the pain of calling the sacrifices they've made (for their faith) worthless.    You concluded:   . . . I’ve always been wary of people who insist they have a perfect knowledge without flinching –– there has to be something, at least an element of uncertainty in their experience, that they are being dishonest about . . .    This intrigues me because I once fell more solidly on this side.  I believed President Packer's description of ""spiritual knowledge"" and I thought that's what I had.  Was I deceiving myself all along?  I was certainly assigning a particular meaning to my experience, and that meaning was fully colored by the indoctrination I had internalized.  I was deluded.  But I think I was honestly deluded.    I could admit that if I was not born a member, I would not believe in the church.  I could admit that I would not expect any rational person to believe in the church or convert.  But I still thought that God had spoken to me, and told me the church was true in the sense that the ordinances and the priesthood and the power were all very real and true.  And because He had spoken to me, I could not backtrack or ""deny"" that ""revelation.""  This was the double bind I was in as a believer - until I found a different meaning in those ""spiritual experiences.""    Maybe the key to breaking people out of the church's psychological trap is to give them the key to understanding their spiritual experiences differently.  I wish there was an easy way to do that."

Why would Elohim and Jehovah regret having to baptize the earth? Maybe they regretted the fact that all of those people would be stuck in spirit prison until Jesus died. But then, why did Elohim wait so long to send Jesus to death? Why not do it earlier in the plan?  Was it planned beforehand that Jehovah would come to earth when he did, or was the timing an adjustment of the plan? Was there ever a chance that the Israelites might not have been led into captivity or that they would have welcomed Jehovah when he arrived? If so, who would there have been to crucify Jesus?"

exmormon,3dy452,k_space,5,Mon Jul 20 14:10:39 2015 UTC,"Okay, the Carthage ""Mob"" was made up of a lot of people.  Thomas Sharp and about 150 men from the Warsaw Militia marched 80 miles to Carthage.  Men who were injured by Joseph Smith's Gunfire so they had to be present: John Wills was shot in the arm; William Voras was shot in the shoulder; and William Gallaher was shot in the face Wills, Voras, Gallaher, and a Mr. Allen (possibly the fourth man) were all indicted for the murder of Joseph and Hyrum. Wills, Voras, and Gallaher, perhaps conscious that their wounds could prove that they were involved in the mob, fled the county after being indicted and were never brought to trial.  Thomas C. Sharp, Mark Aldrich, William N. Grover, Jacob C. Davis and Levi Williams (Head of the 59th regiment of the Illinois Militia) —were tried for the murder of the Smiths. All five defendants were found not guilty by a jury.  Some details about the prominent nature of these men with the Warsaw Masonic lodge  However it is worth noting that the Warsaw Lodge lost it's charter over these men:   In an apparent effort to garner public support, the defendants attempted to find refuge in the Warsaw lodge while awaiting trial.  To the Fraternities credit, the Grand Lodge of Illinois called the Warsaw lodge to an accounting for its actions. The following describes the circumstances.  ""In the meantime, the defendants were apparently trying to strengthen their position by new allegiances within the influential Masonic order. Mark Aldrich was a member of Warsaw Lodge No. 21, founded in January 1843. With an immediacy and urgency that cannot have been coincidental,  Jacob Davis, Thomas Sharp, and Levi Williams were all initiated into the small Warsaw Lodge in October and December 1844.  Before spring all three had been passed to the second degree, and Davis and Williams had been raised to Master Masons.  How much advantage the defendants expected to derive from this association is unclear, though it is a fact that many of the most influential men in the County and State at this time were Masons.  The list includes Justice Richard M. Young of the Illinois Supreme Court, who was to be the judge at the trial; James H. Ralston, former states attorney; Judge Stephen A. Douglas; former circuit judge O. C. Skinner, who was to be among the defense counsel at the trial; George W. Thatcher, the anti-Mormon clerk of the county commissioners court; and various members of the Warsaw Militia, such as Charles Hay, Henry Stephens, and several of the Chittenden family.  ""Whatever uncertainties may exist in the benefits the defendants expected to derive from their Masonic affiliation, there is no doubt that the state officers in the Masonic order identified an impropriety in this maneuver and took decisive disciplinary action. In its annual meeting in 1845 the Grand Lodge of Illinois appointed a select committee to investigate reports that the Warsaw lodge had violated Masonic regulations by conferring degrees upon persons who were under indictment.  In response to this investigation, officials of the Warsaw Lodge admitted that the degrees had been conferred on Davis, Williams, and Sharp, but pleaded that the men in question were 'worthy members of society, and respected by their fellow citizens.' Their standing in the community 'had not been at all impaired by the indictment, but, on the contrary, they were regarded with greater consideration than before, from the fact that they had been particularly selected as the victims of Mormon vengeance.' The Grand Lodge was apparently unimpressed with the defense.  A year after this report was submitted, the Warsaw Lodge surrendered its Charter, ostensibly because 'the members of Warsaw Lodge No. 21 have no suitable room to work in...' This voluntary relinquishment of a Charter because of supposed housing shortage in Warsaw was undoubtedly a face-saving disposition in lieu of involuntary suspension for violation of regulations of the order."" http://phoenixmasonry.org/freemasonry_and_mormonism.htm   The key thing to realize is that Warsaw, Missouri only had a population of about  500, and so having 150-200 men march; it must have been nearly impossible to find anyone for the Jury who had not been involved in the march to Carthage (or a spouse/child of someone who marched)"

exmormon,3dy452,Mlawksh,2,Tue Jul 21 00:39:45 2015 UTC,"The Kirtland ""mob"" wasn't just disgruntled members.  Some evidence points to the fact that the Johnson's, who led the mob, were motivated by Joseph's alleged sexual impropriety with Marina Johnson (who, maybe not so coincidentally, became one of Joseph's plural wives later on).  Evidence for this is supported by the fact that the incident took place in the middle of the night which suggests a crime of ""passion,"" as well as the fact that Dr. Dennison was there to allegedly castrate Joseph, which is usually a punishment reserved for sexual predators.  See this article by Grant Palmer for more info: http://mormonthink.com/grant6.htm  As to the mob at Carthage, not much is known about the actual people, unfortunately.  If you take the 5 people who were actually tried and acquitted for his murder, however, you may conclude the mob was NOT made up of former members (none of the 5 that were tried were ever mormons).  A good starting place is this wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Joseph_Smith#Injuries_to_mob_members) where, under the heading ""Responsibility and Trial"" you can link to the biographies of the 5 people tried for his murder.  You'll see that they were all labelled ""anti-mormon"" (most people in Illinois were...) but none of them were ever actually mormon.  As for the rest of the mob, there's no way to tell.  Probably Illinois militia, given that most of the men tried for the murder were militia leaders accused of calling up the militia to murder Joseph.  But again, that's just a guess."

exmormon,3dxl26,dante2810,4,Mon Jul 20 13:30:08 2015 UTC,"I'll throw out another possibility- maybe he believed it. We know Joseph was charismatic. We know he could talk the knickers off a nun. We know he was a gifted storyteller. Is it such a stretch to believe he could have listened to Joseph's dictation and actually have believed God was behind it?  Lawyer and teacher notwithstanding, Oliver was a rodsman... he believed he could use a magic stick to find things (like water). I don't think that his own personal conviction is too much of a stretch.  At least he had the integrity to walk away after seeing Joseph porking Fanny Alger, which is more than most members today can say, even after learning that Joseph had, as an apologist would say, a rather nuanced way of showing loyalty to Emma."
exmormon,3dxl26,GeorgePWashburn,4,Mon Jul 20 13:35:08 2015 UTC,"Cowdery was almost certainly a co-conspirator. When he showed up, the BoM translation pace increased by an order of magnitude.  He also claimed (or allowed Joseph to claim) to be present for the priesthood restorations, which of course didn't occur. He stood to gain the most of anyone next to Joseph, and held the title of assistant president of the church until his excommunication.  It's possible he was an extremely devout, pious, and credulous fool and simply allowed Joseph to convince him to go along with falsehoods for the greater good - but I think it more likely he was in in it.   That said, I do think his revulsion toward polygamy and his general belief in Christianity was sincere. But his deathbed return to Mormonism shows that his sincerity and principles only ran so deep."
exmormon,3dxl26,AintYoMomoNoMo,4,Mon Jul 20 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"David Whitmer started his own church.  He had motive to lie, but was a very honest person.  Detailed investigation shows that he saw them with spiritual eyes, but never denied that.  Martin Harris bore testimony of the Quakers more than he did of the Book of Mormon.  He never denied that testimony either.  He did head west eventually to Utah, but stayed behind, not following Brigham originally, but baring testimony of James Strang, whom he also never denied testimony of.  Oliver Cowdery's legal partner said that he confessed that Joseph and He has used the Spaulding Manuscript to create the Book of Mormon.  Oliver died at David Whitmer's home, but it was clear he wanted to get to the Utah church at the time of his death.  He did deny that Joseph was a prophet for a few years (In fact in was put into a hymn).  Of the eight witnesses, the Whitmers, not surprisingly followed David Whitmer's church.  William Smith was vehemently against the LDS movement.  Rigdon decried Joseph as burning in Hell for polygamy, and started his own church.  He, too, never denied the Book of Mormon but had his entire livelihood dependent upon it.  Each has their own motive.  Each was trying to position themselves in a seat of power with the splintered churches all of which depended upon the Book of Mormon.  Oliver is the interesting one; having called Joseph an adulterer, said Joseph was a fraud, and left, at the end of this life his law partner tells of a secret confession, and yet he is clearly investigating the different church schisms at the time of his death.  But it is anything but as cut and dried as the LDS church makes it sound that ""none of them ever gave up their testimonies"""
exmormon,3dxl26,Mithryn,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:42 2015 UTC,Did they insist it was real or just not recant their testimony?

exmormon,3dxl26,joe_sausage_smith,3,Mon Jul 20 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"They didn't, at least not entirely.  Possible reasons why they wouldn't just outright and clearly say it:    It was a safety net (see Cowdery).  When all else failed, they returned to the church/built a new church for a moderate living.  Danites.  Illegality and risk of exmormons suing them for fraud.   Crazy members wanting vengeance (the gun toting kind). Reputation.  It's one thing to be fooled by a charlatan.  It's quite another to be that charlatan."
exmormon,3dxl26,curious_mormon,3,Mon Jul 20 16:42:55 2015 UTC,"Don't you find it strange how the translation dragged on for so long and then when Oliver shows up the translation starts up again and moves along very quickly.  Oliver was Josephs cousin, he was well educated and his paster was Ethan Smith the author of ""View of the Hebrews"".  Oliver was just as guilty for the book of mormon as Joe was and he was probably terrified to admit he was in no the con and found it easier to claim the lie true then suffer the wrath of being a conman"

It's also possible that they didn't want to admit they couldn't see them, kind of like the Emperor's New Clothes, and didn't so much think they were committing fraud as just not wanting to admit they were unworthy to see them.  Or maybe they knew there weren't plates but believed the Book of Mormon was divine and that weaker people would need to believe in plates to accept it.  Or maybe they just wanted to start a religion with Joseph, were excited to be in on the ground floor, and didn't recant their testimony because they all wanted to continue benefiting from the operation, either within the church or with their own spin-off churches.  Remember that Joseph gave the witnesses, especially the 3, a special status.  They got to choose the 12 apostles.  We'll never know which of those it really was, but they're all much more probable than the faithful version."

I commend you for following through with all of your preparation.    In my mind it always played out with the authorities bearing their testimony to me that I needed to go have faith and keep praying and then attending church and praying and reading the scriptures.  I knew that because that's what I would have done if I was in the authority position.  It's absurdly disingenuous to people trying to look for evidence and facts.  It's completely bigoted to behave that way as well.    Your bishop sounds like they confide in you and he has definitely has been extremely civil and open minded with you.  I guess I just didn't have a good relationship with my bishop at the time I left, Bc I had been moving around a lot for work.   What boils my blood is that there are people in the church that will not even consider that it MIGHT be false or fraudulent.  No way Jose.  That must be the devil speaking.  At least that's what they teach.   It amazes me that these leaders are not aware of the inconsistencies and discrepancies in the Mormon history, story of the early church and with Joseph Smith.   I guess I kind of understand why- maybe they never have wanted to dig that deep because they are scared to think of the possibility of what they might find.  I knew I was at first.  Eventually the small things that I did find out about Joseph smith and the first vision started eating away at me, to the point where I had to find out more.    Church history is a massive train wreck of lies, fairy tales, empty promises, deception, myth, magic and stupidity, however a sub par social club.  15-25 years from now when all of the geriatric-hard core-set-in-their-ways Mormons pass on, things will be different.  I didn't really have the glaring information easily accessible about church history (ie the Internet, church doctrine, journal of discourses, novels about church history) until 2005 - at least for me- and onward.   I remember talking to my brother about inconsistencies he had learned from his friends around 2007/2008.  Obv the Internet has been around since early 90's-  '96, but it wasn't as enriched with informational websites on such specific topics- BUT I could be wrong about that.   Now- it's game over for the church if you want to research the reasons as to why it is not credible.  Super easy.  How could you not?  Isn't that information important?"

She told me he was busy.  I told her that if I didn't get a letter from SLC saying I was officially out, then I would contact every Baptist church in the area, and offer to give a fireside expose about the Mormons, the wackadoodle temple ceremony, the danites, mountain meadows slaughter, adam-god and countless other little gems.

exmormon,3dwsms,EmmaHS,11,Mon Jul 20 04:43:27 2015 UTC,"One more thing that the church has managed to mangle. The program is meant to take 5 - 7 years to achieve eagle. But somehow in the church everyone manages to do it in less than 2.  Quite simply, they cheat and it's encouraged by the church. I was once asked to teach a class for a ""merit badge clinic"". One of the requirements of the badge was a project over the course of at least 2 months. The scout leaders were upset because I wouldn't sign off of the badge and count the 2-hour class as their 2-month project."
exmormon,3dwsms,421226af16c9b2419573,4,Mon Jul 20 13:12:20 2015 UTC,"Absolutely this.  In any non-LDS scout troop kids usually end up getting their eagle around 18.  Merit badges take longer than one weekend to complete, yet LDS scouts can go on a weekend campout and come home with seven merit badges.  Your absolutely right.  They cheat."

They flat out told me all the ways I should bend the requirements to get it done. Things like put each boy in their own patrol so that they can each be their own patrol cook for the camp outs.  Seeing how the church bastardized scouting helped me with my exit, because it added so much to my frustration with the church, and made me examine my shelf earlier than I may have otherwise."

I could have been in the troop in my ward, but we luckily had one that was closer to us than the ward troop, so I was able to convince my parents to let me join that one.  I BARELY managed to get my board of review done before my 18th birthday, and get the Court of Honor the day before my birthday.

They sent a response to that one informing me my membership had been terminated December 26, 2014. That was the only communication I ever received from them.

Not all women should be stay-at-home moms. Just like not everyone should be in the Mormon church. I hate the ""one-size-fits-all"" bullshit of the church. It's arrogant and destroys the individual.

They all act like kids are the best and that motherhood is the single greatest gift and that they are the absolute epitome of Mormon Motherhood - but every single one of them is on antidepressants, all of them physically and emotionally abused us, and we could not be more fucked up as human beings. They should NOT have been mothers. They should have been CEOs, Colonels, human rights attorneys, but they were forced to give up their potential for this cult. I turn 30 this year and the idea of being ""old enough"" for a child is still absurd. I would have killed myself or worse (much,  much, much worse) if I would have been stuck with kids at 22. I was so far gone as an individual, I was NOT a stable or healthy person. I see my cousins, especially my little TBM sister cousins who are assholes to their spouses and their kids,  but everyone smiles and is so proud.

They were absolutely miserable.. leaving church in tears on a regular basis. When I addressed it with leadership and was ignored and ignored and... ignored... I realized that the church is just not a good place for my family to be. Afterward, I found this site and my subsequent research has made me very aware of what a crock of shit the whole thing is, and how I am now responsible to do damage control and help my older children learn that they were taught a bunch of BS at church. I am so glad that my younger children are out before they'll really remember and I'm so glad that my older children are out before any of them invested too much time in their adult life (missions) or money in this nonsense organization. Even though I always struggled with having a testimony, I did eventually receive my endowment. I went to the temple several times (and everytime I felt like I was in that underground church scene from one of the planet of the apes films...) and I do still have a temple recommend, although I have no desire to ever return. The last time I went I slept through most of the endowment. At that point I realized I had heard all there was to hear in there (I was curious :/ )... now I struggle with some guilt for having my dead relatives' names in the temple and for bringing my kids into this church in the first place. I guess that will pass with time. Hopefully."

exmormon,3dvp81,JoanBranin,11,Sun Jul 19 23:11:18 2015 UTC,"I think one cause is that people on reddit are assumed to be male unless stated otherwise.

So when a person posts on /r/exmormon, a casual reader may assume that person is male and say things like ""I applaud you, sir""!

When I finally removed my garments and stopped forcing myself to attend to church a huge weight was lifted. I no longer had to contend with the church's lies and half truths.

Despite both of them repeatedly being disrepectful, bullying my little brother, stealing, and running away, she would always take them back talking about how we needed to care for those that had less/be righteous examples/etc.etc . Well one day i expressed my pain, frustration and anger to my mother, as a blood daughter. Her response?  "" you need to pray about changing your attitude and character and accept these girls as more than your spiritual sisters. I have prayed long and hard and know they are supposed to be in this family.""  That didnt go as well as she expected.  Extra kicker: i official resigned a month ago and my sister (who reaply supports my mom in a lot of ways) accused me of disrespecting my family by leaving and not giving the church a true chance and that ""blood is all we have left in the end on this earth"".

And I see what that does to him. I tried to let bygones be bygones, but I hated it the longer I let things be.

I was petrified of nursery and primart, I vocally challenged things that were wrong  and ignored many taboos and such to get my point across. Ultimately, though, it was my parents' divorce my senior year (a relief!). My pious TBM mother suddenly tasted reality - she left home at 18, was engaged the following June and by the next December she was married. Fast forward 25 years and she's a single, unemployed woman with no education, no financial history, no bank account of her own, not a single account that wasn't  in my dad's name with her as the joint name. More importantly, her whole life had been about my dad (for ETERNITY! that is her belief - she has sworn never to unseal him) and us kids, and the church.  My dad was now gone, I graduated, and the youngest was shortly to leave the nest. My mother suddenly had no life except the church, which (despite appearing to support her by assuming my dad was the problem) made her feel like shit because her faith  clearly hadn't been strong enough, etc. Also horror stories. I did not know a SINGLE female who was even content, let alone happy. Every single woman I knew had compromised, felt oppressed, and about 50% of them hated their spouses (many of whom were openly having affairs, yet maintaining their priesthood callings), which makes sense considering most of them marry as teenagers who have never even been allowed to have male friends, let alone boyfriends, and have no idea who they are or who their partners are. Frankly, growing up LDS was traumatic. I always felt terrified of church, church people, all of it. I developed violent outbursts of crying and rage, debilitating anxiety, an eating disorder (weighed 104 before I started grad school and properly questioning the brainwashing - I am now steadily at 130 and can't believe I ever weighed less than this, though still simultaneously feel ""fat"" because I was trained to be obsessed with my shameful, dirty vessel of sin! Lol) was repeatedly victimized by predatory patriarchs who knew that I would have no recourse if I reported them because no matter the circumstances I would be blamed for it, etc. Every woman was silenced, pushed aside, and used for manual labor and sex. Every single  experience in church was awful! These puffed-up, prematurely-middle-aged, out-of-shape simpletons who ruled us would stand by in their over-stressed suit coats watching their wives and (eachothers' daughters) while they (The Sisters) set up/took down tables and chairs,  joking about  how lucky Brother Assclown is because his wife, Sister Definitely-Married-Beneath-Her, ""got her figure back, for the most part."" I objected to the idea that, should I marry in the temple, I would not be able to invite my brother, my father, my cousins (all of whom were ex Mo or never mo, and who I was closest to in my life) or even my pious, perfect, obedient, 100000000% ""worthy"" cousin who hadn't yet taken out her endowments (because she was unmarried, hadn't gone on her mission, and was discouraged, as was I before I left, from taking them out because they wanted us to be married). I could rant for days, literally. It was a horrifying experience, and it took me years to sleep without night terrors  (had nightmares so bad as a kid - various scenarios, all about being kept prisoner, and NEVER being able to speak/cry out for help - that the neighbors on base called the military police to investigate because I was screaming in such fear). I can't believe how many people were able to get good experiences out of this institution."

I hated that feeling of doubt, and how difficult and unsatisfactory it was to try and browbeat my subconscious back into unquestioning obedience and faith.  There was also a healthy (or, rather, unhealthy) amount of anxiety and self-hatred regarding my sexuality; I had never masturbated--to the point where I couldn't bear to even figure out where my vagina was in order to use tampons, lest I instantly become a sex addict the moment I touched myself down there without a shield of three layers of toilet paper-- but I had read a few dirty novels and fanfiction, and I just writhed with self-hatred and shame every time I ""backslid"" and let myself think about sex in any way.  And eventually, I just got sick of it.  I was so, so tired of pretending that I like church, or that I thought it was true, or that it was anything other than a gigantic crock of shit.

I woke up the next morning and it was still bothering me and then everything came crashing down on me. Worst. Feeling. Ever.   I'm forever grateful I have the husband I do. I went to him that morning just in tears over everything and he just hugged me and promised it would all be ok, that he wouldn't rush me, but that he was there for me 100%. That man is my rock. I couldn't have gotten through that to where I am today without him. I would have just stayed and been miserable."

exmormon,3dvp81,texasflower,5,Mon Jul 20 05:19:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of reasons. Growing up in YW I was never the giggly huggy warm and fuzzy girl like the others. I never wanted kids, but my religion taught me that I HAD to be a mother, and so I would try and make myself like them.   Then I lost my virginity at 18. Now I'm a chewed up piece of gum/rotten apple/ licked cupcake and no good man will ever want anything to do with me! This haunted me until I met my husband when I was 23. I had several healthy sexual relationships over the years, never with TBM dudes, because I assumed they would be offended by some lowly nonvirgin like me.  I came back to the church and repented and all that good stuff. I met my husband and I was shocked when I confessed that I was not a virgin and he was like ""Well, at least one of us would know what we're doing."" Haha. He was a keeper. But we had kind of a traumatic experience when we were married, as his bishop tried to intervene just days before the wedding because he decided my hubby owed tithing. 2 days before the wedding (he had traveled all over the country for work that year and didn't go to that ward, but I guess it didn't matter.) he called us in and sat us down and told us that we needed to call off the wedding, and only tell people invited to the temple ceremony and then throw a reception and pretend like we did for everyone else. Say whut. Long story short we DID end up getting married as planned thanks to some connections but were stunned and hurt. It was amazing to us that this man had the kind of power to potentially make us call off our wedding NOT because of our worthiness, but because of the money.   After that ordeal it didn't take much for us to look at things a bit more skeptically and come across the CES letter. We learned that it's all a bunch of lies and bullshit, and our kids are never going to go through the shaming we've endured throughout our lives and drama of what was supposed to be the happiest memory in our life together.   I've also always had issues with their treatment of the LGBT community. One of my best friends in high school was gay, and it never made sense to me why he shouldn't marry someone he loves, or is at LEAST attracted to."
exmormon,3dvp81,madepenn,2,Mon Jul 20 04:47:41 2015 UTC,Wow and WTF!  Did your husband end up paying the tithing?  That story!  Wow.
exmormon,3dvp81,girl0nwire,3,Mon Jul 20 05:17:17 2015 UTC,"No he offered at the meeting but the bishop said no, as it didn't count then. It was purely a personal thing, in my opinion. The bishop's wife recently had a falling out with my MIL and he was just that kind of dude I guess. I posted the full story a few months back, you can probably find it in my post history. We were able to get married because his SP happened to be sitting in for it that night and intervened. Pretty wild stuff though."

exmormon,3dvp81,Meep1996,5,Mon Jul 20 06:19:00 2015 UTC,"so my story is pretty similar to previous ones.  short story  it was toxic.  im not gonna raise kids the way i was raised. even if my mom thinks we won't see each other in heaven, im not gonna mold my life the way she wants.   i spent most of the time in the religion wishing i hadnt been born in it so i could escape the crushing guilt of not believing it or wanting it.  in the end, it's all so confusing and awful it made me wanna sit somewhere and cry.   long story  so i was born in the church.  my mom converted at 13 and has been active ever since. i was her first child at 20 as she was married at 18. my dad is your average emotionally stunted TBM. he  neglected and abused my mom and his 6 kids. after a parasitic marriage, they separated. during the separation, my parents both cheated on each other. i was just entering highschool and i was the only one to find out about their affairs.   this burden started my most major issues. when my parents did divorce, rumors spread about my mom's cheating but not my dad's. and my YW leaders treated me and my sisters like we were about to grow three extra heads at any moment because 1. we were children of divorce and the idea of 'eternal families' was shattered for us and 2. our mom was a supposed whore, so we must be in need of some ""real mothering"".  i kept sneaking out of mutual on Tuesday nights because i felt so alone and depressed every damn time we had to discuss spirituality. it felt like someone was loading rocks into my chest.  my friends always said i was a ""hybrid"" when it came to mormon girls. mostly because i was independent, but not enough to swear, rebel, or dress ""immodestly"". although, a lot of restriction came from living with my pious mother who went a little crazy after the divorce because of the extreme degree of isolation she was put through by the other women. she took it out on the kids alot of the time.  to me, my mom said gems like ""the devil will find your weakness and take you away from us."" and ""if you leave the church there will be an empty chair at our family table in heaven.""  my mom put me through alot as a kid/young adult and the ""happy family"" mask we all had to wear to church was very unhealthy. i was packing away mountains of depression until i drove me to several suicide attempts that my family is still unaware of.    so, my personality just didn't meld with the church i was too sad and too aware of stuff.  but i still went to early-morning seminary. i found a half-comfort there in the soft and fuzzy things like the promised afterlife....but there were so many sharp insults to my intelligence that i just couldn't get past.  i remember my more liberal acquaintances in high school suddenly coming up to me and saying ""i want you to know, we can't friends anymore because you don't allow gays their rights."" and then walking away. i knew i was supposed to have this rush of righteousness toward them, that i was supposed to whip out the BoM and """"""show them the way"""""", but all i could think was ""well i'm not denying anyone their rights!...am i?""   but hearing those words to my face made me realize that if opposing the LGBT community felt wrong, it probably was. and i needed to stop opposing humans getting their human rights. i realized i was on the wrong side of history.  developing these independent thoughts was like cracking the dam.   another incidence was when someone was chatting online with me about the church and they said something like ""gay kids and trans kids kill themselves every day because of people like you. you are a murderer."" before signing off and i was left there with shock.  that chock turned to shame and disgust and it spread in my heart for not only myself but my entire  family, peers, and especially the church leaders. it made me feel like i had done so much damage just by existing.  and then there was the race issues. these blew my mind. i didn't even know these things  until my teen years. i'm pretty sure if i knew these things when i was 8 i would've said no to getting baptized even then.  black people were denied the priesthood. this is often swept under the rug OR sugar coated with the fact the ""word of God changed with modern times"" (????).   but then i figured out that since black people were denied the priesthood they were also denied their chance to get married in the temple with their spouse and by mormon standards means they're not going to have eternal families.  i was so mad about this i told my mom my qualms and she responded with silence. it still rings in my ears how she turned a blind eye to that. all i can hope is that it'll sit in her head.  that's when i stopped going.  the nail in the coffin, though, was me dating my non-member boyfriend. i knew i loved him and i would be with him for the rest of my life but it wasn't something i could share with my family. i moved in with my non-member grandma (who was a God-send) but i kept going to church. it was for myself, to see if i was really going out of routine or because i needed it.  but every sunday i would feel this guilt that kept building and building, telling me that i needed to break up with my boyfriend because he was going to make me leave the church eventually because if i went with him i was going to ""let go of the rod"".   sitting there in church, i couldn't imagine making my boyfriend convert but the idea of leaving the church was EXTREME TABOO as my life supposedly held a future of raising more mormon kids.  the problem was that i rarely spoke of the church to my boyfriend because i was so ashamed. when i did mention it to him, he was politely against it. so after 2 years i had a breakdown where i said how i was so ready to move across the country to be with him but i was scared because i knew deep down i'd stop going to church. i said that if i stopped going, i didn't know if we'd be together in the afterlife and if we had kids they couldn't be sealed to me and he couldn't give them blessings...etc..etc...  and he was so understanding. he said if i needed to break it off to pursue my faith, he would understand. he was in tears and cried every day with me those two weeks we were struggling with it.   but then i realized nothing added up. nothing about the church added up at all. the little things i liked about the church, the comforting things...all got knocked down so easily."

exmormon,3dvp81,icamom,2,Mon Jul 20 03:17:29 2015 UTC,I read that!  It was awesome.  Well-done.  I was so torn about shaking my bishop that I didn't go into my reasons when we left.  Sometimes I regret that.  Other times I shudder at the memory that he delved into my sex life with my husband and then I'm just happy I don't think of him often.
exmormon,3dvp81,proudlittletare,4,Mon Jul 20 05:35:38 2015 UTC,"The temple rituals, especially the strange handshakes/tokens. I am 24 now, I was 20 when I left. Thankfully I had never gone to the temple other than for baptisms for the dead. I can't imagine how I would have reacted if I had already been married in the temple and then told I had to do those things. I think leaving when I did has been my saving grace, before I invested a marriage and family into the church. I am so thankful for the few exmormons who put undercover videos up on YouTube of temple rituals. Giant punch in the face that I was part of a cult.   The nail on the coffin was Joseph Smith. I knew after just a little research into reputable sources he was an impostor. Specifically after reading about the Kinderhook plates. Great piece of history that, surprisingly, had never been brought up before.   Thanks for asking, OP. I love when women can bring up and support one another :)"

When I complained about my feelings to my atheist brother, he just said ""Isn't the point of the church to become a very specific kind of person though?"" He had a valid point and I was disturbed at the thought of being assimilated.   Around the same time, I became aware of a modern-day fledgling cult leader named Christopher Nemelka. He claimed to have translated the Sealed Portion of the Book of Mormon through his relationship with Advanced Human Beings. I found his truth claims both absurd and entertaining. As I followed Nemelka's antics, I had to ask myself what distinguished Nemelka from Joseph Smith. In the end, I realized they were both con men."

It took us nearly two weeks to hear back from them.) so I was a bit tender, to say the least. I went over the 5 minute time limit, and although no one said anything at the time, the next opportunity I had to speak one of the bishopric reminded me that youth speakers only needed to fill about five minutes. I wanted to kick him in the throat. I gave a PERFECT talk, and refused to ever speak in church again. For the most part the next few years was an uneventful slow fade, and I ignored most of my frustration because I had no choice but to do the minimum. Right after I graduated h.s. they assigned me a ""calling"" to nursery. Initially I thought it was a temporary thing until a better position for leadership opened up - my next calling was to the sunbeams. I went home that day and didn't even acknowledged the church again for years. No contact, not even a ""I can't accept this calling"" phone call. Fuck them.  tl;dr - Crying during a talk in church led to my escape from said church. Fuck them."

exmormon,3ductv,WHITE_WALKER_BABIES,30,Sun Jul 19 15:44:44 2015 UTC,"Issue 5: Lack of gender equality in the church  What I was taught and my first impressions of the church  Before I joined the church, I was impressed by the fact that women spoke in Sacrament Meeting and taught Sunday School and Relief Society lessons, just as men gave talks and taught their classes and lessons. I thought that women and men were treated as equals and had equal opportunities for leadership. The missionaries taught me that men and women were considered equal in the sight of God and the church.  What I later learned  I learned before I joined the church that women could not hold the priesthood. At first this didn’t bother me a whole lot, because growing up Catholic, very few men were even priests, so it didn’t seem like a noticeable inequality. However, after a short while, I realized that priesthood is granted to every worthy male in the Latter-day Saint church, so the inequality between men and women is a much bigger gulf than I initially thought.   I learned that women can’t officially give blessings, even to their own children, but in the early church they were able to do so. Women cannot be bishops, stake presidents, apostles, or prophets. Women do not preside over men, while men preside over women. The Family Proclamation declares that men preside over their wives and families and spells out other gender roles.  I learned that the first time a women led a prayer in a general conference session was not until 2013.   My beliefs and conclusion  I believe that all people should have equal opportunity regardless of gender, and I do not believe that gender hierarchy comes from God.   Final Conclusion  These major issues make it so that I can longer in good conscience remain a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I once thought that the church had the fullness of the gospel, but now I see that it is just another human organization, founded by a man with a track record of dishonesty and continued by men with a history of not being able to interpret God’s will. I will miss all of the good people in the church with whom I’ve made friends, but now that I know what I know about church doctrine and practice, I have chosen not to remain a member.

exmormon,3duv2x,happy_jimmy,23,Sun Jul 19 18:43:14 2015 UTC,"The ""ward"" is the group. ""Wards"" are generally geographic boundaries that encompass a group of people who all attend church at a set building and time.  A ""priesthood holder"" is someone who is male and reaches age 12. Basically we all pretend he receives God's magic power. Then every couple years they get like a slight upgrade to their priesthood until they reach 18 when they get the FULL priesthood. Then they can like... well... actually it's all made up so they can't do anything with it, but the idea is that they can do God stuff when they figure it out (eg. in the afterlife and sometimes when people are really sick or scared.)  Obedience is a pretty big deal in Mormon church, and all religion really. You have the leaders who are seen by the masses as being something unique and special. They aren't, but as long as they can have people being obedient to them it gives them power. They want to keep the power so obviously preaching obedience is tantamount to the success of the church.  The communion cups are exactly what you say - for symbolizing drinking Christ's blood. Mormons used to use wine, but then one of the leaders decided all alcohol was a sin and they started using water. This was around prohibition time and Mormons never changed back from that.  Yep, all churches have that wall. Some branches (small wards for places like.. rural Kentucky or.. wherever there aren't many Mormons) may not, but all official church owned buildings that ""wards"" attend will have that wall. I've actually never thought anything of it. Do other churches do this differently?  Even if you're raised Mormon, doing that for 3 hours a week is painful. It leads to you questioning and discovering too much and then... well... that's why there are 22,418 subscribers to a recovering religious forum.  My advice: Thank your friend for inviting you. Never go back."
exmormon,3duv2x,Stratiform,13,Sun Jul 19 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"A ""priesthood holder"" is someone who is male and reaches age 12. Basically we all pretend he receives God's magic power. Then every couple years they get like a slight upgrade to their priesthood until they reach 18 when they get the FULL priesthood. Then they can like... well... actually it's all made up so they can't do anything with it, but the idea is that they can do God stuff when they figure it out (eg. in the afterlife.)   Holy shit I haven't laughed that hard for a while. Thank you sir!"

exmormon,3duv2x,QuiescentAdolescent,3,Sun Jul 19 22:19:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a little spotty on my history, but if I recall correctly a lot of protestant religions are explicitly against obedience to higher authority. The pastor or minister is available to advise the congregation but the people themselves are responsible for their own spirituality.  I think we got the term Protestant because they protested against the Catholic church's system of having to go through priests and saints and popes to talk to God.  The whole idea was a direct spiritual relationship between a person and God, and that I recall being told that  was also a reason bibles started being printed en masse as opposed to just being easily available to clergy."

exmormon,3duv2x,zaffiromite,5,Sun Jul 19 19:54:18 2015 UTC,"Once a month, the ward holds a fast-and-testimony meeting where anyone in the audience is invited to come up to the pulpit and bear there testimony, including toddlers.  If there hadn't been a wall there when I went to bear my testimony, I don't think I would have bothered with the stairs.  I would have just jumped straight off the stage.  Also, now that I think of it, the wall could probably be used for puppet shows.  (Thinking about it even more, that's pretty much what it's being used for now.)"

exmormon,3duv2x,SideburnHeretic,4,Sun Jul 19 19:21:46 2015 UTC,"It was a pretty typical sunday sounds like. A ward is the local congregation and is divided into a geographic area around the building.  If you live in that area you go to that building. The stake is a bigger area that is basically a group of wards. The stake leaders visit different wards to speak or oversee meetings.  Stake comes from the bible as in stake of zion - the stakes hold up the tent of christs church. Always water, yes and it does symbolize the blood."

exmormon,3duv2x,Pulz4r,5,Sun Jul 19 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"Yup. That's how it goes. Every Sacrament meeting in every ward (which basically means ""congregation"", btw, and it is based on local geography) has the same agenda. The two hours you skipped are a bit different - smaller Sunday school classes, with the last hour separated by gender.  You were right on point with the fake emotion during the speaker's talk. Mormons equate being emotional with ""feeling the Spirit"", so it often comes across as forced.  To answer your questions, yes, it's always water in those tiny cups. The mormon scriptures say to use wine, but because some other mormon scripture says wine is forbidden they use water.  Also, yes, there's usually a wall between the stage and the pews. It's actually kind of creepy how almost all mormon churches look the same - even down to the paint schemes and ""art"" on the walls. Did the building you attended have the weird scratchy plastic carpet stuff on the walls?"

exmormon,3dwvhw,Totheriptide,3,Mon Jul 20 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"Personally I would just suggest little things, as those make the biggest difference. Remind her that she is a human being and natural thoughts dont make her bad. Casually introduce the idea that the ""spirit"" is only her own mind. Remind her that we are told to seek after knowledge, and so she should do that. Idk, just small things that get her thinking without feeling like you're trying to change her."

She won't be able to escape truth forever, especially with the inevitable shake-up the church will experience in the next few years. More and more people will leave, more and more will be public about it when they do, and those who stay will have a hard time keeping quiet.

exmormon,3dwvhw,AmoraTambora,5,Mon Jul 20 05:51:56 2015 UTC,"I've encountered that logic a lot. It really boils down to semantics. Faith is such a improperly defined word. The problem with mormons is they have such a weird pseudo poetic thing going on. Like saying the church is ""true"" I've found this to be meant more like an archaic use as in ""the sword struck true"" meaning it did what it was supposed to do, it delivered, like they claim the gospel will. When mormons say the church is true, what they never mean is that it actually holds up to scrutiny. Or they may make that claim, but quickly regret it and opt for the burning bosom route to test the truth of it.  The idea that the truest things require the least evidence or actually in this case its definitionally insufficient evidence, is so crazy it really is a master stroke of mental gymnastics. One of the best lessons for me was this video where richard dawkins illustrates what science would sound like if it managed its truth claims the way religions do."

exmormon,3dwvhw,rocinante1322,3,Mon Jul 20 05:54:14 2015 UTC,"That's a common defense, your sister would have picked it up from someone regardless of whether you said it or not.  When people say things like this, that the evidence is 50-50 to test if we'll make the right choice, they never explain why belief in God (or the LDS Church or whatever) is the moral choice.  It is just assumed.  Is it really fair for God to judge us on a choice that could go either way according to the evidence?  That seems profoundly unfair.  Also, it's not even close to 50-50, it's like 99.9999 to 0.0001."
exmormon,3dwvhw,Unmormon1,2,Mon Jul 20 14:18:26 2015 UTC,"Just kind of casually backtrack, bringing up hints that it would be false. For example, faith cant exist without something real to base it off of.Also,  God supposedly revealed himself to JS and was very involved in bible times, why did that change? Why would he just stop being a part of the living world today, if he is really the same yesterday, today, and forever?  Little things that chip at the idea are good."

exmormon,3dwo7j,bkpisdead,10,Mon Jul 20 03:53:32 2015 UTC,"One thing that I think is that we are taught constantly that our purpose is to be a mom and a good wife. We have to marry in the temple to a worthy priesthood holder, bear children into the covenant, etc. We're made to think that without those things, we're worthless. When you grow up being taught and believing that, it's hard to turn around and say you don't need it to be happy. So, women stay in TSCC, even with their doubts, because they don't really have a purpose outside of it.  Just a thought."
exmormon,3dwo7j,Totheriptide,9,Mon Jul 20 04:10:31 2015 UTC,"I think that TSCC also becomes the extent of their life. Women are pressured to marry an RM while they're still very young, and to become mothers and good housewives. Working outside the home is discouraged, as nothing takes prevalence over rearing Mormon babies. So they end up with:  1) Little to no education. They often marry right out of high school or the beginning of college and are discouraged from finishing any secondary education. Men are highly encouraged to finish their degree.  2) An LDS family. They have a BIC RM husband and good little Mormon babies and a whole Mormon family.   3) Mormon friends. Since they are usually at home or running around taking their kids to school or sports, they seldom have time for socialization outside of anything other than church, whereas men have careers. And in their careers they have a more diverse network of friends in addition to their friends at church.  So the world revolves around TSCC for many Mormon women: that's where they have their friends, their family, and their livelihood."
exmormon,3dwo7j,Ua_Tsaug,5,Mon Jul 20 04:24:12 2015 UTC,"Just a side note on the bit about education- I remember it being talked about previously by GAs that we should all go to college and pursue education. And then they still say we, as women, shouldn't have careers. So, what im seeing is, go get deep in debt, then focus on popping out more babies and never having a job."
exmormon,3dwo7j,Totheriptide,4,Mon Jul 20 04:39:24 2015 UTC,"And assuming they're a stay at home mom, not much is going to change if they do leave the church.  They can't easily finish or start school and go begin a career with a flock of little ones at home."
exmormon,3dwo7j,Unmormon1,8,Mon Jul 20 12:04:16 2015 UTC,"They encourage women to get married young and pop out a bunch of kids. As an exmo and mom of 2 kiddos very close together, I can tell you that you don't get much time to socialize or gain friendships. It's much easier to do in the church setting. Not having the community and weekly socialization with other adults (besides my husband) was very hard and very lonely. Only one lady stayed in contact with me at all after I left. I think community and social activities are a big reason women stay.   Another reason why I think they stay longer is because they are promised a forever family. After 9 months of pregnancy, pushing out a baby and then rearing that child, you get attached. I would love for there to be something after this life so that I knew death wasn't final and would only keep me from my family for a short while until we were all together again. Dealing with the fact that this may not be the case is still terrifying and depressing for me."
exmormon,3dwo7j,chamcd,2,Mon Jul 20 04:15:54 2015 UTC,"Not having the community and weekly socialization with other adults   I always thought this was the basis for women, or anyone, to stay.

exmormon,3dwo7j,codemoney,6,Mon Jul 20 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"I think the church encourages men to be 'scriptorians' and study the texts (especially during missions) whereas women are encouraged to rely on their feelings more. I think men are far more likely to come across damning information because of this divide.   Even though I'm a lady and left, this has caused problems in my own marriage. My husband went on a mission and perceives that he knows a lot about the 'gospel' and I'm just full of anti-Mormon lies because I've never been as familiar with the scriptures as him. And yet he's never heard of the kinderhook plates and does the adult equivalent of sticking his fingers in his ears and going ' lalala' when I tried to bring it up."

That's the church for men. ""Oh, you successfully fulfilled your role as a deacon? Level up!"" Teacher, priest, mission, wife, kid, multiple kids, full time breadwinner, church calling, EQ presidency, Bishopric, stake presidency - it never ends until you're dead. No one wants to finish a never ending game. Some people do last their whole lives. But if they had lived long enough it would probably wear them down too.  Now think of one of those insidious games with the Skinnerian bullshit like Animal Crossing or FarmVille. That's the church for women. It's simple. Straightforward. By the time I was 28 I had fulfilled my eternal role as a wife and mother. Like... That's it for me. Not that difficult a task. But, like Skinnerian games, if you stop cultivating those few tasks assigned, the game turns on you and you'll start losing shit.   You have one group (men) going ""wow, I'll never make it to the end screen"" and another group (women) who made it to the end screen ages ago, and now the church just makes it in our best interest to cultivate and keep what little we have control over. It is hard to give up after you've already ""won.""  The goals for women, while BS, are at least attainable."

exmormon,3dwo7j,Acesoami,5,Tue Jul 21 00:33:04 2015 UTC,The same reason women stay in abusive relationships. Self worth is destroyed to make them emotionally dependent to their abuser.
exmormon,3dwo7j,Louchlyn,4,Mon Jul 20 06:21:45 2015 UTC,"I've been asking myself this question.  How could I possibly have stayed so long?  It's a very painful answer.  I was not strong enough to trust myself.  I was taught and I believed that my worth depended on trusting the authority and wisdom of men - old men, sexist men, thoughtless men.  I had to believe them, though, or I was unworthy of love.  Not God's love, not parental love, not romantic love, not any kind of real love could ever reach me if I did not believe.  This is what I thought.  To me, this is the underlying danger in the cult.  A rational, independent, thinking person would be strong enough to see it is false and dangerous, and walk away.  But the cult makes you irrational, unreasonable and utterly dependent.  To overcome the cult's power sooner would have felt to me like defying my ancestors, calling my living family members fools, and proclaiming myself smarter than the kindest, wisest God-like people on earth.  It was not possible.  A second reason I stayed is related to the way I was taught to interpret ""spiritual"" experiences.  I believe the feelings of the ""spirit"" or ""testimony"" I felt were only feelings evoked out of a hope or expectation of being loved.  I associated those feelings with spiritual truth.  (I was hugged after my baptism, I was praised after bearing my testimony, I was valued as a missionary, I was trusted as a primary president.... My worth was established by my testimony and my devotion.)  Once I interpreted my emotions as ""spiritual truth"" they had me hooked.   I accepted that these warm fuzzy feelings meant what they said (God spoke to me, and the church is true). I felt I could not betray the sacred knowledge God had given me.    What a sick, sick system.  What a brilliant way to mess people up.  What an awful way to pass on hell to the next generation."

exmormon,3dwo7j,iBear83,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:12:56 2015 UTC,"I wonder if men are treated a little harsher than the women when they are coming of age? Young men are STRONGLY encouraged to go on missions and then they are expected to become the HEADS of households and take on the full burden of financially supporting a large family as the sole breadwinner.  Speaking only for myself, I can say that these things scared the daylights out of me when I was a teenager. So much so that I left the country (and my community) to escape the social pressure of going on a mission.  I am not saying that things are easier for the women, but I don't think they are put through the same ""tests"" that the young men are. All they have to do is get married and do everything the men say. While this may be sexist and soul sucking, it doesn't require you actively do a lot.  I can't help but compare what happens to young people in the LDS church and to what Lindsay Hansen Park describes occurs amongst the Mormon fundamentalists in her Polygamy podcasts. The fundamentalists make life very tough for young men and pretty much drive out any young men who won't tow the line. By contrast, women aren't given the option of leaving, although obedience is still expected.  I get the impression that young women find it harder to completely foresake their families than young men as a condition of escaping their religion. None of the young LDS women I grew up with fled the community to live by themselves when they graduated high school, but I know of at least 2 other boys my age who did the same thing I did.

It won't be easy,  but maybe try to tough it out for the 3 hours a week until you graduate.  In the meantime, work on the following:   Keep working and making your own money and get your bank balance as high as you can.  Any chance you could work on Sunday?    Look into college scholarships and formulate a plan with your school counselors on getting through college without your parents' help. Look around and find prospective roommates and prospective full time job opportunities. See if there is any way you can graduate early or start taking college classes while still in high school.  You will be that much ahead when you graduate. Get a survival bag ready with a couple changes of clothes, money, a warm jacket, and some nonperishable food in case you get kicked out.

Unfortunately my family was going through a crisis (my dad was leaving the church, my parent fought abusively) and I couldn't risk losing my place while my sister was at home  (we were the last two to leave home). Once she went to college I went off (I'd already been attending, but near home) as well and simply allowed time and distance to get the Mormons out of my life.

So you face two problems:  1) Your parents are not interfering in your finances (so the first thing the judge is going to ask is ""Why the hell are you wasting our time?"" albeit with somewhat more tact); and  2) You lack financial independence (so the judge's next question is ""What's your plan, hotshot?"").

At considerable cost to my own mental health, I've been able to manage that.  I'm sorry I cannot do the addition meetings that you are now requesting.  I hope you will honor our agreement.""  Truth is that they cannot force you to go to church, and if you are a minor, they have to support you financially and with a home either with them or someone else.  If the issue is that they are having trouble with your siblings wanting to also not have to go, then tell your siblings that you need them to cut it out and quit fighting about it, so parents won't be so scared of you.  Remind them that they can do their own negotiating when they are 17, just like you are doing."

Also if you are still in high school even if you turned 18, they still can't kick you out legally.  If you talk to the right legal counsel about this, that could put your parents in hot water.  Another thing you could do is tell your Bishop about your parents conditional love and ask if he supports this.  Maybe your Bishop can straitened your parents out.  Maybe you could start talking about what you believe in at church anyway and explain your parents' conditional love.  There are ways to make your parents look like a bunch of assholes if you play your cards right.  If you really want to be bold if you are underage, force their hand.  See if they would kick you out for not going to church.  Maybe it's a bluff to emotionally control you.  If they follow through, make sure you know your way to a police station and report the crime.  Next, make sure the press finds out by going to a local TV station or newspaper office.  Put them in deep shit.  And lastly, make sure you don't tell them you're going to do this.

Prolly good idea to save recording to the cloud.   Really, as a minor your rights have been and are heavily restricted so of course you dont have enough cash to live on your own.

The judge really liked that. :)  I had also already graduated early from high school, with several AP classes and a good gpa.  You will need enough money in savings to pay deposit and first month's rent. Plus be able to show that your job pays enough for you to pay rent, buy groceries, get transportation, pay utilities, etc. I had a monthly budget all set up and provided that to the judge.

You know your parents and your situation way better than I do!  [First try] ""Parents, going to church is very difficult and stressful for me.  We compromised before and I want to maintain that compromise.  Please don't try to force me to go to church.""

Please respect my choice to attend only sacrament meetings.""  [Not a threat... Just telling it like it is, in more ways than one.] ""Parents, our deal was that I would go to sacrament meeting and not tell anyone about my disbelief.  I would like to keep that deal.  But if you make me go to all three hours of church, I will not be able to just not say anything about believing, which means I will have to tell the truth.  I know you believe in honesty and would not try to make me give up my integrity, so you'll have to choose between my 3 hour attendance and my silence.""  [If they won't budge] ""Parents, I love you but I do not feel the same way you do about the church.  I want our family to get through this difficult time and stay close despite our differences.  Please help me make that happen by respecting my feelings and agency.""  [So they cry themselves to sleep?  Well, you feel unloved by them.  Two can play that game.] ""Parents, I am so sorry that this is hard for you.  But making me go to church will not change how I feel about the church.  It only changes how I feel about you.  I want to see you as my allies, but you are pushing me to do things that go against what I believe.  I love you, and I think you love me, but when you force me to go to church and pretend to believe something I don't, it doesn't feel like you love me at all.""    Good luck!"

At this point, you don't really know the price you'll pay for defying your parents but you do know that they'll pay for room and board in exchange for you going along with their wishes. I think many people would like to be in your shoes. You can use that time in church to daydream and make a plan. No doubt many people wish they had such a luxury.   At 17, it's normal for most kids to feel like living at home is the worst thing ever-- it's what drives you to get it together and move up and out.  Who would leave the nest if living at home was great?  Keep a journal of these feelings-- because even though you will, of course, be way cooler than your parents... one day your own kid will feel the same sort of eagerness to leave-- ah, the circle of life. Write down your goals, and use your time in church to plan steps towards those goals. Congratz on having a decent job. Now you can begin thinking about what you will be doing when you turn 18."

I know she worries I will ""regress"" or find something else to be ""addicted to"" or obsess over.   Ex-Mormons rarely go back.  Most of us got out because we could be honest enough with ourselves to realize it's all bullshit.  Going back is out of the question because we're pissed off at being lied to all our lives and now we can see through the lies and all the bullshit.  Sorry, she doesn't seem like the one for you.

Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence."""

The original converts were for the most part in a desperate situation during the industrial revolution. Desperation and hunger in combination with a lack of education is more than enough to make anyone much more suggestible and vulnerable to ""too good to be true"" claims.  This is all situational and has nothing to do with genetics. Although many of these people were probably malnourished from birth which would possibly have some impact on their reasoning abilities, but that is not genetics.   I think relatively there weren't many people leaving up until 20 years ago, because so little information was easily available and many Mormon communities were still somewhat isolated from the rest of the country at least culturally.  Beliefs are mostly a phenomenon of conformance. Although I would like to credit my amazing reasoning abilities to leaving Mormonism, the truth is that a large part of it was me conforming to the views I was learning about through the internet and college as I became aware that they were the majority view. Taking a logic class also helped.  Having a close friend who revealed he left Mormonism was also a very major influence. Conformance has the strongest influence from our closest relationships. More people than ever today have close friends who are leaving, so this leaves more room for conformance to have an effect.  Although I absolutely do think Mormon culture evolved to encourage gullible traits to be nurtured out of universal human needs for comfort, certainty, and belonging. So I think it's more accurate to say that we were taught to be gullible rather than bred."

Ricks, was a prominent polygamist, I did not know he was an alleged murderer. While sheriff of cache county, he shot and killed a man supposedly trying to escape the make shift jail. Several years later, while serving on a grand jury he was actually himself indicted for the alleged crime. There are conspiracy theories as to why witnesses (who originally said the ""inmate"" wasn't actually fleeing when shot), ultimately wouldn't testify against Ricks. The theories include that the pressure and power of The Mormons in the community and judicial system was too great For the witnesses to risk their own safety. It was a lot to wrap my head around. This man I grew up being taught to revere, was not what I had been told. Much like the Mormon church itself."

In this case, they call the church apostate. By their own Mormon definitions, the church doesn't have a priesthood to give them.  Or, if they don't believe in the One-Trueness of the church, or in face-to-face revelation to prophets, then they disregard the truth claims of the church, and it still doesn't have a priesthood to give them.

Tea contains tannins other than tannic acid. Tannins are bad for you. - False. As explained below, tannins have both positive and negative effects on health, and like most substances, are healthiest in moderation. Tannins taste bad or make a tea low quality - False. Too high a concentration of tannins in a cup of tea can result in an unpleasantly astringent cup, but tannins also impart a sensation of body and strength to a tea, and make for a richer mouthfeel: a black tea with too few tannins would be more likely to seem watery, weak, or bland."

The LDS church membership will give a big sigh of relief when they finally treat gay people as equals, just as they did when they dropped the black restrictions.  In the future members will want to get rid of the stigma of being a Mormon Bigot and will welcome the new revelation from the lord that does that."
exmormon,3dvptj,astralboy15,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:06:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know about sigh of relief. 99% of the TBMs I know are definitely not LGBT friendly, they loathe it just as much as BKP does. I know a lot of people talk on her about how so many members are inwardly (and outwardly) LGBT friendly but I just don't see that in the TBM circles I am around.  Frankly, if the church would all of a sudden 180 on the idea it would make outing myself really easy. Regardless of my personal feelings regarding the LGBT thing it would be so easy to just say - ""look, the just reversed something they said was eternal and unchanging, I'm out y'all"" and hopefully bring people with me..."
exmormon,3dvptj,PayLeyAle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:15:10 2015 UTC,Yes and in a few decades many of the TBM will be old or dying and the younger generations who grew up with gay friends and families will be greater number in the church and they will lead to the change.  This has all happened before with the blacks and with polygamy. There is no reason to think it will end differently with the gays.  Mormonism is the church of ever changing doctrine

They used the same dirty play book to fight gay marriage, state by state, and for a while they were winning.  I don't think they anticipated the Supreme Court decision until the Kitchen case introduced gay marriage in Utah 18 months ago.  They only really started facing the loss 3-4 months ago.  They are still coping with the idea that this is like interracial marriage/minority rights rather than the women's rights movement.."
exmormon,3dvptj,ShemL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:40:48 2015 UTC,Good point.  I have forgotten about Mormon's and their anti-ERA movement.

exmormon,3dufbt,DuoCitizen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:02:28 2015 UTC,I'm in pretty much the same situation.  My wife told me she's not going to leave me for having doubts which I'm extremely grateful for.  She has a leadership calling in the ward and I continue to go so that it is less of a burden on her.  I'm willing to make that sacrifice.  She has concerns of her own but her shelf is still intact for now.  My kids are still young and I feel the best thing I can do is try to counter the church's idolatry with simpler forms of worship.

Everyone should make their own mind up about what they believe.  It's a good idea to learn about religion.  When you are (12? Now?) ready you can choose if you want to go.    I'd get into a little more detail individually with the older ones, maybe waiting till they ask or having a conversation where they can think through their beliefs.  Even at that age they are very bright and thinking about those things, talking with friends about it....

As what may or may not be a helpful side note - I left byui without technically graduating - requirements were completed, I wasn't going to walk, and I had already been accepted in to my professional program and most programs in medicine don't actually require you to have a degree, just that the pre-reqs are done, so I simply never got around to applying for graduation. Fast forward 12 months and I felt it would probably be wise to go ahead and get that piece of paper I had previously earned, and, believe if or not I had to go and get an endorsement (as a non byu student) from my bishop in order to apply for graduation.

Bunch of kids with behavioral problems, psychological disorders, and criminal histories, all lumped together under the authority of a ""psychiatrist"" who was more interested in breaking our wills and making us conform, than in actually doing anything to help those of us who had real problems.  Helpful? Not even slightly, except in some of my outward behavior. I went in a frightened kid who constantly skipped school because of academic difficulties and severe social anxiety, and came back an angry teen who hated the world and was suspicious of the motives of everyone around him, on top of the problems I already had.  Traumatic? Absolutely. They tried to break me of my 'defiant' behaviour by accusing me of infractions I did not commit, punished me with harsh physical labor and deprivation of all basic dignity, and then used brainwash-y, cultish techniques to make me question my own memories. It was, if you'll excuse the language, some damn fucked up shit.  As for Mormonism, the entire program was run by mormons, and every inmate was required to attend and participate in weekly church services. Any questioning of doctrine, disrespect of church figures, or even reluctance to participate enthusiastically in church activities, was punished with the same severity as instigating a physical altercation with a fellow inmate. It quickly soured me on some of the more social aspects of the religion, to the chagrin of the program directors.  I'm okay now, but it took me a very long time to deal with that period of my life, mostly by repressing the worse parts of it until I was distanced enough emotionally from the memories to look back on it with a cool head.

exmormon,3du2go,zoom54321,3,Sun Jul 19 19:18:34 2015 UTC,"I see where he's coming from because I had the same perspective.  No was VERY forgiving of the actions of past prophets because I never really believed they were perfect men who rrceives unmistakable revelation on even a fraction of what they taught.   This is why it took me so long to leave after learning about all the shady aspects of church history.   From an argument standpoint, I would not base an argument on an angle that could be dismissed by accepting the fallibility of prophets.  I would Maybe base it on acknowledging that the true history of the church, when seen as a whole, has all the signs of a con.  It likely he knows about the dirty secrets of Mormon history (ie: polygamy) but doesn't know the damning details of it (ie: lied to Emma, practiced in secret, involved underage girls, involved other married women, involved sex, etc.)  From the standpoint of a friend, I would give your reasoning and be open for discussion, I wouldn't Push to convert though."
exmormon,3du2go,sushi_hamburger,3,Sun Jul 19 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"and it's easy to mix up feelings of the spirit and feelings of what yourself desires.    Exactly. He's mixing up what he wants to believe with some kind of revelation. He has probably never really thought about being out of the con. He's never really realized that it's better on the outside.   He talks about how people are missing out on the benefits of a job but doesnt realize that they may now have a great job where benefits aren't quite as good but going to work everyday is so much better.   Frankly, he sounds like someone that just puts his head down and grinds through life without really thinking about alternate possibilities."
exmormon,3du2go,articulett,2,Sun Jul 19 17:12:11 2015 UTC,He wants to believe because he feels like it would wreck his life if he doesn't-- you'd prefer to believe things that are true...   I think parachutewoman has the right response. He's made it very clear that he's not interested in whether what he believes is true or not.

For me, I chose it because I believed it to be literally, empirically true. For you, it's about the feelings of assurance you get from participating. When I discovered that the church was empirically false, my integrity could only permit departure. For you, the feelings you get from participation remain irrespective of the facts. You're welcome to it, and I hope you find peace however you can. But for so many, their church experience is not one off assurance like yours.

It's cause of the underlying traditional/cultural US/British (old puritanical) view that nudity = sex, along with the continual body image fetish driven by the media.  The more ""modesty"" is held up as an ideal, the more taboo nudity becomes, and the more we obsess and sexualize nudity. The cycle is self sustaining.  Other cultures don't have anywhere near the same emphasis or obsession over nudity and modesty, and hence don't sexualize it anywhere near as much, they also tend to be more comfortable with and accepting of normal body types."

What if I told you it's possible to be sexually attracted to someone and care about them as a person? It's almost as if the entire institution of marriage depends on that being a thing.

Is this an actual phenomenon, or just a quirk of the selection presented?"
exmormon,3du406,YoungModern,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:14:01 2015 UTC,"Newnamenoah has shown his face in some of his videos, and Flackerman's face is his profile pic, and so is Brother Jake's. Brother Jake actually shows up in person in his first video on his channel, as well as a few more, but it interrupts the flow of his videos, so the new ones don't have it. He certainly isn't shy. As for the others, I don't see how their face is relevant to what they do. So I don't think even the selection I did pick for you actually even represents that assumption, and I don't think it really applies to people making PowerPoint style presentations.   There are actually several others that I came across of exMo YouTubers just speaking commentary while looking into their laptop camera, but they were either annoying, very personal, too broadly beyond the scope of exMos, or low on quality content.  For example, Laci Green has mentioned being an exMo a few times, but the vast majority of what she does is not exMo-specific content.  Shawn McCraney is obviously very visible as a pastor.   Many others make more specifically atheist content than exMo content, or are kinda dumping their emotions about personal stuff. I didn't feel the need to include them.  So I'm going to say no on both accounts -it's not a phenomenon worth mentioning, and it's not even representative of the selection presented."

exmormon,3dsaar,happilyheathen_67,6,Sun Jul 19 17:25:02 2015 UTC,"One story I heard was that the WoW was written because the women were complaining about the heavy smoke in the men's meetings.  The men then added coffee and tea to make the women suffer as well.  I always suspected the WoW was just jumping on the temperance bandwagon and reciting the heath theories of the day.  Among other things, there was a theory that hot drinks cooked your body.  There was probably also a strong dose of puritan ethic; if it tasted good or was fun it must be bad."
exmormon,3dsaar,dudleydidwrong,3,Sun Jul 19 02:17:56 2015 UTC,"The context was also important, many Puritans were fine with good food, or certain dishes apart from each other, but not say, Mince-Meat pie, which is spicy, and savory, or other Christmas dishes and deserts traditionally associated with Catholic culture. Some even liked such dishes, but never in December. But yeah, moderation was also kind of a thing, too. Some music was fine, probably, but they didn't like theaters because they were dens of iniquity (sort of true, the cheap section was wall to wall pick pocketing and prostitution and rowdiness), and Merry Mount settlement got burned to the ground because they both openly flaunted their gambling and prostitution industry, and popular festivals like May Pole dancing, which IS a pagan hold over. Oh, and they competed excessively with the local Pilgrim settlement over fur trapping, I think. Not that the black jack and hookers and may pole dancing didn't make people mad. It's just that the people with the real power were especially annoyed by their bottom line being cut into, so that got them on board.  They probably did lean on public drunkenness ordinances more than was usual, I'm sure too. Otherwise they were very much ""sensible chuckle"" and ""parable of the Ant and Grasshopper"" type people. And the culture thing. They were very concerned about preserving their non worldly/""Popish"" culture. It kind of reminds you of the sensibility that fed into Mormonism about being apart, and that of other serious, sort of clannish religious groups, like some of the more serious Hebrew and Islamic sects. They get somewhere, and it's all about being distinct, and being kind of low key, if not totally serious, all the time. And really really pious."

exmormon,3dsyrc,ATmega32,2,Sun Jul 19 05:18:25 2015 UTC,"Dang. I love hearing that couples go out together, but it makes me so envious. Before I first came out to her, I got the ""do it slow"" advice and I intended on taking it. But, stupid me opened the flood gates one day. Actually, I brought up small points of concern little by little about a year before that and was dismissed. She dismissed the importance of the information (adam/god, polygamy, etc) and expressed the desire to not be presented with any more because of the criticizing nature of it. So, I let it fester for the next year while gathering most of this information. Then one day during general conference I couldn't take it anymore. Yeah, it fucked things up pretty bad. I should have done it different in hindsight. But, I think this is the only option I have left. I mean, the information is indisputable right?"
exmormon,3dsyrc,ATmega32,2,Sun Jul 19 05:42:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  I think a reasonable person could probably look at the same set of facts I looked at and come to a different conclusion.  I get your frustration, though.  I thought my wife and I had come to an agreement where we weren't going to pressure the children either way and she went back on that agreement a few times.  I mostly bit my tongue but once I got mad and things were tense for a long time after that.  It turned out I didn't need to worry.  My kids are pretty smart and figured things out pretty much on their own and now both are out.  Even though she still believes, my wife has mellowed a great deal.  The weird thing is I've gotten to the point where I actually want her to stay.  I've come to realize that being active LDS is her authentic identity.  It's who she is naturally and makes her happy.  Ultimately, I don't want to stand in the way of her happiness."
exmormon,3dsyrc,ATmega32,3,Sun Jul 19 09:49:55 2015 UTC,"The hardest part about this process is that it happens in everyone's own time.  I don't know that you can force realizations, regardless of how well presented or complete the evidence.  From my experience and observations the problem is rooted not in the evidence but in the lack of acceptance of an alternative lifestyle.  I suspect that most TBM's have doubts and even know deep down inside their religion is flawed.  Validating evidence will only cause frustration.  Accepting that the church is not true puts a TBM in a difficult situation, how to live their life going forward.  Since alternative lifestyles are by and large condemned by TSCC, a TBM has nowhere to turn and thus is unable to process the truth.  My opinion is to validate a lifestyle outside of the church, one that remains secure and full of love and support.  If a TBM can see acceptable alternatives, they will be more willing to face the hard truths (that they may already know)."

exmormon,3dsyrc,triinkle,2,Sun Jul 19 07:22:14 2015 UTC,"I think the change began when we became a part-member family.  I stopped attending and she took the kids (4 of them) by herself every Sunday.  She was stigmatized and isolated by the culture and a perpetual calling in primary/nursery burned her out.  After many years in this position, she was ready for a change.  We moved in 2010 at which point she decided to take a break and hasn't gone back but maybe a few times.  In the meanwhile I would interject small tidbits of church history and doctrinal problems.  I think it all accumulated.  Our son showed her this sub about two months ago.  The shelf that was already barely hanging on by this point finally came down.  All this and polygamy.  For her, polygamy was always an issue, even as a kid.  Then the church published the essay on the topic like a nail in a coffin.  I'm summarizing a lot of events here in recounting the steps.  Maybe one of these days she'll OP her story.  DW says: be careful about giving yours too much information at once. Instead, listen to her and listen to what she struggles with, something will bother her and then slowly build on those concerns.  And polygamy.  DW has never met a woman who is okay with it."

The night we reached a point where he understood what I was doing and was ""ok"" with it, was when I made a sincere emotional appeal (broke down sobbing) on ONE issue. He stopped worrying about defending the church and was anxious to defend me.  Similarly, what led to his disaffection was ONE issue that I would never have guessed and didn't affect me for a while--that was that God was giving us different answers even though we were both sincere truth seeking individuals. To him that was the ultimate betrayal given how the Book of Mormon wraps up.  My point is: keep on writing this because someday she'll care to read it and and it will help you get the frustration out, but maybe try to find a smaller number of things that deeply affect you and focus on those from a more vulnerable place so that she feels a desire to defend you and not the church."

Yeah sometimes you guys suck at communicating...  A few tips to help your wife:  You're right ""the tired"" line is usually something else combined with truly being tired out. Given the ages and size of your family she likely is tired often. MANY TIMES the gift of time can do wonders.  Two or three hours just for her away from the home. Do this regularly! Grocery shopping and errands do not count :)   Giving her that freedom can put  you in a very good light, especially if she returns home and you have cleaned up for everyone. ( she doesn't come home to a bomb explosion)   I am currently a fairly fresh exmo to a TBM . I know he is hurt that I don't want to attend or be a part  of the church after all these years.  ( temple married 20yrs)  He feels very insecure so I find that consistent small gestures reassure him. And to be honest it has refreshed our marriage.   I like that you are planning new activities with your family. Consistently doing these will ease transitions and show your wife that no one is missing out.  I've noticed people talk about the structure of the church and its importance. As if we cannot create our own activities equally beautiful and motivational/inspiring ?   Find a therapist. Regardless if she is ready it will benefit you tremendously. Odds are good she will see such a positive change in you, how you behave with the family,that she may wish to participate.  From the sound of your words you're a good man. Keep loving the woman you married and the beautiful children you created, I hope each day gets a little bit lighter."

exmormon,3dsc64,pdxerton,2,Sun Jul 19 18:27:08 2015 UTC,"I second the suggestion to let her get out! It sounds like she might be getting out a little for her music class,  but as a mom,  having time WITHOUT OBLIGATION is the best gift my husband can give me.  At least once a week,  take care of the kids solo,  and tell her to go get a manicure.   It is also the one thing my husband does that tells me how committed and capable he is with our kids. He likes to game too, but it's easy for me to run the house and let him decompress when he has returned the favor.  If I haven't had time lately,  it gets easy to be resentful.  And ""tired"".  My husband also bought me flowers this week.  It was the nicest thing.  Small suprises remind me that,  despite the kids and hectic life,  we were in love at one point, and even though love in marraige is different,  ""us"" (him and i) is still a real thing,  outside of ""us"" (him and i, +kids)."

I've come to terms that she may never leave, and that's ok. I love her still. I think that was important for her, to see that I still was devoted to her. I think this faith Crisis is a big shock for spouses. They have this perfect little life built, and then it comes tumbling down. They need to know it's not them, but the church. I'm devoted to her and that's what matters. Small steps!  I hope this helps."
exmormon,3dsc64,Darth_Jay,4,Sun Jul 19 00:14:46 2015 UTC,"Hi OP, I am in a similar situation just a little further down the road. There was a time about a year and a half ago when my wife and I were just roomates. I had been working 70 hour weeks for a good 5 years straight.   If I would have had my faith transition then it would been divorce in a heart beat so I am lucky that didn't happen. But what did happen is I left my job and started a business in the same field so I could have more free time.  Having that free time is what allowed me to come back to reality amd have enough time to research the church.  But more importantly it allowed me to reconnect with and redate my wife.  My biggest advice to you is date like crazy. Rekindle things. Grow new aspects of your relationship. Do stuff she likes to do. PAY THE MONEY FOR BABY SITTERS.  If you do that and the things you have mentioned in your plan you will make it.  Hang in there and just keep being a good person!"
exmormon,3dsc64,UltimateDracoMeteor,3,Sun Jul 19 05:49:07 2015 UTC,"What you have posted are all good thoughts.  One small suggestion.  I think it would be helpful for you to find a counselor to go talk to every couple of weeks (at least, more if you decide you need it).  Waking up to the fact that the church is false is very difficult.  There is more mental anguish in it than you are probably admitting to yourself.  A counselor will help process through some of that.  Its much better to process through your pain with a neutral 3rd party, who has mental health training than to blurt out some hurtful thing to your wife.  And as you start to make some positive changes in your life, and in your marriage, you can point to the therapy.  Going through individual therapy and making positive individual progress in your own life will help when you eventually suggest getting marital counseling with your wife.  I think you are on the right track.  So good luck.    One other thing.  It might be a good idea to talk to your health care provider about possibly going on some antidepressants to help with the depression.  I had a rough go of it when I had my faith crisis five years ago.  I eventually started taking 50 mg of zoloft about this time last year and I can honestly say that the difference is like night and day for me.  Its (metaphorically) saving my life right now.  I wish I would have gotten a counselor sooner for myself.  And I wish I would have gone on antidepressants sooner.  Anyway, I don't know if either one of these actually apply to you.  But I thought I'd bring it up as you have thought through so much other stuff and you're trying to make it work."
exmormon,3dsc64,knittywhitty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughts. I find many of your posts very valuable.  As for the depression, it's not as bad as it may sound.  What I mean is that I don't think anti-depressants are necessary for my case.  I can see how a counselor would really help.  I have kinda been holding off because I think the largest contributor to my negative thoughts stem from relationship problems, and it's going to be hard to resolve those without a neutral 3rd party, especially since she is still so attached to her parents.  After a few moments of thought, it now seems kinda silly to wait for all that for my own care.    I imagine you are right in that there is more mental anguish than I realized, and that I will have positive thoughts more often with the help of a counselor.  I have had a few days of very bright sunshine surrounded by partly cloudy days with the occasional overcast day, but I think I only had a hurricane the week after I came out to DW about my concerns."

exmormon,3dsc64,getyourhairwet,3,Sun Jul 19 12:27:52 2015 UTC,"Kindness and consideration go a long way.   I support my husband and daughter in their faith. I will help her with her clothes and hair, help with ties, and even craft supplies for their teaching assignments or whatever.  I will take my daughter to activity days, and have Mormon families over, and be kind to the members and elders when they come by for visits.  But I won't go to church and will not pretend belief. This caused a lot of strife for awhile, but for the past year or so I have been consistent and now they don't miss that I'm not there. Time heals if people stick around long enough to make that happen.   There have been several times I was tempted to leave my marriage, and my husband even packed his suitcase to go to his dad's once. I told him to unpack that bag, he is going nowhere. And you know what? He listened.   I won't let this church have my family. I will stand by my family no matter what personal suffering happens to me. It is working. My marriage is working out.  It is not perfect. We don't always get along, we fight, and sometimes emotionally try and disconnect. There can be resentments too. But I won't give up on him. And so far he won't give up on me either.   Just my story, of how it is possible to keep it together and improve your relationship. I know mine sounds kind of bad, but I still wouldn't trade him for the world."

You see, heaven is just an overall organization headed by...well...new management since the founding of the world. Anyway, rain is an event that must be authorized by three different bureaucracies: prayer, fasting and miracles.   The prayer department uses a prioritization policy: Prayer from a TBM comes before all other prayer. This is why TBMs report answered prayers on facebook and non TBMs starve in Africa. However, they still use ink quills and pens made out of a big feather and write in ledgers rather than paper so things get lost, forgotten or smudged. Once the prayer is processed and prioritized, the CRAP (committee recommendations and processing) begins.   CRAP sends this to the fasting committee since there is a fasting component, which is tasked to find who was fasting, when, for how long and why. Who is not only split by member/non-member but by degrees of TBMness. A PH will get a higher score by priesthood and position. If it is a group effort, the scores are averaged and then multiplied by a factor that takes into account the number of participants (and their score), date, duration and purpose. The why is very important...those in Africa who pray for food are technically fasting but they wouldn't be fasting if they had food so therefore it doesn't count. So if you go to F and T meeting and forgot to eat breakfast, that doesn't count either.  Anyway, the fasting committee will send their score to CRAP who will, in turn, send it to the miracle committee. The inner workings of this committee is mysterious but it is safe to say the morality or the need of the requests sent are not part of the consideration. This is why a TBM will find their car keys within minutes yet world peace is never going to happen.  Anyway, once they have made a determination of what, if anything, should be done the CRAP report is sent to the guy ought do (GOD) it. But this is a busy guy. He has his own bureaucracy that gives him the task list for that day. Now GOD does get stuff done, sometimes following the recommendations and sometimes with 'style', but again the recommendations passed on by feather quill pen book might be smudged or someone read the wrong recommendation or what have you.  Anyway, this is why fasting/prayer worked."

As a woman I saw so often men belittled, put down, and controlled by their wives (I think this goes both ways).  There's so much pressure for the men to be good priesthood leaders and patriarchs and they live under weighty expectations to perform and be ""real men"" in the gospel.  They are often made to push aside their own thoughts, beliefs, and feelings about the church because of the expectation to righteously lead their families in prayer, scripture study, ordinances, and priesthood blessings, to ideally hold a position of authority within the church to obtain full respect, and to lead the family to the celestial kingdom.  On top of that they are to be excellent bread winners in single income homes with baby after baby joining the family.

As I got older, I started to resent the way church leaders put women on a pedestal; it seemed more and more like they were trying to justify the obvious lack of equality by going on and on about how great and important women are. If they have to say it over and over again, do they really mean it and is it really true? With true equality, you don't have to rationalize or explain how a group is valued as much as another. With that said, I tried to live as though I was equal as much as I could, because I wanted to believe that I was. It wasn't until I went through the temple that I finally had it confirmed to me that I truly am second class in my religion. That was one of the worst days of my life.

The problem is, it didn't become apparent until I became an adult and my male overseers were no longer superiors in age/employment/insert status symbol here. The more American culture shifts in favor of feminism (which helps remedy unfair expectations of men too) the less sense the church crap makes to the youth. I saw it all the time.  My young women would ask stuff like ""Why don't we get banquets for earning personal progress? Why did the relief society used to be an autonomous organization but it isn't now? Why can't young women help pass the sacrament between rows like they do to their neighbors in the pew?"" and my answer was always the same- ""Because only men are allowed to make decisions about those things."" and some day i hope their dissatisfaction with that answer leads them to Kate Kelly it and challenge the status quo or gtfo. Or both."

Not every woman cares about authority in the abstract. Some women care more about the fact they are associated with a powerful man than they do about their own power relative to that man.  It's probably men and women that will leave the church in equal numbers.  For women to revolt against this power structure en masse they would have to perceive a socially acceptable alternative structure that provides security and where they can maintain an equivalent social position.  Otherwise, men and women will individually leave based on personal situation."

The church does not subjugate women. They are not second class citizens. Women are not discouraged from pursuing a career any more than men. Wives are not supposed to be subservient to their husbands. Lastly, just to be clear. Mormons do not persecute anyone in any way shape or form. Jesus Christ never tought nor condoned hatred or violence. If some rogue were to attack an abortion clinic that should not be interpreted as the will of the faith. Far too often the many are judged by the actions of a few. This post is more than slightly offensive. It is written to tarnish the Church of Jesus Christmas of Latter Day Saints as some form of oppressive and demeaning institution.

When I left I had numerous nevermo acquaintances and friends open up to me about their real perspective of the church (when I was in the church it was all positive seemingly).  I had a hard time understanding why seemingly benign church practices were so shocking to the outside world (like women not participating in their baby's blessing).  Sorry you find the post so offensive, but we don't filter our experiences and perceptions in order to spare Mormon's feelings.  It's just what we think of the church now.  And as far as what I'd personally like to portray, I would LOVE to make the things on this post visible to every Mormon (and nevermo if they didn't already know).

exmormon,3dsikh,zempter,12,Sun Jul 19 01:16:37 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation 3 years ago. Like others have said, hire a wedding planner if you can and ask your fiancé's mom for her input. r/weddings may have some good ideas for you as well. I would also add to keep your family in the loop so your parents have some idea of what you want and where they and their customs fit into things. My mom refused to hear about my non-Mormon wedding for a month because she thought it would make me see the error of my ways, get rebaptized, convert my fiancé, plan a bishop officiated wedding, and a temple wedding on our 1st anniversary. When I didn't change my mind she finally broke down in tears about how I wasn't getting the wedding I had always wanted as a little girl. I spent months trying convince her that people grow up and change their minds and an intimate ceremony with only very close friends/family and no big reception was exactly what I wanted. Eventually I had to tell her and my dad that they could either be grown ups about the whole situation and watch their oldest daughter get married in the way she and her fiancé wanted or they could stay home. She remained unconvinced that it could be a nice affair until after the ceremony when she admitted that it was the most beautiful wedding she had ever seen and that it was the personalized vows that made it that way.   Good luck and congratulations!"
exmormon,3dsikh,Kalisyn,7,Sun Jul 19 02:54:52 2015 UTC,"keep your family in the loop so your parents have some idea of what you want and where they and their customs fit into things   Uh, how would you fit any of this in there?   I had to tell her and my dad that they could either be grown ups about the whole situation and watch their oldest daughter get married in the way she and her fiancé wanted or they could stay home   Upvote x1000. I absolutely agree that taking a hard line is 100% necessary. I have to praise you like I should for showing spine.    plan a bishop officiated wedding   Bishops are frequently known to chastise the espoused for getting a time and not eternity wedding in front of everyone feuding the ceremony. In fact, it is the official church policy in the handbook to do so, and any bishop that does not is breaking the rules. I've never seen so much regret expressed over any type of wedding than I've seen over ones conducted by bishops. Please be mindful of that, /u/eattheburritos."
exmormon,3dsikh,YoungModern,8,Sun Jul 19 04:42:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry, my thought about how their traditions fit in didn't come across well. I didn't mean that the temple traditions or reception traditions need to be included at all, but that should be communicated up front so people have a little time to process through things before the wedding. My TBM dad honestly had thought I was going to buy a temple worthy wedding dress or alter what I bought to fit those modesty standards. He damn near had a coronary when he saw me in a sleeveless dress and I said I had no intention of altering or covering things. My brother wrongly assumed that since the small dinner we had planned after was at a nicer restaurant and not the church gym his kids weren't invited and got rather butt hurt over it for awhile. My mom had problems with us writing our own vows instead of just saying yes to what the officiant said. My uncle got pissed that we weren't having a big gym reception with free food for his 8 kids and said he wouldn't come for the ceremony; which was ok because it saved me having to tell his cheap ass he wasn't actually invited in the first place."

I support this.    My TBM dad honestly had thought I was going to buy a temple worthy wedding dress or alter what I bought to fit those modesty standards. He damn near had a coronary when he saw me in a sleeveless dress    In my not so humble opinion, unless he was paying for the dress, it is advisable that none of your likely objectionable family see the dress until they are seated with the crowd of strangers and you are walking down the aisle.    My brother wrongly assumed that since the small dinner we had planned after was at a nicer restaurant and not the church gym his kids weren't invited and got rather butt hurt over it for awhile.   I'll break type here and actually suggest that wasn't an unreasonable assumption on his part. It would have been extremely awkward if you had intended what he supposed, and then he just showed up with his kids anyway. It makes sense to be very specific about who is going to be invited to what.   My mom had problems with us writing our own vows instead of just saying yes to what the officiant said   Tough biscuits, mom. No one asked you. I'm getting married, not you.    My uncle got pissed that we weren't having a big gym reception with free food for his 8 kids and said he wouldn't come for the ceremony   Good riddance to bad rubbish.  I'd say you handled nearly everything admirably, with grace under fire.  My big question is: did you do and aisle walk, and if so, was there any kind of kerfuffle about your dad walking you down the aisle? How did or would you handle that?"
exmormon,3dsikh,YoungModern,4,Sun Jul 19 09:27:18 2015 UTC,"My dad had a few months to come around to the idea of a non-Mormon wedding and walked me down the aisle.

You would not believe how much is out there - I just had Bride magazine but you can have all kinds of blogs and websites, not to mention Pinterest.  Take a look at a few things and think about what you want.  We did the traditional things in both cultures.... I had an uncle who was an LDS bishop conduct a traditional ceremony like you see in movies except that things got sad and quiet over the ""until death do you part"" portion.    I recommend choosing a place you love and having a friend get certified to officiate, and/or writing your own vows.  Pick clothes that go with that. I'm pretty private, so I would only invite a few people and maybe do a destination wedding, like a Caribbean cruise (captain can marry you) or Hawaiian beach.  But my cousin invited everyone she knew to a big outdoor summer party with dancing after sunset and a buffet dinner/open bar.  You can do whatever fits your personality and budget - no need to include any tradition you don't like.  You'll hopefully have lots of fun planning.  Just don't make it too big or fuss too much.  And if you have a theme in mind... I'm sure my daughter has links to everything you might want - food, flowers, dresses, or decorations.  So do most LDS girls, or so she says.

exmormon,3dsikh,newnamemiriam,5,Sun Jul 19 13:11:38 2015 UTC,"I was in your same position. I was raised hardcore orthodox TBM by a large 100% TBM extended family. I am the first to break rank and leave, although other younger cousins are going to follow. My husband is a nevermo from a secular family, and almost all of our friends are irreligious or perhaps spiritual but unaffiliated. We got married on a boat. It solved a lot of problems. One, it was a great deal. We bought an all-inclusive wedding package that easily cost us half of what it would have been if we had hired the venue, caterer, florist, minister, DJ, etc. etc. separately. Additionally, it let us provide an experience for all of our friends and family, many of whom had nothing in common other than knowing us. We floated around San Francisco Bay for several hours, and everyone had a blast. I put teetotalers together at their own tables and explicitly informed the wait staff only to offer non-alcoholic beverages at those locations. The DJ played music off of our list and took audience requests, but I stipulated that only radio edits should play and no overtly sexual music was to be played. We were married by the captain, which is secular but very traditional and respectable from just about anyone's viewpoint.  The fact that our wedding was an activity (Look it's the Golden Gate Bridge! Angel Island! Alcatraz!) meant that people with incredibly opposite religious and political views were enjoying a common new experience and this gave them something to talk about. I would do my wedding exactly the same if I had to do it over again."

A wedding at an old timey B&B?  A wedding in the woods? Find a venue that makes you both happy and everyone will adjust.  Have a friend or family member get a quickie minister's license and have them tailor the wedding ceremony for you both.  I've been to several low budget weddings like this that were  beautiful,  touching and very, very happy events.  I hope yours will be too."
exmormon,3dsikh,president_furiosa,4,Sun Jul 19 01:52:38 2015 UTC,"I'd urge you to avoid a potential scene, manipulation, and added stress during an already naturally stressful time by totally excluding your family from the planning of your wedding. Don't even announce it to them. Just get all of your your ducks lined up in a row and then send them an invite like they were a colleague-acquaintance with the rest of your invites. Don't offer them any shred of an impression of possessing any power, control, input or influence which they might be tempted to wield."

It's been somewhat interesting to watch little cracks form on my mom's shelf over joyful inclusive weddings contrasted with exclusive somber sealings.  For example the most recent wedding I attended was at a children's museum and was inclusive of every member of the family regardless of age or religion obviously.  Another was in an old, beautiful movie theater with movie reel playing of the bride's and groom's story.  Demonstrate the celebratory nature of a wedding and merging two lives.  If you do a somewhat non-traditional wedding everyone will be somewhat out of their element so they won't be alone.  Your family may still choose to view your wedding negatively since it's not in the temple.  That's something they'll have to work through that you don't need to accept responsibility for.  Just be happy they get to be there and that everyone you want gets to be there and that feeling will spread through your wedding party."
exmormon,3dsikh,happilyheathen_67,3,Sun Jul 19 07:22:07 2015 UTC,Definitely hire a wedding planner if you can afford it.
exmormon,3dsikh,zaffiromite,2,Sun Jul 19 01:21:24 2015 UTC,"Destination Wedding   Pick a place without a Temple or nearby Mormon church. That way you can avoid schlepping about temple grounds for the Mormon relatives for pics. And no one will expect you use a dreadfully ugly Mormon chapel for the service or reception.   Destination wedding benefit #2 you can avoid terrible ward food donations. Jello salads, funeral potatoes and on gets made by local ward members and it's just kind of awful.  They mean well and if you're on a strict budget then I am so sorry if you have use this method...,  And  remember destination wedding does not have to mean fancy/stuffy/luxurious.  You do not have to fly out of state or even drive hours to a location.  There are beautiful and unique spots everywhere.  Many people choose to have the ceremony at one location , let say a gorgeous flower garden, and then resume for festivities and dinner at at a local restaurant or dining hall. It does not need to need to be elaborate or outrageous."
exmormon,3dsikh,happilyheathen_67,2,Sun Jul 19 02:32:00 2015 UTC,"While a destination wedding is wonderful if that's what they want, but it is utterly unnecessary to avoid temples and ward involvement.

exmormon,3dsikh,zaffiromite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:55:43 2015 UTC,"I may have completely missed what the post was about , if so my apologies.  I brought that up due to the fact that her family is Mormon . She said her family did not take her leaving the faith well and had specially brought up not having a temple wedding. It occurred to me that there may be pressure to somehow honor that part of her "" heritage"" or at least her families religious affiliation and push for something Mormonish.  It has been my experience that families often push to find some way to include their deeply held beliefs onto other people's moments. Said family extends offer to use their chapel for services along with the friends of the family donating food etc for the meal... where funeral potatoes or jello  might make an appearance...  I have  participated in quite a few weddings, despite the best intentions I have seen some families just bull doze the hell out of the bride and groom.  I think they may have meant well at some point but yikes."
exmormon,3dsikh,happilyheathen_67,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:42:03 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize, I'm not the op I'm just giving my understanding from what was said :).  But I have to ask do you think a Mormon parent would push to have an ""LDS reception"" in order to have something Mormonish?  It seems a bit odd in light of everything I've read from Mormons about weddings and receptions.  Weddings come up a lot and the disdain Mormons have for everything outside of Mormon weddings from the no temple wedding to the receptions is blatant.  Everything I've ever read from Mormons is contemptuous of non-LDS weddings."
exmormon,3dsikh,tscc5415,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:46:32 2015 UTC,"The disdain can be great.  That being said some parents/families just can't let go. Their desire to have a stamp on a portion of the event, to make a stand often outweighs reason. I have seen families create an entire separate event to make a point. It's just sad.  Hopefully the OP has a family that will respond to and respect her wishes.  Every bride and groom should have the experience they truly want."
exmormon,3dsikh,bananajr6000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:23:34 2015 UTC,Yep it's a fine line between helping and over stepping.

I've often seen people write about there is little beyond cake and punch.
exmormon,3dsikh,Zadok_The_Priest,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:42:45 2015 UTC,"The majority of Utah marriages I have seen looked like this:  Modest budget families:  A. Temple marriage Non temple holders wait outside with kids and extended family, Plus there is only so much room in the sealing room. Not everyone can be present.   B After temple ceremony pics on temple grounds with close friends and family ( lots of pics prior to wedding of of course for announcements etc)  C Meet back at the family's home ward for refreshments , light meal or buffet style   A wedding cake may be made by a friend or family member or has been budgeted in .   ""Ward family"" is often present to coordinate the food and serving etc.  D Many do the traditional receiving line but little else. I have never seen the tossing of the bouquet , garter belt etc. :)  No first dance ....  Ward members, neighbors stop by, eat , leave gifts etc.   These type of weddings have not featured dancing or bands. At least the dozens I have attended over the years.  Bigger budget Mormons:  Repeat A B  Rent a higher end location for dining   Caterer is usually present   With professional looking serving staff   Some type of music is present, string quartet or small band.   I've noticed more traditional speeches here  Implementing the first dance on occasion.  I live in southern Utah so it could be the locals are more reluctant to embrace change? Idk."

exmormon,3dtesg,Socratesgirl,4,Sun Jul 19 07:32:30 2015 UTC,Plato's theory of The Forms as discussed in the cave analogy and The Republic were later adapted into the Christian theory of God and creation.  I find it so ironic that its now used by so many to illustrate their journey out of christianity.

In this case, the allegory can be used to support religion or reject it. It all depends on the assumptions and biases with which you approach it. Neither is wrong. Neither implies a missed point. The story fits both points of view."
exmormon,3dtesg,TreeDigits,3,Sun Jul 19 13:46:54 2015 UTC,"Plato would disagree with you. He was trying to prove something very specific with the allegory of the cave, and that's the theory of forms. This is not open for interpretation. I guess what irks me about this is that people often use the story to make the exact opposite point that Plato intended. They remove it completely from the context of his overall philosophy. This is the same thing that Mormons do with certain sections of the bible, remove it from its context and bastardize it to fit their already held beliefs."

exmormon,3dqjp3,Caribou58,9,Sat Jul 18 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"We just watched a BBC film that was made for the tenth anniversary of the London tube/bus bombings, in which 52 people died and many were injured.  It was the true story of a female Church of England priest's experience - with her family - of finding out that her daughter was one of the dead.  I remarked to my partner afterwards that it was religion - pure and simple - that made the four bombers do what they did.  Any 'faith' that promises rewards in an afterlife in return for specific behaviours in this life is on the same continuum, in my opinion.  The film is called 'A song for Jenny' and I recommend it to anyone who can access BBC iplayer or other means of seeing recent BBC1 programmes."
exmormon,3dqjp3,vh65,6,Sat Jul 18 15:46:31 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I have developed almost a horror of religion - all religion, and largely for that reason.  Even Christianity, with people talking about the sacrificial death of some guy 2K years ago giving them meaning and a nice afterlife, comes across as creepy.  And I find most religions share a similar framework, you can just switch out the vocabulary.  And they inspire believers to do and say such crazy things.  I try really hard to let my family make up their own minds about religion, but it was sad to discover my youngest shares this.  She finds both prayer and chapels kind of creepy.  We did a tour of Stanford's expensive mock Italian Renaissance chapel and she found the decor and the worshippers a little scary.    I didn't imagine I would come to this - I wonder what's next?"

I got my fill of killing (0) and raping (0) in. I've met my stealing (0) and hurting people (0) quota.

He was an incredibly persuasive writer and thinker and if we want to put history in perspective and understand why things played out the way they did, it's a useful text to study. I mean, how many hours have all of us here spent analyzing the personalities of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young so that we can understand how Mormonism got so big and out of control? Those guys weren't even literally Hitler and we still find it useful to study how they thought.  So yeah, when you read Mein Kampf, one of the striking things about it is how not crazy some of it is. It's unnerving and makes the reader uncomfortable. But it also helps that person understand what happened in Germany in 1933."

We do not find it right when she presses into the world of men.   Adolf Hitler, quoted in Lucy Komisar, The New Feminism   A Volkisch state must therefore begin by raising marriage from the level of a continuous defilement of the race, and give it the consecration of an institution which is called upon to produce images of the Lord and not monstrosities halfway between man and ape.   Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Vol. 2 Chapter 2   They talk about the Spirit, but they allow man, as the embodiment of the Spirit, to degenerate to the proletarian level. Then they look on with amazement when they realize how small is the influence of the Christian Faith in their own country and how depraved and ungodly is this riff-raff which is physically degenerate and therefore morally degenerate also. To balance this state of affairs they try to convert the Hottentots and the Zulus and the Kaffirs and to bestow on them the blessings of the Church, while our European people, God be praised and thanked, are left to become the victims of moral depravity, the pious missionary goes out to Central Africa and establishes missionary stations for negroes. Finally, sound and healthy – though primitive and backward – people will be transformed, under the name of our 'higher civilization', into a motley of lazy and brutalized mongrels.   Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Vol. 2 Chapter 2   “Only in the steady and constant application of force lies the very first prerequisite for success. This persistence, however, can always and only arise from a definite spiritual conviction. Any violence which does not spring from a firm, spiritual base, will be wavering and uncertain.”   Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Vol. 1, Chapter 5   “The greatness of Christianity did not lie in attempted negotiations for compromise with any similar philosophical opinions in the ancient world, but in its inexorable fanaticism in preaching and fighting for its own doctrine.”   Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf, Vol. 1 Chapter 12"

I told her it was something we just joked about, but never really believed.  (Except we really did believe it, right fellas?)    She didn't like the fact that missionaries would think of women in such ""meaty"" terms.  Sadly to say, when I came off my mission I objectified women WAY more then I did before I left.    When you spend two formative years thinking every woman you meet is ""Delilah,"" you simply come to objectify them.  To me women became things, evil things.  That took me a few years after the mission to remedy/reprogram.    Turned out, most women didn't want to be told what to do just because I said so.  (Although there were many LDS women who gladly would.  God, they were brainless!)  My words and authority seemed to evaporate with the removal of the black tag.

exmormon,3drhj9,canadianjohnson,8,Sat Jul 18 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"This is handwaved in the the scriptures all the time.  It's part of the fictional world of the narrative.  The scriptures take place in a world where God speaks directly to men deliberately and unambiguously.  When Mormons discuss the morality of the Laban story, it is accepted as given that God gave the command.  That detail is not up for debate.  It's all about whether it was right to carry out the command.  In the real world, it's so obvious that God does not communicate this way that even President Newsroom admits it.  Any discussion of revelation always involves how and whether one can even recognize or identify when revelation has occurred.  There is no such thing as an unambiguous directive from God in the real world, and we all know it."
exmormon,3drhj9,Sophocles,3,Sat Jul 18 23:22:44 2015 UTC,"it is accepted as given that God gave the command   While in the actual story, it is completely different. No one commands Nephi to kill Laban. He justifies it in his own mind after some sweet talking from the spirit."
exmormon,3drhj9,TheNaturalMan,2,Sat Jul 18 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"He justifies it in his own mind after some sweet talking from the spirit.   Read the passage and tell me that the SpiritTM telling Nephi to kill Laban doesn't sound like when the devil tempted Jesus, rationalizing to make it seem like it's totally OK to commit the sin:   6 And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.  7 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he was drunken with wine.  8 And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.  9 And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel.   Nephi is clearly admiring the sword and maybe feeling covetous perhaps?    10 And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.   After practically lusting after the sword, ""the SpiritTM"" compels Nephi to kill Laban, but Nephi debates with his conscience.   11 And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away our property.   The SpiritTM (or Nephi's conscience?) rationalizes murdering a man in cold blood: Laban deserves to die after what he has done to you, god and your family.   12 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;   KILL HIM!   13 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.   The SpiritTM (Nephi's conscience) rationalizes murdering a man in cold blood a bit more. It's better that this man dies in vain (since the Nephites and Lamanites will dwindle in unbelief anyway) than for the Lord to magic-genie-blink the brass plates into Nephi's hands like he does with the Liahona.   14 And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise.   But, doesn't the Lord already know that they will not prosper? Isn't Joseph Smith already fore ordained to be the Prophet of the Restoration? If the Nephites prospered until 1830, why would there need to be a Restoration? Or were Elohim and Jehovah surprised that the Nephites didn't prosper in the land of promise? ""Uh, Joseph? Yeah, we're going to need you to go down and be the Prophet of the Restoration. Thaaanks.""   15 Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they should have the law. 16 And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass.  17 And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands for this cause—that I might obtain the records according to his commandments.   Apparently, Laban's brass plates are the only copy of the Torah or Tanakh in Jerusalem available to Nephi. Won't the Jews not leaving with Nephi dwindle in unbelief if Nephi takes the brass plates to America? Why can't the Lord direct Nephi to another set of brass plates? My head is starting to hurt.   18 Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own sword.   Let's do this! chop"

No copy of the Torah or Tanakh inscribed onto brass plates has ever been found, and of course, the ones mentioned in the BoM didn't exist either. There would have been plenty of paper copies.  The argument is that the Lehites needed a durable copy to survive the trip and to be an unchangeable copy to survive through the generations and all their trips through the wilderness."
exmormon,3drhj9,throwaway27374,2,Sun Jul 19 18:04:14 2015 UTC,"The the question I asked myself before leaving was, ""if the teachings of TSCC were true, what would the world look like?""  I mean, seriously, would you want ANY of the GAs being the general in charge of the armed forces, like in the BoM? And that's just one example. The Nephites didn't put prophets in charge because they gave speeches in church. They put them in charge because they had demonstrated prophetic abilities."
exmormon,3drhj9,rich-danny,7,Sun Jul 19 06:14:20 2015 UTC,"DA:  So, you're saying it was in self-defense?  Nephi:  Yes.  Three days ago he chased us out of his house, threatened us verbally, and sent people to kill us.  DA:  Were you or your brothers harmed in any way by Laban or his servants?  Nephi:  Well, no.  DA:  Where did you get that black eye then?  Nephi:  My brothers...  DA:  So, because Laban verbally threatened you several days earlier, you felt it was justifiable self-defense to decapitate him while he was passed out drunk?  Nephi:  Yes, that's correct.  DA:  And after you decapitated him, what did you do?  Nephi:  Well, I put on his blood-stained clothes and went to his house to get his brass plates.  That's why we were here in the first place.  DA:  Okay, so you came in from camping in the desert to 'acquire' Laban's property?  And he wouldn't give it to you and verbally threatened you and chased you away?  And then you snuck back into town at night, found him defenseless, chopped off his head, put on his bloody clothes, lied to his servant, stole his possessions, kidnapped his servant and ran back into the desert?

How else was he going to get the plates? But WAS it murder? Talk to many mormons and it is deemed righteous self defense because Laban had set out to kill them. If God tells you to get domething and the only way you can do it is through sin, is it really sin? Who decides what is sin anyways? I can go on forever, not being in a shower!"
exmormon,3drhj9,AnotherClosetAtheist,5,Sat Jul 18 21:29:17 2015 UTC,"Talk to many mormons and it is deemed righteous self defense because Laban had set out to kill them.   If they weren't in imminent danger or threat of being killed, it's not self defense.   If God tells you to get something and the only way you can do it is through sin, is it really sin?   No one and no thing ever commands Nephi to kill Laban. The spirit possesses Nephi and tries to use Nephi's body to kill Laban, but when Nephi resists (shrinks) from the task, the spirit sweet talks Nephi until Nephi justifies it in his own mind and then straight up murders a drunk, passed-out man. Saying it's okay to murder sometimes or when God commands it (which is not the case here) is moral relativism, which the COLDS decries as immoral.   Who decides what is sin anyways?   At the time, God had given the people Lehi's family belonged to the Mosaic Law, which included, ""Thou shalt not kill.""  Many Mormons would say that God's Law trumps man's law, but then they deny that the Lord will prepare a way for his commandments to be performed in righteousness, and the 12th Article of Faith. They also use it to justify illegal acts such as bigamy, polygamy, and anything else the Lord commands. Ask Mormons if they would kill their child as in an Abrahamic test if God commanded it, and a shocking percentage will answer that they will. An all-powerful God would have made sure polygamy was legal as part of the laws of the land before authorizing it."
exmormon,3drhj9,Flounder17,3,Sat Jul 18 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"Sophocles below has it exactly right. It's fiction, and as such it demands a certain level of suspension of disbelief.  Every genre of fictional narrative has its unwritten rules in this regard. When we watch action movies, we basically agree to ignore the fact that the hero is getting smacked around in ways that would kill someone in real life. In the Laban story, we're expected to make similar concessions -- that there's such a things as a ""spirit"" whose voice you can trust as reliable, that you can decapitate someone without getting blood all over their clothing (so that you can use it yourself as a disguise), etc., etc.  The fact that you have to make these concessions when reading the BoM is one of the many reasons -- along with the horses and steel swords, the KJV errors, the DNA issues, and all the rest -- that you know it's fiction.  To put it another way, certain things only happen in stories. Only in stories does it happen that two vast armies fight each other to the very last man. Only in stories do the final two combatants turn out to be the two leaders (i.e., Coriantumr and Shiz).  For people to read of such things and think they are NOT reading fiction is just childish."

Even if you don't like AA, taking a step toward freeing yourself of alcoholism is what matters.  Maybe down the road, you'll find another avenue, but for now take this one.  Please report back....but not within two hours, or I'll know you didn't attend the meeting ;). Seriously (((((you))))."

Take the God stuff with a grain of salt. From what I have briefly read, AA as a program is not super-effective, but you should consider it as a starting point. It's probably much better than advice from a layman.  If it works for you, great. If you need more, seek out a licensed therapist who deals with addiction."

exmormon,3dr2ex,EcstasyMan,3,Sat Jul 18 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"I am addicted to prescription stimulants. I openly acknowledge it.  I went a year without it and the entire year was hell. When Robin Williams was saying that you just don't ever get over it, I felt horrible because I know what he meant...  Granted that stimulants and alcohol have different properties, the concept of dealing with addiction is the same... except there are medications that can help alcoholics and none for the amphetamine/cocaine folks.  Here's the deal, you have a compulsive problem...get it treated NOW. Get the compulsion to binge taken care of and then you can far more easily deal with the physical addiction.  Never quit cold turkey. Just slowly back off until you are drinking no more than one a day. If you have to, buy a single drink and then drink it at home so you limit yourself with inconvenience. Then go to 5 a week and just stay there if it makes you happy.  You don't have to abstain as long as you can control the compulsion to get shit-faced. If you can't control that compulsion, then you are  going to need medical help to kick the physical addiction and you just can't drink ever again.  Unlike you, I don't have the alcoholic gene.  My addiction is purely physical. I just can't imagine how you must feel when you lose control. It sounds awful and I truly hope you can find some people who can relate to that aspect.  Social interaction is very powerful and can help people get clean and stay that way.  Even addicted mice will give up cocaine etc once placed in a socially and mentally fulfilling environment!  Best of luck to you. You can PM me if you ever just need to vent."

exmormon,3dr2ex,tdiggle,5,Sat Jul 18 21:27:00 2015 UTC,AA is as much a cult as the LDS church.  In fact it was partly due to my cult research on AA that allowed me to start to see that my own religion was a fraud.  I would absolutely recommend looking to the other resources suggested by others.

I noticed some of your questions were already answered with things I would have said so I'll add  http://aaagnostica.org/  and, more importantly see a counselor or therapist to help you explore some healthier coping mechanisms for social anxiety and whatever ails you.  I'm no expert, but I've decide for myself that my personal boundary with alcohol is if I'm using it as a way to deal with my feelings, even for relaxation, it's a red flag.

exmormon,3dr2ex,inthe801,3,Sat Jul 18 18:30:14 2015 UTC,Glad you're not interested in AA. That shit's just another cult.
exmormon,3dr2ex,Saintedsinner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that you'll find AA to be too similar to going to Mormon church to be able to internalize and trust it. There is a lot of dogma that is socially reinforced. You can even have a sponsor regularly check up on you. If you've ever had a bishop do similar for ""tempations,"" then you'll feel similarly. I'm afraid that curing your drinking problem in this way will remind you too much of what you're trying to escape in the first place.  That said, DO try to do something. Anything. Maybe AA this week, maybe you springboard into mental health counseling next week. I personally am working on my own drinking problem using self-help books and focused introspection. I don't recommend you flying solo like I'm trying to, but I will recommend you read the following books as you work on your drinking, no matter what path you choose:   Allen Carr - Easy Way to Control Drinking (sounds gimmicky, but it presents very logical and intuitive reasoning about alcohol that's meant to change the way you think about drinking). William James - Talks For Teachers (has a lot of information on concepts such as perception and free will that actually formed the basis of American psychology). Noah Elkrief - A Guide to the Present Moment (I just began reading it; I suggest foraying into Buddhism and meditation as alternative to the end that you seek via drinking).   Thoughts beget actions, and actions beget thoughts. I suggest you create two goals for yourself: think about drinking like healthy drinkers do, and drink like healthy drinkers do. Be realistic about what you can expect from drinking before you begin, and drink an appropriate amount in an appropriate setting. Hopefully you can learn how to have a few drinks without going overboard. If not, you should be prepared to give it up entirely. Compared to everything else life has to offer, you wouldn't be missing out on much.  If you ever need someone to talk to, PM me. My drinking habits also involved being stubborn after legal trouble and drinking until I can't anymore (alcohol is all gone or I'm passed out). I'm still a work in progress but I'm in a much better place than I was a few months ago."

I am 5 years sober now and yup it was through AA in Utah County no less, and we have a LGBTQ meeting. Not sure where you are at, but for Utah it is mandatory AA and AA related treatment is required for DUI's and many states have adopted this idea.

exmormon,3dr2ex,dannyrodge,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:49 2015 UTC,"As an alternative to ""faith in God"", I suggest educating yourself about addiction - the physical and psychological aspects of it.  Knowing what's occurring in your brain is a HUGE tool for working through addiction or substance abuse issues -- especially realizing that there are neurochemical things occurring that are not your choice, and that your body has an amazing ability to heal itself from addiction.  You'll be taught that you're a weak addict and that you don't have the ability to control your addiction without ""higher"" help.  The truth (proven through numerous studies) is that most addicts eventually triumph over their addiction, and it's usually without the aid of expensive rehabs.  I think you'll find that connecting with other people struggling with addiction has a similar positive effect as this sub has for people struggling with faith issues.   Please PM me if you ever need someone to talk to about it.    Best of luck!"

exmormon,3dssvt,frednecksburg,4,Sun Jul 19 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, lds.org has put together a compendium which consistently and utterly refutes the possibility of prophetic fallibility.    “I bear witness to the world today that more than a century and a half ago the iron ceiling was shattered; the heavens were once again opened, and since that time revelations have been continuous. …  “Since that momentous day in 1820, additional scripture has continued to come, including the numerous and vital revelations flowing in a never-ending stream from God to his prophetsnext time some slippery apologist tries to weasel around this by mocking ""the deluge of revelation"" [Daniel C. Petersen, Mike Tannehill et al.] you can flip this in their face on the earth. …  “… We testify to the world that revelation continues and that the vaults and files of the Church contain these revelations which come month to month and day to daydaily revelation but never a word about their error on the African people?. We testify also that there is, since 1830 when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized, and will continue to be, so long as time shall last, a prophet, recognized of God and his people, who will continue to interpret the mind and will of the Lord.   -Spencer W. Kimball   Sixth: The prophet does not have to say “Thus saith the Lord” to give us scripture.  Sometimes there are those who argue about words. They might say the prophet gave us counsel but that we are not obliged to follow it unless he says it is a commandment. But the Lord says of the Prophet, “Thou shalt give heed unto all his words and commandments which he shall give unto you.” (D&C 21:4.)  Said Brigham Young, “I have never yet preached a sermon and sent it out to the children of men, that they may not call scripture.” (Journal of Discourses, 13:95.)  President Marion G. Romney tells of this incident which happened to him:  “I remember years ago when I was a bishop I had President Heber J. Grant talk to our ward. After the meeting I drove him home … Standing by me, he put his arm over my shoulder and said: ‘My boy, you always keep your eye on the President of the Church and if he ever tells you to do anything, and it is wrong, and you do it, the Lord will bless you for it.’ Then with a twinkle in his eye, he said, ‘But you don’t need to worry. The Lord will never let his mouthpiece lead the people astray.’” (Conference Report, October 1960, p. 78.)   -Ezra Taft Benson in the Fourteen Fundamentals of Following the Prophet  President Wilford Woodruff declared that we can have full confidence in the direction the prophet is leading the Church:   “The Lord will never permit me or any other man who stands as President of this Church to lead you astray. It is not in the programme. It is not in the mind of God. If I were to attempt that, the Lord would remove me out of my place, and so He will any other man who attempts to lead the children of men astray from the oracles of God and from their duty” (Official Declaration 1, “Excerpts from Three Addresses by President Wilford Woodruff Regarding the Manifesto”; emphasis added).  President Harold B. Lee taught this same principle: “You keep your eye upon him whom the Lord called, and I say to you now, knowing that I stand in this position, you don’t need to worry about the President of the Church ever leading people astray, because the Lord would remove him out of his place before He would ever allow that to happen” (The Teachings of Harold B. Lee, ed. Clyde J. Williams [1996], 533).  President Gordon B. Hinckley gave similar assurance to Church members: “The Church is true. Those who lead it have only one desire, and that is to do the will of the Lord. They seek his direction in all things. There is not a decision of significance affecting the Church and its people that is made without prayerful consideration, going to the fount of all wisdom for direction. Follow the leadership of the Church. God will not let his work be led astray” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1983, 68–69; or Ensign, Nov. 1983, 46; emphasis added)."

exmormon,3dris2,from_ether_side,6,Sat Jul 18 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"I think I know a little of what you're going through. A month ago I blessed my infant son and just had to get through it. Family was visiting and I had to wear a mask the whole weekend. My TBM DW knows I have concerns, but not the depth of my disbelief.   May I ask what your trying to make it through to? I haven't figured out my long term plan and I could use any advice you have to give."
exmormon,3dris2,drinkerton,4,Sat Jul 18 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot of reading and podcast listening and thinking over the past 6 months since my awakening, and I have a rough, blurry plan.  For some context, I have 5 kids, been married 11 years, and my relationship with my wife has always been more of a relationship with the church and her parents, even though we have quite a bit in common.  What I mean is that we have never really emotionally connected, and we totally suck at communication.  Whenever I can tell she is in an emotional state, and I ask her about it, she just says, ""I think I'm just tired.""    My first goal is to try to build up our relationship. This task is monumentally difficult because trust broke down when I revealed some of my concerns.  We really haven't talked much about important things. We're just roommates.  And I feel that I can't open up much to her because it will likely cause her some pain, and she will run to her parents and friends to seek healing, which I fear will drive a wedge between us.  So I have been trying very hard to have empathy for her. There are lots of good posts on here for example empathetic thoughts.  I have listened to several Mormon Stories podcasts that deal specifically with marriage and relationships with TBMs when you are exmo or NOM.  I don't have time right this minute to list all the resources I have found helpful, but perhaps I should compile a list as a sort of survival guide for people in this situation.  Almost all of my plan comes from Dehlin's podcasts.  The rest of it is from the book Crucial Conversations, and from many good posts on /r/exmormon.  So what I'm working toward now is having more conversations with her that have nothing to do with church stuff at first.  Just building our relationship.  I'll teach her about perspectives, how people can have completely opposite perspectives and both are valid. Then we will try an empathy-building exercise where we each write down what it must be like to live with ourself, trying to see things from the other's perspective.  I don't think we will share those with each other right away, but writing them down helps.  Then we'll talk about how strong our relationship is: Physically, Intellectually, Emotionally, and Spiritually. And we'll talk about why it's strong or why it's weak in each category.  After that we'll talk about values. I wrote down a bunch of values that I find important even after my awakening, and I will invite her to write down her values independently. Then we will share with each other what we value and find common values.    All this time I will be trying to be the best husband I can be. I have been helping around the house and with the kids more, and staying up late to help with projects that are stressing her out.  I haven't been perfect. Now and again depression rises up a little and I have to sort of isolate myself and play video games or something to escape for a little bit. And I don't think she likes seeing me play video games much, but it's either that or go deeper into depression.  I think she sees my depression sometimes, but simply doesn't have the tools to help. I imagine she believes that the church has the answer to everything, and that I just need to believe a little more to find peace again.    At some point I will start talking about changes that I have had since my awakening, and at first a primary focus on the positive changes. Here is a list of positive changes I have noticed in myself so far.   I now care so much more about the earth and being responsible with the resources we have.  Before I used to think, well, Jesus will come cleanse things, so it doesn't really matter in the end if we trash the earth. I feel so much more capable of empathy and compassion. This was especially true for the first week after my perspective changed.  When I read a story of somebody suffering, I too feel pain and often cry.  Before then I almost never cried, and really can't say that I understood what they must be feeling. I feel freedom to think.  I can think about anything.  I'm not afraid to have thought experiments and ""what ifs"" that I would before have considered blasphemous or critical of church leaders.  I can really think about both sides of issues and look at evidence for both sides of issues and make informed choices. I feel less of a desire to control our kids.  I'm comfortable with teaching them to think about what will happen as a result of their decisions and letting them choose what they want.  I am not afraid that they will be ""lost to sin."" Science and astronomy are SO much more interesting to me now.  I can't fall back on the ""because God made it that way"" response.  I try to dig deeper. I feel much more accepting of others.  I finally feel like I understand what unconditional love is. I'm not worried that they will taint me with their ""evil spirit"" or that they will try to hurt me or something.  We're all just people. I can see so much more the importance of relationships.  I want to change in good ways, but I'm worried that change will scare you, that you might interpret some of the changes as negative even though I think they will be positive.   And then at some point I will talk about what I want for our relationship and changes I need to make in my life.  I really want our relationship to be stronger and to be able to discuss things openly.  Ideally she will be open to working with a marriage counselor, I haven't touched that idea yet with her.  If she's not open to it, then I will try to be empathetic and take things slow, much as I already have.  I will basically say something like this:  I love you so much, no matter what. I love you not because you are mormon, but because you are you. I did not mean to hurt you, and I still do not mean to hurt you. My concerns about the church have nothing to do with you, and I am still committed to our marriage and kids.  I want you to be happy, and I want our kids to be happy. I understand that you love the church. If it makes you happy and you want to be a part of it, then I support you.  It is very difficult for me to keep the level of activity I have in the church right now. It causes me pain, and it is getting harder to fight off depression.  I have tried praying and reading scriptures and doing all the little things I am supposed to do, but it just makes it worse.    I want you to be happy and believe the things that help you be the person you want to be. I deserve the same respect. I would never ask you to change your beliefs for me. Belief is personal. We are married, but we are still individuals with individual ideas. I cannot just adopt your testimony. I want you to be happy because I love you for who you are.  I know that this is scary and confusing, but I have to make some changes in my life.  I have spent a tremendous amount of time learning about the church over the past 6 months. I learned so many things I had never known before.  I feel betrayed by the leaders of our church past and present. There are a lot of things that concern me, and I know that this is also scary for you.  If you don't want to talk about these concerns, that's fine. What's important to me is our relationship and our family.  I feel that my continuing to attend church in full activity goes against my own personal integrity and standing up for what I feel is right.  The first change I need to make is to scale back my participation in church activity, starting in the home.  If you want to continue to read scriptures with the kids, that is fine, but I would like to not be a part of that anymore.  We can work it out gradually, but I after 1 month I will not be reading scriptures with you.  I would love to read something with the family, some kind of chapter book or something, because I like the idea of doing something with the family daily, but anything church related simply causes me pain.  I am still ok with joining in prayer.  And so on.  Other things I will want to change are church calling activity, then church attendance.  Since we still have wee ones, I could be persuaded to stay for sacrament meeting until they get a little older, but certainly not the other meetings.  This will be a negotiation, not an ultimatum.  I really want to try attending the Unitarian church (conveniently walking distance), not so much for believing, but just to have someone around who accepts me as I am.  I am afraid that this will be scary to DW, so it's not the first thing I'm going to bring up.  Of course I also want to try coffee and eventually some alcohol, and ditch garments, but I can wait a bit longer for those.    Once my activity in church is as low as I can get it, I will support DW in going, and I will try very hard not to attack the church.  I might plant a small seed here and there, but not directly about the church.  Other things like vaccination (she's pretty passionate about that) and science.  I will wait for her to come to me with questions, and boy will I be ready to welcome her with lots of hugs and crying."

Much more important is giving your daughter self confidence, exposing her to all kinds of role models (hint: some working women to balance out the LDS SAHMs), and helping her build critical thinking skills.  Turns out my dad was a NOM when he baptized me - it's just a vague memory counterbalanced by years of Sunday science and philosophy discussions.  Pretty obvious which won out."

exmormon,3drys7,pinkdresscannabis,5,Sat Jul 18 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"Look over on the sidebar under resources for missionaries and resources for those in need.  I'm wondering if you might qualify for Job Corps? If you are interested in a college education and think you can handle that, you might qualify for financial aid even if you are under 26 and your parents won't help.  Be very careful, however, in choosing a school.  Many will help homeless people get government loans and grants and toss them out without a useful degree once they can't qualify for loans.  A good state community college or 4-year public college would be better, as would some private schools.  There are numerous scholarships for LGTB folks.  Be very careful hopping trains and hanging out in homeless camps.  One of our own, also kicked out by conservative religious parents, was murdered in a homeless camp in Alaska last month.  He had options but chose to travel, in spite suffering apparently 4 untreated fractures through his experiences.  It's a very tough environment; please try to stay safe."

The people who wear them either do so to follow a certain standard, or they don't.  A person who claims to be Mormon and has gone so far as to wear garments - that person is a hypocrite if they behave in the way this person has.  Hypocrisy is ""the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform"".  The word clearly fits in this case."
exmormon,3dr53g,filologo,0,Sat Jul 18 23:27:17 2015 UTC,"The mere mention of ""I believe in the Mormon church"" is not a statement that claims that a person claims to have a certain set of moral standards or beliefs. If you think that it is then that is only because you are making assumptions about that person.  Mormonism likes to preach that belief is black and white, that either you try to adhere to everything that it preaches, or you are the exact opposite of everything that it preaches. This is a big part of their brainwashing efforts. It isn't very realistic either, and the only people who believe in that concept are hardcore TBMs and many exmormons. The reality is that people pick and choose what they want to believe and the ignore things that they don't want to believe. Every religious person on the planet does this and everybody draws the line in the sand a little bit differently.  There is a line that separates Mormon church rules and the way real people act in real situations. Even though the Mormon church likes to claim otherwise, Mormons rarely toe the line."
exmormon,3dr53g,SalzRide,4,Sat Jul 18 23:39:19 2015 UTC,"Um, this guy was wearing garments.  That's a little bit different than merely mentioning ""I believe in the Mormon church"".

Again, you don't get to decide what this person's code is any more than the Mormon church leaders get to decide what that person's code is.   Um, this guy was wearing garments. That's a little bit different than merely mentioning ""I believe in the Mormon church"".   Not really. People do culturally acceptable things for dozens of reasons. Some of those reasons are that they want to adopt certain codes of conduct. Other reasons are so that they can be more accepted by the community. It means nothing unless the person wants it to mean something.  The Mormon church preaches that it is very important and represents certain things. Frankly the Mormon church is wrong all of the time and they don't have as much power as some folks here think they do."
exmormon,3dr53g,SalzRide,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:56:47 2015 UTC,"Then, well, consider that he's not Mormon then.  He's some other sort of religion, self-styled, that's fashioned after Mormonism.    It's hard for anyone to say really because in the context of this story, we are only getting the viewpoint of the non-Mormon woman.  His exact intentions and ambitions for what he is trying to do by 1) wearing garments and 2) having sex outside marriage (and with a non-member, no less) aren't given.  Edit:  I was thinking about this.  Why a non-member?  It's almost like he's split himself in two; like he has a double-life.  One where he is Mr. Upstanding Mormon, and one where he is this other person who does the other things the Mormon version of him finds unacceptable.  It's not unheard of, this duplicity."
exmormon,3dr53g,filologo,0,Sun Jul 19 01:05:34 2015 UTC,"No, it certainly isn't unheard of (the duplicity). But again, it can't be assumed. It seems like you are wanting to say that if he has a code of ethics that allows him to have premarital sex then he isn't Mormon. The thing is that we don't get to decide that for him. As much as they preach that they can, Mormon leaders don't get to do that either. Only he can decide that.  My only point is that it is possible and sometimes likely that a person can do this and not be a hypocrite. We shouldn't believe the story that Mormon leaders tell us about Mormons being either all in or all out. It isn't a true representation of Mormon people."
exmormon,3dr53g,SalzRide,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:20:37 2015 UTC,"You are talking about some outlier then.  Yeah, not to say it couldn't exist some weirdo is out there wearing garments who isn't Mormon who also has sex as part of his lifestyle, but I doubt that's the case here because the person telling the story says he claimed he was.  This is hypocrisy pretty much no matter how you slice it."

Utah YSA Bishop 2012 - Gave me Miracle of Forgiveness. Told me I could change.  Utah SP 2012 - Gave me outdated church pamphlets. Told me he knew a therapist that could change me (I declined). Later didn't believe me in 2013 that mormonsandgays.org existed/was church official.  Mission President 2013 - Asked what I planned to do about it. Was then enthusiastic about my resolve (at the time) to remain celibate.  Utah Family Ward Bishop 2013 - Told me I could do anything with a guy that I could also do within the law of chastity with a girl.  Utah YSA Bishop 2014 - Encouraged a church-approved lifestyle, but could understand if I didn't want that.  Arizona YSA Bishop 2014 - Proceeded to draw a diagram of the slippery slope of healthy sexuality into sexual perversion. It started with kissing, making out, heavy petting, etc. Homosexuality was on the slope AFTER adultery, and led to the only two worse perversions of pedophilia and finally bestiality.  I'd already been dating guys for months before Arizona, and began listening Mormon Stories while I was there. But man, that bishop was one of the last straws before I stopped going to church."

I think his logic was that if you slip to the next degree of perversion, it's because the previous one wasn't doing it for you anymore.

His next question:  ""Have you had sex with (my younger brother)?""  I get angry every time I remember this, because I wish I would have responded by asking him if he'd ever had sex with his sister.  He was a total dick about everything and all of his advise about what to do moving forward made things much worse.  Second bishop I told was in the same ward but was the new bishop, a year later when I was preparing to leave on a mission, just so he would be aware of my situation and that I had been chaste for a year and was worthy.  He was totally cool.  Bishop roulette."

The only church leader I ever respected and still have a fond memory of.       From the on, the rest did not know what to do with me. One in Provo sent me to social services for counseling,  another dumped me on the SP and let him deal with me.... others just offered their opinion on what I should do (date women, keep busy with callings, pray, study..yada yada yada).

Please don't mention the sub though as I'm not out about my disbelief and they know people on my ward. Don't worry, there aren't any TBMs as far as I'm aware."
exmormon,3dok0j,strippingworrior,62,Sat Jul 18 07:27:25 2015 UTC,I would love to talk but I'm actually in Spain right now visiting my family over summer break. Luckily the embassy has counsellors on staff for us to talk to. Thank you for the support.

I'm glad you have help readily available. You may not need it right away, but knowing it's there will be comforting down the road. If you ever need to vent (about anything) feel free to pm, any time of day or night.  ::hugs::"
exmormon,3dok0j,azhurem,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:40:33 2015 UTC,Is it possible your parents were also a significant factor?  Was mental illness a factor?

exmormon,3dok0j,MrSelatcia,29,Fri Jul 17 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"I am so so sorry for you  I'm not homosexual but I feel like my sexuality has been ruined by the things that they taught me and the way my family treated me because of them, I feel broken inside and unable to connect with other people, I spend a lot of time trying to numb my mind and forget everything, I've gotten close to... I've wondered if that was the original purpose of meditation to escape, last night as I was trying to drown everything out the thought entered my mind that the reason that it is so hard to think about nothing is because everything exists and nothing does not and I felt an intense desire to embrace life and enjoy it  Wounds cannot heal while they are still being inflicted, I feel I will only feel true closure when I know that this evil organization is no longer harming society  maybe in helping those still suffering as she did to understand they have nothing to be ashamed of you can find peace  I'm still searching for it"

We're here for you and love you and your family.   Please talk to someone. My heart goes out to you and your family.   None of this is your fault, or your parents' fault. It should not have happened, and I'm so sorry that it had happened. I've been on both sides of this coin before and it's painful no matter how you look at it.

exmormon,3dok0j,ckb2,10,Fri Jul 17 23:57:00 2015 UTC,Sorry.  That is nothing but shitty.  As a father myself this is my biggest nightmare.  I have a 16yo that has some depreesion and anxiety.  He is in counseling and I hope for a good outcome.  Reading your description of your father is absolutely horrible.  I'm sure you're collapsed as well.  Again sorry.
exmormon,3dok0j,Extra_Daft_Benson,10,Sat Jul 18 03:13:17 2015 UTC,"First off I would like to say I am very sorry for your loss. My heart goes out to you and your family during this difficult time. When I read this I would like to say that I was surprised to see this related to the church, but I'm not. The church pushes its youth too hard and do absolutely nothing about bullying in the church. This is a serious issue and the church has done nothing about it. Me being a youth have had thoughts about taking my life because of the church and how I'm treated there. I'm very sorry about your loss. The church does not have its priorities straight, they need to focus on the youth more than ""very strongly suggesting"" that men need to go on missions and spend all of there money on Missionary work and think about there youth! The youth have many issues and it makes me so very sad! Reeding this breaks my heart. I am so very sorry for your loss."

My father took his own life when I was only thirteen, and I now look back and attribute a lot of the pain that he suffered toward his ""inability"" to live up to his priesthood duties. I know from personal experience that nothing that anyone says can make the pain go away, but I certainly appreciated how loving everyone around me was. It's nearly eleven years later and I still feel the pain every day, but I can promise you that time will progressively heal your heart. Growing up without a father was incredibly difficult, but I learned so many things as a result. Keep those that you love close, despite your potential differences. My heart goes out to you tonight. Please feel free to PM me. I am not a professional, but I am always open to discussion with those that are suffering."

exmormon,3dok0j,DuckOFace,6,Sat Jul 18 04:55:38 2015 UTC,"Jenkobay, today is most likely the worst day of your life, which means that tomorrow will not be the worst day of your life, and the next day will not be quite as bad as tomorrow will be. There will be a lot of really bad days ahead of you, but each one will be a little bit better than the last, and though you may always carry the pain of losing your dear sister, you will one day get to the point where you'll be able to live with that pain peacefully and live a very happy life, looking back on memories of her with joy. Your anger towards the church is absolutely justified. My heart has ached at the pain it has caused so many people and families ever since I came out as gay publicly a couple of years ago and started getting involved in raising awareness within the church. I am no longer Mormon and haven't been for years, but I refuse to sit around and watch so many members of the church spread so much hatred and pain without doing something about it. So I've worked on spreading messages of unconditional love and acceptance to members in a way that is respectful and inviting to them so they will listen. ldswalkwithyou.org is one of those projects I've been involved with. There's a video interview on there of a brother who was in a very similar situation as you are now. I'm sending you love and comfort. I hope all gets better for you and your family."

I promise you that while the pain never goes completely away, it will get easier with time. Please take care of yourself right now and give yourself time and space, not blame. I'm sure you were the best sibling she could have asked for.  I know there are lots of us who have offered to listen if you need to talk, and you can add me to the list. My inbox is always open.

I have no words to say that will even make up for what happened or to bring you any comfort at all and what I can say is that, like everyone else in this sub, I am so, so deeply sorry for your loss and I add my voice as support to you at any time.  I don't know what she went through or how she felt because I'm not her but I do understand what it is to be gay in the church, to feel worthless because I'll never have those promises they claim, and I do feel the incredible pain of figuring out my sexuality and my (then) religious beliefs. The one thing I can tell you is that it's not your fault, nor your parents', they're probably struggling with that and it will eat them alive (that's how my mom put it when I told her about my depression and all the other issues). I share that anger towards the church and its teachings for making us feel like that and at this horrible time, I hope you and your parents don't have that guilt that will only make things worse. I don't know if I make sense, sorry if I didn't.   Someone else said it and as clichéd as I find it, it's true: take it one day at the time. Don't think long term, just think about getting through today.  Once again, I'm so sorry for your loss. I love you and your sister and remember the good times you had together. Even if you need to yell, vent, whatever, you have this strange guy from Reddit that will be happy to hear you. Big hugs."

As her older brother, it's natural that you feel you should have protected her more, loved her more, anything'd more...I hope someday you understand that you couldn't have, no matter how much you wanted to.  In her short traumatic life, she obviously knew that you loved her & she knew she could trust you. She talked to you. That's a gift you gave her every day. Peace be with you."

Now I guess I don't really mean that but the suicide rates are still awful and I hope every bigoted loud-mouthed Mormon feels the weight of every TBM or exmo suicide."
exmormon,3dok0j,Smartare,3,Sat Jul 18 07:14:21 2015 UTC,"I am so deeply sorry for all of you.    It's the good, loving tender-hearted people who find the world so tough and can't deal with it. Knowing how caring and special they were and how much they had to share that they never got to is part of what makes it so painful.  But you must tell yourself that her pain is over now.    I know we wonder if they just got through the tough part would life have had more to offer them.  Was it a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  But then we can only guess at how deep their hurt and self-doubt was so we must be happy for them that it's done.  You have to be happy for her so you can go on and continue to love her without the pain it causes you and you have to be happy that you were one of the few privileged people  who got to know how very special and wonderful she was.    I am sending you all of my love for this hard time when it's all so raw and hoping you can move on to the time when her short life will be a happy memory."
exmormon,3dok0j,victorestupadre,2,Sat Jul 18 07:38:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know what I believe about an afterlife or what happens after death, but whatever it is I hope her pain is gone. And yeah I think maybe if I had invited her to go out somewhere with me or to watch a movie with me the night before she would still be here. But I know that what she was dealing with was much deeper than that. Thank you for the kind words"
exmormon,3dok0j,wildonrio,4,Sat Jul 18 07:41:52 2015 UTC,"NO.  If you invited her to a movie or something she would have loved you but it would NOT have changed her perspective on what life had in store for her.    Here's the hard truth:  there is NOTHING you could have done.  NOTHING you failed to do.  Some people are not equipped for life on this planet.  They are dear, dear people but they never had a chance.    I'm sure she treasured you and never, never, never wanted you to feel the way you do now but she couldn't help it.  She just wasn't equipped for this world.  I personally don't believe in any afterlife but I DO believe that they had to deal with their pain and we can't know what it was, we can only know that they're not in pain anymore.  And we shouldn't be either!  It isn't what they wanted.  It won't change anything.    It looks like I am in a relatively similar time zone.  I'll stay on my computer.  You can talk to me."
exmormon,3dok0j,I_see_clearly_now,3,Sat Jul 18 07:51:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you are saying. We had just spent a great week at the beach surfing, her favorite thing to do. I have never seen her happier than when she was surfing. And the next day when we got home she did it. I don't think I could have saved her by doing something like the movies, it's just one of those thoughts that won't get out of your head. Luckily I have an appointment to talk to someone already, so it's something I'll be sure to bring up to them."
exmormon,3dok0j,Agent_of_Ilum,7,Sat Jul 18 07:59:17 2015 UTC,"She was happy because she had already decided to take control of her life and end her pain.  She chose to spend that day with you being happy, doing something she loved with someone she loved.   She was saying good-bye to you.  She was leaving you with that memory.  She loved you and she wanted to leave you with that.  Let her have that:  be happy.  It could be her greatest accomplishment.  It's really very beautiful  Let it be.  For you and for her."

exmormon,3dqhym,ExConned,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"I meant Satan's plan. The one discussed in PoGP to save all spirit children of Elohim by taking their agency. (Moses 4).  Afterwards there was a war in heaven. Prominent racist Joseph F. Smith wrote that spirits who were fence sitters in the war in heaven, are assigned to negroe bodies (Way to Perfection -sorry no page number as my library is 100 km away-written as junior apostle- now church disavows this as opinion). I recently learned that earlier church leaders taught this and it was borrowed from contemporary protestant teachings (from the Bushman AMA on r/latterdaysaints), but haven't seen firsthand yet. Either way, they actively taught that we are placed in race and families according to our merits in pre-mortal life. For an example, read the first presidency response to Stewart Udall, a Mormon secretary of the interior from AZ. It is the subject of a recent post in this sub.  Anyhow this is a war of spirits with no bodies, and is often alluded to as a war of words and opinions, including in the gospel doctrine teachers manual. So really the church was discriminating against 'descendants of Cain' for failing to express an opinion in their previous lives.  A 'Jofus' cartoon from r/kolob makes the same joke I did here:  http://i.imgur.com/QfdYd.png  Also my comment is really just expanding on OP's point.  My comment can be understood in the context of what I have written above. Without setting up a pole it is impossible to say for sure, but this disavowed racist explanation for why blacks are black and did not get the priesthood, is not obscure or relatively unknown doctrine. At least not in exmormon or historically minded tbm circles. It is the philosophy that underpinned one of the most shameful policies in church history."

exmormon,3dr581,sushi_hamburger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:03:32 2015 UTC,"The following is a copy and paste of my reply in another thread. It works here too.  Read the passage and tell me that the SpiritTM telling Nephi to kill Laban doesn't sound like when the devil tempted Jesus, rationalizing to make it seem like it's totally OK to commit the sin:   6 And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.  7 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he was drunken with wine.  8 And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.  9 And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel.   Nephi is clearly admiring the sword and maybe feeling covetous perhaps?    10 And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.   After practically lusting after the sword, ""the SpiritTM"" compels Nephi to kill Laban, but Nephi debates with his conscience.   11 And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away our property.   The SpiritTM (or Nephi's conscience?) rationalizes murdering a man in cold blood: Laban deserves to die after what he has done to you, god and your family.   12 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;   KILL HIM!   13 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.   The SpiritTM (Nephi's conscience) rationalizes murdering a man in cold blood a bit more. It's better that this man dies in vain (since the Nephites and Lamanites will dwindle in unbelief anyway) than for the Lord to magic-genie-blink the brass plates into Nephi's hands like he does with the Liahona.   14 And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise.   But, doesn't the Lord already know that they will not prosper? Isn't Joseph Smith already fore ordained to be the Prophet of the Restoration? If the Nephites prospered until 1830, why would there need to be a Restoration? Or were Elohim and Jehovah surprised that the Nephites didn't prosper in the land of promise? ""Uh, Joseph? Yeah, we're going to need you to go down and be the Prophet of the Restoration. Thaaanks.""   15 Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they should have the law. 16 And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass.  17 And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands for this cause—that I might obtain the records according to his commandments.   Apparently, Laban's brass plates are the only copy of the Torah or Tanakh in Jerusalem available to Nephi.

exmormon,3du0ev,Oldklunker,15,Sun Jul 19 13:30:03 2015 UTC,"How are they even remotely comparible? Exmormons in general don't:  Tell you what to think or how to think.  Present facts over faith.  Don't have an organized leadership or form of government (sorry /u/Mithryn, /u/4blockhead, /u/EmmaHS, /u/curious_mormon, /u/vh65, /u/AnotherClosetAtheist, and others).  Nobody is charging you a penny for anything.  There are no doctrines or dogmas... We don't claim to know the absolute truth, we just know where the truth isn't (Mormonism).  No forced attendance or participation.  No guilt for leaving or being less active.  If you're referring to people like Denver Snuffer or Rock Waterman who develop their own ideas about what the true church should be, I could see that being a little more plausible, but I don't see that happening to the people here who just got out of a cult.  Edit: Typo"
exmormon,3du0ev,Ua_Tsaug,-2,Sun Jul 19 14:18:58 2015 UTC,"There are no doctrines or dogmas... We don't claim to know the absolute truth,...   Oh yeah? Ever watch what happens when someone posts their opinion that porn is bad. All of the scientifics come out and slam him."
exmormon,3du0ev,DonttouchyourZelph,8,Sun Jul 19 15:58:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, first things first:  1) It still is not forced. Yes, there will be counter-arguments, but ultimately you can still maintain your opinion, since this subreddit unites those who have dissented from Mormonism and have various life experiences and opinions. It's not a mandatory creed like ""The Book of Mormon is true, Joseph Smith is a prophet, Jesus is our Savior"", and that hoo-ha that can't be challenged, questioned, or disbelieved. TSCC still maintains the idea that it's all true, regardless of facts or evidence.  2) As with my other point, /r/exmormon prefers facts, research, and data over personal opinion, anecdotes, and beliefs. I hate to make it sound like there's an arbitrary set of rules, but in general, if you post an opinion not supported by objective research, then it pretty much opens you up to criticism. A while back there was a nevermo trying to convince his tbm wife that she was in a cult, but he himself admitted to being a Young Earth Creationist, to which many members (myself included) called him out on this fallacious opinion of his. At the end of the day, it's still his opinion, but it's not one supported by evidence, and it won't be true no matter how much he wants it to be. I'm not going to argue the ""good vs bad"" about porn, because it's a long and exhausting argument, but my point is still this: at the end of the day, your opinions are yours to keep, but they shouldn't be immune to scrutiny or contradictory evidence, especially not here, where accuracy is highly valued. Personally, I don't mind being proven wrong (in fact I quite enjoy it), I am open to criticism and will readily admit when I have made an error, because I want to be as close to the truth as I can be. I think it's wonderful to keep an open mind to new ideas and facts, because you never know when you might learn something new if you let go of a pre-conceived notion that your opinion might be wrong."
exmormon,3du0ev,Ua_Tsaug,2,Sun Jul 19 16:10:08 2015 UTC,"About pornography or any kind of purported or self-described sexual addiction, I would refer someone to Daryl Ray, a psychologist and podcaster who specializes in the topic.   One key point he makes: there is no criteria for diagnosing people with sex addiction. It cannot be done. Sex addiction is not in the DSM-5 for this purpose. Sex is different in that it is a drive you are supposed to have and exercise. It is different from gambling or alcoholic consumption, because it is something that our bodies crave by nature for survivalist reasons. It is an instinct controlled by the same area of the brain as eating, drinking, sleeping, breathing and other fundamental instincts and drives.   People are free to believe and decide whether or not their own sexual behavior has taken an unhealthy deviation from what it should be. They are free to persuade others to their point of view, too, but they shouldn't expect the skeptics to take it lying down.   You can convince them if you have got the evidence and can make the case, but be prepared to have your intellectual ass whooped if you don't and can't.   We can't just call anything with a common set of rules or harsh standards for the measurement of ideas a cult. I have heard ""scientism"" described as a cult once, which is just ridiculous.   Are the rules and standards for discussing truth fair? Are minds amendable by facts, evidence and logic? Do they estrange outsiders and strangers in any extreme or unusual ways? Are they fighting to establish immutable presuppositions and prejudices against all criticism or seeking truth from whoever has it and can prove it? Do they deliberately subvert the minds of others or tell them to think for themselves? Do they shy away from hard questions or seek out peer review?   The answers to questions like these are what tell cult-members like tbms or Jaydubs from other more open-minded, less authority-driven people.   If you apply the word cult too liberally, it loses its savor and makes no headway thereafter. Ex: it's pretty culty to go around calling everybody a cult-member who won't subscribe to the cult of abject relativism.   Exmormonism is not even a 'movement,' much less a cult. It is a community that exists for those who leave Mormonism and need support. We are united on no other front whatsoever. We do not have an objective or a platform or a creed or a donation plate.   What we do have are a lot of disenchanted, and therefore highly skeptical, people, who love science and logic and will make you put up or shut up when you start making bold-faced statements about how they 'should' live, think or feel."

No offense, but a PHd and a professor at BYU doesn't constitute being a smart person. BYU is owned and operated by the LDS church, so technically, your dad is an employee of the LDS church. They have taught him how to think, act, teach, what to drink, and eat. All this, while very realistically threatening his livelihood, and unrealistically threatening his and how family's salvation.

exmormon,3dq6b7,exmo_therapy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:58:17 2015 UTC,"It's too easy to associate religion with stupidity and non-religion with intelligence. As much as the notion is popular among the non-religious, the problem is that this way of thinking is too simple.  There are a lot of reasons why a smart person might stay religious. Smart people might have been brought up religious and feel comfortable within the group. Maybe a smart person is only somewhat religious and has never had any reason to critically analyze their traditional belief. It can also be entirely likely that a person wants to continue to be religious because they don't value being no-religious as highly as we do. Beyond that, being intelligent is a highly complex thing, and just because people might be a brilliant in one aspect of their lives, it doesn't mean that they are good at any sort of self-critical analysis of their own beliefs.  Besides that, living a religious life invites a host of issues concerning justification of weird doctrines or some sort of cognitive dissonance. It takes an intelligent person to easily live with cognitive dissonance. It takes an intelligent person to somehow justify the fact that Joseph Smith married a 14 year old or that they can't actually put their hands on someone and heal them.  Be careful of falling into the ""us vs them"" trap of being surprised when a religious person is also smart. If that is how you view things then it is likely you are simplifying your life in the exact same way as OP's dad might be looking at things (ie, there is only the gospel or pop culture that might influence someone)."

In other words, it was his own damn fault rather than being ""God's will"". I see it an an excuse for lazy or sloppy play in a game changing moment.

We will put the sisters under covenant to obey the law of their husbands. Sisters, arise.   Each of you bring your right arm to the square.   You and each of you solemnly covenant and promise before God, angels, and these witnesses at this altar that you will each observe and keep the law of your husband and abide by his counsel in righteousness.  Each of you bow your head and say, ""Yes.""   That will do.   Brethren, arise.   Each of you bring your right arm to the square.

The effect, obviously, is to soften the rhetoric of female subordination. This could be construed as a step in the direction of gender equity.

exmormon,3drbub,tscc5415,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe whoever says that is thinking of this?   LDS Apostle Charles W. Penrose wrote:  In the divine economy, as in nature, the man “is the head of the woman,” and it is written that “he is the savior of the body.” But “the man is not without the woman” any more than the woman is without the man, in the Lord. Adam was first formed, then Eve. In the resurrection, they stand side by side and hold dominion together. Every man who overcomes all things and is thereby entitled to inherit all things, receives power to bring up his wife to join him in the possession and enjoyment thereof.  In the case of a man marrying a wife in the everlasting covenant who dies while he continues in the flesh and marries another by the same divine law, each wife will come forth in her order and enter with him into his glory. (Charles W. Penrose, “Mormon” Doctrine Plain and Simple, or Leaves from the Tree of Life, Salt Lake City, 1897, p. 66)  LDS Apostle Erastus Snow preached the following on Sunday, October 4, 1857:  Do the women, when they pray, remember their husbands? . . . Do you uphold your husband before God as your lord? “What!—my husband to be my lord?”  I ask, Can you get into the celestial kingdom without him? Have any of you been there? You will remember that you never got into the celestial kingdom [during the temple ceremony] without the aid of your husband. If you did, it was because your husband was away, and some one had to act proxy for him. No woman will get into the celestial kingdom, except her husband receives her, if she is worthy to have a husband; and if not, somebody will receive her as a servant. (Journal of Discourses, vol. 5, p. 291)  William Clayton, secretary to Joseph Smith, also discussed some of the temple work in his journals. In the Introduction to An Intimate Chronicle: The Journals of William Clayton we read:  Clayton described the temple endowment, a ritualized drama of the creation, fall, and redemption of Adam, during which its participants promise obedience and loyalty to the church, and repeat passwords and signs they believe will enable them to enter into the celestial or highest kingdom of heaven. He wrote about washings and anointings, preparatory rituals for the endowment ceremony, and described dramatic role-playing in which church members act out the Garden of Eden story of Adam, Eve, and the serpent.  As church members rehearsed this celestial drama, they wore special clothing and volunteered the necessary words and signs to enter the highest heaven, the Celestial Kingdom. Clayton recorded that “The tokens and covenants are . . . the key by which you approach God and be recognized.” In this ceremony, each husband escorted his wife through a veil, calling her by a “new temple name.” The woman’s salvation would depend upon her husband’s priesthood authority. Clayton reported Brigham Young saying that “the man must love his God and the woman must love her husband,” adding that “woman will never get back, unless she follows the man back.” (George D. Smith, ed., An Intimate Chronicle: The Journals of William Clayton, Introduction, Signature Books, pp. xxxvi-xxxvii; see also pp. 204-240.)   http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/resurrectwife.htm"

exmormon,3dp7h3,bassshred,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"Story time! I placed my son for adoption a few years ago and went on a search for a good home for him. I initially was speaking to a gay couple but once their lawyer got involved, it was almost impossible to continue the adoption. I looked for a couple who was closer, but since I live in Moridor, chances were they were going to be Mormon. So I looked for the most jack Mormon couple I could find. They're perfect. They are very much like my older sister and her husband (exmo and nevermo), very supportive of gay people and just all over loving and caring people. They're unable to have their own kids, so adoption was their only option (which is not always the case, I know.) Sure, they're active in the church but they're also not afraid to stand up for their personal beliefs, even the ones that go against the church's teachings.   Being Mormon may not be their best trait, but their good traits outweigh their religion and my son is so happy with his parents."
exmormon,3dqb3d,rogierogue,42,Sat Jul 18 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"I don't believe in God so I think priesthood authority (whether held by men or women) is pure BS.  However, as John Larsen says, while I would love to see the church burn to the ground, we must not forget that there are people in the building.  Leaving the church is often more difficult for women. Unlike men, they are systematically stripped of any identity outside of childrearing and home life, so that many Mormon women have nothing outside of the church. They are socially compelled to stay.  So, while I think the Ordain Women movement is asking for imaginary powers, the cause itself is about empowering women within a (sometimes) inescapable paradigm, and helping them to gain some of the authority and independence that would move them towards equality and hopefully out of the church.  As for Kate Kelly herself, I'm not a huge fan, but her advocacy has helped many Mormon women and so that kinda makes up for her failings, in my opinion."

The Ordain Women movement opened my eyes to the ""boys only club"" I always felt, but wasn't able to describe or articulate.

Whether or not you believe in priesthood's magical properties (I do not), it is the very real organizing power within the church. Excluding women from the priesthood excludes them from any real positions of power and leadership, it excludes a feminine perspective on doctrine, history, curriculum, even in how we perceive the divine. The priesthood structure creates an exclusively male lens for the entire religion, and women are just an afterthought.   I think that the mormon church is a blight upon the face of the earth, but as most of my family are still believers I am wholeheartedly for anything that would make it better, kinder, gentler, more Christ like, and less caustic, especially for all the women and girls that are trapped in the awfulness of what that religion is now."

exmormon,3dqb3d,BednarsHair,4,Sun Jul 19 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"I simply do not get the hatred heaped upon Kate Kelly and I have a hard time attributing it to anything other than misogyny.  You think the mission of OW is pointless because priesthood magic powers don't exist? Fair enough, I agree. But priesthood power STRUCTURES sure do. So isn't it worth supporting those who are working to improve the conditions within the church, even if all of us here ultimately think the church is rubbish? Don't those who remain in the church deserve a better church?  And the laptop thing. Good god, you'd have thought she murdered a baby monkey on live TV. No one was compelled to contribute. ""But she's a lawyer! She could afford it!"" How do you know? I have no idea what the finances of a recently relocated freshman human rights lawyer in Africa look like. Do you?  John Dehlin asks for donations all the time. He's supported pretty much solely by his podcast audience. No one bats an eye. And rightfully so: if you don't want to contribute, don't. So why are the rules different when it comes to Kelly?  Much of the criticism of Kelly seems misogynistic in nature. ""Bitch."" ""Horseface."" The OP called her a ""cunt"" elsewhere in this very thread. And yet the people making these misogynistic attacks are very quick to label themselves not misogynists. I'm not so sure."
exmormon,3dqb3d,thesamspo,3,Sun Jul 19 02:01:36 2015 UTC,"I've held off speculating on the motives of Kelly's critics here because the criticisms have been so shallow as to hardly warrant the effort.  That said, it seems painfully obvious what's really going on here."
exmormon,3dqb3d,darthV8R,2,Sun Jul 19 04:00:33 2015 UTC,Yep and if that's not indicative that people like her need to continue to fight for equality in whatever organisation they belong I don't know what is.

exmormon,3dqb3d,Ummcopythat,5,Sun Jul 19 03:01:35 2015 UTC,Does one's opinion about Kate Kelly represent some kind of exmo purity test to OP and other folks around here?  Kinda seems that way and it's infantile as far as I'm concerned.  Exmos here at r/exmormon ought to be able to cheer on public figures - or criticize them - without it turning into the kind of nonsense that reminds me too much of the old RfM (exmormon.org) board.

Everything else about the church she agrees with. At least that is what she projected to the public/media. I think she couldn't care less about the church and it's teachings. She wanted attention and she got it. Statements made by her formerly current & past ward members described her as a trouble maker, plain and simple. If she truly loved the church she would conform to its teachings. Including being ""modest"". Right after her excommunication, she was baring her shoulders. Just another show fire attention. I do not like her at all. I did however, enjoy the headache she was for the church."

The church is true and correct in their stance and she is wrong, or  B. The whole operation is BS from the outset, and wanting a bogus priesthood is a stupid waste of time. Either she can't see the obvious or she did it for the lols, but either way it was nothing but a waste of media time."
exmormon,3dqb3d,Chino_Blanco,0,Sat Jul 18 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, I back this 100%. I wonder how many people actually walked away from the church after that.

exmormon,3dqb3d,porlob,5,Sat Jul 18 15:40:38 2015 UTC,"For many, many, women, many who have posted as much on this sub, the OW movement was the catalyst that sparked their transition away from other church altogether in the same way as Prop 8 did for many others. I'm glad that Kate failed, because I want the church to fail -not reform. The solution is dissolution. Even if it was inadvertent, I'll give Kate a little credit for every exMo who was set on their path by OW, and count them as good fruit.    It's almost a thing to be lamented that there are likely not going to be many more catalysts to spike the numbers, at least for the foreseeable future."
exmormon,3dqb3d,icamom,2,Sat Jul 18 19:07:12 2015 UTC,Because Kelly isn't allowed to grow or change as an individual in response to things that happen in her life. Gotcha.
exmormon,3dqb3d,arkmabat,2,Sun Jul 19 02:08:44 2015 UTC,"I really like a lot of things that Kate Kelly has done. I am a big fan of civil disobedience and I'm glad that she tried to change the culture from the inside. I respect that sort of thing.  The fact that she petitioned people for money so that she could buy a very expensive laptop bothered me. I realize that she was only asking a small amount of trusted people for help and that somebody betrayed that by posting it all over social media. Nonetheless, her comments and style rubbed me wrong.  I still support her, but I'm not sure I like her."

This name is required at the veil to enter into the Celestial room, which strongly suggests it is required to enter into the Celestial Kingdom."
exmormon,3dpkb6,TapirOfZelph,19,Sat Jul 18 06:16:10 2015 UTC,"Was wondering what that meant. Thanks!  Also, my wife found the Temple Oracle while we were still members and found out my temple name based on when I went in before my mission. She was so upset that I knew her name and not vice versa. I was SOOO pissed at the time. Now, I think it's hilarious. That rebelliousness is what led us out."

exmormon,3dpkb6,Squeakystrings,3,Sat Jul 18 15:49:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I ended up telling my wife my name.

I thought it was stupid that my high school friends knew my secret name and my own wife ""wasn't allowed"".

So, come on out and join us--we'll steal a bagel, kick a few puppies, and join in loud laughter at the expense of the Lard's Anointed!!  If you're in Utah (depending on where) come on out on Sunday to our meetup. There's good food, coffee, and conversation.     On July 19th, my TBM/NOMish DW will be there in attendance.  If you have a TBM spouse or otherwise important person in your life and want them to come with you, but are unsure of what kind of experience they will have, have NO fear. TBM DW is willing to attend so they have someone they can talk to and so she can be a buffer if needed.     Our location...  Harmons Bangerter Crossing store:  Every Sunday, 10:00 am to Noon we meet upstairs in the café seating area. You can't miss us.  Harmons Bangerter Crossing  125 East 13800 South (immediately east of I-15) Draper, UT 84020  It's the best free 'therapy' you can get if seeing an actual therapist is maybe not an option right now.  Seriously, many of us that show up have bought the t-shirt and understand where you are coming from. Sometimes being able to meet with other ex-mos in person is a life-saver. Come on out and tell us your story."

Mind you, I know how uncomfortable it can be, but it certainly won't hurt you (my first meetup event during an extremely lonely and vulnerable time in my life, I almost turned back to my car to leave separate times.  I ended up attending -it was a concert, not exmo related- and it was a total drag. The people were boring and didn't welcome me with open arms.  BUT, it was beyond worthwhile..I survived, and learned to be a bit more discerning about WHICH meetup events I attended in the future). Go, and find out.  Having been to many exmo events in SLC, I can assure you that they're a pretty tame, kind and inviting lot...hell, they WERE Mormons, after all ;). Seriously,  go try it...'it' being anything...if you don't, you will remain right where you are.  Congrats on getting out of Provo...cannot even imagine what that's like!"

Hundreds of thousands have come to know the truth (I have received countless emails of their experiences) due to us all speaking out and directing them to sources of truth.  Recently I received a letter of apology from a TBM who contended with me a year ago and tried to ""save "" me. After looking at the issues, he now knows the church is not true and he had the integrity to contact me and apologise. Now he faces the issue with his wife.  I once bumped into a group of missionaries and had a discussion with them. Some time later, one of those missionaries wrote to me saying that, since that moment he could no longer bear testimony. After his mission he left the church.  So, yes, exmos rock! Let us be valiant in proclaiming the truth. Why, because the church leaders promote lies that are harmful to individuals, families and society.  Tom Phillips"

exmormon,3dp5qn,anointedone,9,Sun Jul 19 05:15:48 2015 UTC,Agreed. You just have to be careful about it. Ask genuine questions rather than just telling them information. Use emotion. Etc.
exmormon,3dp5qn,thesamspo,4,Sat Jul 18 02:53:01 2015 UTC,"yes always better to be the one asking questions, it allows them to come to their ""own"" conclusions.  Help them fill in the gaps, gently, slowly plant the seeds.  Undoing the TBM isn't a one blast deal after all the ""testimonies"" have been built in many cases over a lifetime.  I love the movie Inception, think of that in a way, you have to get deep inside their head, you can't attack them with the information because attacking only results in fight or flight."

What? No. Tell me what is it? No, you don't really wanna know... Tell me No...I don't think it will be good for you Yes. tell me Are you really sure you wanna know the truth?  Yes, please tell me   That way you give them the impression that they sought out the information rather than someone throwing it at them. It also makes them less prone to dismiss it directly because it is info that has value in their mind because they had to work for it to get it."

A few days ago u/YoungModern linked the endowment ceremony video. My husband asked to watch it so we watched it together. It cracked his shelf. I told him to read the essays. He wants us to read them together, which is fine by me. I need to reread them anyway. He got tired of me telling him that it wouldn't be good for him. It works!"

I learned I do not talk about it, unless the conversation is an open one, and NOT A FIGHT. This is what works for me.   My relationships are not worth sacrificing for the truth,  especially to people who are not ready to accept the facts. I feel alone enough as it is now.   If they are ready,  I'll share more with them.  Otherwise I will just be their sister, friend, daughter, and love them."
exmormon,3dp5qn,RoxySnow,2,Sat Jul 18 12:46:33 2015 UTC,"Consider the goal... a lot of information makes people defensive-- which makes them cling tighter to their faith; people like to feel like they discovered things on their own. Reverse psychology often works better: (e.g. ""Don't read the CES letter if you want to keep your faith!"")  Also, a lot of time, people come to need their faith. I just read the Elizabeth Smart story-- so much of what happened to her-- what her kidnapper did was based on the warped teachings of Joseph Smith... Kind of like a cross between Warren Jeffs and the stuff that went on in Under the Banner of Heaven... Mormonism is so implicated... and so implicated in how he was able to get her and Barzee to comply... and to take his success as ""signs"" that he really was doing as god directed...   But then she talks about how her Mormon faith helped her cope and helped her out after this ordeal and such...  and I see this over and over... a Mormon kid commits suicide because they are gay and Mormon... and then the family turns to their faith to cope...   A Mormon woman has more kids than she can handle BECAUSE of the church and turns to the church and church sources to help and then praises the church for helping her cope.   Older people have often invested so much-- younger people have much more to lose and it's probably better to plant seeds there.  I like places like this... or places on the internet where believers have an inkling as to what they might come across-- I don't like blind-siding people-- some people ""need"" their faith, and I think they have a right to it.   Places like this, I think people should be able to speak freely-- If TBMs are chased away or offended or whatever-- too bad, so sad... they have their churches and homes and so forth where they can exercise their freedom of speech. Nobody is making them come here."

If more people leaving created a wake behind them, then more people would become aware of the problems.  But here I am.  I didn't even post something on Facebook.  So who am I to talk.  However I have some suggestions that come from Ryan Cragun's book How to Defeat Religion in 10 easy steps.  Stop subsidizing religion and deregulate it.  Recently there have been some good suggestions about how to attack the tax exempt status for religions.  That might be an avenue to take where you can make some actual waves.  Support secular education and also education in Science and the Arts.  I will call it the PBS effect.  Trying to raise the level of discourse among the general society.  It cracks the foundation of religion."
exmormon,3dp5qn,CrepeMaker,2,Sat Jul 18 14:01:22 2015 UTC,"Mostly because you need social belonging and acceptance. You traded mormonism for exmormon status and now you follow a redefined group with and agenda to save the misguided mormons to a new paradigm. The exmormon group can be as intoxicating as mormonism or any other socially limiting faction and can become as dangerous. Look at the group of people following Denver Snuffer. This guy says he talks to Jesus. Holy shit, people should be running for the exits.  I am not saying that the exmo group is a cult in itself but people will use the disaffection to pull people into their reality, be careful you don't fall into fanatical need to bring the church down. You will end up being exactly like them if you are not aware of your commitment to the group and the fringe people that will exploit you while you are vulnerable.  Your comments on the OP have clear signs that you are trending toward an unhealthy outcome."

My memories of being a YW in the church involved marriage talk to the extreme.  I'm planing on discussing healthy relationship skills, communication, sexuality, and teaching them to clean up their crap.  Other than that, I had no plans to ""prepare them for marriage"" specifically, but rather prepare them for life and if marriage is something that happens great, if not that's cool too.  Is that too hands off of an approach?  I'm still trying to deprogram, so I'm not sure if I'm taking too laisse faire of an approach or not."

In those texts he says that the greatest joy is the love experienced between a man and a woman (I suppose he might say spouses in todays society)... and compare that to what Paul says in the Bible that influenced a certain church not to be named and many of its offshoots to demand celibacy of its most obedient...

There is calm and rest for your soul, and equal opportunities for your daughters. For many women the safer and more peaceful choice is to leave the church. Give yourself permission to make the best choice for you and your own well-being. Put your faith in yourself and in women.   OMG. This whole article rings SO true to me.

One of the first things I evaluated was a yellow, plastic scrubbing duck. Now every time I see the duck I think, you do bring me joy! Same thing with my closet. I see a whole row of blouses that make me smile. I'm not done with all the clothes. Books may be difficult.  Kondo also says that when you dispose of something, you thank it for the service it's done for you, and you wish it well on its new way. I've had a really easy time giving things away.   So, Kate Kelly is correct. If the Mormon church is not bringing you joy, let it go. Thank it for what it's given you, and dump it."

I get tired just thinking of all the work she did, and it is a mystery to me what she got out of it.  It's a shame the church doesn't treat women equally.

The reason I won't is because I'm not out to many of my extended family members, and with any luck, will never be.  Simply put, this article drips with privilege.  Kate doesn't mention her own struggles to remain faithful and how painful excommunication was for her.  She doesn't acknowledge that her husband and parents support and love her regardless of her church status.  I've known many folks who literally lost everything due to leaving the church (marriage, love and respect of children, employment) and many, many more who are for all intents and purposes being held captive every Sunday because the costs of leaving are too high.  For folks who are recent converts with no family members in the church, leaving is probably easy.  But for folks like me who have multiple generations of family members in the church, leaving isn't a decision that's made in a vacuum and can affect a lot more folks than just the person with doubts.

exmormon,3douge,benedictFocker,4,Sat Jul 18 03:36:00 2015 UTC,"I do like Kate Kelly:  By completely bypassing those, you know, critical faith questions like ""Heavenly Father's will through the spirit"" and just appealing to emotional and social aspects of thought, she's bypassing a big wall.  That's an important psychological tactic.  I like how she tried to stay in the church, then they forced her to leave and now she's like ""hey, you know, now that I have no choice it turns out leaving isn't so bad.""  Great approach at breaking down defenses.  I don't like Kate Kelly:  Her argument quintessentially proves the Mormon theological position that women shouldn't have spiritual authority.  Imagine that you have a food supply and get stranded in a cabin or something.  You have to ration the food, or people will starve.  Forget what you have to do, the food must be rationed or people will die.  Instead of talking about how much food should be rationed, how many days it will be needed for etc. you talk about whether eating more now might bring ""joy"" or how deferring food might affect how a person's understanding of what's expected of them and how they fit into the social environment.  Yes, avoiding the doctrinal questions, the faith question, you can appeal to some people and hit them where they're not expecting.  But the people who actually believe won't reconcile this.  If you won't leave mormonism because your salvation is a concern to you, and KK's argument is the one you hear to leave, then you'll understand that the feminist argument doesn't care about salvation, that it's short-sighted and emotional.  So, I think KK's tactic is interesting, but I also sort of feel that it ignores the questions that keep people in the church.  Like, salvation and souls and stuff.  Obviously, not everyone in the church thinks about or cares about that.  When Mormonism failed her she did that thing where we want something to replace it so we can still be emotionally devoted to something that gives us meaning and place.  I think using words like ""colonized our minds"" gives her away as a member of the ""cult"" of feminism rather than a feminist.  Because, what do TBM's care about fem jargon and neo-marxist social theory?  If KK had more self-awareness she might be able to express the same ideas more empathetically to the mormons she knows very well.  But, it's as if she's sort of trapped in her new cult.  It makes sense.  In neomarxist social theory, truth is not really a real thing and facts are more a product of our social environment.  So, it's appropriate to believe in mormonism if you're part of that culture because it's no more or less true than whatever a jewish hollywood director or atheist computer programmer would believe in their cultures.  And so you can not really believe in Mormonism but still believe in it because nothing's really true anyway and what matters is who you belong to.  So, she wanted to reform who she belonged to.  And she views remaining mormon as a legitimate choice because that social theory views cultural environment as supreme, and therefore hard to separate from self anyway.  That's sort of true in Mormonism, but that's because mormonism is kind of an extreme cult.  My issue with this is that Mormonism is not ""maybe true maybe not, equally true or not true as anything else"".  Mormonism's not true.  And mormon's are loyal to their culture and ""patriarchy"" because they believe it is true.  So, sidestepping that question, again, presents a compelling tactic and reaches areas of the mind and soul that are less defensive.  But I don't know if that's actually her tactic, or if she's just joined a new cult.  Which would make me sad, because her overall mission seems like a good one."

The biggest thing that has made me fall away or begin to fade is because I feel like I lied to those I absolutely love and adore from my mission. But of course I didn't know that I was lying, I truly believed EVERYTHING!   To get to the point of your question though, I began dating my sweetheart 7...or so months ago, and We've known each other for 4 years. At first when we started dating I told him I could prove that the church was true (I was told that and I believed it!) so as I began to question more and try to find answers, I started to find that I couldn't, and It was really devastating, my plan had been to convert him, ""to save his soul"" but really now I feel he has been saving mine.   The more I started to think for myself and get out of the brainwashing that I had gone through on my mission, I also was so miserable much of my mission, I found I was so much happier, I like to think things through. Then I just felt really strongly to move in with him and I feel liberated by making my own decisions.

I finally told them the day before my college graduation (because my SO told me he wouldn't feel comfortable attending if it meant he'd have to participate in my lie by omission). I was worried they wouldn't come to my graduation anymore, that they'd be too heartbroken. But they did come, and my SO did as well. They were still proud of what I'd accomplished and treated us to dinner afterward. My dad did pull my SO aside and apparently got quite emotional--he wanted him to know that though they don't approve of our living situation, they do like him as a person.   I wish something so trivial wouldn't have to become such a monumental issue, it makes me angry that the church causes people so much unnecessary pain.

A Big thing is listening to them, actually listening and responding accordingly. And I've built a lot of trust with my parents so that helps. The big thing is I was just honest and did well on praising my mother for who she is and that I am still the good girl she wants me to be. (whatever definition that is to her) I gave my mom a heads up alone and that really helped her for when my SO came over and we spoke to both my parents about it. She needs constant reassurance. The key for my mom is constant reassurance. My dad isn't really into the church, never has been and I'm an adult so he just says do what I feel is right. He doesn't approve fully of the living situation but he sees that we are totally committed and marriage is in the future. The biggest thing is honesty and being super calm about it when talking to them. Plus my parents both ABSOLUTELY adore my SO, that makes a huge difference on dealing with it."

As to the BofM comparison- if the BofM was never written, archaeologists would have found evidence that eventually led to the discovery of the Nephites and Lamanites.

Contradicting the standard narrative of church history is a delicate matter. People get disturbed and the questioner feels rebuffed. i rant into this problem at Claremont where the graduate students offended Church members with their expert knowledge on the New Testament when it ran against the standard views. I think two things have to be kept in mind. If your secret wish is to be an iconoclast, to break the images, church members will sniff that out. Or if you want to parade superior knowledge as some of the Claremont students did, you will meet resistance. If your wish is to help people understand our history better, you are more likely to be accepted. My second suggestion is be prepared. In a sense you have to begin each comment with the phrase ""there is reason to believe . . . "" If you challenge someone's long held opinion, they will want to know where you got that. What reason do you have to make such an assertiion. You can't simply tell them it is well known, or you found it on the internet, or that some critic came up with this information. You need to know where in the sources this new data can be found. If you are claiming JS looked in a hat to translate you had better know that Emma Smith said this in an interview with her son. That will not only add authority to what you are saying, but take the sting out of your claims. Then you can look at the document together and figure out what it means.

But it is there, and we need to explain why and how.""  Actually, it IS ""enough to say JS absorbed it from his environment."" ""Too complex,"" my eye. ""Beyond his cultural range,"" my ass. (It's certainly not beyond Rigdon's ""cultural range."") This is all just evasion. There's an easy way to ""explain why and how"": the BoM is a 19th-century text.

Who's to say what is a good way to live or not? I'm grateful for all that various 'anti's' have contributed throughout world history. Martin Luther was an anti-Catholic. George Washington was anti King George. The Allied powers in WW2 were anti-Axis. He's implying that anyone who is anti-Mormon cannot live a good life. This is completely false.   Should not Mormons have a connection with God that goes beyond the Church? Do we worship God or do we worship Mormonism?    In my experience, Mormons do not accept that members of the church can can have any connection to God that is incompatible with Mormonism. To me, this means that, yes Mr. Bushman, Mormons worship Mormonism first and God second. To test this theory, I invite everyone to tell their leader that through a personal connection with God, they have concluded that it is unnecessary to serve a mission, marry in the temple, pay tithing, accept a calling, etc, and see if the leader agrees that their personal connection with God is a valid source of inspiration in their life."

If someone asks me about Mormonism, I will criticize it and pick it apart.  However, I don't want picking apart Mormonism to be a driving force in my life."

The part about your family taking off time to show you Temple Square isn't quite the same because they've made a sacrifice for your benefit, but I'd say ""go anyway"". I never went to Temple Square as a TBM, but I still enjoyed going there as an exmo.

Your situation doesn't sound so bad, just be honest that you have no interest in church anymore. Your family has a lot of experience outside of the church so they are more likely to be understanding.  Most ""inactives"" eventually become inactive again if they ever start going to church again. Maybe try to find positive non-church things for your family to do together on Sunday to help jog their memory of the benefits of being church-free.  Most of all don't make a big scene about your disbelief.

And don't feel bad about changing your mind, especially this early in.  My girls decided they wanted to try a Christian church at about your age.  I didn't really want to but my husband was curious .... We went as a family for a few months.  My 9-year-old quit first; she just refused to go.  Then the 15-year-old decided she felt the youth group was too full of couples to feel comfortable.  At that point we liked it more than they did, me maybe the most.  And hey, sometimes I go back, especially for big holidays like Christmas and Easter.  But I don't blame my kids for changing their minds.  Everyone has their own religious journey - that became part of each person's.  And if anyone wants to go back, they could.  It's an individual choice, or should be."

You never know how others will react and that's hard and scary for all of us, but it's often a surprise, and sadly not always a good surprise I hate to say.  However, there won't be a better time than right now.  If you think it's hard to speak up when they're in investigation mode, wait until they're going to the temple or fully indoctrinated and constantly preaching about the greatness and truth of the church.  Perhaps rather than come right out and saying you don't believe anymore, you could test the waters and express that you're skeptical the church is what it claims to be and that you've read a lot of disturbing church info that sounds just as weird as other religions (I'm putting word into your mouth here, forgive me).

Why are 10% of people born left handed?     Scientist have no definitive explanation but it is assumed a genetic trait or evolutionary anomaly outcome.       Does that mean they are defective since we were all born in God's image and we would assume he would be right handed (Christ does sit at his right hand)? And it's only been a century since the idea that being left handed made you evil was prevalent.         Bottom line....some people are wired slightly different.

Interestingly, I read that LGBT kids actually have an increased risk of teen pregnancy in at least some cases: http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302553?journalCode=ajph  And we are all aware of people somewhere on the spectrum who have passed on their genes including, possibly, any genes that may be involved in sexual orientation."
exmormon,3doh0c,articulett,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:02:55 2015 UTC,"Natural selection depends upon it.   One theory I read about left handedness was that at some point in human history, right and left handedness was a 50/50 split in the population. For some reason, probably pure chance, the tools and weapons created by man to survive favored right handed people.   Maybe the first craftsmen were right handed. So as more tools were copied, they were copied for right handed people more than left. So the human body began to adapt because it saw the advantage of being right handed and passed on this message in the genetic material. As more right handed were born, more right handed tools made...etc Easier to survive when you adapt to the tools needed.       I sometimes wonder if same sex attraction is just a natural control that evolution put into the genetic structure of humans.    At some point, you want less people reproducing or you want to curtail genetic material from one line of DNA to allow for other lines to replicate. Who knows, all I can say that being gay is hardwired for me so something in my genetic make up said ""this one needs a dash of fabulous"" and the rest is history."

exmormon,3doh0c,Nephihahahaha,6,Sat Jul 18 01:48:20 2015 UTC,"This is the line of reasoning that caused me to rethink the Church's position on LGBT issues.   TBMs believe that it doesn't matter how awful a life of living the commandments is for anyone, gay or straight, because they're making a sacrifice for the greater outcome of receiving eternal life. Mormons believe that gay people would like eternal life more than embracing their sexuality and going to the Telestial Kingdom (or outer darkness). The problem is that eternal life is just a celestialized version of heterosexuality, so a gay person cannot reasonably be expected to want to obtain eternal life, especially when they have to sacrifice something that they actually do want.   Basically, Mormons think that gay people should give up the thing they want most (a satisfying relationship with someone they love) so that they can die and be cleansed of their homosexuality and thrown into am eternal sexual relationship with someone of the opposite sex.  The God of Mormonism punishes people who, by no fault of their own, have no interest in the only brand of salvation he's selling. He is unreasonable, and Mormons should be able to recognize this."

exmormon,3doh0c,after_all_we_can_do,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:39:01 2015 UTC,I'm confused. The tbms that i have talked to have used the bible to cite why homosexuality is a sin. How do i argue that god doesn't forbid homosexual behavior?
exmormon,3doh0c,SexyGod,5,Fri Jul 17 23:50:13 2015 UTC,"Here's the major arguments I'd use to deal with the Bible to a TBM:  1) Homosexuality was not understood in biblical times. It was seen as a vice like wearing fancy clothing (mixed fabrics) or gluttony--a sin of excess. And so, it was condemned using the same language as that of eating shellfish. TBMs should not cast stones when it comes to sins of excess (sugar, meat, etc.).  2) There was no gay marriage in biblical times; we are in completely new territory, in which we are charting new moral ground. In biblical times, men were legal persons and women were not. So men could own women (this was called marriage), but men cannot own other men and women cannot own other women. If it's biblical definition of marriage they want, then women should be treated as non-persons in the eyes of the law.  3) Paul said he wished nobody would marry. But if they couldn't control themselves sexually, that it would be better to marry than to burn. Being in a committed, legal marriage with a same-sex spouse appears to be in line with the spirit of this message, especially since we know more about sexual orientation now than they did then.   4) The Bible is plain wrong about homosexuality being ""unnatural,"" (Rom 1:26-27) and luckily for TBMs they believe that it was either mistranslated or many things were lost or distorted over time. So the Bible doesn't have to be the end-all final word on homosexuality for mormons.  5) And what about the Book of Mormon? How many mentions of gay marriage are contained in the Book of Mormon, a document that was (allegedly) ""written for our day"" by prophets who ""saw our day""? Zero. So if it's so important as to disintegrate the family and lead to the calamities foretold by ancient prophets, why isn't it mentioned once in the Book of Mormon?"
exmormon,3doh0c,ShemL,2,Sat Jul 18 03:05:15 2015 UTC,"In biblical times, men were legal persons and women were not. So men could own women (this was called marriage)   Except that doesn't seem the case in certain areas.  For example:  Genesis 16:2-3:   2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.  3 And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.   It seemed to me that Sari (Sarah) owned Hagar.  Not all slavery was a marriage."

exmormon,3doh0c,SexyGod,2,Sat Jul 18 10:18:37 2015 UTC,"Allow me to comment on using the example of Abraham's wife as you suggest to reveal a larger role for women and property ownership in Israelite society in some areas--I happen to agree that there's some variability of women's rights based on social status in biblical times, but first off I want to make sure we are clear about the example of Abraham in the historical context of the bible.  First, it's dubious that Abraham or his wife ever existed at all. The Bible's internal chronology places Abraham around 2000 BCE, but the stories in Genesis cannot be definitively related to the known history of that time, and the opinion of the overwhelming majority of modern biblical scholars is that the Pentateuch (the series of books of which includes Genesis) was shaped in the post-Exilic period. The story was written 1500 years after Abraham supposedly existed.  Not only has archaeology not proven a single event of the patriarchal traditions to be historical, it has not shown any of the traditions to be likely. (Suggest reading: ""The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham"" by Thomas L. Thompson)  In Van Seter's book, ""Abraham in History and Abraham in Tradition,"" Part I, Van Seters argues that there is no unambiguous evidence pointing to an origin for the stories in the 2nd millennium BC. ""Arguments based on reconstructing the patriarch's nomadic way of life, the personal names in Genesis, the social customs reflected in the stories, and correlation of the traditions of Genesis with the archaeological data of the Middle Bronze Age have all been found, in Part One above, to be quite defective in demonstrating an origin for the Abraham tradition in the second millennium B.C."".    Also devastating was his analysis of Genesis 14, where he pointed out that the political situation described in Genesis 14 - a Near East dominated by a coalition led by Elam and including Hatti, Assyria and Babylonia - is not confirmed by any monuments, king lists, or other historical and archaeological sources. Van Seters also pointed out that the ten kings mentioned in Genesis 14 cannot be found in any ancient documents outside the Bible.  Whether or not Abraham existed, the stories written about Abraham in Genesis are not historically true. For example, Abraham could not have walked to the land of the Philistines centuries before these sea people came ashore in the Levant. While this alone does not prove his non-existence, it points in that direction. Of course, archaeology can not be expected to prove or disprove the existence of a man like Abraham. But citing small details in the story of Abraham (""her servant"") is even more sketchy.  If the Patriarchs lived, then the Israelites should have sojourned in Egypt, but there is no evidence of this in the Egyptian records. If Moses did not live then it is unlikely that Abraham lived. For Moses to have lived, there would have to have been an Exodus from slavery in Egypt and a military conquest of the land of the Canaanites. Not only do almost all scholars say there was no biblical Exodus from Egypt and that there was no unified conquest of the Canaanites, they say that the Hebrew people were really Canaanites who left the region of the rich coastal cities to settle in the hitherto sparsely populated hinterland. There was no biblical Moses and there was no Hebrew Patriarch called Abraham.  So when we talk about the people of biblical times, we're talking about people who held these legends of Abraham and Moses, not necessarily the characters themselves. However, the depiction of these characters, fictional or not, is important and may say something about wider norms and values in Israelite society, so let's address Sarah.  In your particular example, it's important to remember that the (perhaps fictional) character of Sarah was an old woman when ""her"" servant was referenced. While older women gained in social standing as they became female elders, it's far more likely that Israelites reading this story would conclude the servants were managed by her as part of her household duties, or that this servant was assigned to assist her, but the servant still was technically owned by her husband.  Although women often had great influence over their husbands (especially royal women), only widows and elderly women appear to have been able to act on their own in Israelite society.   Young women still living with their parents and wives were under the legal control of their fathers and husbands, respectively. They could not own property, start a business, initiate a lawsuit, or arrange their own marriage (an exception is that women could inherit property if their entire family died and no male heirs remained, but this would vest to their husbands upon marriage).  There do seem to be instances where married women functioned more freely in the community (as in Prov 31), but the implication is always that this was done with the consent of their husbands.   Women's primary responsibility in the Bible's context as well as in the wider Near Eastern was to maintain the home, provide heirs for their husbands, and, when possible, assist with the economic assets of the household (including animals, servants, etc.). In Hammurabi's laws, a woman who neglected her household duties in preferring business pursuits could be divorced by her husband.   Older woman (like Abraham's wife) beyond childbearing years may have moved into a different social category, functioning as female elders (see Deborah in Judg 4-5). But women played a subordinate role to their fathers and husbands, and could not contract their own marriage, generally speaking, especially if they were living with their parents--in which case, a father would give them away in marriage (but a son would not be given away like a daughter)."

exmormon,3doh0c,kurinbo,5,Sat Jul 18 00:44:15 2015 UTC,"Christian blogger John Shore:    Here is that Big Difference between homosexuality and all those other activities generally understood to be “sinful”: There is no sin I can commit that, by virtue of my having committed it, renders me incapable of loving or being loved. I can commit murder. I can steal. I can rob. I can rape. I can drink myself to death. I can do any terrible thing at all, and no one would ever claim that intrinsic to the condition that gave rise to my doing that terrible thing is that I am, by nature, unqualified for giving or receiving love.  No one tells the chronic drinker, glutton, adulterer, gambler, or any other kind of sinner that having committed their sin—that being the way they are—means they must stop experiencing love.  Yet living without love is exactly what anti-gay Christians insist upon for gay people.  When you tell a gay person to “resist” being gay, what you are really telling them—what you really mean—is for them to be celibate. It’s okay for them to be gay; they just can’t live out their gayness.  What you mean is that you want them to condemn themselves to a life absolutely devoid of the kind of the romantic, long-term, emotionally and physically intimate love that all people, Christians included, understand not only as their birthright, but as just about the greatest part of being human.  Be alone, you’re demanding. Live alone. Don’t hold anyone’s hand. Don’t snuggle on your couch with anyone. Don’t cuddle up with anyone at night before you fall asleep. Don’t have anyone at your table to chat with over coffee in the morning.  Don’t have or raise children.  Don’t get married. Live your whole life without knowing that joy, that sharing, that fulfillment.  Be alone. Live alone. Die alone.  The “sinful temptation” that Christians are forever urging LGBT people to resist is love.  Now isn’t that funny, given that love is the one thing that Jesus was most clear about wanting his followers to extend to others? It’s just so funny it makes you want to laugh till you cry."

Argument: People may be pedophiles, but that doesn't mean they should act on it.   Same with gays.  Response: Why should gays not act on their attraction?  What makes homosexual attraction more like pedophilia (mental and emotional damage, impossible to obtain consent from a minor) than like heterosexual attraction (not different).

The last one, my holier than thou cousin chewed me out for practicing the organ in the chapel when not dressed in church clothes.  I was fully TBM and the ward organist at the time, always went to the church to practice in street clothes, and was never directed otherwise by any of my local leaders.  I explained all of this to her, and she got even more indignant, telling me I needed to go practice in the RS room.  Rather than cause a scene, I dropped it altogether and went back to the cultural hall (which was probably what she really wanted).  The funny thing was that her husband was sitting in the chapel watching me practice and rolled his eyes when she started lecturing."

So, I expect to see you clean shaven the next time I see you.'  I was the secretary in the Elders Quorum at the time.

Mormonism from the 1920s on was all about mainstreaming and becoming ultra-American and increasingly conservative— morally and politically. Beards were part of the uniform of those that were on Satan's team.

Fast forward now to a bunch of Pharisee-type bishops who are commissioned to be 'Judges-in-Israel' and trying to feel the spirit when they ask you how many times you abused yourself last week.

No giant scissors with the chant, ""Let's go Shopping!"" No malls, condos, cattle ranches, stock options. No real estate development company, no investment arm, no corporate structure. No ""For-Profit"" corporate divisions. Jesus told them all to go sell all they had and come follow me.   The Mormon church is a perversion of biblical Christianity. And while I'm not a deist per se, I am astounded that the Believers cannot see how perverted and corrupted the Mormon church has become.   This is part of the real damage the church does. Follow the Prophet is the hue and cry of the littlest primary children right now. They will never lead them astray."

Most members of the board of directors of a large corporation such as TSCC usually try to say things that are minimally plausible but not the old boys.

Here is how it works: In boolean logic, a true statement plus a false statement equals a true statement. (Even if half of it is false.)  So, the two parts: 1) the church isn't a large corporation=false 2) Apostles are not the board of directors=true  Therefore, in boolean logic, the statement is true. The church is a corporate sole, the property of only one man, presently TSM.  Another, more pathological, reading of the statement is that Bednar does not consider the corporation to be a ""large"" one. In this case, it depends on the definition of how large ""large"" is.

Besides, the apostles ARE the board of directors.  Sure, it's a corporate sole, but it has a board of directors.  And the 15 make up the board.

exmormon,3doy3q,goforth2,2,Sat Jul 18 02:36:32 2015 UTC,Your parents can't make you pay tithing.   I doubt the bishop would accept a payment that you told him was coerced.   I hope you are paying your taxes though and filing your tax returns.  And your parents are going to know about your money when you do your FAFSA form for college too.
exmormon,3doy3q,lemmingkiller,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:33:50 2015 UTC,You could decide to be honest and tell them you're not comfortable giving your money because you have questions about either church history or what the church does with the money. Or you could just act like you're trying to get a job by bring applications home and showing signs you've been searching daily.. (?)

exmormon,3doy3q,Teract,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:02:31 2015 UTC,"So while your situation may appear rough, and we all dislike giving money to the church; the honest thing to do here is either pay tithing or come clean and be prepared to move out. A decent apartment with a roommate shouldn't be too expensive, especially if you are willing to compromise. There's a lot of options out there, but they may not be as easy as lying or just sucking it up and paying tithing.   Keep in mind, whatever you pay in tithing is likely miniscule compared to what you'd pay in rent. I'm willing to bet you also get lots of free meals while living at home? That's money saved, living at home. Even after the cost of tithing.  Look, you are 18ish. When I was that age, I thought I'd magically earned the right to do as I pleased by virtue of surviving 18 years. Life tip: freedom is the ability to fuck up your life in whatever ways you choose. Responsibility and compromise, don't sound as sexy, but if they are managed well, you can open up all sorts of freedoms (yes,  referring to the ability to fuck up your life in ways you couldn't have when you were less successful. ) ""You're born, you take shit. You get out in the world, you take more shit. You climb a little higher, you take less shit. Till one day you're up in the rarefied atmosphere and you've forgotten what shit even looks like. Welcome to the layer cake son.""   Finally, a thought... Are you being abused? Verbally, physically, sexually?  Are you working 12 hour days in a mine, making minimum wage? Do you carry your bed around on your back?  Sometimes we stop looking at the world around us and can only see our own tiny world. Life is good. Try to remember that."

I don't remember exactly how I felt about the afterlife during that time, but now that I know there probably isn't one, and certainly isn't one like the LDS church teaches, I'm fine. Really.

The spirit (not capitalized in the 1830 BoM) first possesses Nephi and tries to force his body to kill Laban, but Nephi resists (shrinks away). Then the spirit sweet talks Nephi into convincing himself that it is justified, despite the COLDS decrying moral relativism.   Then Nephi breaks several Mosaic commandments with no word on any repentance process for murder, theft of clothes and sword, bearing false witness to Zoram by impersonating Laban, stealing the plates through that false witness, kidnapping Zoram, threatening to kill him, making him swear an oath, etc.  It is actually a horrific story."

You know, that sort of ""just judgment"" like the telestial kingdom, which all of us would kill ourselves to go to if we could see it.   But I digress. So since Laban had peaked at his wickedness, there wasn't much left for Laban do to, but to keep drinking his coffee and wanking it.

Last night was the time of creation for the coffee, even didst mine wife make it.  For the passing of one moon was the coffee chilled, and by a bowl of oatmeal was this divine beverage accompanied.  Upon retrospect was my joy made greater, for I didst realize that the temperature did not violate the Word of Wisdom, yea even that Word which I have rejected as being false and fucking stupid."

He finds them in apostasy since he's been gone 19 months. He throws a temper tantrum that they have gone on without him and don't want his religion so he busts the stone tablets up in their ass.

But then again, growing up in the church I didn't know about the testimony of the Prophet President Joseph F. Smith during the Reed Smoot Senate hearings. President Newsroom is just ,""doing that which has been done"" before in this world:   Senator Dubois.  Have you received any revelation from God, which has been submitted by you and the apostles to the body of the church in their semiannual conference, which revelation has been sustained by that conference through the upholding of their hands?  Mr. Smith.  Since when?  Senator Dubois.  Since you became president of the church.  Mr. Smith.  No, sir; none whatever.  Senator Dubois.  Individual members of the church can receive individual revelations, can they not?  Mr. Smith.  If I may be permitted, the word ""revelation"" is used very vaguely here all the time.  No man can get revelations at his will.  If a man is prayerful and earnest in his desire and lives a righteous life and he desires information and intelligence, he will inquire of the Lord, and the Lord will manifest to him through the presence and influence of his Spirit, his mind, and his will.  That would be a revelation to that individual. (See the last line of his testimony to see a direct contradiction!)  The Chairman.  What is the answer to the question?  Senator McComas.  Is not that an answer?  Senator Foraker.  I think it is an intelligent answer, and a very satisfactory one.  Senator McComas.  It seems to me it is full.  The Chairman.  I want to hear what the question was.  Mr. Reporter, will you please read it? (the question is read).  Mr. Smith.  I think I have answered that.  The Chairman.  Very well; if you think that is an answer.  Senator Dubois.  Have you received any individual revelations yourself, since you became president of the church under your own definition, even, of a revelation?  Mr. Smith.  I cannot say that I have.  Senator Dubois.  Can you say that you have not?  Mr. Smith.  No; I cannot say that I have not.  Senator Dubois.  Then you do not know whether you have received any such revelation as you have described, or whether you have not?  Mr. Smith.  Well, I can say this:  That if I live as I should in the line of my duties, I am susceptible, I think, of the impressions of the spirit of the Lord upon my mind at any time, just as any good Methodist or any other good church member might be.  And so far as that is concerned, I say yes; I have had impressions of the Spirit upon my mind very frequently, but they are not in the sense revelations. (A direct contradiction to his earlier testimony in this very line of questioning!)  The Chairman.  Senator, do you think it is important to pursue that farther?  Senator Dubois.  No.   Source Does anyone have a PDF of the hearing minutes?  So there you have it; neither the apostles nor the Prophets Presidents receive revelation, just impressions (thoughts).   Except for Joseph Smith Jr; he was totes a Prophet of God /s"
exmormon,3dm6f9,Unmormon1,5,Fri Jul 17 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"Then why the shit should we be asking for revelation? If God wants us to work it out for ourselves, why waste time begging him for answers?"

In my searches for that testimony, I stumbled upon this gem (posted) by /u/TheNaturalMan here in this subreddit nine months ago:   KING: You are the prophet, right?  HINCKLEY: Right.  KING: Does that mean that, according to the church canon, the Lord speaks through you?  HINCKLEY: I think he makes his will manifest, yes.  KING: So if you change things, that's done by an edict given to you.  HINCKLEY: Yes, sir.  KING: How do you receive it?  HINCKLEY: Well, various ways. It isn't necessarily a voice heard. Impressions come. The  building of this very building I think is an evidence of that.  There came an impression, a feeling, that we need to enlarge our facilities where we could hold our conferences. And it was a very bold measure. We had to tear down a big building here and put this building up at great cost.  But goodness sakes, what a wonderful thing it's proven to be. It is an answer to many, many needs. And I think it's the result of inspiration.  KING: And that came from something higher than you.  HINCKLEY: I think so.

Sure, the implication and expectation is that the Bros. are right most of the time but when push comes to shove they are obeyed because they were called (by their like-minded buddies) and the guy at the top has outlived the rest.   I've seen this 'through a glass darkly' excuse more and more lately and find it inconsistent with past claims and what's expected. The TBM membership doesn't really see it this way.

More than once, an investigator would admit they didn't understand a single damn thing when we read the BoM together. I heard the updated translation a few years ago was improved, but it didn't seem much different to me when I saw it.  I served before they changed the Korean translation of TSCC name.

Do you believe Chinese people are also cursed?""  2) bus driver who asked about the current location of the golden plates because he understood a different origin story of how the Americas were populated.

exmormon,3dnhbr,joe_sausage_smith,2,Fri Jul 17 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what you mean by ""still do.""  Are you talking about the kind of mission Mormon young people do right out of high school?  I don't think that was ever a thing in RLDS/CoC.  Young people sometimes will work or volunteer summers at visitor centers.  I have three kids, and one of them worked at the Visitor's Center in Nauvoo.   I have a niece who majored in church ministries at Graceland (CoC equivalent of BYU) and she is doing something like internships at youth camps and church offices.  But as far as I know there was never anything like Mormon Elder missionaries that was nearly universal.  I know it wasn't a big thing in my lifetime (back through the 1950s) and I don't remember any of the older generation talking about it.  CofC was extremely active doing service missions, especially medical services.  These are typically from a week to a month.  People in the medical profession that I knew typically did a mission every few years.  People who didn't go on missions would financially support the people going in the case of nurses and others of relatively low pay (in the US).  The physicians I knew usually paid their own way.  One highly paid ophthalmologist that I knew paid his way plus a couple of support people.  Middle aged and older members often go to provide non-medical support services like record-keeping and cooking.  The people that I know that have been on these describe them as true service missions.  Any missionary work is incidental, although the church definitely lets everyone know who is providing the free services.  In fact, one of the many reasons given for changing the name was to prevent confusion with the LDS church on missions.    As far as I know they still do proselytizing missions, but with regular  adult missionaries.  The Seventy and Apostles do most of this, but they will often be accompanied by priesthood from other quorums."
exmormon,3dnhbr,dudleydidwrong,2,Fri Jul 17 22:17:07 2015 UTC,"This answers my question, thanks.  Never knew much or anything for that matter about the CoC until very recently.  The differences between it and LDS, Inc. are truly amazing."
exmormon,3dnhbr,joe_sausage_smith,2,Fri Jul 17 22:21:55 2015 UTC,It is funny because superficially they have so much in common.  They have the same priesthood offices and terminology like quorums.  Both have temples.  They share a common history and often shared a similar anti-Mormon bigotry in the rest of society.  But the deeper you go the more they differ.
exmormon,3dnhbr,dudleydidwrong,3,Fri Jul 17 22:30:06 2015 UTC,I'm amazed at their efforts to just do the right thing/be on the right side of history and let the chips fall where they may.  A very refreshing thing to see of an institution.
exmormon,3dnhbr,joe_sausage_smith,3,Fri Jul 17 22:32:46 2015 UTC,"Even though I am no longer active, I have to give them a lot of credit.  The basic dignity of being human has always been a big thing with them.  It is even in their D&C.  They are not perfect, but they try.  Just to take one example, the first time I ever encountered homosexuals was at CoC (then RLDS) world conference.  I was a teenager at a time.  I noticed that there was a kind of party room on the basement level of the Auditorium.  My parents kept shooing me away from that area.  Of course that piqued my curiosity even more.  It led to some great awkwardness from the person who told me what it was because terms like ""gay"" and ""lesbian"" were not in common use.  After stammering around a bit they mumbled something about  ""boys who liked boys and girls who liked girls.""  So obviously the members of the church weren't all on-board, but the church organization actually had formed a support group for homosexual youth back in the 1970s.  In many ways that has been the way it is in the CoC since the 1970's.  Church leadership has typically been way out ahead of members, and has been dragging members to put aside many of the old things.  I remember at conferences there would routinely be motions to do things like declare the BoM to be true, and the First Presidency routinely ruled these types of motions out of order.   As the leadership drug along the members a lot of splinter groups formed.  At times it seemed to me that the church was trying to do a purge and was encouraging people who insisted on the old ways to leave.    To be honest, I can see the CoC becoming a basically humanist organization with a foundation in the teachings of Jesus.  Many of the dissenters claimed that the church was in fact moving too quickly toward that goal.  Ironically I became inactive because they were not moving toward that goal as fast as I was.   Maybe someday they will catch up to where I am."

exmormon,3dnhbr,brokebackmormon,2,Fri Jul 17 22:34:21 2015 UTC,"The only language I've read the BoM in other than English is Hmong. The translation is... awkward, but not bad. The language itself doesn't have a lot of archaic methods of speaking like English or Spanish does, so a lot of the text is very plain. A lot of problems is that it was filled with transliterations rather than translations (in an attempt to make it more true to the English version) that actually portrayed the idea better.  It does, on occasion use an archaic (or disputed) meaning for some words. An example would be ""records"", which shows up as ""cov pheej xwb txheej""-- which if you using as an actual word, Hmong people would probably think you're making shit up. The problem I think is that certain translators had different ideas about what words could be used better for religious words, and thus you get some kind of weird hybrid words. Also, Hmong is a single-syllable word language, so long names (looking at you Coriantumr) were funny when said out loud. I'm not doing a good job explaining it, you kind of just have to already know the language to grasp the overall weird flavor the Hmong BoM has. Don't get me wrong, some of the things translated sound very beautiful (esp considering the source material), but overall it feels forced, awkward, and rather plain."

So you have kids who know they are special due to just getting accepted.

I went to BYU Provo because I was one of those TBM  kids who took seminary seriously and thought the U was evil and liberal.  I thought pop music was mostly evil.  I didn't watch PG13 movies.  I brought the bubble with me and contributed my share to it.  Thankfully a decade later of putting up with these well-intended backwards clowns has taught me why zealotry is unhealthy and why I believe in a more moderate way to live.

If you wanna get into the Gita, I'd suggest purchasing the audiobook on iTunes for like $4 or something. Well worth it. Get the version narrated by Jacob needleman.  Keep in mind, when it talks about the Self, it is talking about the more real part of you that is also a part of and connected to everything else, or atman. They aren't talking about the selfish you.

This is from BYU-I accreditation evaluation last year: ""The institution publishes and adheres to a policy on Academic Freedom which commits the University to the free pursuit and dissemination of knowledge consistent with the school’s mission statement. Faculty are entrusted with “individual academic freedom” and encouraged to pursue truth according to appropriate methodologies in their field. However, in the Policy, the University reserves right to protect the University’s essential identity and mission as an LDS institution:  Faculty are free to discuss and analyze Church doctrine, but they may not engage in “expression” privately or publically that knowingly contradicts or opposes Church doctrine.  Though the distinction made here can raise a concern about the specific difference between “discuss/analyze” versus “express”, the commission has accepted the policy in its action last year.  The Committee was not informed of any incidents where this policy was tested, nor did any member of the Committee hear any complaints from faculty or administration."" http://www2.byui.edu/IR/accreditation.htm  I would love to see what they say, now that they are receiving complaints."

So, did you have any copies in Arabic that you burned?"

They're brainwashed, it's pure fiction by a conman, let it burn. However, if this was burning of someone else's religious texts, nope, don't endorse that, but the church is making bank off these missionaries, a hundred books is nothing."

Objectively, that's ""burning"" a million Books of Mormon. But it's not on the same ""level"" as actually burning a million physical copies of the book.  Even back in Germany, back in the day, the people participating in the book burnings didn't seriously think that they were obliterating the information contained in them. There were libraries in Britain, the USA, all over the world. The actual ideas contained within the books would live on, and the Nazis knew it. The act of burning the books was symbolic of a total and utter rejection - ""this is how little you mean to us, this is what you are"".  We're all ex-mormons in this sub. We all know how the BoM is a heap of ridiculous bullshit. But Mormonism is still a religion, an identity. Mormons are people, with real feelings and real motivations. If they want to believe, it's none of my business. And I certainly don't want to see an entire creed, an entire nation destroyed.  This is what burning the book represents. This is the attitude that it projects. And I reject it. I reject it just as I reject burning the Bible, the Koran, the God Delusion or even Mein Kampf.

exmormon,3dl5oo,ocexmoyouho,2,Fri Jul 17 14:10:26 2015 UTC,Why? I think that book burning in many cases represent a hate of information and knowledge. As if burning the books containing the knowledge/information will change reality. I'm not for burning any books (wouldn't even burn Hitlers Mein Kampf)
exmormon,3dl5oo,SethHeisenberg,6,Fri Jul 17 14:15:01 2015 UTC,"Because today you aren't actually risking the loss of information. Most books (apart from extreme cases of self publishing with an aversion to modern technology) have digital backups and copies. Most of the time the originals are digital. It may represent a hate of what the book stands for or the information in that particular book, but if burning books is supposed to represent a hate of information and knowledge at large it's a very ineffectual gesture.  Like hating the rain and punching a rain drop. We were raised pre-digitization, so we tend to hold the concept of a book in a disproportionately high regard compared to it's actual role of information possession (which has become marginalized). You could gather ever physical copy of the book of mormon and burn them today, and in a week there would be millions of them fresh off the presses. In this age, it's incredibly complicated to actually stop information and knowledge. After this age? books may become far more valuable again depending on political turmoil, collapse of infrastructure, or natural disasters etc... Edit: if Hitlers Mein Kampf had resulted in your developmental years being destroyed through oppression and brainwashing, upon freedom you might feel a sense of liberation in burning a symbol of the machine that oppressed you."

Sure Burning books because you hate the information contained in the Book of mormon (yes, it contains information in the same sense every other book of fiction does)?

exmormon,3dl5oo,kumokurin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:00:41 2015 UTC,"For me it just falls back to the whole punching a rain drop thing.  If burning the book is a symbolic gesture of liberation for someone, go right ahead. I don't care. But yeah, to each their own. edit: i just realized I do have a desecrated book of mormon. I was camping on the front face of timpanogos and came across the one of the ol' quad jobs, (bible, bom, d&C, pogp) tied with rope to an aspen tree... almost comically-so, like a witch tied to a stake.

exmormon,3dl5oo,der_ewige_godwin,2,Fri Jul 17 15:15:10 2015 UTC,There are lots of things that are only symbols yet can hurt / upset others and as a general rule I believe we should strive to live to avoid hurting / upseting others without good reasons.   I could for example have a shirt with a big swastika and a german flag on it and walk around. It doesn't actually physically hurt anyone (its just your shirt) yet it symbolizes that you are sympathizing with a set of ideas (nazi ideas) just as book burning symbolizes you sympathize with anti-knowledge ideas.  And sure if you actually have an anti-knowledge worldview go ahead and burn some books as a symbol for anti-information. To each their own.

Sounds like there's a lot the author didn't know (or didn't want to be talk about). Like why he was in jail to begin with. Or...   Faithful Saints supported Joseph and Hyrum as the events unfolded at Carthage   Funny, no mention (as another comment here brought up) of the faithful saints who smuggled in a gun, or who brought wine and cigars, which they then smoked and drank with him.   Many do not know that on the night of June 26, near midnight, several members of a mob stormed the jail. They made it to the landing on the second floor but did not attack. Joseph Smith and his friends stood by the door awaiting the mob's entrance. Heavy breathing was heard on both sides of the door. The mob hesitated, not confident in proceeding. Joseph Smith sensed their paralyzing stance. With a “Prophet’s voice” he called out to them from behind the door. “Come on ye assassins we are ready for you, and would as willingly die now as at daylight”   I don't think I'd say they ""stormed the jail"" if that's as far as as they got. How did anyone in the jail even know that those ""mob members"" were even planning on attacking anyone? Maybe they were bringing food and water and blankets, but then they felt like Joseph was being an asshole so they just said ""Fuck it, let him starve in the cold!"""

In the US they have to book economy, but can use their miles to upgrade to business class.  For trips overseas they can book business class tickets.   I think this is completely reasonable. I am an exec level for the company I work for and I honestly would not fly overseas in economy. It's not reasonable to ask me to fly 23 hours to Singapore, work 14 hour days (with dinners) then get back on a plane and fly 23 hours more in economy. I know when the apostles and GA's travel they are always busy and work their asses off.......plus they are all older than I am (significantly) so I think this policy is completely reasonable.   The church does allow them to keep their miles. Which is consistent with every company I have worked for."

If the church is about culture and identity for you rather than truth claims than when you discover problems with those truth claims then you can shake it off much more easily.
exmormon,3dmdcw,Dravin84,17,Fri Jul 17 14:44:04 2015 UTC,"There are some great comments in this thread.  My take is that you are either a member of the Church because of the culture and an attachment to the organization, or because of the doctrine.     For me, I bought into all the rules, but the Church culture was annoying and I thought church was really boring.  I thought missionary work was dreadful.  I hated conference weekend.   I stayed on the straight and narrow path because that was the path to God, not because I actually believed the path proved itself to be the best path. (I'll admit that some of the ""we are awesome happy and successful"" stuff made me feel good)  SO now that I've found so many flaws in LDS theology, doctrine, and history, my reason for being a member is basically gone.  I have a friend who was never really committed as a kid and he stopped going to church as an adult.  He got married and had kids and had some tough years.  He felt isolated and trapped by the world, so he decided to come back to church.   He was met with love and support and acceptance.  He had new friends, new responsibilities, and a new purpose in life.   The Church gave him what he needed.    He believes it's the true Church, sure, but that's not really why he is committed.  He believes he was lost, and now he's found.    At this point, he doesn't' care about history or theology.  He figures the church must be true because of the way it makes him feel."

In fact, I am fairly certain that I was more committed to, ""the gospel"" than most TBM's ever have been.  I diligently sought further knowledge, and felt guilt for not being missionary-minded enough.  Sometimes I want to point out to TBM's that they aren't that good at being faithful.  If the church is true, then it deserves total adherence, one should spend every free minute preaching to others and bringing them to Christ.  The believer ought to be making every effort to being totally committed to church leaders and following their every words, in dedicating themselves entirely to the cause.  But they don't.  And because they don't, they're never forced to ask themselves what so many exmo's have... is this really the one and only true church of God on the earth today?  And because they never have to ask themselves that sincerely, they're happy to sit in their arrogance, knowing they were super righteous in the premortal life, knowing they were specially chosen by God, knowing they have some privileged power and connection to deity, knowing that exmo's/apostates are sinful/lazy/offended, and knowing that the church is true.  But really, with the exception of some dipshit apologists, the average TBM is content to follow the prophet.  Your average TBM is just a puppet, wanting to know how high to jump when asked.  Your average TBM is the worst sort of soldiers that came out of Nuremberg.  Unable to think for themselves, unable to question, unable and/or unwilling to direct their own lives.  /Rant"

They know they can't keep trying to convince sheeple of them literally seeing and conversing with Jesus, without being held legally liable for fraud by insinuating that they do."
exmormon,3dkhjs,DysgrntVeteran,59,Fri Jul 17 00:51:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, okay, everybody slow down a bit. This phrase ""special witness of the name of Jesus Christ"" is directly out of canonized Mormon scripture, recorded in Kirtland, Ohio in 1835, and which Mormons believe God revealed directly to Joseph Smith. I refer you to D&C 107:23:   23 The twelve traveling councilors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world—thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.   So there doesn't seem much room for conspiracy theorizing. However, I agree that in the modern day, ""Special Witness[es] of [Jesus] Christ"" is the more common term, but ""Special Witness[es] of the name of [Jesus] Christ"" is practically as old as the church organization itself, and goes right back to canonized scripture.  See also the Bible Dictionary entry for ""Apostle"" on LDS.org:   Apostle  The word means “one sent forth.” It was the title Jesus gave (Luke 6:13) to the Twelve whom He chose and ordained (John 15:16) to be His closest disciples during His ministry on earth and whom He sent forth to represent Him after His Ascension into heaven. The calling of an Apostle is to be a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world, particularly of His divinity and of His bodily resurrection from the dead (Acts 1:22; D&C 107:23).   Okay, but that's on the web. It could be easily altered. So let's dig further into past uses by church leaders:  1880, John Taylor, ""The Priesthood, Its Organization, Etc."":   The twelve traveling counselors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world;...   (Quoting D&C directly here...)  1892, B. H. Roberts, ""Untitled"":   The twelve traveling counselors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world;...   (Verbatim the same line as the 1880 talk, again from D&C...)  (Etc. etc. So how about the modern apostles?)  1984, Dallin H. Oaks, ""What Do We Serve?"":   I will devote my whole heart, might, mind, and strength to the great trusts placed in me, especially to the responsibilities of a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world.   1986, M. Russell Ballard, ""The Kingdom Rolls Forth in South America"":   The calling of an Apostle is to be a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world, particularly of his divinity and of his bodily resurrection from the dead.   (He doesn't cite his source here, but notice that this is verbatim the same as the Bible Dictionary. So it seems likely the Bible Dictionary was the same in 1986 and in 2004 (see quote below), especially given that it is itself citing D&C. It's unlikely to be a recent change in the wording, and even if it were, they can simply point to the 1835 revelation.)  The citations continue:  2000, Joseph B. Wirthlin, ""Pure Testimony"":   As a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world, I promise you that if you seek the Lord, you will find Him.   2004, L. Tom Perry, ""What is a Quorum?"":   The Bible Dictionary states that Apostle “means ‘one sent forth.’ … The calling of an apostle is to be a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world, particularly of his divinity and of his bodily resurrection from the dead. … Twelve men with this high calling constitute an administrative council in the work of the ministry. … Today twelve men with this same divine calling and ordination constitute the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints” (“Apostle,” 612).   (Here Perry is quoting the Bible Dictionary entry verbatim, same as the 1986 talk, and same as the current entry on LDS.org.)  2011, Gospel Principles manual, pp.72-80, ""Chapter 14: Priesthood Organization"":   Seventy  Seventies are special witnesses of Jesus Christ to the world and assist in building up and regulating the Church under the direction of the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (see D&C 107:25, 34, 38, 93–97).  Apostle  An Apostle is a special witness of the name of Jesus Christ in all the world (see D&C 107:23). The Apostles administer the affairs of the Church throughout the world. Those who are ordained to the office of Apostle in the Melchizedek Priesthood are usually set apart as members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.   (Notice that they use both phrases in successive paragraphs of the same chapter. This is the 2011 edition of the manual, but the phrasing may be much older; I don't have any hard copies to compare.)  TL;DR This phrase goes back to canonized scripture: D&C 107:23. Perhaps the relative frequency of the use of ""special witnesses of the name of Jesus Christ"" vs ""special witnesses of Jesus Christ"" is changing. It's not clear if that's happening, or if it is actually significant in any way if it were to become the dominant phrase. I don't believe the mumbo jumbo either, but let's back up our mockery with research, eh?"

exmormon,3dkhjs,ShriekingChapstick,11,Fri Jul 17 13:57:56 2015 UTC,"Here's a direct explanation of the phrase from Bednar, in 2011:  | An Apostle is a missionary and a special witness of the name of Christ. The “name of Christ” refers to the totality of the Savior’s mission, death, and resurrection—His authority, His doctrine, and His unique qualifications as the Son of God to be our Redeemer and our Savior. As special witnesses of the name of Christ, we bear testimony of the reality, divinity, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, His infinite and eternal Atonement, and His gospel.  https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/volume-12-number-2-2011/special-witnesses-name-christ  P.S.

This (so-called) thought process caused me to think about the problems the church has had with polygamy, blacks, violence, historical representations, and I was just struck with what a poor job Mormon-God seems to be doing looking forward to the unintended consequences of the decisions of HIS church's leaders.

exmormon,3dkhjs,Esereth,11,Fri Jul 17 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"Because for years the Apostles were titled ""Special witnesses of Christ"", and while they wouldn't ever come out and say it, it was strongly suggested that what this meant is that they literally have seen Jesus Christ in the flesh. Whenever questioned about if they had really seen him or not the answer has always been that they would not disclose it if they had since it is much too personal/spiritual experience to share with the world, plus they would be mocked. So basically calling them ""special witnesses of the NAME of jesus Christ"" the church is backpedaling and trying to change the perception that the Apostles have seen god since that is just silly and historically an apostle not professing it to the world if he had seen god is just ridiculous since that is supposedly the job of an apostle."

If you don’t know much about the faith, you’re not alone. For as long as Mormons have been around, they’ve been dogged by questions about even their most basic doctrinal tenets and religious ceremonies. Do they really have secret handshakes? (Yes.) Do they practice polygamy? (No, only a fringe group of fundamentalist Mormons still do.) Do they really wear magical underwear? (It’s not magical, but the special white undergarments worn by Mormons in good standing serve as a daily reminder of their obligations under the covenant.) So in recent decades, Mormons have made a concerted effort to become more mainstream. On their website, they feature frequently asked questions ranging from topics such as the Heavenly Father to homosexuality. They’ve mounted sleek ad campaigns to bolster their believers. And where they once used flip charts to spread the good word, they now use iPads.   This is a great write-up!"

I'm not a parent so I don't have much insight. But when parenting a child, don't you essentially tell the child how to think, act and dress, etc. You don't use ""scare tactics"" per say, but you do use ""consequences"" and the child really has no say in the matter. If they comply that's great, but if not then they are sent to their room or whatever.  I guess what I'm wondering lately is: aren't we all brainwashing our children when they're young? We just don't consider it brainwashing because we think what we're teaching or telling them is true or correct?"

I prefer ""unethical influence,"" authoritarian, or totalitarian influence. It's not ethical in this era to encourage another person by any means to accept a particular worldview as the only valid way to think.   If we talk about unethical influence as ""brainwashing"" it becomes something to ridicule that we could never be capable of, but the reality is that it is very easy for any human to fall into a mode of pushing their ideas onto others forcefully and manipulatively.

It can serve as an alternative to church for those who have a believing spouse/other family member.  Ex-mos are used to making Sundays free from jobs/hobbies from the TBM lifestyle, so it often doesn't conflict with other obligations. Some of the bigger exmo groups do have activities other days, but the Sunday coffee meetups serve as an introduction to the group."

The scars will fade. We might even begin to forget.   But for our family members trapped in the church, the wound is being clawed and peeled back open on a regular basis. Scar tissue never even gets a chance to form because the church relentlessly digs something back up. It could be 20 years from now, and something the read in the Ensign that afternoon or heard in church last Sunday could mean that the wound is as bloody and raw for them as if it was yesterday.  Quite often, in order to resolve the cognitive dissonance, what kernel of and autonomous and individual self they had gets subsumed into the hivemind. They start parroting shockingly bigoted and regressive opinions as their own to the point where their former self disappears.  That is why the church is so hateful."

In Mormonism's upside down carnival-house mirror world of distortion and deceit, they weep bitterly at the prospect that their healthy, happy, well-adjusted, educated, career-ambitious adult children might be wed to their fiancees by a vicar at a local church.  If you mope about pleading to God for misery and misfortune to befall your happy, contented, modest, productive, ""prodigal"" children so that they can be driven back into your fear-mongering mystery cult, it's not mysterious why so many Mormon parents lash out and act so evilly towards their ""wayward"" children so as to appoint themselves God's agents to sabotage and conspire against their disobedient offspring."

They can't scare me with losing my kids in the after life - it is much, much more important to be with them in this life.

exmormon,3djovm,portiaofbelmont,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:03:09 2015 UTC,The ability to love unconditionally is taken away by the bigotry that exists in the organization. They don't follow the words of Christ (their god) to love your neighbor as yourself. We hate the church because it's rhetoric tears families apart that don't fit into the paradigm. I don't think their god ever said to love only the worthy members of society or the church. It's their pride that fails them. Their god said he died so that all men might be saved...when will they begin to believe their own doctrine?  The other problem with the church is that the doctrine is convoluted and can be manipulated to conform to each individual giving license to some to practice bigotry in a religious setting. We see these stories on this site daily. We hurt when we se others suffer and we know it's the church and old leaders filled with the bigotry of the past. The best thing you can do is learn from your experience and become a better person despite the environment you grew up in. Loving hugs from your neighbor.

My advice is to STOP thinking/ worrying about your grown mothers emotional ""issues"".  She is a grown adult and you are a young gay person growing up Mormon!  Who do you think has the harder emotional workload?   YOU are one of the lucky ones who made it out alive.  Focus on making YOUR life great.  One of the saddest things I have had to learn about growing up in this cult is that the culture is well versed if not founded on passive/agressive behavior and manipulation.  We don't know we do it, we certainly don't call it that.  I have had to re-train myself to be more direct and transparent.  I can't fall back on sarcasm as a common way of communication.  Please know, you have already carried a massive load keeping yourself alive in a toxic environment, your mother's story is her own.  Do you think she has really been taking motherly care.of your welfare?  If you offed yourself in desperation over being gay she would have been given a merit badge of sympathy by the church for it.  If she accepted you, she may be shunned.  Do you now see how FUCKED up the cult is?  You were in great danger man and you got away.  Be thankful and work on your future outside of the cult."

I sent it to two of my hardcore TBM member friends that have been sending me shit the last two years to try to prove the Book of Mormon is true. They came back to me basically saying, wow, I never knew all of this. Thanks for sharing. I have a lot to research, and I understand why you left the church (ok, I'm paraphrasing).   I'm considering sending it to my parents as well. I know it will cause some cognitive dissonance for them when they read 84 pages of factual evidence that the church is a bunch of made up bullshit, but I feel like that's better than them looking down on me, wondering why, where they went wrong as a parent, and suffering because of a lying bastard conman that created this hateful church.   Anyway, if you haven't read it yet, it's at www.cesletter.com. I like it because it's just straightforward facts that use LDS sources. Maybe if you can get them to read it they might understand.   And by the way, my wife and I changed our Facebook profile pictures to rainbow stripes when the decision was announced.

exmormon,3djovm,hebermagalhaes,6,Fri Jul 17 01:07:08 2015 UTC,"They're bullies that shame.  They give away guilt, so they can sell redemption.   And they are master blamers.  It's always someone else's fault.  But they don't even need that tactic.  Anything they can grab ahold of.    When I was growing up in Rexburg, my Mom was always looked down upon by most of the fellow relief society ladies, and in Rexburg where there's a 97% Mormon population (Back then it was), the church is your circle.  My mom is a wonderful woman, kind and compassionate, and just nice.  She's not two faced, and completely without malice.  Well, they bullied her, but she couldn't see it.  When multiple people you trust and depend on give little digs and put downs constantly over years, it takes it's toll.    So what did they have to bully her over?  My Dad was/is a blue collar working stiff.  He worked hard, and we always had a roof, clothes, and food.  Life really wasn't that bad, but that was it.  My mom went to a mental hospital for breakdowns a few times, and she never understood.  She just prayed, and tried harder to be a better mormon.  She prayed, and went to the temple, and prayed.   Then she prayed some more.  Her only friends were assigned to her, and stopped by once a month, plus a doctors wife who referred to her as a service project.    As a young adult, my family moved to Rigby, 12 miles south.  There, an interesting transformation occurred.  My Mom was respected.  Fancy that.  The local women in the ward actually respected my mom, and treated her as such.   She got callings as quoir director and then went into the relief society presidency.  Her new friends stopped by every once in a while just to chat.  Not because they were assigned, but because they genuinely enjoyed her company.     From then on, my Mom's entire outlook changed.  She became happy.  No more depression.  Her life went from sub par to excellent in two shakes.     Now, that's really not the LDS Church's fault, but the members and the culture which I guess really is the LDS Church's fault.  That good ol self righteous indignation some members show others built on a church that most certainly gives away guilt, and blames others.   The problem is that when you break someone's legs, and then tell them to be grateful they have crutches you can buy from them, the person still has broken legs."

Simply being very upfront with the fact that you are done with the church and think it is a crock of shit is enough for the church to work with to torture loving mothers to make them feel like failures and give them false hope that they can pray to make their wayward children see the error of their ways.  I received an email from my dad shortly after announcing my departure from ""the path"" wherein he raked me over the coals for what I was doing to my mother, how she was suffering because of my choices. I basically told him that I did feel bad that she was suffering, but that using that to manipulate me or coerce me to behave a certain way was way out of line. If they wanted any future relationship with me then this was not acceptable behavior. If they suffer, they suffer by their own choosing, but I will live my life as I choose. I am no longer a child."

Growing up sheltered like that was the worst thing that could've happened to me. When I left for college I chose the school that was the farthest away from my family and still in the same state. My reason? So I could run away from church. Every time my mom called me she would ask about church and lecture me about it. I was so sick of lying about it that I cut off all contact with my family my first semester.   The worse part about it was that I knew nothing about how people really are. I honestly believed people were good and everyone is trying to make the world a better place. HAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT A JOKE!!   I ended up in an abusive relationship with an older man that would rape me. I didn't even realize it was rape until I was out of that relationship which lasted 2 years. I didn't know anything about birth control of any kind and luckily I never got pregnant. I don't blame my parents for sheltering me from the real world, I blame the church. The church is why they raised me like that.   FUCK THE CHURCH.

Right wing politics also tends to bleed in as they've just taken a beating on gay marriage in the United States. Nevermind, they have skeletons of non-traditional marriage in their closet.

Joseph and Emma were Fanny Alger's Guardians. Was it appropriate or even legal for Joseph to marry his Ward?  Was bigamy legal?  Was polygamy legal? (It was never legal in any place that the LDS church practiced it. Not in the USA, not in Mexico before it became the Utah territory, and not in Mexico or Canada where Mormons chose to move to escape prosecution from the US government.)  Doesn't the Lord provide a way for us to keep all his commandments in righteousness? If not, why did Joseph Smith Jr and all future polygamists fail to obey the laws of the land as stated in the Articles of Faith, which is doctrine of the LDS church?  Does the Spirit ever lie or fail to tell the truth? Then why was the Spirit wrong when it told Nephi in 1 Nephi 4:12-13:   12 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;  13 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.   Since the Lehites did dwindle and perish in unbelief, this is not the truth. If the Spirit can be wrong, I cannot trust it, and Moroni's Challenge is bullshit (false, if you want to tone it down).  Why doesn't Nephi ever repent of his sins in the Book of Mormon? I was always taught that the LDS church decries moral relativism, yet Nephi murders an incapacitated man, steals his clothes and sword, impersonates Laban (bears false witness) to Zoram, steals the plates, kidnaps Zoram and threatens his life unless he swears an oath to them, etc. All with no mention of repentance.  Who commanded Nephi to kill Laban? If they say God, tell them they had better read it again, since no one commands Nephi to kill Laban, but the Spirit does possess (constrains Nephi) and tries to force Nephi's body to kill Laban. Then the Spirit gets Nephi to rationalize killing Laban. Also, the word spirit was in lowercase in the 1830 BoM, so what kind of a spirit was it that possessed Nephi and tried to force him to kill Laban, then sweet talks him into rationalize breaking God's Mosaic commandments?  Where did the BoM people live and why can't we find any evidence of them?"

exmormon,3dn9jx,jdovew,5,Fri Jul 17 17:33:02 2015 UTC,"Recently, I was watching Orange is The New Black. In the show, the main character creates a profitable business of selling used panties worn by the female prisoners. Now, one of the reasons this was so profitable on the show was because it's a niche fetish. After seeing this episode, I was struck with an immense amount of regret that I left the church before I had the opportunity to wear garments, to then sell to creepy dudes on the internet that have a virgin/religious/mormon-chick fetish. I know they're out there, back in my TBM days guys were all about wanting to corrupt me. Y'know, there's a market for everything!   (Totally joking. And by ""totally"" I mean, like, 46%. I really do think there is a market for it.)"

I remembered the old gal at the temple said I had to cut off the symbols and then I could either throw them away or use them as rags.  Sure as hell don't want those as rag reminders.  Here are my thoughts....   If they do not hold any spiritual/emotional meaning for you throw the whole bag in the trash bin. They will be buried under tons of trash never to be seen again. Odds are good they will end up being shredded/dispersed  by some landfill equipment when that truck load is being added to the others.  BURN THEM: If you are retaining some kind of guilt or ? Idk what you are feeling burn them in a metal bin outside.  Consider that some kind of purification by fire if you will. You will leave no trace, won't have to cut out the Masonic symbols and you can be assured that no one will ever see a shred of them.   Burning them is a good way to say goodbye and start your journey fresh."

Add in the fact that they have made a lifelong commitment to missionaryesque rules of conduct means their sunk costs are a lot greater than your average TBM. Not to mention their livelihood is also dependent on the Church and that there isn't a big market for professional mormon doctrine teachers outside the Church. These guys are pretty much stuck. The Church not being true isn't really an option they can entertain.  I feel awful for them.

So in late November he had in his home office a couple cases of cigarette cartons.    Well this friend and I, (I think we were maybe 8 or 9) stole one of the cartons and headed for the hills where we intended to determine what all the fuss was about because of smoking.   We were safely away, and totally out of sight when we started lighting up our cigs and puffing away pretending to be sophisticated.    I got so fucking sick, I thought I was going to totally puke myself to death.  Smoking since then just hasn't had any appeal.  I even tried again later at about 22, to enjoy a pipe, with some very sweet and mellow pipe tobacco, but it didn't work.  I couldn't keep the pipe lit, and it just wasn't enjoyable for me....too many memories of the cigarette fiasco.    So I'm sorry...I am doomed to leave this world as a non-smoker, of all kinds."

It's so tough to quit, as a smoker for 28 years (now quit) I can attest.  I would however recommend at least trying alcohol and marijuana, if for nothing else just so you know what all the hype is about.  There are methods of using marijuana that don't involve burning and then inhaling smoke.  Just a thought.  I've tried almost everything, just to see what it's like, I've only stuck with tobacco (because it's so fucking addictive) alcohol (which I use in extreme moderation now, but nothing beats a good hoppy beer with a steak) and marijuana (because... stoner!)"

Which also makes it very clear that JS had no problem using an 'ancient' word when no modern word would apply. Which means JS would not have used the word horse in the BoM to describe something that wasn't a horse. He would have called it by its modern name (ex. Tapir) or by the name the Nephites called it in reformed Egyptian. That's like two smoking guns. TBMs could still shelf it though."
exmormon,3djzfu,tksmoothie,2,Thu Jul 16 22:49:28 2015 UTC,"Right, it confirms that the JST is truly revelation (in Joseph's mind) and not simply Joseph's musings.

Funny, the things you can learn about the bible if you just happen to be reading a bible with academic commentary.  When I first found out about the Dead Sea Scrolls, my first thought was ""Wow, we can compare their version the scriptures to the JST, and when they're the same (or at least closer, with some of the lost truths), we'll have proof that Joseph Smith is a prophet! Think of all the people we could convert!""  And then when I found out that it didn't match, and that even comparing the New Testament to some of the older texts we have of those, there are a fair number of additions that still appeared in the JST, I rationalized ""Oh, well he didn't finish it, and besides, he was working through it as he studied the bible, clarifying and fixing things to reflect the author's original intent, which can't necessarily be exactly replicated in English--and so maybe he just hadn't gotten to those parts yet."""

Petersen was attempting to show how the B. of M. helped correct errors in the Bible, but he picked a very poor example because it is the B. of M. that has been changed! Neither the Hebrew text of Is. 48:1 nor the original B. of M. support the present reading of I Nephi 20:1. Even as late as the 1888 edition of the B. of M., that phrase was not in the text.

Most. Yet, in the U.S., about 67% of the population is overweight and some 30% is obese.  Did Laman and Lemuel KNOW angels existed? Did they KNOW first-hand the power of God and the calling of Nephi? Yes! Despite the evidence, they still disobeyed.  Do people KNOW driving drunk, smoking cigarettes and listening to Justin Beiber is stupid as hell? Yes! But they do it anyway.  How many people KNOW cheating on a spouse or SO will hurt that person and their family? Many. But affairs that destroy (or nearly destroy) families and lives happen frequently.  The point is obvious, even with knowledge and evidence, proving commitment is still extremely difficult. Why do people of faith think knowledge = easy obedience?"

Basically, from 35 or so to 67 everyone is too busy to group up unless its parents/kid stuff and even then it is to support the kids, not the adults. One option is to find another church (like UU) that won't be dogmatic but provide support.

As a missionary, for the true church of Jesus Christ (not JS Jr), I was a literal messenger from God. I put all of my faith and belief in that, but never knew. I knocked on a door in Argentina one evening, and the homeowner pulled out a pistol and pointed it at my head. I was a greenie, in my first area, fresh from the MTC. I felt indignant fury at the man. I stood my ground, and rebuked him. I told him I was an emissary from God, representing God, no different from an angel. I told him that I would stand against him at the judgement day if he did any harm to me. My companion, a Uruguayan dude in his last areas, pulled me away from the guy by my backpack, and made me walk away.   I had a companion who was mugged with his companion when he was green. This guy was a native Argentine and was 27. He had been a sergeant in the Argentine  army before going on a mission. He and his ""Papi"" were mugged at gunpoint for their bikes, by a gang of teenagers. After taking everything, the kid with the gun showed my comp that there was one bullet in the revolver. He spun it, held it against the trainer's head, and pulled the trigger. Just a click. He spun it again, held it to the kid's head again, and the rest of the gang stopped him and yelled that they should go, so they took off.   I was later sent to the area where that mugging occurred. I heard gunshots at night regularly. I had people run past me with pistols in their hand. I picked bullet casings off the ground and took them home as mementos. When I was transferred to that area, the taxi driver stopped several blocks before the neighborhood I was assigned to, and made me get out. He told me cops didn't even go further in. I had to walk about 10 blocks with all of my luggage, to my apt.   While in that area, the other set of elders was jumped, and one got pummeled pretty good in the face. Had a black eye at church.   I knew guys that went to the hospital for stitches from having bricks thrown at them.

exmormon,3dko95,fisticuffs32,2,Fri Jul 17 06:55:36 2015 UTC,"I also got mugged in Argentina.   Were you in Bs As?  Here's my story from another thread:  My companion and I were both placed in a new area at the same time. I was about halfway through my mission at the time and felt like I had a good feel for Argentina and the language. The area had a reputation of being a little rough so we tried to stay away from the sketchy villas, one day we saw the police on dirt bikes and armed to teeth tell us to stay out of that area. One afternoon we happened to find ourselves in a rougher neighborhood as the sun was starting to set, we decided to try and get out of there. There was a set of abandoned train tracks that led directly out of the neighborhood so we started walking down them, we passed a group of teens that asked us for money (this was an everyday occurrence). As we got further the tracks were dug down into the ground so there was an embankment about 10 feet high on each side, as we got about halfway through the embanked part I noticed we were being followed by the teens. We quickened our pace but they started running, I had an ominous feeling and the thought occurred to me that maybe I should start throwing rocks or something.  They caught up to us before we could exit the embankment. One of them reached inside his waistband for something and told us to hand over our bags and wallets. I started to unbuckle mine but before I could hand it over my companion pulled a switchblade knife out of his sock and started spewing some garbled Spanglish that we were CIA.  The teens turned and ran away and I stood there in shock wondering what just happened. For one, I had no idea my companion even had a knife. We could have very easily both died that day, why would you risk your life over losing a couple BOMs, a crappy camera and $20? I was ready to hand over everything. We went directly home after that and I spent the entire time telling him how big of an idiot he was. I called the mission president to tell him what had happened and he laid into my companion as well. Needless to say I spent the next few days in paranoia and constantly looking over my shoulder in fear that the kids would be looking for retribution. Two ""Yankees"" aren't all that tough to spot in northern Argentina. Within a few days we were both emergency transferred to another area and replaced with sister missionaries.  I never told my parents about the incident until I was home from my mission and when I did my parents were very upset that I kept it from them."
exmormon,3dko95,vampirepiggyhunter,5,Fri Jul 17 13:54:04 2015 UTC,They replaced you with sisters!!! Really?!?! After THAT happened they thought it would be a good idea to put sisters in the same situations?!?! WTF?!?!
exmormon,3dko95,The_Last_Y,3,Fri Jul 17 18:05:55 2015 UTC,When I got to Argentina they had just instituted a rule for all missionaries that they weren't allowed to have backpacks anymore. Everyone had to have a bag that had only one loop because a missionary was shot because he couldn't get the backpack off both shoulders quick enough. I was pretty lucky during my time. I walked into a couple stores being robbed and stumbled across the bloody aftermaths of muggings but never went through any of it myself.

He thought about making Costa Rica his semi-permanent home as he continued his mission, which included waking up early to read scripture, sharing the gospel with new people he met, performing volunteer work in the afternoons, and making an effort to share the gospel again in the evening before bedtime.   Either this journalist did a really shitty job writing this story or this is made up."

My shins wouldn't even burn, they were just eternally white. But since I was a guy it wasn't a huge deal.  But now, as a dude in my 30s, I recognize the beauty of skin just being its natural color. Pale skin is beautiful. Naturally tan skin is beautiful. Dark skin is beautiful.

exmormon,3dkxcs,Unmormon1,3,Fri Jul 17 04:16:14 2015 UTC,"Here is my collection of evidence that Joseph Smith taught they were on a separate planet:   Beck, James - 1861 Young, Brigham - 1867  Allen, Daniel -1872 Pratt, Orson - 1875 Gates, Jacob - 1881 Dibble, Philo - 1882/4,1906 Hamblin, Jacob - ? Rogers, Samuel - After 1840? Snow, Eliza R. - 1881, 1931 Snow, Joseph - 1889 Mace, Wandle - Before 1890 Cannon, George Q. - 1891 Smith, Bathsheba - 1892 Richards, Franklin W. - 1892 Brown, Benjamin - 1924 Call, Anson - 1924 Van Cott, John - 1931   A portion of the North country containing the Ten Tribes may be separated from the Earth. (Wilford Woodruff Journal, September 25th, 1859.)  Joseph Smith said that the 2 Prophets who would Prophesy in the streets of Jerusalem for 3 years & a half, were Enoch & Elijh. Also the two wings north & South of our earth were inhabited. the north with the 9-1/2 tribes & the south wing by the People of Enochs City - this Earth when first created occupied a Position next to Kolob the highest in glory of all the Creations consequently on account of the high Position we once occupied we have fallen below all of the others in space--consequently our sufferings are greater--the greater the rise the greater will be the fall-when we are Redeemed we will be taken back again & Placed in our former Position. (James Beck Journal, October 8th 1861.)  President Young said he had heard Joseph say that the Ten Tribes of Israel were on a portion of land seperated from this Earth. (Wilford Woodruff Journal, September 8th, 1867.)  I heard the Joseph the Prophet say that he had seen John the revelator and had a long conversation with him, whom told him that he John was their leader, prophet, priest, and king, and said that he was preparing that people to return and further said there is a mighty host of us. And Joseph further said that men might hunt for them but they could not find them for they were upon a portion of this planet that had been broken off and which was taken away. And the sea rushed in between Europe and America, and that when that piece returns there would be a great shake; the sea would then move to the north where it belonged in the morning of creation. (Daniel Allen, Minutes of the Parowan School of the Prophets, 17 August 1872 )  The Prophet Joseph once in my hearing advanced his opinion that the Ten Tribes were separated from the Earth; or a portion of the Earth was by miracle broken off, and that in the latter-days it would be restored to Earth or be let down in the polar regions. Whether the Prophet founded his opinion upon revelation or whether it was a matter of mere speculation with him, I am unable to say. (Orson Pratt to John C. Hall, December 13th, 1875.)  11 Feb 1881 - Some remarks were made by Sister Green stating that she heard Eliza Snow speak of the 9 and ½ lost tribes being on an orb and would eventually come back to their former place and we should know when they came by certain signs.  6 Mar 1881 - Brother Jacob Gates ... Said he heard Joseph Smith say when he was at Bishop Partridge's house in Far West, Missouri, concerning the ten lost tribes. “They are hid from us by land and air.” Said Bishop Partridge, “I guess they are by land and water,” in a doubting manner as if Joseph did not know what he was talking about. “Yes,” said Joseph, “by land and air; they are hid from us in such a manner and at such an angle that the astronomers cannot get their telescopes to bear on them from this Earth.”  10 Mar 1881 - At night paid Sister Eliza R. Snow a short visit and had some conversation with her on the dividing of the Earth. She told me that she heard the Prophet say that when the Ten Tribes were taken away the Lord cut the Earth in two, Joseph striking his left hand in the centre with the edge of his right to illustrate the idea, and that they were on an orb or planet by themselves, and when they return with the portion of this Earth that was taken away with them, the coming together of these two bodies or orbs would cause a shock and make the 'Earth reel to and fro like a drunken man.' She also stated that he said the Earth was now ninety times [percent?] smaller now than when first created or organized.  17 April 1898 - Attended Sunday school theological class. Brother Joseph Snow gave a very interesting lecture on the scattering and gathering of Israel. Said that the papyrus obtained by the Prophet Joseph Smith in connection with the Books of Moses and Abraham fond in the wrappings of the mummies gave an account of the ten lost tribes of Israel, their journeyings geographically to the land of the North country, a place where no man had ever set his foot before, also a diagram showing their present location (in space), also the city of Enoch. (Diary of Charles L. Walker.)  In the afternoon I go uptown and meet Lorin Woolley, with whom I converse for 2 or 3 hours. He told me of some of his experiences in the underground business, and confirmed some points of doctrine I had believed in. He agreed with me that the ten tribes are not on the earth, and moreover said that in reading George Q. Cannon's Doctrine and Covenants, he had noted in the margin a statement to that effect, which had been made by the Prophet Joseph Smith.     George E. Woolley (his uncle) Journal, September 22, 1891.   He [Franklin W. Richards] said that the ten tribes of Israel were separated from the earth - so Joseph Smith had said. (Rudger Clawson Diary, Book 10, p. 87, referring to Richards, 3 Apr 1892 conference talk)   I heard him say, “Peradventure, the Ten Tribes were not on this globe, but a portion of earth had cleaved off with them and went flying into space, and when the time comes when the 'earth reels to and fro like a drunken man and the stars from heaven fall,' it would join on again.” (Bathsheba W. Smith, Recollections of the Prophet Joseph Smith, The Juvenile Instructor 27:34, 1st June 1892.)  Philo Dibble testified in May, 1884 that in 1882 in response to his asking the Prophet of the location of the Ten Tribes he was drawn a diagram showing the Earth with two spheres on either of its sides, one of which was supposed to be their residence. (His son Sidney and Matthew M. Dalton made sworn statements to this effect in January 1906.)"
exmormon,3dkxcs,lucifirous,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:43 2015 UTC,"Part Two -  Brother Brown, will you give us some light and explanation of the 5th verse on page 386 of the Hymn Book which formed another planet, according to the Hymn of Eliza R. Snow?   “Yes, sir, I think I can answer your question. Sister Eliza R. Snow, in visiting my grandparents, was asked by my grandmother: 'Eliza, where did you get your ideas about the Ten Lost Tribes being taken away as you explain it in your wonderfull Hymn?' She answered as follows: 'Why, my husband (The Prophet Joseph) told me about it.'   Have you any other information that your grandfather ever gave you, as contained in any conversation with the Prophet Joseph Smith?   I have! One evening in Nauvoo, just after dark, somebody rapped at the door very vigorously. Grandfather said he was reading the Doctrine and Covenants. He rose hurriedly and answered the summons at the door, where he met the Prophet Joseph Smith.   He said, 'Brother Brown, can you keep me over night, the mobs are after me?' Grandfather answered, 'Yes, sir. It will not be the first time, come in.'   'All right,' the Prophet said, shutting the door quickly. He came in and sat down. Grandmother said: 'Brother Joseph, have you had your supper?'   'No' he answered, 'I have not.' So she prepared him a meal and he ate it. Afterward thy were in conversation relative to the principles of the Gospel. During the conversation the Ten Lost Tribes were mentioned. Grandfather said, 'Joseph, where are the Ten Tribes?' He said 'Come to the door and I will show you, come on Sister Brown, I want you both to see.'   It being a starlight night the Prophet said 'Brother Brown,can you show me the Polar Star?' 'Yes, Sir,' he said, pointing to the North Star. 'There it is.' 'Yes, I know' said the Prophet, 'But which one? There are a lot of stars there.'   Grandfather said: 'Can you see the points of the Dipper?' The Prophet answered, 'Yes.' 'Well' he said, 'trace the pointers,' pointing up to the largest star. 'That is the North Star.'   The Prophet answered: 'You are correct. Now,' he said, pointing toward the star, 'do you discern a little twinkler to the right and below the Polar Star, which we would judge to be about the distance of twenty feet from here?'   Grandfather answered, 'Yes, sir.'   The Prophet said: 'Sister Brown, do you see that star also?'   Her answer was, 'Yes, sir.'   'Very well then, he said, 'let's go in.' ...   Brother [Israel] Call, you have here read the statement of Brother [Homer M.] Brown [Patriarch of Granite Stake, and grandson of Benjamin Brown] concerning the Ten Tribes of Israel being upon another planet besides this. 'Yes, and I have heard my father [Anson] relate the same regarding the Ten Tribes, and father heard the Prophet make the same statement that the Ten Tribes are on a another planet, as related by Brother Brown. ([Signed] Israel Call, Given to High Councillor Theodore Tobiason, October 19th, 1924.)  September 28, 1931, the late Lorin C. Woolley related in the writers presence, of having asked Eliza R. Snow and John Van Cott to relate the Prophet's statement relative to the location of the 'Ten Tribes', and which was made by the Prophet at a meeting of a few Saints in Nauvoo. Joseph stated, according to these two parties, that the 'Ten Lost Tribes' were on a planet separated from this Earth by water and air. (Joseph W. Musser, Truth 7:182.)  In the course of his remarks he spoke of the earth being divided at various times. He said, “When Enoch and his City was taken away, a portion of the earth was taken and would again be restored. Also in the days of Peleg, the earth was divided, see Genesis 10th Chapter, 25th verse.” He then referred to the 'Ten Tribes' saying, “You know a long time ago in the days of Shalmanezar King of Assyria when the Ten Tribes was taken away, and never heard of since.” He said, “The Earth will be restored as at the beginning, and the last taken away will be the first to return; for the last shall be first, and the first will be last in all things.” He illustrated the return by saying: “Some of you brethren have been coming up the river on a steamboat, and while seated at the table, the steamboat run against a snag which upset the table and scattered the dishes; so it will be when these portions of the earth return. It will make the earth reel to and fro like a drunken man,” quoting 24th chapter [of] Isaiah, 20th verse. When speaking of the return of the Ten Tribes, he said, “The mountains of ice shall flow down at their presence, and a highway shall be cast up in the middle of the great deep.” (Wandle Mace Journal, 1809-1890, p. 38-39.)  “When the world was first made it was a tremendous big thing. The Lord concluded it was too big. We read in the scriptures that in the days of Peleg the earth was divided so the Lord divided the earth. When the ten tribes of the children of Israel went into the north country he divided it again, so the earth has been divided and subdivided. We also read in the scriptures that the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunken man. What shall cause this earth to reel to and fro like a drunken man? We read that the stars shall fall to the earth like a fig falling from a fig tree. When these stars return to the place where they were taken from, it will cause the earth to reel to and fro. Not that the planets will come squarely against one another, in such case both planets would be broken to pieces. But in their rolling motion they will come together where they were taken from which will cause the earth to reel to and fro.” (Joseph Smith, Winter 1840, Vincent Knight home, Samuel Holister Rogers Journal, p. 17.)  Coming in one day and seeing my geography on my lap, he [Jacob Hamblin] told [me] that the Prophet said to him that at the North Pole is [a] convex or cup shaped [depression] with the deepest sea resting there. The planet that belonged to that part of the world would in time return to its place, strike the earth at that part, complete the sphere. The result would be a 'reeling to and fro like a drunken man' by the Earth ... (Biographical Record of Martha Cragun Cox, p. 104. Church Historican Department.)  The stars which will fall to the Earth, are fragments, which have been broken off from the Earth from time to time, in the mighty convulsions of nature.... some with the Ten Tribes ... These must all be restored again at the 'times of the restitution of all things.' (This will restore the Ten Tribes of Israel;... (Parley P. Pratt, Millenial Star 1:258. - date?)  And when the Lord saw fit to hide The Ten Lost Tribes away, Thou, Earth, was severed to provide The orb on which they stay. (Eliza R. Snow, Address to Earth, Millenial Star 13:272.)  John the Revelator  The Spirit of the Lord fell upon Joseph in an unusual manner, and [he] prophesied that John the Revelator was then among the Ten Tribes of Israel who had been led away by Shalmaneser, King of Assyria to prepare them for their return from their long dispersion, to again possess the land of their fathers. (History of the Church, John Whitmer, see DHC 1:176., date?)  While 'the camp of Zion' was on the way to Missouri in 1834 Joseph was some ways ahead of the company one day, when there was seen walking with him by the roadside a man, a stranger. When the company came up there was no person with him. When at camp that night, Heber asked the Prophet who that man was; Joseph replied it was the beloved Disciple, John, who was then on his way to the Ten Tribes in the North. (Heber C. Kimball letter to Addison Everett, Oliver B. Huntington Journal, 13th January, 1881.)  Joseph said that John was to tarry until Christ came. He is now with the Ten Tribes preaching to them, and when we can get ready for them they will come. (Life of Levi Ward Hancock, June 4th, 1831.)"

Financially, a community college or small 2-year school (like Snow) may make a lot of sense for a year; you may get a scholarship, they are cheaper and most or all of the credits will transfer.  If you work you may still be able to cover your costs by working and going part-time.    Another option is the military/coast guard.  It can be a good path and cover your costs. Leaving brochures around can also scare some families into cooperating.  You could also look into Americorps, which has a 6-month domestic service program that covers your expenses and hands you a $5.5k scholarship at the end.  It could replace your mission experience when people ask your plans.  Just a thought.  You might take a look over at sidebar on the right in resources for missionaries for links and ideas."

I too have a masters degree now but even before I got it the only people that asked where I started where the admissions office of the new school.  Don't go there though it is a pain to transfer."
exmormon,3dlbhc,vh65,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:13 2015 UTC,One of my professors in my doctoral program started at the community college by the California town I moved to.  Then went to Berkeley and I want to say MIT.  A cheap college for a year won't give you the same experience but it won't hurt you.
exmormon,3dlbhc,StarTrekTherapy,5,Sat Jul 18 17:28:15 2015 UTC,You do not need their permission. You are an adult if you are 18. You need to immediately call the financial aid office of the college you are interested in. They will tell you your options.
exmormon,3dlbhc,Vepr762X54R,2,Fri Jul 17 11:37:50 2015 UTC,Sounds like it is about time to rip this band aid off.
exmormon,3dlbhc,Ua_Tsaug,2,Fri Jul 17 05:23:43 2015 UTC,"You might be backed into a corner on this one, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. You have a good plan, get a job, take out the necessary loans, etc, but be financially independent. Once you're independent, you can come forward with your real intentions: that you don't believe and consequently aren't going on a mission. It'll be hard to do, and most Mormons don't take the news well, but it might be better to do sooner rather than later. After all, you'd only be prolonging the inevitable by pretending to be Peter Priesthood. But it'll be worth it. You can enjoy your youth and not waste it on an unpaid sales job. You can have a normal college experience, without any burdensome commandments or meaningless rules that this cult seeks to place on you. You can take charge of your own life and be free."

exmormon,3dlbhc,exmolivingincanada,2,Fri Jul 17 16:26:16 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad choice if you're basing your decision on friends or whatnot. But if you're just going for the sake of going... community college is a much better option.  What you want at this stage of the game is freedom. Trust me I was in your shoes (going to a cheap 4 year college and all) not too long ago. Even at a cheap school, I was cornered, because even paying for a cheap 4 year college is not economically viable for someone who has no skills beyond minimum wage.   I ended up on a mission because I didn't have any leverage against my parents when I was going to school. I ended up at BYU for the same reason.  So I'll just tell you what I wish I would have told myself   You don't want to go on a mission. Its not worth it. You're not going to find yourself. Worst case scenario, you're just going to solidify some false oppressive beliefs. And best case, 2 years of your life has been taken from you. Community college credits, they transfer. What that means is instead of paying 500$ a credit at a 4 year college. You take the EXACT same class, which fulfills the EXACT same requirement to get the exact SAME degree (after you transfer to a 4 year uni after a year or so), and you will pay a fraction of the price. ALSO these classes are remarkably easier than 4 year universities where all of the 100 and 200 level classes are weeder courses for higher classes.    Don't make the same mistake I made, unless you're absolutely sure in one years time you will have the freedom to get out by yourself"
exmormon,3dlbhc,exmolivingincanada,2,Fri Jul 17 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"Actually if you can figure a way to get through college without loans you will be better off in the end.  Like the one poster said grants, finacial aid, military all good options.  Being a poor University student is easier than being an in debt Universtity graduate in my opinion.  I got my bachelors without a loan, I paid for my university on my own with some grants, small scholarships, working.  It took my 5 years but hey its better than spending the next 10 paying off a loan"

exmormon,3dlbhc,bananajr6000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:18:42 2015 UTC,"You are exhibiting symptoms of the COLDS' success at infantilizing the YM and YW. This is not a criticism, just advice for your situation; you need to become responsible for yourself at age 18.   You need to take charge and learn to do all the ""grown-up"" things like getting a job that will pay the bills, getting an apartment (understanding leases, contracts, etc.), transportation to/from said job, learning to budget, save, and set and reach goals on your own.  Your parents are not responsible for your education (although I would have no problem with you asking them to help if they were in a better position to). Your Grandma is not responsible for your education (although I have no problem with you asking her if she is in a position to help). I hope this makes sense.  Also, if you don't plan on going on a mission, you don't need their approval to get a student loan. Once the FAFSA is done, you are your own person and get your own student loans at age 18. Your parents aren't privileged to see that information; they don't even get to see your grades without your permission.   Talk to a school counselor about your potential for aid. Enthusiastically tell your parents that grants and school aid will pay for your education and that you just need the FAFSA. If they balk about this they really just don't want you to go to school, they just want to control you into going on a mission (and I suspect you may find this to be the case). Be sure to call them out on this if they do, saying that they just want to continue to tell you everything to do (like Satan if you need to go that harsh, but probably not on the first confrontation) and are against you getting an education. Then move out and become independent. If your parents still refuse to fill out the FAFSA, contact school counselors for what you can do about it. One year from the time you receive no financial support from your parents, you can petition to become an Independent Student (a legal designation) that will allow you to receive financial aid based on your own income. This means they cannot pay for anything for you; no cell phone, car insurance, etc.  A good alternative is Community College. Getting some gen-eds out of the way at a much cheaper cost is a good thing. Check with your potential target universities to ensure that the credits will transfer. If you complete an Associates degree, most colleges will give you about 60 credits worth of transfer credit, whether the original courses would have transferred for credit or not. Also look into guaranteed transfer programs in your state, where completing an Associates with a good enough grade point average will guarantee you a transfer to your university/program of choice.  Good life to you!"

Those discussions pop up periodically but this is more of a sub for people who are already conclusive in their leaving the church behind. It's partly a therapeutic place so you're going to see people piss and moan.  Sure some of it is immature and lame but people need to vent. What you're looking for is on Mormonthink.com
exmormon,3dobwq,william_law,2,Fri Jul 17 23:41:20 2015 UTC,mormondiscussions.com might be more up your alley.
exmormon,3dobwq,Chief_Joseph,2,Fri Jul 17 23:05:34 2015 UTC,Different strokes for different folks. Many people have a lot of built up emotion that they need to bleed off regarding their time in the church. If you ever reach the point where you decide it isn't true then perhaps you will understand. So we let those people vent. We're ok with that.  But if you want an intellectual discussion regarding the church I assure you you will find many members of this sub that would be very able to participate in it with you.   What would you like to discuss? What subject in particular?
exmormon,3dobwq,OneMoreLuckyGuy,2,Fri Jul 17 23:34:20 2015 UTC,"First of all, I disagree with everybody saying that this is a place to vent, or this is a place for recovery. I very much disagree with the person who stated that this isn't a place for people who are questioning. This sub is a lot of things to a lot of people and venting is not the primary focus on the group. If you want to take a look at the official description, it is to the right of this thread. The main goal of this place is to share news, commentary, and comedy. Intellectualism is only a part of that.  That being said, if you want to check out the intellectuals of the exmormon world, I would take a look at Robert Packham's work. Another person to check out would be Will Bagley. Other good sources are looking up resources from pretty much every mod here.  Lindsay Park's polygamy podcast deserves a good shoutout. Also, the front page of http://exmormon.org tends to have a ton of scholarly information, just avoid their forums if you are looking for intellectualism because their primary purpose is for recovery, not debating."

We're not here to put on a show or prove by some superficiality that we're intellectuals.  Thoughts and feelings on the sub are real and raw and uncensored."
exmormon,3dobwq,Giribgiribgoogob,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:35:23 2015 UTC,"I wish you well on your quest for answers, and hope you'll actually join the discussion rather than just lurking. I've done both, and believe me it's a lot more rewarding to be a ""part of the gang"" than to watch from the sidelines. Sorry you got so much blowback from your post, but if you read it again and ask yourself how you'd respond if a stranger walked up to you and said the same, you'd probably realize you kind of deserved it. If you need support we're here for you, if you need answers they are most assuredly out there. Whether you choose to take up either is up to you."
exmormon,3dobwq,bobiejean,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:19:20 2015 UTC,I used to come here primarily to vent. So I get that. I get where people are coming from why they do it why it helps but I also think you are right. I now find it more and more tiresome.
exmormon,3dobwq,antons_key,2,Fri Jul 17 23:14:21 2015 UTC,Then don't come here. Jesus. People sure love to whine.
exmormon,3dobwq,filmmaker30,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:28:59 2015 UTC,"The reason there isn't more intellectual discussion is because nothing in Mornonism has any foundation that stands up to intellectual discussion.  That's why there isn't any constant debate.  What can you debate?  The reason that everyone is emotional and angry is because the church has a mental and emotional vice grip on members and when they escape they are left with emotional wounds and must deal with being shunned and outcast by their closest friends and family.  Let this be a testimony of the manipulative, controlling influence of the church and how damaging it can be."
exmormon,3dobwq,The_Field_is_White,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:47:59 2015 UTC,"Haha. A mormon complaining about a lack of intellectualism, reasoning and logic. Nice one. This has to be a troll post."
exmormon,3dobwq,filmmaker30,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:26:21 2015 UTC,There are people who are at different stages of this chart
exmormon,3dobwq,Gileriodekel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:48:35 2015 UTC,"First: imagine for a second that your doubts turn into a long list of verifiable proof that the church is false. Imagine how you would feel, and the subsequent fallout from choices you would then have to make, and I think you will understand why things go the way they do here sometimes. The losses are pervasive and profound.   Second: Mormonthink is a good place to go, along with the recent essays the church has released. The links are all easily accessible on churchessays.com (please tell me I have the link right...). The church essays point to major issues with the truths we were raised with/taught. Between the Book of Abraham essay and the polygamy essays, the conclusion seems pretty clear. At best, Joseph Smith was very ill. At worst, he was a con artist devoid of any empathy or conscience.   Even if you set all that aside, even if you have widespread kindness and generosity at the ward and even the stake level, bigotry and deceit are still at the heart of the institution that claims to be Christ's one true church -  informing administrative and ministerial decisions today.   I wish you luck on your journey, and hope you can be patient and understanding with the people working through this massive heartbreak."

You don't need anti-material to begin your quest. My shelf started to break just from these two things alone."

exmormon,3dobwq,ExConned,0,Sat Jul 18 09:04:01 2015 UTC,"after reading many posts of people venting you just may start to see underlying trends and causes, you begin to notice different patterns of thought, attitude, and mentality of people in various stages of recovery and of thought and meditation  the room for debate here seems to be between those who believe that the church works for some people (the ones taking advantage of and exerting unjust dominion over everyone else) and that that is enough to overlook the lives it harms and destroys and those who believe that like racism, homophobia, discrimination, and hate this organization and others like it have no place in our society  this is a place where people can see the church for what it is: a camouflaged symbol of hate  bring it down like that damned flag  I see an organization that lies to its members and holds their families and relationships ransom  I believe in freedom of belief and I believe that most if not all churches, and this one in particular, are fundamentally evil, this was created by people who used ""revelation"" and ""scripture"" to convince other people to “covenant to give of our resources in time and money and talent—all we are and all we possess—to the interest of the kingdom of God upon the earth” which he has conveniently appointed them stewards over  they beheaded people for interracial marriage for ""christsake"" less than 200 years ago - the fact that most other religions condoned and perpetrated even more heinous crimes against humanity doesn't make it any better. how are these institutions of hate allowed to go unchallenged in their assertions of virtue? how are their beliefs ""protected"" from the TRUTH?  magicians are required to give disclaimers that their ""miracles"" are illusion and for entertainment purposes only for a reason right?  individuals torture themselves trying to rationalize and merge the mythology with the real world they find themselves in, it is madness, it is futile, it's like trying to convince yourself that blue is red  families have and are being torn apart  there are people who have actually said that they believe that it's possible that they are descendents of Cain who was cursed with black skin for killing his brother because they sinned before being born   there are millions whose sexuality has been ruined by the church  there are people living today with scars from electrical burns on their arms and genitals because of this organization and some are so brainwashed and damaged that they have developed stockholm syndrome and they actually believe it helped them   there many more with scars that do not show on the outside  Enough is enough and any amount of abuse, manipulation, and hatred is not acceptable  END THE CULT"
exmormon,3dobwq,tscc5415,0,Fri Jul 17 23:30:59 2015 UTC,My advice?...Move on....
exmormon,3dobwq,grandelusion,0,Fri Jul 17 23:30:57 2015 UTC,I think you'd probably find a bit more of that over at the new order mormon site. Although I've found the conversations there to be a bit lacking in intellectual inquiry as well. This is no the sub you are looking for!
