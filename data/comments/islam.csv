What exactly is unbeneficial about asking oneself questions of aqeedah and seeking answers? Does the Quran not invite us to reflect upon both the Creator and the creation?   I personally find this mindset off putting and see no valid basis for the claim that those who dedicate their life or part of it to seeking knowledge in any particular area (including theology) are less sincere or grounded in their faith than the layman."

Edit: Okay, so I did some youtube video, while it does not address the Hadith or my memory of the interpretation, it addresses the two women equaling one man in the Quran:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efCs_sipESQ  I mean, the way he explains it, it does make sense technically."
islam,3e3w73,shadowlightfox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:40 2015 UTC,"People sometimes site this hadith w/o citing the Qur'an and other ahadith that make it clear. Sometimes they'll quote Qur'an 2:282 and make blanket statements, but they'll ignore 24:6-11 even tho’ it’s the exact same logic.   Let's break it down in simple terms:   Qur’an 2:282: This verse is about documenting deferred financial transaction, and it’s being very specific. This is not a general principle of law or a wholistic statement, it’s not addressing courts or legal system, it’s only addressing the participants in the transaction.  In fact, Law of Ri’an makes woman’s testimony more worth than that of 4 men plus her own husband. And this is a legal verdict and it is addressed in the courts: However, again, it’s very specific and not a general rule. See Qur’an 24:6-11. There is no situation where a man’s testimony is worth 5 women. Actually, the verse starts w/ two men, not one. Some actually think man is deficient, but the verse explains and lists 3 reasons:     It’s more equitable, more reliable as testimony, more likely to prevent doubts.    Women hadn’t had experience yet, and the prevailing attitude of pagans was still really antagonistic. See 16:57-59. Part of the Qur’an was to include them “among such are as acceptable to you as witnesses”  At that time, society’s economic & legal domininion extended to the pagans and the christians & the jews. This resulted in a very confined role for women. The pagans commited infanticide and the People of the Book considered woman to be the downfall of man. The Qur’an wipes these notions away. People forget that the Muhammad pbuh didn’t just call to a new religion, he called for a social revolution. Deferred financial transactions. were not typically a woman’s concern  (Khadijah rAa being a main exception). The varying types of consignment, terms, conditions for leases & sales in the market place, all these things were unknown to predominently illiterate women. It’s all very new, unfamiliar & confusing.  The Qur’an doesn’t ignore them, it adds them in and supports their transittion. Notice women are called to support women…The verse doesn’t anticipate a woman will forget, it says “If one forgets…”.  What this all accomplished, in this historical timeline, is that women were now “among those whom you deem appropriate as witnesses”. That was not the case with anyone before that, not the Christians, not the Jews, not the Romans, neither the Pagans, Greeks, Persians, etc.    ~source: my minor is women's studies."
islam,3e1f88,Xxxn00bpwnR69xxX,40,Tue Jul 21 05:33:16 2015 UTC,"This extends to Muslims in general, that differences of opinion are a vital aspect of Islamic scholarship and that ascribing to a particular viewpoint has nothing to do with liberal or conservative but rather the strength in evidences.  Why is this so important? I feel like extremism comes from young Muslims reducing complex problems to simple black and white solutions, then separating all Muslims in the world into those two groups; either you're rigid in following Islam by the books or you're a hypocrite that is yielding to ""the kuffar"". Anyone that accepts a different opinion that happens to be more lax is purely doing so because their Islamic faith is weak.  Such thinking is extremely harmful and breeds close mindedness. We need to educate kids on the existence and legitimacy of differences of scholarly opinion and how religious scholarship works.  I mention this for non Muslims also because it may help them understand why some Muslims can appear to be extremely intelligent and knowledgeable about the faith yet they don't take up arms in violence. It's because they took the time to learn about the complexity of Islam and what it actually facilitates for."
islam,3e1f88,greengrasser11,22,Tue Jul 21 06:20:24 2015 UTC,"That things like ""giving up"" pork and alcohol and praying five times a day isn't the ""hard"" part. That comes naturally with the acceptance of Islam as the truth. The ""hard"" part is the internal purification (ie being pure in our intentions, not getting angry, arrogant, jealous, etc.). Still, life in islam is easier than life in unbelief from my experience.  I'd also like people to know about things like how smelling nice (ie using cologne/perfume) and personal hygiene are sunnah. Also, with the right intention things like working out and eating to nourish ourselves (taking care of the body Allah loaned us) can be acts of worship. There's even reward for all the things that come with marriage and family, from intercourse with a spouse to financial support of the household. Even picking up a piece of garbage can be considered charity, and so can smiling at somebody. Every little good deed counts (and is multiplied) while every bad deed counts but isn't multiplied and can be removed from sincere repentance.  Another thing I'd like people to know is that we believe Allah to extremely forgiving (to those who sincerely repent), and there are plenty of hadith and verses  of Quran (where Allah is called Al Ghafoor-Most Forgiving) to back this up.  Panther thing I love is the scholarly tradition, especially the way that after making any sort of ruling or statement backed by evidence in Quran and sunnah, and after years of study to ground their understanding of the arabic language, context of revelation and hadith (sayings of our Prophet sallallahu 'alayhi wa salaam), the scholar adds ""and Allah knows best"" to conclude. No one can say they know something for sure if it wasn't directly revealed, and we can't say for sure who is going to heaven and who's going to hell."

I'm sometimes struck by the fact that even though I want and strive for things just like any other person; ever since I accepted Islam the feeling of 'emptiness' that haunted me and sunk me into depression for years in my youth is absolutely gone. I tried everything to fill it for practically my whole life and nothing gave me the peace that Islam has given me.

Specifically, shouldn't a ""well designed religion"" make it so absolutely clear that killing innocents in the name of that religion is forbidden that no one would claim such things are justified.  Let's take the Jewish religion and the Jewish bible as examples. Nowhere does is explicitly say in the Bible that rape is forbidden. Nowhere does is say there that slavery is forbidden (on the contrary - it specifies the  rules governing slavery). So one could claim the Jewish bible could be improved by adding these two laws.   In the same direction - couldn't one improve the Quran by saying ""under no circumstances whatsoever is the killing of children or raping of women justified""? Not because the vast majority of Muslims don't already know this - of course they do. Almost all Muslims are moral people.

However, there will always be those who twist the verses or take them out of context.   The central authority is the Quran and Hadith, and both require knowledge in understanding these sources.  The Quran requires more than just reading the translation, you need to grasp the tafseer (the explanations) of the verses. For some people who wield the religion as a weapon, they interpret (without adequate knowledge) the verses to fit THEIR goals. Brainwashing and making a cult out of their own interpretation follow after.  And men were made not to be ""controlled"", but to worship with faith. The struggle that we go through in our attempts to follow our faith is a form of reward, both in understanding life in this world and the hereafter. We will wane, and we will sin.

islam,3e1f88,6aff,0,Tue Jul 21 11:26:07 2015 UTC,The gym does not claim to have divine wisdom and divine authority behind it. And it does not threaten you with eternal torment if you don't exercise. Religion does.
islam,3e1f88,shaim2,2,Tue Jul 21 11:31:33 2015 UTC,"What creates the discrepancy between behaviour and faith (bad actions despite the perfect faith) is that as humans, we usually forego long-term gratification for short-term satisfaction. Divine authority is awesome because it gives us humans the ability to choose and act. Willpower. The objective is to see whether we believe and act upon our faith for eternal blessing or otherwise. Knowing and understanding that there is hell (literally) to pay if I don't do what is right does not actually 'cleanse' you from your humanistic attributes ie, jealousy, aggression, greed etc. It is the struggle to be upright for Allah that rewards us."

islam,3e1f88,R9014,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget the 99 names. ""Al-Wadud"" being one of them.   Found this on another forum:  ""Al-Wadud is the one who desires good for all mankind; he does good for them, and he praises them. This name approximates the concept underlying ar-Rahim, But compassion is related to the object of mercy, and the object of mercy is the needy one and the one under compulsion. The deeds of the compassionate one presuppose an object of mercy who is weak, whereas deeds of al-Wadud do not require that. Indeed, acts of kindness from the outset belong to the products of love. Just as the meaning of the compassion of God Most High is His desiring good for the object of mercy and His being sufficient (to bring) it (about) while remaining above the empathy (usually associated with human) compassion, likewise His Love is His desiring honour and favour (for man), and is His (actual) beneficence and His bounty, while He remains above the feeling of love. But love and mercy are desired in respect of their objects only for the sake of their fruit and benefit and not because of empathy or feeling. Thus the benefit is the quintessence of mercy and love and the spirit of these two. That is the conception (of these two characteristics) in respect of God Most High to the exclusion of that which (in human experience) accompanies them but is not a condition of producing the benefit.  An Admonition: Al-Wadud among men is the one who desires for the creatures of God everything which he desires for himself. Even higher is the one who prefers the others to himself, even as one of them said, ""I wish that I were a bridge over the fire upon which the people might pass over (safely) and not be harmed by it.""The perfection of that (characteristic in man) is that one should not be restrained from affection and beneficence by anger, hatred or (resentment) of that harm done to one, even as the messenger of God said-may blessings and peace be upon him - when his teeth were broken and his face was bloodied (at the Battle of Uhud), “O God, guide my people for they do not know."" (Even) their evil action did not prevent (the prophet) from desiring (only) good for them; or again as he - may the blessings of God be upon him and his family - commanded Ali when he said, ""If you desire to be before even the angels, remain friendly to the one who has denied you, give to the one who has deprived you and forgive the one who has dealt unjustly with you.”  Source: Al-Maqsad Al-Asna Fi Sharh Asma' Allah Al-Husna By Imam al-Ghazali"

islam,3e1f88,d0e1ow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"Read my other post. Divine love takes contextualizing I think, just as Divine wrath does, or Divine mercy.   I think to make the assertion that ""Well, God loves us like we experience love."" is insipid, and I can see how my original post could be read like that.   If we're going to admit that God's love is a system, or feeling, or state of being that transcends what we experience (and it is), then the same would have to hold true for all the attributes of God, even God's wrath or displeasure. If God doesn't experience love in the way that we do, then does He experience hate in the same way?   For humans, hate is the key to failure, spiritual death, and a disconnection from the heart. It's like drinking poison. The secret of the heart is love, and this is something we clearly see recurring in the teachings of the Prophets. The Psalms, the life of Christ, the teaching of Muhammad, they lead us to this point, where justice and love are the foundation of a strong community and strong spirit.   Who has planted the seeds in our hearts, capable of mercy and love? None other than the Creator. These are gifts, given to us freely, and given to us out of Divine love."

Zakat fitrah once every year, Zakat Mal once every year, even if your children are born it is sunnah to perform aqiqah (okay this is not the same as zakat, but you get the idea), and the list goes on.  Yes men are allowed to have more than one wives, with a condition that you need to treat all of your wives equally. I can't really imagine how to make sure that you treat one of your wife well enough without making the other jealous. If you can imagine it, good for you.  Did you know that the very very first part of Quran told to Muhammad is literally ""to read"" (or recite, depends on your translation of ""Iqra"" I suppose)? If I want to tell people something big, I would start with the most important thing first, would you?    For me, Islam does not start by taking someone's life, or wishing destruction of certain country or race. It starts by reading. Did somebody told you that there's this hadith that forbid you to do this and that? Read first, is it true? what is the basis and background of the hadith? Did your imam told you to do this and that? ask and read, what was his source. Because at the start, we are told by Muhammad to read. But maybe this is a wrong way of thinking, I dunno."

Let me put it to you this way, if I want to rob a bank in paradise to get the thrill of it, my Lord can easily create a world like that for me so I can experience it.    What you're trying to assert is that I can go murder someone in heaven for the thrill of it, but it would not be haram because eveything has no barriers. That is the essence of foolishness. There will be no haram in the sense there is nothing to trigger it off. Jealousy won't exist, uncleanliness won't exist, sodomy won't exist, adultry won't exist, murder won't exist, theft won't exist. Those things are natural pains to us, corruptions on this earth, all of that is eradicated. You will be created as a new person in heaven with new experiences.

Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.  Surah al-Bakarah v:6-7  I understand that we as Muslims, can't help but feel a little hurt  by some of the things they say. For instance, when the honour of Prophet Muhammad is played  around with. Here's the thing, The Messenger of Allah was honoured by The Supreme Creator of the worlds Himself. Whatever is said by such lowly people can never influence the status that Allah has given him. It's basically like a person looking at the moon, and trying to spit at it, because he doesn't like it. Is that going to do anything to it, even slightly?

This is because Syria, compared to Makkah, has a wealth of sources with regards to Judaism and Christianity. Therefore, critics said that Prophet Muhammad stole ideas from these two religions when he was in Syria and created a super-religion combining the two. The reference to olives is thought to be a remnant or evidence that the Quran was cultivated in Syria due to olives being cultivated in Syria.  However, classical islamic sources instead frequently mentioned that the Prophet is an ummi, which in one source means that he cannot read, and other sources, means that he is unlearned in Judaism and Christian traditions and remained woefully ignorant of the two."
islam,3e20ls,jacquesrabbit,3,Tue Jul 21 18:34:14 2015 UTC,"The fallacy of such orientalist criticisms are that they assume that the normative view is false simply by virtue of having non-Western origins. The history about early Islam is really good, far more reliable than the history for essentially any other time period for any other civilization, and there is no dispassionate/objective reason to call it into question other than the orientalist fallacy of ""the arabs/muslims must be lying.""   Further, there are still verdant and lush areas of Saudi Arabia to this day, such as around Fifaa. If you also take a look at charcoal farming in Brazil, you  notice that over-farming the land can cause a deficit in nutrients, which in turn can lead to desolation of the soil (dessication leads to the formation of deserts) and render it infertile. So, just because a patch of land is infertile today, it does not make even a tiny amount of sense to say that this means that it was infertile 1400 years ago.   Hopefully that explains why the claim is wrong, and also why you should ignore fringe morons and stick to actual historians, all of whom are in agreement over the accuracy and factual nature of the Islamic account of its own history."
islam,3e20ls,deranged_derpcat,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"In addition to my last post, this Byzantine Roman report about the army of Khalid ibn Walid (RA) proves that the Arabs of the time did have a supply of olives:   . . . Muhammad . . . priest, Mār Elijah . . . and they came . . . and . . . and from . . . strong . . . month . . . and the Romans {fled} . . . And in January {the people} of Emesa received assurances for their lives. Many villages were destroyed through the killing by {the Arabs of} Muhammad and many people were killed. And captives {were taken} from the Galilee to Bēt . . . Those Arabs camped by {Damascus}. We saw . . . everywhere . . . and the {olive oil} that they {had brought} and . . . them. On the twenty-sixth of May, {the sacellarius} went . . . from Emesa. The Romans pursued them . . . On the tenth {of August} . . . the Romans fled from Damascus . . . many, about ten thousand. The following year, the Romans came. On the twentieth of August in the year nine hundred and forty-seven [636 c.e.] there assembled in Gabitha . . . the Romans and many people were killed, from the Romans about fifty thousand . . . In the year nine hundred and forty-{eight} . . .   -from the Chronicle to 640:  By the 660s, we have our first detailed narrative of Muhammad's life from a non-Muslim source, this time from an Armenian source, pseudo-Sebeos:   At that time a certain man from among those same sons of Ishmael whose name was Mahmet, a merchant, as if by God’s command appeared to them as a preacher [and] the path of truth. He taught them to recognize the God of Abraham, especially because he was learned and informed in the history of Moses. Now because the command was from on high, at a single order they all came together in unity of religion. Abandoning their vain cults, they turned to the living God who had appeared to their father Abraham. So Mahmet legislated for them: not to eat carrion, not to drink wine, not to speak falsely, and not to engage in fornication. He said: ‘With an oath God promised this land to Abraham and his seed after him for ever. And he brought about as he promised during that time while he loved Israel. But now you are the sons of Abraham, and God is accomplishing his promise to Abraham and his seed for you. Love sincerely only the God of Abraham, and go and seize your land which God gave to your father Abraham. No one will be able to resist you in battle, because God is with you.'   Further, one most remember that, prior to the rise of Islam, western Arabia was relatively unimportant. There was no reason to write about it until Islam rose up and revolutionized the entire ancient world overnight, heralding its end.   It's also worth noting Tom Holland is a popular historian, who as far as I'm aware doesn't speak any languages pertinent to early Islam, is almost entirely reliant on the writings of revisionist historians like Patricia Crone."

Mecca, a place notoriously dry and barren, is not, most agronomists would agree, an obvious spot for cattle ranching—just as the volcanic dust that constitutes its soil is signally unsuited to making “grain grow, and vines, fresh vegetation, olive trees, date palms, luscious gardens, fruit and fodder.Yet God, according to the Prophet, had furnished the Mushrikun with all of these blessings. Nothing, of course, is impossible for the Almighty—but it would indeed have been a miracle had Mecca truly been adorned with spreading “gardens of vines, olives, and pomegranates.”These, if they were to be found in seventh-century Arabia at all, would have been confined to oases, or else to Nabataea and the Negev, where the desert, by the lifetime of the Prophet, had been made to bloom, and agriculture was flourishing as never before amid the desolate bleakness of the sands   The book goes into details about these issues and I think you should personally read it if you're curious about this matter."

Malik is even quoted as saying, “We did not consider knowledge of those who did not write it down to be [real] knowledge.” We thus also find Hadiths in which the Prophet allows new Muslims visiting from outside Medina to record lessons he gave in a sermon.” (Source: Jonathan Brown “Hadith Muhammed’s Legacy in the Medieval and Modern World” page 21)   While I have not personally read it, I have heard a lot of good about Jonathan Brown's book, so if you wish, read it.

islam,3e20ls,waste2muchtime,-5,Tue Jul 21 10:52:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you but this is not what I'm asking. What I ask is some written source from that time. What is the earliest hadith collection, sirah or some other Islamic source?"
islam,3e20ls,vestayekta,9,Tue Jul 21 10:58:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a scholar of Hadith, so I'm afraid I can't answer your question. If you're looking for primary primary sources e.g the parchments themselves from at the time, maybe they are in musea, or maybe they are with scholars, or maybe they have faded over 1400 years. You'd have to ask a scholar where they are, if they are. Again, the book would most likely point you to primary sources."
islam,3e20ls,waste2muchtime,-5,Tue Jul 21 11:02:37 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I'm discussing here. Nothing much remains from the time of Mohammed and  historians can't rely on traditional sources like Muslims do.  I may be mistaken but as far as I know the earliest written sources date back to 8th century and even these sources are only accessible through later works.   Read more about this topic here  The thing is that we all are making assumptions about Mohammad's life and that's the problem Holland is discussing in his book. You can criticize  Holland's work as much as you like but that doesn't change the fact that the same criticism could be leveled at Muslim scholars.

However those who related the hadith would often be different people relating the same hadith through different chains of narration that it would be impossible to have such agreement on the word said without it being true.  As far as the earliest manuscripts go, fragments of Malik's Muwatta was dated to his own life, less than 150 years after the prophet. The earliest is Sahifa Hammam b. Munabih containing 18 divine hadiths dated to the first century AH. There's other manuscripts that are dated a little later but that contain references to earlier written works compiled during the prophet's life that don't have surviving manuscripts but are considered reliable indicators of those early works' existence. It's similar to how the works of Greek philosophers like Plato and Aristotle got passed down, through secondary sources that copied cited and translated the original.   The sheer amount of early written work and references cited within them to even earlier works makes it difficult to pay much attention to orientalists who claim this was all made up or didn't happen."

islam,3e20ls,Elijahquestions,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:17 2015 UTC,"This is a very long time.    Not really. There will be over a 100 year difference between me and my grandfather (born 1923) who passed away when I was 14 in just a few years, and I'm under 30. My great grandmother from the other side was born before 1910 and she passed away when I was around 13-14. By the time I'm 60-70 years old, 150 years ago is basically my grandfather/great grandmother told me what happened during their life. If I cared enough to write down that story, as many hundreds did during the time of the prophet as his words were considered so important, then 150 years across hundreds possibly thousands of people isn't as long as you think.   You keep repeating yourself without providing a source to support your claim.    There 6 main books of hadith referred to by Sunnis written by 6 different hadith collectors between 100-200 years after the death of the prophet. In those, the number of repeated hadiths (same hadith, different narration chains and slight variations in wording)  in each book number in the thousands. There are several other hadith books beyond these six.  Then there's the 4 main Shia hadith books, the earliest collected around the same time frame. Those contain completely different chains of narration as the two groups didn't trust each others' narrators. Outside the areas of sunni/shia contention, there is huge overlap in the narrations from the prophet. Hadiths in these books number in the thousands as well, with each containing thousands of repeated hadiths.  Then you have other works, such as Sahifa Sajjadiyya considered mutawatir and written by the prophet's great grandson.  There's also the sahifa sadiqa written by Abdullah b. Amr b. Anas during the prophet's lifetime and referred to in many later works such as Bukhari and Muslim.  Then you have the historical works by Ibn Ishaq and Abu Mikhnaf written less than 100 years after the prophet's death and which we have to this day. There are even earlier works like Ibn Zubayr and al-Zuhri's histories which did not survive but are referenced in later works.  I could keep going if you wish. The number of books written within 100-200 years after the prophet's death are in the hundreds if not thousands. There's plenty of disagreement in them about different statements and who said what, but the one thing that every single one of them agrees on are the basic facts: Muhammad (pbuh) was a messenger, the basics of worship, the basic facts of his life, and the Qur'an.   That alone tells you that to entertain the idea that hundreds of different authors were lying along with the thousands more from whom they have collected history and narrations better bring something better than ""assumptions."" It's so bizarre to think that such a huge number of people can keep a lie straight between them with such little variation, not to mention what is the motivation anyway for such a lie, it borders on the ludicrous."

The Arabic used in the Constitution of Medina reported by Ibn Hisham and Ibn Ishaq is also archaic, so it is taken to be from the the period of the prophet  beyond doubt as well.  There is also a Roman passage from modern-day Tunisia that reads:   Justus answered and said, “Indeed you speak the truth, and this is the great salvation: to believe in Christ. For I confess to you, master Jacob, the complete truth. My brother Abraham wrote to me that a false prophet has appeared. Abraham writes, ‘When [Sergius] the candidatus was killed by the Saracens, I was in Caesarea, and I went by ship to Sykamina. And they were saying, “The candidatus has been killed,” and we Jews were overjoyed. And they were saying, “A prophet has appeared, coming with the Saracens and he is preaching the arrival of the anointed one who is to come, the Messiah.” And when I arrived in Sykamina, I visited an old man who was learned in the scriptures, and I said to him,   “What can you tell me about the prophet who has appeared with the Saracens?” And he said to me, groaning loudly, “He is false, for prophets do not come with a sword and a war-chariot. Truly the things set in motion today are deeds of anarchy, and I fear that somehow the first Christ that came, whom the Christians worship, was the one sent by God, and instead of him we will receive the Antichrist. Truly, Isaiah said that we Jews will have a deceived and hardened heart until the entire earth is destroyed. But go, master Abraham, and find out about this prophet who has appeared.” And when I, Abraham, investigated thoroughly, I heard from those who had met him that one will find no truth in the so-called prophet, only the shedding of human blood. In fact, he says that he has the keys of paradise, which is impossible.’ These things my brother Abraham has written from the East.”"

islam,3e2e6i,sword_and_shield,4,Tue Jul 21 16:08:13 2015 UTC,"The children of Israel’s character as the chosen people is conditioned by obedience to God’s commandment.  Allah did aforetime take a Covenant from the Children of Israel, and appointed twelve Chieftains among them. And Allah said: “I am with you: IF you (but) establish regular prayers, pay zakah, believe in My Messengers, honor and assist them, and loan to Allah a beautiful loan, verily I will wipe out from you your evils, and admit you to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath; but if any of you, after this, resists faith, he has truly wandered from the path of rectitude. (5:12)  O Children of Israel, Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you; and fulfil my covenant and I shall fulfil your covenant (2:40)  Here God speaks of the special covenant of the Children of Israel. Allah says that He has fulfilled His part of the covenant, and it is now the turn of the Children of Israel to fulfill their part. The verses following the above would make it clear how they were expected to fulfill the covenant. Surah 2 verses 41 – 48 say what means:  And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me. And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience]. Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason? And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive [to Allah ]. Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him. O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds. And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be aided.  Through Qur’an, the promise still stands but God’s covenant is not unconditional. The fulfilment of God’s covenant is linked with the covenant Bani Israel made with God.  Yet, despite all this, the Children of Israel were ungrateful to the All-Merciful; and instead of worshipping Him alone, they took to idolatry: They defiantly broke God’s commandments given in the Torah. They insulted the prophets and even plotted against their lives. They have been put under humiliation [by Allaah] wherever they were overtaken, except for a covenant from Allaah and a treaty from the people, and Allaah made of them apes and pigs, and so forth. To conclude, the Jews were preferred over other people at the time of their Prophets, may Allaah exalt their mention, as they sometimes obeyed them, but most of the time they belied them and even killed them.   And [recall] when We made an appointment with Moses for forty nights. Then you took [for worship] the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers.[2:51] And [recall] when We took your covenant, [O Children of Israel, to abide by the Torah] and We raised over you the mount, [saying], “Take what We have given you with determination and remember what is in it that perhaps you may become righteous.”[2:63] Then you turned away after that. [2:64] And you had already known about those who transgressed among you concerning the sabbath, and We said to them, “Be apes, despised.” [2:65] And [recall] when We took the covenant from the Children of Israel, [enjoining upon them], “Do not worship except Allah ; and to parents do good and to relatives, orphans, and the needy. And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give zakah.” Then you turned away, except a few of you, and you were refusing. And [recall] when We took your covenant, [saying], “Do not shed each other’s blood or evict one another from your homes.” Then you acknowledged [this] while you were witnessing.[2:83-84] Then, you are those [same ones who are] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes, cooperating against them in sin and aggression.[2:85] And We did certainly give Moses the Torah and followed up after him with messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Pure Spirit. But is it [not] that every time a messenger came to you, [O Children of Israel], with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And a party [of messengers] you denied and another party you killed. [2:87]  So, Israelites broke their covenant thus cancelling their right to live in the land that is promised to them. And Allah says in Qur’an:  My covenant includes not wrongdoers. (2:124)"

Say, ""Then why does He punish you for your sins?"" Rather, you are human beings from among those He has created. He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills.

islam,3e07u1,Hauzron,5,Mon Jul 20 23:17:18 2015 UTC,"I signed up on those forums many years ago because I was looking for people to discuss Islam with and learn more about the religion from. I left pretty quickly because of the sheer number of bigots and scumbags that populated the place at the time. No idea what it is like now, but I can't imagine I'll head back any time soon.  Discussion was non-existent on there, it was loads of people berating others for daring to use their head or having the sheer nerve to have an opinion about anything that wasn't borderline extreme. If I were a kaffir and those forums had been my only experience of Muslims, I can't imagine I'd hold Muslims or Islam in anything but a negative light."

islam,3e07u1,rainmeterhelp,17,Tue Jul 21 00:57:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's funny that some find /r/Islam liberal and some find it conservative.   I thought I was somewhat conservative.. then I came to /r/Islam. I've seen liberal... this ain't liberal.   When you get posts from someone trying to get married who is worried if talking to a girl in public to get to know her is halal, people telling someone marrying a Christian woman to break it off now, people advocating gender segregation, describing women who wear jeans with their hijab or wear a bit of color as bad hijab, and saying music is haram, then know for sure that you are among the very conservative."
islam,3e07u1,autumnflower,15,Tue Jul 21 01:15:09 2015 UTC,"I remember someone had asked a similar question a few years ago and a person responded with a very beautiful comment that I wish I had saved. It was definitely /r/bestofislam worthy.  To summarize it (with much less eloquence than the original), liberal and conservative are meaningless terms when applied to Islam. A Muslim does not strive to be ""liberal"" or ""conservative"", but rather to adhere as much as possible to what they believe to be the sunnah of the Prophet (saws). The question a Muslim asks themselves is not whether a stance is liberal or conservative but whether the evidence presented to them for that stance is enough to convince them that this is what Allah (swt) wants from them. If that's fulfilled, a Muslim listens and obeys.  I finished a great biography on Sh. Akram Nadwi before Ramadan began. There was one passage that really resonated with me and I think describes this concept very well:  When I tell people that I am studying with a Muslim scholar, the first thing non-Muslims usually want to know is what kind of Muslim scholar. ""A moderate?"" they'll ask. ""Or a fundamentalist?"" Or sometimes, ""Is he liberal or conservative?"" The terms vary; the subtext doesn't: Is he ""one of us""? Or ""one of them""? This is the language we are left with, after the trauma of recent decades. It's now too easy to slot people into the neat grooves worn by the media and the ""clash of civilizations"" crowd.   But how to characterize the Sheikh? Hours in the library with a stack of books on modern Islamic movements didn't help. Does his work on women scholars make him progressive? Do his calls to return to the Quran and traditions of the Prophet make him a reformist, or a neotraditionalist? Do his literal readings of the Quran on the flames of hell and the lush gardens of paradise make him a Salafi or a Wahhabi?   The more I studied with the Sheikh, the less helpful I found all the available labels, both Western and Muslim. What is the Sheikh, anyway? A traditionally trained scholar who scandalizes conservatives and disappoints progressives. And sometimes just the reverse. A champion of women's rights who accepts that Islam allows polygamy. A defender of individual conscience, but not Western-style individualism. A champion of creative thought, so long as it's based on proper Islamic scholarship and classical sources. Think for yourselves, he counsels students, but don't change Islam's God-given Truth. ""The Message,"" he cautions, ""is the Message."" He is traditional, yet is frequently criticized by others claiming to be traditional. He is a proponent of fundamentals who draws fire from fundamentalists. Every time I thought I'd found a term to describe him, the opposite also seemed to apply. To try to categorize the Sheikh was to flail.  As it turned out, flailing was entirely appropriate. I discovered this, to my relief, when I visited Tim Winter, a professor of Islamic studies at Cambridge University. Trying to fit Islamic thinkers into Western categories was a nonstarter, he told me. ""Islam doesn't have a spectrum,"" said Winter, who also goes under his Muslim name, Abdal Hakim Murad. ""There are Muslims who come from very literalist traditions who are massively pro-women. There are others who are very mystical, but also very political. Any combination is possible. The danger is always when you try to impose the idea that Christianity is the default religion."" I left Winter's office vowing to try to avoid rigid categories. I'd flail on."

If a so-called 'liberal' view has better reasoning then the other, then we should go by that, likewise, if a 'conservative' view has better reasoning then we should go by it. Constructing views to only to gratify our personal ideals in matters of religion, will only ever lead us away from the truth, and in doing so, we'll only ever desire to justify our self-perceived notions and conclusively shut ourselves from any and all objectiveness and open-mindedness. Can you call yourself an adherent to the 'truth' when all that matters to you is circle-jerking your own ideals."

Either way, most legitimate Muslim countries accept the rights of Jews and Christians, as Iran, Egypt, and Indonesia have a considerable amount of Christians (and Jews for Iran) under their rule. Anyway, doubt the more strict Muslim countries would want to give homosexuals equal rights, in general other  groups would have more rights."

Its the same as pre/extra-marital sex.  As for gay marriage, this is something that is not recognised in Islam however I don't know how an Islamic state would treat gay marriage outside of the Muslim community as I am not a scholar. What I can say is that traditionally, rule under the caliphate allowed for different courts/ judges for different religions/ communities so that you may be judged by your own moral rules. (I.e. Muslims could go to the Islamic court to settle a dispute over an Islamic issue/ crime and other religious groups could go to their own for their issues.) I believe general criminal issues were dealt with centrally by the government courts but civil issues had separate systems for separate people."

Surah Fatiha on the other hand is a requirement for every rakat.  What I am curious about is if you still recite Surah Fatiha behind the Imam. I've heard different views on it.

islam,3e00da,ImmortalTrader,2,Mon Jul 20 23:24:47 2015 UTC,"http://islamqa.info/en/6422   It also indicates that reciting a soorah after al-Faatihah is mustahabb. There is scholarly consensus on this point with regard to Fajr, Jumu’ah and the first two rak’ahs of every prayer, and this is Sunnah according to all scholars. Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that some of the companions of Maalik said that reciting a second soorah is obligatory, but this is an odd view which is to be rejected.   With regard to reciting an additional soorah in the third and fourth rak’ahs, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether it is mustahabb or not. Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) regarded it as makrooh. Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah be pleased with him) regarded it as mustahabb in his new opinion but not in his old opinion; the old opinion in this case is more correct.   Sharh Muslim, 4/105, 106.   Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:   According to the majority of scholars, reciting another soorah (after al-Faatihah) is Sunnah and is not obligatory, because it is obligatory to recite only al-Faatihah.    TL;DR   1st and 2nd rakat it is recommended to pray another surah after fatiha.  3rd and 4th rakat there is a difference of opinion but what is sure is that it is neither obligatory nor forbidden to recite another surah after fatiha.

islam,3dzzr9,Sigfreedsolomon,0,Tue Jul 21 08:59:29 2015 UTC,"No true scotsman - depends on which arguments you're making. I'm going to assume that the question is with regards to terrorists and how they quote from the Quran and yet people say they are not good Muslims. In this case the issue raised is that, although they are able to quote portions of the Quran, they are completely ignoring the rest of what is said/ completely missing the context of the verses and they are also ignoring the example of the Prophet (pbuh), someone that we believe was the embodiment of what the Quran taught. Nothing in the Quran or sunnah (prophetic example) point towards treating people in an unfair and unjust manner. With regards to homosexuality, we believe that the act of homosexual intercourse is sinful, however it is the same as pre-marital sex or any other sins. There is no reason to treat anyone any differently. Everyone sins, and Islamically the treatment of a person does not differ depending on the sin.(i.e. you are gay therefore we hate you, but you only had sex before marriage so you should repent and stop, and you drank alcohol but lots of people do it so you should just try to stop etc. A sin is a sin, it is up to god to judge.)"

It's not just ""sinful,"" it's ""kufr,"" which means ""disbelief,"" and it makes you a non-Muslim.    Sorry if this is an ignorant question I'm just curious because I've met people of all religions that don't follow every thing their holy book tells them (e.g. The bible has parts saying that pre-marital sex is a sin yet still participate in it).

If you think you disagree with a part of the Qur'an, are you really disagreeing with Qur'an itself, or are you disagreeing with a certain interpretation of it? This comes up a lot more than you might think. The Qur'an itself says that some of its verses are literal and others are meant to be interpreted allegorically. See this verse:   Qur'an 3:7  He it is Who has sent down to thee the Book: In it are verses basic or fundamental (of established meaning); they are the foundation of the Book: others are allegorical. But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah.

Not that I think Islam is a bad religion, but as an agnostic I tend to consider religions to be good when they motivate people to do good things that benefit other humans.  I have great sympathy for Islam and Muslims, but I don't think saying ""they'll beg to be Muslims"" like it's a threat is a good thing."

Different schools of legal thought also specify different punishments, ranging from milder discretionary penalties (Hanafi school) to prescribed lashings or even death by stoning.  If the country followed a school of law that called for harsher, prescribed punishments, those punishments couldn't be carried out without either (a) the testimony of four reliable witnesses to the act, or (b) a confession given freely by the offenders. Effectively, then, the state wouldn't have much control over what people did in private, as long as those people didn't self-incriminate.  This is my own understanding, and I'm not an expert by any means."
islam,3e0ocq,Abu_Adderall,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:58:08 2015 UTC,"People here seem to be missing the point. A homosexual person would not be treated any differently to a heterosexual person.   If they are accused of committing a sin (i.e. having homosexual intercourse with another person) then legal proceedings would occur as per what /u/abu_adderall wrote. This is the same for if someone was accused of pre/extra-marital sex, theft, fraud, murder, assault, or any other crime or sin for that matter. The punishment if found guilty however would change depending on the crime. (also it is important to note that in Islam it is extremely difficult to successfully accuse someone of a crime/ sin)  However this is only in the case of someone being accused of doing something or committing a crime. As for normal day to day life, nothing would be different. Why should it be. The private thoughts and feelings of a person is not the concern of a government."

Or is it a few lashes? Not sure, there seems to be some disagreement on this.   Islam's position seems a bit oppressive. The fact that the same type of punishments apply for pre/extra-marital sex, or that it is classified along with murder, doesn't make it less disturbing. I think many of you agree that it is disturbing.  As for your comments that ""[a]s for normal day to day life, nothing would be different"", I highly doubt that homosexuals in Islamic countries would say that nothing is different.

Many people have said this and I agree, that the punishments for sins and crimes laid out in Islam are meant to act as deterrents against said sin or crime. Very Very rarely will a punishment actually be given for anything. And this is not an apologist's stance. We can look at the life of the Prophet (pbuh) to see how he dealt with punishments.

One of the major madhhabs doesn't require capital punishment for sodomy, and many scholars in the other madhhabs only prescribe death for a muhsan offender, following the hadd for zina (al-Munajjid even mentions this in his fatwa.)

For Christian to be a Muslim, he must not to believe that Jesus is God or son of God, believe in Qur'an and believe that Bible is not to be trusted in its entirety except when it matches with Qur'an.

We only certify truths attributed to the Prophets that are given in the Quran.   We believe Jesus(pbuh) will return defeat the Dajjal(anti-Christ) since that is the decree of Allah(swt).   Truthfully even if someone wanted to live his life according to what Jesus (pbuh) taught. There are many hurdles. Jesus(pbuh) was sent to the Jews and not all of humanity. So one would need to be a jew. Jesus(pbuh) teachings are virtually lost. If you read the red letter bible, you'll find how little of the bible is attributed to his own words. From the Islamic perspective only what Qur'an and Hadith attribute to Jesus(pbuh) is what the truth is. What exactly will one follow if he were to follow Jesus(pbuh) sharia. Not to mention the sharia for all of Mankind is given to us through Prophet Muhammad(pbuh).   By being Muslims we actually follow the command of the same person who commanded Muslims.

islam,3du0p2,Fargo7,0,Mon Jul 20 02:52:28 2015 UTC,"Did I say that? I asked you a question about your redefining of a well-known term.  Edit: And for the record, I don't. Muslims who live in the West do so under contract, explicit and implicit, in the gaining of visas or citizenship. Whether you're a born or naturalized citizen, these contracts explicitly demand adherence to local laws.  And even if it wasn't explicitly laid out, these actions have a net negative imposition on every other Muslim living in the region - and no extended benefit for Muslims internationally either as the end result is more money pumped into the war machine for further misguided adventures by our government abroad. The objective of a defensive war in Islam is to repel an invasion, not to invite more.  And these actions also don't accord with Islamic law where even for suriyah or out-right war, the individual participants are required to act under a commander.  And that's assuming that your nonsense of attributing a religious motive to this individual in Chatanooga is actually valid when we have no non-circumstantial evidence to believe it is."
islam,3du0p2,HulaguKan,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:58:27 2015 UTC,"Not that I am saying they are legitimate targets, to the contrary in this case, but marines = soldiers. By definition soldiers are targets. That is basically a major part of the job description."

A. They read how the USA hates and victimizes Muslims  B. They read a few verses implying that Muslim men should protect their families and fellow Muslims from harm.  Its not a far reach for them to assume if the USA is harming and victimizing Muslims like this form always says, that the young man may think the right thing to do is fight the USA.

So cut the crap with this ""Islamic terrorism is rare, we are a religion of peace,  dont look at us Muslims, we don't know where all this violence is coming from....."""

We love those who deserve to be loved, and hate those who deserve to be hated.    “Verily the strongest handhold of faith is that you love for the sake of Allah and that you hate for the sake of Allah.” [Ahmad 4/286]    “Whoever gives for Allah, the Most High, withholds for Allah, loves for Allah, hates for Allah, and marries for Allah has perfected his imaan.” [Ahmad 3/440, Tirmidhi 2521]    The Qadiani faith absolutely deserves to be hated.

islam,3dwz29,UntitledTales,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:14:54 2015 UTC,"Shaykh Ibn Baaz on Love and Hatred for the Sake of Allaah  Posted on November 19, 2012 by admin  In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Ever Merciful…  Allaah describes the true believers in Islaam with the following description:  ( وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَشَدُّ حُبًّا للهِ )  ( While the people of eemaan are stronger in their love for Allaah [than anyone else] ) [Soorah al-Baqarah: 165]  Love and hatred are opposites.  Since it is logically impossible to truly love something without hating what stands against it, Muslims both love and hate for the sake of Allaah.  The Messenger of Allaah (may Allaah raise his rank and grant him peace) guided us to this balance and moderation in our emotions when he said:  (( إِنَّ أَوْثَقَ عُرَى الإِيْمَانِ أَنْ تُحِبَّ فِي اللهِ وَتُبْغِضَ فِي اللهِ ))  “Verily the strongest handhold of faith is that you love for the sake of Allah and that you hate for the sake of Allah.” [Ahmad 4/286, authentic]  The great scholar, Shaykh ‘Abdul-’Azeez ibn Baaz (d.1420, may Allaah have Mercy on him) was asked about love and hatred for the sake of Allaah, and he replied:  Loving for Allaah is when you love (someone) for Allaah’s sake, the Blessed and Exalted, because you believe him to be a person of taqwaa (mindfulness of Allaah’s orders) and eemaan (upright beliefs, statements, and actions).  Because of these things you love such a person for the sake of Allaah.  You also hate for the sake of Allaah when you see a disobedient disbeliever.  You hate such a person for the sake of Allaah.  You also hate a disobedient person, even if he is a Muslim, based on the degree of his disobedience.  This is how a believer is – He allows his heart to react to both types of people, loving some of them for the sake of Allaah.  He loves the people of eemaan and taqwaa for the sake of Allaah, while he hates the people of disbelief, evil, and disobedience for Allaah’s sake, allowing his heart to interact with both kinds.  In the case when there is good and bad in a person, like a disobedient Muslim, then he loves him for his Islaam and hates him for his disobedience, combining both emotions of love and hatred for one person.  As for the people of eemaan and the people of upright Islaamic practice, then he (a true believer) loves them wholeheartedly.  Similarly, he hates the people of disbelief wholeheartedly.  But regarding someone who has both things (good and bad traits), a disobedient Muslim, he loves him based on the level of his eemaan and Islaam, while he hates him according to the level of his disobedience and violations (of Islaamic beliefs and practices).  Source: The shaykh’s answer to a question on the radio program, Noor ‘alad-Darb (click here for Arabic source).  Important note: With these necessary emotions, Muslims are required to maintain an important balance, and they are not allowed to transgress against the rights of those they hate.  Allaah says:  يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّامِينَ للهِ شُهَدَاءَ بِالقِسْطِ وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَئَانُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلَّا تَعْدِلُواْ اعْدِلُواْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى وَاتَّقُواْ اللهَ إِنَّ اللهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ  ( O you who believe!  Stand devoutly for Allah as witnesses of justice, and do not let your animosity for some people prevent you from being fair.  Be fair, as it is closer to piety, and observe your duty to Allah.

Facing an open and strong opposition by Muslim Scholars and religious leaders for this blasphemous declaration and other teachings which belittled Jesus Christ(pbuh) and contradicted the Quranic revelations, he also announced that he was the second and improved coming of the Prophet Muhammad(SAW) with authority to reinterpret the Holy Quran at his pleasure! Not happy with mere prophethood, in 1904, he declared himself the Krishna (the Hindu Lord). Obviously, like an unethical modern-day politician, he was trying to appeal to all uneducated segments of the public in India!    Commonly held beliefs of Qadianis:      Reject the concept of absolute Finality of Prophethood of Muhammad (saw) They believe that Mirza Ghulam Qadiani was a Prophet (nabi and rasul) of God  Believe that Jesus(pbuh) had been crucified, but did not die from his injuries. Instead he recovered from his injuries, escaped to Kashmir (India), where he lived for another 86 years, and is buried there They believe that the entire mankind, except for those who naively accept the irrational notions and contradictory claims of Mirza Ghulam Qadiani, to be unbelievers and bound for hell.

So we disagree with mainstream muslims on a few things, they say Jesus is still alive and gonna fly down in person one day and slaughter everyone, n pigs n etc... we believe the second coming was a spiritual duplicate in qualities as Jesus similar to how Jesus stated the second coming of Elijah was john the baptist.  Now because hes a new physical body people feel that violates khatum nabi which to them means the last prophet and we say it means the seal of the prophets.  we also believe that Jesus survived the crucifixion in order to complete his duty to spread his message to the lost tribes.   that being said , we believe in the kalima , 5 pillars n 6 articles of faith. all this can be proven but im not here to debate, im just answering why this subreddit sees us as heretics. you can discuss more at  /r/ahmadiyyat or pm me."

islam,3dz4xp,armbarthrowaway,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"When I now hear about ‘white guilt,’ ‘white privilege,’ and the historical burden white people in America must shoulder I can’t help but find it as ironic as it is ridiculous. It functions as a kind of secular doctrine of Original Sin wherein one’s physical appearance automatically renders one guilty of past crimes such as slavery and Jim Crow laws. This is not to deny at all that there are definite elements of racism that linger in America today, but such unjust biases exist everywhere and simply can’t be rooted in scapegoating entire groups of people based on physical appearance.   This is total bull shvt. I can tell by your writing you know nothing white supremacy; how it began and how it became the dominant social religious and political thought of Europeans. White privilege has nothing to do with appearance it has to do historically advantages built within society for a people of particular group  and oppressive laws and systems to keep all others out of power.  It's evident you never read any works by Frantz Fannon, Cornel West, Dr Ivan van Sertima, Carter G Woodson, John Henrik Clarke, Cheikh Anta Diop and others.  In short, white supremacy is a byword for white privilege in most spheres of social life in Western and Westernized societies.  It is best understood to operate on a continuum with mild forms of racism at one end leading to more severe types of racism at the other.  For instance, when people of color deal with everyday slights such as not being served properly at a department store, or being followed in the store by security officers, this can be deemed as “mild” forms of white supremacy in action. More “severe” forms can be associated with the Ku Klux Klan attacks on people of color or heavy-handed policing in African-American communities'  http://www.africanholocaust.net/html_ah/Notes%20on%20Understanding%20White%20Supremacy.html"

You're just ranting in an unsubstantiated manner.  By the way, I grew up reading Cornel West not to mention Richard Wright, James Baldwin, the poetry of Gwendolyn Brooks, etc.    My point is that generalizations, stereotypes fail on an individual level.  Lumping together all Muslims as potential terrorists is as foolish as lumping together all 'white people' as potentially racist.  Even if you wish to rally behind some kind of postmodern quasi-liberalism, such ideas are certainly not in keeping with the tenets of Islam."
islam,3dz4xp,American-Negro,3,Mon Jul 20 20:53:36 2015 UTC,I don't think you understand what white privilege is. Peggy McIntosh has a 50-point checklist of how white people benefit from the entrenchment of white supremacy and structural racism on a daily basis.  http://amptoons.com/blog/files/mcintosh.html  Literally every point out of 50 is something a person of color cannot do.

Where does it end?  I don't, for instance, deny injustices in America and elsewhere.  What I'm trying to suggest is that generalizations fail to hit the mark and actually lead to more ignorance."
islam,3dz4xp,American-Negro,3,Mon Jul 20 21:23:49 2015 UTC,"Of course it is Arab privilege.  Muslims have conversations about Arab privilege all the time. The Muslim Anti-Racist Collaborative host panels on it, and often posts about how we can make the ummah more inclusive to other ethnicities and non-brown converts.  http://www.muslimarc.org/  The Stream also hosted a panel where black Muslims discussed their frustrations with Arab privilege.  http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201402271936-0023510"

Such collusion and prejudice is everywhere.  I am trying to point out though that it's inherently unfair to lump groups of people together even Arabs and white Americans, so to speak.  That narrative falls apart when we are discussing individuals as I tried to say in the piece.  It's the same narrative that the likes of FOX News uses against Muslims and other minorities in America including blacks.  I don't think turning the tables solves the problem.  Instead, I believe it leads to further ignorance.  Again though, such generalizing goes against very tenets of Islam."

We are not saying all white people and Arabs are racist. There are just certain privileges with being white in a society literally built on white privilege, or being Arab in a religion founded and dictated by an Arab.

Of course and I don't disagree with that.     We are not saying all white people and Arabs are racist.    You may not be, but that is certainly not the narrative being followed elsewhere as the notion of 'white privilege' becomes a trending theme.     There are just certain privileges with being white in a society literally built on white privilege, or being Arab in a religion founded and dictated by an Arab.   What I'm trying to say is that notions of privilege are not the exclusive domain of 'white people' which seems to be the prevailing theme when 'white privilege' is brought up.   Almost always the ethnic majority may have some advantages, but that is human nature or rather human nature at the mercy of its lower callings.  Again faith, in this case Islam, seeks/sought to disallow such meritless inequities.  Notions of privilege are not exclusive to men or white people or whomever.  Context counts.  Pashtuns often have privilege over Hazaras in Afghanistan, Ottomans had privilege over their empire, etc.  For that matter, the very clothes we wear might offer privilege in many social contexts.  Also, I'm neither Libertarian nor Conservative, I'm just puzzled by the logic of such generalizations because as a Muslim and as a minority I know all too well how they fail to fully encompass who we are as human beings.     By the way, thank you for having an actual discussion and not resorting to name-calling or diatribes."

As a result you're conflating it with prejudice  and stereotyping ('You're Caucasian therefore you must be racist')  then extrapolating that notion onto Muslims then unto Islam.

However, much of what you've brought up is rooted in outlooks and philosophies I don't agree with.  For example, a big influence on theories of power is Foucault.  He's a brilliant man, but I don't find much value in his work, especially as a Muslim.  Also, there is a great deal of Marxist influence with current trends such as white privilege.  On paper some if it sounds reasonable, in practice it does not.  However, the Frankfurt school, though heavily Marxist, had remarkable things to say about consumer culture.

If God does not will for something to take place, it will not happen no matter how hard we try. And if He wills for something to occur, it will transpire no matter what we do to stop it. One may say then, “What’s the use of striving in this life if we will get what is already decreed by God?”  This seems logical, but it is, of course, a misconception. In fact, Islam places great emphasis on making efforts towards a desired end. In the Quran, God says, “And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives And that his effort is going to be seen – Then he will be recompensed for it with the fullest recompense And that to your Lord is the finality”(53:39-42).

islam,3dxa0r,autumnflower,3,Tue Jul 21 02:07:17 2015 UTC,"Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or be he ungrateful. 76:3  And [by] the soul and He who proportioned it  And inspired it [with discernment of] its wickedness and its righteousness,  He has succeeded who purifies it,  And he has failed who instills it [with corruption]. 98:7-10   Allah (swt) guides who he wills based on whether the person wants to be guided or not. So if someone in their hearts wants the truth and guidance, then Allah (swt) will guide them along that path and make it easy for them, and this is where dawah to Islam comes in. One's job becomes to show those looking for the truth what it is.  If someone on the other rejects the truth and Allah (swt), then He will make his path of misguidance easy and let them go further into it. After they insist on rejecting truth, that process of rejection and stubbornness will make their heart will become hard and veiled.   As the Qur'an indicates, one has free will in choosing whether to purify their heart and soul or to corrupt it, and based on the choice, they will be guided further and further along the path they chose.  This does not mean that you can look at people and decide, this one's misguided/bad heart, that one's guided/good heart. Only Allah (swt) knows what is in their heart. Many are simply stumbling around but may eventually find the truth and have Allah (swt) guide them towards it.   why me, why did I choose to revert now and not before or later   Did you not want truth? Allah (swt) guided you to it.   Don't your life experiences offer you a perspective and deeper insight with which to view the world. Perhaps reverting at this point in time gave you the chance to withstand turmoil and have a firmer and deeper belief. I don't know, but I'm sure if you contemplate, you can see good things in your life that led you to this point.  Do not assume to know if others are good or bad and why they haven't found Islam. You don't know if they will come to it later, and you don't know what is in their hearts. Allah (swt) will not wrong anyone as He is the most just."

When someone beats a rug with a stick, he is not beating the rug—his aim is to get rid of the dust.  Your inward is full of dust from the veil of I-ness, and that dust will not leave all at once.  With every cruelty and every blow, it departs little by little from the heart's face, sometimes in sleep and sometimes in wakefulness.    It comes from Mawlana Rumi's Diwan. The translator, William Chittick, gives the following explanation:   Heartache (ghamm) and the cruelty (jafa') inflicted by the Beloved make way for joy (shadi, surur) and His faithfulness (wafa'). Trials and tribulations are all necessary stages of purification, through which man is delivered from attachment to himself and the world.... The only way to flee from suffering is to seek refuge from one's own ego with God. But having chosen God, man has also chosen to accept with equanimity whatever He wishes to give. Any other course of action shows that he is still attached to self.    (Chittick, The Sufi Path of Love, p. 238.)"

I need advice on how to handle this situation; How can I support my SO? What is the best way to resolve this peacefully or is that even an option? (They will not be reasoned with)   You getting involved will worsen the problem. They ignored her, why should they listen to you? Unless you have something that they like, you will be simply ignored and used as an ammo for whatever arguments that may happen in the future.  There isn't good way to solve this problem. Ultimately, she will have to choose you or her family.  Since you posted this on /r/islam, I assume you're also looking for an advice from Islamic point of view.  The advice for her is to break up with you and distance herself from the family. She should seek for a potential Muslim spouse. If she doesn't get married by time her family thinks she should be married, they will get husband for her. Forced marriage is very very rare but I'm not ruling it out as a possibility.  If she marries with a Muslim spouse (by her choice), it will give her a breathing room she needs to start learning the religion in the same way as Allah had revealed it to us."

Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women because Islam orders Muslim men to allow their wives freedom of religion.
islam,3dzgft,trojan_paris,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:10 2015 UTC,So Islam assumes men have control of the relationship then?
islam,3dzgft,Theoroshia,2,Tue Jul 21 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"What do you mean when you say 'men have control of the relationship'? Men are disproportionately the breadwinners of households, and on average stronger than women. But this does not mean a man controls the relationship anymore than a woman controls the relationship. The fear is that the man may leverage his ability to support the family into forcing the woman to comply to his demands. The prohibition on Muslim women from marrying non-Muslim men helps to prevent such a situation where the man gains control over the woman to the point that he forces her to change her faith. It should also be noted that any children born from a marriage of a Muslim woman and non-Muslim man are at risk of being abused and forced into a faith by the husband as well."

islam,3dzgft,AtomicKoala,3,Tue Jul 21 18:29:50 2015 UTC,"Everything you just described is steeped in culture, not religion. You won't find the answers you want here. The honest Islamic approach is that you have to end this relationship. Dating is forbidden and marriage between a Muslim woman to a non Muslim is also forbidden. That will fix this one issue with her religion, and prevent any future issues with her family. As for the other things you mentioned, those cultural roots run deep. I believe only new generations can change those."

If she marries a Christian it is not guaranteed that the Christian will allow her to keep her faith. If you convert, I imagine almost all the problems her parents would have with you will dissipate. I should also mention that in desi culture, usually the family plays matchmaker to find a spouse for their child. So convert, meet with her family, become friends with them, then ask for her hand in marriage and all will be right."

No. If the reasons of converting are not genuine (i.e. not genuinely believing in Allah), then the conversion is invalid.   If you convert, I imagine almost all the problems her parents would have with you will dissipate.   It's highly likely that her family wants to her to marry a desi man.

islam,3dzgft,Dunyaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:16 2015 UTC,"Since your posts are not showing up, I'll answer some of your questions from your profile page:   Sorry, but saying the cause is Islam, I meant that the family behave as they do in the name of Islam.   I see, but it's better to point fingers towards the issue in the correct direction least you can solve the problem at its root cause. We get too much flack nowadays.   I certainly did not intend to get involved, I simply want to support her. Your response is quite a depressing truth, as an outsider to the faith I struggle to understand the issue with affiliating with non muslims? Could you perhaps explain why she should break up with me? We are very happy together.   I'm saying it so you or others in the same situation don't attempt that would strain the relationship between her and her family even more.  According to Islam it's not possible for a Muslim to be in relationship with non-Muslim for many reasons. I suggest you search posts in this subreddit to find out reasons why.  Please note this is Islamic advice. This is her obligation to do this as part of her religion. If she values her religion, she would have done this a long time ago.   If I did break up with her, does Islam still condone a family atmosphere which is so constricting she must consult a councillor to deal with the stresses of this?    Not at all. This is why I suggested that she distances herself from the family.  The advice of her leaving you and distancing herself from the family still stands. Sure you both will get hurt but ultimately in a long term it's going to get better both of you. No longer will you worry about this mess and no longer will she worry about the family and husband especially if she finds one herself."

The commentaries on the fiqh texts do clarify that if the person in question knows how to pray properly, the ruling does not apply.  Overall, it seems like a very silly thing to single out and it is. It's reflective of the culture in which the books were written. Something that people need to keep in mind when reading classical texts is that every person is shaped by their time and culture. By romanticizing our classical tradition and thinking that it was some utopia, we set ourselves up for disappointment when we finally realize that they were human and just as prone to faults and biases as us.

In such cases, the child may be attributed to the man who had intercourse with the woman, and they may inherit from one another. But if it was a case of zina then the child cannot be attributed to the zaani. Based on that, he cannot inherit from him. End quote."

As for outside the West, from my non-Western Salafi-scholar influenced POV it's mostly due to the so called hizbee clerics (political Islamists).   One has to only go and see their political activism on social media to know that they have a large amount of followers compared to the non hizbee (political) Salafi scholars. They are very active and powerful, they gained popularity with the unsuspecting masses mostly by mixing truth with falsehood (politics). It also helps that they have the gift of good speech. This is usually done by way of stirring up their followers' emotions they bring up some social justice issues, or guilt the youth into going to conflict areas (e.g Syria/Iraq). Yet somehow you never see them send their own sons/daughters there. They live a happy conflict-free life and their kids enjoy their western education payed by the very governments they are inciting the people against.

islam,3du9ny,shimmerstrike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the references.  I'll have to take a look soon, insha'Allah.  Regarding your response to my question, religious speaking, I think at least theoretically there is a place for political Islam.  But I've been dissatisfied with every model of it (or attempt at it) that we've seen in contemporary and even past times.  Nor can I pretend to have any of the right answers (I can't say ""they're doing it wrong because of X, if it were up to me, I'd do it right because I'd go with Y"").  Just to be clear (although my posting history would point toward this), I'm a Shi'a Muslim, but I think political realities which lead to bloodshed, instability, loss of life, etc. exist within both political Sunni Islam and political Shi'a Islam.  How widespread do you think hizbee vs. non-hizbee thinking is within the Salafi movement(s)?  It would be hard for me to quantify within Shi'a Islam, but I've slowly come to believe that the hizbee mindset is at least present in a large minority of Shi'a Muslims, and quite possibly in the majority.  And maybe from your point of view, all Shi'a Muslims are hizbee (I'm not sure), but I'm classifying Shi'a attitudes under the assumption that for a devout Shi'a Muslim (such as myself), the Qur'an and Sunnah are the sources of Islamic knowledge, just as they are for devout Sunni Muslims.  The differences is that a different methodology of hadith science is used to determine and understand the Sunnah, and similarly, there are differences in the interpretation of Qur'an."

This report only supports what the actual authorities on Islam said way before MI5, by giving us diligently acquired scholarly evidence from:  1.The Qur'an  2.The Sunnah  3.The unanimous agreement of scholars of Ahl as-Sunnah wa al-Jamaa'ah (Salafi scholars)  They reinforced our religious identity, they taught us what the rules of jihad are and what's the role of a muslim citizen in muslim or non-muslim countries. They taught us to honour treaties (such as for e.g. visa, citizenship, greencard) and how it's not the way of the prophet ﷺ to betray a treaty.    What's up with ISIS? Is it a branch of Salafiyyah? What do the scholars of Salafiyyah say about the Khawarij? Why should we listen to the scholars of Salafiyya who call against jihad, & suicide bombings?   That is more authority than an MI5 report."

islam,3dw21h,Alkahf,8,Mon Jul 20 07:35:47 2015 UTC,I think Yajuj and Majuj are not the names of individuals. These are name of two tribes with many people in each of them.

One of them is Sheikh Imran Hosein. He has written books on this subject.  http://www.imranhosein.org/books/131-an-islamic-view-of-gog-and-magog-in-the-modern-age.html  Please take note that he mentions many times that his interpretation may be wrong as he is just a human being who can't predict the future.

Moon visibility charts didn't say that was scientifically impossible to spot it in SD, just that the visibility was low and one would need an optical aid. Sooo..."

islam,3dv995,gjklmf,4,Sun Jul 19 23:08:56 2015 UTC,"Those charts show visibility according the Danjon limit, which states that the probability of the moon's visibility below 7° is low. It is a probabilistic, historical measure and not a definitive, rule-based one. Besides, its only 70 years old.   The Danjon limit has been shown to be a rule of thumb and not as Sh.

islam,3dv995,maghfira,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"The point about it being 70 years old is to say that it is not ""traditional,"" if you are trying to use tradition as a proof for why the sighting was impossible.  Second, the Danjon limit is contested (by  astronomers, mathematicians, and engineers) and has been shown to not be consistent and depends on contrast, elevation, and other atmospheric conditions. So it was never considered definitive and ""scientifically conclusive"" even by the same  astronomers, mathematicians, and engineers you refer to.

islam,3dv995,JoeBradford,6,Tue Jul 21 18:32:17 2015 UTC,But moon sighting must be confirmed by naked eye sighting which there was none as it was scientifically impossible to see a visible moon without an aid.
islam,3dv995,The_Hermione_Granger,8,Sun Jul 19 21:19:26 2015 UTC,"Not even getting into that, bro. With all due respect to Sh. Hamza, it's poor wording to write 1. that the moon was impossible to sight at all and 2. that a small group of people spotting the moon isn't enough (when it's the classical position of the majority of madahab that a single sighting is enough for the global ummah to fast)."

I dont wear either of those and usually keep my scarf in check when I do pray, but does anyone know more about this issue? Just curious."
islam,3dsofd,forgotmypwnofap,14,Sun Jul 19 02:09:26 2015 UTC,"it is impermissible for women to pray with a cloth between their face and the prayer rug   Gonna give it a thought because no one answered. First off doesn't make much sense....The Prophet (saws) and the companions use to pray on the raw earth, there were no carpets back on those time like we have today. So a ruling about cloth between face and prayer rug doesn't make much sense....Also doesn't make sense because whats the difference between the carpet and the cloth of niqab or hijab? Nothing, the carpet is not holy in any way.   Like if the floor was dirty, and the person had an extra hijab, they could use that extra hijab as a carpet to pray on.   Hope that helped. Salam."

islam,3dtspi,AnotherParaclete,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"those are not salafis, those are haddadis.   The Haddadiyyah: This deviant, misguided group began by an individual by the name Mahmoud Haddad. Their manifestation is in ghuloo (going over board) in attacking the people of the Sunnah. Haddad tried to compare those who made mistakes from the Imams of the Sunnah like Haafidh ibn Hajr and Imam an-Nawawee to the ignorant misguided innovators and free thinkers who did no service for Islaam whatsoever, such as Sayyid Qutub and Abu ‘Abdul Alaa Mawdoodee. They went as far as saying that one has to burn the books of Ibn Hajar and Nawawee. The scholars of Ahlus Sunnah were aware of the plot of the Hadadis and refuted them and their dangerous methodology. Their methodology was only another cunning way to try to protect the people of innovation by saying, “if you must refute Qutub, Banna, and their likes, you must not give excuses to the likes of Ibn Hajar and Nawawee”.  No doubt, the mistakes of the scholars who aided and defended the Sunnah but fell short are refuted and clarified, but in no way are they compared to those who were not scholars at all such as Qutub, Banna, and Mawdoodee, as their works only added to fitnah and chaos in Islaam. Haddad wrote thick volumes in criticism of Shaykh al-Albaani رحمه الله, but never penned a word against the deviations of the likes of Sayyid Qutub and his book filled with innovations “In the Shade of the Qur’an.” This made it clear that Haddad and his group only intended by this to wage war against the carriers of the Sunnah. Haddadiyyah took other turns over the years; in the early 2000’s the ghuloo of Falih al Harbee became apparent by him refuting innovation and the people of innovation, and at the same time attacking people well known to be upon the Sunnah but not willing to present any proof for that, claiming this way to be the true manhaj of the Salaf.  Many scholars of the Sunnah were not safe from his tongue and he became a reason for much chaos amongst the Salafi youth. The Mujaahid, Shaykh Rabee’ may Allaah preserve him, after advising Falih for a number of years, requesting that he stop treading this destructive path, refuted Falih al Harbee and his corrupt principles and put an end to his manhaj of ghuloo. From those who went astray by defending Falih and his new methodology was Fawzee al-Atharee from Bahrain amongst others. From the late 2000’s up until now (2013) we see the manifestations of this ghuloo in the likes of Yahyaa al-Hajooree who was a student of Shaykh Muqbil but changed after the death of the Shaykh. He began to wage war against well-known scholars and defenders of the Salafi methodology and accused them of hizbiyyah without having any proof. He let his students in Dammaj, Yemen go to the extremes regarding him with overboard statements and actions, some which carried Shirk. He went further and further into destruction, until the point that he claimed that the first adhaan on Jumah by the third rightly guided khalifa Uthmaan ibn Affan رضي الله عنه‎ was an innovation. After being advised by many scholars and Yahyaa continuing his attacks upon the people of the Sunnah, the scholars declared him and his followers to be upon innovation.   source: http://www.tawheedfirst.com/o-muslim-be-cautious-from-whom-you-take-your-religion/  Bilal Philips have fallen into great errors, so have Yasir Qadhi, may Allah guide them, but don't put those who warn against these two with those who warn against an-Nawawi  Bilal Philips: http://ahlulbidahwalhawa.com/2012/03/14/errors-in-usool-of-bilal-philips/  http://www.abukhadeejah.com/bilal-philips-the-deceitful-defender-of-ahlul-bidah/  Yasir Qadhi:  http://ahlulbidahwalhawa.com/category/criticised-individuals/yasir-qadhi/"

islam,3drs0j,LittleMiss_ScareAll,6,Sun Jul 19 03:28:41 2015 UTC,"that does not make him the greatest scholar of all time. That just makes him A scholar of islam. Every scholar works towards reviving the quran and sunnah among the people he/she lives in.   Also, no, his funeral was not even close to being the biggest. He had upwards of a few hundred thousand people attend his funeral. I can find a lot more people in Islam who have had exponentially higher number of people turn up at their funeral. # of people at a funereal means absolutely nothing."
islam,3drs0j,Olasyar,-4,Sun Jul 19 03:31:50 2015 UTC,"What's more is this subs hypocricy towards muslims killing shia.   So you mean to tell me that /r/Islam supports the killing of Shias?   If one of their own dies go a non Muslim they're mourning day ans night, yet we get news of 1000s of shias dying every week and no one cares.   Just say the word and we will start mourning for them day and night as well. I feel sorry for you if you base your self worth on a bunch of votes and comments. You say these things as if Sunnis are fighting Shias exclusively. Sunni Muslims have borne the brunt of extremist attacks. Who are fighting the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan? Pakistan has lost close to 7000 soldiers and counting, a majority of them Sunnis, to the war on terror. From 2003-2015 Pakistan has lost approximately 58000 (civilians and army) people to terrorism. You are mistaken if you think they were all Shias."

We all come to /r/Islam for various reasons. Regardless of what they may be, noone likes to feel outcasted, considered less than, not as important, and more serious things like having to deal with someone declaring takfir against you.   The Shi'a are very much in the right to be paranoid about this sub because of these things. Lots of posts get ignored, but lots of posts  from or about Shi'a are especially ignored. And when they aren't ignored there is more chance of there being a huge debate rather than focusing on the original topic, like in this thread.  What is the least we could do if we were to comment here?  Inna illahi wa inna illahyi raji'oon.  That's it. That's all this thread would need. But then someone has to comment like the deleted post above, and it only affirms to the Shi'a that maybe there is hypocrisy in this sub towards them. It's hard to see past the negatives once you experience it so much from the same place over and over again.  May Allah protect us all from such evils in this dunya and grant us better understanding and lead us all to work towards a better acceptance of each other as brothers and sisters in faith. May Allah accept these innocents as shaheed and grant them Jannah Firdous. Ameen."

I think it does because you are looking for acceptance from Sunnis on things which they have no control over. People who have no idea of the differences between Sunni and Shia theologies love to throw around the one ummah concept. Shias and Sunnis differ widely on many things and it is foolish to deny them. We are an ummah for the sake of Allah (swt). Even if there is one person on the path of tawhid he is still considered to be an ummah.

B) Israel and the Palestinians obviously have challenges, but I live in the United States, and I don't think Jews really have any conflicts with Muslims in the United States.   C) From my perspective, the only fundamental conflicts between Judaism and Islam come from the fact that Mohammad had some bad encounters with Jews early on, and that many Muslims seem to be more literal about how they observe the Koran than most American Jews are about observing the Torah.   From my perspective, Judaism and Islam are just western and eastern versions of the same religion. I'm just the Kaypro version of a Muslim. If I had a magic wand, I'd solve most of the Israel/Palestine Law of Return problem by acknowledging that Muslims are really Jews who happen to follow the Koran.   And I know, that, of course, there are differences, but, if you're open to the idea that people at least filtered the Koran and Torah through human consciousness, it seems as if the stuff I would care about if I were a truly good deity, and not a Star Trek Q, is identical in both religions: be modest, honest, merciful, sober, just, charitable and kind to animals."

Would people find it offensive if I am not bowing, etc, when they do?   Probably not, maybe just talk to the imam beforehand and tell him you're new and want to observe.

I have made my seven circuits around the Ka'ba, led by a young Mutawaf named Muhammad. I drank water from the well of the Zam Zam. I ran seven times back and forth between the hills of Mt. Al-Safa and Al-Marwah. I have prayed in the ancient city of Mina, and I have prayed on Mt. Arafat.  There were tens of thousands of pilgrims, from all over the world. They were of all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans. But we were all participating in the same ritual, displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe never could exist between the white and non-white.  America needs to understand Islam, because this is the one religion that erases from its society the race problem. Throughout my travels in the Muslim world, I have met, talked to, and even eaten with people who in America would have been considered 'white'--but the 'white' attitude was removed from their minds by the religion of Islam. I have never before seen sincere and true brotherhood practiced by all colors together, irrespective of their color.   Letter from Mecca , Malcolm X  April, 1964"

In Islam specifically, it does not have any bearing whatsoever.  However Islam is a religion. ""Muslims"", on the other hand, are those who attempt to adhere to it---as best they can. These imperfect Muslims live in this world, and sometimes they've been subjugated to colonization (some desis, some africans, etc), to subjugation (some palestinians, some chinese, some burmese, etc.) or perhaps they themselves feel racially superior to others (some arabs, etc.). Any of these three extremes can easily lead to some sentiments racism either through inferiority or superiority complexes.  At the end of the day though, Muslims are people just like everyone else. Almost anywhere you go in this world, white people are generally looked up to, even if that feeling isn't verbalized. It's the same with Muslims. Maybe even more so, particularly in the West, since there's so few identifiably white Muslims over here."

My dad, who doesnt even look stereotypically muslim(unlike me who looks very stereotypical) is randomly searched at airports EVERYTIME. to me it became less a matter of religiion and more a matter of race.

islam,3dsro1,Elijahquestions,4,Sun Jul 19 03:05:15 2015 UTC,"No. Is that seriously all you took from those threads? That is Qadhi likes to demonstrate the Evolution of men, but even he has stated that there are many, many different perspectives, and that this one is the easiest for a him to get s Muslim to comprehend and accept.   How I see it is just like anything else in this world, we must realise that nothing happens without Gods will, and that everything is predestined — a currently accepted fact of Science, if you have all of the information about the state of the universe at any given time, you can predict all that has and will ever happen, now there are some people whom state that this isn't the Truth, do to Quantum Mechanics, but for the most part, MOST physicists still do think the universe is this way, and even if it weren't, we can't test otherwise. Islam goes a step further and states that there is an eternal presence that has determined what'll happen, instead of a random beginning, God determined everything that would ever be and through his process of the Creation of the universe(be it a big bang, or whatever), and processes of nuclear reactions, gravity, etc, He made the universe what it is today, Evolution is just the process God used to make His Creatures, and if you understood Evolution, you'd understand that it is really no different from gravity, it doesn't work on any magical principles, just simple mutations in the biology of each Creature, and natural selection, that's it! Don't overcomplicate it! I am so tired of all the misconceptions, either non Muslims thinking that all Muslims are irrational Creationists who think God is sitting on a cloud sculpting His Creatures one by one out of plado, or Muslims thinking Evolution is this complicated conspiracy with no evidence. No! It really isn't, and if you don't have the time, or you just don't want to open your mind up and look at what we know, then fine, that's your right, but don't you dare spread misinformation. There is a Sahih Hadith which states that you shouldn't speak about what you don't know, so please I beg you for your sake and the sake of those wanting to learn, just keep your mouth closed, and your eyes open, and learn, or better yet, open your mouth and ask questions, and listen to the answers, Truly listen to what is being said, and even if you can't hear the rational in what is being said, then ask them respectfully, at least politely, to elaborate or explain it in another way. I promise you most of the people knowledgeable on it who you ask would love to help you learn. And some people will speak out of ignorance, you know, it goes both ways, people repeat what they have heard, they don't always verify, or maybe they misunderstand something, so point out things you don't understand or think are sort of sketchy, because I promise you there is nothing sketchy in Science if you Truly understand it, and for a theory like Evolution, which is just so simple, there is nothing sketchy about it, I'd say it is much easier to fully understand than even gravity. And OP this wasn't meant just for you, its meant for all of those that seem to post in these threads every time this question comes up, and it comes up a lot, and although the knowledgeable try their best to keep the misinformation at bay, sometimes people are relentless with their statements which are always based on some misunderstanding, ignorance, or repeating what they heard someone else say."

(http://www.ips-planetarium.org/?age)  Other parts of the Quran say the earth and heavens were together and then split apart (http://quran.com/21/30) or that they were apart and brought together (http://quran.com/41/11) both of which contradict the big bang since it says the earth didn't exist at the time of the big bang.

islam,3ds385,guinness88,5,Sat Jul 18 23:59:33 2015 UTC,Indeed. I have changed my views about Muslims who are of the Salafiyyah movement. /r/Islam has changed me for the better.
islam,3ds385,Shizzin,15,Sun Jul 19 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"From the leaflet linked:   Muslim governments over centuries have encountered these types of rebellious movements known in Islamic terminology as Kharijites. Along with the Shiites (embodied in the modern-day Iranian regime), these Kharijites have never recognized any legitimacy except their own. Their goal being to seize power and to establish a regime of merciless brutality, in the name of ""justice""!   So tell me, when you publish a statement saying that shiites like the kharijites aim to establish merciless brutality, what exactly is the expectation here? Is it that such a statement will magically engender sudden tolerance in the hearts of the radicalized, or is the goal to combine the hypocrisy of proclaiming innocence from the type of hateful generalizations spouted by the likes of ISIS, while at the same time spouting the same hateful generalizations.  When the only difference between a person and the guy next to him is that one of them holds back impulses of violence while condoning and spouting hate, while the other makes no compulsion to hold back his violent impulses while feeling and spouting the exact same hate, there's a problem with both of them.   However, what they do is to draw lines (IMO too many) where crossing them = non-Muslim.    Are we splitting hairs here? Declaring someone as non-Muslim is the definition of takfir.    This results in salafis disliking two groups: Shia and sufi.   ""disliking""... Understatement of the century. Let's call it like it is: they hate shias. You just need to stroll on to any mildly salafi website to read the venom with which the rafidah are spoken of: accusations of being zanadiqa, deceivers, liars, shirk, etc. I would quote/link some stuff for you, but it's Eid and I'm not in the mood to read that kind of language.   There are many arguments in favour and against of Salafism however terrorism is not one of them.    There's nothing wrong with Salafism as an idea of returning to the Qur'an and hadith. There's a problem with the way they talk about other muslims, both shias and sunnis. It's not merely an intellectual disagreement, and can't say I recommend it, but just visit any salafi page of your choice and just see the kind of language used to describe the shias.  Terrorism does not grow in a vacuum. A person does not wake up one day and decide to go blow up people. A long process of dehumanization of the ""other"" needs to happen first. First, there's a need for absolute self-righteousness, I am right and everyone else is wrong. Then those ""others"" need to be declared non-muslim because in  Islam you can't kill muslims. Then they need to be fed hatred against them. If you feed enough irresponsible hate speech into people, then just sit back and wait for the rash, young, and confused to no longer be able to tell which authority is legitimate as they both spout the same hate, but one of them actually follows through on the hate."

islam,3ds385,recipriversexcluson,-4,Sun Jul 19 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"So tell me, when you publish a statement saying that shiites like the kharijites aim to establish merciless brutality, what exactly is the expectation here? Is it that such a statement will magically engender sudden tolerance in the hearts of the radicalized, or is the goal to combine the hypocrisy of proclaiming innocence from the type of hateful generalizations spouted by the likes of ISIS, while at the same time spouting the same hateful generalizations.  When the only difference between a person and the guy next to him is that one of them holds back impulses of violence while condoning and spouting hate, while the other makes no compulsion to hold back his violent impulses while feeling and spouting the exact same hate, there's a problem with both of them.   Read the leaflet again, this refers to Iranian regime.  Also, this does not advocate hate or anything like that.    Are we splitting hairs here? Declaring someone as non-Muslim is the definition of takfir.    No, I'm saying that instead of declaring a group non-Muslim, they declare particular actions to be taking-out-of-the-fold action.  This is very subtle difference but it changes drastically as to how they behave. This means they can't declare anyone non-Muslim to further their political/emotional agenda. Also, this is the same process used by the rest.  Following your logic, the one who declares an atheist who merely calls him/herself a Muslim just for laughs non-Muslim, is a takifiri.   ""disliking""... Understatement of the century. Let's call it like it is: they hate shias. You just need to stroll on to any mildly salafi website to read the venom with which the rafidah are spoken of: accusations of being zanadiqa, deceivers, liars, shirk, etc. I would quote/link some stuff for you, but it's Eid and I'm not in the mood to read that kind of language.   Eid is over today, care to source some of it? This was not experience I had with many of salafis. When asked, all they said was that they were innovators, that's it.   Terrorism does not grow in a vacuum. A person does not wake up one day and decide to go blow up people. A long process of dehumanization of the ""other"" needs to happen first. First, there's a need for absolute self-righteousness, I am right and everyone else is wrong. Then those ""others"" need to be declared non-muslim because in Islam you can't kill muslims. Then they need to be fed hatred against them. If you feed enough irresponsible hate speech into people, then just sit back and wait for the rash, young, and confused to no longer be able to tell which authority is legitimate as they both spout the same hate, but one of them actually follows through on the hate.   Salafis are taught to disassociate/avoid from the people who are practising bid'ah and anything that's getting close to shirk, not hate. This has some merits in Qur'an and hadith.  In fact the way you typed this statement reveals you do not know much about salafiyyah. I urge you go and meet some people who follow this ideology and especially also imams.  Do you not see the double standards in your statement? Non-Muslim would have very easily said the same thing about Islam. In fact this statement almost reads like it was posted by a user in /r/worldnews ""critiquing"" Islam. This is not to say that your statement is true and this is how radicalisation process works but it does not apply to salafiyyah movement."

islam,3ds385,possumpersi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:01:06 2015 UTC,"In Malaysia, most states officially adhere to Shafie fiqh- their state muftis are all Shafie, some more Ashairah than others. Only in the state of Perlis that their state mazhab is Ahlussunnah , incorporating the wide range of scholarly opinions within all mazahib of Ahlussunnah.    In Perlis the fatwa is produced by looking through:   Al-Qur'an Hadeeth ( sahih) Ijma' Sahabah ( consensus of the Companions) Fatwa Sahabah Hadeeth ( mursal and dhaif) Qiyas ( during dharurah) Masoleh al-Mursalah  Sadd az-Zara'ii Istihsan 'Uruf  Qawa'id al-Fiqhiyah   I found that pretty reasonable and I found the muftis they have so far are pretty reasonable too.   Yet due to their practice of not reciting Qunut in Fajr prayer, no talkin during burial, no jahr bismillah in al-Fatihah, as well as their Aqidah which do not follow the Ashairah/Maturidiah creed, some of the local scholars really abhor them, calling them Mujassimah and Wahhabi."

Wahhabis are intolerant, repressive of women, politically aligned with oppressers, and they are funding some of the worst atrocities against Muslims and non-Muslims overall.   As long as Salafis stay out of my and other people's Sufi-Shia blended Sunni practice of Islam, I am fine with them. It's when they get on about who is or is not Muslim that I get annoyed with them. Wahhabis have way too much money and political clout, and Muslims around the world need to combat their influence."

islam,3ds385,possumpersi,4,Sun Jul 19 05:36:35 2015 UTC,"""I consider Salafis too much of fundamentalists"".  The definition of 'fundamentalist' is those whom hold to fundaments. This is about Islam. Therefore, the fundaments of Islam. Therefore the statement would be interpreted ""I consider Salafis too much of Islamic fundamentalists"" or ""Salafis hold too much to Islamic fundaments"" What do you mean?

islam,3dsykf,FXOjafar,6,Sun Jul 19 18:14:40 2015 UTC,Surely voting for a candidate that is going to represent your views and is friendly to Islam is far more important than abstaining and ending up with right wing hate mongers in power.
islam,3dsykf,wwahwah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:15:00 2015 UTC,"The argument isn't about voting per se, but it's in regards to voting/partaking in a capitalist democratic system/election. When you vote for someone, you're voting them into a position where they have power to legislate rules other than those decreed by Allah (swt) through the Quran and Sunnah. So while Abu Bakr (and Ali?) were 'democratically' voted into the position of Khaleef, they were voted into a position where they would rule by the Law of Allah, and would not be making their own system.  One of the names of Allah is al-Hakim, ie The Legislator, so it can be argued that voting someone in who will legislate over the law of Allah is not permissible.  Furthermore, Allah says in Surat al-An'am: (al Hukm [ruling] is only for Allah). Hence, it is said by the scholars that the right to legislate law is for Allah and Allah alone, and no one else can decree what is 'halal' and 'haram' (which is what happens in a modern day democracy)  There are plenty more proofs along the same lines which I can dig up for you if you're interested. Essentially, the crux of the matter is that the right to rule is for Allah alone, and so voting in someone to make their own rules is haram."
islam,3dsykf,sword_and_shield,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:18:01 2015 UTC,"See, this is what I mean when I saw that you dont' know a lot about how elections really work. By simply the virtue of being in a non-muslim country, you are already in elections, whether you like it or not. It is better if you vote for someone who represents Islamic values versus those who want to kick all Muslims out (As is the case in these upcoming elections).   I can give you a breakdown of how simple democracy works if you like me to so that you understand better."
islam,3dsykf,sword_and_shield,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:44:23 2015 UTC,Why are you responding so arrogantly to him?
islam,3dsykf,sword_and_shield,2,Sun Jul 19 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"For one simple reason. Being narrow-minded and assuming that voting is haram. You are already in a non-muslim country, and hence you are already voting, so the notion that voting is haram is completely illogical."
islam,3dsykf,wwahwah,2,Sun Jul 19 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"The only narrow-minded person I see here is you. You basically made a submission to lure out your Muslim brothers who have a legit point of difference with you. After that you call them out for being stupid and narrow-minded.   In your initial post you mentioned that you have heard from 40 or so unnamed scholars that voting is halal (and perhaps even obligatory?). How does that bring any fruit to the debate? Perhaps they were all the same methodology? Am I more correct if I bring 41 scholars who have studied for a longer time, are more well known and acknowledged?   Then you bring an argument that because they are in a non Muslim country they're supposedly already in  elections. How is that a correct way you to determine what is haram and halal? If I already work in a brewery then alcohol consumption just doesn't become permissible because of that. I also reject your claim that living in a non Muslim country automatically makes you part of democracy.   Bottom line is: regardless of who is right or wrong, you have no right to insult your brother just because he differs with you. I think you just made this post to shame them out instead of wanting to guide them to that which is better (and it may be that your opinion is gravely wrong). If that wasn't your intention then I'm sorry to inform you that you have failed with the original intent."
islam,3dsykf,Darkpursuer,4,Sun Jul 19 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"It seems you still don't understand why I think those say voting is haram are completely ignorant of the election process. By simply virtue of living in a non-muslim country, you are voting.  Let me simplify this for you so that you can understand.    Imagine that 6 people were to vote for two parties named A and B. A states in his manifesto that he will legalise pornography, ban faith-schools, kill 1000 Muslims, and prevent Muslims from adorning the hijāb. B states that he will legalise pornography but allow faith schools and kill 500 Muslims. 3 of us vote for A and 2 votes for B and I, in believing that voting is kufr, abstain from doing so. What will happen?  Inevitably, A will win, but if I vote for B, then no one will. So by participating I lessen the evil. Let us now say that we have 2 more people, either they vote for B or abstain. Abstention will not change the situation while encouraging them to vote for B, who will do all these filthy things, will mean that A will lose which means that we saved the lives of 500 Muslims and had a chance to have faith schools and practice hijāb! So whether we vote or not, we actually vote since we are part of the population. This is how the system works, at least in Britain. If someone disagrees with this then they should provide proof bearing in mind that they should be systematic in their approach and clear in presenting their case. In his abstaining to vote he has implicitly accepted the principle of voting when it is proved that abstention from voting is indirect voting.   If we vote we will not bring any Muslim to power.   It is indeed correct, but who said that our aim (in the near future) is to bring a Muslim into power. Our realistic aim in the near future is to have a better person with a better system in power. It is impractical to think of having a true Muslim leader in the near future in most non-Muslim countries. Our ultimate aim is to help those who are better than their co-politicians.   The one who authored the above article was:  Dr. Haitham al-Haddad is a jurist and serves as a judge for the Islamic Sharia Council (UK & Eire). He has studied the Islamic sciences for over 20 years under the tutelage of renowned scholars such as the late Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia as well as the retired Head of the Kingdom's Higher Judiciary Council."

It's basically the Islam you described and it's beliefs are held by a large portion of people in Pakistan/India specifically. They focus on spiritually the same as Sufi's but do not have saints or Pir's but rather individual zikr instead of group.   The movement was started by Shah Waliullah Dehlawi who is regarded has a great scholar of Islam.

islam,3dqf8i,AndTheEgyptianSmiled,2,Sat Jul 18 18:01:34 2015 UTC,"Not true(not what you said about sudanis but what you said about evryone who speaks it being arab) Arabs have certain genetic markers. The official definition is someone whos parents originate from either original arabs,  or arabized arabs. Arabs originated from arabia and parts of the levant(palestine and jordan) but spread to kufa(iraq). Eventually, due to the islamic conquests some arab tribes had moved to the maghreb and mixed with sahrawi people in modern SADR and  arabized the maghrebis. Egypt was also arabized in a similair way. These arabs in egypt and maghreb and sudan and whatnot were mixed but have significantly less originally arab blood(if any at all) than arabs in arabia. In the levant they were mixed with other semetic peoples and in Iraq they were mixed with persians. So most arab to least arab is probably this: Arabia(yemen saudi oman), other khaleejis(mixed persians and arab but mostly arab), iraq(mixed persian and arab but mostly arab), levant(mixed other semetic and arab), sahrawis,  egyptians, Sudanis, maghrebis, Swahilis. Sahrawis were directly mixed with tribes from arabia but morrocans and algerians were mostly berber with a little arab ancestry.   . Most  arabs in the maghreb, egypt and swahili were arabized, but are still arab due to genetic markers and assimilation.  .  I did some reading on this."

I saw this post elsewhere on reddit and had the same feeling without the context you provided in the comments.   O mankind, We have created you male and female, and appointed you races and tribes, that you may know one another. Surely the noblest among you in the sight of God is the most God fearing of you.   The ayat you posted, as I understand it, is meant explain that there should be no division in the Ummah. Ramadan is mandatory to glorify the greatness of Allah(swt). When you confound Eid with your political movement, how do continue to glorify the greatness of Allah(swt) and support the oneness of the Ummah while actively sewing division amongst people with race and focusing not on Allah(swt) but on #BlackoutEid?  On a wider topic of why I down voted the post. I was recently listening to a lecture from Dr. Bilal Phillips entitled ""Moral Culture in Islam"" where pretty early on he discusses ""the worst of all affairs are the innovations in religion. For indeed, any innovation in religion is cursed by Allah(swt). No matter how good people might think it is, or how good people might say it is, it is cursed by Allah(swt)"" There is much to be said about this by the Prophet(pbuh) as well here  These types of posts appear to be more of an exercise in vanity than they do worship. There is a growing movement, especially in social circles on the Internet, which seek to redefine Islam to be all inclusive and accepting of immoral lifestyles all under the phrase of ""only Allah(swt) can judge us."" Posts like these, IMHO, appear to glorify a political campaign or the fashion choices of those attended Eid and not Allah(swt). May Allah(swt) guide and forgive us for our sins."

It is not something that be cherry-picked. You either believe and strive to follow, or you do not.  I understand that many people in the world are oppressed, and InShaa'Allah they will be shown mercy for Allah(swt) does not test a person with that they cannot bear.

The woman who had her nose pierced looks like she is from Sudan, and IIRC nose piercing is normal in that region especially the region in Eritrea and NW Ethiopia, although no idea about her culture specifically.

islam,3dqf8i,guinness88,2,Sat Jul 18 19:39:23 2015 UTC,"being judgemental(not judging) is haram because it is being mean to others.    Evidence? Perhaps you meant to say that the actions resulting from judging somebody are often haram but not always. If you still claim that judging somebody is haram, then go ahead and marry somebody who doesn't pray, wear hijab in public (Either female or male and yes hijab exists for male), eats haram food, regularly lies, etc.   Also, I knew that Nose rings are not 100% haram, i was trying to convey that.   If you knew, then why are you trying to convey that?  Had I not corrected you, somebody without the knowledge reading your post would have thought that nose rings are haram and had their decisions influenced because of this. Believe me, the potential consequences from this are NOT small.  Let me illustrate you an example:  A Tigre woman meets someone of her dreams. Both parties meet to discuss about marriage. The man realises that she has pierced her nose and he recalls reading somewhere (your post) that it is haram. Being religious man, he asks her not to wear it. She disagrees stating that it is halal.  Bad things that can happen few days later:   An argument ensues on this topic and in the end he decides not to marry her because she has refused to remove it. This man's father meets her and her family. Let's say, this father is quite conservative (in a bad way) and has disallowed this marriage to happen because he thinks they're not religious because of nose piercing.   Of course, this is very unlikely to happen but it's still possible."

The verses in the Qur'an about fighting and warfare have to do with Islamic history. The Muslims were a small community of people who believed in the God of Abraham in Mecca, a city of idol-worshipers.  For a time, the idol-worshipers barely tolerated the God-worshipers (who referred to themselves as ""Muslim"", meaning ""one who submits to God""). The Meccans eventually began to wage war on the Muslims and threaten their lives, at which point the Qur'anic verses came instructing the Muslims about the legality of fighting with the idol-worshipers of Mecca.  Fighting in self defense was required of Muslims, but several rules were put forward, which are detailed in other verses of the Qur'an. For example, Muslims could not attack first, or harm innocent people. They were forbade from even harming livestock or fruit trees. That's how anti-violence Islam is.  Most of these verses you're quoting are glaringly misunderstood out of context, and in same cases deceitfully translated. There are billions of Muslims in the world, and just ask any one of them if their religion makes them kill non-Muslims and any one of them could tell you ""no""."

We are 1/4th of the worlds population. 1.8 billion people reading from this same book which you, and so many others, believe that it teaches us to kill indiscriminately.   If the Qur'an truly taught us to kill the infidel (which is actually a Catholic concept) blood would run the streets in every country of the world in the name of Islam. And not just a few marines killed here and there, or murdering people for drawing muhammed, or trying to kill the most people with a bomb during a marathon. Noone would be safe, the violence would never cease.  Either the 300,000 extremists or so that do this (and I'm just coming up with a random number, but if we wanted to go higher 'just incase' lets even say 1 million) are following the true Islam and the other 1.xxx billion Muslims are wrong and not following their faith correctly, or the extremists are wrong.

islam,3dtxam,Noo-,6,Sun Jul 19 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"I'd like you to read this passage and tell me what you think   They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and soul. 13 All who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, were to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.   Sound familiar? It's in your and your chosen people's book, (please be sure to fact check me, 2 chronicles 15 with the verses listed in the excerpt above). Not many ways to misread that, right? Every Jew and Christian that are't actively killing every Hindu, even the innocent babies and mothers, must be a hypocrite!  I know, I know, that's the old testament, you as a Christian should be able to maneuver your way out of being accountable for those words that God sent down (I looked into your posting history to make sure you weren't a troll, we should talk Destiny after we're done with this!).   I gotta admit, I was a little frustrated when I realized this so I took it out on my copy of the Bible tossed it aside a bit harshly. Feeling remorseful, I went to pick it up and you wouldn't believe what stood out to me in big bold letters  God’s Wrath Against Sinful Humanity  Yikes! Sounds scary. Let's read together, shall we? (found it in Romans 1. Again, I kept the verses listed in the excerpt. Bolding is mine.)   18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 19 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20 For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.  21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.  24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.  26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.  28 Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. 29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31 they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. 32 Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.   Wow, I guess God really does want to put homosexuals to death, huh? And people that don't believe in Him.  ...wait a minute. It's on the tip of my tongue, that term for when a person doesn't believe or believes in something different... I think I got it!  Infidel! Sounds a lot like the New Testament wants to kill me, an infid- man, I'm having the weirdest case of deja vu, I feel like I just read that.   The opening line of your OP, ""The Quran says to kill me (as a Infidel)"", that's where. Man, that would have bugged me all day if I didn't figure it out.  I feel better.  Anyway, if you made it this far without being too pissed, I hope you can properly relate with how most /r/islam regulars feel when we see posts like yours. You don't have to argue the points above, anyone that's ever picked up the New Testament or the Old Testament knows that there's so much more to the book than just reading verses and assuming I know everything about the religion. Our three Abrahamic faiths are ones of such beauty and mercy and compassion that it's such a shame anyone would ever judge it based on a few cherry picked verses with no historical context or scholarly views. I mean, there are people out there that are dedicating their lives start from before puberty (and going well into their twilight years) studying and contemplating all the overwhelming wealth of knowledge and critical thought surrounding these 3 religious texts of ours. Of course they're all idiots, how hard is it to read a verse? Just kidding :)  The Bible has so many beautiful stories. Like how Mary, the descendant of the legendary kings David and Solomon, was hand picked by God to give birth to Jesus though she was still pure. Or when Noah begged and pleaded with his people to seek salvation; and how his compassion and love for humanity allowed him to continue doing so, despite their constant refusal over countless years. And how can I skip over my favorite story of all, when Moses and the Israelites were stuck between a vast body of water and a murderous army, Moses kept his trust with God and continued heading toward the sea. That conviction in his trust with Allah, that's why I named my son Musa. I pray that he can live up to his namesake!  Uh oh, I did it again, I got the Bible and the Qur'an mixed up. That's what I get for reading both books. I guess I lucked out, since those stories are in both books. You know, you may have caught me midway through if you'd actually read more than just ""parts"" of the Qur'an yourself. You may even learn some extra stuff about your lord and savior that didn't make it into the canonical bible (Compare Link_1 and Section 2 of Link_2 if you want an example)  So yeah, anyway, I'm struggling to find a strike team for ps3 Destiny, what console are you on? Currently focusing on Warlock, not sure whether to go sunsinger or not. I'm really enjoying the mid-to-long range accuracy of the pulse rifle with a trusty shotgun at my side for ohcraptwentyvex moments. Any playstyles you see work particularly well?  Now that Ramadan has finished I have some free time to get back into gaming again, I plan to tinker around with my builds/loadouts later today. I don't have any exotics so the options are limited.

A year should give him enough time to slowly engage his family about Islam. He can also move out just for the duration of Ramadan if possible.   I think fasting is the easiest to hide and you can make a lot of excuses based on health or diet. He is not allowed to miss or skip fasting unless he is sick or travelling for a valid reason.

Indonesians only started settling in Papua about 60 years ago when they claimed the whole region after kicking the Dutch out. Kinda hypocritical, they railed against Dutch colonialism and immediately started their own campaign of colonialism, with people from Java basically being exported all over the tribal areas to sort of cement their hegemony over everything. There is a lot of conflict going on over this and it has more to do with being forced to become minorities in their own communities than anything to do with religion."

Honestly, your question is like asking if any other woman went into a western marriage merely to abuse a man. The law can't touch her for that because as far as their concerned their marriage was as legitimate as any other and it merely didn't work out. Though inevitably, injustice remains, this injustice doesn't merely exist within abused relationships, the entire world/society is filled with injustice. In the end, we Muslims can only turn to Him when our fragile legal systems hit their end. There is not true justice among human systems, which is why we depend on His justice to bring forth and assert the truth."

It's returned after a divorce if it doesn't last long.    Men are also abused by theor wives and women do the wrong thing just as well   How can they when their the head of the family?   Women have the power to marry men, make money off their dowry and then leave whenever, losing nothing in the process whilst gaining wealth. Men lose both a companion and their wealth.    Men can marry more than 1.  They need to go through a marriage concelor Iman and the family. While he can end it in 3 words.  Divorced women aren't treated well at all.

According to the famous Islamic legal scholar Ibn Qayyim (1292-1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.

Do not seek out one another’s faults; do not spy on one another; do not compete with one another; do not envy one another; do not hate one another; do not turn away from one another. Be, O slaves of Allah, brothers.”   In ‘Awn al-Ma‘bood (9/2195-2196) it says:   “Beware of suspicion” means: beware of following suspicion or beware of negative thinking, for suspicion is an accusation that comes to mind without any evidence. End quote.   Al-‘Allaamah Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:   What is prescribed for the believer is to respect his brother if he offers an excuse to him, to accept his apology if possible, and to think positively of him as much as possible, striving to keep hearts free of resentment and aiming to bring about unity and co-operation in doing good.

Even my Mother who is very supportive of me has been saying lately that she wished I would wear pants and a regular shirt instead of always wearing abaya.   I tell her I've been dressing this way for at least six years I don't plan on changing anytime soon, or to make others happy. I ask if she's embarrassed to be seen out with me and she says no, it's just dangerous now.  Sometimes when I think negatively about it I question if I'm unintentionally putting her in harms way when we are out together and it makes me feel a bit selfish. Though, it's safe here I think. But it only takes one crazy person to cause so much chaos and hurt. Like the murder of those three young adults in North Carolina.   When it happened I thought to myself ""Who would think it possible to murder three muslims in North Carolina?"" The thinking doesn't make sense. I guess I'm just trying to comprehend how a state with such a small population with an even smaller muslim population compared to these big metropolitan cities can see a triple homicide over religious and cultural bigotry. And then I think ""It could just as easily be West Virginia."" where I currently live."

But really, they're like any other people. Some are religious, some are in between, some aren't at all.   My theory is that living in a theocracy has an effect on some people of making them anti-religious. Nobody likes to be forced into anything and it's only natural to rebel against that. It's just proof of the Qur'anic injunction against compulsion in religion."
islam,3dp8x7,plabadajan,11,Sat Jul 18 03:36:25 2015 UTC,California? It's more prevalent there than other places in America but there are religious and non-religious Iranians everywhere.  Under the Shah the country had a period of secularization and Westernization that left a lot of people encultured towards not taking religion seriously.  When the revolution happened it was overwhelmingly those people that left Iran to go to America.  The religious ones stayed at home.  This is in contrast to most other countries that Muslims have emigrated from where religious and non-religious people both were represented.

So perhaps some of them are disillusioned and are unwilling to practice a religion that they associate with repression and harsh laws.  Being a Singaporean Muslim, we still have our fair share of ""good"" and ""bad"" Muslims but I guess the difference is that we were never forced by our government to practice our faith, which I guess seems to result in less hypocritical Muslims?

islam,3dp8x7,Nmathmaster123,7,Sat Jul 18 16:39:29 2015 UTC,"The thing is this is not unique to Iranians actually, and that if you compare to other immigrant groups with Muslim backgrounds like Turks, Arabs, Indonesians, etc, you find that many of them are promiscuous tattooed drunkards. I've actually noticed with these Iranians that many of them deny being Muslim, because I guess in that sense they are a little more honest. You will find with lots of Arabs that they do all these haram hypocritical things in private, but then in front of everyone will act like Islam is so important to them and they're super pious and judgmental. I had a khaliji friend in the US who thought as long as he lived in the US it wasn't really bad if he drank and slept around, so long as he went back to his home country he starts practicing Islam and marries a pious virgin cousin.  Anyway you can't judge Iranians too harshly this way because it's just a hypocritical judgement. In Tajikistan for example the people are Persian-speaking of Iranian origin, so ethnically they are nearly the same, but one of the main differences is that they are Sunni and Iranians are mostly Shia, so Sunni Tajiks consider themselves religiously superior to Iranians. I've had Tajiks tell me the exact same thing, that Iranians are hypocrites who drink alcohol and Iranian women wear short skirts, which is funny because both are basically illegal in Iran, but in Tajikistan people do these things openly because they legalize it. I wonder why they don't criticize themselves as much as they criticize Iranians.  Also /u/plabadajan is right that many of the Iranian immigrants to the West are evil, Islam-hating ones. However, it must be said that religious Iranians also live in the West, but they separate their communities. So for example irreligious Iranians will dissociate from religious Iranians and vice versa, so if you bother to find an Iranian mosque you will meet all the practicing Iranians or even not-so-religious ones that still have a great respect for Islam and its role in their culture."

It's easy to understand why you might dislike a religion (or any ideal for that matter) when you've seen first-hand the actions of factions like the Iranian revolutionary government or religious police.

Are we going to start disguising our mosques? Start to close down mosques after attacks for ""protection""?  We're not responsible for these actions and we shouldn't have to suffer for them either. This is our religious holiday, it sends the wrong message to everyone out there.  We're a community that went through one of the most destructive attacks on American soil in decades that lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent lives.

Prayer is one of those things that we should never compromise on unless our lives were in direct danger.

Then come out and say that the community came under direct threats instead of saying that they did it out of respect to the families being effected. That's equating your religious duties to the crime being committed which had nothing to do with each other.  Eid prayer is NOT EQUAL to supporting terrorism  They're holding a vigil/memorial for the victims, which they should, but they've canceled Eid prayer out of safety concerns?

islam,3dmgxc,InMemoryOf,7,Fri Jul 17 22:53:27 2015 UTC,"This is so wrong.  Praying the Eid prayer is neither insulting nor disrespectful towards the victims and their family. It is a purely spiritual event (not connected in any way to wordly affairs or events) where muslims thank Allah (swt) for having given them the will, the strength and the endurance to observe the fast of the holy month of Ramadan. No matter how sad we feel, the community is not to be blamed for the acts of a murderer and doesn't have to show clean hands.   It would have been somehow understandable if the Eid was all about parading in town, drinking and partying until dawn but it's not. It's about thanking Allah and remembering His blessings, sharing with your family, giving to the poor and strengthening the bonds within the Ummah.  Also the ""we're chattanoogans first"" is completely unnecessary. We're muslim first. Being ""muslim first"" doesn't mean you cannot integrate to whatever country or city you live in and it certainly doesn't mean you don't condemn such atrocious events.  And please ban /u/Noo-."

Why does it have to be a reasoning that is negative according to you? Secondly, how do you know they didn't pray it elsewhere? How do you know they didn't arrange it at people's homes? You don't.  It seems like they considered the Maqasid ash-Shari'ah and the context of culture/people around them and made a decision based off of it.   There's no need for anyone of us, who are not scholars in the field, and say ""oh, but you're supposed to pray it because it's obligatory"". Well, you're supposed to make wudhu properly too before Salah but that ended up in the death of a sahabah, radi Allahu anhu, and the Prophet, sal Allahu `alayhi wa salam, repeatedly told the other companions that told that companion to make wudhu over his head wound that they murdered him."

We could already wipe out the entire Muslim world five times over by next year; ""arming and training"" isn't going to accomplish much in the context of the conflict with Islam.  Military superiority accomplishes nothing without a means to effectively use it, and the problem here isn't an enemy army, it's an idea.  What will actually help is education.  More people reading the Qur'an in the vernacular, more people being exposed to information via the internet, more people having the chance to compare for themselves the benefits of Islam as a social system vs. liberal democracy.  They're fundamentally incompatible, and the current violent outbursts are just the start of that conflict - the real danger to our societies is the slow and insidious acceptance of primitive, anti-human ideas (for example, fundamental inequality of the sexes.)    We have to win this conflict, but it can be won only through education and reform - and as Islam is unlikely to be reformed,  the best thing we can do is give people reasons to abandon it, by showing them how poorly it works for them compared to the available alternatives.  It's hard, and it's subtle, but violence is what they want.  The only real weapon we have is information.  Things will likely deteriorate further before they improve."

islam,3dmxxx,elpequenotigre,5,Fri Jul 17 16:25:51 2015 UTC,A mere scarf on the head doesn't automatically equal modest.
islam,3dmxxx,derintellectual,2,Fri Jul 17 16:59:49 2015 UTC,but being a fashionista doesn't automatically negate hijab either.
islam,3dmxxx,kyahalhai08,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:52:26 2015 UTC,It goes against its primary principles. The only thing that separates these fashionita's from those contemporary other fashion models is the scarf on their head.
islam,3dmxxx,derintellectual,2,Fri Jul 17 18:28:32 2015 UTC,There is a difference between looking presentable and looking attractive; this is clearly highlighted in the Qur'an. Wearing almost nothing is comparable something colorful or tight. Both are eye catching.
islam,3dmxxx,elpequenotigre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"It's comparable but I understand it isn't always the case. Just search 'hijab tutorial' and it ranges from presentable to calling for attention.  No offense to the women who wish to dress up from time to time, it's half the men's responsibility to protect their modesty as well."
islam,3dmxxx,elpequenotigre,2,Sat Jul 18 13:45:55 2015 UTC,"You're not just seeing long flaired skirts (which is okay), but skinny jeans and leggings, which according to the Prophet, tight clothing is equal to wearing nothing."

islam,3dmxxx,turkeyfox,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:20:15 2015 UTC,Tight jeans I saw. I think what he means is the poses and the excessive make up a lot of hijabi fashionistas use.  Women really do love self beautification at most levels. Literally all personality characters of women.

islam,3dju5x,marmulak,3,Fri Jul 17 02:49:21 2015 UTC,"This happens every single year in Saudia I'm almost desensitized to it by now. Every single year it's a battle between astronomers and eye witnesses. What's infuriating is that astronomers never win.   In any case, it's always Eid Mubarak!"
islam,3dju5x,MalcolmY,0,Fri Jul 17 10:28:40 2015 UTC,"بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم  al-hamdulillah that they never win. The religion does not point to astronomy for how to know when a month starts and ends. And the only madhdhhab that accepts astronomy for this issue is the shafi3i madhdhhab, at least that is what I know, and the ruling madhdhhab in Saudi is the Hanbali madhdhhab, and they don't accept astronomy as ways for knowing when the month starts and ends, and Allah knows best."
islam,3dju5x,djabirbinmarwan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:57:15 2015 UTC,"Well here's the thing, it's not a competition between astronomers and Muslims. Astronomers provide information, and Muslims decide how to use that information. So the thing is, being an astronomer doesn't make you qualified to decide Islamic rules like what conditions must be met for Ramadan to begin or end.  Therefore, if the shariah is that Ramadan begins and ends when people see the moon, then it's necessary for the new moon to be visible. Astronomers producing calculations and saying it must be Ramadan now because the moon is 0% waxing is not the Islamic criteria for the month.  I read the reports online that the new moon was announced in Saudi Arabia and that they claim the moon was seen, but I want to have more information. For example, who saw the moon? When? How did they see it? Were they astronomers using a very powerful telescope? Where are the images then?  The Islamic calendar is observation-based, and there are other complexities that scholars still debate about and take up different positions on. Saying that astronomers ""lose"" because our calendar is observation-based rather than calculation-based is silly. Both methods have their pros and cons, and the science itself doesn't make judgement."

islam,3dk8y0,aliduz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:27:31 2015 UTC,"According to the Islamic Society of Victoria it was sighted, see the Fajr khutaba at Preston Mosque. All the Islamic Board of Exams decided it was today and as Ibn Taymiyaah said if the ummah decides Eid is today it is haram to fast because of the Hadith that says that the day the people break their fast is Eid.  Anyways to each their own."
islam,3dk8y0,aliduz,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:52:00 2015 UTC,"Where was the moon sighted?   Ibn Tamiyyah is one opinion of many.  They took their priests, their ancestors and scholars to be their lords in substitute of Allah and (they also took as their Lord) Christ, the son of Maryam (may Allah be pleased with her); Yet they were commanded (in their books) to worship none but one Allah; there is no god but He. Glorified is He (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him). (Qur’an; 9:31)  Its also Haram to not fast without a valid reason in the month of Ramadan, as the Hadith mentions  Allah's Messenger (peace_be_upon_him) said: Whenever you sight the new moon (of the month of Ramadan) observe fast, and when you sight it (the new moon of Shawwal) break it, and if the sky is cloudy for you, then observe fast for thirty days.  But your right, each to their own...Ibn Tamiyyah is very special but I'll follow Quran and Sunnah every time..."
islam,3dk8y0,auslim,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:07:11 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm a fan of the official statement from the Islamic Council of Queensland:   The Islamic Council of Queensland together with The Council of Imams Queensland has adopted the approach of determining the day of Eid ul Fitr on the basis of the sighting of the Moon (with the naked eye) within Australia.  If the moon is sighted on Thursday 16 July 2015, In-sha-Allah we will celebrate Eid ul Fitr on Friday, otherwise Eid will be celebrated on Saturday 18 July 2015, In-sha-Allah.  This approach is consistent with the approach we have adopted in recent years and we are of the view that it is supported by the vast majority of our members.  We appreciate that this approach may differ with other Islamic organisations. We fully respect their right to adopt a different approach and we thank them for respecting ours.  We encourage all Muslims in Australia to avoid any disharmony over this matter and accept that a diversity of opinion is permissible.  From all of us here at ICQ, we wish you all a very happy Eid and request that you remember us in your prayers as we near the end of yet another Ramadan."
islam,3dk8y0,aliduz,-1,Fri Jul 17 06:03:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, but the information I have is that no moon was sighted (nor visable) within Australia. Is that correct?   Here in NSW the majority of masjids and communities are celebrating Eid tomorrow becaise of that."
islam,3dk8y0,auslim,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:24:30 2015 UTC,I agree as well. This was the announcement from Victoria:   All praise be to Allah (Subhanahu Wata’ala) the most Gracious and the most Merciful.  Board of Imams Victoria (BOIV) is pleased to announce that the 1st day of Shawwal 1436 will be on Friday 17th July 2015 Insha Allah.  Board of Imams Victoria (BOIV) President Sheikh Isse Musse & the Member Imams send their warmest Eid al Fitr greetings to all Victorian Muslims and the entire Muslim community all over Australia.  *The Astronomical New Moon is expected to be on Thursday 16th July 2015 at 11:24am AEST thus the first possible visibility of the New Crescent Moon (Hilal) will be after sunset at 5.05pm Insha Allah . The New Crescent Moon (Hilal) is expected to remain at the horizon of Australia for approximately 19 minutes as the moonset will occur at 5.24pm AEST Insha Allah.   There were no reports of it being sited yesterday; but it was theoretically visible as detailed above.
islam,3dk8y0,aliduz,0,Fri Jul 17 06:27:46 2015 UTC,"Allah accept either way, I know there are difference of opinion for moon sighting local moon sighting vs global moon sighting.   Although among the fuqaha it's agreed the stronger position is local moon sighting and its what I adhere too.   I suppose what annoyed me was the patronising comment about how its haram to fast on Eid. Which is obvious...But the sword cuts both ways and judgments pertaining to breaking ones fast while there is still fasts remaining in Ramadan couldbe attributed to those celebrating Eid today in Australia...  May Allah accept everyone's sincere fast and Eid and forgive our shortcomings and mistakes."

islam,3dm9rq,HMTheEmperor,6,Fri Jul 17 12:33:10 2015 UTC,"There are a few Muslims here who focus on purifying themselves and bettering themselves through ibadah. But the ones who really do are too humble to share. But I think there is a heavy emphasis towards salafism in the states, and maybe most people who are on that path don't realize it, but if the knowledge you are gaining is devoid of spirituality, and if your really aren't reflecting every day or so on if you are improving, then maybe you should re-evaluate where you're going. This sub in particular is very rituals-based, and you're not going to find guidance, just information."
islam,3dm9rq,chikken_biryani,6,Fri Jul 17 14:26:37 2015 UTC,"I think what Islam did for me spiritually was that it, in a sense, relaxed me. I'm growing up around teens and at this age a lot of people have what's called an 'existential crisis', which, from what I've heard, happens when people are just utterly unsure of what they should do or what might happen and they indulge their mind with the overwhelming pursuit of trying to understand the future and what's going to happen with them and their life.   As a Muslim who grew up around this, I was a bit indifferent to it all, I don't mean to be pedantic but honestly it sounded quite silly to me. Worrying about things like purpose and meaning never really happened to me as I was brought up knowing the teachings of Islam. For me, there was no value in spending my time worrying about the future and my existence, I knew what the purpose of existence was and the answer to questions that one might ask themselves I already had.  I did have my own phase where I questioned the fundamentals of where my ideals stand and when I tried to understand what Islam was for me. In the end, I was pretty satisfied with the conclusion of what life meant. There was no doubt in my convictions and it gave me a lot of inner peace. I think a lot of other people feel similar about Islam in this sense. Life is just to overwhelming to be confused all the time. Either you accept your uncertainty or you go on a search. That search led me to solidify such convictions and is the reason I am a Muslim to this day."
islam,3dm9rq,UntitledTales,3,Fri Jul 17 14:54:43 2015 UTC,"Hello from the Chicago area! We have many Urdu speakers here from Pakistan and India. Amazing, generous people, and the biryani is awesome!  I'm a philosophical pluralist, and I focus on what works for me. I began studying the Qu'ran, as well as the rest of the world's religious and philosophical texts, when I was very young: Huston Smith was a huge idol of mine early on (until I found out about his drug use).   After moving to the Chicago area, I started meeting many Muslims, and was invited to some events, and I now try to make it to jummah every Friday--but, being disabled, I'm frequently unable.  I'm moving from an intellectual understanding of the Qu'ran and Islam, to one of tawhid, ummah, sunnah, and din it seems to me.   Ramadan has been a wonderful experience. I've been reading a lot, and trying to pick up on the various practices and rules of the Muslims in my community. People have been very encouraging, and very gentle when correcting me.  I jumped on an opportunity to go to The Islamic Community Center of Des Plaines for a lecture on Sharia about a month ago that was eye-opening. It has given me the tools to correct many misconceptions about Sharia, as well as how authority works among sholars, sheiks, imams, and the ummah with those who know nothing about Islam but what the tv tells .  I will say, jummah is a weekly reprieve from the foolishly extreme individualism and materialism so prevalent among so many in the US.  Salam, John"

Saying ""Ya Ali madad"" is shirk for Sunnis yet a cornerstone for Shias.  People are going to have to realize that Sunni-Shia unity is only ever going to come when we stop pretending like we're the same. We're not. We have some huge differences, ESPECIALLY when it comes to tawhid. That doesn't mean we have to fight, but it does mean that we have to acknowledge that there are things we are never going to agree on and to stop trying to make that happen.

All you're saying is ""unity should be upon Sunnism"" to Sunnis or ""unity should be upon Shi'ism"" to Shias because that's what ""Haqq"" means to them. It's not advocating unity, it's saying that unity isn't a priority at all and sectarianism should be one's primary focus but saying it in a way that makes it seem like you're pro-unity so you don't get called out on it. Unity needs to be made a priority in and of itself. If we qualify it by saying ""yes unity but this"" or ""yes unity but that"" then we're not saying yes to unity at all.   https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/3c8od2/as_a_shia_this_subredit_is_very_unwelcoming/cstt6ys"

Edit: http://www.sistani.org/english/qa/01262/  Question: Can one say one’s congregational prayer behind a Sunni Imam with the intention of Jama'at (congregation)?

But for different reasons.  Your reason for not praying behind me is because you think my beliefs are wrong.  My reason for not praying behind you is because your mechanical actions in salat are wrong.  It's no different than my not wanting to pray behind a Shia person who does his salat wrong.

islam,3dlr4v,SalaciousSarah,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:15:05 2015 UTC,"Great article! I assume you're writing this for school or something? Here are my suggestions:   The date of Eid al-Fitr changes every year, as instead of being based on the Western calendar it is the day after the first sighting of the crescent moon, in the eighth month of the year.   This is a little bit unclear. It sounds a little bit like you're saying that Eid occurs after the first sighting of the new moon in August specifically. I'd try to reword this. Also, Eid is on the first day of Shawwal, which is the 10th month of the Islamic calendar.   Throughout the month of Ramadan, Muslims around the world will go without food and drink during the day to test their will and to understand better their own limits and self-control.    The rest of the article is in the present tense, but this sentence is in the future. I'd change it to present tense to be more consistent.    Although the fasting isn’t over   I assume you refer to people fasting 6 days in Shawwal. You might want to put some explanation of that in here, because I don't think it's something most non-Muslims (for whom I assume you're writing this article) are aware of.   This gift-giving isn’t as commercial as some others   As some other what? I assume you mean holidays, such as Christmas, but it's not entirely clear.   After a small and sweet breakfast, they will perform an act of charity and then usually attend a public Eid prayer for the poor and needy which is often held in a large open area, such as a field.   Again, mixed tenses. Change the future to the present to be consistent.    The most quintessential of foods is the Sheer khurma, a sweet and delicious treat of dates cooked in milk.   This is a traditional South Asian food, but I don't think you can really say it's a typical food for all Muslims.   I'd also suggest that you break up the entire thing into 2-3 paragraphs to make it a little easier to read."

The article was in rough draft, I just wanted to try and get as many of the facts right as possible - which is difficult when it seems to be celebrated differently everywhere!

I often wonder why the world Muslim ummah doesn't sit down and decide that for Islamic religious activities, the day starts at from Mecca/Medina. People of these cities and people of this cities' timezone should be first to fast, first to eid, etc. Then it flows west of there, Palestine, Syria, Egypt, .... France, United Kingdom, Brazil, US, Japan, Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc."

islam,3digje,shymouse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't edit my comment. You probably misunderstood it. But then again I probably could have better worded what I was saying. Everything would work just like solar day works except solar day would start in Mecca/Medina. If people east of these cities sea the moon, they're a day behind. They gotta wait their turn as the earth rotates toward west, eventually coming back to Mecca."
islam,3digje,45691217,5,Mon Jul 20 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"because it does not concordant with Sunnah. If you look up the Hadith, and I am paraphrasing here so dont lecture me on accurate words here, it says that when you see the new moon, you have to fast and when you see the new moon, you break your fast and celebrate the Eid."
islam,3digje,jacquesrabbit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. However, the earth is a globe and it rotates. So there's no physical start line for the globes rotation. That's why international date line exists. Muslims should use it or recenter it to Mecca (which is what I was saying) for religious activities. But that would requires worldwide Ummah participation and co-operation. We all know sectarian Muslims are not capable of doing that."

The fact is, Assad is killing civilians a thousand-fold more than any other group in Syria ever could. But please, talk about how these groups like ISIS and AQ are the main problem. How about you apologize for the bombings that have killed and maimed mainly civilians in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan? Or the destabilization in Egypt ever since your leaders put into power that dog Sisi? How about the current and prolonged oppression of our Muslim people in Palestine? I could go on and on.

To paraphrase an Islamic teacher (Nouman Ali Khan), if you were to fast on random individual days it would be way more difficult, compared to doing it for a whole month straight. Additionally the fact that everyone around you is doing joining in the exercise, it adds to making it easy. Finally, after a day or two, it becomes a part of you and you hardly notice. Its so perfectly in sync with your routine that once Ramadan is over, you feel weird eating in the afternoon; you think twice before swallowing water during the day.  Also, most Muslims have been fasting in some capacity since a very young age and are excited to do so and thus spend little time to adjust to the month."

Now, 10 years later, only the first couple days are really hard for me (and not nearly as hard as that first day ever). After that, my body just gets used to it. I won't say I don't feel hungry or thirsty at all, but it just stops bothering me. I reach the point where I'm just used to ignoring it, and it doesn't really affect me.   I know I definitely have less energy than normal, but I think some of that is also because I just can't get enough sleep during Ramadan. The days are long, and I have to get up early for suhoor and I am never able to fall back asleep before work. I also have a volunteer job two nights a week after work but before iftar, so I'm really busy. Luckily my boss has allowed me to change my work hours slightly - I'm working from 7 to 3 instead of 9 to 5 - so I'm usually able to squeeze in a nap of at least a couple hours after I come home from work.  edit to add: Ramadan is actually a lot easier for me now that I'm working full time, as opposed to when I was in college or just working part time. I think it helps a lot to be busy, though maybe it's also a side effect of getting older."

The hardest part was the hours since we wake up so early to eat. But alhamdulilah it wasn't the hardest thing I've done. Also, when you eat a breakfast and skip lunch, your dying my dinner, but when you simply haven't eaten all day, it's somehow more manageable. I never feel like the hunger is so bad I can't take it."
islam,3dj8n6,chikken_biryani,2,Fri Jul 17 16:44:27 2015 UTC,Although I started fasting from a very early age. I think as I get older it's all about the suhoor.

I lose my appetite and struggle to eat enough at night, so I just feel exhausted and out of energy for the last 10 days.  I do my work during the day, but by 4-5pm, I'm completely done. I just go home and lie on the couch till iftar."

However in my opinion, if a person's job is so intensive that fasting would literally be a risk to their health, then its okay for them not to do it on work days. I feel this way for the same reasoning that sick people are exempted. If fasting while working is going to make you sick, then this stipulation applies."

It's more than the hunger and waiting to break the fast. Fasting is ultimately worship and there's something satisfying in trying to fulfill God's commandments. Not to mention, knowing that so many others are fasting along side you fosters a sense of camaraderie, and Ramadan begins to feel like an honored guest that we've welcomed with open arms. That's kind of what I kept in mind when trying to deal with others, obligations/commitments, and the Ramadan grumpies. You're meant to supersede base reactions as a Muslim, especially in this month.   It can be trying. That's part and parcel, though."
islam,3dj8n6,The_Hermione_Granger,4,Fri Jul 17 07:54:42 2015 UTC,"""If you begin thinking about food, you've already broken your fast"".   Does the unnamed scholar apply this to those preparing iftar? It doesn't just appear; you have to think about it to cook it."

islam,3dkcgi,Katirania,5,Thu Jul 16 23:37:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're being unfair at all. Your family cut you off, you try to make amends this Ramadan and they don't seem to appreciate it. I mean, its admirable. I'm sorry that your family is like that. If it was me I'd cut off all contact with them. Focus more on yourself, save money and get an education."
islam,3dkcgi,AriesxNova,4,Fri Jul 17 04:38:21 2015 UTC,"Wow. I really feel for you and I'm so sorry for what you've gone through. That said, the best thing for you to do right now is to focus on moving forward with your life in a positive manner and like the previous poster said, cut off contact. Obviously, your family is not interested in having any type of relationship with you and your efforts  to improve it is meaningless to them. So, keep your job, save your money, go to school, get a better job, get married and have your own family. You are still young and have your whole life ahead of you (sounds clichéd, but it's true). It is unfortunate that you were kicked out at such a young age. I have a friend (also Muslim) who was in a similar situation. You need to remove toxic people from your life, and family is no exception."

Some people will never change no matter how hard you try. I don't really have any constructive advice I can give you because honestly I don't have an answer to your problems or mine. But the best you can do is try to be the better person...    At times it can seem easier to just let everything fall apart... but I can assure you that its always better to push through than to give up. I hope things get easier for the both of us.

islam,3dke07,BadAsh87,10,Thu Jul 16 23:50:59 2015 UTC,"There is no narrative for a decline.   The decline of the Islamic political entity is not the same as the decline of Islam. I do not agree with your assumption that the religion has declined at all. On the contrary, in many ways, the religion has been in a steady upwards movement for quite some time. The older generation in many families is less religious than the younger one. There is a greater sense of religiosity amongst the Muslim community, a greater acknowledgement that racism and sexism exists and we need to combat it. There are unprecedented institutions such as Al-Maghrib and Bayyinah institute which are reviving the desire of average Muslims to learn about Islam. Scholars are regaining the position of respect they once held in the Muslim world. Names like Yasir Qadhi and Hamza Yusuf and Omar Suleiman are respected, whereas not that long ago, imams were considered 3rd rate individuals who couldn't hack it at a ""real job"".  So no, I don't agree that Islam has declined or is declining.  As for the political state, then dynasties rise and fall, nations form and dissolve. Political ascendancy is not a mark of pleasure or displeasure from God. The sahabah were no less beloved to God when they were oppressed in Makkah or fearing for their future in the Battle of the Ahzab than they were when they were marching into Makkah as victors.   And these days [of varying conditions] We alternate among the people  You're going to run into issues in your research paper if you confuse the religion with the political state. The religious and intellectual output of Muslim Spain was highest when it was in its political decline.   To help you out for your research paper, Noah Feldman at Harvard has a great book called The Fall and Rise of the Islamic State. It should be of great use for you in this area."
islam,3dke07,AnotherParaclete,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:31:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the confusion. I was referring to the crisis of Islam in the late 19th /early 20th century; i.e., the splintering of the caliphate, and the domination by Western colonialists. For many this didn't square with the cachet of being God's beloved nation. In other words, the Islamic empire went from being world hegemon to Orientalist 'subjects'. Different narratives were forwarded to account for this change of fortune.   Moreover, if you accept that Allah gives prosperity to those who heed his commandments--which I think is a pretty mainstream belief--then you have to account for the nadir of majority-muslim countries. I don't mean the preponderance of Islamic followers, when I talk of fortune/misfortune.  I mean in terms of economic/scientific flourishing."

I don't care if you are Jewish, or atheist, or anything in between, but you are being dishonest about your own research topic, and regardless how much you study, and how much people give their help, input and guidance to you, you may never understand the whole issue at large.

Then using that as a base Adam(pbuh) was moulded and given consciousness. Thats my best explanation for things at least, can't fully say its the truth but it seems the most likely to me.

islam,3dikbo,housebuye,5,Thu Jul 16 22:28:54 2015 UTC,"From an old comment by /u/Logical1ty:    yet Allah was so uncreative he copied 99% of DNA from apes which came about through evolution?   He created humans as mammals, in a specific niche for this world. Much of the DNA of all living creatures is shared. And Adam was created from the earth of this world through a process akin to abiogenesis. The world was meant for Adam as much as he was meant for it. It's not like the earth was just sitting here arbitrarily, God created it and everything on it too according to His plan. He was also careful to put humans down in the proper niche, the proper time and place, which indicates a purpose or plan for the history of life on Earth (rather than putting Adam down when he could get eaten by dinosaurs).  If we were to artificially create a hominid in a laboratory completely synthetically from scratch (doing each base pair manually according to a specific plan), it would necessarily share 99% of its DNA with us and other primates.  This principle (that everything, including life and its family tree, fits into a plan) isn't new. The scientists I mention (Al-Jahiz, Ibn Khaldun, Al-Biruni, etc) who have been acknowledged by historians as the closest to Darwin's theory from centuries before him all had the same view.  It makes no sense to call the creator of all life on Earth uncreative just because it fits into one big family tree. I find that very creative and poetic.  Also, human DNA did not come from apes. That is not the theory of the evolutionary origin of man. The popular theory is that we came from a common ancestor."
islam,3dikbo,moon-jellyfish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:20:47 2015 UTC,"Everything I believe did start from one organism. Allah(swt) let nature run its course until a dominant species came to. So in other words, if there had been a slight change and it turned out lizards were the best candidate then we could have been sentient lizard people.  The base that we were modelled after originated from the one organism but it's our creator's intervention which made us so special. He gave us a consciousness and fiddled around a bit with our makeup so that we could prosper further in the world that developed alongside our primate friends.  It was the perfect environment for them and therefore perfect for us. We of course must have out-competed them and drove them to extinction :\"
islam,3dikbo,NeroAngelo257,2,Thu Jul 16 22:37:32 2015 UTC,"Well then this is more of a disagreement about abiogenesis as opposed to evolution.   Does Islam allow for evolution from other species to humans? My understanding was it does not, but I'm not an expert on Islam."
islam,3dikbo,housebuye,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"I've heard there are multiple theories on the origin of life and they all sound plausible. What caused life to begin is a different debate and just depends on your personal beliefs at this point. I'd love to know which one it is for definite but either way it makes little difference to evolution of man.  With regards to evolution from other species to humans. It's a big no, that's why I have the whole belief of Allah intervening to set humans apart from the rest."
islam,3dikbo,NeroAngelo257,2,Thu Jul 16 22:51:33 2015 UTC,There are certainly multiple theories on the origin of life. No disagreement there.   Your second point is contrary to the theory of evolution. You clearly do not accept that evolution is accurate.
islam,3dikbo,housebuye,3,Thu Jul 16 23:00:52 2015 UTC,"It's tricky. The only difference between us and a previous ancestor would be sentience, possibly even minor changes that we could say developed through natural evolution. Heck maybe it was just sentience. If it were just that then we could say that it lines up with evolution until that intervention.  The last I studied in evolution was a-levels so I'm not that well versed in it. I moved onto pharmacology and biomedicine so I'm a bit rusty haha"

islam,3dikbo,NeroAngelo257,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:04:10 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I don't see it that way. The evolution still occurred but just like any test there was an endpoint. Our 'ancestor' was the endpoint. Once the first human was made, the primate would still exist and be able to evolve. It just would've lacked things like self awareness. I see what you mean though.   For most people evolution would've been letting it occur with no intervention and the outcome to be the first human. I just can't see something developing sentience like that through biological development.  There's still other species which are evolving through natural selection. So even if my little belief about humans is not in line with evolution, the evolution of other animals is still pretty much a fact.  Also, thanks for debating with me. I needed some preparation for my upcoming GAMSATs XD"

islam,3dikbo,YourSenpai_,16,Thu Jul 16 23:44:43 2015 UTC,"We mustn't fall into the same category as creationists, it's the 21st century for Allah's sake. This is why much of the modern world still considers Muslims as primitive despite the fact that we used to be ahead of our time, and we still could be if we chose to stop being so close-minded. I took an Anthropology course specifically to challenge the notion of human evolution. I learned that race does not exist from a genetic standpoint which is what we already believe. I also learned that there is no way one can simply deny the history of prehominids without sheer ignorance. What about the fact that most Europeans and Asians have 1 to 4 percent Neanderthal DNA? What about the fact that humans are 98% genetically identical to chimpanzees? How does one simply dismiss facts such as these without any rational reason for doing so? Let's also not forget one of Allah's 99 names is Al Bari, which means ""the Evolver"".   Here are some verses which point more towards evolution than they do the contrary:  Holy Quran 71:17  وَاللَّهُ أَنْبَتَكُمْ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ نَبَاتًا  And Allah has caused you to grow from the earth a [progressive] growth.  Please tell me how the meaning of the word نَبَاتًا is not indicative of anything other than evolution, a process.   Nowhere in the famous verse from Surah Al-Baqarah does it say Adam was the first human, and I challenge anyone to provide a verse in which Allah says Adam was the first homo sapian because I currently have no reason to believe anything besides the fact that he was the first Prophet according to Allah himself:   Holy Quran 2:30  وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً ۖ قَالُوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَنْ يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ ۖ قَالَ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ  Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: ""I will create a vicegerent on earth."" They said: ""Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?"" He said: ""I know what ye know not.""  Even modern science acknowledges an initial ancestor we all share in common, but once again I challenge anybody to show me an Ayat in which Allah specifically says it was Adam:  Holy Quran 39:6  خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَأَنْزَلَ لَكُمْ مِنَ الْأَنْعَامِ ثَمَانِيَةَ أَزْوَاجٍ ۚ يَخْلُقُكُمْ فِي بُطُونِ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ خَلْقًا مِنْ بَعْدِ خَلْقٍ فِي ظُلُمَاتٍ ثَلَاثٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ فَأَنَّىٰ تُصْرَفُونَ  He created you (all) from a single person: then created, of like nature, his mate; and he sent down for you eight head of cattle in pairs: He makes you, in the wombs of your mothers, in stages, one after another, in three veils of darkness. such is Allah, your Lord and Cherisher: to Him belongs (all) dominion. There is no god but He: then how are ye turned away (from your true Centre)?  Once again this is more consistent with evolution than it is spontaneous creationism like the Christians believe:  Holy Quran 15:26  وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الْإِنْسَانَ مِنْ صَلْصَالٍ مِنْ حَمَإٍ مَسْنُونٍ  We created man from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape;  Allah specifically states that he began (وَبَدَأ) the creation of man with clay. What does it mean to begin or originate something? We as Muslims should be proud of the fact that we were originally responsible for the idea of evolution through natural selection, not Charles Darwin.   Holy Quran 32:7  الَّذِي أَحْسَنَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقَهُ ۖ وَبَدَأَ خَلْقَ الْإِنْسَانِ مِنْ طِينٍ  He Who has made everything which He has created most good: He began the creation of man with (nothing more than) clay.   With that being said, we must invest into learning subjects from all sides of the spectrum, whether or not some close-minded Muslims deem it as taboo. Contemplation is our duty, and for all of you Muslims who reject evolution I would like to see the actual evidence for doing so."

But the clothing of righteousness - that is best. That is from the signs of Allah that perhaps they will remember  7.27 O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise, stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts. Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them. Indeed, We have made the devils allies to those who do not believe.  Seriously, what do you think the expression children of Adam means ?...Children of Israel refers to hebrews who lived before Moses and after him. Children of Adam refers to whole mankind because Adam was our common ancestor.  And what do you make of all the hadiths about Adam and the references between his descendants and mankind?  example : Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “All of the children of Adam are sinners, and the best of sinners are those who repent.”  Let me ask you something. The Quran says Noah/Nuh died at 950 years old. (29.14)  Do you believe it? If so, how do you reconcile it with modern science?  There is also a widely accepted hadith that says Adam was 60 cubits tall.  The first men were very tall and lived for an extremely long time. How is that in accordance with modern science?"

Not only does your answer not suffice, it does not seem like you even acknowledged the challenge, if anything, you further proved my point. I asked for an Ayat in which Allah specifically says that Adam was the first man. Btw, an Ayat is a verse from Allah, Hadith =/= Ayat. With that being said, what does it mean to honor the children of Adam? That mere phrase implies that there is another group in which this particular group was honored above.   I'm going to knock out two birds with one stone in the absence of time. Why does Allah differentiate between the Children of Adam and mankind? If Adam was the first human, then why is that not mentioned in the Quran? Nowhere does Allah say it was Adam.  Holy Quran 4:1  يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالًا كَثِيرًا وَنِسَاءً ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ الَّذِي تَسَاءَلُونَ بِهِ وَالْأَرْحَامَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا  O mankind! reverence your Guardian-Lord, who created you from a single person, created, of like nature, His mate, and from them twain scattered (like seeds) countless men and women;- reverence Allah, through whom ye demand your mutual (rights), and (reverence) the wombs (That bore you): for Allah ever watches over you.  When Allah said he will place a vicegerent upon Earth (2:30), are you meaning to tell me the Earth was completely barren at this time with nothing upon it? What purpose would it serve to have a successive authority upon a land in which there was nothing or no one to even have authority placed upon? Adam was the first in a line of prophets connected by bloodline of which I am descended (I am a Sayed from my mother and father's side). I still have no reason to believe he was the first hominid to walk upon this Earth when both science and the Quran speak the contrary."
islam,3dikbo,Incognitary,2,Thu Jul 16 19:17:30 2015 UTC,"That mere phrase implies that there is another group in which this particular group was honored above.   It says right after that we were preferred over much of what Allah created. What does he mean by that? Animals, not a mysterious group of unknown humans.    Why does Allah differentiate between the Children of Adam and mankind?    He doesn't.   The words slaves, believers and muslims are used in the Quran and most of the time they all refer to the same group of people. Sometimes Allah says ""the Jews and the Christians"", sometimes he says ""People of the book"" and sometimes he says ""Those who were given the scripture"". Different words for the same people.  7.35 O children of Adam, if there come to you messengers from among you relating to you My verses, then whoever fears Allah and reforms - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.  Does this refer to all mankind in your opinion? or a specific group of humans? Why would God order only a group of humans to obey his messengers, and not whole mankind?   Once again, your theory makes no sense at all.   If Adam was the first human, then why is that not mentioned in the Quran? Nowhere does Allah say it was Adam.   You're purposely playing dumb aren't you? Why do you think Allah tells us the story of Adam, who was in Paradise before living on earth, who was taught the names of things, in front of whom Angels had to prostrate ? Adam was the first man, he was created directly from clay, he was later expelled from Paradise for disobeying to live on earth and he became the father of all mankind. Read his story when you have time.  Is there an ayat that explicitly says that we have to pray FIVE times a day? There isn't. There is not ONE verse that says muslims have to pray five times a day. But if we put several verses together, we can come to the conclusion that we have to pray at 5 different times during the day. If you put the effort into it, you'll see that everything points out towards Adam being the first man.    Adam was the first in a line of prophets connected by bloodline of which I am descended (I am a Sayed from my mother and father's side).    He's also the only prophet who was born in Paradise, doesn't that make you raise some questions?  Not sure if your ancestors would be proud of what you're saying."

I personally agree with your view, except I wouldn't definitively state Adam's particular case, as his creation story gets confusing on whether there was two creations of his body, in Janna and then again in earth and how the transfer between the two happened. Keep in mind that on Judgement day when humans are raised in their permanent Janna/hell bodies, they are raised from the ground like statues. So while Adam's particular creation is given small details in the Qur'an, any definitive answer is speculative at best."

That's not even a concrete statement since it depends on how similarities are calculated. Take for example that the  fruit fly (Drosophila) is considered to share about 60% of its DNA with humans or that 99% of mouse genes turn out to have analogues in humans.  This doesn't necessarily mean that we are related to these animals. Human beings are obviously similar to other land mammals and there are many biological similarities, and no one really denies empirical facts but this isn't a concrete proof that we evolved from animals. Even if humans were considered to be only 50% genetically identical to chimpanzees, what other theory do you think the secular world would lean towards? There is no option for secularists except some type of evolutionary process.   While the secular world focuses on how humans are similar to animals and will interpret new scientific findings to support this theory, religion/spirituality will focus on how humans are different than animals. If you took a anthropology course, then you should know how quickly people draw conclusions based on little evidence. Millions of years of hominid evolution is based on a few fossils."

Human beings are the only creatures to have a question of ethics and souls. The similarity is a test and a fitna. No wonder so many people have fallen to this deceit when it's aggressively stated as fact so much in the west. We, as Muslims, should know better.

In the Quran Allah cast Adam down from the heavens as he was when he and Hawaa/Eve ate from the forbidden tree. He was not created again on earth.    Nope.    Hadith about height of Adam and later generations explained  بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم الحمد لله وحده و الصلاة و السلام على من لا نبي بعده و على آله و أصحابه أجمعين  Here is a brief response to two objections on hadith for allegedly contradicting historical and related information; i.e. Adam's height of 60 cubits and about relation between the height of successive human generations.  Some have raised questions about hadith description of Adam’s height and statement about the height of his progeny.   The hadith goes as:  عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه، عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، قال: "" خلق الله آدم وطوله ستون ذراعا، ثم قال: اذهب فسلم على أولئك من الملائكة، فاستمع ما يحيونك، تحيتك وتحية ذريتك، فقال السلام عليكم، فقالوا: السلام عليك ورحمة الله ، فزادوه: ورحمة الله، فكل من يدخل الجنة على صورة آدم، فلم يزل الخلق ينقص حتى الآن ""  The Prophet said, ""Allah created Adam, making him 60 cubits tall. When He created him, He said to him, ""Go and greet that group of angels, and listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) and the greeting (salutations of your offspring."" So, Adam said (to the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels said, ""As-salamu Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi"" (i.e. Peace and Allah's Mercy be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam's salutation the expression, 'Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,' Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam's creation. (Sahih Bukhari, Book 55 Hadith 543)  Two points are important here:   Adam’s height Relation between the heights of successive human generations   It is said that historic information contends against both these assertions.   We deal the two briefly below;  1. Height of Adam:  The height of Adam was sixty cubits according to this hadith but other hadith reports clarify that it was so in the heavens.    عن أبي هريرة رضي الله عنه، قال: قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: «إن أول زمرة يدخلون الجنة على صورة القمر ليلة البدر، ثم الذين يلونهم على أشد كوكب دري في السماء إضاءة، لا يبولون ولا يتغوطون، ولا يتفلون ولا يمتخطون، أمشاطهم الذهب، ورشحهم المسك، ومجامرهم الألوة الأنجوج، عود الطيب وأزواجهم الحور العين، على خلق رجل واحد، على صورة أبيهم آدم، ستون ذراعا في السماء  Allah's Apostle said, ""The first group of people who will enter Paradise, will be glittering like the full moon and those who will follow them, will glitter like the most brilliant star in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit, or have any nasal secretions. Their combs will be of gold, and their sweat will smell like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their centers. Their wives will be houris. All of them will look alike and will resemble their father Adam (in statute), sixty cubits tall in the heavens.""  (Sahih Bukhari, Book 55 Hadith 544) Commonly used translation misses the translation of the last two words in the original- highlighted in red in Arabic above. See Ustadha Aisha Bewley’s translation, Hadith 3149 HERE   Scholars like Imam Abu al-‘Abbas al-Qurtubi[1] and lately Shaykh Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri[2] have said that it means the inmates of Paradise will have the height of their father Adam who was sixty cubits in the heavens.   This clarifies the first point that Adam’s height was 60 cubits in the Paradise according to this hadith and it does not say anything about his height after he landed on this planet. More on it follows under the next point.  2. Relation between the heights of successive human generations  The hadith also has the following statement towards its end;   فكل من يدخل الجنة على صورة آدم، فلم يزل الخلق ينقص حتى الآن   Normally it is translated as;   “Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam's creation.”   It is said that “ancient records or the fossil beds” do not support any such assertion. While that may be true we need to see if the hadith has been understood the right way in the first place?  Some scholars actually contend that it does not even mean this in the first place. Commenting on the highlighted phrase, one of the greatest scholars of our day, Mufti Taqi Usmani states:    ليس معناه أن قامات الناس لم تزل تنقص في كل قرن، بل المراد أن الجسم الإنسان لم يزل ناقصاً بعده. ويؤخذ هذا مما قدمناه عن شيخ مشايخنا الكشميري رحمه الله أن ستين ذراعاً إنما كانت مقدار قامة آدم عليه السلام في الجنّة، فلما نزل عنها عاد إلى القصر، ولم يزل أبناؤه يولدون بقرب من هذه القامة إلى يومنا الآن، وإنما يرجعون إلى أصل قامتهم حينما يعودون إلى الجنّة. فقوله عليه السلام: ""لم يزل ينقص"": معناه: أنه لم يزل يولد ناقصاً، والله سبحانه وتعالى أعلم  “It does not mean the height of people has not ceased decreasing with every generation, rather it means the human body has not ceased to be imperfect thereafter. This is taken from what has reached us from the teacher of our teachers (Anwar Shah) al-Kashmiri, may Allah have mercy on him, that sixty hands was the height of Adam in the Paradise and when he fell from it he became short and to this day of ours his children have not ceased to be on almost the same (short) height. And they will return to their original height when they go back to Paradise. So the saying of Prophet (May peace be upon him), ""they have not stopped being short"" means that have they not stopped being born imperfect i.e. on the same short height. Allah the Perfect and Almighty knows best!”[3]   Simply put in the Paradise Adam’s height was 60 cubits however on Earth it was reduced from its original perfect height and it continues that way to this day. However, when humans will eventually return to Paradise they will attain the same height.  This not only gives the plain and unproblematic interpretation of the last phrase it also tells us that Adam’s height seized to be 60 cubits after his landing on the Earth.  Indeed Allah knows the best!  -- by Waqar Akbar Cheema  [1] Al-Qurtubi, Abu al-Abbas, al-Mufhim lima Ashkala fi Talkhis Kitab Muslim, 23/45 [2] Al-Kashmiri, Anwar Shah, Fayd al-Bari, Vol.6 p.5 [3] Usmani, Muhammad Taqi, Takmila Fath al-Mulhim, Vol.6, p.158   Formatting by your humble correspondent Hakim =P"

I mean like, I believe that human evolution to be true because of the evidence we have of it. However, most scholar say that we shouldn't accept human evolution to be true but evolution for animals is okay.   What doesn't make sense to me about this position is why Allah (swt) create humans exclusively instead of just using evolution? Why would Allah (swt) make it seem that human evolution took place if it actually didn't? Shouldn't there be some evidence of it rather than the opposite to be true?  And I'm not saying I don't believe on miracles. I do. However, I think there should be evidence of Adam being directly created."

Muslims, I think, will have 2 main contentions in the evolutionary framework 1) Spontaneous generation 2) Some forms of macro evolution (23 chromosomal Homo sapiens specifically).  Other than that, don't Muslims having a problem studying biology. It's actually an encouraging sign that medicine seems to be very prevalent career choice in the Muslim world."

This is one of the reasons that some of the early arabs accepted Islam, Arabs were poets and liguists and they could instantly recognise that Quran was not something that a normal man would say but is a revelation of a much higher power. The verses of the Quran are very distinctive, and they are very different than regular poetry prevalent at the time, and completely different from regular speech.  For the history of revelation, ordering of the Quran, and the collection of the holly book, please refer to the following:  Preservation of the Quran (part 1 of 2): Memorization  Preservation of the Quran (part 2 of 2): The Written Quran  You can also read this as it contains a little more details about the collection of the Quran during the lifetime of Mohammed PBUH  The collection and compilation of the Quran- Part 1: During the Lifetime of the Prophet"
islam,3dkdxr,SalamToAll,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:04:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the links!! This is what I was looking for.   If i may, what about the charge that since there was no standardized Arabic in the 7th century, the reason the Quran is said to transcend all linguistic rules is because it is the very text on which modern Standard Arabic was subsequently based on? Like, it literally became the foundation stone for the language and formalized it?   It also becomes harder to really know what other poetry was up against with the Quran because I've heard we have very scant remnants of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry? (might not be correct, aren't the Thousand and One Nights pre-Islam?)  The thing is I'm not a native speaker, so I have to go through transliterations; understandably, none of them really wow me, linguistically or stylistically. I just kind of read through it and... That's it. So the argument from beauty always falls really flat for me. It could be beautiful, but that would be subjective and I wouldn't know it from any other recitation in Arabic, unfortunately."

You might have only read a Juz, but why not make it a habit to finish a Juz every month going forward? You might have only learned one surah, but why not learn a new Surah every month going forward?   Also, remember there is still the 6 fasts of Shawwal, why not use the momentum you've gained from Ramadaan and fast all 6, so it's as if you've fasted the entire year?  It's not too late, you can still make Ramadaan count."

Once that's stable, move onto voluntary acts."

They make big plans for Ramadan, and then they find they don't have the energy or willpower to follow through. It's hard, especially when Ramadan is in summer like this and the days are so long and you're struggling just to get enough sleep. I was thinking about this exact thing just now, reading that Eid is supposed to be tomorrow and I feel disappointed with myself. I was hoping I had one more day.  But you know? /u/spiderthunder is right. Just because Ramadan is over doesn't mean you don't have any more opportunities to improve your deen. That should be a continual process for your entire life. We are all struggling with this in different ways. Try your best in the upcoming year, and see if you are in a better place when Ramadan starts next year insha'Allah."

I advise you fast on the weekends of the coming month as that will likely be easier for you.   Repent to Allah for the prayers you missed and make intention to pray regularly; neglected prayers represent a danger far greater than missed blessings.  The beautiful thing about this month is that we still have time to acquire its blessings, we can complete our fasts at any time. If you feel you are in loss, then work from that feeling to gain what you are missing."

Maybe Allah will allow me to live until another Ramadhan and maybe I might die before then. Only Allah knows. At the same time Allah knows what's in my heart and whats in your heart. It is said in Sunnah, when someone makes an intention for a good deed, they are rewarded regardless of doing the  good deed or not. Likewise, when one intents to something bad and doesn't do it, he is rewarded for refraining. It is also said that Allah's mercy outweighs His wrath. I ask Allah to forgive out sins due to ignorance, arrogance, and laziness and give us the ability to become better from this very moment on. Amen."

If there's no deeper essence to these things then what are these things but physical actions? What separates man from machine? A machine can say ""eid mubarak"" and bow down towards mecca exponentially more times than a man ever could in his entire life. But a machine will never be able to understand the deeper realities to these things - beauty, repentence, love etc. They're just words but they change the entire game.   If ramadan to you is just a game where the objective is to ""do x, do y, do z etc"" then you've missed the point, you haven't come to an understanding of the deeper reality of ramadan, and this applies to life as well.   Its not about being that guy who says ""subhanallah"" 1000 times every day, says ""salam"" every time he sees a dude with a beard and prays 7 times a day(counting witr and tahajjud lol). It's about being the guy who does these things with a deeper understanding of their realities. This is the man who has transformed his self. One who doesn't understand the deeper realities has not transformed himself for a human being is not a set of physical actions.   Its not a waste so long as you walk the path towards understanding."

By itself I do not think it is haram in the same way that alcohol is by itself haram, however there are too many times when it becomes an interference to all kinds of ibadaah and therefore becomes haram. This is all the more true when one uses it regularly.   If you are still unsure; make a promise (to yourself, not to Allah, for you may break your word) that you will not use it at times when it can interfere with your prayers and ibadaah (jummah, sawm ect). If you find you are able to do this, mashallah.   However I believe you will find that there is no way to combine a regular cannabis habit and pure ibadaah. One will always infringe upon the other, and the muslim is not one to allow anything to infringe on his ibadaah.   May Allah guide you and I rightly, and forgive me if I have spoken erroniously."

islam,3dks4x,abulbaraa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"Question and Answer from Islamic Web (Arabic Version of the site) Prohibition of Congratulation a Day or two Days before the Eid Prayer.   Question:  It’s spread between the people via modern means of social communication (media) in these days and ages that it is not permissible  greetings and blessings (congratulating each other)  before the festival of Eidu al-Fitrah or Eidu Al-Adha before the Eid’s (festival) prayer, so is this correct? Is there proof  against the permissible or without permissible of this action. May you advice me and may Allah reward you.  Answer:  All praise is for Allah, and blessing, and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah and his family and his companions, concerning what follows: For we do not stand against the proof that prohibits congratulation before the Eid’s prayer, it came in an answer from Shaykh Utheymeen may Allah have mercy upon him:  “Congratulation with the Eid, indeed congratulating  happen from some of the companions may Allah be pleased with them. Suppose that congratulating did not take place, so indeed congratulating is now from the normal affairs  which are from the people habits, congratulating each other reaching Eid and completing the fast and standing for prayers.”  So the Shaykh he made it from the affairs which congratulation is the customs of the people, with reaching Eid and completing the fast…..  It was asked to the Eminence Shaykh Alamah (learnt Scholar) Salih al Fawzan may Allah preserve him –  question’s text – :  “Spread between the people in these days, messages from the cell phones implicating the prohibition of congratulation with Eid  a day or two days  before the Eid and that it is bidah (innovation in the religion of Islam), so your Eminence what is your opinion? Shaykh Salih al Fawzan’s answer: I do not know this speech, those spreading it, neither do I know of its origin, so the congratulation is permitted on the day of Eid and the day after Eid is permitted. Concerning before the day of Eid, neither do I know that it took place this congratulation (of each other) from the salaf that they did not congratulate before the day of Eid, how do one congratulate each other and it did not happen yet (the event), the  congratulation (of each other)  be on the day of Eid or the day after Eid, with that also there is no evidence against it…. ”     It is clear from some of the present narrations about congratulation that some of the salaf they did it after Salah (the Eid’s prayer ), so very  came in al-Mugna of Ibn Qadamah he said:  and mention Ibn Aqeel about  the Eid’s congratulation the hadeeths related to it: that Muhammad son of Ziyaad, he said:  I was with Abu Amaamah al-Bahile and other than him from the companions of the Prophet sallahu wa alayhi wa salam and that was known when they return from the Eid he said to one another: تقبل الله منا و منكم taqabala-llahu mina wa minkum may Allah accept from us and all of you, and Ahmed said the hadeeth chain Abu Amaamah narration is good. Also  said Ali son of Thabit said, I asked Maalik son of Anas since thirty five years, and he continues to say it is know in al Madinah.  In the Sunan al-Bayhaqe: related to Khalid son of Mudaan he said: I meet Wathilah son of Alasqa’ on the day of Eid and I said:  تقبل الله منا و منك  may Allah accept from us and you and he said: نعم تقبل الله منا و منك  yes may Allah accept from us and from you, he said Wathilah:  I meet the Messenger of Allah sallahu wa alyhi salam the day of Eid so I said تقبل الله منا و منك may Allah accept from us and you, and so he said: نعم تقبل الله منا و منك  yes may Allah accept from us and you.

To be honest, questions of religion in general didn't come to my mind often. I started practicing recently (alhamdulilah) and it still didn't occur to me that I might be doing something haram. I'm baffled it didn't. It just hit me after seeing this that from an Islamic perspective, the money I've been earning might as well have come from selling drugs or some similarly unlawful activity.   I'm definitely going to look into it, but thankfully I'm leaving this job soon either way."

Ibrahim perhaps took all things into consideration and was obliged by morality to obey God and kill his son. Perhaps the moral of the story is not ""obey God no matter what"" but rather ""make the right decision"".   Hence the maxim of Ibrahim would have been to do the right thing as opposed to ""obey God absolutely"". And that serves as a plausible answer. And so rather than ""you should always obey God"" we derive ""you should always do the right thing, obedience to God has a high stature amongst moral action""."

islam,3dkj1w,turkeyfox,7,Fri Jul 17 01:11:05 2015 UTC,Well thats a basic tenant of faith that God is the Most Merciful the Most Just. So why would the most just do unjustice. Allah himself said that He made it unlawful for himself to be unjust.

Rather it is because there is a concept that is outside of God which is the concept of ""justice"". It is by God following in line with the idea of justice that he thus becomes just."
islam,3dkj1w,Unhombremusulman,2,Fri Jul 17 01:27:20 2015 UTC,Justice is a relative word that has no true meaning.  It's subjective and as straight forward as a stream. So when it comes down to it the only objective view of it is from God. Unless your God your views are always going to be biased. And also. God made this world. Whatever he wants is justice. God is above truth evil good bad.  Since they all are what he says. These only apply to man and not even angels. Like code. Sims are limited to code written in the game. And the coder is above the code since he made it. So just as binary has no true affect on the real world. The laws of this world don't affect God. God can kill because  he gave life as a loan. A person who is given a loan can't complain when it's asked back. But even with this Allah chose to give us innate correct morality. And he himself limited himself ( because Only God can limit himself ) to that innate morality in us. He doesn't have to be just (by our definition which he gave us) be he chooses to anyway. Thus glorifying his own majesty. Also when  hell and heaven exist who cares? Right. Do what ever to be in eternal bliss. But he made it so only those who deserve hell  go their.
islam,3dkj1w,Butt-Pain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:01:45 2015 UTC,"You've given a certain model of justice and said it's a basic tenant of belief in God without giving evidence as to why. You also said that God is Most Just and proceeded to to say Justice is meaningless, pick one."
islam,3dkj1w,tupendous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:03:06 2015 UTC,"You've given a certain model of justice and said it's a basic tenant of belief in God without giving evidence as to why.    If you believe in God. Than that's the proof. Since it comes as a package. If an omnipotent being exists. Than his judgement is the best. It's one in the same. The Proof for that is the Quran. At the beginning of Every Surah (except Tawba) and basically on every page.   You also said that God is Most Just   Which is true.    proceeded to to say Justice is meaningless, pick one.   It's meaningless when WE define it. Since OUR morality is built in from the truths that God set on Earth. Every society knows not to steal not to lie and so on. That's built in because that what the omnipotent being that created the universe by his design said theses are the rules Universe works with the best and are like the optimized setting for society. And we swore ourselves that we believe in this in front of God all at the same time (story of Adam as). So Morality is what God sets in US the human beings. The basic rules so that even if were lost we can at least have some sort of civility. Now if it comes from God himself. Than any that apposes God wouldn't be Moral. Since morality like Air Water the laws of Physics are FROM GOD. So saying God is unjust is like saying that this text book says that Physics should be like this. And if the real world isn't like that the real world physics isn't real. NO. it's the textbook that wrong since the Authors based it off of the real world not the other way around. But being All Powerful God can do whatever and it would be by definition just. Like create people with no skin so that they suffer their whole lives. Since were just creation Allah/God can do whatever and be in the right. BUT and here's the BIG THING. Allah himself doesn't want to do that. Because he himself is also not just the Most Powerful and the Creator. He's also the MOST JUST. So just like acknologing the fact that God can know everything you also acknowledge he's the Most Just since he said it himself. By accepting the Quran you accept ALL 99 attributes of God on one go. Deny one and you deny Islam. So all you have to do Is Disprove Islam or Believe it. Thats the dichotomy.  It's like if the Base of the Religion the Quran is true the pillars are there. But if there is no base than no pillars. And the pillars ONLY come with the base. So why go one by one? Just see if theirs a base thus there are pillars. So Islam is true and God is the Most Just. Or it isn't and He isn't the Most Just. Simple as that. By being Muslim you believe God to be Just since what we know about God CAN ONLY COME FROM GOD HIMSELF. Since no other being has the knowledge of God's Attributes UNLESS GOD himself told that person. And since one of his attributes are the Most Just. HE WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE TO DO WRONG. Since that's not an Attribute of God. He's above petty things like these."
islam,3dkj1w,ThisIsOwnage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:29:05 2015 UTC,"Saying there's a concept ""outside of God"" is placing a limit on God, meaning He's not really God after all.

islam,3dkj1w,SalamToAll,-3,Fri Jul 17 01:09:51 2015 UTC,"I find this absolutely ridiculous at face level for it implies that somehow God could command us to rape each other and that would somehow make rape be something beautiful and noble to do. I could say more but it suffices for now to say that the idea is seemingly ridiculous.  You would have to justify your statement for me to take you seriously. What then is your justification that ""goodness"" or ""beauty"" is derived from God simply saying ""thou shalt rape thy children""?"
islam,3dkj1w,CinderellaMan111,7,Fri Jul 17 01:06:47 2015 UTC,Why would God ever tell you to rape someone?
islam,3dkj1w,arguingtruth,7,Fri Jul 17 01:13:30 2015 UTC,but he doesn't...what kind of idiotic argument is that. Allah(swt) has sent down the final shari'ah. There are no new laws. The laws we have in existence are the only ones that will exist until the end of the world. So thinking of such ridiculous hypotheticals is a complete waste of time.

islam,3dhaui,theREALpootietang,17,Thu Jul 16 07:13:29 2015 UTC,"They seem to be less something being revealed, more of something that is being created in response to specific events.   This is not a contradiction to the Quran being uncreated. What did happen and will happen has been predetermined by Allah, i.e., He knows all. Therefore, when Allah revealed certain verses in response to certain events, both the verses and the events have been predetermined and so the verses are not being ""created"".   These verses seem petty to be the eternal, uncreated words of the Creator of the Universe.   Actually these verses have important lessons for all, which is why they are part of the Quran. The condemnation of Abu Lahab serves as a reminder to us all. The marriage of the Prophet to Zaynab carries important legal rulings in Islam about dealing with matters such as marriage, adoption, inheritance, and kinship.   I don't mean any disrespect at all, I'm just trying to understand. If anybody could help shed light on this issue, I'd much appreciate it.   Of course!   Are there any other good books you recommend I read?   Actually, I can recommend a YouTube series on the biography (""seerah"") of the Prophet (pbuh). I've found the series to be very good in contextualizing and explaining what life was like at that time, in that society, in terms of our modern lifestyle."

Son of Abu Dawood the muhaddith that gave us much of Islamic information and the scholars of the 4 madhabs have this opinion. Based off the fact that since Allah knows the future that means Allah knows the Quran and what's in it since forever. The Quran  is part of Allah's knowledge thus is eternal

It was the dominant opinion (thanks to the mihnah, it was forbidden to have a different opinion, Imam Hanbal even got flogged and imprisoned for reaffirming the orthodox dogma of the uncreated Quran) until the caliphate of Al-Mutawakkil where it was condemned and declined rapidly (in favor of the ash'ari theology).

islam,3dhaui,AskYous,2,Thu Jul 16 14:20:48 2015 UTC,Is their a difference?  Eternal and uncreated? Seems like they both mean the same thing
islam,3dhaui,placewhereusernameis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"I was confused about this also. I thought uncreated does imply eternal, but was confused. But once I started reading on this subject, it turned out that the Qur`aan is uncreated, yet not eternal.  I couldn't find the original source where I read it, but I found something else that is beneficial:  'Aamir ibn Deenaar said:   ""I have met the people during seventy years, all of them saying, 'Allaah is the Creator and everything other than Him is created - except the Qur'an. For it is certainly the Speech of Allaah, not created. From Him, it began, and to Him it will return.'"" - 'Aqeedah Hamawiyyah of Ibn Taymiyyah by Sheikh ibn 'Uthaymeen, page 57.

islam,3dhaui,AskYous,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:09:30 2015 UTC,"I think if you look at the two meanings given of the phrase ""and to Him it will return"" on page 58, it doesn't contract the Quran being uncreated/eternal. Uncreated and eternal are one and the same. Something uncreated did not have a beginning nor will it have an end in this case since it is an attribute of Allah (His Speech) and Allah is eternal, so the Quran is eternal. The beginning and returning mentioned here is not of the existence of the Quran, but rather to its presence in this world."

Abu Lahab was condemned by Allah, so all he needed to do was to accept Islam and thus he would be forgiven his previous sins and been given a fresh slate so to speak - so the people would have said how can he be condemned when he has accepted Islam so the Quran and the Prohpet SAW would have been brought into question.    I am no scholar and I am paraphrasing what has been said elsewhere so please forgive me if I am wrong and Allah knows best   (The Qur'an declared Abu Lahab and his wife dwellers of the Hellfire.

islam,3dimke,shadowq8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:28:47 2015 UTC,"The caliphate is the result of many incidents leading to the formation of islam, the changing structure of Arab tribes and outside threats and relations. Like many ""states"" (you should use this loosely when referring to that time) it formed for a plethera of reasons and historically not exactly like the common narrative explains, because that narrative is after the fact.   I don't have credentials in Islamic or Arabic history, which will give you more context than you need. You should check out /r/AskHistorians. Ask your question there like ""Why did the Caliphate form after Mohammed and what caused it to form"" and you add disclaimers to give you more descriptions like ""what is the difference in the state formation of the Islamic Empire versus Rome"" and so on.   My very simple answer is that the community was centralized back then like many communities. The state forms due to variables outside and inside its controls. Through the general nature of politics, remember it was a state not a house that holds the religion, land grabbing and politiking took place and a fully funchioning state was formed. Not to mention the history of the Islamic Empire is muddied very quickly after Mohammed died with conflicts among dynasties, academics, regional rulers. Just like any state. Someone might give you a religious reason like ""it was all back then"" but state functions in reality as the occur are all about politics not religion. The narrative exists after the fact. Its kind of like pan-arabism or pan-islamism. My only source to be clear is Albert Hourani's The Arabs. Again, please check out AskHistorians."

The Ummah is the community comprised of all Muslims. Anyone and everyone who has accepted Islam are a part of it, united by an identity and a strong bond that transcends all colours, tribes, nations and continents. We feel the pain when it strikes and the joy when it comes, even though we may not be the ones directly afflicted by it.  In my opinion, the best way to understand it is living it. However that's impossible for a non-Muslim. A way of trying to explain it could be by helping the Muslims in other parts of the world who are in need, showing the siblinghood that exists."

Abu Sinaan (rahimahullaah, died 132H) said:  I said to Sa’eed b.

islam,3dhboc,faiUjexifu,7,Thu Jul 16 19:52:52 2015 UTC,"There are some scholars who think you shouldn't initiate a salam to a non-Muslim, but I think everyone's pretty much in agreement that it's good to respond based on this verse:  Qur'an 4:86: http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=4&verse=86   And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet [in return] with one better than it or [at least] return it [in a like manner]. Indeed, Allah is ever, over all things, an Accountant.   Notice there's nothing here suggesting this is only for Muslims. It makes a lot of sense because you wouldn't necessarily know if someone who salams you is Muslim or not, anyway.  Anyway, here's an article that goes into more depth, if you're interested: http://www.virtualmosque.com/islam-studies/rules-of-greeting-non-muslims-in-islam-saying-salaamreplying-salaam-bynurideen-lemu-an-nigeri/"

islam,3dhboc,zeeginganinja,3,Thu Jul 16 21:34:03 2015 UTC,"This is a really good point. Being rude to people (not returning salam) just because you assume they are not Muslim is inexcusable. Actually, even if you know they're not Muslim, it's inexcusable. I really wish people wouldn't do this."
islam,3dhboc,plabadajan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:29:36 2015 UTC,"In Egypt, Christians and Muslims say it to one another all the time. Regardless of how many clashes they had. There is nothing wrong with it. Perhaps your friend is a little too extremist or just not knowledgeable in the religion. Islam spread mainly because manners and kindness. So what does your friend recommend that you say? Or does he suggest to ignore the greeting because it's rude. When non-Muslims say it, they say it with respect towards you and your religion. They know that this is how people greet one another. I live in a Jewish community and my neighbors greet me with Salam. Never hold back on saying something kind to another person, and that includes wishing them peace."

Someone asked this very question, is it wrong to point your feet towards the qiblah? The imam said no. Then he paused. ""Wait, in your culture, is it considered disrespectful to point your feet towards your parents?"" The person's like, ""Well yeah, I wouldn't sit at home with my feet pointed towards my parents."" So the imam said, ""Allah is more worthy that you show His signs respect. For you, it is not allowed to point your feet towards the Ka'bah because in your culture, it is a sign of disrespect.""  This topic has come up quite a bit in the last few days. This is a great example of how culture can indeed shape Shari'ah rulings."
islam,3dg77s,AnotherParaclete,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:12:43 2015 UTC,He said for you not to do that. Not due to it being haram; but rather because it is disrespectful to others in certain situations. Such as if you are in a mosque with a large sum of people and you stretch out your legs and people see your nasty and smelly feet yum yum.

islam,3dg77s,Wuiji,2,Thu Jul 16 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"Pointing your feet towards something/someone is considered a sign of disrespect.   If you go out of way to make a change for the benefit of another, it is often appreciated.   So, surely, changing the direction you sleep in as a sign of respect for Allah is a positive change. Not making the change isn't negative, but making the change is harmless to you and may earn you brownie points in the eyes of Allah.  Also, are you living in his house right now, or the other way round? If it's the former then it's basic common courtesy to go along with the way the household does things as long as it doesn't go against Islam.  There's nothing wrong in what you've done or said though, and you appear to have handled the situation in a mature manner thus far."

I live in his house so of course i accomodate his rules but some of them arent mubah if you get what im saying so i cant accomodate everything
islam,3dg77s,possumpersi,0,Thu Jul 16 06:24:51 2015 UTC,"You are well within your rights to not go along with everything, if it goes against the Quran/Sunnah/Hadith then you shouldn't feel an obligation to follow.   The issue that a lot of the older generations of Muslims have is that they tend to believe that people younger than them can't possibly know more about aspects of Islam than they do. So even if you sit down with your uncle and explain your stances on certain aspects about the way you practice and back them up with valid sources, there's no guarantee that he will go along with it. It's an issue that seems quite predominantly Subcontinental."

islam,3dgsda,plabadajan,3,Thu Jul 16 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"what was the historical context for prohibiting intentional vomiting?   Others can correct me if I am wrong, but pretty sure the vomit part is not something specific. When we fast, we don't put anything in the throat like food, gum and so on, and when a person vomits intentionally they usually swallow something in the process.   So its more of the same reason as not eating, and its not like people use to throw up as a cultural habit or something. Hope that made sense, peace."
islam,3dgsda,Fairresponse,2,Thu Jul 16 03:54:53 2015 UTC,It's based on a hadith reported by Abu Dawood and Tirmidhi which specifically mentions the intentional vomiting. I didn't find any mention of an historical context to that.

But yea, Em, and lots of rap music doesn't always rely on perfect rhyme as the sole source to make the song flow.    You are making a poem and not a song, so it is different I guess.  As for words, it sorta depends on the flow of the poem?  You could possibly use any phrase that ends in ""in"", i.e. Muslim -> ""pushed in"" or something.  I don't think it has to exactly be one word.  Also, if it is spoken word, who is to say you can't adjust how a word is spoken.

None of us is qualified to give rulings concerning your case, we can only give you our opinions and you're just going to listen to the one that appease your heart. On top of that, we don't know you (what's your current situation, how strong is your iman, what does your family say about it, etc.) and we don't know her (does she have an interest for Islam, is she ok raising your kids with an islamic education etc.)  So yep, just go to any masjid and tell your story to the imam there, he'll be more than happy to answer you or redirect you to someone with more knowledge."
islam,3det3d,InMemoryOf,25,Wed Jul 15 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"Ibn al-Qayyim (Rahimahullah) narrated:  It is reported that in Egypt, there was a man who would maintain the mosques, making the call to prayer, etc. He was, by all outward means, an obedient person and devout worshipper.  One day, as he usually would, he ascended the minaret to make the call to prayer. At the base of the minaret, there was a Christian woman standing. He saw her, and was seduced by her looks. So, he descended the minaret, went to her, and entered her home. She said to him: “Who are you, and what do you want?”  He replied: “I want you.”  She said: “Why?”  He said: “You have enslaved my eyes, and you have captured my heart.”  She said: “I will never answer your desire in a doubtful or suspicious manner.”  He said: “Ok, so, I will marry you, then.”  She said: “You are a Muslim, and I am a Christian. My father will never allow me to marry you.”  He said: “So, I will become a Christian.”  She said: “If you wish to do so, go ahead.“  So, the man became a Christian in order to marry this woman, and lived with the woman’s family in her house. Later on that day, however, he was on the roof of the house. He fell from the roof and died without even having enjoyed his new bride. So, he lost the woman, and he lost his religion.”  Ad-Da’ wad-Dawa, page.127 of Ibn Al-Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah (Rahimahullaah)  Thus, do not give into ways of her religion and don't practice what she does and your children are to follow Islam. Do not go into the church. If you want to get married then do it islamically. Go in a masjid. Cease sinning now with the ""dating"" You're doing now and get married.

Most people take offence but the people that overcome that are in my opinion the best. The majority of every religion is good. A small minority of each is weird and an even smaller minority is messed up. The fact that some religions have restrictions on marriage is messed up. Because I am a Buddhist I cannot marry a Muslim? I dunno."
islam,3det3d,SERFBEATER,3,Thu Jul 16 02:50:53 2015 UTC,There's a huge difference between critique and down right disrespect/demonizing.
islam,3det3d,trojan_paris,-1,Thu Jul 16 02:54:01 2015 UTC,"How is it disrespectful to say it's dumb that interfaith marriages don't work? How is it demonizing to call out that hatred of gay marriage because a being you can't even know says it bad? Those are literally the only two things I've complained about in this sub for a long time. I gave up on trying to correct your guys misunderstandings of scientific topics related to my speciality in biology, not physics or chemistry. You didn't like it so I stopped. If you've ever forgotten I was one of the few non Muslims here defending this subreddit and Muslims when the Charlie Hebdo attacks occurred. My phones background is the minimalist wallpaper made by a user here for Surah 3 ayat 13. But you can continue to call me a Muslim or Islam hater if you want. When in reality all I've ever done is try to bring people closer together. Some users have apologized to me days after an argument or debate saying they were too harsh. Why even apologize the people we were then don't exist. But an apology is made and forgiveness is granted because that's what I do. I often end my posts with Metta, a Buddhist sign of thanks. Sometimes I say Jazakallah khair and I wished my Muslim friends Ramadan mubarak. I respond to those who treat me well here with a my friend, or namaskar meaning I literally bow to you. I work my ways up the Brahmaviharas slowly so that I can eventually do this to everyone friend or foe. The only reason I constantly say I'm Buddhist is because this sub asked me to. I don't want to mislead people. I've defended the Rohingya when no one else has and I've wrote papers on Israeli persecution of the Palestinians. But you can continue to call me and my actions whatever you want... because our two religions share a very similar story of how misinterpreting the character of a person doesn't reflect poorly on that individual but rather on themselves.  Take a breather and have some Metta"

Also please don't patronize me by saying how you 'defend' Muslims and 'stand-up' for them. If you really did, you wouldn't be complaining about it on here.

islam,3det3d,trojan_paris,0,Thu Jul 16 03:13:19 2015 UTC,Calm down? Haha I've literally been calm until you call me out on this. I don't care about downvotes or whatever. It's a forum and you have every right to defend your position. I have enough going on in my life right now. Like fucking hell I do it to look good. I defended Islam because it was the right thing to do. If I wanted to look good to this sub I would just give the same circlejerk responses that get up voted everytime. If I wanted to swoon the Muslimahs with my knowledge of Islam I'd join the MSA at university. But I don't. I'm not part of the Buddhist society either. Intention is everything in both of our religions. So when I defend homosexuals do I do it because I want to make you look like shit? No. Do I do it because I want to look good to the atheists who stop by? No. I do it cause it's the right thing to fucking do. It's just like it's your duty as a Muslim to give dawaah and to correct people's wrong views of your religion. Give me a break. Go learn about something that isn't yourself for once. And instead of publicly shaming me like you said I apparently do to make good have a nice pm conversation like some of your brothers and sisters do.
islam,3det3d,SERFBEATER,-1,Thu Jul 16 03:29:51 2015 UTC,"First of all, plz refrain from cursing, it adds unnecessary tension and distastefulness to a discussion. I think it's unfair to call /r/islam a circle jerk since we do often have various dissenting and diverse opinions, and it makes sense since there is diversity in Islam. Stop and consider, is the right thing to do the right thing to do? Then consider if you even know what the 'right' thing to do is. Your post that I replied to still comes off as very patronizing, where you say ""I gave up on trying to correct your guys misunderstandings of scientific topics related to my speciality in biology, not physics or chemistry. You didn't like it so I stopped. If you've ever forgotten I was one of the few non Muslims here defending this subreddit and Muslims when the Charlie Hebdo attacks occurred."" You claim we have misunderstandings about science but we are a diverse community filled with science lovers and haters. And why should it matter if you defended Muslims during Charlie Hebdo, there was never a legitimate reason to hate Muslims in the first place. Would you hold it on a rape victim that they should be grateful you defended them? You come off as a type of person who would say ""I'm not racist, my best friend is black."" Brother, arrogance is no virtue, and historically has been the downfall of many. May Allah  guide you to the straight path, and have a happy Ramadan and Eid."

Yes there are geologists here, doctors and so on. But I don't claim to understand plate tectonics just as a neurosurgeon shouldn't claim to understand evolution. Honestly you come off as more patronizing. But alas it isn't a pissing competition so we'll have to leave that there. I know what is right because it is a quality instilled in every human. I don't give a flying crap if you're grateful I defend your faith on the Internet and in person. I'm just pointing out you don't know who I am. I love all races, all genders, all religions, all orientations, everyone. I love all people, even the rotten apples. Because its what is right. You talk down to me like a child and say I am arrogant. I appreciate the blessing but it'd be better if you actually meant it. My worst fear is that I lose compassion for a certain demographic because of people like you. You know why a lot of people dislike rednecks or Roma or travelers? It's because the rotten few make it look bad.   Honestly I hope you're filled with happiness. Metta.

islam,3det3d,SERFBEATER,6,Thu Jul 16 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"I don't really have the information to answer your main questions, but just an FYI - there are a lot of churches that don't allow weddings where one partner is not Christian, and others will make the non-Christian partner promise to raise the kids Christian. If you're looking to get married in a Catholic Church, for example, you're pretty much out of luck.  But that really brings up an important issue, and one that you need to think about before you get married - what are you going to do once you have kids? This is something you need to discuss with her and come to a solution you can both be happy with. And if you can't, you need to reconsider the wedding. It's better to give up a relationship now rather than to wait until you have kids and get a divorce because you can't agree on important things."
islam,3det3d,plabadajan,13,Wed Jul 15 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"Dating itself in Islam is not a thing. Yes I know some Muslims are doing the ""dating"" thing, but in reality is haram. Marrying a non-Muslim is not a good idea and her converting just to ""appease"" your family is equally terrible or worse.   I think you need to take step back and do some research first about marriage. It seems to me you are not ready to get married. Marriage is more than just a contract, it is a responsibility for the both of you. She has rights on you and you have rights on her. There are things in a marriage you have to be ready for and in Islam you need your parents permission.  Even if you get it to work, down the road you are going to face a lot of problems. People will cut her out of the family for marrying you, they will hate or resent you for converting their daughter, they will no understand the religion or culture, and they will fight to bring her back to their side. Wosrt of all your kids will have an identity crisis and be subjected to the constant civil war in your home. And divorce in this country is a mess."

We always want to make sure our parents approve of the groom/bride. But, you still make the decision. Don't know about the whole marrying a non Muslim thing. But, if 2 Muslims wanted to get married and your mother doesn't want you two to marry because of their race for example, then you should get married anyways. If parents don't really have a valid excuse to prevent you from marrying, then you make the decision."

His children, my cousins are no longer Muslim and are now atheist. It brings me pain because I love my cousins but they don't care for Islam anymore.

The Bollywood film PK had this exact ending.  And then later he says   No one celebrates a white Christian woman marrying Amir Khan the Pakistani-American doctor, no, he’s stealing that white woman, but when Amira Khan, the Pakistani-American doctor marries a white Christian man, she’s open and progressive.   But there was another Bollywood movie called Lagaan, where a white Christian lady falls in love with the Muslim character played by actor Aamir Khan. Ooops :)  These were both wildly popular movies by the way."

Not as if the same Bollywood creates irreligious or extremist caricature of Muslimss regularly, and has for decade. Besides, outliers don't form a basis for any comprehensive analysis. But like I said, you find this phenomenon more in the West than anything. Regardless, the main points on the incompatibility between Muslims/non-Muslims romantically should be the key take-away."
islam,3det3d,K_M_H_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:19:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, obviously the takeaway is still a sound one. I just wanted to point this out because while Bollywood may not be the West, it's pretty popular in the West and it has a degree of influence. At least PK was the highest grossing Bollywood film overseas in history.  But yeah, outliers aren't the norm. I get that. And interfaith marriages aren't always the easiest, I understand that too. All in all, he makes good points :)"
islam,3det3d,justamuslimguy,9,Thu Jul 16 18:46:27 2015 UTC,As someone who's been in your shoes before heed my advice and the others. Stop and break things off they won't get far and if they do its a very slim chance things will work out for the following reasons.   She will take on a great burden teaching the kids Islam which she may or may not agree to. Even if you teach they will still question why she doesn't and so on. Just because she converts doesn't mean she will convert from her own heart of her own free will but only to please you which will end in misery for both of you. Should you Not choose to have kids then it'll be a sin on you. If you adopt well thats a tough nut in itself.   Ultimately make dua for her to become a pious muslim by herself and for herself. You never Allah may make it happen but again break it off and/or give her dawah and be mindful of what you do. u/xAsianZombie has a great quote that applies well here.

The husband is by no means entitled to deny her this inalienable right. It is, accordingly, incumbent upon both of them to reach mutual agreement regarding the practice of coitus interruptus or using contraceptives, otherwise, the husband will be sinful from the Islamic point of view and have committed an act contradicting the Shari`ah objectives if he does so on his own volition."

islam,3det3d,ProJoh,2,Wed Jul 15 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"Hi, Im an extremely strong proponent of NOT marrying outside your religion especially for Muslims. We take our religion very differently then others do.   Ive spoken about this issue in the past. I'll paste what I've discussed in another conversation.    Just like regular marriages in indo-pak culture, interfaith marriages are not guaranteed to succeed or fail. This marriage can make a very very strong person or just eat up your entire world. I have seen interfaith marriages from both perspectives. Muslim-guy/sikh-girl. Hindu-guy/Muslim-girl. I'll talk to about the Muslim-guy/sikh-girl. Muslim guy is my uncle. Very secular. Married an atheist Sikh girl 15 years ago. The sikh girl had to do the shahadah for the nikkah, but didn't really take it seriously but my uncle's family did and started calling her by the name that was given to her after her conversion. My uncle and my aunt are always always arguing. There has never been a time when I have not seen them arguing. Neither one of them wants to give in and compromise because to them it would mean, I'm giving in to the Muslims side or I'm giving in to the Sikh side. Naming the kids was a real pain. My aunt wanted Sikh 1st names, since Dad's last muslim name would be used. My uncle wanted Muslim name, no singh or Kaur stuff. They eventually got Muslim names, but It is very tough for my aunt. She doesn't know where she belongs any more, She will go with us on Jummah prayers, then on the way back she would stop at the local Gurdwara. I think she feels guilty for turning her back on the her parent's faith. The kids call themselves muslims, but they are really confused about their faith, they have phases of I'm a sikh, i'm an agnost, I feel like Allah is the real God. Things I have over heard my uncle complain about. His kids don't say Salamalaikum, because his wife doesn't. My uncle gets up for Ramadan fasts on his own, because his wife doesn't believe in fasting. My uncle keeps wanting to raise their children the way he was raised. My aunt kept wanting to raise them with sat sri kal, patka, and reciting the mool mantra. Because of this back and forth, these kids spend more time with each other and less with their parents. I know they are just waiting to get out of the house for college and never return. This is one type of Marriage. Hindu-guy/Muslim-girl. Like your Fiance, the muslim girl I know cares less about Islamic teaching when it comes to marriage. I've known this girl from the time I worked at Block-buster Video after highschool. So yes she marries Hindu dude, Guy is super chill, we hang out from time to time. They like visiting the guy's parents 2 times a week. Guys parents though were seemigly cool, they always would make real low key comments on muslims in general, about the whole terrorism, politics in india etc. My friend would feel uncomfy around the parents and did not want to go over to the parents; all the time. They started fighting, They get pregnant. The guy's mom comes over for a couple of days, and is doing all the hindu rituals for the newborn. My friend hated it, because if she isn't doing Muslim rituals, hindu rituals should not be done either. The guy becomes more and more religious, their 2 kids have very strong hindu names. They go to temple, the muslim girl doesn't want divorce as she left college for the guy and her family pretty much remained out of the whole marriage and affair. For fear of not being divorced she worships with the husband and the kids. The husband could not be happier and the wife could not be more miserable. Have you thought of what will you name your kids. Would you guys do any rituals. Muslims and Hindus SHave the baby's head. We do it preferably on the 7th day after birth. WE sacrifice Goats known as aqeeqah. Bro, This is a mistake. I don't doubt that your love for her and her love for you maybe way stronger and purer than most couple's. I don't doubt that she has found a best friend in you and you have found a fun loving partner in her. But the glitter of love gradually wears off after marriage. You both do not have a common ground. Unless you convert for good or she converts for good. You were raised with a certain set of values and so was she. VERY DIFFERENT VALUES. Islam is not just a religion. Muslims practice Islam from the time they get up in the morning to the time they go to sleep at night. There are prayers we recite when we wake up. When we enter/exit the bathroom. When we start/finish eating. when we leave/enter the house. Learning Arabic. Reciting Qur'an. 5 prayers. The Ramadan fasting. Would you be ok if she puts up Islamic Symbols in the house. Would she be OK if you put up, Krishna's moorti or painting in the house. Its not the big things that cause pain in interfaith marriages, its the build up of tiny little things that keeps adding up. You being the man would feel rejected alot. I mean alot, when your wife never agrees with you on anything. You guys will make sweeping compromises on the bigger things, because you want to remain truthful to your word you gave each other before marriage, but you both will also feel like you are doing a lot of things for the other person, so you will try to stand your ground on the smaller compromises, and these things will not let you sleep at night. ""I gave up this big thing for her, she can't even do this little thing for me"" she'll be thinking the same exact thing. You are right you guys are much more the just Hindu or Muslim. But Muslims don't believe there is anything more than being a muslim, but maybe your Fiance does, being more than your religion will try to save the marriage, but have 2 different religions will always be there and will always be this internal struggle with in the marriage. There comes a time when people stop looking at the bigger picture and let the everyday irritations consume them. She may not be practicing any of this right now. But after marriage when you see she is following somethings of her religion. You will want to seek refuge in what is inherent in you. Your values and your religion. Talking about God, She will say Allah and you will say Bhagwan/parmatma etc. You would want her to greet you with the hindu greeting, she would want you to greet her with Asalamualaikum. How would you feel if she was fasting in Ramadan but not during Karwa chauth or not keeping warut for you. Would you feel offended if she doesn't do pai lagoo to the elders or doesn't bow at the mandir. Would you go and pray with her at the mosque. Kids get your last name, but what kind of 1st names would they get, I have seen hindu-muslim couples use neutral 1st names like, sameer, raja, etc. It is important in the indo-pak culture that our wives have an endearing relationship with our parents. Would you wife be able to stay strong when your mom, doesn't see her as her own. You can't stop your parents from bad mouthing muslims infront of her, and she cant stop her parents. When you go over to her house, would you be able to eat with her family. Lets say you guys decide to raise your kids as Hindu. Will they really be hindu if mommy isn't a hindu and doesn't practice. After all kids are closest to their moms. When they ask you why doesn't mom go to the temple with us. What would you tell them. Bro, Marriage is suppose to bring peace to both individuals. But where would you find that, when you both are always looking to defend your respective sides and views. Men need their wives to believe in them and support them. Would you be able to handle that she doesn't because she can't separate supporting you from supporting your religion. Men, inherently look for qualities of their mothers in their spouses. Women, look for qualities of their fathers in their spouses. She will do nothing that your mom does, you won't do nothing that her father did. What if your wife wakes your kids for morning prayers and they are going to sunday school to learn Arabic. How would you react to that. How would your parents react to that. Seeing your wife and your mom not get along with tear you up inside. Not to mention the friend circle you guys will have. She will always have to defend you among the muslims about why you didn't convert and you will try to highlight similarities in her view and hindu views to your more religious friends. Dude the arguments will never end, She will make food the way Muslims make food and you would want her to make it, like your mom makes it. I have read many a posts in this and exmuslim sub about kids who hate their parents and do not know what religion they are related to. If not for anything I said. Think about the identity you are giving to your children. You guys probably have invested alot of time in this relationship and backing out now would mean all that time was wasted. Think of it this way, wasting away the REST OF YOUR LIFE, because of the time you have invested is worse. Please protect yourself and protect your fiance from life long arguments and agony. Have her read some of the posts in this sub, sit down and make a final informed decision. You both need to download this questionair and honestly answer them and discuss your answers with each other. https://adamscenter.org/files/PremaritalCounselingQuestionnaire.doc I looked through my history and found this. I don't know if this helps but, its pasted below. http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1igehs/nonmuslim_marriage_how_is_life_now/   Edit: op you should simply ask yourself. Do you love her enough to put her above Allah(swt) commands. Because marrying her would eventually put you in a position where your love and loyalty to your creator will be at odds with love and loyalty to your non Muslim wife.   PS: if she converts to appease your family. Have you considered how long would she have to carry the burden of this lie in front of your family. How long would you idaly stand by until you can't beat to see the person you love live a lie in front of your family."
islam,3det3d,Kami7,-2,Thu Jul 16 01:35:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, interfaith marriages can be hard sometimes, but in the end, love truly does conquer all. Romeo and Juliet will forever be a phenomenon in societies, and interfaith marriage is not such a large hardship that the benefit (fulfilling 1/2 your Deen, completing your love) is nullified."
islam,3det3d,trojan_paris,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:58:15 2015 UTC,"Romeo and Juliette was a fictional tale.   It really boils down to this. Can you carry your beliefs and your love together with out letting one take over the other.   If the person understands from the get go that, marrying outside of Islam means Its possible you and her will take away each other's rights in order to adhere to your own faiths and both party's realize that when one party adheres to their faith, that could potentially be taking away from the 2nd person's faith. Then sure, It won't be a fair marriage but people make silly self destructive choices.  If love is to prevail then both parties would have to abandon their own identities and their own world view, their core. You hold your lover more dear then your own beliefs and ideals. The same beliefs and ideals that make you the person your lover falls in love with. What are you then. Just a mirror of your lovers wants and needs.   OP will at one point deny his wife her rights, and his wife will at one point deny him his rights. Love alone carries no relationship.   His wife is a Christian, but Christians aren't recommended to circumcise their children and what if she really doesn't want this to happen to their boy. Someone's rights will be taken away, including that child's.   Op doesn't want their daughter to be a ballerina or wear yoga pants in public, but his wife really wants the daughter to enroll in Ballet, Someone will have to compromise.   She wants a statue of Jesus(pbuh) in the house, and according to his religion thats a no no, but now she won't let him put up Islamic symbols in the house. You think, constant giving and taking and struggling with how much of your identity should you give up for the person you love, is a healthy lifestyle?  Atleast to me its a no brainer. If a muslim involves themselves with a non muslims even in cases that are allowed, one should realize that a tough life is ahead.   The glitter of young love fades and is over taken by harsh realities of living with a person who is completely and utterly different than you. But now you have to make this work by sacrificing daily and nightly and ever so rightly."
islam,3det3d,Kami7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:32:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think Muslims should become a closed off community like Orthodox Jews. Our faith has always been about diversity and we were always allies of those with a different faith. Also, is it not true that Islamically, you cannot force your wife to conform to your faith, and that she is guaranteed freedom of religion? What's silly and destructive is choosing ease over love. Do we not bear hardships out of love for Allah ? I just think it's dangerous to not associate with non-Muslims. Yes, we should not adapt haraam ways they have, but we also should not close ourselves off to the good things they bring."
islam,3det3d,trojan_paris,3,Thu Jul 16 03:44:56 2015 UTC,"My brother, I love you as a Muslim and your heart is in the right place.   But I never said we cut ourselves off from others, we keep relations with everybody. We work with non Muslims, we keep long lasting friendships with them, we invite them in our homes and we celebrate with them. Here specifically we're discussing marriage.   I'm not saying love isn't important, what I'm saying is love isn't the only important thing. I hope we as a community can understand and appreciate that.   As Muslims our 1st duty is to Allah(swt) because its he who gives us the rights and responsibilities between our relationships including marriage.   Even for Muslims amongst Muslims at times marriage can be tough. But atleast amongst us, we have an arbitrator I.e Islam  that protects our rights and tells us to uphold our obligations to our spouses and our loved ones.   In ops case it becomes extremely difficult for him to fulfill her rights, he can fulfill his obligations but some obligations to a non Muslim wife will impede on his Islam.  I gave the example of keeping a cross or statues of Jesus (pbuh) in the house, it is her right to decorate her house with things she holds dear. But can he uphold that right of hers, because it'd mean he is going against Islam by keeping statues in his house.   Is it not impeding in her rights that she has to settle on a name that isn't a Christian name, but if they choose a Christian name would he be ok with it. I know Islamic standards for name are that it be a name with good meaning. So he might be ok with it, even if he can't choose a culturally Muslim name, which is impeding on his rights as a father. Children have a right to be raised as Muslims, but isn't that impeding on her rights that she not teach and pass down her beliefs to her children.   This lifestyle can be strenuous unless both parties let go of their religion and I don't think anyone of us are advocating for that.   Op should realize that marrying a non Muslim means, he is praying alone and not with the family, he is doing his suhoor alone, he is possibly doing Iftar alone because dinner time for his wife is a few hours earlier. He is alone excited at Eid, he is alone trying to figure out zakat. He is alone going to the masjid.it isn't in his wife's interest to teach their children an iota of competing theology. If he's taking them to the masjid, he better be ok with her taking them to the church.   How can a man and woman keep obligations to one another that oppose their own religions. How can one still follow his religion with out impeding on his wife's rights. It's extemporaneous important that we understand that if love is the only criteria in an interfaith marriage, then it's almost guaranteed that neither party will always uphold their obligations to the other and each party will be taking rights away from each other.   Ease in marriage is a good thing and not destructive. Marriage is long term and when when 2 people vow to be with each other it isn't for a few years, it's a vow for life, unless you're tired of this person you loved and sacrificed so much for, then divorce comes. But if you were going to go on a long journey, would you use the car that you love or would you use a car that has safety features that allow a long journey."

islam,3det3d,wolflarsen,2,Thu Jul 16 03:27:32 2015 UTC,"Aleykum Selam my brother,  By all means try to get sisters to help her if she is considering Islam, but if she would only convert to marry you this is concerning as it means there really is no conviction there. And assuming you live in a non-Muslim country this is the mother of your children, how will she raise them? Choose for your children as well as yourself. And realise that success in attaining something favoured by Allah, such as marriage, is not reached by means of his displeasure. Dating is sinful, it cannot lead to good in this world and the next.   So my advice is to repent to Allah from this sin, get sisters to advise her, do not tie your marriage to her conversion, give her the space and time to think, if she decides to remain christian and you are in a non-Muslim country it is a bad idea to get married, if not for you then for your kids."

He didn't say he's converting to Christianity and he's planning to marry this person.  OP, marry this woman if you feel she is the right one and has good character and you've discussed how you'll raise kids and all that, but you need to talk with your imam and ask if doing a ceremony in church after the Islamic ceremony is haram or not and not reddit. You might ask him while you're at it if the Church is a no-go if you can do the walk-down-the-aisle thing in a non-Church location.  If you end up with a church ceremony, you can meet with whoever is officiating and tell him it's a mixed muslim/christian wedding and if they can keep the speech/whatever away from Jesus and the trinity. I think plenty of Churches will be accommodating."

islam,3dck7d,seekerofwisewmen,25,Wed Jul 15 05:17:31 2015 UTC,"I think the best place to start is by reading the Quran itself. Muslims believe it to be the revealed word of God himself, as opposed to Christians who believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God written by men. Muslims also consider the Quran to be God's final revelation, brought by the last Prophet and Messenger Muhammad.   Pretty much all of Islam comes from the following three sources:   The Quran The Hadith: collections of orally transmitted narrations regarding Muhammad's words, actions and rulings. The Biographies of Muhammad: the earliest of which were written 100-200 years after Muhammad's life by scholars collecting Hadith and other historical documents.   So the best place to start is definitely the Quran. Many acclaimed translations exist and are easy to get hold of. This website contains the entire Quran which can be read in 6 different English translations.  The four most widely read and accepted English translations are the ones of Yusuf Ali, Muhsin Khan, Muhammad Pickthall and Muhammad Shakir. Yusuf Ali and Pickthall can be difficult because of their archaic prose. A new popular one seems to be the Sahih International translation, but I can't comment on how good or accepted by scholars it is.  A good idea is to pick a translation, read it, and whenever you find a verse you're curious about or are having trouble with, go to the website and check it out in different translations.  Good luck"

I understand fully why your heart was moved. The Kaaba is a simple structure, but the feelings and magnetism you experience when you're physically there, is hard to explain in words.  Likewise the entire Haj pilgrimage to the holy lands is a love story and bonding with our Creator. My experience there is etched forever in my heart.  My advice to start would be to read an English translation of the Quraan, and a book on the life story of the Prophet Muhammed (On whom be peace)  In essence being a Muslim is to attest and believe that there is only one God, and that the prophet Muhammed (on whom be peace) was the final Messenger of God, Allah.  Just as Jesus, Moses, Abraham and the rest of the esteemed prophets, were chosen people by God inspired with his message.  Once you attest to that, you're Muslim! And the rest of a lifelong journey in Islam begins."

Second, you should know that anyone that would help you succeeding this duty of worship Allah sincerely without rival supposed to be followed. There is a man called Muhammad, his followers are the most sincere follower of Allah. You can't fulfill your duty better except by following him.  Third you should know that this is a rough path, only a few can succeed. But Allah is merciful He tell us through His messenger a effective tool to keep us in our track.

islam,3dck7d,mahoodie,-1,Thu Jul 16 00:20:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response.  I have always had an issue with the statement that Mohammad was the perfect man. An exemplary human beings that all Muslims should revere. It was only until I read hadith and other literature that I came to my initial conclusion. As an anti-war advocate, it rubbed me the wrong way that Mohammad launched nearly 60 violent campaigns against nearby tribes who were not Muslim. There are also some salty hadith that describe his actions against dissendents as inhuman. I cite the hadith regarding those men who betrayed his kindness and whose treachery was met with their tortuous amputation and death. Torture is clearly a violation of modern human rights.  Also, he married many women and Aisha was one of them. We all acknowledge her age at the time of marriage and I don't think this is the action of a universally exemplary human being that all men and women should follow.   Islam also means to submit to the will of God. You bear no allegiance to anyone else and follow those laws only divinely ordained by him. Those laws are Sharia Law which, based on hadith and real world application, constitute as cruel and unusual punishment. Women's rights in Islam and modern women's rights vary drastically and fall short of being a universal template that can stand the test if time. It is frequently statedin the Quran that men should be the protectors and watchers of women and that they have a separate social and hierarchal status than men.

islam,3ddis0,uwootm8,5,Wed Jul 15 13:13:59 2015 UTC,"Then in that case, why are you asking us : )  But I think I know what you mean, you want it to be something that she wasn't specifically wanting, but will enjoy nonetheless."
islam,3ddis0,Rattional,2,Wed Jul 15 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"slept after iftar. Otherwise, would have asked the same question :p"
islam,3ddis0,PeanutRepublic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:56:53 2015 UTC,You've got it exactly.
islam,3ddis0,Rattional,4,Wed Jul 15 23:04:46 2015 UTC,"Here's a really amazing idea that'll pay off in the long run. It's incredibly simple but has the potential to become the most beautiful thing you can ever do/give your wife. It's probably more suitable for anniversaries but you can do it for eid, or both your anniversary and eid if you want.   Basically: buy a nice simple seasons greetings card. Write ""eid mubarak honey bubbies 2015"" to your wife and then have her write ""eid mubarak to you hobby bobbies 2015"". Keep that card safe and then the next year write ""happy eid 2016"" to your wife and then give her the card so she can write ""happy eid 2016"" back to you.  Repeat this cycle every year until finally death parts either of you from each other. If your wife dies first, you write your last ""eid mubarak"", and if you die first let your wife write her final ""eid mubarak"". When you guys reunite in jannah, the one who died first can sign the final ""eid mubarak"" haha  It'd probably make more sense for an anniversary card but ahh well..."

islam,3dem81,jokul,5,Wed Jul 15 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"fun fact, tasting food, while not swallowing doesn't break your fast.  Some say that the goal of the fast is for the wealthier among our ummah can understand what it is like to go hungry,so that they will be more empathetic."

islam,3dem81,moon-jellyfish,7,Thu Jul 16 02:59:03 2015 UTC,"Tasting food is permissible during fasting, as long as you don't swallow anything.  And the goal of fasting was stated in Surat al-Baqara, Verse 183: to become righteous."
islam,3dfn4h,kfo-AE,5,Wed Jul 15 22:06:54 2015 UTC,"According to this, you can not break the fast until you actually start traveling. Merely having the intention to travel is not enough to break the fast."

islam,3ddque,StephyHoneycomb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:26:40 2015 UTC,"you can write both, though, ramzan is now almost over , and eid is very near, so i guess Eid Mubarak is suitable."
