We don't use the term ""poisoning"" for it, though I suppose that's probably just semantics. No two cases present exactly the same as there is never a ""normal"" diving casualty, but they share many similar symptoms.   In the diving navy, we use an acronym called VENTIDC for O2 tox hit symptoms and how they present on a patient.    V - Visual distortion/disturbance (loss of vision, spots in vision, tunnel vision)  E- Ears ringing/roaring (Many report hearing a mechanical grinding or a roaring sound) N - Nausea T - Tingling/twitching of the face or other extremities.  I - Irritability (Patient acts uncharacteristically personality wise. Hard to gauge as you must know your patient.)

This is largely not an issue in recreational diving using air, where Nitorgen Narcosis will be in play long before O2 Toxicity will be. Recreational divers using Nitrox, however, can find themselves in trouble around the 100' depths because of the highly elevated percentage of O2 in their mix.  Navy divers and commercial divers, who are much deeper for much longer than recreational divers, are susceptible when using Surface Supplied Air."

navy,3e2jnx,justarandomshooter,7,Tue Jul 21 22:27:29 2015 UTC,"My understanding is as follows.  The Navy has two promotion cycles per year. Other branches of service have several opportunities to promote throughout the year. So aside from a CAP, you'll either be promoted via the March exam or September exam. It's not feasible to promote everyone at once, because if the Navy were run like any other service the promotions would be spread out through the calendar year. I'm hoping this is making sense so far.   Let's take the Army, for example. They convene their advancement boards throughout the year. There is a steady and controlled increase of rank. The Navy also has to spread out their advancements. So what the Navy does is put you in a group once you have been selected for advancement. They allow you to wear the rank and be entitled to the privileges (and responsibilities) of your new rank, despite the fact you are not yet paid. You are not being paid because you were not in the top whatever percent of those Sailors who were selected for advancement that particular cycle. If the Navy ran like the other branches of service, you would not be wearing your E5 rank right now. Not until you got paid, anyway.   Instead of complaining that you are losing money (which you aren't), Sailors should realize that you are authorized the perks of rank before any other branch of service."
navy,3e2jnx,chicostick,3,Tue Jul 21 14:14:31 2015 UTC,"I thought theres only 2 groups now though, top 5% and the rest, so doesnt that still make the vast majority advance at the same time."

navy,3e2jnx,pumahog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:42:24 2015 UTC,Interestingly the Air Force has 1 cycle per year. That's when you advance. You test each time like we do as well.
navy,3e2jnx,Tilden_Katz,3,Tue Jul 21 22:32:09 2015 UTC,"The basic answer is that it has to do with how selectees are prioritized for advancement. Your FMS on your profile sheet dictates your selection priority (higher FMS = earlier advancement). If I can remember correctly, the top 3% of selectees advance the first month, the next 3% the next month, and so on until six months out and then the final 85% are advanced together. Thus, most people will wait 6 months for their actual advancement when they are paid at their new rank.   The explanation for this practice is that frocking let's you assume all the duties of your new rank without the Navy actually having to pay you at your rank."
navy,3e2jnx,StrykerJB,6,Tue Jul 21 14:53:51 2015 UTC,Well frocking is really just letting you wear the rank before you actually are that rank.  Would you rather just wait until the day you get paid to put it on (as most officers have to do)?

For a period several (not so ethical) commanders used it to reward their favorites.  In hospitals the administration types would often get frocked.  Then PERS dropped the hammer (like 15 or more years ago).  Only in a very, very few named circumstances can a Naval Officer be frocked: usually when serving in a CO position above your current grade (O-6 and you are an O-5), a few joint positions, and some diplomatic posts.  Other than that: an officer won't be promoted until their name appears on the list for that month."

navy,3e2jnx,EmoticonIlliterate,2,Tue Jul 21 14:49:01 2015 UTC,"From the Wikipedia page on frocking:   The need to frock is a result of the fact that the number of people who may serve in a particular rank is restricted by federal law. Thus, even though an individual may have been selected for promotion and, for officers, confirmed by the Senate, they must often wait for a vacancy (headroom) to occur in order to be officially promoted.    It is also a special custom in the Navy from years of Naval Tradition. It is supposed to be a privilege and an honor.  If you don't feel it's an honor then I don't know what to tell you."
navy,3e2jnx,dilloncarson,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:03:20 2015 UTC,What about not getting paid makes it an honor? In the civilian sector the same mentality would be balked at.

If I have to now be LPO, go to 365, pay FCPOA dues, then I should be getting paid now. Honor my ass. Twice the work without the pay. You should get paid from the day you put it on. But the navy saves money by not paying you for 6 months, that is all there is to it. CAP's get paid upfront. How is that fair? I passed the test and advanced, you didn't.

The Navy is unique in that you are allowed to present as a higher rank than you actually are for a half of a year. Don't like it? Don't frock early or get a better score so you actually get the rank earlier.
navy,3e2jnx,Titus142,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:51:58 2015 UTC,"That is my point. When I put it on, I should be that rank. Not wait 6 months after being selected. But clearly everyone is of the ""that's the way we always do it"" mentality. So as usual, nothing will change in the Navy."
navy,3e2jnx,tolstoy425,4,Tue Jul 21 19:18:36 2015 UTC,"Jeez dude if you don't want to be frocked then refuse the frocking and wait out the 6 months.  I don't see how you're viewing frocking as a negative thing?  It lets you get promoted as soon as you find out.  We're the only branch (to my knowledge) that 'promotes' you as soon as you're selected, everyone else has to wait 6 months to a year to actually get promoted after selection.  How is it a negative thing?"
navy,3e2jnx,Titus142,0,Tue Jul 21 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"That is not my point. Everyone is so hung up on this frocking period. The point is the whole having to wait after getting selected. It makes no sense. Results come out, you put it on, you get paid. That is the way it should be."
navy,3e2jnx,tolstoy425,2,Tue Jul 21 21:12:23 2015 UTC,"That would be ideal but you're talking about making a change not just in the Navy but the entire DoD since we're not the only branch that waits to pay you after selection.  At least with the current system in the Navy you can actually wear the rank that you earned.    I don't think you're looking at the big picture either.  The reason why the delayed promotion program is the way it is is because there have to be vacancies to fill for people to get promoted (that's why we have cutting scores and quotas).  Vacancies are created as soon as people are promoted to the next higher paygrade or get out of the Navy.  People aren't always leaving the Navy at the exact same time to create those vacancies so they're created over a period of time.  To fill those vacancies the Navy and the other services need to control how many people they allow to fill those vacancies at a time.  You might not realize it but every single month in the Navy people are getting promoted, as soon as the promotees for cycle 1's promotions are starting to get paid the first group of people for cycle 2's promotions are starting to get paid.  The system wont work if everyone was just paid at the same time because there arent that many actual positions open."
navy,3e2jnx,Fuckyoucocksmooch,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:53 2015 UTC,Officers have to wait a hell of a lot longer to promote after they have been selected for advancement.  Enlisted have it way better.

I'm envious of your profession and I'm sorry for saying you're not a warfighter.   Physical standards are not really tough but they are standards. I'm not advocating kicking people out for one failure but I am advocating that we maintain and uphold standards. If someone can't meet the standards then how does that make them a model or great sailor?   It's not different than if someone went to work without shaving everyday. Or someone who goes to work with incorrect earrings and jewelry. How about someone whose constantly late?  Is there a difference? Both are standards right? Are we supposed to choose which ones are more important?   If this person can't seem to do the simple task of taking care of themselves as an adult how can we expect him to perform in adverse conditions?  Sure it hasn't happened in a long time but what happens when we say they need to be up for 36 hours to man a watch station?  In his mind it's okay if he goes and sleeps for 45 minutes or so. Why? Because he gets slack cut for everything else So why would we he be held accountable for this?  Why do you think Marines are so strict about everything. Same reason. If we keep cutting slack where does it end? People need to understand that there are repercussions for failing.  It's a slippery slope and you as a lawyer should understand that. It isn't about physical fitness. It's as simple as being able to do what your asked and maintain a baseline. Brilliant on the basics. That's how wars are own.

But double jeopardy doesn't apply to NJP, and if the federal government chooses not to pursue the DUI charge then the Navy has the discretion to prosecute under the UCMJ, in which case double jeopardy still doesn't apply because he was never charged in the first instance. He will also have access to JAG in that case too, so he'll get his super federal lawyer who's experienced with the administrative aspect of the issue.  Edit: spelling"
navy,3e0as3,Tilden_Katz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:16:10 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Double Jeopardy can apply to NJP, but it's pretty specific circumstances and can get waived. For instance, I had a DUI about 4 years ago. It went to trial before I was released from jail. Because I had already gotten sentenced in civilian courts, they had to get a letter from the admiral before they could actually take me to NJP. This took about 3 weeks. Of course he agreed and I got fun times in front of a green table, but it just took some time.   Nothing I said applies to this case though, but at least I found something to do during lunch."

The only other way he'll get a bad discharge and lose his pension is going to a seperation board.

And then we can't carry them visibly in uniform if it's a personal weapon--that's out of uniform.  Not to mention we'll probably have to register the guns in question with security. Be required to store them in a base-approved safe at work or in housing. Have to carry them correctly in the car (ammo in the trunk, gun in the glove compartment etc).  Probably will be required to have state concealed carry license, and then so many hours of military training on top of that. All the page 13s that will be signed.   I guarantee even if it gets passed, as it is written right now it's at the CO's discretion....So probably ""only E7 and above will be authorized."" AND you'll have to re-qualify every time you PCS to a new duty station.  And one more point--everyone is imagining this will turn into a free-for all with gun accidents a la Georgia Recruiter (or SITREPS of drunken domestic debacles), but I suspect it'll probably end up more like Kenessaw, Georgia with a decrease in weapons related incidents on base."

We license people to operate motor vehicles because driving is dangerous, but don't show the same level of concern over how to properly handle a gun.   I would want to make absolutely sure my little sailor was taught, and understood the ramifications of screwing up, before letting him tote a gun to the commissary just to feel safe on base.

If I had to guess, AV-15 is likely.) I hope holds has gotten a bit better these days because some students would really be stuck there for months upwards to a year (not that San Diego's a bad place to get stuck).  And who knows, what happened to a few of my friends through school could happen again where they went through an AV-15 operator class and then half the class getting shipped to Washington for IUSS school instead. It probably is better to not go in expecting one thing because things have a way of changing up on you."

navy,3e0izh,Militantheretic,2,Tue Jul 21 21:16:42 2015 UTC,It really depends on whether you are a 4yo or 6yo or how many years you signed up for. 4yo do not go to ATT in Great Lakes as far as I know. You will head to San Diego for A school right after boot camp. That will last about 2 to 3 months depending on what pipeline they send you to. If you are a 6yo you will go across the street at Great Lakes for ATT which lasts between 5 and 8 weeks. (It's mostly self paced so up to you) then you will go to San Diego for a pipeline that on the short end will be 6-8 months but could last over a year and a half.

Waited over a year and then enlisted as a nuke 'cause I couldn't wait anymore.  You have no access to your horn in boot.  When you report to Charleston for A school you can have it, assuming you can fit it in the limited space available.  I was told I couldn't play it in my room except on weekends - I went to the parking lot at night.  When I was in Charleston, I talked to Chaplain Bender to see if there were any local opportunities, given my restrictions on time and travel...and there really weren't.  So we started a volunteer hodgepodge band to play some Christmas carols.  I left shortly after Christmas and those involved wanted to keep it going (Chaplain and her husband, a few staff, and mostly students).  From the other comments posted it seems like it's still going, so hopefully it will still be a thing when you get there, if you so choose.  It's not a college level group for sure, but for the short time you'll be in the area it will give you an opportunity to blow some notes and be with friends.  Plus, the Chaplain will give you credit for some volunteer hours if you play at some graduations.  If you get enough (>200hrs in < 6 months when I was there) you can earn your volunteer service medal.  In the short time you are in Charleston, you won't be able to commit to any local group, really.  Moreover, the time investment at A school and Powerschool is significant. 12-14 hour days are the norm, and you have PT, meals, and sleep, and well theres your day.  You can bring your horn on a ship, stash it in your dormitory at NNPTC, practice in the parking lot 'cause you don't want to annoy the entire wing and be 'that guy'.  It's truthfully a lot of crap to put up with for a hobby, but if its something you want to keep and maintain for your life then do it.  So yes there is a band at NNPTC and while it is not a college level ensemble it is a chance to blow your horn and be with friends and take your mind off of nuke school."

navy,3dydtm,Maggiemayday,4,Mon Jul 20 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, I married a lazy ass who was the biggest slob ever and spent all my money, tried to use up my re-enlistment bonus, and then decided he didn't want to re-up too because he wanted to ""work on his music"".  Wanted his own bedroom too.  Had me completely fooled with romantic love songs and liking everything I did.  Nope, he was ""just being polite because we were dating"".  Had I been able to live with him for a week, I'd not have married him.    But then, I was 30 when I married another sailor, and we've been together 28 years now.  So yeah, maybe wait for a bit of maturity and don't think you'll always be alone if you don't marry young.  Be joyfully single until you're a little older and more experienced.    Still, if a young couple is hot to marry, I'd not say no.  I'd give the trust and communication lecture, suggest the pre-marital counseling sessions the Navy offers, but otherwise, none of my damn business.  Some young couples do work out fine.  Others marry a learning opportunity.  Sorry OP, but your life lesson has to be repeated in person by other troubled couples, or they learn nothing.

I know a lot of people who got married and divorced within 2 years and I've just never seen or heard of this outside of the navy.

The first thing that caught my eye is ask why you were denied on your 3 PRD looks, if it was ""not enough quotas"" continue with life, if its something else correct that immediately if possible. You don't want a simple error killing your chances at your SEAOS looks.  The way I understand it (which may be outdated or just plain wrong) the first thing that is taken into account is the rank of the applicant. From the C-WAY manual you currently fall into this scenario - Balanced Reenlistment: Fully manned skill sets. All reenlistment eligible E-5 through E3 will be adjudicated based on manning in their year groups. With a small rate like MC the ECM is probably micromanaging quotas to keep the best sailors in. They have a lot of leeway and don't want to give up 1 of a small number of quotas to an underperformer when they know they have some high performers coming into the window soon. Now that you are a frocked E-5 you should have little issue as instead of being middle of the pack in an overmanned YG you are towards the top."

Generally speaking as a reservist you will do the whole 1 weekend a month, 2 weeks a year thing.  However 1 out of every 5 years you'll be expected to mobilize and deploy.  Mobilizations roll off the emails frequently and you can pick one ahead of time if you see one you like or have it in your life to deploy.  Retirement starts at age 60 unlike the active duty retirement of the 20 year mark, however it is prorated some by the amount of time you were active.  You have to do a certain amount of drill time each year to have a ""good year"" that counts towards retirement.    In short, its a different set up so get full disclosure from a reserve recruiter before you make the transition."

I know Big Navy always needs MAs for mobs and stuff, so you may get lucky in that regard if you want to deploy. I'd keep asking around and just see where you are in your life.

Once you're at 03/DH level no one gives a flying fuck what your degree is in. They care if you can actually perform and lead in your warfare area of expertise.   Take your STEM circle jerk elsewhere.  Edit: just read post history. Looks like you're a non qual boot who hasn't even completed a training pipeline.   Want some advice? Don't be that guy.

navy,3du3md,BurningBushes2000,7,Sun Jul 19 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to agree with the other in this thread. It's more than just Narional and Regional accreditation. University of Phoenix and American Military University are both fully accredited nationally and regionally but are also both considered jokes. Don't sell yourself short taking short cuts and going to online schools pushed by navy college.   There are more accreditations too. For business there is AACSB, for medical there is another one, for every field that pays well there is another accreditation that most once schools don't have.   If you want to go to school and you're west coast, San Diego City  College or Grossmont Community are both excellent 2 year university's that offer night classes.   If you're in Hawaii the UH community college system is also excellent. Hpu and Chaminade are also great choices with night/online.  Stay away from UMUC, COLUMBIA, U PHOENIX, AMU, etc. If you plan on being a lifer then that is one thing but eventually everyone is going to hit the civilian sector and you don't want to be disadvantaged.   You also don't want to pigeon hole yourself into the Navy. I probably will stay in but doesn't mean I don't want to be prepared if I change my mind or get let go from the navy.

He said when he makes a hiring decision the quality of degree makes a huge difference for a recent college grad with very little work experience, but for someone with lots of relevant experience in the field the degree means almost nothing. So if you are a CTN with 4 years of experience and a networking degree from UMUC you would be in high demand to networking companies, but if you are a 4 year HM with a Business Administration degree you need to have the right name on the degree."

If you have a sailor that is trying to figure this stuff out do them a favour and introduce them on Facebook/LinkedIn/email to someone who has actually gotten out. We all know someone and no vet won't take 10 minutes to talk about their experience.   Wtf would I know about job interviews for civilian corporations. I've been on the navy's tit for a decade. What I do know is a shipmate who got out and now works for tesla. Here is his email. Ask him how he did that.   As for college why would you want to take the easiest pain free option?

Want to work for a big four accounting firm?   Consulting?   Banking?   Tech in Silicon Valley?   Go to top grad schools?   No way will UMUC ever open any of those doors.      Further,  you have 0 alumni network or hookups with UMUC."

I agree you should not get a degree through them, but if you don't intend on staying in the navy, they are a great school to get credits to transfer from. I have friends that chose UMUC and transferred their credits to Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech.   The school not being a division one research university is a moot point in the grand scheme of things. There isn't a single online only school that will deliver the same academic environment of a regular college, they're designed for people who can't attend a brick and mortar school because of work (in this case, navy). These online schools give sailors flexibility to be able to attend college on their own time without having to physically be there.   For many people taking these online classes, they don't care about getting jobs in Silicon Valley, they want to advance their current career.   And for the record, many DOD contractors are far from getting paid shit."
navy,3du3md,weinerpretzel,2,Sun Jul 19 14:51:43 2015 UTC,"UMUC is a bad choice for knocking out gen ed course only because it's expensive. They charge $250 a credit for every course and it will always be the max that TA allows. The community college I'm going to now charges $55 a credit with zero fees. That means when I max TA I can continue taking classes with minimal out of pocket expense. Plus I can find books on craigslist for nothing, lots of students that get grants and loans buy new books then dump them at the end of the semester."

This allows me to ask questions beyond what is in the course material and get a valid answer to further my knowledge as opposed to the art class I just took where the instructor just read the powerpoint provided by the textbook publisher.  So far I've noticed about half the students in any class are students that normally attend the University Park campus but are studying abroad or home for the summer.

If I wanted to transfer to University Park I would be recognized as a Senior with a 3.5 GPA and 25 credits of upper level classes to complete. But I'm stationed across the country and happy with my current position so I have no desire to get out and go to school full time to finish it off, so I'll stay on the 16 credit a year plan.

For instance, the MBA from Penn State University Park would come form the Smeal College of Business.    The degrees awarded from Penn State World Wide depends on which college is sponsoring the program.  The majority of the programs are not sponsored by University Park Colleges.

Well, straight from the website:   ""To learn more about the Bachelor of Science in Accounting, offered in partnership with the Penn State Harrisburg School of Business Administration, contact:""  Is Penn State Harrisburg part of the Penn State system?  Yes.  When you get the degree, are you a Penn State University Park graduate (the flagship campus and highly ranked University)?  No.    Penn State system =/= Penn State University Park.

It would be because your new billet at your new command would require a PRD of at least a certain time away.   Google RC to AC. Find out what's open and what your year group is    Next look at your manning pdf. You can find it on the same site. If your rank and rate isn't allowing cross rating out then you're stuck.  Look at the part that shows your future fiscal year manning levels.   You could extend for 2 years in the hope you can convert out at a later time.

navy,3dri0z,Not_A_CEO,6,Sat Jul 18 19:25:34 2015 UTC,"As a Diving Corpsman, here is what I have to say:  First of all,if you haven't already, find your nearest navy dive locker and get a feel for what they do and if you like what you see,tell them you want to ""mudpup"".     Diver boot camp will be tough, I know, but how tough? What exercises can I start now to improve my PT scores? I genuinely enjoy working out but despise running.    The fitness standards are outlined for the MILPERSMAN 1220-410 SEAL/EOD/SWCC/DIVER/AIRR PHYSICAL SCREENING TESTING STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES.  You basically have a 500m swim (12:30 or better), max pushups, max situps, max pullups and a run. The standards vary for each community, but for diving, the MINIMUM standards are: 12:30 500m swim, 50 pushups, 50 curlups, 6 pullups and a 12:30 1.5mi run. You should be faster with higher numbers to be competitive and to pass dive school.   You mentioned you despise running. Tough shit, go run. Dive prep and the first few weeks of dive school are filled with running and multiple PSTs. Cant keep up with the group, get dropped, its pretty clear cut. Dive school isn't the time to start running as you will likely get shinsplints from the new stress load on your knees and get medically rolled in all likelihood. My suggestion, is to do nothing but those exercises in the PST. There aren't bench press or squat competitions in dive school. Get comfortable in the water, water is the great equalizer, and if you aren't comfortable in the water, maybe diving isnt for you.     Diving Officer, or stay enlisted? Do Officers learn at least some of the skills the enlisted guys do or not? Do they go on many dives at all?    That depends, NDs do the grunt work, the daily diving, the propeller swaps, the hull inspections, clean the diving rigs after usage,etc. Diving officers are navy engineering officers that are diver trained. Diving officer as a stand alone job was ended some years ago, and is filled in with engineering officers and diving warrant officers. They do the overseeing and supervision of diving work and are generally less likely to go diving on a daily basis.     what jobs could I choose from as a Diver? All I've been told is ""You can do construction or salvage."" That's it. I'd like to talk in depth to someone about this--going back into the civilian world with skill sets is important to me, even if I stay in 20 years or only 8.    That's pretty spot on, whoever said that to you. Many divers that retire end up going out to commercial diving and ocean engineering companies after they retire or get out. Some do contract diving work for the navy or other federal agencies. You learn welding work,but probably not as good as a SW, you learn explosives handling, but not as well as an EOD tech, you shoot, but not as well as a SO."

navy,3dri0z,Krokod1l,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:31:55 2015 UTC,The diving medical officer/undersea medical officer as far as I know is more of a sub specialty/warfare designator than a primary occupation for the doctors.

navy,3dri0z,BaconsRebellion,4,Tue Jul 21 19:45:57 2015 UTC,"A wrote a magnificent piece on the subject whilst on the porcelain throne but being so enthralled in it I didn't notice my dwindling battery on my phone and it died and I lost it all. So this is the quick and dirty version:  As far ""diver boot camp"", you're cross rating, you go to dive school not boot camp again. You first have to pass the PST (physical screening test) to get the contract, and by pass do exceedingly well because you compete for these contracts. There's guys coming in to the navy with these contracts who train a long time to get them and dive school is also where a lot of guys who wash out of BUD/s go and you know those guys are freaks of nature. So do good on that and then go to 6 weeks of dive prep in Great Lakes. This is the weeding out process, you'll be treading with 25# plates more often than not but conditioning runs are only about 3 miles. You'll be done with your day right around after lunch though. This is the part where you just don't quit and drown if you have to, they'll bring you back to life and give you the rest of the day off, no biggie. Then you go to Panama City for actual dive school, it's about two months of dive physics and practical diving both day and night dives so if you have any fears of what's swimming around you at night nows the time to get over it. Then you get a dive pin at graduation, cash in your enlistment bonus of 8k, get dive pay and demo pay extra a month and live a good life in somewhere tropical.  Officer and enlisted I don't know. I know enlisted can get more dive pay a month than officer but it probably doesn't equal out to as much an officer gets just being an officer. So don't know much sorry.  After navy jobs are of course underwater construction where I've heard of some places giving you a 100$ a minute you're under the water, but if that's not your thing that's not your thing. What I would do is get PADI certified as a diver in the civilian world, open up a dive shop that offers certifications, equipment and tours and move to the Keyes and bring out sun burnt fatties to go look at the fishies underwater and make sure they didn't drown. But that's just what I would do.  I've got all this information from a buddy though who's not a diver but a HM DMT (dive med tech). They go through dive school with guys that are rated for ND though and he has a pretty good insight. So take it for what it's worth. Hope some of this helped. If you're serious about the switch start crushing the PST now because like I said you'll be going up against some studs."
navy,3dri0z,BurningBushes2000,2,Sat Jul 18 22:12:51 2015 UTC,I could be wrong but I'm 99 percent sure there is a PQS to wear a Second Class Diver Pin and they don't earn that until at their first command and completed all quals. I think only scuba gets a pin right after dive school.
navy,3dri0z,BaconsRebellion,2,Sat Jul 18 22:44:47 2015 UTC,"Like I said I'm getting this info second hand.

There was no way of definitively proving that he didn't take anything, so he was administratively separated."

My OG recruiter went to CO Mass at district, was busted to E5 and descreened from recruiting. Funny thing is I ran into him at my 3rd command as a Chief and 3MC for a big deck amphib. It really is a small Navy."

navy,3dp3yz,voodoo_curse,3,Sun Jul 19 04:34:04 2015 UTC,Why did he have a firearm in the office to begin with?
navy,3dp3yz,theKeithJackson,22,Sat Jul 18 02:41:17 2015 UTC,"Uhh for real? I would guess that it was a reaction to the fact that a recruiting office got shot up the day before by a terrorist, I mean he's still wrong but that should be the obvious reason as to why he had a firearm and realistically soft targets like that should be trained and supplied so they can provide their own security."
navy,3dp3yz,Kailuafornia,12,Sat Jul 18 04:33:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this may actually be his saving grace.  Not saying it excuses his actions, but Gainesville, GA isn't THAT far from Chattanooga, so I can see his reasoning.    Poor guy was probably legitimately scared for his life, but he is an awful gun owner in regards to weapon safety.  There's pretty much no excuse for an accidental discharge if you have the weapon properly secured."
navy,3dqpfi,faustrex,6,Sat Jul 18 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate on this topic, block 33 (If i remember correctly) covers how good you are at your job. Collateral duties show you are invested in more than just your job.   I expect my PO1's to be SME's and make it clear that is my expectation. You better believe that if I had a useless tech that raised 50k for MWR I wouldn't rate him above the amazing tech that minimally participated in MWR/FCPOA events. The problem lies in that by having no collateral duties I have no ground to stand on in a ranking board.  Think of it this way, your the best STG1 on the boat but have no collaterals, and you're competing with the top BM1 who is the president of the FCPOA, and QM1 who is the CFL. You just sent me into battle with a gun and no bullets..."
navy,3dqpfi,oldelkgrove,2,Sat Jul 18 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"That's my issue, I think. The ranking boards don't really take into account, in any quantifiable measure, how a sailor performs at his actual job. If there's ever a system that requires the attention of a technician at all times, there could very well be a first-class technician who has no time to do anything but his job. In that case, despite that guy giving 110% at his job at all times, being an SME, being fully qualified, etc., the fact that a guy in some other rate (also SME, also excellent at his job, which requires less work in general) that has a little more time on their hands and has a guy that's the moderator of the command's facebook page that's getting the EP seems kind of shitty."
navy,3dqpfi,Titus142,4,Sat Jul 18 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"This is so true. Pitting an OS that is involved in all the extra curriculars and has time for lots of collaterals up against say an FC that repaired SPY, is the SME on BMD, and kept the whole thing running. I guarantee I will have to fight tooth and nail at ranking boards for the FC because he does not meet enough checks in boxes (I'm not even an FC and I would fight for that guy). Problem is, most of the people on ranking boards know nothing about your job and how important, or impactful what you did was. They don't understand that you didn't have time for the other bullshit. You were working late on your primary duties.   The other sad truth is, on ranking boards, the loud guy is the one getting his way a lot of the time. If you don't have someone strong in there fighting for you then you will get lost in the shuffle to get that ""Well rounded"" OS to the top."
navy,3dqpfi,oldelkgrove,2,Sat Jul 18 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiousity, does everyone else in your div/dept (stg's) stay as long as you do, or are you that guy that takes everything on and does not delegate work? That does get noticed, it's a leadership thing. If you all do about the same amount of work, something is terribly wrong with your dept."
navy,3dqpfi,weinerpretzel,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:11:59 2015 UTC,"I don't delegate anything. I honestly can't live with myself if someone is working more than me as a result of my own actions. If something has to be done by someone else, I can delegate the task to them, but I at least stay and help them."
navy,3dqpfi,SoCalNavy,2,Sat Jul 18 20:55:51 2015 UTC,"That's not good leadership. You need to be able to delegate appropriate tasks. Remember that the first line of the 5.0 block for Leadership says: Inspiring motivator and trainer, subordinates reach highest level of growth and development. That ship will continue to sail if you die or transfer tomorrow, if your junior Sailors can't do the job that you are doing you have failed them as a mentor. I am the same way and hate handing a task of to some junior Sailor that won't be able to do it as well as I can and will take twice as long. But if you don't let that happen they will never learn and get better.   Plus, that isn't my job anymore, as the LPO I am responsible to make sure that the entire Division is running correctly. I make sure my Second Classes know what is expected and do my best to keep bullshit from rolling past the DivO and Chief to them. Part of being a good leader is taking off the training wheels, let your Sailors fail, allow them to learn from there mistakes. Then you will have time to take on additional responsibilities and your subordinates will get the leadership experience they need for when you are gone. As a First Class you are already expected to be a SME, some jobs are easier to be good at than other, so as a STG1 you are assumed to be good at being a STG1 and if all you do is meet that expectaion you are by definition a 3.0 Sailor. I would trade you my two EP ranked Third Classes for one 3.0 Third Class. They are better then their competition and while I don't think they are 5.0 sailors they will still be ranked above less deserving Sailors and there eval scores will reflect ranking not the actual words in that block."
navy,3dqpfi,Twisky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:41:19 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good point. If I'm doing something (say, a maintenance check) one of the junior guys hasn't, I usually bring them along and let them observe. As far as doing scenarios and operating goes, I pretty much always put people out of their comfort zones to get better at different aspects of ASW when I made watch section inputs to my LPO.  Right now, I'm in a unique position at a shore duty where there aren't really any junior guys to show anything to, and leadership is essentially the entire job regardless."
navy,3dqpfi,theKeithJackson,3,Sun Jul 19 01:15:03 2015 UTC,"Blake, is this you?!...  Edit: Just kidding, Blake is working today.   The reality of today's Navy is as /u/Titus142 describes it. I have to fight tooth and nail at SOQ/SOY boards for the folks that dedicate hours/days/weekends to troubleshooting and maintenance to maintain their gear for the ""mission"" to be competitively looked at when OS's/CT's ( no crack on OS's/CT's, you picked your rate, good on you) are off of the ship most days by 1400 and unless we are underway, can maintain an easy schedule. BUT I WILL ADD THIS: By the time that you are a 1st Class and aspiring Chief, the expectation is already there that you are an SME. Now its about what you are doing for the folks that work for you (QUALIFYING YOUR Replacement(s), writing their JSOQ packages, putting them in for a CAP/MAP, writing them up for NAM's, etc.). Pushing your division/department to be better qualified should be where your focus lies.   Lastly, document everything that you do. I received a ""brag sheet"" from a sailor last year that was 7 pages long, broken down by week of about 40 weeks, very little ""fluff"" and was extremely detailed. Initially I scoffed that someone was bragging that much about themselves, until I read it. I walked away impressed, no one in the room could deny that hard work was put in by this individual and their ranking was raised a lot higher because of the facts on the paper, versus someone in the room's opinion of this individuals work ethic."
navy,3dqpfi,voodoo_curse,3,Sat Jul 18 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"I think every single person will agree with you on this. The problem being is that nobody here is high ranking enough to change it and the brass won't change it because they don't wanna rock the boat.   This is also a frequent topic on every other board /r/army, /r/USMC and especially /r/AirForce"
navy,3dqpfi,HBHT9,5,Sat Jul 18 17:27:28 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. As an AC3 I feel like nothing is more important right now than being a fully qualified air traffic controller at my air station. I received a P on my frocking Eval because I hadn't volunteered since my last eval and I hadn't started school yet, even though with the level of constant studying being an AC requires it would possibly conflict. However my BJOQ offered no help towards my eval."
navy,3dqpfi,notapunk,2,Sat Jul 18 16:35:57 2015 UTC,"I can't help but feel like ACs are a rare exception. You absolutely should not have any collateral duties until you get your ass qualified. There's even an instruction that supports this, I think it's in the 80T-114. At the <E5 level, you're only being judged against the other ACs in your shop anyway, so collaterals and volunteer work shouldn't be a huge factor.  That said, it's perfectly acceptable to get a P on your frocking eval. Even if you were an EP E3, once you make E4 you move to a different peer group. Gotta start from the bottom again."

If I have a sailor who hasn't completed a single significant qualification milestone and they've been around along enough for me to remember their name then they are lacking. But what the Navy does is ""descreened"" from their command and send them back to the TPU loop.   If a CO could make the ""Not recommended for retention"" or being able to give a SP or below eval easier, maybe I would like the system. But as it stands a person delinquent on warfare qual will get a worse eval against someone who went to NJP."
navy,3dqpfi,smokinglamp_throw,2,Mon Jul 20 03:37:00 2015 UTC,"There is the whole issue with the eval system. Be the best at your job but your not on MWR? Not in an association? Well fuck you P sailor. What a piece of shit.  Next guy knows nothing about his job, but president of MWR, association, voulinteer hours? Promote this guy! EP sailor! Leader of the pack!  It is the ""wicket"" system that is the problem. Evals don't look at the whole, just checks in boxes. Not enough checks = crappy eval. Should you be well rounded? Yes, absolutely. But not to the detriment of your primary duties."
navy,3dqpfi,RSmithWORK,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:05:18 2015 UTC,"I think the Navy should handle advancement more like the Army: based on quals, PRT score, and college education more than volunteerism and a stupid test.

That said Red Wing makes one that is close. I even thought of writing to them to see if they could custom make one to fit exactly. Bet I could even drum up a bunch of orders for them.

The 800ST is one of the best boots you can find that are Navy approved, the Wellco version is garbage and I would get them replaced about every 6 months for soles worn flat or ripping off. I have no experience with the Bates boot but have heard nothing good about it.  The 800ST can be found for about $180, the Bates boot is $80 at the exchange. I wouldn't go so far as to say the 800ST is worth more than twice as much, I've always had mine issued by the squadron as organisational clothing."

navy,3doh65,Mr_Weebles,9,Fri Jul 17 23:07:15 2015 UTC,"The Blue Weenie went in dry this month.  We have a CWO who got a year in the hoosegow and a $25K fine for  larceny and making a false official statement.  A LT got 100 days in the can for viewing pornography on a government computer.  An E-4 was guilty of failure to obey an order or regulation and indecent viewing. he got the Big Chicken Dinner, dropped to E-2 and 18 months.  An MM1 decided to get all sexual assaulty and then went for assault consummated by a battery. Four years, a DD and he's now an E-1.  AND SO MUCH MORE!"

Keep a positive attitude, try to put forth an effort in whatever you end up doing next.

As people have posted, you don't necessarily have to go conventional and I'd recommend looking at rates that you'd be interested in and figure out their manning. Last I checked, they were looking for ACs, which is an awesome rate. CTNs are also a good choice if you want to stay state side and be very marketable on the outside.   With all the free time you have, make sure not to get in trouble. No one wants you to end up in the Friday funnies. Again congrats as you work on taking a new step in your naval career."

DTP was the shit.  It was back by the Border Patrol boot camp and had a bunch of trails there way back in the woods.  One dude had a Jeep and we went mudding.  No one there really gave a shit what you did except for the Nuke instructors that showed up for duty.  It was really easy work like shredding papers.  I became duty driver early on and just chilled most the day.  Half the barracks had internet connected for free and I didn't have a roommate. So I just played Age of Empires II all day.  I had a few friends and we went to the beach and chilled out at people apartments.  I got drunk for my first time there.  Life may seem shitty now but you are getting ready for a nice vacation is it resembles how it used to be. I ended up a GSM and had a decent rest of my naval career.

I got to pick an SECF rate going into sub school while all the booter scrubs were sweating about their dream sheets. AND since you were a Nuke you get there as a third and will be up for second as you are leaving your training command.  Once you get to a boat you will realize that failing out of powerschool was the smartest thing you did in your naval career thus far.

My classmates are either LCDRs or retired now (and you never realize how small the Navy is until you have one random person you met end up being a department head on a ship).   I never applied to BOOST, but had a ROTC package railroaded through by my recruiting district's officer recruiter because of my high ADSVAB and advanced classes in high school. I DEPEd in at the end of my junior year to be a nuke. I found out I had been selected to BOOST during the breakfast after Battle Stations in boot camp and had 1 day to decide whether to go to Nuke ET a school or Newport. After talking to my Senior Chief and future wife I decided to head to BOOST.   I thought the classes were pretty easy being straight out of high school, it was like doing my senior year again.  The faculty were all civilian teachers with some being Naval reserve officers too (shout out to CAPT Rick Rigazzio USNR who was a great math teacher even though he was a submariner). The rest of the staff were pretty good too, a mix bag of Navy and MC officers and a chief per company.   Being the junior guy, I got a lot of the shit jobs- waxing decks, snow shoveling, color detail on that huge 50ft flag in the middle of winter. I was an E3 at the time, and their were a couple E2s and E3s that had been directly entered BOOST as civilians. The civilians that couldn't cut it got a discharge.   I was about 2 months from graduating when I was brought up on plagiarism charges by my English teacher. A guy had copied my homework journal on the computer we had been using and it is a 2 party crime.  I couldn't get the investigating officer to believe me that I didn't know about it so that was my first Captain's Mass. I was dis-enrolled and sent out to the fleet as a deck seaman.  Now I'm a couple years away from retiring as a BMC, so the Navy hasn't been that bad to me.   One thing I thought was weird is the OIC at the time was Major Binns.

I wound up working 100 hour work weeks, alternating shifts noon to 2000 and 2000 to 0400. To make things worse, I'd have to stay after work once a week from 0400 until my duty section muster at 0700. It all that isn't bad enough, about 1/3rd of the people doing my job were useless. But, there was nothing I could do. All the stress was piling up, and my coworkers and I were drinking ourselves to sleep (not to mention the other medical issues due to shift work). I had never felt more powerless. It was hands down the worst is ever felt. So, I started seeing our command psychologist. He didn't really help that much, it was just nice to have someone to talk to.   Listen, you're not the first person in the navy to get depressed, and you won't be the last. You have very little control over your life, and that sucks.

Every honorable discharge is administrative, so too are general discharges and other than honorable discharges. The honorable, general, other than honorable part? Those are service characterizations.  Punitive discharges are awarded at a court martial and are either bad conduct or dishonorable discharges.

While I agree with you to a point, yes It can create a problem in that it makes it easier for those with malicious intent to accomplish their goals,  but allowing those with good intent and training who wish to protect to bring their weapons alleviates a lot of the problem it creates.  At least those with bad intent would know that hey even if I get through security I can't just go and shoot at people expecting them to be unarmed.    Also,  have you seen some of these MA's?

The bulk of the bun shall not exceed 3 inches when measured from the scalp and the diameter of the bun will not exceed 4 inches.  Loose ends must be tucked in and secured.   Angled hairstyles will have no more than a 1-1/2 inch difference between the front and the back length of hair.  Layered hairstyles are authorized provided layers present a smooth and graduated appearance.   Hair length shall be sufficient to prevent the scalp from being readily visible (with the exception of documented medical conditions).   Two individual braids.  One braid worn on each side of the head, uniform in dimension and no more than one inch in diameter.  Each braid extends from the front to back of the head near the lower portion of the hair line (i.e., braids are closer to the top of the ear than the top of the head to prevent interference with wearing of headgear).    A single French braid may be worn starting near the top of the head and be braided to the end of the hair.  The end of the braid must be secured to the head and braid placement shall be down the middle of the back of the head.  The intent is for pinned-up hair to be styled in a manner that prevents loose ends from extending upward or outward from the head.  For example, when using barrettes or hairpins, hair will not extend loosely from the head; when hair is in a bun, all loose ends must be tucked in and secured.   Hair restraining devices, if worn, will be consistent with the current hair color."

Example: your engine seizes 8 miles from airport X. The T-6b can glide 2 miles for every 1000' and the airport elevation is 100' AGL. What altitude do you need to be to reach high key (3000' AGL)?   8 nm/2 nm per 1000'= 4000 ft   4000' + 3000' (high key) + 100' (elevation) = 7100'

My LT was a former Naval Aviator and I served on a carrier.  The most important thing I can tell you is that you cannot even for a second take your foot of the gas.  The second you relax your efforts to get there, someone will pass you.  Also, when I was in Pensacola for training I was on hold status for 6 months trying to get re-cleared for flight status and I was the duty driver for the API students (future Naval Aviators) and essentially because they finished at the top of their classes in academics and athletics, etc., they were able to get into the officer program they wanted (aviation).  I also know that having a relevant major is an incredible boost to your ""resume"" and increases your chances, which is why I switched mine from English to Engineering."

navy,3dhd1w,HoHSarkhon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:22:14 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Seaman to Admiral.  When pronouncing it on the ship, nobody ever knew what I was talking about (when I first got there), but I started hearing it pronounced 'State' and kind of just adopted it... may be a more common thing than just my ship, maybe not... I was on the Enterprise, nothing they did was normal."
navy,3dhd1w,smokinglamp_throw,3,Thu Jul 16 08:30:58 2015 UTC,"Carriers are weird.  EDIT: I'm still confused.  It's pronounced ""stay 21"" all over the fleet, but where did the second ""T"" come from on your ship?  Furthermore, if you knew it was being mispronounced, why would you type it here out as though the misspelling were correct?  Carriers are weird."
navy,3dhd1w,HoHSarkhon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:34:00 2015 UTC,"Bad habit.  On my specific ship, in my specific division when I got my eval and they marked it STA-21, my 1st class pronounced it, ""State 21"".  Every time we spoke about it while I was working through the process, she would continue to pronounce it that way, and so I started to think that STA-21 (Seaman to Admiral) was just the abbreviation used to fit it in the recommended programs box on the eval.  A few other sailors called it State-21, presumably for similar reasons.    To summarize, 1st class called it State-21 over and over, I picked it up and thought it was legit, was later corrected but damage was done and now I sometimes slip and will even type State-21 if I'm not paying 100% attention to detail."

Are you willing to take a major hit in your social life in pursuit of these goals?  Lose a girlfriend?   If you badly want to fly (especially if you want the platform of your choice) you need to start excelling at everything you do and place the navy first in your life.

The thought that the Navy somehow requires technical majors is simply a myth.  Sure, they probably view a 2.5 GPA in Rocket Science differently than a 2.5 in PoliSci, but simply being a History major will not hurt anyone's chances.  Like all things, if they do well at it then it'll help them and if they don't do well it'll hinder them.   If you badly want to fly (especially if you want the platform of your choice) you need to start excelling at everything you do and place the navy first in your life.   Again, no.  The selection process is about as much random chance as it is your ability.  If someone is coming out of primary, really wants jets, but there are no jet spots for his class...well then no one is getting jets no matter how well they did.

YMMV   I was told 6 months ago that my orders would be extended another year  PRD date would be in 2017   Ok I'm confused now. What was your original PRD? If it was early 2016, then you should be selecting orders now, as the typical selection time is about 9 months from your PRD. Now, you're getting extended. That should give you some extra time. However, there seems to be underlying details that are missing."

The one issue comes is if security clearance investigators decide to pop around and ask some questions to family / friends. What if that one guy a while back goes like ""Oh yeah I totally shot the shit up with him/her all the time""? They find out you're lying, you're out.  The second way is you're honest. Let them know it was stupid shit you did, and that you haven't since who knows when. You'll have to obtain a waiver, and the risk there is that the waiver doesn't go through.

navy,3das4k,Bircher,5,Tue Jul 14 22:19:53 2015 UTC,"There are generally no permanently assigned DOD personnel on the continent.  There is a small Air Force contingent that runs C-17's down to the ice from Christchurch New Zealand, and specially modified C-130's for resupply missions to remote stations (some US, some international) on the continent itself.  The Coast Guard also provides a small contingent for logistics/icebreaking operations.  MSC also runs supplies down to McMurdo station from time to time on the USNS ships.  All of these operations take place during the ""summer"" months. Once ""winter"" rolls around down there, there is ZERO traffic on or off the continent (unless it's a life/death medevac, these can't really be guaranteed either due to weather). After the last flight out, there is a huge drunken party to celebrate.   There is sometimes a small contingent of ET's/IT's that stay down there for ET/IT stuff. Nothing nefarious, they just need to keep all the gear running to land the planes/talk to supply ships/some SATCOM stuff. They usually try and keep these positions staffed with civilians, but if they can't come up with a body, they will billet DOD people down there. Occasionally you will have some O-4/O-5 officer from some branch down there doing some type of research towards their PhD.  There used to be a small full time Navy contingent down there up until the 70's, to run the nuclear reactor they built. The Navy kind of fucked that away and irradiated a whole bunch of people. Now there is no reactor/full time DOD contingent down there.  Source: Before the Navy, I had been offered a job by Raytheon to work down there. When I was doing my medical/psych evals, I got to spend several days interacting with several dozen people that had spent 10+ years on the job down there. I chose bootcamp instead. I'm still thinking about going down there this year once I'm a civilian again. Imagine a 9 month deployment with 8-10 hour work days, no watches, real beds and the ability to drink every day (no port visits though). It's an insanely tight knit group with some really interesting stories to tell."

navy,3dbnuq,yomandenver,2,Wed Jul 15 11:23:50 2015 UTC,"Talk to your instructors, specifically look for the ones with their surface pin.  Google ESWS.    If you're having an issue getting one to give you some solid info, shoot me a message.  I'll get you in contact with one of the guys in the barracks."
navy,3dbnuq,BlackSquirrel05,2,Wed Jul 15 02:55:01 2015 UTC,They always need FMF... Even if it is overmanned. (Fucking med BN screws the numbers on that I think) But 0000 are also overmanned.   Here's where you need to do some thinking. What do you want long term? If you're just going to get out and go to school then do whatever.   If you want a job... You need to get an NEC. Basic HM doesn't land you any decent job on the outside. (If someone says MA I'll slap them! That job pays like 15/hr if you're lucky.)
navy,3dbnuq,Julian256,2,Wed Jul 15 13:43:21 2015 UTC,They very very rarely put corpsman straight out of a school on ships. The whole time I was there I met 2 people that were gonna go to ships and 1 of them got their orders changed

The Navy doesn't have an open spot everywhere at any time. People leave places all the time. As spots begin to open up, then you can apply to go there. If you're gonna be a 0000 or 8404, you can go almost anywhere. If you specialize/ get an NEC, then your window of orders narrows down even more so.  So to answer your question, your chances of going to a division or ship aren't impossible, but don't expect to get them straight off. Spots need to get filled often."
navy,3dbnuq,Antares777,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:23:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll go to a FFG, pretty sure they're all getting decommissioned by the end of the year, if they're not already, mine decommissioned in 2013. But on a DDG, corpsman have it pretty good, no underway watch. There are plenty of people every day at sick call (from my experience at least), some of which are are people who are actually sick, and some of which who are at sick call every single day with a new problem."

I will make sure he knows - this was my gut feeling, but I didn't really want that to be the first thing out of my mouth when he told me.   As hard as it is to believe, he's not a stupid person. This whole situation started from scratch 8 weeks ago, and would be laughably ironic, except it's not really laughable."

You can recommend he go to Fleet and Family, you can recommend he talk more to Chaps and Chief. But you have no real recourse other than to try to tell the kid what an idiot he is if he's seriously considering marriage. And, since he's your friend, you probably won't do that.  If you want to help, tell your Chief or some other petty officer in your chain of command that you think he needs some counseling. Other than that... His life to screw up.  PS - Tell the doofus to get a paternity test before he pays for anything. You can get roped into paying for the next two decades by setting a precedent even if you're not the dad."

Secondly, I agree with you. I think it is a ridiculous situation and I don't think marriage is the right option. I just want solid advice to give him so he doesn't rush in and make a decision that's going to affect more than it should."

Not going to type a wall of text but if you have any questions feel free to PM me.  Our school is not hard at all. If you have even a slight inclination or interest in anything technical or any experience you will have no trouble and be bored most of the time.  Our rate is extremely diverse. I'd say we have more possible in-rate knowledge than any other rate by far. You will never know everything, but you can pick an area that interests you and learn enough about it to stand out from the crowd.  As for orders, there are ITs at every single command in the world as far as I know, which means we can go anywhere. Our possible orders are extremely diverse"

Like the other user said, IT is extremely diverse, but for the most part you'll either be responsible for upkeep of communications networks or general sysadmin type of work.  A & C school are not overly difficult, provided that you're willing to put in the work. Don't get to school and all of a sudden get stupid because you've got some liberty. Square yourself away first and foremost, THEN enjoy your free time as it suites you.   I will say, that if I wish I'd done anything different to prepare for the beginning, it'd be this: P.T."

The TSP funds are pretty competitive with the with other index funds but their expense ratio is a lot less.   If you are an economic genius and want to pick individual stocks or funds to invest with, go IRA. Or if you're not an economic genius, go TSP.   Most of us don't have the time or knowledge to beat the S&P 500 so I recommend the TSP. It's free to invest and the work is done for you."

As far as the TSP vs IRA goes, the TSP has a higher contribution limit, and the expense ratios are much lower than most funds you'd be able find on the market.

When you're done with military service you can transfer your tsp into your Roth if you pay the taxes on it. Pretty good deal IMO.

Basically anything that has any bit of relevance to the Navy will make it easier for the person presenting your package to the board.   As as E4 and under all you should need to do is give your inputs to your LPO/WCS but as a reservist they might not have full awareness of what you do so they need more assistance.

This will get chopped several times before it becomes a package and then most of the stuff gets thrown away and the best gets jammed in a few lines of an LOA between a lot of mandatory wording.  If you have trouble thinking of what to include think Command, Service, Community, Self. What have you done for your command, what have you done to better the Navy, what have you done that helps the community, and how have you improved yourself?

If you plan on staying in the Navy long enough, you can try to apply for IPAP to get your PA, but like most things its competitive. Not to mention civilian PA school isn't exactly a cake walk to get in. I don't mean to presume, but it sounds like you don't know a lot about what PAs do.

Which means when grouped against your peers you'll either over perform or under perform.  People seem to think that boom 1-2 years of treatment therapy and everything is different... No it's not. (Don't forget that person being biologically different for say decades before hand) Not only that but in your transition period what do you do? Go no deployable? PRT wavier for what is still an elective procedure?   IOC be damned (They're a quasi political organization that needs to have a certain public perception, and that's great for them. However this isn't the Olympics.) there isn't enough research out on trans people and athletics. Guess the military might be the true test on whether there are differences after the fact or how impactful they really are."
navy,3d6z17,JCY2K,5,Tue Jul 14 15:07:55 2015 UTC,"Or do you respect trans* people and their gender identity. Trans-men (assigned female at birth) would do the male PRT and trans-women (assigned male at birth) would do the female PRT. Same with uniforms and bathrooms. Anything else is dehumanizing and insulting.  Edit to add: to compete in the Olympics, trans* people have to be living in their gender for a year, including hormone therapy. If it's good enough to figure out who the world's best athletes are, it should be enough to sort people for the PRT."

It's going to be a logistical nightmare, and everyone is trying to argue individual pros and cons, but no one can say it's not going to be trying for the entire process to fit them into barracks and berthings smoothly.

navy,3d6z17,JCY2K,0,Wed Jul 15 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"My point, which may not have been well put was that just because something may cause some people some discomfort doesn't mean it has to be detrimental to the mission I wasn't in when DADT was repealed. Was that disruptive to the mission? I wasn't around when women started serving on surface ships. Was that disruptive to the mission? I certainly wasn't in when the services were racially integrated. Was that disruptive to the mission?  Being transgender isn't the same as waking up in the morning and saying ""I feel girly today."" Berthing would be by a person's recognized gender, just like it is now."
navy,3d6z17,SuperNixon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:40:05 2015 UTC,"I wasn't around for putting women on ships or racial integration, so i can't really comment on that too much, but as far as the gays...living that close to another person really reveals a lot. You pretty much knew who was gay already under DADT and it was more so of a way for the government to cover it's ass from discrimination lawsuits.  So it wasn't that disruptive to the mission.    Trans though is going to be different because it's primarily going to be women who are going to have a decrease in quality of life. They're the ones who are going to have to suck up having someone with a penis in their berthings and be made to feel uncomfortable in their living spaces. That's not even to mention how they're going to handle the PRT and the animosity that's going to create.  It's going to be a shit show in trying to set a double standard for trans women and women, while maintaining political correctness.  Ultimately, my question to all of this is why do we need a military with trans people in it? Are we running out of sailors and soldiers? I don't see the inherent gain in changing every ship, base, and regulation in the world to accommodate less than 1% of the population. The military doesn't select who can join off of who it likes, but off of logistics, and having to rewrite everything for a small percentage of the population seems mildly ridiculous. It's not discrimination to not let people in with asthma diabetics, and i don't understand why it's discrimination to not have trans people meet the logistical parameters of the military."
navy,3d6z17,JCY2K,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:48:56 2015 UTC,"Your post seems to imply that trans people aren't already serving. They are. Over 15,000 of them. Here's one's story. If how we run the PRT is the biggest issue in all of this, it'll be an easy day. As an aside, I think it's funny that PRT is the thing everyone goes to. In the face of everything, it's such a minor part of service life.   Ultimately, my question to all of this is why do we need a military with trans people in it? Are we running out of sailors and soldiers?   What distinguishes that argument from asking in 1971 ""why do we need a military with women in it? Are we running out of soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen?""   It's not discrimination to not let people in with asthma diabetics, and i don't understand why it's discrimination to not have trans people meet the logistical parameters of the military.   Because the people you're pointing to excluding hamper that ability to do the mission. A diabetic (insulin dependent) without medicine that needs refrigeration falls into a coma; you may not get that in an operational environment. An asthmatic who loses their inhaler or runs out of juice for the same won't be able to run. For hormone therapy, trans people take a pill or two a day (or a shot once a week) and without it, suffer no debilitating effects."

navy,3d6z17,JCY2K,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:20:47 2015 UTC,"We need them for the same reason we need more than a white male protestant service. Because diversity gives us strength. And because there's nothing wrong with them. I wouldn't be in the traditional Navy (say the Navy of 1850) because I'm not Christian. One of the best chiefs I know wouldn't because they're gay. Our LPO – who is a rock star – wouldn't be in because she's a woman. My XO is half Japanese and wouldn't be in either. I think my unit of about 75 would be reduced to about 12 if we had to fit 1850s Navy standards of who should be able to be a sailor. What it means to be a sailor has always been in flux and refusing the historical animus against another group does much to (1) further our core values and (2) represent all possible of America's voices in America's Navy. This also means that we get better work done because more viewpoints are represented.  Also, I dispute the question. We shouldn't have to ask ""why let them in"" about any group; not people of color, not gay people, not women. The question is and should be ""why keep them out"" and the rapidly evolving consensus is that there is no good reason to keep trans people out. This is coming from the President, the Secretary of Defense and a blue-ribbon commission of former generals and other experts.  Because asthma isn't a protected class (and no one is saying it should be) while gender identity is. And because accommodating trans people requires radically less modification to who we are and what we do than an insulin-dependent diabetic or an asthmatic. Neither of those people are worldwide deployable while trans people are (including those like Sgt. Shane Ortega who were mid-transition when deployed to a forward environment)."
navy,3d6z17,SuperNixon,-2,Wed Jul 15 05:35:01 2015 UTC,"Because asthma isn't a protected class (and no one is saying it should be) while gender identity is.   This is the crutch of your entire argument. We should let them in because there is something inherently valuable about having trans people that doesn't exist with the other medical conditions that everyone is fine with excluding.   Why aren't diabetics or asthmatics world wide deployable? It's certainly logistically possible, we already have refrigerators and freezers on ships, and we get our food often enough for fresh veggies, but why don't we? When i was out last year a kid break his arm, and he was to the doctor on the carrier in less than 2 hours. Certainly the same could be said for someone having an a asthma attack or going into diabetic shock.  Hell if we really wanted to we could probably put wheel chair ramps and elevators on all of the ladderwells to just carry them up and down. So why don't we? Why should they be excluded?    I am just letting you know that i don't think that a trans person would be any better or any worse than anyone else at their job. I don't think they would do any worse at shooting a gun or turning a wrench.  All i think is that it's a medical condition and should be treated as much. Not that they are crazy or anything like that, just a medical condition. That's my disclaimer and i am sticking to it.    This also means that we get better work done because more viewpoints are represented.   This is complete propaganda to make you feel better about yourself and actually opposite of what the navy actually does. Think about it, every aspect of your life is completely controlled and regulated down to having a procedure for everything. From leading the troops to changing a toilet, there is only one way of doing it, and that's the controlled, navy way. That's why there is chief 365,  instructor school,  recruiter school, or even napkin folding school,  it's so that you don't think for yourselves. Hell, what do you do when an MRC is wrong? You stop, and send in a report on it instead of just doing the gist of it; it could be the easiest check in the world but if two steps are out of order, then you have to stop and send in a report.  Nobody can change the system, that's why there is a system.  All of that's done to kill diverse viewpoints."

Secondly, many other countries, Canada included, already allow openly trans troops, and it hasn't been a problem.    It's about how transgenders are literally defined as having a mental disorder.   This is not true. The APA makes it very clear that being transgender is not a mental disorder.

I'm guessing there are articles out there that talk about it in more depth than the one above but I don't know of any good ones.  All the more, trans people are twice as likely to serve as their cisgender counterparts. 20% of trans people who responded to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (which is about all parts of life and asks about military service as part of demographic information collection) served while only 10% of the general population have. Source.   If they had the surgery wouldn't the doctor who did it legally have to notify the US military even if the person paid out of pocket?    NO. Quite the opposite. Under HIPAA, the doctor would face all kind of penalties for telling the military.

Pensacola you probably know more about as I only know what I know because of being at Corry.  Fort Meade is like the best of 7 bad options. The negatives are annoying, but not deal breaking for me. I might put Fort Gordon (georgia) or Pensacola (depending on you) above it.   Meade has a slow chain of command. It's has a ton of traffic.

navy,3d62eo,SuperNixon,4,Tue Jul 14 00:06:02 2015 UTC,"Hey man, i know how you feel. When i was in holds after C school, I was alone and isolated without anyone or anything.  I ended up losing my orders literally during the ceremony and then was just left in a small remote base without anyone i knew or talked to. I was given to the grounds keeping department and i am not making this up, literally moving the same pile of rocks around the base day in and day out when there wasn't other work to do.  The MM1 who was in charge (i was not an MM, or an engineer at all) thought that we had to have work to do regardless if there was any or not. So on days that there wasn't toilets to clean or grass to mow, I would move rocks until sunset. Every fucking day i would move rocks by hand, get sweaty and dirty, only to go back to my barracks room to spend the night alone.  I was in a dark place and the only thing that saved me was eventually getting orders after two months.  Let me tell you what i wish someone was there to tell me, first i know it sucks.  First thing that you're going to need to do is hit the gym, go running, or whatever. Getting into a routine with physical exercise will help you immensely;  it clears your head and will make things a little better.  Just go put on some headphones and hit the gym.  It doesn't matter if you like it or are really don't a good job, as long as you leave there tired it will have done its purpose.  Then go talk to your psychologist and tell them what you're feeling. They're not going to kick you out, but they can certainly help you as a liaison to your chain of command to help you either get out of the base or moved to a different department.  They understand that being isolated is going to wear on people and that some people just aren't built for it.  I am sure that your Chief is whatever, but you haven't talked to the captain yet. That's your right to request COs mast to talk to the captain if there is a problem. It's not NJP nor will it go on your record, but if it's that big of a deal write all of your feelings down and look into requesting to talk to the old man, trust me he/she will listen.  You can PM me if you need to and i will respond, i feel terrible for you.  Good luck"

navy,3d60qz,flashbang4you,5,Mon Jul 13 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"There are a variety of programs to become a Navy physician.  You can go to undergrad at a ROTC school and get in to their program and try for a scholarship and then go to medical school.  For medical school you can use HPSP for college costs, and that includes some extra money for living expenses, and then you have to apply for a Navy residency, although there is a slim chance of a deferral to a civilian program.  You could go to medical school on your own (although this plan I think you'd also have to undergrad on your own, not ROTC) and then apply as a resident for, I believe it's called FAP, which pays back some student loans and provides some living money.  Or you can do all your school on your own and apply as a practicing physician and get at least some money for student loans.  That option allows you to apply for either active duty or reserves.  The last way is to do undergrad (ROTC or on your own) and then apply to USUHS where you will go on active duty and get paid full salary and benefits while going to the military medical school tuition free.  This has a much longer pay back and you have to do a military residency.  However, if money is your primary motivation it's a terrible, terrible idea.  Unless you pick a low paying speciality you'll never even come close to coming out ahead financially in the military, and the vast majority of military physicians leave after their initial obligation.  There is a reason for that as a lot (but obviously not all) are unhappy in military medicine and leave for much higher pay and more freedom in civilian practice with less bureaucracy.  Only go the military route if you want to be in the military, otherwise just take out some (lots) of loans and pay them off in a few years as an attending.  Also just an FYI, enlisting is different from a commission.  Officers, which include physicians, are commissioned and enter in a different process and have a different role and authority in the military.  Avoid actually enlisting if medical school is what you want to do as that will just add time to the entire process for limited/no gain."
navy,3d60qz,justatouchcrazy,6,Mon Jul 13 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"i am a Navy physician.  I went the HPSP route. You were spot on except for the paragraph about money and motivation. I think you may have over simplified it because the money is really not horrible with other considerations taken into account (paid a lot more as an intern and resident than civilian counterpart without the student loans).  The bureaucracy of the military is obviously an issue for some.  I would also argue for some of the military specific benefits of being a military doc.  Increased autonomy, exposure to an area of medicine with historical significance and the ability to receive training not available to civilians.  I would be willing to bet my mortgage that I have had medical training and experience that 95% of the practicing population has never had and never will. Then there is the cool hooyah stuff they can actually pay you to do like dive school, airborne parachutist, etc..."
navy,3d60qz,miketopia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess that's a personal motivation thing and what they've been able to get out of the military.  I'm in the OR, and a lot of the surgeons I'm working with are unhappy because either they never really did the GMO tour/interesting stuff and are now making far less than an orthopedic or subspecialty surgeon can make on the outside, or are burned out from frequent deployments or micromanagement.  Same with many of my EM friends to a lesser extent, except for the more adventurous ones that hate the hospital and love being in the field with the Marines, even if less often practicing medicine.  On the flip side a lot of the family practice physicians I know, especially that did a GMO tour or three, have nothing but good things to say.  I know when I was deciding on nurse anesthesia school I spent a lot of time considering medical school instead, just so I could be a GMO and do all the cool stuff the Nurse Corps largely don't have a similar opportunity to do.  My consideration with that option had almost nothing to do with the practice of medicine though."

navy,3d60qz,miketopia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:20:23 2015 UTC,"I can't speak intelligently on that kind of FAP but I have been very happy with HPSP. It is more competitive now (I think) and they are starting to make more people go straight through residency like Army and Air Force, but I would still say Navy is a good option. I am biased. I'm 4th generation Navy, so I gave little thought to other services.   But back to HPSP, as lot depends on where you go to school. For example, I went to med school in southern California. The stipend did not cover rent, let alone food, gas, and other stuff. But in a more affordable area, the stipend may stretch further. Also, having your school be familiar with HPSPers is a bonus. Honestly, my best advice would be to get accepted into medical school (just that easy) and then ask that school to hook you up with someone in the HPSP program. Then you can get all the neurotic questions and minutia unfit for Reddit answered."

navy,3d7mf4,Usnavy_revolt,3,Tue Jul 14 03:39:04 2015 UTC,Have you reported it in your sf86 under known foreigners? No need to mention legal status it just asks for name and contact info of foreigners you are in contact with.  I do not speak with authority on this but the people doing your investigation probably aren't concerned with doing INSs job for them they just want to evaluate your trustworthiness.  This is definitely a tricky subject   but hiding something from them WILL bite you in the end.
navy,3d7mf4,NapoleonX,4,Tue Jul 14 04:16:58 2015 UTC,"This. It is not necessarily a disqualifier for you, but trying to hide it certainly would be. A friend of mine was married to a foreign national (strong US ally, but nevertheless) and his TS/SCI still went through.   There are 13 factors that they look at during an SSBI. Finances, drug and alcohol use/abuse, and foreign connections are a few. They use a ""whole person"" concept, so knowing or being related to a foreign national probably won't sink you.

navy,3d7mf4,Moops79,3,Tue Jul 14 13:27:21 2015 UTC,From which country?
navy,3d7mf4,eskeTrixa,3,Tue Jul 14 03:47:56 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming Mexico is the country, which is low tier risk per ICD 704.  Generally that won't disqualify you from  TS/SCI clearance depending on how often you have contact with the foreign national or his ties to his country of origin's govt.  However, the 6+ month investigation/wait before your clearance is approved may be disqualifying.  Talk to your CCC about it.    Be advised that most investigation initiations are currently on hold for the next 6+ weeks due to E-QIP website maintenance."

They will pull historical records from your city hall...talk to your teachers..all your direct references...people you don't know. I will give to you the very words a man in a suit in a dark room gave to a young man many years ago.  ""Mr. Last Name Here, we're not looking for saints or sinners.

navy,3d5z73,CaliMade19XX,3,Tue Jul 14 12:59:00 2015 UTC,"Navy wife here, my husband has been in for two years this august and has shore duty which makes things a hell of a lot easier for now, sure the shifts are lengthy and you don't have long after they get home to spend time together before it's time to sleep but you have to have a plan. We usually take a couple hours to talk and what not and maybe watch a movie. While he's at work it kind of gives me time to do things I enjoy, also some time to miss him. Communication is a do or die factor for this lifestyle and if that's hard for you to do then you're going to have a bad time.  Although, it IS lonely. There's no way to sugar coat it for the spouses, it's going to be a lot of time mostly spent by yourself. So I don't think its unusual in some cases that we want to practically jump into our partners arms when we're able to actually spend time together. I get it, some spouses get super needy and clingy, some girls are just like that I suppose but you also have to take into account that besides the friends we have temporarily, you're all we got!  But let me tell you one thing, if you can find yourself a girl that is willing to leave everything they know just for you that is something to appreciate because it takes a lot of courage to just pack your bags and drop them in a whole new state/country/etc not knowing anyone or anything. I won't lie, leaving my family was absolutely heart wrenching for me personally  and I cried 5 hours straight on my flight but I can definitely say it has molded me into the wife I am today. But shit, I'm ready to go back to california already. Praying we get orders next month.  :("
navy,3d5z73,TheBeneGesseritWitch,7,Tue Jul 14 04:06:38 2015 UTC,"Not a nuke, but Mr. BGW and I spend a significant amount of time away from each other. Having a relationship like ours really requires a lot of work. My parents have been married over 30 years and when I asked how she does it she said ""you have to love intentionally."" Some of our ""loving intentionally"" tricks include....   Find activities to do together despite distance. We take turns picking a movie, or book, or TV show to watch ""together."" This means when we do talk, we aren't grasping around for a question that is different than ""what'd you do today?"" Cause underway--you do the same thing. Every day. Over and over. Groundhog's Day. It's hard to connect when your only story is about your obnoxious watch-standing partner or that your watch relief was an hour later.  Plan ahead for when you'll be gone. If you know you'll miss a birthday or anniversary, leave a wrapped gifted ""to be opened on the date"" ....bonus if you manage to hide it from your SO somewhere in the house until that date.  Leave your SO something to do when you're stuck on duty--""take this envelope and go to your favorite coffee shop, the one off Tidewater"" and in it put money for your SO's lunch, and a a customized word search or crossword puzzle where all the clues are about you two (where you met, ya'll's favorite movie/date spot/date meal). Leave a note to the effect of ""I wish I could spend this time with you, but since I'm stuck on duty, know that I'm thinking about you. I hope you enjoy this ""date"" without me.""    Creativity here is a must.  Communication. Oh you have no idea just how important this skill is. Communication, communication, communication. And I'm not just talking about ""what you did today"" type of communication where the conversation fizzles off because you just have nothing in common to talk about while you're deployed, but learning how to bring up problems in a healthy way, learning how to share fears and concerns and frustrations to work toward a solution together is critical. So critical that I would encourage you, if you think it could become a problem, to get counseling together. Learning how to say ""I feel XYZ when you do ABC, can you please help me,"" is very different than ""You always do ABC and you never do XYZ!"""

But we also had a guy majoring in Spanish who applied. The helping or hurting comes from the application process. There is an in person technical interview process that he wasn't able to pass very well because he didn't have the skills in calculus and physics.

He even tried to force it on the Engineers, but the Chief Engineer (CHENG) fought that shit, and got them their coveralls back.  It should be noted, that in the USN, we have normal coveralls which most commands now let their sailors wear underway, now that the NWU hype is gone, but Engineering, or personnel that work below decks, have always had a special set of superior ""Flame Resistant"" coveralls, for the purpose of their work. Obviously.  When did the Navy officially quit wearing the NWU underway?  I saw the article on how they were not flame resistant, which made me laugh as I use to do GQ all the time in that uniform, our entire ship did.  This was in 2010-2012ish."

But what you can expect when you get out to sea is a 4-6 hour watch (or two, depending on how manned your ship is) sitting in front of the SONAR console, probably an hour or two of training, 2 hours of cleaning something, some maintenance, some time spent working on quals, maybe an array deployment/retrieval and maybe some sleep. (Actually my days aren't much different, 'cept the cleaning.) As a rule, working hours are from 0700-1600 in port, and kind of the same at sea, but really anything goes there and watches are 24/7/365. We're manned about right, promotion is okay, but not easy. You have to try. STG is great for someone who likes computers, solitude, being cold, and not getting dirty. Lots of numbers, formulas and memorization. ASW is hours of routine, boring, tiny, almost imperceptible changes followed (sometimes, hope not) by five to ten minutes of pure adrenaline. Honestly, quite a few of us are the geeky gamer type. Our displays look like the matrix. Mere mortals don't understand them. General advice? Do well in school. Try hard. You are in school for the learning, not the drama. Listen to your instructors, ask questions and follow advice. And when you can choose orders, come to Japan. Real, no-shit ASW here every day. The only place where we do our job constantly. Most STGs never leave Japan until forced because the job is awesome here. Ask me anything - I've been doing this for 19 years now so I've been around the block a time or two."
navy,3d3mfw,Poopkitty,4,Mon Jul 13 10:29:45 2015 UTC,"Feeling all of this advice.  If you are a 6 year guy who will be a technician, be sure to keep your class notes (as applicable) and take them with you to the fleet as more times than not, they will aid you in troubleshooting.  That spiral bound notebook saved my bacon many times even as a mid/senior level technician.  Be flexible as the reduced need for sub hunting means that STGs are often picked for other work/side jobs.  Also know your CORE is finding submarines.  You should know what every single button on every console does and when to use them and when to not.  Oddly enough, some of the best manuals in STG land are the 19/53/28 operations manuals in the secret safe on the ship.  They are written for dummies and if you know when to push Button A in Scenario X....you will look like a rockstar as MOST sonar guys learn via ""monkey see-monkey do"" vice what is in the manual.  My nickname on my first ship was ""Data"" because I spent so much time in that secret safe.  When I walked into sonar during an actual event, people parted like the Red Sea so I could get on a console...this is the aura you want to have as the biggest badass sonar operator on the boat."

navy,3d3mfw,Sountox,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:50 2015 UTC,"ITASS.  Started as a 4yo with a great or dumb workcenter sup who gave me Nixie as ""my"" system with zero electronics skill.  With help I eventually fixed it many times which made me go to C school mid career to become a real tech.  I remember the first time Nixie broke and I troubleshot it to like a $25,000 part.  My WCS, shrugged and ordered the part without even looking at my work.  Part came in, I installed it and it worked like crazy.  Did the same to a buddy in later years and he's a Chief in the fleet now.  Dem feels..."
navy,3d3mfw,Unabomber007,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:57:37 2015 UTC,I always loved ITASS I went to school for it originally but things happened and I had to go to 56 instead :(
navy,3d3mfw,Sountox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:22:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this has helped a lot. Another thing I was wondering is if this job can be transitioned over to the private sector? This is much farther down the line, but a reason I joined the Navy was to obtain a useful skill. Do you know anyone that has taken his experience and been able to get a job after his time in the Navy?"
navy,3d3mfw,Unabomber007,2,Tue Jul 14 02:25:38 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  I retired in 2009 and could have taken any number of a few jobs once out, but really didn't.  My first job out was working at the facility in Little Creek, VA (now moved to Rhode Island) which repairs all the sonar arrays (sub, surface, SURTASS) and I inspected the work of the workers upon each step of the repair.  It paid shit.  There are a few training jobs in the civilian sector but they are generally for people who have been to instructor duty.  If you are a technician, the training translates into many electronics fields as shore based sonar specific technicans that support the fleet or general electronics jobs, but these are mostly $60,000 a year jobs or thereabouts.  Also a factor is your education as each degree level should bump up your pay, so if you get out with no degree, you are looking at slightly north of $50k.  With a degree or two, a touch more.  If this pay level is fine, sally forth, but if you want to make more you should really invest in something different like software development (my new bag) or perhaps project management.  I've had 5 jobs since retiring in 2009 with 0 days not working with all of them leveraging my Navy background, degrees (once I got them), and a dash of dumb luck by keeping my ear to the ground and letting everyone know I'm always looking.  Keeping in touch with old and current work/navy friends is a huge key....I've only gotten one job through ""want ads"" and that was my first sonar repair job through General Dynamics."

He had been getting somewhat aggressive in trying to convert people (encourage them to embrace Jesus, lecture about the sins of the flesh or something like that). He had a rather large wodden cross that he kept on his bunk, and would hold and kiss whenever he prayed. So, a bunch of people went to his bunk, took his cross and took turns peeing on it. They then washed it under water (but left the smell). When he got off watch, he went to his bunk and took the cross and began praying. He stopped for a moment when the smell hit him, but hen continued on with holding and kissing the cross.

Second time I reenlisted it was because I realized, like /u/club41 that I wanted that pension for life. That, if I continued to make wise financial choices, I could opt not to work once I retired from the Navy.  The secondary factors were: I was already active duty for so long that the second reenlistment was ""okay, you're already in for life,"" I was at a place where I could take college classes, the Navy had started to get  really fun (at E5), my detailer offered me shore duty overseas, and my husband asked me to stay in (that whole debt for school thing). (note: this was before we had a kid. Now that we have offspring we're reconsidering both of us staying active duty, but we've gone so far that we might as well just suck it up for a few more years).   My two cents--take that shore duty, and go overseas if possible. Also, use your shore duty to get hot on college. If you don't want to stay in for life, that's cool, get out! But make sure you are as prepared as you can be! Don't waste a free resource. Also! Get plugged into a program that makes you feel good about contributing to your community. Don't just do community service to do it, but, like, okay I got to teach the Boy Scouts out here how to weld. I haven't had that much fun doing community service in years. Yeah, I'm a girl, but they still let me teach these 8th grade boys basic shop safety and how to weld. They thought it was the coolest thing in the world.

My career goals could have been still achieved in the Navy, but they would have pushed my goals back 3 years minimum, but I was going from shore to sea duty. You have a long way to a pension and you got to think what you would do career wise without it. When working LIMDU I saw individuals with 16-17 years get medically separated with no pension and no future career plans. If your future career can be achieved or helped by staying in the Navy and you enjoy the culture sign up. If either of those are no then you might want to look in to schools."

navy,3cx3ew,kbustera,6,Sat Jul 11 20:30:29 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. Illegality of prostitution in the local jurisdiction is not an element of a 134 charge for solicitation."

navy,3cx3ew,kbustera,10,Sat Jul 11 23:14:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a JAG and I'm telling you how the DoD views it. This comes from the Manual for Courts Martial, page 409 of the PDF:   Patronizing a prostitute:  (a) That the accused had sexual intercourse with another person not the accused's spouse  (b) That the accused compelled, induced, enticed, or procured such person to engage in an act of sexual intercourse in exchange for money or other compensation; and  (c) That this act was wrongful; and  (d) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.   Maximum punishment: DD, total forfeitures, reduction to E-1 and 1 year confinement.  Wrongfulness is also an element of drug use cases (under Article 112a) so ""it's legal where I did it"" is no more a defense to a prostitution charge than ""well I was in Colorado when I smoked the pot that made me pop positive"" is a defense to a 112a charge for wrongful use of marijuana.  I totally understand your point that we care a lot about human trafficking. If we got a report that some sailor visited a prostitute in Nevada without any other misconduct, I'd strongly encourage my lead trial counsel and our senior trial counsel that – even if on their face – all the elements are met that we don't have a true harm. Whether I'd win that fight is a different question but I'm hopeful.  It's a lot like an 18 or 19 year old sailor sexting their 17 year old partner. They can legally have sex but if the 17 year old sends a lascivious picture to the sailor, they have now received and possessed child pornography. Assuming the image wasn't shared, I would also strongly discourage charging that sailor even if all the elements are met (and they are, the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals had a case on this earlier this year (or maybe it was 2014)."

Collateral duties, specific billets, even volunteering for certain jobs can have you spending more time at the unit than the average midshipman.   None of these extra commitments get too much in the way of schoolwork, though, if that's something you're worried about.

With 2-3 divisions in each. This structure is entirely run by MIDN with the staff LTs serving as advisors. This structure mimics a ship well and provides a lot of knowledge how the chain of command works. For some negatives, RPI is a smaller school and tough to get into.

Some have a building right in the middle of campus, some are way out on the edge of campus.  I went to a school that I would've loved attending even if I didn't do NROTC.

I would hate to be the bearded one and fall off the sail, his harness isn't on right, but that's one way to lose ur nuts if you want too.  No cigars? Disappointing."
navy,3ct7pc,johnnuke,2,Sat Jul 11 04:22:31 2015 UTC,Not a 688I.  It's a Virginia Class boat.  The flying bridge assembly is different on a Virginia Class than on 688's and the Nav ID mast is different.
navy,3ct7pc,MadMando,2,Sat Jul 11 11:40:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly I haven't been underway on a Virginia but this still looks like a 688i to me. I know it's not a Seawolf or 688. I've seen the sail on a Virginia and I remember it having more bays, this doesn't have as many bays and and the nav id is centered as it should be on a 688i.

navy,3ct7ge,nashuanuke,2,Fri Jul 10 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"Here is an article that someone sent me yesterday about keeping mothers in the navy. Literally two of the 5 reasons are ""i just want to sit at home and have the military send me paychecks"".  My biggest problem is that civilians read this kind of bullshit and think that it's true or that it's anything but some pissed off O-2 bitching on a midwatch to make the military better.    I am glad there is a cultural blowback starting."
navy,3ct7ge,justatouchcrazy,8,Fri Jul 10 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"I do agree, but also unlike previous eras (not necessarily generations, just time) the civilian workforce is also changing dramatically.  Until relatively recently most workers stayed with the same company for many years/decades and there was an established promotion pathway, very similar to the military.  That was partially driven by pensions, which makes the military a bit of an ""old school"" employer because of that defined pension benefit.  So in a lot of ways previously the military and civilian worlds had at least a somewhat similar structure.  However that structure is starting to disappear in many fields.  A lot of workers are moving around to new companies or fields every few years, the path to promotions looks a lot different, and the workforce in general is becoming more flexible and unique for the individual.  Sure, no Fortune 500 company is letting you write your own work terms, but many employees are by the way they pick jobs.  Go for long hours and rapid promotions out of school, pick something a little slower paced when having children and settling down, and then make a last push before a gradual slow-down before retirement seems to becoming a more frequent option exercised by employees.  A lot of JOs are seeing their peers now moving into that slower period and are getting annoying that the military doesn't really offer that.  Which is fine, that's the virtue of the military and what we signed up for.  But it's a more striking difference that it's been in the past.  And I think this is what the Career Intermission Program, and other changes discussed recently, are trying to combat.  I don't think the military needs a complete HR reboot, but a few changes could make it a little bit closer to what the civilian world, at least in some fields, seems to be evolving towards.  Like it or not the bureaucracy will always be there, it's the nature of the beast and no amount of complaining will fix that.  But having just a few options and ways to get some limited control over your career/life instead of doing whatever Millington says could go a long way.  And I think that's what most of this boils down to.  Now a lot of employees have choices and control over their decisions and who they work for (to a larger extent than in the past) while we still have almost zero.  EDIT: I hope that didn't come off as a rant or complaining, just giving my opinion.  I'm obligated for more years than I care to think about, so I'm fairly distanced from this conversation and (perhaps due to my obligation) don't mind the Navy all that much and lean towards staying for a full career.  I do think a lot of these articles are all whining, although like the author I do see a lot of valid points being discussed as well."

If your personal preference of being with your child doesn't work with the Navy's mission then that's fine. That is a perfectly justifiable reason to get out. But pretending that every woman feels this way is dumb. Full time female actors, lawyers, doctors all work extremely long hours away from their children. It's the nature of the job.

I have never met a SWO mother who was senior to O-3, and most of those were on their way out. And every O-5 or above SWO that I have encountered has been an awful example for women, most of them have been divorced and very bitter.

The force structure matrix shows data, by paygrade, on what the Navy is authorized and what they actually have as far as manning goes.  SEA and SHORE means the Sailors in that column are on either sea duty or shore duty.  INV is inventory, i.e. what we actually have.  BA is billets authorized; this is what we are allowed to have.  So if you look at E5s on sea duty, you will see that we currently have 22 and we are authorized 34.  So we are at 64.7% manning for E5 Russian linguists on sea duty.  If you shift to the right and look at E5s on shore duty you will see that they have 56 while the authorized number of billets is only 35, so they are overmanned.  Make sense so far?"

Before the Cole attack, base security was mostly made up of TDY sea-intensive ratings (so they could have shore billets).    So back then, you could have a ticket issued to you by an HT, EN, MM, etc., who were doing what MAs do now.  There were very few MAs assigned to base security back then (or much of anywhere, really).    At my base, points were assessed.    I know, because I was the base traffic judge as an LN1.    As far as fines go, we could have issued them if we chose to.  But the base CO only authorized point deduction - mainly because an E6 was the base traffic judge.  If the traffic violation was egregious enough, it'd be handled by Mast.  Then the violator would be actually fined.  I know other bases, however, used the fine method.  But I'm guessing that was mostly at the larger bases.  I was just at a medium-sized NAS."

navy,3cnubv,BurningBushes2000,19,Thu Jul 9 13:52:53 2015 UTC,"Hmmm is that a veiled accusation? Haha. But seriously, I'll tell the story. I volunteered to go IA back in 2007 as a 3rd class. I got picked and assigned to Provincial Reconstruction Team Ghazni. The unit was made up of a conglomeration of navy and army from around the world. The CO was a Navy Commander, the XO was an Army Major the SEL was an Army First Sergeant and so on. A true mix of people. I was supposed to be a radio guy due to my background as a tech but the CO had different ideas. He gave the Chiefs and SFC's the option of picking specific people for specific jobs, hence me ending up working in Admin with a YNC. Learned a shitload about awards and evals and what not. In addition to that I ended up scoring the highest marksmanship scores of anyone in the PRT (army included) and got asked by the CO if I wanted to be his personnel security detachment or PSD. I was like sure why not. By accepting that job I ended up doing over 70 ground assault convoys and saw a lot of Afghanistan. We got into 3 separate TICs aka troops in contact. One was as you say a mortar attack, the funny thing about it was that it was on a moving convoy and they actually came close to our vehicles several times, so much so there were blast marks on one of the humvees. On another occasion we were just standing around shooting the shit with a tribal leader when we started getting fired on. Luckily no one was hit but I did return fire while the CO and driver dove back into the vehicle. The third was a rocket attack that once again didn't hurt anyone but rocked quite a few guys. The one event I wasn't involved in and I attribute to changing my life was this one: on the morning of May 20 the CO poked his head in admin and was like ""I don't think I'm gonna go to the clinic opening today so you can catch up on whatever YNC has you working on, I'll send some other people in my place. I said cool and went about my day. Long story short, the convoy hit an anti tank mine on their way out and 3 people died in the humvee I was supposed to be in including the LT that was sitting in the seat I would have been sitting in. I'm not religious but ever since then, I try to live my life as if it is worth it because I'm here and they aren't."

navy,3cmluv,bingo-babe,24,Thu Jul 9 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"Get good grades in college. You probably figured that, but it's probably the single most important thing.   You have to be an officer to be a pilot. To be an officer you have to do one of three officer training programs. You can do ROTC, Naval Academy, or OCS. I recommend ROTC, but you can PM me with any questions about that. They all have their pros and cons.   If and only if you can afford it, get your private pilot's license and your instrument rating while in college. It might or might not help with getting into flight school, but it will definitely help in primary. And it's in primary flight training where they assess you for fighter jets. If you don't fly until you get to the navy, that's fine but it's a bit more of a gamble.    family/friends think it would be a 'waste of my intelligence' to join the military instead of becoming a biologist or engineer, etc.    No offense but your family sounds like a bunch of naïve hippies. Don't listen to them. The military needs bright people.   --F-18 pilot"
navy,3cmluv,Superkeys,2,Thu Jul 9 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"Don't get a private pilot's license on your own.  The Navy will send you to fly in a Cessna or equivalent for about 20 hours prior to starting flight school.  They do this as a trial program since it is much cheaper for folks to learn they don't want to fly in the Cessna than it is in the T-6.  If you care to, you can spend your own money at that point and get the hours required to have a private pilot's license but it really isn't necessary.    I would also recommend you avoid aviation focused schools like Embry Riddle.  Some of the worst students we ever had in Primary were from ER and had over a thousand hours with CFII ratings.  Their problem was that they weren't willing to learn what we were trying to teach them.  You're better off showing up with an open mind and a willingness to learn than anything else."
navy,3cmluv,Rocketsponge,3,Thu Jul 9 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"Dude just trust me here.    The Navy will send you to fly in a Cessna or equivalent for about 20 hours prior to starting flight school.   Remember my caveat was if and only if she can afford it. You're giving bad advice. That program (IFS) only gets you 15 hours and it's all VFR flying, focusing mainly on the landing pattern. That doesn't buy you all that much in primary flight training, which comes next. If she gets her instrument rating, she'll have at least 50 hours (~100 is more realistic). That's a lot more experience going in. IFS doesn't teach anything about instrument flying. If she hasn't seen it before, she won't see it until halfway through the primary syllabus and she'll have a whole hell of a lot to learn really fast. It's definitely doable but there is a very distinct advantage to knowing what all that stuff is and having flown it before in civilian flying."
navy,3cmluv,Superkeys,2,Thu Jul 9 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"That program (IFS) only gets you 15 hours and it's all VFR flying, focusing mainly on the landing pattern. That doesn't buy you all that much in primary flight training, which comes next.   More importantly these days, skipping IFS helps avoid the crapshoot of dealing with non-Navy flight instructors where there's no standardization - let the Navy teach you how to fly and eliminate the variables"
navy,3cmluv,GTFErinyes,2,Fri Jul 10 02:20:23 2015 UTC,I dunno. I've got several thousand hours in T-34 and T-6 taking these kids from FAM-0 to selection over the course of about a decade. I think I'll stick with my advice.
navy,3cmluv,Rocketsponge,2,Fri Jul 10 04:10:26 2015 UTC,"So do you actually want to point out what's wrong with what I'm saying, or continue to tell me why you're so qualified to tell me I'm wrong?"
navy,3cmluv,Superkeys,2,Fri Jul 10 08:15:56 2015 UTC,"Happy to do both.  Here's why you're wrong:  The training program developed for Primary diverges from civilian aviation training significantly as it attempts to build qualitative skills in situational awareness and decision making, especially in emergency and malfunction situations.  Additionally training in Primary (and Advanced) seeks to instill the habit pattern of learning how to do specialized techniques and procedures that are not common in the civilian aviation world.  As an example, think back to your time flying non-depicted teardrops.  The ultimate purpose wasn't really so you could fly this type of approach (which I'm confident you've not flown once since Advanced).  The purpose was to teach a student how to learn and apply specific procedures.  This sort of habit pattern develops the skill set they need later on when they're learning how to do procedures from missile shoots to carrier landings.    The problem I and my colleagues have observed over time is that people who come to Primary with a high amount of civilian flight time have already developed habit and learning patterns from their time in GenAv.  As you likely know, it is very difficult to break a firmly established habit/learning pattern and get someone to adopt new ways of doing things they are familiar with.  You may have observed this from fellow Hornet pilots who moved between the various models (ie Hornet to Super Hornet) and had to break their old way of doing things.  Note I am not saying its impossible, just saying the ingraining of habits makes learning the Navy's way of doing things harder.    As an example, one student we failed out of the program had over 1,000 hours and CFII rating coming into Primary.  His airwork, landing pattern, and other basic aviation skills were all at a 4 or 5 level from day 1.  However, he was unwilling to learn his Emergency Procedures and normal Procedures to an acceptable level despite multiple chances.  Despite everything on paper seeming like this person should have been a good naval aviator, he was unable to talk through with precision things like how to do a loop, how to fly an approach per the FTI, or what to do during a compressor stall.    So in summary my advice to the young lady who started this thread is that its better to show up at Primary as a blank slate and unshaped block of clay, rather than with a sack of habit patterns she will have to break.    (PS - as a side note, I think kids who have the ability to do tailhook become apparent through the course of Primary based on their level of preparation and their natural ability to adapt to the environment.  I have seen kids who study 12 hours for a 1.5 hr flight and chairfly the whole event, only to struggle with the stick skills or situational awareness.  I've seen others who hop in the plane and are doing comms like they were old pros by the second flight.  I've also seen kids who struggled in Primary, but were late bloomers and rocked it in Advanced.  The NSS process it seems gets kids into tailhook who should go tailhook due to natural ability, and vice versa generally speaking.)"

Hell you even admit that that one guy didn't have a problem flying the navy way. He got 4's and 5's. Everyone I knew that got 80's and went jets had their instrument rating before the navy. While I was sitting there trying to remember where the fuck MDA is on the approach plate, they were able to focus almost completely on basic air work in the instrument environment. It may be better to be a blank slate if you have the raw talent, but what if you don't? Not everyone here is chuck Yeagar. It's possible to have civilian experience and not be a dick."

Ask yourself this though, would you be happy flying something that is NOT a jet? If the answer is no, then that is the risk you have to be willing to take.  Depending on the year, I recommend OCS. It's the only commissioning source that can guarantee your designator as a student pilot. Otherwise, you may end up driving ships, which I imagine is not what you're looking to do.

Hold some type of leadership position or have an interesting story to tell. These are not requirements, but all GREATLY increase your odds.  Do these things and you'll be a slam dunk candidate assuming they need pilots that year.  There are dozens of factors totally outside of your control though. Get all your ducks in a row to do what you can control, but have a fallback plan even if it's not the military.  Hit the genetic lottery and be able to pass a flight physical. This is the hard part you have no control over. A LOT of people who are outwardly ridiculously healthy have some weird underlying abnormality that bars them from flying.   I applied to fly helicopters. When I failed my flight physical, it was due to some weird inner ear thing that makes it hard to equalize pressure in extreme cases. I grew up in the mountains and large elevation changes/making ears pop was just a fact of life. Imagine my surprise when I got disqualified for that. The flight surgeon said that about 50% of the people that come through his doors have something come up that disqualifies them.  Also, look into the size requirements. If you are exceptionally large/small in any dimension, you are disqualified because you can't fit into the cockpit correctly."

navy,3ckys3,SuperNixon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:51:13 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh the classic conventional to aegis switch.  I can tell you from personal experience there are very few homegrown aegis chiefs, i think i have met two in my entire career and have been on 20 or so ships.  Mostly all of the AEGIS guys either get burned out from being overworked and the ones that don't go LDO because they can't stand to go back to a DDG as a chief. So you will be the norm as soon as you make chief.    The good, if you're a first class you will never have to touch a piece of gear. They understand that even though you went to C school, you have no idea what you're doing and will need at least 2 years OTJ experience to be a decent tech. So they're going to shuttle you into the watch organization and your focus is going to be force protection and higher end watches.  If you're a second class, you're pretty screwed because you're not going to know anything and junior E-4s are going to know more than you. Then after you're just becoming capable as a tech you will make E-6 and have to take on a leadership role without being able to do the weekly checks.  The bad: Welcome to hell friend. You're going to be taking care of a system that everyone from the captain to the admiral want to know the status of and deem themselves experts on. Have you ever troubleshot with the CO looking over your shoulder asking why that CCA vs the one to it's right? Well now you will get to.  Luckily they will expect more out of you because you are a higher rank than the E-4s, even though you have less experience.  Did you like saturdays to do things?  Yeah, about that.  You are going to have some of the longest hours in port, and there is nobody to help you via working party or anything else. You're going to be expected to do everything else, and then all of your maintenance on top of it.    My final piece of advice is if you get to choose your NEC, don't go spy. Go computer/ACNT because they have a roaming watch or FCS because they are the bastard children of the AEGIS world with 1/3rd of the work of the other work centers.  Also if you can go CG instead of DDG. Quality of life is SOOOO much better on a CG  Good luck out there,  I am sure i will see you in the fleet."

This whole year has been a huge fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants learning experience for me)  Probably 90% of what crosses my desk deals with a sailor's pay--either travel claims, BAS, or BAH/OHA.   It seriously sucks for OP...but it isn't money he was going to be seeing while overseas in Japan anyway as OHA is exactly his rent and no more. Since BAH is at command discretion for E5 and below on sea (pending available BEQ), he could, perhaps, route a special request chit, show proof of a valid lease stateside/proof that his HHG have been delivered there (probably he wasn't entitled to a HHG delivery, but who knows because homeport swaps are their own beast) and hope that his command will approve it.

You might need a POA for someone to sign the lease in your name while deployed--I'm not sure on the logistics of signing a (real) lease while deployed.   You're also hoping your CoC won't see through it as an attempt to get BAH when you have no need for it. If you aren't actually paying rent, why should they give you that money?   And besides--your HHG will be in storage, right, not delivered while you're not there to sign for it....  You can ask for the money. But I really doubt you're going to get it.

navy,3chtbg,gentlemangin,2,Wed Jul 8 12:54:43 2015 UTC,Each patrol underway we had inspections. Coners one patrol then nukes the next. A team of Senior/Master Chiefs and Commanders and maybe a Captain would come on board and review paperwork and do drills. We had to be in proper uniform with shaves and haircuts then. Usually takes about a week. And usually there's a practice inspection a couple weeks after we leave where they tell us we suck and would be BA if it was real. So then our CoC uses that to drill and test the fuck out of us for 1.5-2 months. On legit inspection we do just as well as before and get AA or E.

navy,3cil1s,weinerpretzel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:55:49 2015 UTC,You are not allowed to wear the uniform until frocked or actually advanced to the next paygrade. If you get to the date that your profile sheet says is your advancement date and you haven't been frocked you are now required to wear the rank that you have been advanced to. If you really are in the first increment you have 8 days to get your uniform squared away and give your TPU COC a heads up so some senior member that doesn't have access to all your personnel info doesn't flip out. MILPERSMAN 1420-060 deals with frocking but there doesn't seem to be one covering your specific situation as it is rare though I have seen it before. Just start wearing it and act accordingly.  TL;DR Check your profile sheet to be certain and if you do get paid 16 July tell the Sailor you muster with that you will be PO3 10100101011010100100 and to update his muster sheet accordingly.

Your mileage may vary.   Once you are actually advanced, you are authorized to wear your uniform however I doubt anyone but you is deeply interested in the exact date that this will happen.

Frocking is just tradition that the Navy uses to allow Sailors wear the uniform of the rank to which they have been selected prior to actually being advanced.

navy,3cbsj0,ADHD365,2,Tue Jul 7 00:53:04 2015 UTC,Its nothing like those giant grey things in the water. You might do on det for a week while all the crews in the squadron get the required quals for the next deployment. When you go on deployment you can expect average rotation cycle before you are back on home cycle for a year. As you can see I am being vague with the response to your question for obvious reasons.
navy,3cbsj0,StewTrue,2,Tue Jul 7 00:59:25 2015 UTC,"I just have a couple comments in addition to the already excellent response provided by ADHD365.  First off, I'm not an AWO - I'm an AT, so my perspective is that of a maintainer, but I have obviously worked very closely with the aircrew in my squadron and believe that I at least have some insight into what life would be like as an AWO for p3s/p8s.  I've done two P3 deployments, and AWOs seem to have the best gig in terms of the aircrew ratings.  AWFs, for instance, are in short supply and are frequently on duty as the ""duty FE"", which involves being available for engine turns, etc for a 24 hr period.  FEs are also generally responsible for ""putting the bird to bed"" - shutting down the APU, replacing engine covers, etc.  AWVs work with the trons when they're not flying, and always have to come back in to write up gripes, turn in comsec drives, and pass down all relevent info to the trons before leaving.  AWOs, on the other hand, mostly just operate the various avionics systems.  Now, it is true that they spend a lot of time studying, but this is true for all aircrew members.  There is a greater knowledge requirement for AWVs and AWFs.  An AWV, for instance, has to understand how to operate all avionics equipment, but also needs to memorize signal flows and troubleshooting steps.  AWFs have a great deal of understanding of the mechanics of the plane, including much of what an airframer or mech would be expected to know. Another thing to consider is quality of life during deployments.  AWOs, at least in my experience, always seemed to have the most free time on deployment.  This is not to say that they didn't work hard, because they obviously do, but it's just something I've noticed in the several years I've spent with them.  Keep in mind, however, that I'm not actually in the plane flying with these guys most of the time, so my perspective is limited to what I see on the ground."

navy,3ca4z5,gentlemangin,15,Mon Jul 6 16:05:07 2015 UTC,"In the beginning there was barely any security and certainly no forcepro.  This changed incrementally over time with some major leaps:  late 1980s:  Many bases were open posts.  Streets just ran right through them and there was nobody to ask who you were, much less challenge.  This is across the services, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Army.  Early 1990s:  Some gates began to go up, and a 24/7 presence was increasingly common.  This was mainly to keep people from going to the clubs on base over weekends, or to keep them out of the exchange as neither place really carded that hard.  It's worth pointing out that base E clubs were the shit back in the day.  Cheap booze, no age limit with a green card (this was pre-CAC and IDs were laminated and green), and it was not uncommon to see strippers (M and F) at base clubs.  Mid 1990s - Khobar Tower Bombing changed a LOT of shit.  Overseas installation gor locked down in a quick hurry,  followed more lethargically by stateside installations.  Curfew, pillboxes, you name it.  It got really old really fast, and things were probably about to chill a hair until...  Late 1990s:  the Embassy bombings, which cranked forcepro right into a higher gear that it's been in ever since.  About this time, I think FP conditions came out.  Curfews got tighter as well.  These fancy new CAC cards began to appear initially about this time IIRC.  In Manama specifically, a USMC FAST team started what would turn out to be a nearly 2 year deployment, for instance.    *to answer your specific questions: *   I imagine absolute mayhem, with anyone and anything being able to come and go as they please onboard ships and bases alike,   Bases, yes.  Ships, not really.  That said a standard in port watch was usually one schmuck third class with a 1911 at the brow and not much else.  Often in SDBs.   with a reactionary response to any issues that may have risen, versus the preventative measures we see today.   Nailed that one.   Who manned the gates?    Usually some random soul from X-Div, 10, or whatever org handled that on any given base.  The specific people often came from a manning tax on the various units and tenant commands on a base.  You'd a get a few hours-ling ""class"" stand a few UI watches and then you were off and running.   How was base access controlled?    At first in my time very little, later increasingly so.  When I say very little I mean in a lot of places there was literally not a gate to man and nobody there.     What training did the MAs/ ASF/ NSF have before?    I was on ASF when I was a PO3, training consisted of range quals and some very disorganized crap that the local collateral duty MAC (who was not an MA) slapped together.  I did it for an eval bullet and because I got a range card and could go shoot there on the weekends.  I never actually did any ASF stuff.   What did force protection consist of prior to these events?   Like I alluded to above, the concept of Force Protection didn't exist until around late 90s.  Or maybe it did, but at the large base I was stationed at, and all of the units I deployed to at the time (and there were many) it was never mentioned."
navy,3ca4z5,justarandomshooter,11,Mon Jul 6 13:23:27 2015 UTC,"Base clubs were awesome in the early 90's.  If you couldn't get laid at the club, you didn't deserve to.  It was that simple.  There were fleet sailors, Marines, A-school students, plus-one's, and assorted random civilians.  All drunk.  Definitely the ""target-rich environment"" coined by Top Gun.  But as far as base security, if I forgot my ID in my barracks (or at home), I could usually flash a dollar bill really quickly when I went through the gate with my car.  They were the same shade of green, and who looked that closely?"

If I ever forgot or lost my ID, I could also use my Navy American Express card at night, too.    And for all the little chitlens who go to mast for losing a CAC, losing an ID wasn't a big deal either.  It might have required a special request chit to get replaced, but then again it might have not.  Hard to remember, we were all too busy having a few beers at lunch with the Chief.  No more than three though, we're professionals..."

I don't remember who challenged me, but there were chicks at the table, so I drank a pitcher of beer.  Went straight to the head to puke, and puked cold, foamy beer.  It didn't even have time to lose carbonation, or get to body temperature.  Promptly ordered another pitcher on someone's tab for ""winning"".  To all who still aren't picturing what base clubs were like ... there used to be a line to get ON to base, to get in line for the club.  Damn, I miss NTC San Dawg sometimes."
navy,3ca4z5,blue_27,4,Mon Jul 6 16:23:08 2015 UTC,"there used to be a line to get ON to base   I forgot about that!  There used to be a lot of future Exes just outside the gate back in the day.  At my A School there were several duty vans, but the ones they made sure to use on the weekends were vinyl lined.  The reason being that they were easy to hose puke out of in the mornings.  The reason the got barfed in was the command ran a shuttle service to the club because people were so shithoused they got lost on the way back, or just got sleepy and crashed on the way.  Again, this was at my A SCHOOL."
navy,3ca4z5,justarandomshooter,9,Mon Jul 6 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"Marines were our security for most Naval Bases, Carriers had Marine detachments for security. On my carrier we had a few MAs who were augmented with TAD folks, the MAs basically kept the system running and handled the XOI/Mast/ and they ran the brig.    The Navy as a whole had a lax security posture and I remember only the GM/AOs were the only who got armed for watch. MAs still do all the archaic duties on small boys."
navy,3ca4z5,club41,7,Mon Jul 6 09:58:12 2015 UTC,"Former Legalman here.  I got out before 9/11.  MA's back then were only E5 and up.  They were converted from other ratings through a fairly rigorous selection process.    Shore installation security was mostly handled by Marines until the (I think) the early 90s, when it was handed over to DoD Civilians for larger bases.  I don't recall whether they were DoD police, or just some other security-related job series.  That was at NAVSTA Norfolk.    At smaller bases - at least at the NAS I was stationed at - there was a Marine Cadre (I think one E-6, if I remember correctly) who was augmented by a bunch of other sea-intensive ratings, such as MM, EN, HT, etc.  These guys all had to go to school at Lackland before they reported as base security. I believe this was nominally done to provide some shore billets for the sea duty-heavy ratings.   They all functioned pretty much like standard security, conducting perimeter patrols, traffic patrol, investigated petty crimes (the NIS Resident Agent handled the bigger crimes), wrote ICR's, that sort of thing.  As an LN it kinda sucked sometimes, because I had to review all the ICRs the morning after they were written.  Let's just say that the quality of writing varied greatly from rating to rating.   Sneaking on base was still pretty tough, what with 24-hour perimeter patrols and barbed-wire topped hurricane fences.  Plus, I don't recall a single instance of unauthorized breach of a shore base.    This, however, was just the way it was at my medium-sized NAS.  It could have been different at other shore installations  On ships, a big part of MA's responsibilities was good order and discipline.  Roll your sleeves down, straighten your cover, that kind of crap.  But they did investigate petty crimes, handle official ceremonies (like organizing Mast), etc.  On small boys (cruisers, destroyers, frigates), there was usually one senior MA (MAC or MACS) who was augmented by TAD ratings from the ship's divisions.  On the cruiser I was on, I think it was five or six TAD Master-at-Arms...just enough to fill out a duty watch bill.  The TAD Master-at-Arms assisted the senior MA in conducting Mast, managing restricted men, urinalysis, and a lot of other stuff.  The MA Office also issued linen and (I think) rack assignments - but I don't remember for sure.  They also handled deck/passageway closures for hazmat transfers.  MA's were generally unarmed for most of their shipboard duties, except brig running.  Shipboard watches (i.e., the quarterdeck, roving patrols, etc.) were the only ones who were armed outside of a security alert.    I know, because I did an 18 month tour as a TAD MA before I converted to LN.     On larger boats, such as the Sub Tender I was on, there were three or four MAs - a couple of MA1s and an MACS - who were augmented by about seven or eight TAD Master-at-Arms.  They pretty much did the same thing, except they also managed the shipboard brig.    There was no such thing as an MASR, MASA, MASN or MA3 back then.    Lemme see...kinda rambled on here.  Not sure if I answered all your questions."
navy,3ca4z5,Bosworth2,5,Mon Jul 6 13:26:32 2015 UTC,"Back in 88-92, the smaller bases were just manned by a couple of sailors. I pulled watch once during the time I was at Correy Station in Pensacola and I can't even remember if they issued us a pistol. Probably not.  The biggest issue we had to deal with was some Dependapotamus losing her shit if we didn't salute their car while they were on their way to the Navy Commissary to buy twenty bags of Doritos.  ""My husband is a LTJG and you have to salute me!!"" Herp derp.  Bigger bases like Norfolk had civilian guards IIRC."

No concrete barriers to drive around.   As soon as it happened the gates had barriers, dogs, the mirrors to look under your car. They opened the hood and trunk on all the cars. There were at least 5 people looking over your car at once. This went on for a while until things calmed down.   The training squadrons down there went into overdrive, they were scheduling something like 5,000 flight hours a week."
navy,3ca4z5,DonnerPartyPicnic,5,Mon Jul 6 10:21:38 2015 UTC,MA's are still augmented at gates. I've stood ECP and main gate with tons of other rates. Just so long as we had at least one MA with us it was okay.
navy,3ca4z5,Twisky,3,Mon Jul 6 12:19:59 2015 UTC,"Gate duty was a watch anyone could get pulled for .  E1's out there, no weapons stateside with ma's mustering the watch (ma's not remaining at the gate,  but ""roving""), or they were civilians with weapons. When 911 happened, asf  augmented the watch, and this was a voluntary collateral duty, where weapons were issued.  Had one of those knuckleheaded cta's discharge a weapon in my shop,  told them they weren't allowed inside my spaces anymore.  Was good times."

Easier than going all the way home; there were showers in the locker room and I had extra clean uniforms in my locker.  I get it.

navy,3cbtbu,MadMando,6,Mon Jul 6 20:01:25 2015 UTC,"First, as a retired boat sailor, I can say that we generally sleep when we can because shit always comes up and never know when your next rack time will come. Now, for submarines I can tell you that  nowadays they are not allowed to bring most cell phones, iPads or such down the the boat. Also, since they just returned from deployment that means a good half of the crew is on leave so that could certainly mean that he is in a small duty rotation and maybe even port and starboard so basically he could have duty every other day or every third day, for some especially depending on where they live or such it could just be easier for them to stay on the boat till their leave starts. Now if you really need to get a hold of them, you can call the submarine, they have several land lines when in port. If you don't have their number, go online and look up whatever base he's stationed on and they should have a list of commands with phone numbers.  It is a little strange for a guy wanting to spend more time on the boat he just spent many months on but what he says is totally plausible.   Please excuse spelling and grammar errors, using my cell. :)"
navy,3cbtbu,forzion_no_mouse,4,Mon Jul 6 20:25:44 2015 UTC,well if he is on the sub he probably isn't allowed to have his phone with him.
navy,3cbtbu,heyimawesome,5,Mon Jul 6 23:09:04 2015 UTC,Wait. He's a nuke and he gets sleep?
navy,3cbtbu,ANHEROseven,3,Tue Jul 7 00:35:08 2015 UTC,"If he's within 3 days of returning from deployment and didn't take leave in the first half, then he could be involved in shutting down the reactor. I'm only a sonar tech so I dont have much knowlege about what all goes on in nuke land but I do know that when you're not doing work you're either on the pier with a phone or you're in the rack. There's not much sleep after you get back for a few reasons. More oxygen and sunlight are the two main reasons, add in getting to talk to family and browse the internet. you'll find yourself up for 2-3 days straight.  Another reason could be that he is in trouble. Restriction on the boat means that he can't play on his phone, or call from the boat unless given permission."
navy,3cbtbu,iamgoogly,3,Mon Jul 6 22:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is unhealthy for someone to live at work, but it can be pretty common on a Submarine. Here are my thoughts that even after all this time my family still doesn't seem to understand (they complain about it with regular frequency, way more than I do and I actually have to live though it)  1) You cannot bring your cell phone on a boat. Big big big no-no.  2) If in 3 section duty (pretty common in my experience) you can expect them to be on the boat for about 40 hours every 3 days assuming they are working merely 8 hour days.  3) Shift work further complicates this. For instance, 12 hour shift work, which usually turns into 13-14 hours because of turnovers, after commuting can easily turn into weeks of getting home with just enough time to eat and pass out before getting up to come back to work. This reason right here is why people sometimes decide to just sleep on the boat when they don't have to. We did the math for my current boat and realized that I've spent about 25% of the past 3 years in 12 hour shifts. So it's common enough.   Just trust him when he says he is busy. He doesn't need that guilt laid on him from people who have it easier."

It's hard to truly volunteer when you have no idea what you're volunteering for.  Also, depending on the demand, certain Midshipmen get ""encouraged"" to volunteer for subs.  If the submarine force needs more bodies and there are no volunteers they'll ramp up pressure on the holdouts until they make the numbers.

Also, a section to store notes ...and make each note password lockable as a feature so I could store notes about my sailors, like SN Timmy was late again to quarters--ask lpo what's going on, WSC's uniform was really squared away, help HTC format the paperwork to recommend HT2 to DAPA for SARP screening because this is the 6th time he's shown late and up reeking of alcohol and asking around for cash because ""he spent it all in Roppongi"" in the last two weeks(see previous notes!!), etc."" --that would be nice.   Additionally a flash card feature for working on all the new quals the junior officers have to get might be helpful. It would have been helpful when working on my warfare pins, anyway.

If you could make each file more easily searchable or add a feature to ""add a stickie note"" to the pages would be nice....an easily searchable JTR would be spectacular. 50% of pay issues I see at my command are due to misunderstanding entitlements as written in the JTR.

Unless things have changed greatly, Day 1, Event 1 is the PT test.  If you fail you will most likely be on the first bus home.  Do not do this.  Most people do not fail the run portion: it is usually the push ups and pull ups.  They grade them hard: you have to touch the ground with your chest and lock out the arms.  If you fail to do this the push up doesn't count.  The pull ups have to be done with the lower body still: no kipping.  The standards are here.  As you can see, the times for the run and the swim aren't that hard, you just have to be in reasonable shape.  Also, if you do the run in 9:00 or 12:29 it doesn't really matter for diver: it is a pass/fail evolution.  Just make sure that you are ready to pass the test on day 1."

If you want to prove that you are a PT god, do so at the final PT test at the end.    Get in shape, and take a practice test a couple of time so you are confident that you will pass.  When you take the test on the first day take it easy on the swim, and do enough sit ups, push ups, and pull ups to pass plus a few.

navy,3card8,ProfShea,5,Mon Jul 6 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"Definitely second the suggestion for r/militarySO. Very supportive community there.   It's like any other relationship with the exception that there are more demands on their time. They can't just not fulfill their military duty--being late to work or not showing up, missing duty, not going when they get an assignment (JAG is pretty removed from the real Navy though). I think a lot of MILSOs find that the hardest to understand. That there are going to be missed events like birthdays and anniversaries and there's absolutely nothing to be done about it.    Another thing, a majority of MILSOs wrap themselves in their SO as an identity. Please don't do that. ""My husband is a chief,"" ""He putting on Commander so we can't hang out because your sailor is only an Ensign,"" etc. To everyone who is active duty that is really obnoxious and an insult (they went through boot camp or the academy or ROTC, not their spouse, and ""fraternization"" isn't even a thing for the spouses but they pretend it is) and it makes the MILSO seem really insecure. You will run into other women (because the men MILSOs I know don't seem to care) who get really, REALLY wrapped around the axel about their sailor's rank/job title/etc and will be condescending to you.  My observation is most of those spouses don't have anything else they can claim ownership of (education, job etc). It is really hard to be around a community that values titles and not have one yourself. TLDR don't hang out with other MILSOs who are only concerned with their sailor's rank/job and your sailor's rank/job.   Is there anything specific you wanted to know?"

navy,3c7f5f,yomandenver,2,Sun Jul 5 18:26:27 2015 UTC,If they do end up leaving this time will it affect COLA due to the Drachma likely being much weaker? And any other factors like that.
navy,3c7f5f,TheBeneGesseritWitch,4,Sun Jul 5 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"COLA will go down if the drachma's buying power goes down in relation to the U.S. dollar. When our Yen rate was 60¥ to $1, our cola was high. Now it's doubled, 120¥ to $1, and our COLA is lower.   So the military says ""a meal in town should cost you $10."" And you get paid $10. But in your duty station's country, they have a strong currency--and $10 can only buy $5 worth of food. The navy compensates you for this and gives you an extra $10, so you can buy a whole meal.   Now say the opposite--their currency is terribly weak. You can buy a whole meal in town for $2.  This means you can buy 5 meals for $10. You will not get any extra money.    So if the drachma goes down compared to the dollar, you can expect COLA to drop too. This is because, for a while anyway, your paycheck will have you living like a king on the economy.   This is all based on the premise that the drachma will be weak (at first). I don't really know if that's how it will work--iirc, it did when the Euro got started, thre was a bit of a slump in currency value on the international market)"

navy,3c3a9e,TheMightyMatador,15,Sat Jul 4 10:58:34 2015 UTC,"Apologies in advance- this is on mobile.  I want to clear up some common misconceptions about medical in general and then specifically knee ""pain"".   First: medical does want to see you.  It's best to go sooner, rather than late, especially for acute issues.  Chronic issues are a whole can of worms.  ""Why didn't you come in sooner? If you weren't 100%, you could endanger yourself or someone else"", et cetera.  Second: the knee capsule as a whole has s lot of moving parts.  Even for trained corpsman, a knee exam takes time,both to learn and to perform.  As a whole you have:  Patella. This is your knee cap.  It doesn't float but is held in place by the patellar tendon, which inserts into the 4 quadriceps muscles.  If any one if the four are weaker than the others, it'll pull the patella off track and cause pain.  You usually have pain while seated for long periods.  That's PFS.  If it's point tenderness just above, below or around the patella, that can be patellar tendinitis. Cause annoying pain.  Seen in under use (not strengthening the quad enough OR correctly) or over use (going from 0 running to full blast)  ACL/PCL:  these are the anterior and posterior cruciate (crossing) ligaments. They keep your tib/fib and below from sliding back or forward out of place.  A tear in any of these will show step off, be excruciatingly painful.  Usually seen in sports related injuries or car accidents.  MCL/LCL: the medial and lateral (left and right depending) collateral ligaments keep your tib/fib and below from sliding off to the side out of place. Moderate to severe pain.  Usually seen with direct force injuries to the side of the knee or lower leg.  Meniscus: these are the shock absorbers.  They cushion the tib/fib from bagging all the time into the bottom of the femur.  Tears or nicks in these, you have two in each knee, cause severe pain, locking or jamming, and dysfunction.  These can heal on their own or need surgery.  Usually occur in ""pivot"" injuries or sports injuries.   Bursa these are sacs of synovial fluid that lubricate the joint capsule.  Injuries to these cause inflammation or drainage.  Can be painful, but not terribly., caused by over use.    Then you have the bodies natural reaction to injuries- swelling.  By pushing fluid to an injury, the body can cushion again further injuries.  Problem is, is that fluid pushes against nervesm,..causing pain.   Ok- so why the lengthy anatomy lesson?  Because I want to convey that there's a LOT that can go wrong with a knee.  When i perform a knee exam, I run two tests on each of the above to see if there's any tear/dysfunction/ injury.  There's no one test for everything.  Not every injury will be picked up the first time.  Or maybe even the second.  I'm not going to needlessly irradiate you (plain film X-ray) without significant cause-  because plain film X-rays only show bone- not the ligaments or meniscus or other soft tissue.  MRIs are fantastic to see if you have a tear.  But it's an exponential dose of radiation, and most MTFs have one, maybe two, for the entire service population.  You MIGHT get one in 3-weeks. MRIs are NEVER ever ASAP/STAT orders.    Give your MO or IDC time to figure out what's going on.  Be cognizant that a lot of disease processes act similar, so while you may have patellar tendinitis (hypothetically), you may in fact have PFS, or bursitis.   Motrin works. Stop. I know what you are going to say. It works.  It's not necessarily a pain reliever, but an anti-inflammatory.  It takes time to build up enough of the pain reliving level in your body for what's called a therapeutic dose.  Motrin, naproxen, and Mobic, are all the same TYPE of drug, so they all work generally the same way, but on different things.  You NEED to be consistent with it.  Motrin is three times a day, not two, or as needed, for musculoskeletal injuries.  You NEED to take it with meals or it can cause stomach lining discomfort (and after long term use, ulcers).  If you miss a dose, that therapy level decreases, your pain doesn't get better, and you think BAS or Sickbay is full of shit.  You have to be strict in yourself when prescribed NSAIDs, or they don't do you any good.  I hope that helps.   -HM1"

navy,3c3a9e,club41,2,Sat Jul 4 16:03:52 2015 UTC,It's best to have established a continuity of symptomatology when you approach the VA with a claim.

Told me I could deal with it or get out.   I transferred duty stations about 18 months later,  and squawked to medical there,  who referred me out to an ortho. Got my MRI back,  and said ""torn meniscus"". He showed me pics from the surgery... My knee looked like the fuzzy side of velcro inside. He said he had to take out about 60% of the cartilage.  He also asked me when I tore my ACL. When I looked at him quizzically,  he said I showed evidence of a healed partial tear that I didn't even know happened!   15 years later,  I still can't run.  It still locks up on me occasionally. Doc tells me I probably have to have it replaced by 55 (about another decade).  Bottom line is, if you're having knee problems,  get them looked at ASAP,  and don't shut up until they're right."

That being said, if you enlist, you will go to a new school called the Defense Information School (DINFOS) and you will learn how to write, produce videos, use the Adobe suite of products and take news-style pictures to Navy specifications.  They say the training is equivalent to an associate's degree, or two years of education in six months.  It is strangely strenuous and a good amount of people fail out.  My class began with 23 people and graduated with 13 plus one recycled student.  Once you graduate, the job grants the possibility of being among the greatest in the Navy.  Wherever you get sent, they will probably put you right in the middle of the action immediately.  Well, after command indoc.

navy,3c0sd7,WIlf_Brim,2,Fri Jul 3 19:01:31 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters the only thing close to MC as an Officer designator is a PAO."
navy,3c0sd7,bc87m,8,Fri Jul 3 18:54:13 2015 UTC,Which is an incredible difficult designator to get. Here is some information to get you started.  https://www.navycs.com/officer/publicaffairs.html
navy,3c0sd7,haze_gray,2,Fri Jul 3 19:40:29 2015 UTC,I though most PAOs were lateral transfers from another designator.  Back in the day (when we had them) a bunch came from the General Unrestricted Line (100x).
navy,3c0sd7,looktowindward,2,Fri Jul 3 23:38:01 2015 UTC,"I think they also take civies based on this link:  http://www.npc.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/Detailing/rlstaffcorps/public_affairs/Pages/APPLYFOROCS.aspx  As you can see, 3 slots for FY16 highlights just how competitive these slots are. I think VP Biden's son picked up a slot in FY14, when there were only four available, and about a year later he failed a drug test and was discharged. I only bring that up because it's ridiculous that it happened when the field is so difficult to get into."
navy,3c0sd7,WIlf_Brim,2,Fri Jul 3 23:57:43 2015 UTC,"They are also MCs who get picked up to be an officer.   Coming in as a PAO is incredibly difficult because there is so much competition, from all over, and there's only one or two spots per year."

navy,3c0sd7,smokinglamp_throw,2,Sun Jul 5 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"You could be an officer, but in all honesty, they only take a very few PAOs a year, and you wouldn't even be doing much MC work anyway. I would enlist as an MC - the pay is less but you'll actually get to do the job you signed up for (unless your ship is in the yards, of course). There are a wide variety of places you could go - carriers, LHDs, public affairs offices, AFN detachments overseas, etc; but for your first assignment you're likely to go to a ship or to AFN.   If you enlist, you'll go to boot camp and spend 6 months at DINFOS learning a lot of what you learned in college, but the ""Navy Way"" of doing it.   The best thing I can tell you is to enlist as an MC if you're dead set on doing photo/video/etc. Public Affairs Officers don't touch any of that."
navy,3c0sd7,stuckinthepow,2,Fri Jul 3 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"Talk with a recruiter.  There is no MC equivalent for officers.  The nearest officer community is PAO, but the work is totally different and they take mostly (exclusively?) redisignated officers who have already done a tour or two in the fleet.  It's a very small community and I have never heard of a PAO coming directly from the civilian world.  You need to enlist as an MC if you want to do the kind of work you trained for in school.  What was your GPA?  It's very rare to see officers of any flavor who had less than a 3.0.  Your health and criminal record also matter.  Everybody in the military does ""boot camp"" or an equivalent.  That should be the least of your concerns, though.  That's the easy part."
navy,3c0sd7,Thameus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:27:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the advice. I realize I sound like an idiot, but I'm just starting to research what the military has to offer. My GPA was 3.3, but that was mostly due to one science class because I had 4.0 semesters for my last 3. I took wayyyy more science and math than the average art student because I was going to do nursing. It just dragged me down in the end."
navy,3c0sd7,fozzit,2,Fri Jul 3 21:52:28 2015 UTC,"No worries.  We all had to start somewhere.  Speak with a recruiter. From where I stand it seems like you have a choice of either enlisting as an MC or applying to join an officer community that has nothing to do with what you studied.  Chances are good for the first and the second is more of a long shot (and will take a long time).  Neither is ""better"" or ""worse"" - just different.  Decide what's more important to you.  3.3 isn't a terrible GPA, but it's not great and the navy won't see your major as a rigorous one (they generally prefer STEM majors from name-brand schools).  You're competing with a lot of people for any officer spot, so the rest of your packet will have to be on point if you want a chance at an officer program."

navy,3c0u3u,apatheticnihilist,5,Fri Jul 3 20:58:52 2015 UTC,The funeral director arranges all those accomodations. Source: was tad to military funeral honors and our poc was a regional coordinator who worked with all the funeral homes/directors.

I've performed funeral honors in church cemeteries, veteran's cemeteries, private property, you name it.  If you're close enough to a Navy presence, the Navy honor guard will come to the graveside ceremony and perform a military ceremony that includes removing the flag from the casket, folding it in a ceremonial manner, playing ""Taps"" on the bugle, and presenting the flag in a ceremonial manner to whoever has been designated to receive it - usually a surviving spouse, son, or daughter.  It is a solemn and moving ceremony and, having served honorably, he is entitled to receive it upon burial.  As long as you can show them the DD214, the funeral home should be able to arrange the details."

navy,3c0u3u,DaveSenior72,4,Sat Jul 4 17:56:04 2015 UTC,"Military honors will be performed anywhere. Part of my shore command's responsibilities is to render funeral honors at veterans' funerals. It's a fairly quick ceremony we do, generally towards the very beginning of the service, that consists of us escorting the remains to the burial site from the hearse, or, if cremains and already placed on a pedestal, marching ceremoniously to the head and foot side and standing at attention until we do the ceremony. That consists of a playing of Taps by bugle, folding the flag, and presenting it to the designated next of kin (if cremains and pre-folded, we will unfold and refold the flag).   Any funeral director should know whom to contact to arrange funeral honors, if requested. I've done a dozen or so funerals and it's a really moving experience every time. If you and the family request it, it will be done."

I've been reading a book recently about Naval action around Guadalcanal and its absolutely amazes me what that generation endured.

navy,3c10cg,Castleheart,21,Fri Jul 3 19:48:59 2015 UTC,"Sir or ma'am is foolproof.   Only go with mister with officers you know well. I called my DIVO mister (last name) when we were in the shop. But outside the shop, it was sir."
navy,3c10cg,haze_gray,7,Fri Jul 3 20:02:37 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you. What I'm wondering is, in which circumstance does using ""mister"" or ""miss"" tend not to bat any eyes? O-4 within your chain of command (as opposed to outside)? Is it more acceptable for Chiefs and Warrants to use rather than junior sailors?    I'm just trying to draw a parallel here. In the AF, addressing any officer by ""mister"" or ""miss"" would be perceived by most people as a form of disrespect, regardless of chain or rank of the junior member. (Much like how addressing an enlisted member as ""Sir"" or ""Ma'am"" warrants a pee-pee smacking in any other branch than the AF.)  The only people who are addressed this way are civil servants and such."
navy,3c10cg,looktowindward,8,Fri Jul 3 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"You must never call a Chief Petty Officer, ""mister"". That is absolutely disrespectful. Also, they'll murder you.  It is appropriate to call Warrant Officers, O1 to O3, Midshipmen, and Officer Candidates as ""Mr"". It is absolutely appropriate at all times, from a military POV.  This is a very old tradition in the Navy and is not seen as being disrespectful.   ""Sir"", ""Rank <name>"", ""Rank <without name>"" or ""Mr. <name>, are all fine, but the ""Rank <name>"" approach is the typical way that senior enlisted chew out junior officers, so you've got to watch out for that:  CPO Jones: ""Ensign Smith, I need to have a word with you""  ENS Smith: ""oh, sorry Chief, I shouldn't have sent the division home without talking with you...""  ""Rank <without name"" such as ""Hey, LT"" is something you only do with folks you are tight with. Sometimes you also refer to officers by position ""Good Morning Weps"" for the Weapons Officer, for example. Again, this is a sign of familiarity so you don't do this everywhere.  Its awesome when your guys call you ""LT"" and you know you have fucked something up pretty bad when its back to ""sir"" or ""Mister looktowindward"" in the shop."

For Ensigns, LTjg I have never been corrected using Sir, Mr or rank AND name. For LT's I usually just refer to them as L-T, ""good morning LT"".

Akbar was the court-martial of a United States Army soldier for a premeditated attack in the early morning hours of March 23, 2003, at Camp Pennsylvania, Kuwait, during the start of the United States invasion of Iraq.  Former Sergeant Hasan Karim Akbar (born Mark Fidel Kools on April 21, 1971) threw four hand grenades into three tents in which other members of the 101st Airborne Division were sleeping, and fired his rifle at fellow soldiers in the ensuing chaos. Army Captain Christopher S. Seifert was fatally shot in the back, and Air Force Major Gregory L. Stone was killed by a grenade. Fourteen other soldiers were wounded by Akbar, mostly from grenade shrapnel.  At trial, Akbar's military defense attorneys contended that Akbar had psychiatric problems, including paranoia, irrational behavior, insomnia, and other sleep disorders. In April 2005, he was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders of Seifert and Stone.  The Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the sentence on July 13, 2012. A subsequent appeal is now pending before the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

I coordinate run schedules for power plants and keep the transmission lines from burning down in a large part of the country. Mostly staring at computer screens / reddit. Actual work a shift: maybe an hour? Six figures.  An ET I knew on the boat works for a drink bottling plant. When a machine goes down there, the company can lose hundreds of thousands of dollars, but the fixes are simple circuit card swaps. When the phone rings in his office, he takes a golf cart to the machine, swaps out a card, and goes back to whatever it was he was doing. Actual work: 20 minutes a day if something breaks. Six figures.  An ELT I knew works for a large craft brewery, doing similar chemical analysis to what he did on the boat, or that's how he describes it. Awesome job, also gets paid in real money and beer.  An MM I knew works on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Something like two weeks on/two weeks off.

Almost every nuke I've talked to so far has recommended that you re-enlist at least once and get qualified as a nuke supervisor and get experience in that role before trying to transition civilian, especially if you wanted to go into the civilian nuclear industry.

Another duty day away from my husband and kid? another duty station unaccompanied in a different country?--staying in until 20 sounds like a far superior deal to me than working until I'm ~70.

A pension for a Master Chief is 3k a month before taxes. Which is good but add in taxes, FICA, social security, and it's far less. I just don't get how you could live off that little and still save for retirement in your Roth and Mutual funds.   Unless you're cashing out a retirement fund earlier?  I'm really curious."
navy,3bseem,TheBeneGesseritWitch,4,Thu Jul 2 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"Well, we live very frugally. I cloth diaper, for crying out loud.  We save a lot, really--a lot. Like half our total paycheck each. I think total we are living on one E4's salary.   Also, we will be buying our house (no mortgage, with cash) when we leave Japan. That's a considerable amount of money freed up that would normally be deducted out of a fixed income.   Between our interest returns on our (projected) IRA totals, plus navy pension, we won't have to work unless we want to do so.   Not a lifestyle for everyone. But it works for us. And if I can live off half an E6 pay check now, I should be good to go living off an O3 pension (if I ever get picked up for LDO....).   Some might argue that living on such a restricted budget isn't ""really living,"" but I still have nice toys, I drive a nice car.....I just spent a little longer saving my ""fun money"" from my budget to get them, or bought them second hand or on sale. And I sacrificed unnecessary stuff (coach purses, the newest iPhone) to get what I really wanted.   All my needs are met, and most of my wants, too. Except time off, I want more of that.

navy,3brhi4,BubbleHead87,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:26:01 2015 UTC,It's been great. I wore glasses since I was in 3rd grade. The greatest feeling ever was Not having to reach for my glasses to check the time for the very first time. It was a fairly simple process. They checked my eyes. Gave me the talk about the possible side effects and things of that nature. I believe a few days before the actual surgery I had to get a tiny hole lazered into my eyeball. Something about relieving the stress. Day of surgery I showed changed into those hospital gown. They plopped me on a gurney and wheeled me into the room. Put some clamps on my eyes so I couldn't close them. Doc did his thing while a nurse was squirting water into my eyes every so often. The survey itself didn't hurt. It was just a very very akward feeling. Your eyes are dilated and they shine those big lights into your eyes. Because of the clamps you get close them which makes it very comfortable. I was in and out of the surgery maybe 30 minutes. The only side effect I end up having is what I think they call is night blindness. At night times the halos you see around lights seems to be much more larger covering a lot of my field of vision. It doesn't effect my driving at night. I just have to shift my gaze away from the light for a quick sec till I pass it. Now driving through the boonies where it's pitch black really screws with me when a car is coming on the opposite side.

navy,3bqs9u,g33k1977,5,Wed Jul 1 11:56:10 2015 UTC,"I remember taking a tour of one of the Iowa class BB's, and remember seeing the side of one of the turrets (not sure if it was one of the Mark 7's or the Mark 12's) where apparently a 5 inch shell had impacted it. There was just an ugly blemish in the armor... that was it.  So calling off sweepers for something like an exocet sounds somewhat feasible to me."
navy,3bqs9u,Wells1632,-3,Wed Jul 1 14:05:09 2015 UTC,So calling off sweepers for something like an exocet sounds somewhat feasible to me.   Not even close.  Ask the guys who were on the USS Stark.
navy,3bqs9u,Mr_Weebles,11,Wed Jul 1 15:15:55 2015 UTC,The Stark was a Frigate. Comparing a Frigate to a Battleship is like comparing a paper bag to a Bullet Proof Vest.
navy,3bqs9u,tadpole256,6,Wed Jul 1 17:12:59 2015 UTC,"BB were made to take a shit ton of damage and keep fighting. Ships like the Stark werent. If the same missile hit the USS IOWA, it wouldnt have even affected it."
navy,3bqs9u,somerandomguy1232,2,Wed Jul 1 16:56:26 2015 UTC,"If the same missile hit the USS IOWA, it wouldnt have even affected it.   An Exocet has a 364 pound warhead delivered at around 700 MPH. It could damage a battleship."
navy,3bqs9u,Mr_Weebles,3,Wed Jul 1 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"An IOWA is nothing to mess with.   The magazines and engine rooms were protected by an armored belt 12.2 inches (310 mm) thick.  They fired projectiles weighing from 1,900 to 2,700 pounds (860 to 1,220 kg) at a muzzle velocity of 2,690 ft/s (820 m/s)(1834.1 mph"
navy,3bqs9u,Twisky,3,Wed Jul 1 19:34:35 2015 UTC,We also have older BB's taking more cumulative damage. The Nevada for instance took a torpedo and 6 500kg bombs and was still sailing and fighting under her own power.  Every ship ever built can be killed with the unlucky hit but the Iowa's were built to shrug off shells heavier and faster then an Exocet.
navy,3bqs9u,DBHT14,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:05:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but then you have stories like those from the various battles of Savo Island with BBs and CAs trading shells at ranges of under a mile wih IJN ships where shells from 5 and 8 in guns were punching through armored steel. The armored belts of the BBs were designed to stop a 16 shell from 10 miles away, not much can stop the sheer kinetic force of a armor piercing naval shell at point blank range. But that being said a missile has much less kinetic force."
navy,3bqs9u,weinerpretzel,2,Thu Jul 2 05:03:09 2015 UTC,"Well said. Though many of the penetrations had much to do with the ""all or nothing"" scheme which the Navy went with immediately before WW1, essentially take all the armor which would be spread around the ship, and concentrate it around the engines, conning tower, main battery and enough hull to keep it floating, everything else gets enough to just support the weight or torpedo bulges and voids built on."

Assuming the commie bastard was flying an SU-27 Flanker, which was their version of our fourth gen fighter jets like the F-14 and shit.  Things got a fuckin top speed of 1500 MPH, so it would take 6 minutes at full speed for the commie to get from his commie position to our hand-built American carrier.  So basically, it's not a serious threat at that range, but it could become a threat very quickly, so they put our boys in the air just in case."

What's always been crazy to me is that if you have the slightest awareness of what you are looking at in those scenes it is basically hours of footage just randomly cut together. Here's a Tomcat rolling to the cat, now here's an Intruder. Oh, here's a Tomcat coming in on a touch and go, flip away and back, now it's another aircraft coming in to trap, cut away and back and we have another touch and go - and so on. It's all disjointed and doesn't make any sense.  And you probably saw this in your lists - but if a catapult is broken, it's not going to be fixed in five minutes.  I still like watching it on occasion because it does take me back. I loved getting up on deck for the first event of the day and watching all those Tomcats going into full blower - good times."

While the 80s engagement ranges were inside 150nm due to the radar guidance limitations of the time you better believe that is no longer an issue. If anything today range is more theoretical than a limitation.   Read open source about China's land based radar systems and the max range of their short and medium range icbms and you get an idea of just how far a threat range can be.

navy,3bpirg,Esuu,2,Wed Jul 1 15:46:55 2015 UTC,At that time and to my knowledge it is still the case that carriers have missile launchers. But if anything gets in close to the carrier there is a problem as there are not just the aircraft but the whole carrier group which is there to protect the carrier. So ideally nothing should ever get through. (It happens but shouldn't)  When I was on the Vinson in the 80's we had a CG right close all the time for plane guard and then a slew of other ships in the group that were usually around.

On the PRR your official flight will go from your duty station to the port of debarkation. Under that you put preferred alternate routings.  You can only have ONE alternate routing, ie you can't put Japan > Boston > Denver > Japan. You'd have to put Japan > Boston > Japan. NAVPTO will do a cost comparison (max $ is like $1800) and book your flight. THEN once you get your itinerary you can change your flight with SATO or the airline for more alternate routings. As stated earlier NAVPTO has to compare costs of the original flight to the one you want and they do have a Max $$ but its almost 2k so you should be able to change your flight to whatever you want.  Hope this helps."

Beef Jerky nuts water flavors/enhancers like Mio those Coffee Mate To Go thingies.  Sriracha Sauce Coffee.  PopTarts Gushers/Fruit Roll Ups Ramen Noodles Oreos or other cookies.  As your buddy is a SEAL, he might be a bit more picky about healthy food stuff. Maybe throw in some protein powder or dried fruit if you can find the kind that isn't soaked in sugar before they dry it.   Hygiene:  Do not put in the same box as foodstuffs. Your food will taste like soap and deodorant and that sucks.    Any ""pod"" laundry detergent, or my personal favorite the 3-in-1 Purel sheets.  Deodorant Foot powder Wet wipes, although: I hesitate to put this on the list, but I doubt your friend will be near any shipboard toilets, so I suppose my plumbing systems are safe. (Don't flush wet wipes, people. Just, don't. even if they say flushable, they aren't.).

Small toys like a nerf gun or water balloons (again, depending on where he's deployed this might bring him great amusement or be a terrible idea).  Dip or cigs, even if he doesn't use tobacco.  A hard drive with movies and music.  A top-seller book or sudoku, crosswords, magazines (tattoo, gun, and car mags are all good choices. I used to suggest Readers Digest but they steal all their content from Reddit these days).  A water bottle or two, a travel coffee mug, a protein shaker bottle.

When I use to receive care packages from my friends and family and even strangers while deployed I received things like, toilet paper, razors, deck of cards, shaving cream, bath wash, etc...  99% of basic supplies and most advanced supplies are available to servicemen while they are deployed.  Add home-made stuff, we had one guy use to receive home-made brownies, and they were amazing and all the rave.  Stuff like that. Also, Chewing Tobacco, it can be purchased on the ship and overseas, and if he's a SEAL, and really is out in some wayward area, and he does chew, he probably has his own.  Home-made stuff, creative stuff.  When I started receiving my favorite candies, ""Peach Rings"", small things like that which we didn't have access too, that made it so much more warm. Hope this helps."

navy,3blktw,TheBeneGesseritWitch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:03:32 2015 UTC,I would advise against sending any baked goods as it could take months to get there depending on where you are. My grandma sent me some banana bread and things like that on my first deployment. It took about two months for me to get it. When we went to mail call we couldn't figure out why the whole ship smelled funny on the way back until I opened my package and gassed out the shop with moldy breads and things.

navy,3bo1mo,haze_gray,3,Tue Jun 30 19:38:51 2015 UTC,"Former Navy recruiter here...    People lie.  People lie to their recruiters.  More often than not, there's some other sort of reason that coupled with his criminal record, makes him ineligible for Naval service.  As someone else stated, the Navy is not hurting for people right now.  Every applicant is tracked by the recruiter, the office, and the ""zone"" that the office is located in.  I'm guessing that 1 of 2 things is happening.  1) your friend is not qualified.  for whatever reason.  2) your friend is qualified, but requires a lot of work to make him fully qualified.  Recruiting is a very fast paced job.  It's far easier for the recruiter to pick the low hanging fruit, than put in hours of windshield time tracking down every document he needs for enlistment.    Depending on the station, and how it achieves goals, usually the last week of the month and the first week of the month are the busiest.  Tell your boy to go down there the second or third week of the month, and speak with the recruiter, or the station LPO.  tell him to straight up ask if he's qualified, and if there is anything he can do to improve his qualification.  Many times, if the applicant is willing to put in the work, the recruiter will take him more seriously.    good luck!"
navy,3bo1mo,smallpaul1980,2,Wed Jul 1 13:41:23 2015 UTC,Another reason was that he has gauges holes and he has already expressed that he is saving up to have surgery to have them closed. He is very serious about doing whatever it takes to join.
navy,3bo1mo,smallpaul1980,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:48:49 2015 UTC,"Welp, there you go.  I wouldn't work with him till it was corrected, but I wouldn't completely blow him off either.  A recruiter should have 2 ""lists"" of applicants.  One list that's ready to join today, and a list of people that require some work to enlist.  So your friend is obviously on the second list.    Also, be forewarned that this now brings medical documents into the mix.  When the recruiter pulls his med docs for the ears, anything else medically related could now be in those docs.  What may have not been discovered before, might make him not qualified."
navy,3bo1mo,AnonymousUser02,2,Tue Jul 7 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"If his criminal history is felony related, there's no use in him trying.  Also, depending on the type of charge or quantity of, sometimes that an auto no-go too.  The Navy is looking for quality these days, not quantity.  It's unfortunate for some but the trend has been found that people with that type of documented history don't last long and typically waste the Navy's time and money.  Now, if it's not so serious and something workable and his recruiter is running from work, find another recruiter. Somebody will take him. Trust me.    ex recruiter"

Never did figure that one out as I was a recruiter in neighboring Muncie, IN years ago and NEVER turned anyone way like that...I strung a few along for a week or so to carry them over to next month's quota, but never ignored someone."

navy,3bkwpe,usnthrowaway678,8,Tue Jun 30 01:37:49 2015 UTC,"Finally!!!! Some shit I can aptly respond to. I'm a 2009 graduate of the US merchant marine academy and I've done about a year and a half of active duty time with the Navy (Afghanistan and C schools) and sailed a year on commercial and MSC ships.   First off, I love shipping out. It's awesome because of the travel and experience. Even crap ships have fun memories. But, there are two sides to every coin. The time away from the family is rough. Jobs are reliable, but they're not always reliably high paying. Some officer jobs can pay as low as 6k a month without overtime. Coming from enlisted Navy, this might seem high, but it's not. Also, unions are a pain in the ass to deal with. And some shipping jobs require sailing for 11 months a year.   So, that's the negative. But, the positive is pretty powerful. Time off means you're home with nothing other to do than hang out with your family and be dad. No pt tests and dealing with command stuff. Friends that are fathers love it. The pay can start out pretty crappy, but a career in the merchant marine can get you a lot of money over your lifetime. And, an unlicensed person can easily reach the highest ranks with gumption and luck. Drug tests aren't random, and people don't bust your nuts all day about stupid shit. Operation is all that matters.   So, what matters most is what you want and what you're trying to do with your wife/family. PM me with serious questions. I'll give you my thoughts.

So after you get your DD214 go to the nearest military base (any service) and sign up for their TAPS class. Granted many things will not apply to you because you are already separated but they still have great information. I recommend attending one closes near where you will set up residence because sometimes these classes offer up good POC for nearby job openings, discounted items from interview suits to college courses. Good Luck! As for your last paycheck, it can be held up to a couple of months due to account being reconcile to make sure you don't owe the govt money. But considering you already saw the payment once and it disappeared later in the day, that is something that happens frequently with NFCU, so sounds like your deposit is coming.

navy,3bibsp,Graahle,6,Mon Jun 29 13:37:27 2015 UTC,"Living arrangements: As an undes, more likely than not you're gonna be living on the ship. While the GW was here, I heard about a lot of sailors getting barracks rooms based on their time and behavior while on board. Who knows, you might be one of the lucky ones. At least in my barracks, you have a 10' x 20' space with desks, a closet, and a bed. Basics, but welcome basics. Relationships: That's more on the person than anything. If you're going to do your best to try to make a LDR work, more power to you. Some people just don't have the patience or commitment (or both) to make it work. As for visitation from family/SOs, totally doable. You're gonna have to file for a visitor's pass, but that can be done at the Main Gate and takes like 10min. Personal items: Again, more on the individual. You're on a ship, so that's gonna be whatever your sponsor says to bring. As for anything else, whatever works for you I guess. Pay: You're gonna get COLA (cost of living allowance) and maybe BAS (basic allowance for subsistence). If you live off base <very small chance as a new sailor>, you'll get other allowances as well. Do yourself a favor, and put about 30% from each pay period away into some type of savings account or certificate. No numbers, but I'm leaving with more than enough for a brand new car, used motorcycle, AR-15 built to my personal taste, and a new pistol. You can easily save up. Just depends on how much.   As for the base itself, it's not bad at all. Across the ships, you'll have the Fleet Recreation Center with a cardio floor, a gym with a sweet weight room, uniform shop, and food court with free (albeit meh speed) wifi. You've also got access to two on-base theaters that charge close to nothing (but you're gonna have to stand at attention before each show....yea...), the NEX has an ok selection of electronics but great clothes, and traveling around Japan is way too much fun. My personal advice?....   Do NOT be the barracks/ship rat. Get the hell off base and enjoy the country while you're here. There is much fun to be had >>WITHOUT DRINKING<<. For real, you're gonna be on a ship. You're gonna be around people who drink. A LOT. Of them, one of them is going to get you into serious trouble. Don't be that guy. Learn the language. Japanese was easy for me to learn. There are dozens of free apps to learn Japanese with (Learn Japanese Lite for the most basic and common phrases is what I recommend). Learn how the train system works, and get yourself a Pasmo or Suica Card. Traveling around Japan can be somewhat frustrating at first, but when you learn the system, it becomes a matter of figuring where to visit next.  Don't be that guy who gets a full body suit or sleeve. This one just makes my stomach turn. I got tattoos while I was here, but no body suit, or sleeve for that matter. True story, I actually say two guys who actually had the exact same sleeve. They ""claimed"" that they went to different shops. When everyone has them, it's no longer special. If you plan on getting a tattoo, make it something that's special. Plus, if you do get a traditional sleeve or body suit, you're gonna get turned away from many businesses because of the connotations. (If you're deadset on getting a tattoo in Yokosuka, go to Ambitionz in Yokosuka, right behind the Shell Station outside the gate, ask for Ai)   Hope this helps to address some of your concerns.

This is different than blowing your paychecks consistently on a ton of shit month to month, how?  Obviously you can do whatever the hell you want with your money, I really truly do not care, but when I think saving money to save. I think a tad more long term than, well I'll just blow it on things that depreciate like crazy later, instead of today."

You CAN travel on orders if they are official travel orders, however US Military identification is a perfectly legal source of entry into the country to/from.  If you have a passport, they will stamp it, if not, they check your ID and let you through.  I was stationed in Japan, Sasebo for three years and made a total of five trips home using my military ID.  It's in the SOFA.  Flights home are expensive, I paid between $1600-2000 depending on when your command will let you buy the ticket.  With regards to ""undesignated seaman"", it's not so bad, definitely hard work, but some of the most rewarding from what my BM friends tell me.  You aren't the only one, who fails out of special programs, go heal/toughen up in the fleet, and re-apply in two years.    Drop the idea of keeping your current phone plan, a copy of your orders will allow you to break your contract and not be charged an early termination fee from whoever your cellular provider is.  You will get a new phone in Japan, dokomo, softbank, etc...they carry the same kinds of phones we have, and you can even set them for English, you'll just have a different number but you and all your friends will have them.    I was in Yokosuka for a few months during a training exercise, we were home ported out of Sasebo, which is more country and huge climate shift.  Yokosuka is like..San Diego weather, you are two hours away from Tokyo by train, and the night life is amazing.  With regards to Japan in general, the people are amazing, helpful, friendly, courteous, you'll learn their ways through a course on base, and as you live there.  Something to note, you might ask your sponsor, Japan has been under HEAVY liberty restrictions ever since some international events happened, a raping by some marines, and a couple of blue on blue, blue on green fights, not sure if they have relaxed those yet or not.  You should inquire.  My biggest regret, was drinking too much.  I didn't enjoy the country, primarily because the OPTEMPO of our ship, we were underway on average 200-250 days of the year.  Drink some, but go an explore, take pictures.  Good luck!"

If you have a family emergency and your ship is floating around Thailand, without that passport you can kiss your emergency leave goodbye. Same for PCSing, if you're required to get underway in the months before you PCS, but the ship can only get you offloaded when they pull into Singapore, and you have no passport--looks like you're getting extended, homes. Granted, this is why you have the option of getting a no-fee passport.....but you can't use that no-fee to go on vacation in other countries.

If he gets caught underage drinking, he will likely lose his rate and go to the fleet undesignated, or they may just kick him out. Tell him this, and then tell him he's risking a lot by it being on Facebook.

I realize it's silly to say, but it's important to tell him that the Navy does not look kindly on underage drinking.  At all.  If an underage Sailor is either found with alcohol (on them, or in their room), or is found to have any evidence of alcohol in their system (a breathalyzer of 0.02%, and some places will screen people as they come back to base) is considered an Alcohol Related Incident: same as a DUI or getting arrested for a bar fight, or similar.  As somebody else pointed out: that is a very, very bad thing.  At best: you get put on the shit list for a long time and career suffers.  At worst: separated from the service.

You have to consider the fact that these are really just young men who are finally out on their own for the first time in their lives, and that sense of freedom is both powerful and intoxicating.  They are free to explore and do things that were never possible before, either due to lack of opportunity or their very incorrect perception that they no longer have to answer to anyone other than themselves.  I am trying to imagine the shame and self-anger they will feel if they are eventually caught, knowing that they basically threw all of their hard work and dreams away over the thrill of going out on the town and getting blitzed.  I'm sure your son was told numerous times in the past (especially in boot camp) to simply ""follow the rules.""  He may not always understand or agree with the rules, but the rules are there for reasons he may or may not ever know or understand.  He may have those photos hidden from the public eye on Facebook, but the Navy has ways of finding out things when their interest is piqued.  I hope your son's actions remain private and he doesn't lose all of the hard work he has put in so far.  If he's caught, I hope the Navy doesn't use him as an example for others.

navy,3besfn,geheim_nav,14,Sun Jun 28 15:50:21 2015 UTC,"""surface warfare officers are sometimes cavalier while landing helicopters, a routine but dangerous evolution""  Unfortunately this is completely true. I'm I SWO myself, and I know that those pilots lives are in my hands if I'm the OOD as they launch, recover, and sit on deck, just like any other evolution like launching a boat or approaching a RAS.  But I've seen complacency creep in when people think they've done it a hundred times and that it's no big deal.  So many alarm bells go off when reading the investigation report. No pilot I've ever worked with would accept 28 knot tail winds (one squadron's rule was 5 max, daylight only, to show how ridiculous 28 is). Being ordered to take station is no excuse, regardless of the Russian or RAS timeline; safety is first unless you're in a shooting war, and I've had to push back on unrealistic demands from Zulu like that before. After the first wave they should have realized their mistake and slowed down, changing course again would only make it worse. Even though it wasn't specified in the regulations, they had all the evidence they needed to make a judgement call for safety.   I may sound like some armchair admiral, but I was onboard for one of the earlier incidents mentioned in the article and it was a rude awakening to our wardroom."
navy,3besfn,chronoserpent,2,Sun Jun 28 21:17:49 2015 UTC,I agree with what you said but going 30 kts in the same direction as a 28kt wind would make it a net 2kt headwind.  So she actually did it correct in that regard.
navy,3besfn,MapleSyrup69,5,Mon Jun 29 01:16:59 2015 UTC,"The natops do not specify requirements for tail winds, but the two squadrons and ~4 dets I've worked with have always been touchy about tail winds regardless of relative head winds. I'm no pilot, but as it was explained to me having true winds abaft the beam make it much harder to slow and approach the ship. Most pilots refused the winds in those situations."
navy,3besfn,chronoserpent,6,Mon Jun 29 07:22:19 2015 UTC,Am Hsl pilot. What we can do and what is safe are two different things.   Can a helo land with true tail winds? Sure. Can any crew anywhere do it safely? No. Helps have crashed for far less.   If there wasn't an emergency you should avoid true tail winds. If the thing is on fire I'll land with a 30 knot tail wind at night if I have to.  But during peace time ops with out shots fired no need for that.   This whole incident is a tragedy and it sucks it took something like this to change the rules.

navy,3besfn,oversizedhat,7,Mon Jun 29 01:30:19 2015 UTC,I kept seeing vague references to making alterations to the flight deck that might have mitigated the risks. What changes could be made?
navy,3besfn,faustrex,9,Sun Jun 28 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"There are few alterations that could realistically be made to the ship.  The main issue is that there was either lack of awareness or a normalization of deviation that created the circumstances that caused the accident.  The order ""proceed at best speed"" (vice ""best speed consistent with conditions"" or ""best safe speed"") probably had a good deal to do with this.  The CO seemed to have avoided responsibility for the mishap (although she probably should have known better, but maybe didn't (see below)), but whoever drafted that order needs to take at least some of the blame.    As the article points out, there was no real need for excessive (or anything close to) speed in relocating the ship given the facts imparted.  Why, then, use those words in the order?  Had the CO been taken to some formal review, her lawyer could have easily gotten around the ""well, she had a responsibility for safe operation"" line by specifically pointing to the words of the order.  And, yes, there is always the ""well, that isn't what I meant"" weasel, but that shouldn't count.  I can't tell what you meant: I can only tell what you ordered.  You ordered ""best speed"".  That is what you got.  The other issue may relate to the (general) lack of at sea conning time that current CO/XOs are likely to have.  Compared to other navies, and the merchant marine, the U.S. Navy officer has frighteningly little experience conning a ship when they are senior.  There are many reasons for this (ticket punching, demands for officers to have joint and other experiences, et al), but the fact remains that if the CO had more time conning this and like ships in flight ops they would have been aware (on both an intellectual and gut level) of the risks associated with high speed operation as regards safety on the flight deck in these ships with low freeboard in that area."
navy,3besfn,WIlf_Brim,9,Sun Jun 28 18:04:01 2015 UTC,"This has been a huge issue for many years - SWOs don't seem to get enough time at sea as OOD. And sometimes it seems that some SWOs can ""slip"" through the system and attain XO or CO positions without the level of ship control that you would expect (i.e. a ninja level of ship control)."
navy,3besfn,looktowindward,2,Sun Jun 28 21:29:08 2015 UTC,"What about the Air Boss (or whoever)? Isn't there somebody on the flight deck who can say, ""This is dangerous,"" and cancel operations? I honestly don't know much about how the Dets operate, so I'm just speculating, but I find it hard to believe that there is a single point of failure here."
navy,3besfn,Warbond,3,Mon Jun 29 01:11:51 2015 UTC,"All of the events described happened either before or after flight ops.  The guidance was after the deck is declared ""red"" (aircraft chained) the ship can maneuver however the OOD (or whoever else may have the conn) decides.  Anybody back aft really doesn't have much say."
navy,3besfn,WIlf_Brim,2,Mon Jun 29 01:21:25 2015 UTC,"Okay, I understand red deck/amber deck/green deck, but somebody back aft must have had reservations about doing maintenance during what was apparently a pretty shitty sea state.  Then again, even if things look okay on a certain course and it appears safe to conduct that sort of maintenance, there's no telling how the ship may be steered after that. So that makes sense. I see your point, thanks."
navy,3besfn,Warbond,6,Mon Jun 29 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the decision to without the CO of the ships promotion to Captain. She was operating within established NATOPS limits which specifically stated the ship is free to maneuver once the helo is chocked and chained. How can you punish her if she was following NATOPS?  It was a freak accident. Naval aviation is inherently dangerous.   Also, I dislike how a spouse of one of the pilots was able to lobby to remove her name from the promotion list.

navy,3bgtza,MatthewMateo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"O,  ok that's cool.   Just to make sure, you're saying that it's pretty much a hundred percent impossible to strike for an AC rate in the pact airman program right?"
navy,3bgtza,RandomTexts,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:16:22 2015 UTC,"It's not 100% impossible. I don't know the actual probability. Sorry, I didn't mean to be confusing.   I do know that there are people being accepted into the rate all of the time. We have new kids check in every few months.  I wouldn't accept an undesignated contract with the Navy. I don't see why you couldn't just join to be an AC. Talk to a different recruiting office or area. If you have to wait X months, then so be it.  Lemme talk do some people this week and I'll get back to you. I know a few people."
navy,3bgtza,RandomTexts,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:53:13 2015 UTC,"That's cool.  thank you so much I appreciate it.  I've pretty much made up my mind not to do the pact airman. I thought it would be cool, but the more I read about it the less promising it sounds.  I'm too passionate about ATC.  You know, I've got thousands of dollars in this for education.  We will see how it gos with the classifier.  I'll be at MEPS on Thursday😆  very excited."
navy,3bgtza,voodoo_curse,2,Tue Jul 7 01:06:19 2015 UTC,"AC2 here. Like everyone else has already said, take an AC contract or nothing. I posted some helpful info for another guy a few weeks ago. He was a civilian controller trying to go Navy AC. Just search through my post history and you'll find it."

But the more I read these kind of things the more skeptical I am about it. I'm going to MEPS next week.   The recruiters are already telling me to take what they have. But its not them that has thousands of dollars in student loans to do a job. I'm starting to think that if AC isn't available,  I won't do the packet been. I'll just come home and finish my associate's degree for air traffic control specialist."

After learning what I have about the pact airman program this weekend.  I'm beginning to think that it would really be a waste of my time.  The way I see it I could either spend the next year learning about air traffic control here at middle Georgia State University or I could be learning that at something like A school.

Technically possible, yes, but good luck being an undesignated airman getting enough time off during flight ops to work in CATCC. I've seen several people try to strike AC, never seen one succeed. He'd be better off doing 2 years in another rate and crossrating."
navy,3bgtza,SaucyMittsChris,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:02:41 2015 UTC,"That's not how that works. You don't go clean fucking pad eyes all day in the Hanger Bay or some shit and then catch some Case III events or something at the end of the night. You get selected for your rate and if it requires an A School, they send you when you get orders.  We had an undesignated Sailor out of V-2 get picked up for AC so the DLCPOs made a deal and he's temporary TAD to OC until he leaves for A School."

navy,3behba,claychastain,6,Sun Jun 28 17:04:48 2015 UTC,"For a carrier nuke, uniforms. At least 5 sets of coveralls(see Rex-Goliath's reply below) and 3 weeks worth of socks, underwear, and blue T-shirts. Our engineering spaces aren't air conditioned (some parts can get up to 130F, with 100% humidity when you're in the gulf), so you will be sweating. A lot. Also, there will be some sort of issue that takes laundry down for a week. Unless you enjoy being smelly, the extra clothes will come in handy.  EDIT: Actually, a few more things to add, since most of the tips here seem to be sub-oriented.  First off, don't worry about bringing any sort of tobacco; it is pretty easy to come by underway, since we get resupplied often. If you're looking to buy checkouts goodwill, generally stuff from the ship's store will do the trick anyway.  For entertainment, feel free to bring a kindle, handheld gaming system, or a cheap laptop that you wouldn't mind losing. External HDDs are also a good recommendation, and not just porn, but any sort of popular TV show can be worth a lot. Hell, if you're reporting mid-deployment, up-to-date episodes of popular shows and newly released movies could be enough to make you ""the cool NUB"". What you should not bring is a new $3000 gaming laptop, because you won't have a whole lot of time to play it, plus it could wind up stolen.  Other good stuff to bring: Pens, a credit card with no foreign transaction fees, a good water bottle that will fit into a coverall pocket, a good coffee cup (learn to drink it, you will need the caffeine, and it will save you a small fortune on energy drinks), multivitamins (veggies and fruit on the ship will vary in quality from ""eh, that's edible, I guess"" to vile), a sturdy coat hanger to dry your towel on, an initial supply of workout supplements (if you're big into lifting; you can order more underway, but it will take 3-4 weeks to show up), shower shoes, and a good set of bedding (pillow, sheets, and maybe a sleeping bag if you're stationed in WA. Make sure to check with your ship to see exactly what is and isn't allowed).  Also, the obligatory closing remark: Underway is prime time for quals. Especially while you're still in RT and not getting thrown on the watchbill all the time. Get out of the RT spaces and down in the plant. Learn from the watchstanders, they are probably bored out of their goddamn minds, and there is nothing a nuke likes more than feeling intellectually superior to somebody by dropping a ton of knowledge on them. A cold soda in a hot plant can get you a lot of signatures adequate checkouts. Try to get as many UIs and practical factors as you can. Not only will it give you a leg up, but it will get your face out to your division. Few things will hurt you more than showing up to division and everybody going ""who the fuck is this guy?"".  Double-edit: also, if they ask, you want to go to M-div."

I have no experience with that platform (I was on a DDG), but here is what I brought:   Plenty of spare socks, underwear, and white t-shirts Spare bottles of body wash and more razors than I thought I needed  Pens. Lots and lots of pens. The biggest navy in the world seemingly has trouble keeping pens in stock, and the minute you leave your pen unattended someone is gonna steal it. Bring extras.    As I said, I was on a different platform but I feel these basics should be universal. Oh and bring some old-fashioned porn magazines too.

The rest is up to you after that. After all, you're probably going to be hot racking with a clown who brought two seabags of bullshit.   I bought a 13 inch MacBook Air for minor gaming and movie watching, 2 2TB HDDs (the kind that don't need external power) with movies and TV shows, an iPod for working back aft, and my cell phone with a couple of books downloaded.   I was unqualified at the time I left but it's easy to get qualified literally everything in the span of 6+ months.

You will spend time getting qualified, and then be bored out of your mind.  Anything you could think to ever possibly want to watch or play, bring it.   Also, games on your phone are very convenient.  Comfortable shoes for lots of walking for liberty ports.  Light fitting long sleeve shirts (past elbow) and pants for middle east ports.  Dryer sheets, personal stash of food / snacks from home that you wont get.  Mattress pad for your rack, if its too wide, cut in half and have twice as much padding like I do and a comfortable blanket / pillows.  Also, I am the only one I know who did it, but a shoe rack that fits into your stand up saves tons of space.  All dress uniforms can be folded and still be just fine when you wear them, and i fit 2 weeks worth of clothing and workout clothes, toiletries, and tupperware full of protein inside my stand up.

And then you can just refill the card every time you run out. I probably wouldn't bring my primary smart phone next deployment; I wouldn't want to lose it or get it stolen. It's much better to get a cheapo on eBay or buy a burner. Be forewarned the actual phone itself is cheaper in the States.

(I've spent a hot minute on shore duty away from a real HT shop, hence ""they"" instead of ""we""....)  However. Everything about welding in the navy does not translate smoothly to civilian welding. Different terms, different configurations sometimes, just everything is different. The principles and mechanics are the same, and even if you get your USMAPPS Journeyman Cert you still have to requalify locally with each company or union. Easy to do (mechanics are the same!), but if you get out and go to a trade school you're gonna be like ""WTF did those HTs teach me?!""  Also most civ welders do GMAW/GTAW and we do SMAW (but if you ask an HT they'll say ""arc/stick, mig, or tig,"" and not easily associate the terms GTAW, GMAW, FCAW, SMAW etc)"

navy,3bbb7o,fozzit,2,Sun Jun 28 05:32:01 2015 UTC,"True. Unless you qualify for something not available, you will be living on base. Animals do not count in family considerations.  Edit: There are tower apartments and townhomes, both on 'main base' and in Ikego, the housing area about 10km from base. They have the same square footage, different floor plans. I like not doing yard work, personally, and it's quieter in my tower. And no one's dog shits on my front lawn."
navy,3bbb7o,Poopkitty,2,Sun Jun 28 06:48:03 2015 UTC,"When I was there Base Housing would try and force you into Ikego housing, which I can't recall how far it was from Yoko-base, but it would require a commute to work. Something I didn't want and there is a comfort-factor being on the main base.     Also the townhomes are more desirable because you get a yard and don't have to worry about people above/below you. I turned down all my offers until they gave me a townhouse on base. I took all the time they afforded me in the Navy Lodge."

navy,3bbb7o,jpguerriero,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:40:33 2015 UTC,So here's the thing. As others have said there is no financial benefit to a house mate in Japan. But if you are headed to Atsugi you can get a small place up in shibuya and then live with a roommate in a flat near Yamato so you have no commute to work.   One of you rents the shibuya place.  The other rents the Yamato place.   You will be deployed six months+ out of the year anyway so the roommate situation shouldn't bother you. And it saves you having to worry about trains on the weekend assuming you want to do stuff in Tokyo.   Doesn't really apply to yoko sasvegas or oki.

My guess is that they will create corresponding NECs for UAS operators under the AW (Aviation Warfare Systems Operators) rating.  Also, I am quite certain that unmanned air vehicles will be in the fleet and operational in the coming decades."

So you go in as HM0000, then you go through training, then you have a NEC,for example HM8404.This is similar to what it would it take to be a UAS/UAV Operator Sailor?

The training piplines are so different that they dont translate to the other programs well. Selection phase is selection phase, nothing more nothing less. I made it pretty far and my asvab is an 86, but all i was offered was EN on a sub, CS, LS, BM, all the undes rates, and CT-R.

I was class 70-2 back at the ass end of 2011, the detailer told us that the Special Operatins and other Spec Warfare jobs weren't available because of some new regulation stated we needed to wait two years before trying for one of them again. Idk if that was BS or what, but none of us (the bud/s guys included) that were in my pool of failures at the detailer got anything other than UNDES or any good rates.. except for one lucky fucker that beat us all out for the one available CTR billet...

navy,3b55xx,Godbolte,7,Fri Jun 26 01:36:45 2015 UTC,Maybe try cross posting your question to /r/conspiracy.  They seem to know  more sources over there.
navy,3b55xx,peacemomma,6,Fri Jun 26 03:28:58 2015 UTC,"The last I heard the courts allowed a suit to be filed. It goes to court this July.  I was originally intending to be part of that whole mess. But I really figured that by the time anything ever came of it, the lawyer who is taking 30 percent and the rest of the claimants take their cut I would be looking at little to no payouts. I am healthy for now and that is just fine with me.   Now..   As far as people think that it is a conspiracy I can offer some insight into what happened during that time.   We were told we were going to assist in aid efforts and that there was damage to a nuclear facility with an ""unknown level"" of contamination in the area. We stayed off the coast and despite comments made officially we were close enough to see individual trees and the ship slowly lumbered through the debris field. The second day we spent washing aircraft that had flown over the countryside and were suddenly stopped as ""the water was contaminated"". We were told to not drink or shower as the sensors in the ship had detected higher levels of contamination in the potable water.   Our access to topside was through the foc'sle dressed in full contam gear. We returned through the same area and were scanned with geiger counters upon rentry. Anything over 1000 rad was considered bad and was discarded. Clothing you were wearing that set off the devices was taken and we were told burned or thrown over the side.   We were limited to who could go up on deck and we constantly had working parties to load the choppers with food and water. The ship became a floating supply barge. I was one of those people.    After we left the AOR, we continued a pretty basic depoyment. I was airwing and our aircraft were quarentined upon arrival stateside where they were fully disassembled and scanned with geiger counters and cleaned."
navy,3b55xx,Magramel,7,Fri Jun 26 04:41:36 2015 UTC,Was a chopper pilot flying with a Geiger counter strapped to my chest. I landed on your ship many time for supply and was on one of the cruisers in company.   No one from my ship has gotten sick. And no one from my squadron who flew has. But we were Atsugi based not Ronald Reagan air wing.   I personally flew right through the plume from Fukushima one day. The aircraft skin was totally contaminated. Our Geiger counters and personal indicators never registered anything inside the aircraft though. But we left the bird on deck and gave it a countermeasure wash that afternoon so it could be cleaned. They ended up scrapping the air intakes on the oil cooler when we got back.   It was a crazy time to be in Japan.   I hope I don't get cancer. I have been screened by non navy docs and came back normal 3 years later. So o figure if I cop it later in life oh well.   Giving water to the survivors and moving doctors and sick people around was worth it. The locals copped it far worse than we did.

We received the Humanitarian Assistance and the Join Meritorious Unit Award, the entire strike group did, and all commands/ships, if anyone needs a copy of the message PM me, I have it.  Now, to clear up some of the confusion...the argument that I believe is being made is not the fact sailors were coming back dirty.  The problem I heard was that, Naval Warships were not fitted to process alpha contaminants out of the water. The Japanese specifically said no radiation had leaked into the water, and this was an important factor in the USN's decision to station her ship off the coast and provide HADR operations.  Months later, during investigations it was made known that the Japanese power companies had lied and radiation did make it into the water.    The argument is that, USN ships process their potable water, (drinking, showering, etc...) from sea water.  Were the ships rated to filter out radiated contaminants?  I honestly don't know and haven't noticed any abnormal conditions as of this time.  It's been a few years now.    I do recall having to take the iodine tablets during quarters, and we had similar conditions with regards to our ship being locked down, Geiger counters in play, etc..

On the other hand direct rating conversion is more specific: If approved you effectively get converted into the desired rate immediately, without having to go the normal route through an ""A"" school. It seems some ratings let you take the advancement exam to directly convert, other ratings don't need the exam but do require you to be already rated in a similar specialty.

navy,3b0jw4,BlackSquirrel05,4,Thu Jun 25 15:49:51 2015 UTC,"The article reads like a smear against the DoN for renewing XP rather than upgrading, but it's not that simple.   Think about how many computers are in your office/boat/whatever. Multiply that Navy-wide, and we're talking thousands, maybe more. Upgrading each to Windows 7, or 8, will cost millions. Then there all the programs, albeit some pretty shitty, that would need to upgrade or optimize to run on Windows 7 machines.  I'm not defending the DoN when it is clearly a priority to upgrade, but the article only shows a small sample, not the whole story."

The harrier is not exactly a great fighter, and frankly I think the V/STOL version for the F-35 is a joke because it's range is so limited.  I just think if they ever actually armed an Su-33 and took off, it wouldn't be able to carry much in the way of weaponry and they still haven't mastered arrested landings.

The Borei uses hull ring sections from cancelled Akulas and electric propulsion motors from Kilos.  The Sevrodvinsk class is reusing main engines from decommissioned Oscar IIs.

At the core of our efforts are three governing principles: Make it easy for every person involved in Navy PMS to do the right thing and conversely, make it hard to do something wrong.   Do something once and reuse it for the remainder of the maintenance process. Eliminate process steps that don't add direct value to maintenance effectiveness.   Out of the 2020 Vision project came the current ""Future of PMS"" snip   Yes, there really is no step 3. We are really truly being ran by the fucking underpants gnomes from South Park.  3M is the biggest reason I'm separating after my first enlistment. I'm not some whiner either. I'm the guy that made E-6 in one enlistment in an incredibly competitive rating.  Here is a random facebook grab of some of the random crap I worked on as a civilian:  http://imgur.com/a/QWGqk  There are MAYBE a few hundred people in this country qualified/certified to play on the level I was at as an automotive mechanic. This is not a boast. This is fact. This is simply to establish my authority to speak about what it takes to maintain INCREDIBLY expensive and complicated shit.   That silver Ferrari 250GT would cost about an entire LCAC's worth of money to replace. In my early 20's, I was 100% solely responsible for the care and feeding of something worth what an LCAC costs, and I MAYBE saw that thing once/year. One can't simply order parts for that thing either. The rest of the year I had millions of dollars worth of other non-replaceable things pass through my hands. Oh yeah, somewhere in that album is also THE Elanor from gone in 60 seconds.  I frequently get asked what the fuck I'm doing in the Navy. I think that statement speaks more to our cultural failings than anything. You often hear about only the top 1% of Americans are qualified to serve in the military. My presence shouldn't be an anomaly if that were the truth. The question should be ""Why aren't we getting more of your professional peers involved in our organization"".  I have struggled for a lot of years to answer that question.  I think it ultimately boils down to accountability and professional standards.   A CPO is supposed to be the subject matter expert in their rating. Why in the everloving fuck is a 5.0 in block 33/34 for professional knowledge and quality of work not a hard and fast requirement to even be considered for a CPO board? Oh wait, our entire advancement/eval system is incredibly fucked.  If the CPO mess as a whole (I'm not saying there aren't individually incredible Chief's out there) wasn't the weakest link in the entire Navy organization, the 3M system would be radically different. A Chief should know his equipment. A Chief should be able to roll through a space in an hour, and be like ""Hey! MM3, Why the fuck hasn't that pump been lubricated? Fix it!"" Or ""Hey! FC3! Why is the preamp gain that radar receiver totally fucking whacked out?! Fix it!"" If these things aren't fixed, the Chief should do all of that posturing bullshit that happens during their induction and FUCKING FIX THE PROBLEM! No administrative burden or paperwork should be required for ANYTHING beyond ordering a part for broken equipment, as we should all have professional standards to do what's required.  These clueless goobers are then being led around by some more incredibly clueless motherfuckers in the JO community. Why the shit is somebody with a degree in interpretive dance studies telling a ""knowledgeable"" subject matter expert how to do their job. Instead we have a bunch of spineless ""career oriented"" motherfuckers in the CPO mess that roll over for a fucking Ensign over the definition of what a wrench really is.  3M is not the problem. 3M should fucking work as intended. 3M also requires people in positions of authority to have a fucking clue about what they are doing and the conviction and principals to stand up for what is required to keep the Navy functioning.  Instead we have a culture that gives us the 3M system we have now.  The problem isn't with the 3M system. The problem is with the Navy professional culture.  /u/Titus142 really hit the nail on the head. This is a cultural problem. Not a problem with one specific program."

navy,3az4fv,papafrog,3,Wed Jun 24 17:51:21 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of discussion on /r/newtothenavy about the difference. Basically, if you intend on doing college and you want to lead people and do a large variety of things, go Officer. E's will have leadership to a lesser degree, a poorer quality of life, less pay, less responsibility, but much more detailed job experience--they'll do one rate, and do that throughout their career."

navy,3az4fv,BurningBushes2000,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:55:35 2015 UTC,I personally think OCS is better because you can go to school and major in whatever you want and pursue your goals/passion without the navy telling you what to major in or rolling the dice on what designator you get sent too.
navy,3az4fv,WanderingSailor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:15:59 2015 UTC,"You can still major in whatever you want in NROTC, it's just a bit harder with a non-STEM.

navy,3az95u,sayertindall,3,Wed Jun 24 18:16:34 2015 UTC,"Your report no later than date is the absolute latest you can check into your gaining command, if you show up after the 13th you will be UA.   You are usually given 4 days proceed time but that is determined by the specific language of your orders (MILPERSMAN 1320-090). Proceed time is time allotted to allow you to get yourself ready to move and is not charged as leave or travel days.   Then you get travel time of 1 day per 400 miles, rounded up (JTR sec 3025) and calculated from quarterdeck to quarterdeck. With a distance of roughly 3000 miles you should get 8 days, but there is an official calculator so don't quote me.  That means the Navy gave you 12 days to get everything you need from NPTU to NS Bremerton. If you wait until July 13th to report you will be charged leave for those days in excess of the 12. Do yourself a favor and give yourself plenty of time to safely drive the distance from your leave location to WA. Your new chain won't be very happy if you kill yourself on a cannonball run from Ohio on Sunday afternoon."
navy,3az95u,weinerpretzel,2,Wed Jun 24 23:32:53 2015 UTC,currently waiting at medical and don't have any instruction on hand but  what I recall is that if you check in later than the 30 days of leave you'll be in the hole. Check in before your 30 days is up

navy,3az95u,pohnny,0,Wed Jun 24 20:02:42 2015 UTC,Your orders are generally cut for travel time. You may need an ordmord to account for your leave time.
navy,3az95u,Titus142,0,Wed Jun 24 20:15:36 2015 UTC,"Id be willing to bet those extra days are travel time. The Navy expects you to only drive x amount of miles per day so they calculate how far it is and come up with your ""travel days"".  Your losing command (school) has no control over you after you leave fuck what they say. Your gaining command expects you to be there by July 13th. You can always arrive early to save leave days but again, your ""travel"" days are essentially free time off.  You will never be given CONUS orders and offered more than 30 days of leave."

The issue might be that your lang is manned or overmanned and, if accepted, you may have to go for a different language. Not the worst thing in the world because you'll still be able the DLPT in your previously known language and pick up that NEC."
navy,3ay78w,zbeptz,3,Wed Jun 24 16:45:19 2015 UTC,"Not choose at that time. You can always request the DLPT and, if you pass, pick up the NECs. That opens up billets for you down the road. Or, you could always negotiate orders back to school in those languages if there is a spot open  Edit: don't get me wrong, going into a language you don't like sucks.

navy,3atz9f,fleetsheets11,6,Tue Jun 23 14:20:53 2015 UTC,You should offer customizable rate/rank/name embroidery; too. Preferably in a nonvisible-when-the-rack-is-made spot.   I'd be seriously annoyed if I bought custom sheets and had to sharpie my name on them before sending them to laundry.
navy,3atz9f,TheBeneGesseritWitch,3,Tue Jun 23 14:27:42 2015 UTC,"I remember when these first came out, I think. IIRC, it was a sub guy's wife that was running the show. That might be why there aren't names on them by default: we do our own laundry on the boat (or we draw straws as a division).  Don't get me wrong, it's a great idea. I'm rotating back to sea (a PCU, actually) and think I'll be buying a set from the site once we're waterborne. If they offer embroidery I'll shell out for it. That would make it impossible for the pieces to relocate without suspicion."

New class.... Fucking God... Everything is made from scratch from materials that aren't anywhere close to accurate.  The best thing you can do is earn your shipmates trust and confidence. Don't dick them over. Easier said than done, but just don't. It's hard to ever go back after shit goes down like that. I came here as a first class and I'm the one that fights to get guys out of work, the one that makes sure everyone gets enough sleep and rest, I do what I can but can't win them all. Know you can't win all your battles but fight for your guys.   End corniness"
navy,3aub2i,TheBeneGesseritWitch,3,Tue Jun 23 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"So, I would strongly recommend This Is Your Ship by Captain Abrashoff. Here's a short summary if you don't want to read it...but it's an easy quick read. This book made me so upset that I never had a Captain like him before.  I think showing that you want to be there and are motivated is contagious. If you get a small core of people around you and decide that collectively you are going to impact the command, you'd be surprised what you can accomplish. You only need a few to get onboard with you, and BAM!    I think the biggest thing for me is communication. Knowing the schedule, knowing changes to the schedule, knowing expectations....just why more Captains don't use the 1MC is beyond me. I've had two that were always on that thing, and the atmosphere in the command was great. If I know what you want my division to do, we'll do it. But you gotta communicate that to me effectively. You also gotta allow me to communicate to you issues we're having. Communication is the basis, IMO, of a lot of problems that could be easily avoided."
navy,3aub2i,00cosgrovep,2,Wed Jun 24 00:58:35 2015 UTC,"That's a very important point. Knowing expectations is one of the things I've struggled with for the last ten years that I've been in. There are too many supervisors in the Navy that don't understand that they actually need to tell their people what needs to be done and how they want it done...if they want it done a certain way. It seems that too many people seem to take Patton literally, giving out indirect orders, but expecting that their people will just know how things ""need"" to be done.  As an LPO and a supervisor, I've stressed upon myself and the people that I've worked for that clarity of communication both directions is important. Whenever I had the chance (whether it was at work or off the clock), I spent time with my guys to get the gist of what they were thinking. If they had problems, they knew they could come to me. Going the other direction, you'd be surprised how many people that wear bars never considered that their instructions weren't clear enough to be executed properly.  I've got It's Your Ship on order from Amazon now, I'll read it over the next couple weeks before I show up for day one. Thanks for the recommendation, I'm sure it'll help me in this job or the next. And thanks for reminding me to make communication my number one goal."

There is a timeline that you have to get in standards by (or you can only be out of standards for a year if that makes any sense?) They also have monthly weigh ins that once they are in standards they can get weighed in and get back into the mix.   Those types of things would benefit people better. The fact that our fitness test is all or nothing is what makes people do crazy things to get in standards.

Dropping somebody into that qual program, in addition to all of the systemic teething problems a command/sailor is going to deal with during this transitory period, is just asking for problems."
navy,3asimy,No-Coast-Punk,4,Tue Jun 23 06:11:08 2015 UTC,"I read the message back in January (I think?) that said they'd start screening females in prototype. Rather than converting, they'll be sent straight to a boat from school.   The message didn't say much else, but I just left at the beginning of this month, and they'd already started having people go to the CCC to start filling out the request packages. I'll put out some feelers to my friends up there to see if they know anything else."
navy,3asimy,floppybutton,3,Tue Jun 23 14:33:43 2015 UTC,"Plan is to send SPUs, graduates, and (I think) sea returnees from the MTS's. They are going heavy on SPUs. This is typical - at prototype you are under direct NR control do they can screen you.  Would not be shocked if there was a graded in plant evolution by NRRO, but that's a guess."
navy,3asimy,looktowindward,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:44:07 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy to see some SPUs out in the fleet, most of the ones I worked with were really good. Any word on whether it's just Charleston, or is Ballston Spa included? MARF withstanding, they've got a more up-to-date training platform up there.  I'm not sure what NRRO would be able to evaluate that STG couldn't, though. That would visibly remove them from the ""supervisory oversight"" position they claim to maintain as well (though anyone who's served at NPTU knows the truth behind that).   Having a screening process for just the women is insulting to them and the community as a whole. There's plenty of turds that make it out onto a boat just because they're male. Why should a female have to impress someone to get the same job?  /soapbox"
navy,3asimy,floppybutton,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with anything you said.   There are certain technical differences, largely related to the volume of things that impacts certain procedures. I'm betting they want to make sure the female surface nukes have that on lock, especially sea returnees from carriers.   Going sub to surface isn't crazy in nuke land, but you spend time in the carriers RT div to teach you the differences. It's a well travelled path especially by LDOs. But when was the last time someone went surface to sub? And boats have no RT."

navy,3arvch,TheBeneGesseritWitch,11,Tue Jun 23 00:31:48 2015 UTC,"I spoke at length with my junior sailors who attended the E5 and Below All Hands Call with MCPON and they all brought up the same concerns.   Apparently our frustrations with the proposed BAH are fleet-wide.  I was a little disappointed the article left out some of the other questions asked at our All Hands, particularly   Why hasn't the Navy issued a ""this is how to protect yourself after the last hacking incident"" Why is Community Bank allowed to be on our bases when they were caught violating the Service-members Civil Relief Act."
navy,3arvch,No-Coast-Punk,4,Tue Jun 23 00:44:37 2015 UTC,"1) Because all of the 10'th fleet types are currently working bajillion hour days and scrambling to deal with the leak itself. Imagine the enormous FLAILEX you see Naval leadership do over small shit. This is HUGE. People are moving so fast to cover their asses, somebody involved in this shit show will probably invent faster than light travel before all the dust settles.   This is pretty much what happens when you open the CTN/IT rate to a bunch of fucking brain donor doofuses that couldn't hack it in their old rates. ""Oh, you were too fucking stupid to advance as a PS? How about you do a positive career move and join a community that deals with things too complicated for 94% of the general public to understand. You won't be able to do a single useful fucking thing other than yell at your productive sailors about uniform hits and GMT's, but come right over. The advancement is GREAT!""  Per my department head, I am no longer allowed on the phone with ANYBODY from cyber forces. Apparently making a worthless fucking first class on the other end of the phone cry in the middle of the work day is not acceptable.  The useful people over there don't really have the time or resources to put out yet another training program that 98% of the fleet will just totally ignore.  In all reality, standard identity theft protection is about all anybody can do. They aren't going to re-issue new SSN's to all of us with clearances, so it's all going to come down to being proactive about monitoring typical identity theft type vulnerabilities. USAA has a pretty good service for this, but it costs a tiny bit of money. I was signed up for it years ago as a matter of course.  2) It is probably a contractual thing. The only thing the Navy sucks at more than ensuring the well being of its people, is negotiating contracts. It wouldn't surprise me if the Navy completely forgot to include a ""You get kicked the fuck off our installations if you get caught in scummy business practices"" clause when they negotiated these contracts."

Let me show you how it goes.   The problem appears. He is no longer a person if there is any record, official mention, or even common knowledge that he has an anger issue. He is a problem. A liability to anyone who can be held accountable for his actions. Chief's problem. Chief knows this. He know that if anything goes wrong it is his ass and he will be held accountable for a leadership failure. Chief needs a proactive CYA policy and make it someone else's problem. He sets our boy up for a psych eval. Boom. No longer his problem. Anything goes wrong he can say, ""I referred him to the mental health experts, what else could I do?"" Psych's problem. Doctors are notoriously skilled at CYA documentation. Ask anyone who has had to dig through medical records and find truth. They cover liability at the expense of their patients all the time. I can give you some examples I've personally seen if your curious. Psych detects even the slightest notion (.001% chance) that our buddy /u/bircher might snap one day and use his neighbor/girl/shipmate as a pinata. Those little chances add up to a good likelihood if psych lets too many guys by undiagnosed. Now it is the psych's problem if anything goes wrong. She looks negligent having given him a pat on the back and sending the dangerous madman on his way. Better to diagnose him with something minor but meaningful, somewhat ambiguous. Difficult to prove or disprove. Something that will end a career but keep psych's liability covered. Anything goes wrong psych says ""I tried to warn everyone. I diagnosed a serious condition."" Command's problem. One of their sailor's is diagnosed with a mental condition. A ""dangerous"" one. Can't have that. If their is an incident, Chief will point to the psych, psych will point up the ladder. Liability rolls up hill if the underlings are smart about it. Better to quietly pack up his stuff and process him out. Can't have a trail of liability leading between the problem child and the top dog.   Everyone is happy except for our guy.

But I think it's interesting that each of your scenarios turns on ""if something goes wrong,"" when the whole point of the system is to make sure nothing goes wrong by getting the person help before ""something happens."" Would it be better if everybody just ignored a potential issue and hoped for the best that nothing would happen? While I understand you see people ""burned"" by this process because yes, sometimes it can result in some adverse administrative action, the whole point is to ensure the safety of the individual and other servicemembers. Nobody is sending this guy/girl to get an evaluation because the rate is overmanned, if you think leadership doesn't care about person's well-being then I can guarantee nobody gives enough of a shit about advancement quotas to do that."

navy,3ar17s,Likely_not_Eric,6,Mon Jun 22 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Spalling. Look it up. Shit's nasty. People hiding behind armor plating often get killed by spalling more than the actual rounds directed at them.  Soviet DShK's and KPV's are cheap as shit and available to anyone who can throw together a few goats as a down payment.  If I'm taking incoming fire from 12.7mmx108 and 14.5x114 rounds, I would MUCH rather be behind sand bags than any sort of armor plating that is placed on crew served mounts.   Modern ship armor is thin as shit. Low weight and maneuverability are more important in the days of radar guided missiles tipped with a metric fuckton of high explosives. You aren't going to be able to survive the damage from any modern munition, so it's best to just avoid it entirely.  Think of it like playing pool.  You have to blast something behind a fresh rack.  Do you want a shitty loose rack? Or a super tight rack?  The super tight rack is like steel.  The super loose rack is like a sand bag.  Which rack is going to send balls bouncing all over the table? Which one is going to contain everything into a muddled mess?  The round burns up a TON of energy in all of those thousands of tiny little collisions. All of that aggregate can also absorb any fragments that develop. Sand bags may be super old school tech, and bulky, and heavy as fuck, and labor intensive, and people will bitch and moan about filling/moving them.   When given the choice between being shot at behind sand bags, and even the main hull plating of ANY modern ship, I will be out there with my shovel filling sand bags 10 times out of 10.  Whomever decided to put their sailors behind sandbags is a smart motherfucker, and I would happily follow them into harms way any day of the week.  It's also why so much R&D has gone into developing all of these crazy bunker busting munitions and what not. From a sheer physics standpoint, it's pretty tough to bust through good old fashioned dirt.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_yWkA5GwM0  There is a lot of research going into getting aggregate armors into a lighter and more manageable package, as it's only real drawback is the weight. Hard armors just aren't worth a fuck until you start getting into absurd thicknesses. Those ballistic plates you have in front of your .50's are for show only. Shitty steel core AK ammo will cut through a shocking amount of plate steel. Bringing some of the big boys into the equation is even worse."

navy,3arzt0,riverine17,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:04:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, all of your questions depend on what type of command you're at. It's all depending on what you're interested in. Personally, I enjoyed the commands where I got to do LE work as opposed to ATFP. Even more so than that, I really enjoyed being within NECC, RIVRON and MESD. I've never done PRP so I can't comment on that. I went to as many schools as I could so I could open up my opportunities, I didn't much care for standing gate or weapon watches, that was the worst part for me. I preferred MA commands that did a little bit of everything, like gate, patrol, harbor, flight line... That was the best to me because I could rotate and not be so bored with the same job."
navy,3arzt0,LaserSailor760,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:24:57 2015 UTC,Thank you MA1 I understand that things are different between every command. I want to do everything possible I like both LE and ATFP aspects of it. I really appreciate your input

navy,3arzt0,Findol,2,Tue Jun 23 12:05:21 2015 UTC,"Here's an actual answer for you:  MA has some opportunities for some really cool jobs, I specialized in harbor patrol and did that for the majority of my service. I got some advanced certifications in boat handling and tactics and just had a blast driving a fast patrol boat around beautiful locations like Guam and GTMO.   There are other opportunities, the law enforcement on base is a fun gig, it's not exactly like being a civilian cop. Service members generally follow the orders of an MA so you'll only rarely actually have to fight someone. But crime does exist on base, I've made arrests for everything from DUI to Rape. It's some decent experience of you want to transition to civilian LE, just remember the civilian LE is a lot dirtier and more dangerous. There aren't a lot of third strike felons or crazy violent methheads on base.    If law enforcement isn't your style, then fleet protection offers some cool jobs. There are units that draw heavily from the MA rate in order to protect ships and other assets in foreign ports. These guys train heavily in small craft operations, access control and small unit tactics. When a ship has to visit a less than friendly port they deploy both on the ship, and in boats around it to prevent another incident like the USS Cole. A pretty cool job.   Navy dog handlers are almost exclusively MAs, it's a pretty cool job. Many act as K-9 units for base police, but others deploy to combat zones to help look for IEDs. More than one MA has become a combat causality in this role so it's not something to take lightly.   There are other paths you can take that I'm less familiar with, protective details (basically bodyguarding Navy VIPs), investigations, and such forth.   MA is a pretty sweet rating, enjoy the ride, I know I did.   And don't forget to salute the blue stickers at the gate, the officer's wives can be snotty about it. : /"

NAM: At my command, these were almost given out like candy when you separated unless you were a real shitbag.  ESWS: Not a ribbon, but in the same vein. Yeah, I worked for it, but the whole change in policy and having the command pressure people to get it felt like it robbed it of its importance. It just became another check-in-a-box kind of deal.  The rest of it was pretty much being on a command at or being enlisted in the right place and time. My god did my summer dress uniform look sad as an E1 and E2 with just the National Defense ribbon while at my training command.

If we had the manning to constantly run 4 watch sections, then we would have been doing it all along! (despite the non-circadian nature, 5&15 is also a massive improvement over 5&10). My department had to run the watchbill ragged, with basically no spare personnel, and almost nobody free to do ""night-only"" maintenance items that can't be executed during flight operations. In fact, several divisions had to specifically alter their PMS boards to make the study possible at all. After the NPS folks left, said divisions were run into the ground in order to catch back up.

navy,3aimyq,PawnKiller,24,Sun Jun 21 08:10:33 2015 UTC,"Sailors need more sleep and shorter watches.  That's the unequivocal demand from Navy scientists and safety officials, who claim many sailors operate well below acceptable levels, and point to costly mishaps where lack of sleep has contributed. There's also evidence that adverse sleep patterns contribute to mental health issues and sleep disorders.  Experts have called for a number of changes, to include an end to five-and-dime watch bills (five hours on, 10 hours off), modifications to meal and meeting times, and elimination of disruptions in berthing areas. But change hasn't come easy. Many leaders see the call for more and better sleep as impractical without more sailors or a reduction in the work load. And old school leaders still see it as a weakness.  Those are the attitudes that the service's sleep advocates are tirelessly fighting, so they are arming fleet leaders with new gouge and best practices to promote more alert watchstanders.  ""There is a great amount of science that has looked at the effect of sleep deprivation, but the military as a whole has not fully embraced the findings,"" said retired Capt. John Cordle, who has commanded two ships. ""The question is, how to educate commanders on the science of sleep and get it in terms that they can relate to, specifically operational readiness.""  Badge of honor  A sailor found drunk on duty will be disciplined or even booted out. But countless sailors are standing watch with an equivalent impairment every day. Studies show 22 hours without sleep is equivalent to a blood-alcohol content of 0.08.  Still, ""the operational community treats the need for sleep as a resource to be rationed in the best times, and as a sign of weakness in the worst,"" where a sailor's ability to perform with no sleep is prized as a ""badge of honor.""  Such were the findings of an independent, two-year study by the Rand Corp. titled ""Sleep in the Military: Promoting Healthy Sleep Among U.S. Servicemembers."" Completed in April, it is the first comprehensive review of sleep-related policies and realities throughout the Defense Department. The results are telling — ""Sleep problems are prevalent, debilitating and persistent in servicemember populations.""  More than one-third of service members get the recommended seven hours or more of sleep; three out of 10 get five hours or less, an insufficiency linked with ""significantly increased morbidity and mortality."" One-third of sailors feel tired, fatigued, or not up to par one to two times a week, and 16 percent feel that way every day.  Lack of sleep impairs reaction time, attention, memory, and reasoning, according to the report. Those with insufficient sleep are more likely to have a high body-mass index, poor nutrition, and fail to meet fitness standards.  Problems don't end when the deployment ends. One in five sailors who returned from deployment said sleep problems still interfere with work or daily tasks ""somewhat to very much.""  ""We are actually causing injury, causing people to experience sleep disorders when we expose them to all these patterns,"" said Nita Shattuck, an associate professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who has studied the effects of fatigue and sleep deprivation for more than 13 years.  The Rand study also found that soldiers who averaged less than six hours of sleep while deployed were more than three times more likely to attempt suicide than those with more adequate sleep, and sleep problems can contribute to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and traumatic brain injury.  Fixing sleep  Officials said the surface Navy could learn a lot from its aviation brethren. Rules that govern the sleep habits of pilots and air crews are far more rigid.  While no one plan can fit all situations, the Naval Postgraduate School recommends the 3/9 circadian watch bill become the norm whenever possible; this four-section rotation allows sailors to stand watch and sleep at the same times daily. Though it means more watch turnovers, the shorter watches (and better sleep) will sharpen individual focus and provide sailors stability and predictability.  Experts continue to gather evidence that circadian watchbills boost performance. Sailors' reaction time was 13 percent faster and errors were cut by one-third when they stood a 3/9 watch as compared to a five-and-dime, according to an NPS study on the carrier Nimitz that wrapped up in June.  Providing more time to sleep is only half the problem. Weary sailors often contend with noise and uncomfortable racks. Inconsistent sleep patterns exacerbate the problem. Other recommendations include:   Better schedules. Schedule routine meetings and division quarters between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Extend meal times to accommodate watch turnovers. Ensure that sailors have the chance to sleep at the same time daily, following a 24-hour rhythm. Reduce noise. Arrange berthing by watch section to keep a lid on noise and nuisance during sleep times. Provide better mattresses and curtains that shut out light. Eliminate non-emergency announcements in off-duty berthing.   If you don't have enough people to man the four-section watch required for the 3/9, man a three-section — but ditch the five-and-dime, Shattuck said. A four-and-eight watch bill will bring more stability and better performance. If it does not provide a long enough period of adequate sleep, get a good nap. Don't ask the body to do something it is not designed to do, or there will be unavoidable consequences.  ""I think changes are occurring, and that is very encouraging,"" Shattuck said. ""The idea of having crew rest policies for surface ships is going to change the Navy in some fundamental ways. It is going to improve morale and performance.""  The hardest time  The Rand report found that senior military personnel may have an exceedingly difficult time prioritizing sleep; analysis suggests commanders may be the most sleep-deprived servicemembers.  This comes as no surprise to Cordle. The former commander of destroyer Oscar Austin and cruiser San Jacinto, defined a close call as 30 feet or 30 seconds from a collision or grounding, and said there were four times in his career he put himself in that situation.  ""In three of them, I was tired,"" said Cordle, who now serves as technical director of AMSEC's Maintenance University.  The closest call came during an eight-hour transit of the Kattegat passage between Denmark and Sweden in 2001. Cordle's destroyer led a four-ship column through the dark night, and he had been up all day. On the bridge for situational awareness, he was dozing off while standing up. Sudden commotion snapped him out of it, and the tired skipper quickly realized the ship's crew had lost track of its position.  ""It was pretty clear that the watch team really didn't know where the ship was,"" he said. ""Going through a very narrow transit at 2 o'clock in the morning, at about 15 to 20 knots, and there's other ships 2,000 yards behind you, that's a bad time to lose situational awareness.""  Cordle took the conn, got a good plot from the navigator and was able to recover, but had to drop formation to do so.  ""I got a pretty good butt chewing from the commodore after it, but the reality was I let myself get so tired that I lost situational awareness,"" Cordle recalled. ""When the crew turned to me to make a decision, I wasn't prepared to make it. That really bugged me for the rest of my tour on Oscar Austin.""  Cordle turned those lessons learned into a passionate pursuit for change. He dug into medical reviews, studied the body's circadian rhythm, and soon promoted three-on, nine-off watch bills built around four watch teams rotating through a 24-hour day.  ""You can have the greatest warship in the world, but if the crew is fatigued and is not operating at peak performance, you are doing yourself no favors,"" he said.  Cordle's commitment caught the attention of a young mustang serving on the commander's action group. He would later become the executive officer of destroyer Barry and, at the onset of a nine-month pump, presented the idea to the skipper, who gave him the thumbs-up.  ""We noticed an immediate impact on crew morale and our [maintenance and material management] got better,"" said Cmdr. Pat Foster, who now commands the Barry. ""The hardest time was getting through some traditional thinkers and breaking paradigms, mainly in the chief's mess. After a few weeks, they came around. From that point, we never received one negative comment from khakis or the deck plate. And I can't count the number of [positive] comments I got. That is about as clear as it gets to me.""  Foster knows the pain of sleepless service. He did five years of five-and-dime watches as a chief on sea duty in Japan. As a second-class operations specialist in the first Gulf War, he spent six straight months in port-and-starboard watch — six hours on, six hours off.  ""We only had three days liberty in Dubai that deployment. Everything else was at sea. It was absolutely brutal,"" he said. ""I distinctly remember many, many days thinking, 'Do I want to eat or just go to sleep?' If you eat, you are going to wait in line. There was never a line at the chili bar, so I ate chili a lot just so I could go to sleep. I didn't eat chili again for 15 years after that deployment.""  Despite its benefits, the circadian watch bill takes careful planning and preparation at every watch station, Foster said. Everyone must be certified to man a four-section watch. On Barry, there were ""a small number"" of jobs — crypto-technicians and electronic warfare folks — who could not participate because they lacked the numbers of qualified personnel.  If Foster has the opportunity to return to command, would he take the time to implement a circadian watch bill once more?  ""Unequivocally, yes,"" he said."

Those Sailors driving keeping these platforms moving are doing so in support of any number of intelligence objectives every day. Everyone has their piece in the puzzle to play. If intel source rates are qualifying IDW on a carrier as well as SW/AW, there's no reason why a BM couldn't do the reverse. Whether you like it or not, these Sailors are helping us accomplish our mission and deserve a shot just like we do (when appropriately deployed in support of sea-going/expeditionary platforms)."
navy,3ahfig,freshdolphin,2,Sun Jun 21 01:05:22 2015 UTC,"I get that, but we have to acknowledge that some CT rates don't get to deploy all that ofen, though very shortly that will change. There is also concern of how will the classifies portions be handled?"
navy,3ahfig,whiterhino1982,2,Sun Jun 21 02:22:08 2015 UTC,"The opportunity is there just not always for first termers. Thankfully CTNs are seeing more options and all other Intel rates can deploy regularly in the right billet. We stripped the classified portions down without compromising the pin's ""integrity"" to accommodate unclass support at the NIOC. I'm sure it will be just as easy to do so at other commands."
navy,3ahfig,freshdolphin,2,Sun Jun 21 03:22:56 2015 UTC,"Ya, CTN'S are opening up which is really awesome, and I'm glad to hear that we found a way of handling the classified side without hurting the pin itself, but I know most ""fleet CT's"" see it as a waste of time anyway because they have surface or air or whatever, but when it is the only pin you may ever have the chance to get and worked hard for it you don't want to see it watered down and be passed up in eval situations because someone at your command went on a deployment got Air, Sea and IDW all in one go when the chance wasn't there for everyone."
navy,3ahfig,whiterhino1982,2,Sun Jun 21 04:29:43 2015 UTC,"Those ""fleet CTs"" are still required to get it regardless of their attitude towards it. Most commands will only rate sea vs sea and shore vs shore sailors for eval purposes so you won't be getting the short end of the stick. The fleet CTs refusing to qualify IDW will be scrutinized come time to promote to Chief while you'll be sitting fully qualified for the board."
navy,3ahfig,freshdolphin,2,Sun Jun 21 15:23:13 2015 UTC,"Except that the CT or IS or whatever in your scenario are able to actually see and/or take part in all or most of the aspects of a SW/AW/EXW etc pin. A BM can't just go down to the SSES and see how that stuff works or whatever.   I'm all for rates that don't necessarily do the job being able to qualify for different pins if they are willing to put in the work- hell, if I weren't then as a CT I'd never get anything but IDW. My issue though is how does someone in a job without the appropriate clearances get that pin when a large part of the PQS is TS/SCI?"
navy,3ahfig,crnelson10,2,Sun Jun 21 13:54:48 2015 UTC,"""Most"" aspects. A lot of stuff gets waived for riders due to the assumption of the platform that they are already qualified senior-in-rate for at-sea/ashore watch stations. Do you think 'ol Boats is excited to see his pin doled out to Sailors who've never participated in unreps/maintenance/watchstanding? It goes both ways. You're not always going to get balls deep in every pin and understand every system. Hell, shore CTs don't even get to physically interact with any measure of equipment so what's your argument there? The concepts and functions of SSES and other rates can be explained in an unclassified manner just like we did for Sailors supporting my last command regarding the functions of certain offices. The first two books are unclassified for a reason. It's on the command to keep it that way for the command specific book or to create an unclassified version for non-source rates."
navy,3ahfig,freshdolphin,2,Sun Jun 21 15:16:21 2015 UTC,"shore CTs don't even get to physically interact with any measure of equipment so what's your argument there?   My argument there is that that statement is false. As a rider who gets farmed out to other shops ashore, my job isn't any different in either setting except it's harder to walk in one of them.    Do you think 'ol Boats is excited to see his pin doled out to Sailors who've never participated in unreps/maintenance/watchstanding?   I've never had the opportunity to attempt another pin, so I can't speak to this personally. Everyone I know who has had to at least take a small part in unreps and watchstanding."
navy,3ahfig,crnelson10,2,Sun Jun 21 16:41:13 2015 UTC,"As a rider you get the opportunity to but those on shore duty and many CTNs will never interact with collection/Intel systems, they qualify on theory rather than practical application. Many riders don't participate in watch standing outside their job duties and subs/air have the added benefit of staying out in hotels/collecting per diem while in port instead of being part of a duty section."
navy,3ahfig,freshdolphin,2,Sun Jun 21 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"will never interact with collection/Intel systems,   I'm DIRSUP, and I'm EIDWS quald. I'm telling you right now that the only things in that PQS that I've never personally used are some of the CCOP gear on platforms I haven't been on. For everything else I've at least had training on.    Many riders don't participate in watch standing outside their job duties   That's their choice, and if there is a pin available to them and they don't partake in those things, I'd fully expect the ship's crew to not sign them off for those items.    subs/air have the added benefit of staying out in hotels/collecting per diem while in port instead of being part of a duty section.   I don't know what your point here is and I can't speak for the sub guys, but air CTs don't go to ships so they are never ""in port"" and every surface deployment I've been on I've stood watches in port."
navy,3ahfig,crnelson10,2,Sun Jun 21 17:59:40 2015 UTC,"My point exactly, you're dirsup and interface with some of the equipment. When I qualified IDW, I and many others like myself had never set foot on any sea-going platform, seen any collection/intel equipment, and qualified entirely on theory. While you may expect a crew to not sign off on things, it happens for riders every day across all platforms. I meant those attached to aviation squadrons on carriers, not the aircrew folks as all those mother fuckers live the good life on deployment. Were you assigned to a DC locker? Did you perform maintenance and tagouts? OOD/POOW? You likely sat in the ice box behind the black door. My point is, your qual experience as a rider IS different than your permanent party counter parts, just like their qual experience for IDW would be different than yours."
navy,3ahfig,freshdolphin,2,Sun Jun 21 18:18:43 2015 UTC,"So everyone thinks that book 2 is unclasified. There is a big deal of a Sailor at my command who was taking notes about some of the tools mentioned in there and when you went to that tools Web page the description was clearly classified as Secret, meaning his books can't leave and he has take classified material out. Simply describing what some of these tools do is a classified thing."
navy,3ahfig,whiterhino1982,2,Mon Jun 22 21:17:57 2015 UTC,The books themselves are unclassified. It isn't necessary to explain every tool for a sailor without a clearance to understand the core of what information dominance warfare is about. Much like how you don't need to know the procedures of an underway ELT outside of the gist that he is responsible for reactor chemistry and where the sample sinks are.
navy,3ahfig,freshdolphin,2,Mon Jun 22 21:54:02 2015 UTC,TS/SCI?  I did three PQS for IDW at SOUTHCOM and it was not above SECRET. Pretty sure ONI is the same.

navy,3ag5sm,A_Freaking_Bear,17,Fri Jun 19 21:43:00 2015 UTC,it's really command dependent. some let you have a flashlight or knife on the belt. others none. if you use the tool everyday go for it but don't have a batman belt.

navy,3ag5sm,OldVCR,6,Sat Jun 20 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"Don't take this as an instruction, but how I understand it is if you need the tool, it's tolerated.

navy,3ag5sm,faustrex,2,Fri Jun 19 21:51:30 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, it's definitely just a multitool, and I work with enough hardware everyday that it is legitimately useful. It would just be better to put it on my belt than in my pocket all the time in order to keep better track of it."

Wearing breast insignias of different finishes (i.e., anodized and oxidized) is prohibited.   This is interesting as there is no mention of gold insignia, but that mixing of finishes is no good.

""Pro-military"" in US political speak equates to supporting spending on military contracts so essentially they are ""Pro-Military-Industrial-Complex"".   Look at the contracts and programs that often get approved at the senate level, if you watch CSPAN you can sometimes catch some of the senate hearings where the respective heads of service from the Pentagon and their representatives will say ""we don't need or want program X it is a waste of money"" and yet politicians will continue spending because it brings money back to their respective districts/states.  I don't vote one branch or the other, I vote for the best candidate so I'm as anti-republican as I am anti-democrat in this bipartisan government.  With regards to McCain not supporting the 9/11 GI Bill, he actually never voted on it. He was running for President, spoke out against the bill on the floor and proposed we get a raise I think of like 5000 in the Montgomery GI Bill. He got a lot of flack for it and when it came time to vote rather than vote no he skipped it.  The 9/11 GI Bill is probably the single greatest improvement in QOL that I have seen in my 20+ career and that guy fought for me to not have it so I know where my vote went.  TLDR McCain was against the 9/11 GI Bill, Republicans/politicians aren't pro people they're pro capitalism."

navy,3aebnw,BurningBushes2000,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:19:28 2015 UTC,"Because those ""increases"" weren't anything more than meant to keep up with the inflating cost of college education and to be honest it wasn't helping a whole lot. When I joined in the early 90's the GI Bill would have covered most if not all of a 4 year degree, some states were supplementing the bill as well.   The Navy also instituted a ""college fund"" as a signing bonus that ran separate of the GI Bill to help cover the remaining cost of school, but that was hit & miss if you were offered it.  By the time the 9/11 GI Bill was proposed the Montgomery GI Bill was only going to cover about 2.5-3yrs at many institutions which was never the intention of the bill.   The purpose of the GI Bill was to provide an opportunity for service members to get a full education after there service. Clintons raise & Bushes raise helped the Montgomery bill go a little further but it was still woefully inadequate in comparison to the GI Bill in its early years."
navy,3aebnw,BlackSquirrel05,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:43:22 2015 UTC,"Very true. The GI Bill was the greatest. It helped pay for my undergraduate and graduate degree. I wouldn't be where I am today without it.   Easy for McCain to vote no on it when he went to USNA because his dad was a 4 star and his grandpa was a 4 star and his son also got into the academy (to be fair his son is a cool guy, met him a few times). But for normal people who don't have legacy admission into the boat school we need help with funding college.

You will need to get a waiver and you are only waiverable after a certain amount of time (6 months I believe) I.E you can't get surgery one day and hop in the doctors chair the next.

I will be graduating with a BS in Mechanical Engineering in the Spring so I'm guessing OCS would be my path but can I take tests etc. to see if I qualify before ever joining or does that all happen once I'm in?
navy,3aeg8y,whatsdup,2,Fri Jun 19 13:58:39 2015 UTC,"I believe the OCS route actually requires that you get accepted to your job before you go. Still not positive, but you can definitely take he ASTB, or at least some practice tests. You might as well start talking to a recruiter as well, they'd be able to answer those questions for sure.   Its probably good you arent NROTC, though. Mechanical engineers are notorious for being selected for nuke regardless of their choices"
navy,3aeg8y,swotivator2014,2,Fri Jun 19 14:17:36 2015 UTC,"To me, you will obviously be going to OCS so find an officer recruiter not an enlisting recruiter. They will help set you up to take the  ASTB-E exam which proves you can do basic math, understand a paragraph when you finish it, know some minor mechanical information, and be familiar with basic nautical/aviation terminology. I took it, it was not difficult.  You're scores should be above average if you're holding at least a 3.0 in a mechanical engineering program..Then your recruiter will set you up for a meeting. You tell him your life story and wait for paperwork to be completed/submitted. (do not procrastinate)   The sooner you speak with a local recruiter, the clearer this picture will become for you. That's what happened for me. Good luck future competition."
navy,3aeg8y,RagingTeddy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:59:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, OCS is your path. Do your research and get all your prerequisites ready before you even apply. You can definitely talk to an officer recruiter to get some information but don't think they'll just sign you up on the spot. You have to know what you need to qualify for before you join or else you'll just be relying on dumb luck. I knew a guy who went to OCS and didn't put a preference down because he thought he would just get SWO. SWO is not a hard community to get into but he got supply corps. He was an idiot. Don't expect that it'll just ""all happen"" once you're in. It's like saying ""will Harvard let me know about SAT scores and extra-curriculars once I get in?"" You probably won't even get in if you don't know what's going on.  Even if you make it through primary flight training, you might also end up flying an aircraft you didn't want, etc. I wouldn't recommend the military if you don't want to get stuck doing something else you didn't want to do because that's like 90% of the job."

I went through OCS, didn't need a waiver (for vision, at least), and have had no problems.  That said, if you want the surgery, do it before joining.  I wanted it and figured I'd just get it on the Navy's dime after I joined, but apparently my eyesight is not ""bad enough"" to get it.  All the guys here saying you shouldn't only want to be a pilot because serve your country rah rah are not wrong, but they are assholes.  The guys touting needs of the Navy are worse.  Why should you give a shit about the needs of the Navy if you're not even in the Navy?  Let's be honest, if I'd been turned down for pilot and told ""SWO or go,"" I wouldn't be in the Navy right now.  There are so many ways to serve besides the Navy.  If the Navy doesn't have any that appeal to you, go somewhere else (and I don't necessarily mean a different branch, either).  I personally knew at least 4 guys who got all or most of the way through OCS before they found out NAMI turned them down for pilot.  One of them pickup up NFO, one went IT or something, one guy just got out, and one guy really wanted to be a Naval Officer and applied for SWO, etc, but wasn't accepted, so he got out.  Nobody judged any of them."
navy,3aeg8y,Force_USN,3,Fri Jun 19 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"I am one of those guys that you mentioned as an ""asshole"", which is unnecessary. No need to name call others for pointing out something important to people that are thinking about going in.   I was not touting the needs of the Navy, so much as explaining that the Navy has needs. There is a difference. Not everybody interested in the military understands how tentative the system can be.  Anyone interested in joining the Navy should know the Navy has needs, and sometimes things don't work out. So when Joe Schmoe says he doesn't want to get stuck doing something else in the military- it is therefore important to make note to him that the system doesn't give a fuck about what he doesn't want to get stuck doing. That's why the needs of the Navy are important to an outsider. Not the needs themselves- but the fact that the needs are very real, and things don't always work out. So when someone whines about doing something they don't want to do- that's tough shit. That's the way the system works.   It has nothing to do with being judged. It's just to convey to potential people joining that you'd best get used to the idea of not necessarily getting what you want. So when they say something like ""I would only want to fly""- it's is important to let them know that might not happen.  With that said I'm not discouraging this gentleman from joining entirely. It just makes sense not to join if you refuse the idea of serving in any other manner-  because then it becomes a gamble. I'm just telling him to get comfortable with the system and the idea that country comes first- for his sake. I'm not judging him for only wanting to be a pilot. Am I crusty? Sure. But I'm not an asshole for telling someone not to complain about doing something else in the Navy. It's the way it works."

The reason I took issue with what you guys were saying is because the tone of some commenters made it sound like he should feel guilty for wanting to join just to fly, which I disagree with.  I also think it's misleading to say that he could join and get forced into doing something other than flying.  Like I mentioned, I know guys who got turned down by NAMI, and they had the option of going to another community or getting out.  Same goes for a few guys I've met who attrited(sp?) from primary.

It's just aggravating to read people say they don't want to do anything else but fly- because there's a million and one other ways to fly aircraft than joining the military. The military just isn't the place to be demanding about what you want to do. As much as I wish you could.

We were also on USS CHAMPION, but rotated to SENTRY where we took over for Crew Bulwark.  It's confusing at first, but eventually you get the hang of it."

You shouldn't come at him aggressively.  An option could be to have him see you actively coming and going to the gym.  If you two are friends then it would be even more effective that you share interests.  Once you get deployed you will see a lot of people going to the gym. Many people jump on the bandwagon to do the same thing just because they see people doing it. You could have some of your friends coming over regularly, at times you know he'll be there, and go workout or run. He may possibly decide to want to join you, even more so if you're going right after you two have been hanging out.  If he does ever go with you do not try to intimidate him with too difficult of a workout. And if he ends up never wanting to go, then there's not much else you can do about it. I suggest you keep your attitude on trying to help out shipmates where they need it. And to also look for ways to improve yourself as well and accept constructive criticism.  Always remember that you're not better than anyone else, even if it says you are on paper. Keep it up!"
navy,3a7w07,devildocjames,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:42:50 2015 UTC,"For now, I deny him whenever he tries to borrow my truck to go to McDonalds or Taco Bell. I have offered for him a few times to go the gym but our schedules are quite different because I work night shift(12 hours, 3 on, 1 off) and he works admin hours (7-16 mon-fri). One of my friends who lives across from us asked him the other day if he wants to go for a run and my roommate replied ""I don't do cardio"". Bitch, you don't do anything. But thats beside the point, the same friend asked him if he wanted to go the gym a few days before and my roommate turned him down. When he goes to the gym, all he does is arms and then sit in sauna.   I don't know how he got like this either. He's 8404 and was in amazing shape when he got to this duty station from FMTB. He's just become complacent and recently got orders to the Marines and is STILL making no effort to get in shape."

Explain the physical and emotional benefits of being healthier than he is.  If you don't know them all then get with your CFL, or Google everything you can.

That C school is fuckin awesome, especially if you get the evening class because there's never any traffic coming on or off base.  The instructors are great, for part of the coursework there are civilian instructors who really know their shit.  No PT sessions, but there's a great gym right down the street.  You'll be in class for like 4 hours a day, if that.  There's no liberty policy, muster, duty, or marching in formation like A school.  When you're not in class, you can do whatever you want.  Living accommodations on base are good.  I was pulling BAH but the people in transit liked where they were staying, which for you I'm pretty sure will be the Gateway Inn, but if they're not giving you per diem, you'll be in barracks and they're not bad either.  Two to a room at most.  When you get to the base, ask for Student Admin (I think that's what it's called).  If you're coming on base from the Dam Neck Road gate, make the first right and it's a little ways down on your right.  That's where you check in and they'll set you up from there."

Or giving POA to someone who is going to abuse it.  But I've seen Senior Enlisted get burned by POA shenanigans, too.  I think taking care of that boils down more to ""intrusive"" leadership; you know paying attention to what your sailors are doing in their personal lives and at least giving them the tools they need to not screw themselves.  You can't stop stupid, but you can prevent the number of mistakes due to lack of knowledge.  A bad choice when they had the information and knew better is their fault; a bad choice because I didn't take them time to educate them is my fault.  At least that's how I see it.  I'm getting off-topic.  Totally agree, the NEX is not completely altruistic.  That said, it is NOT the exploitative type of companies that you find lurking around every major base I can think of.  Just drive around Norfolk and San Diego.  I'll run out of fingers and toes before I'm done counting the state-side dealerships that will end up charging a sailor WAY more (in total cost, including interest) on a used junker than MAS will charge on a new vehicle.    I was just saying the AD is horribly, horribly worded, but the program isn't there to sneak up and get you.

navy,3a5jb7,Maggiemayday,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:16:07 2015 UTC,Every dollar you spend is an investment. Buying a vehicle that is just a few years old as compared to a brand new car will save you thousands of dollars.    The vehicle that is a few years old will provide you the same return as the brand new vehicle. It will serve the same function.  When buying brand new you are just investing in the thrill of owning the flashiest new ford focus.  Kind of dumb.

Usually bumper to bumper for up to 5 years as well as a maintenance plan that is covered for the same amount of time.   2- Financing. This is probably the biggest. Financing for a used car will not be as good as a brand new. For a used car a few years old the best you're going to get is around 5-6 percent interest. New cars often offer financing thru the dealership at lower than inflation rates anywhere from 0-2% interest. Even with the cash to buy outright it makes no sense with interest this low. You will actually be making money with the money invested instead. Paying 20k in cash for a car when you could have financed it at a low interest rate and put that money into a brokerage account is actually the better idea.   Every dollar you spend isn't an investment. That is nonsense. Money is required to live, eat, and have fun.   Buying a car that is older and offers a higher interest rate and no warranty is never the better option. Especially if major repairs are needed on the older car.   Furthermore, older used cars can go upside down in financing much quicker than used.   TLDR- Buying new is better."
navy,3a5jb7,Maggiemayday,2,Thu Jun 18 13:34:47 2015 UTC,"1- Have you heard of certified used cars?  I never said go buy a jalopy..   2- My 2013 used Auto loan is 2%. You will be upside down on that new vehicle purchase the moment you drive it off the lot.    3- When you buy fast food as opposed to shopping for groceries and preparing a decent meal, you've just invested in a quick unhealthy return."
navy,3a5jb7,Thameus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:45:20 2015 UTC,And you're not upside down on a used car the minute you drive off the lot?   A used Tacoma that is 2 years old is 2k less than a brand new one. I'd prefer a brand new one.

He was full of shit and I knew it, but let's just say my last CoC and I didn't exactly get along. I figured they were collectively throwing me under the bus to protect someone they actually like.  After grilling me for about an hour and letting me stew and freak out alone in the interview room for another hour, he came back in and told me to go home.

navy,3a1yqc,derangedlunatech,4,Tue Jun 16 18:13:50 2015 UTC,Would someone refresh my memory (in simple terms)?  What is the difference between general and special courts-martial?
navy,3a1yqc,Bosworth2,9,Tue Jun 16 17:57:02 2015 UTC,Special Court-Martial = Bad Conduct Discharge.  General Court-Martial = Dishonorable Discharge.  GCM is worse than SPCM.
navy,3a1yqc,Kailuafornia,2,Tue Jun 16 20:58:12 2015 UTC,"Also, SPCM = 1 yr max confinement."
navy,3a1yqc,XDingoX83,-1,Wed Jun 17 23:49:14 2015 UTC,Gcm is roughly equivalent to a felony.

In Mayport, ET2 Joseph Bradley pleaded guilty to indecent visual broadcasting or distribution.

navy,3a1yqc,WanderingSailor,5,Tue Jun 16 23:38:30 2015 UTC,What do you mean? If they get court martialied and found guilty they will go to a show cause board through Bupers where they determine if they can remain on the Active Duty List of Officers. More than likely if you are found guilty you will be admin seperated.
navy,3a1yqc,Kailuafornia,3,Tue Jun 16 23:58:39 2015 UTC,If an officer ever gets in any kind of trouble that lands him or her in front of a court martial they aren't really an officer anymore. His or her career is over and they're basically taken out of the chain at their command until they're outprocessed.
navy,3a1yqc,mpyne,-3,Tue Jun 16 23:59:16 2015 UTC,Not really true.  Kicking an Officer out is much harder than it seems.
navy,3a1yqc,daimii,2,Wed Jun 17 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"Arent officers supposed to be held to a higher standard?   Yes. That's why ""conduct unbecoming"" can only be charged against officers (though there is, of course, the 'general rule' for enlisted).   If the conduct is below that standard should they still be an officer?   As always, it depends. If their conduct were below the standard and yet still above the standard we set for enlisted, does it necessarily follow the officer must be dismissed the service?  I mean, I can think of many situations where the punishment should also be much more severe than what SN Timmy might get, but I can also think of ""un-officerly"" behavior that doesn't necessarily rate dismissal."

Regardless, per Navy regulations ( OPNAVINST 6110.1J ), mandatory separation must occur for members who have failed three or more PFA failures in most recent four-year period, even if the most recent PFA was passed.

I'd bet my paycheck on her having failed the most recent one that nearly all of us took in the past couple months. She most definitely did not pass her most recent assessment. They wouldn't just let her stay for six months after she failed to make weight or her run time. You're not getting the whole story.  Either way, it's quibbling over nothing. She's out and there's really nothing that can be done about it. She may be a little ashamed and that's okay. She may just be trying to keep her pride in front of her parent. Lord knows she's probably embarrassed enough as it is. Rest assured knowing that this didn't sneak up on her and, for whatever reason, she couldn't or wouldn't get in standards.

The Nav was transitioning from being a WWIII fighting apparatus to a...well, no one knew what it would transition to.    I signed up to protect my country from the Soviet threat.  The Soviet threat was gone.  We brushed Iraq aside like a dust bunny.  We had no enemies left to fight.  I just didn't feel like I had a purpose any more.  We won.  So I got out.  No hard feelings.  I just felt like me and my Navy had done the job I set out to do, and it was time for me to get out.   Had some very productive years as a civilian, and my naval experience was priceless.  I hated sea duty while I was in.  But I won't lie and say I didn't like being at sea.  Some pretty good memories.  And I still keep in touch with some of my shipmates.

navy,39u04t,looktowindward,12,Sun Jun 14 22:39:46 2015 UTC,"Until a new uniform is ordered, the Navy must proceed as though no change is coming. That includes some improvements. For example, the Lightweight NWU will be an optional item available this fall. The prototypes weigh about one-third less and were described by sailors as ""more breathable"" and ""much cooler.""   They keep delaying this release.  I'll believe it when I see it.   Ironically, Type I NWU sales have steadily declined since 2010, when the Navy made blueberries mandatory. Annual sales started strong with roughly 280,000 pairs sold. The uniforms are supposed to last 24 months; by design, half of the 267,636 enlisted sailors on active duty — or 133,818 — should buy a new set each year.    But they issue 4 pairs in your seabag and you can rotate them out.  If they're supposed to last 24 months each, that gives you 8 years before you need new ones, unless you change size or get pregnant or something."

navy,39u04t,looktowindward,-5,Sun Jun 14 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"I checked the AF uniform regs. They do allow for fight worn off base. But, it is considered organizational clothing and only individuals in a flight status can wear them. Also you can only wear them on days you are flying. Even still think of your average sailor, do you honestly think they will keep their coverall clean and not shitty looking? Honestly there is no reason you should be wearing any uniform except a dress uniform off base. That IMO goes for all services. If you are driving to and from work that is one thing but anyone who is just posting up in them going shopping looks silly.

I was stationed in Japan my entire time in and we never were allowed to wear anything but blues, whites and the brown service uniforms off base.

navy,39uenl,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 10:39:09 2015 UTC,"Tampion:       A tampion is a wooden plug, or a metal, canvas, rubber, or plastic cover, for the muzzle of a gun. Tampions can be found on both land-based artillery and naval guns. Naval tampions have developed into works of art.  Although the cannons of ships of the line were protected as they were retracted inside the ships, many smaller vessels had exposed gundecks which required a plug to protect inside of the barrels. Later, the invention of mobile gun turrets meant that all guns were constantly exposed to water. Hence, when not in use, naval guns were protected by wooden, and, later, rubber, muzzle plugs. Typically, rubber and plastic tampions can be shot through in case of an emergency. Plastic tampions are normally designed to be expelled by the build-up of pressure in the barrel as the first shell is fired.  Over time, tampions were embossed or engraved with the arms of the unit, and they became collector's items. Nowadays, even warships that typically would not carry heavy guns, such as submarines, have their own badges in the shape of a tampion.

navy,39q3jp,faustrex,2,Sun Jun 14 17:06:20 2015 UTC,"Fraud in a civil sense maybe, I think criminally it maybe a harder case to make. Also did they ask for a discount? Do you require ID? If you gave a discount based on their attire that maybe morally wrong of them but not legally punishable. Just because they bought something wearing this does not equate to fraud.  I separated from the navy fairly recently. I do not go around wearing my old uniforms or asking for discounts. It is not something I would do or I think is right. But their right to wear what they choose maybe protected under the First Amendment. It maybe distasteful and morally wrong, but not illegal nor should it be illegal."

You will have to get all the court documents together and let your recruiter give it to the processor at MEPS. With that many charges they will most likely want it before you go to see if you're actually eligible for a waiver. You can look at the CRUITMAN and add up all your charges to see what waiver you would need.
navy,39s1o8,jayh2430,3,Sun Jun 14 11:19:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, as mentioned by the previous posters you will be eligible to join with waivers but the key thing to note is this.

I served on LSD-41 during the 1994 Cuban mass exodus and we pulled about 3000 people out of the Florida straits over the duration of Op Sea Signal. You can keep large numbers of people exclusively in the well deck and not have rescuees wandering inside the skin of the ship. We sectioned off the well deck into living, shower/sanitary areas and there was enough room to even segregate living areas for families, by gender, and have a 'trouble-maker' segregation area. Watch standers/security on the wing walls can observe everyone easily. We created a feeding station in the turntable. We could keep about 600 people for a week in the well deck .

The Essex and other ships in company are probably doing a fantastic job too, but give credit where credit is due.

navy,39lnp3,haru0001,94,Fri Jun 12 16:33:18 2015 UTC,"I hit 20 in March next year. My enlistment doesn't end until my 23rd.  Anyway, I made a career in the Navy for two reasons: 1) I was 23 and a fucking loser with no money and no future; and 2) I didn't want to be my stepdad who drank his life away, crying about ""if I'd only stayed in, I'd be retired by now.""  So, basically I waited until I couldn't take the pain of my chosen civilian life anymore to sign up for a career in the military to avoid becoming anything like my stepdad.  But here's what I've really gotten out of just about 20 years:  Don't just do 20 and get out. Anyone who tells you that is missing something.    I'm going to tell you to CONTRIBUTE to those around you whether you only do four or stay for 24.  Be a fucking legend. Be someone people will remember.   Get as many quals and as much education as you can handle. Hold other people to those same standards.  Don't just ""Do 20,"" fucking rock your goddamn career for all its worth so you're not creating a mindset in those around you to ask ""why am I always told just to do 20 and get out?""  Don't waste your time and don't let those around you feel like they are wasting theirs!  Fucking lead, follow or GTFO! Easy day.  Go inspire!"

No hard feelings... it was just not the job for me. I am glad I recognized it at that point and moved on, using what was GOOD about the military to further my career in the civilian sector."

They went directly from mom's house to boot camp.  Not that this is a terrible thing. Sometimes I wish I would've done that. But it definitely affects the skewed career advice they give junior sailors.   It also skews the other way, too......a lot of these guys love to talk about how screwed up navy leadership is, and how they can't wait to get back to the ""real world"", as if there's no such thing as an asshole manager without anchors on."

navy,39lnp3,DoobieEx,0,Sat Jun 13 01:38:14 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that both of these groups that you described enter the Navy at a young age.   Group 1 believes that no other career paths should exist except military career paths. Most join the Navy right after high school after working minimum wage jobs for shitty people.  Group 2 believes that the civilian work force is all butterflies and rainbows, and that all civilian managers are lax and happy and everyone gets paid $95,000. They enlist right after high school as well, most have no past work experience, or they have minimum wage experience but with really good managers and bosses.  Both groups are toxic for someone who doesn't exactly have their mind made up. Group 1 will make people stay in a career that they are miserable in and make them think that it's not possible to get a job on the outside. Group 2 will make people unprepared for civilian life.   I've experienced the extremes of both of these groups, because I decided on getting out of the Navy during my first contract. And both groups approached me and tried to scare me into whatever. However, I've had a civilian career before, I know what the civilian world is like, I'm already preparing for civilian life and I don't even get out for another year. Transitioning from sailor to civilian isn't painful or stressful if you have a plan on what you're doing."

Do you 20, do another 10+ or more in the private sector. Sit around and live pretty well off two retirements and their savings, then later kick in social security. They aren't rich by a long shot, but they have enough money to do things they want.  Here is how I look at it though. It could be, if you are pretty lucky life wise, 1/4th of your life, probably more. If you are going to be miserable for 1/4th of your life, get the hell out ASAP. Nothing is worth that."

Look at what you are doing now, and try to relate that to the outside world. If you don't think a regular company is going to need somebody to do something like say Aviation Ordnance for them everyday, then chances are you are probably better off doing 20. I did 10, got my degree in something completely unrelated to what I was doing in the Navy. I was an E6 when I got out and in just 3 years of being out I have surpassed my E6 pay. Do what is best for you, if that is 20 do 20, if it is 4 do 4. You're the one that has to live your life, not some old salt who's rank won't mean anything the day they retire."

I hold absolutely no ill-will towards lifers. I originally planned to do the same.   why do I keep hearing this from senior enlisted?   Because it's all they know.   Consider the life of your average senior enlisted. Join at 18 with maybe a part time high school job as their only work experience. Enjoys their job enough (or got themselves in a poor financial position where they feel the need) to re-enlist multiple times. Throughout their career, the idea gets reenforced that getting a job on the outside is hard (it's not!). It becomes an echo chamber with other senior enlisted. ""Already did 10, you're halfway there"" is a common sentiment. For most, that's after reenlisting only twice. Even if they don't enjoy their job anymore (or their financial situation is better), the sunk cost fallacy takes over. Not with money, but their time, years of their life they can't get back. Might as well get a retirement, right?  I believe you should re-enlist only if you can't imagine yourself doing any other job, ever. Some people love the military that much, my dad included. Good for them! Seriously, we need guys who fucking live for this shit. But you know what, for the majority of us, that's just not the case."

navy,39lnp3,nikizzard,2,Sat Jun 13 09:14:11 2015 UTC,Financially it is probably the single best thing you can do for your future self.   An 04 or E8 with 20-24 years service retirement will be roughly 30-40k per year.   For a 45 year old to buy a lifetime annuity of 35k it would cost roughly 7.5 million dollars. The day you retire you become a multi millionaire.   Additionally assuming you maxed out your TSP every year for 20 years you will have well over 500k in tax advantages accounts. By the time you are 65 that will become roughly 2 million dollars. Even if you only receive 4% interest in that two mil in retirement that is an additional 80k per year on top of your 30/40k retirement.   At age 65 you are pulling down 110k per year not doing a damn thing. That is assuming you never work a day in your life past your 20 year naval career. Assuming you maxed tsp every year in the lifetime funds.   Why do 20 years? Because making six figures sitting on your ass is awesome.
navy,39lnp3,Send_Lawyers,3,Sat Jun 13 01:25:16 2015 UTC,"While I agree with your sentiment, I have a few problems with your math.  First, you can make it to but not past 20 as an E6. I also wouldn't be seriously surprised if I saw a 24-year O5. So, realistically, you're looking at a range of $21-36k (enlisted) or $44-60k (officer). If you're looking at the range of only 20-24 years, that is.  Next, your assumption that you max your TSP every year. The max is $18k this year. The vast majority of servicemembers, especially enlisted, either can't or won't put away $750 per month. I can only afford to do so now, after I got out. There's no way I would, or even could, have put 100% of my E-3 paycheck into the TSP when I had first joined.  I do agree about the lifecycle fund,and that the amounts are possible if you max it, I'm just saying most people aren't in a position to do it.   a lifetime annuity of 35k it would cost roughly 7.5 million dollars   But enough to draw your figure of $30-40k only requires $750k-1m in an index fund, if you follow the 4% safe withdrawl rule. You're off by an order of magnitude on the low end. I think you might enjoy /r/financialindependence, if you haven't checked it out.   At age 65 you are pulling down 110k per year not doing a damn thing.   I absolutely agree, but to counter, I'm at age 27, and I already make almost that amount, and my job isn't really that stressful. In fact, when I work nights, I already just sit on my ass for most of my shift. I can actually afford to max my 401(k) and an IRA, and still have extra to pay my mortgage very quickly, and I will have enough to retire when I am 45. The guys who stay in to 20 and don't save anything will be just starting out their second careers at that time in their lives."
navy,39lnp3,nowhereian,1 point,Sat Jun 13 11:07:12 2015 UTC,I'm an O. I will say I was guessing at E numbers.   That lifetime annuity number was arrived at back in 2008 when i looked at a 20 year O4 retirement package with health care.   To achieve that same pension plus health insurance for life from age 45 as a healthy white male in 2008 cost 7.5 mil.   Can it be had for less through a non annuity? sure. Is a non annuity guaranteed? No.   As a civy you could make bill gates money. You could also be the homeless vet on the corner.   Just saying the reason people say do twenty is because it is an almost certain free ride to financial independence.
navy,39lnp3,Send_Lawyers,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:29:59 2015 UTC,"the reason people say do twenty is because it is an almost certain free ride to financial independence.    Absolutely. But only if you know what you're doing, have a plan from the get-go, and follow through all the way.  If I could go back in time and do it all over again, I would pick a rate I enjoy instead of one that threw a large bonus at me, vastly raise my TSP contributions, and buy a beater car with cash. My net worth would be somewhere around $100k higher than it is now, and I'd stay in for at least 20. But that's with the financial knowledge I have now. I didn't know anything about this stuff at 18.  Actually, if I were to go back to 2007 again with my current knowledge, I'd eat ramen and invest everything I could in AAPL, TSLA, and bitcoins, and that $100k figure above would be laughably small. I'd be retired now. But that's beside the point entirely."
navy,39lnp3,nowhereian,0,Sat Jun 13 13:52:32 2015 UTC,"Your numbers are way way off.   2 million in cash would yield you 60K a year based on a 3% return.   3% is historically close to the risk free interest rate.   The only way anyone is getting 60K after 20 is being an O-5 or above.     To play Devil's advocate,  you could also get killed or seriously maimed in the military making financial independence useless."
navy,39lnp3,Kailuafornia,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:14:04 2015 UTC,Again you're not taking health care into account. And an annuity is risk free guaranteed amount. It isn't an interest payment it's a financial service. No one in their right mind would buy one at 45. It's horribly over priced. It is only used as a valuation of just how great a 30-40k life time pension is actually worth.   and you're more likely to die in a car crash than in your navy job. Or cancer if you smoke or heart attack from being a fat slob. We all might know someone who died but that's true in the civilian world too.
navy,39lnp3,Send_Lawyers,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:28:30 2015 UTC,Health care does not cost 5 million dollars.    Your annuity equation is a joke because it would never be used in practice.  The pv of a perpetuity would be used.  And the value of a O5 retirement is around 2 mil.    Health care cost around 1k a month for a family for a hmo like kaiser.    So you're numbers are way off.

Did you know that only about 11-12% of servicemembers who join ever make it to the 20 year mark?  The vast majority of those serving don't get to draw a single retirement benefit*.  Several years ago there was a proposal to redo the system to more of a 401k style plan where you could take the amount vested with you no matter when you left.  That meant you could do 10 years and have a decent nest egg to take with you into civilian life that you could continue building upon.

We can definitely tell when a final controller on a GCA is a trainee as well, and the IPs like to make sure the final controllers are getting good training too, as you guys are going to eventually be the guys getting us back onto the ship in shit weather at night!  I know of a few ATC guys that recently left Meridian and got sea orders with the Ford and will be working with the latest and greatest tech on there as they get her ready for commissioning  Funny enough, having flown into Pt Mugu and North Island recently, the ATIS actually requested that we request PARs and ASRs so their controllers could get training and stay current"

I once made the mistake of mixing the brown t-shirt with regular civilian shorts while mowing the battalion lawn one fine Saturday.  Don't mix uniforms with civilian gear.    In the navy I see this all the time.  We are told PT gear is an official Navy Uniform but this weekend at the gym I saw a woman wearing Navy sweat pants and a sweater over a flannel.  I asked my chief but he admitted not knowing and suggested I find a proper sea lawyer.

We get issued a pair in boot camp, but that's more because Chicago is cold and we wear sweats most of the first week. They are not on the item list for a seabag inspection.  The Navy (most commands that I've seen, at least) are a lot more relaxed about what you wear to PT than other branches.

navy,39nmqx,IAnswerYourDumbShit,4,Sat Jun 13 01:32:51 2015 UTC,"First off, are you doing real sit ups or Navy sit ups? Ive run into a lot of people joining who dont know the Navy Sit-up is more like a crunch/headbob."
navy,39nmqx,BusterBluth13,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:27:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. Touch thigh with elbow and go back down using gravity, not your muscles. Sitting all the way up will tire you faster."
navy,39nmqx,happybadger,3,Sun Jun 14 02:06:39 2015 UTC,"If you want to get your push ups and sit ups higher, focus on overall core strength which has the side effect of helping you tremendously during the punitive PT sessions in boot camp. Flutter kicks, planks, side and bicycle crunches, rollouts, combine those with lots of squats and you're going to be so much better off. Doing those raised me from like 50/50 coming in to 80/100 now, not studly or anything but a marked improvement for little investment.  Also, if you have a rate that possibly puts you with marines, work some pull ups into your routine because their PRT includes them and the Navy doesn't help you at all with building those muscles. A perfect score is 20, a minimum is 3, you can go 0 to 10 in about a month just by holding yourself midway up."

If so, Vinson was one of the biggest proponents for the Navy in the pre-WW2 congress.

He wrote and got the landmark Vinson-Trammel Act passed into law, as well as the Second Vinson Act, Third Vinson Act, and the Two-Ocean Navy Act.  That provided authority for the eventual construction of ninety-two major warships to replace obsolete WWI ships and the birth of the two-ocean Navy.

In his inaugural address, he argued that the Constitution was a more perfect union than the earlier Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, that it was a binding contract, and called any secession ""legally void"".[125] He had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but said that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property. The government would make no move to recover post offices, and if resisted, mail delivery would end at state lines. Where popular conditions did not allow peaceful enforcement of Federal law, U.S. Marshals and Judges would be withdrawn. No mention was made of bullion lost from U.S. mints in Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina. In Lincoln's inaugural address, U.S. policy would only collect import duties at its ports; there could be no serious injury to justify revolution in the politics of four years. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union All sources are cited in the documentation   Where are you getting your information from, again?"

A pre-war February Peace Conference of 1861 met in Washington, Lincoln sneaking into town to stay in the Conference's hotel its last three days. The attempt failed at resolving the crisis, but the remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy following a two-to-one no-vote in Virginia's First Secessionist Convention on April 4, 1861.

Lee and Jackson didn't fight FOR slavery, they both fought in defense of their homes. Lee was a cavalry Colonel, offered command of the Army of the Potomac (Union Army), and turned it down to go home and defend his bedridden wife and land. By the way, Mary Washington Lee was a direct descendant of George Washington, and his land was Mount Vernon.  Jackson was an artillery instructor at VMI, and debated with his wife at great length over the religious impact of the war on all of their souls, and particularly his own. In the end he also made the decision to defend his home state, because like Lee, he felt that the Union leaders were invaders and that defense was the justifiable option for his own soul.  Neither relished the war, or the killing. They wrote numerous accounts of this, how they were both haunted by it. Jackson lost sleep, stopped finding solace even in God. Lee lived in dread of his judgement day for the rest of his life, saying that he never forgave himself for leading brothers to kill brothers.  Maybe those don't earn you a warship, but they shouldn't be so criticized for decisions we've never had to make.  /soapbox  Also, Henry M Jackson was a very vocal supporter of the Navy, and when we needed a west coast deterrent base for submarines, he made a large plot of land available in Bangor, WA. That entire base owes its existence to HMJ, which probably justifies having that ship named for him. It's also based there, and the crew has massive community outreach."
navy,39i3b5,daimii,6,Sat Jun 13 13:09:52 2015 UTC,"Look, I'm sure you're a well meaning guy who was probably taught this in school.  I was taught the same thing when I grew up in the South.  The nobility of the Confederate cause and downplaying the role of slavery was a big part of how the Civil War was taught to me.  The problem is that it just isn't true.  Slavery -- or more accurately, the overall social order, of which slavery was a key component, which kept blacks subjugated to whites -- was incredibly important to southern culture and was the key element that the Confederates were seeking to defend.  You don't have to take my word for it.  Here's Alexander Stephens, vice president of the Confederate States of America, in his so-called ""Cornerstone Speech.""  ""The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions—African slavery as it exists among us—the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it—when the ""storm came and the wind blew, it fell.""  ""Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.  "". . . look with confidence to the ultimate universal acknowledgement of the truths upon which our system rests? It is the first government ever instituted upon the principles in strict conformity to nature, and the ordination of Providence, in furnishing the materials of human society. Many governments have been founded upon the principle of the subordination and serfdom of certain classes of the same race; such were and are in violation of the laws of nature. Our system commits no such violation of nature's laws.""  You may also want to read the Declaration of Secession from several states.  Georgia: ""The people of Georgia having dissolved their political connection with the Government of the United States of America, present to their confederates and the world the causes which have led to the separation. For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery...""  Texas: ""In all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States.""  You can read more here: http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/  Were there other grievances?  Yes.

They of course could be seen as racist, but that's due to the time period and what they were taught to believe instead of harboring some hatred or enmity towards blacks.   Slavery is all over the Bible as well so it's not like they were even taught that it might morally wrong and against their creator's wishes."

Right or wrong, whatever the catalyst it could be more accurately simplified as trying to stop a divorce by stalking and beating your spouse.  Simply having the ""moral highground"" does not excuse the overt aggression and antagonism displayed by the Union.  Saying slavery was the entire reason for the civil war is a gross oversimplification. It was literally the tip of the oceberg in a long protracted debate about states rights. The overreaching presidential and federal edicts of today have their origin in the civil war and the way it redefined the relationship between the states and the federal government, and the Lincoln administration's reinterpretation of executive authority.

I'm fairly certain this particular FC already had them; he's one of the most squared away and motivated individuals I've ever met. The whole Ship's Store Sup' qual was kind of his way of giving the middle finger to the training program, I think."
navy,39d28w,TheBeneGesseritWitch,14,Thu Jun 11 02:32:35 2015 UTC,"That is beautiful.  There is a dude on my ship that gave the middle finger to the entire ESWS program (Because our local program was totally worthless and fucked up). How the hell do you not qualify ANYBODY for 2.5 years, then start handing down SP's when people go DINQ?  Made first before his 5 year mark in the Navy, despite no ESWS. Throws a bunch of CPO's under the bus for their own incompetence. There are now a half dozen LOI's in the mess due to this guy. They decide to use ESWS as their opening against him. Drama happens. They're going to send him to mast for not having his pin.  He goes behind the ENTIRE COC's back and routes a request to go TAD to another ship. CO approves it (Dude was in really good with the CO). Goes from a blank PQS to a CPO board in something like 3.5 weeks at that other command.  Comes back to the ship to an even more butt hurt CPO mess. It's now a requal, not an initial qual. He goes DINQ on the requal AFTER his EAOS."
navy,39d28w,No-Coast-Punk,2,Thu Jun 11 02:47:59 2015 UTC,"That's classy!  I had lots of ESWS drama myself.  My old ship had a good run of OCS, STA21, MECP officer people get picked up and the ""rule"" was anyone who was leaving due to those, did so with their ESWS.  I saw several people who went from blank book to pin in 5 days with zero first class or chief boards or look-ups.  Most came into sonar and stated, ""No, I don't need the notes, I just need my book signed off"".  Shit made me rage.  I was dink on my ESWS and I ended up picking up first, so they didn't frock me with the others.  I went from blank book to pinning in some ridiculous timeframe like under a month because I knew everyone and had been there for 2 years at that time.  Super anal retentive ENC was on the board (doom for most ESWS guys).  He didn't care about real knowledge, just dumb facts.  ENC said, ""So....how big are the holes in the Prairie System on the propellors?"".  My reply was, ""5/32"" chief"".  I knew every dipshit question he asked and his rage was super high as I made him look bad in front of his buddies when he couldn't throw me off.  Got pinned/frocked the next day."

I received a full 30 credits (1 year of college!) for my ""A"" school training and military experience, which was enough to qualify me for two degrees instead of one.  It is a bit tricky, because I couldn't have fully used those 30 credits to earn a single degree, because many of the credits only applied as electives, which were maxed out.  However, the second degree required that prerequisites for both degrees were met and a minimum of 150-some credits, regardless of their nature.  So you see, the rules change from college to college and from degree program to degree program.  You have to work with your advisor.  BTW, try to find a college advisor who was a veteran.  There are plenty of them and they will work very diligently to make sure that the most credits as possible will transfer.  For example, even ""typing"", which I did a lot of in my rate, was considered a 3-credit course!"

navy,39b8mc,steinbiggity,-6,Wed Jun 10 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"In 2011, I failed two PRTs back to back, due to BCA. One very badly, and one by 1%.  I lost 70 pounds, and passed the 12, 13, and 14 cycles just fine.   I wont lie, I got lazy this cycle and put on about 15 pounds. Work ups and COM2EX are no excuse for me failing, I realize that it was my own fault. I ended this cycle at 2 pounds and 1% over. It's not the way I wanted to leave the Navy, but all I can do is accept it and move on.  However, I did give 5 years and 10 months of my life to the Navy, and 5 years in particular to this ship. All I'm asking for is to be allowed to work for the next month and change to earn this severance. I talked to CMC today, and he said that he's here to work for me, so hopefully something good will happen out of this."
navy,39b8mc,connork53,14,Wed Jun 10 21:58:48 2015 UTC,Truth comes out.   All you're asking is to get 2 more months? No you're asking to scam so you can get a fat severance package all because you failed to maintain standards.

I might need to fact check this as I'm recalling a 2012 PRT Sep and instructions change all the time.   Commands are not allowed to hold people in order for them to cross time limits and some separations due have NLT XX days.    Release Date: 1/3/2011 2:08:00 PM  WASHINGTON (NNS) -- To comply with DOD-wide policy, members separated from the Navy after Jan. 1 solely for failing the physical fitness test (PFT) portion of the physical fitness assessment (PFA) will not be authorized involuntary separation pay, according to a NAVADMIN released Dec. 29.  Policy for involuntary separations before Jan. 1 did not distinguish between separations for failing the PFT and separations relating to weight control.   Members separated for failing the body composition assessment (BCA) in any of three PFA failures may receive one-half involuntary separation pay as long as they are eligible for such pay in all other respects, including the requirement, if qualified, to serve in either the selected reserve or individual ready reserve.   Members who have been involved in misconduct or who are not performing satisfactorily must be separated for those reasons, not for weight control.

And we rarely have the time or money to do more than place shitty off-brand band-aids.  So the five-year-rule bit overseas USCS workers in the ass. They are not allowed to stay outside of the US for more than 5 years. This rule has always existed but was only recently (2 years now) enforced. As a result, we are losing, quickly, the bulk of the knowledge and skill in Japan. Who wants to uproot their life and move to Japan for 5 years? And the best part? At the end of your contract, you are guaranteed a job. Somewhere. FUCKING SOMEWHERE. They get no say. Sure they get a dream sheet of sorts, but these are retired dudes (and ladies, but mostly dudes.) They've been there when they were in - they deserve stability. We have had folks go to Iowa, Nebraska, Indiana, Virginia amd California. Not one into the same job that they were doing here. So they're talking to their peers, tellin them that this job isn't worth it, and now we're SO undermanned. Add to that the fact that the senior Sailors (E5, 6, 7) are of the ""collateral duty"" generation and have no idea how to actually fix their gear or do maintenance and it's a perfect storm.   FDNF ships are SO overtasked, it's ridiculous. We often have 4-5 weeks to do a whole ship work up, and these are the same 5 weeks that the ship has for ATG and CSCS to come on board and assess and certify. I just did an assessment on a ship that had TWO WEEKS for a TSRA, MOB-E, and their final ATFP cert. I don't know when these Sailors slept. And we have ships from the states in all the time for work, because yay Title 10. I could go on and on - I just hope someone realizes the stress that EVERYONE overseas is under and comes up with a viable solution.  We are broke, and the system is broken. And I have no idea how to fix it."

My orders were cut to go to a particular C school then go to the [ship]. I did that, then they put me in a shop completely unrelated to the C school that was on my orders. Why? Because that new shop was undermanned, and the one for my NEC was overmanned. Why the fuck cut my orders that way, then??  But the situation gets better.  The shop I was in was 2-3 people removed from anyone having the NEC necessary to be in that shop. Our WCS was a quadzip E-4 and learned everything by reading pubs and the civilian contractors that came in. I was an NEC totally unrelated, and we had 1-2 other guys come in and they had kind of related NECs but really weren't helpful at all. The last guy to be trained on the equipment our ship actually used left about a year before I came on.   The stuff we used always broke because nobody knew how to use it right. We didn't know how to fix it and our shop was in total ""pretend to work"" mode. The only guys who knew much were the marines who came with us on Deployment, and by that time everything was mission critical so trying to get training on the equipment while still being able to deliver when CoC wanted was laughable.  There was never a time when we were at home port that the civilian contractor didn't have to come and fix the equipment and/or try to teach us about our jobs.  The whole thing was fucked."

But I also know that trying to go in a direction your chief doesn't want to while still a butter bar is a terrible idea for a variety of reasons.
navy,3984o8,King-of-Karthadasht,2,Sun Jun 14 21:24:24 2015 UTC,I'm in aviation so our Division Officers and Department Heads are a lot more concerned about what is going on inside their aircraft than what is going on in their division/department. Some Division Officers genuinely care but most treat the division as a collateral duty. As a Chief I can't make an Officer care so often times we end up just doing the job for them. I think this is just a squadron issue though. Over the last 3 years I've begun believing that it might be a better idea if the Navy separates  pilots from the maintenance department totally. Aircrew literally bring so little to the table in our world that I think we would be better off without them. I guess the point I'm trying to make is if you care about what's going on then you are already winning in my book.

The amount of inspections we had when we did have maintenance periods crippled our ability to actually fix what needed to be done. Upcoming inspections meant half assed patch jobs to meet deadlines. Getting something done began to need the question ""Done, or done right?"" The administrative 'readiness' trumps actual functionality.   An example: Crash and Salvage is required to attend a week long firefighting and salvage team trainer every 18 months or more than 40% turnover. In a 5 month period we unexpectedly lost (medical, humanitarian reassignment, attempted suicide, etc) 6 personnel out of a qualified 18. When we filled the gaps we were at 60% but were denied school due to lack of funding. By the time we did manage to get the funding it had been 20 months and nearly 75%"

navy,3984o8,Send_Lawyers,4,Wed Jun 10 10:46:43 2015 UTC,"Even assuming you meant ""don't get fired when the ship fails INSURV"", the best part about thing for the Combatant Commander is that it's not even their job to make ship ready for INSURV, that's the job of the TYCOM, not the operational commander. I.e. it should be NAVSURFOR that has to fall on their sword for delivering a broken ship to the combatant commander, not the combatant commander for issuing the tasking.  What this means is that the combatant commander has very little reason not to ask for additional forces or assets. And if NAVSURFOR (or whoever) refuses to send a ship that looks like it should be operational so that they can really repair the ship and train the crew, they get the negative mark immediately. If they do send the ship knowing it's not ready, everything will probably still be fine and all the negative consequences will fall on the next Admiral who's NAVSURFOR.  The cards are all stacked against doing the right thing. It's all a very precarious game we have going on."

This isn't like backdating something to get a fucking NAM.   why would the scientists assigned to his MoH investigation lie? What do they have to gain from saying that his brain was destroyed by an enemy 7.62 round and he was dead before he hit the ground?    They don't but they can only work based on what facts they have at hand...they see brain damage that says he couldn't have done it but do they have a indicator for when the damage occured? They were in a fire fight where he was hit and you don't think it's not at all possible that the damage have been done after the grenade went off?   What do ""politicians"" (assuming you're referring to Sec Def) have to gain from disapproving his medal? All Sec Def is concerned with is protecting the integrity of the awards process.   This is what I am talking about two Marines said that he took the grenade for him,that is two first hand accounts but no that is no good for ol' SecDef.  I just see this as a case of the higher ups refusing to change their stance and talking to you is like trying to tell a wall to become a sidewalk good day to your sir."

The mishap rate for 4/5/84/85 was many times higher than the fleet average. As much as I love having that on my Navy resume it is not a fiscally sustainable mission as it currently stands. I saw it go from mobbing reservists to meet the mission to having IA active component enlisted and second term pilots to deal with the manning strains of a constant combat deployment. If they could have transitioned to a Combat Sierra variant it might have worked but old Hotels are not up to the challenge anymore.

navy,3997yv,BurningBushes2000,2,Wed Jun 10 04:50:34 2015 UTC,"You lose credibility when you say they haven't been operational in a long time.  Did you know that they are currently still deployed, making them the longest deployed Naval Aviation Squadron in history--ever?  Also, there seems to be a hint of DA experience in these posts, yet so quick to shed the SOF Truth that Humans are more important than hardware.  These guys have 3 times the experience of standard fleet crews.  What concerns me the most is the sense of competition coming through in all of this.  Whether your background is haf or gaf, there is no denying the huge shortfall in rotary services to SOF.  We are all on the same page, and I can promise you that just today, the 160th guys often getting accused of trying to get rid of 84/85 for mission creep are thankful for the service 84/85 provide, bc it allows more time to be at home.  If you know anyone in this community ask them about the ""leave"" consequences this year because of this decision.  It is true that CNO did not get rid of these squadrons because of old airframes, insufficient performance or because of the reserve-active model.  He got rid of the squadrons because he thought SOCOM would pick up the bill.  He bluffed(CNAF even used the word bluff at the conference). But SOCOM did not have the flexibility in 2013 that they had in 2011 when this play was designed, bc they got their peter smacked for playing fast and loose with MPF-11 funds and weren't able to pay for GPF.  When SECDEF Rep asked SOCOM what he would do if HSC-84/85 went away, in true SOCOM fashion he said SOCOM would find a way to cover down and complete the mission.  Hence, OSD had no choice but to move forward with the decommission.  If you think the former Seal Congressman is all alone than why did Chairman Thornberry authorize Navy to fund them to 70 million in NDAA/ Why did the entire Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee demand SecDef report on his budget and safety analysis?  Because SOCOM wants 84/85 back, and that is why he told the HASC and SASC that very thing.  As far as the NDAA having the power to prohibit retirement of a platform, I'll agree that is up to debate by the MILDEPs, but multiple congressmen disagree about that."

Since 84 moved from doing Direct Action 3-6 nights a week during OIF/OND to another area in CENTCOM AOR, they have continued to be involved in operations. Just because you aren't read-in doesn't mean they aren't operating. Keep that in mind.  One I can tell you about, that is unclass now, is their support of the 2013 President Obama trip to the Middle East. They were the helicopter lift for the President's emergency response team.  Other than that, they have supported and cultivated partner nations inter-operability and capability through participation in regional SOF exercises. FID is an important mission...keeps us from having to fight every battle ourselves.  They would love to have Sierras...but the Sierras need some modifications in order for them to work.  SOCOM doesn't want to pay because they fear it will set a bad precedent for other service-provided SOF support...they want the capability for free. Navy doesn't want to pay because they believe it outside their core mission...a position the Navy is rapidly moving away from since their move to Decom them had caught Congressional attention, including Rep. Ryan Zinke, a former SEAL Commander.  Just because there is a Navy-SOCOM battle over money doesn't mean the requirements don't exists. SOCOM is only sourcing 70% of their helicopter requirements with the 160th and HSC-84/85. HSC-84/85 are 31% of their dedicated helicopter force for theater-SOF...44% of their medium lift. Any more questions? I would urge you to watch Admiral Manazir's response in the 2nd half of the video."

Actually, 84 and 85 get sick of the austere administrative environment in which they exist...How would you like it if people tried to tell you how to run your mission when they have ZERO operational experience? We have fought the same battle since forever. They had our heads on the chopping block in 2005, axe in the air above us...but when push comes to shove-you can't argue with the proven operation experience and the validated requirements for the assets to exist.

The smoothest way would have been to be on scholarship, but what you can do is try to get in as a ""College Programmer,"" where you'll do everything a scholarship midshipman would, but without the paid tuition and stipend. Sorry. The ultimate goal as a College Programmer is to pick up a scholarship, but what's infinitely more possible is to pick up what's called Advanced Standing, where you're officially in the commissioning pipeline and collecting a stipend, but still no scholarship . This might take 2 or 3 years (full disclosure, a lot of peeps get dissuaded and give it up). The officer corps is shrinking so it'll be tough, particularly at a school with a relatively small unit like USC. However, as a Computer Science major you'll be what the Navy classified as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 major, which they like. Assuming there are any open slots for College Programmers, you'll likely be asked to interview/meet with an officer at USC's ROTC unit, in which you should be able to articulate why you want to be an officer well, and it wouldn't hurt to be ready for a PRT. To sum it up: be proactive, be motivated. Best of luck dude."
navy,394c0r,hefferwolfe6,2,Tue Jun 9 04:36:33 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much it. I just graduated as an advanced standing mid, and being Tier 1 helped me get contracted after two years. Usually it's two years before graduating so if you are doing a four year degree that's the two year point  Grades are the most important aspect. If you have good grades they only care that you can pass the PRT. However, with two equal candidates that have different PT scores, the better PT will be selected."

It's kinda fucked up to suggest, but if you want to pick two, it's PT and GPA that will be the majority of your score. Don't neglect your grades and PT to take on every ROTC collateral they offer in hopes of picking up.   That being said, I do believe that picking up a scholarship requires the COs recommendation, so don't be a dirtbag with a max PFA and a 4.0."

NUPOC is an absolutely incredible deal almost on that basis alone, even ignoring E-6 (and possibly E-7) pay throughout the whole process.

From its inception in 1998 BAH has been clearly defined as a method of increasing military pay to keep in contact with civilian pain in similar fields."
navy,3927a0,mpyne,7,Mon Jun 8 19:50:03 2015 UTC,"From its inception in 1998 BAH has been clearly defined as a method of increasing military pay to keep in contact with civilian pain in similar fields.   No. It hasn't. BAH was the consolidation of BAQ and VHA (interestingly, the Navy military pay system still records your BAH as a combination of BAQ and VHA...). If BAH were meant to supplement your basic pay they'd give it to everybody, and they'd make it taxable.  The reason they didn't is because it's meant to pay for housing and housing-related expenses. The reason they didn't treat it like OHA or TDY lodging (which are generally capped to actual expenses) is because it would be administratively impracticable. It might still be administratively impracticable, but no one seems to be complaining that it would be impossible to implement, they're complaining that the $$$ is about to go dry.  BAH is about your overall compensation, sure, in that part of the way the military tries to keep pace with civilian pay was to provide you ""3 hots and a cot"" (i.e. food and housing). So when the government didn't put you in housing themselves (which is what used to be the norm), they would arrange to pay for the lodging you'd have to obtain out ""on the economy"".  They did raise the amount that BAH would cover from about 80% (i.e. they used to expect you to pay 20% of your own housing costs, presumably when you still had the theoretical option of staying in govt. quarters) to covering 100% of housing expenses. But that didn't apply to the many servicemembers still assigned to barracks, aboard a ship, or in family housing (government or PPV-run), and still doesn't apply today.  This hasn't been thought through very well though... as you can tell from the attempts to tweak the bill to also penalize having roommates (since otherwise you could just be ""roommates"" with the supposed love of your life). Good luck trying to track the admin on that, especially near training schools where a single house might cycle through multiple sets of roommates over the course of a single long class."
navy,3927a0,TheBeneGesseritWitch,3,Mon Jun 8 23:06:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, The burden of enforcing the policy is ridiculous and not really practical.    The GS system has pay that is standard but you get bonuses based on your geographical area called locality pay.  Adopting a system similar to this might be a solution with the addition of pro-pays and special duty pays and such.  We go down that road though we might as well start paying people based on billet though..."
navy,3927a0,mpyne,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:18:33 2015 UTC,"Locality pay could be done but still wouldn't replace the need for a housing allowance of some sort. Though we could handle it like BAS and just give everyone BAH, but then we'd have to charge them for living in government quarters, which would be a whole different ball of wax..."
navy,3927a0,club41,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:24:31 2015 UTC,That's the current way it is done. If you are assigned a BEQ your LES shows BAH and then in the deposits that same money is taken out for housing.
navy,3927a0,Poopkitty,2,Tue Jun 9 02:39:22 2015 UTC,"I believe that's only the case for public-private ventures where the Navy has contracted out the upkeep of a BEQ. We do likewise for some PPV housing, but it's not true uniformly (I was the guy telling PSD clerks what FIDs they had to make sure to put into the member's MMPA, so I would know unless they've changed it recently). In those situations the MILPAY system effectively treats you as not being assigned government quarters, but then they deduct the BAH right back out of your pay to reimburse the private contractor.  In situations where the quarters really are government quarters (e.g. aboard ship or if we have any non-PPV housing left) you shouldn't see a BAH line at all in your LES."
navy,3927a0,TheBeneGesseritWitch,2,Tue Jun 9 03:16:37 2015 UTC,"BAH has nothing to do with matching civilian pay. BAH is to provide funds so you can live out on the economy. Take away BAH and everyone is back onboard like the early 90s, cept for the married people.    Since they have let the BAH genie out of the bottle it will be hard to reign it back in as lifestyles have become used to it. One reason it's hard to get Mil-Mil to go overseas as both sacrifice their  OHA."

navy,3927a0,TheBeneGesseritWitch,2,Tue Jun 9 03:25:09 2015 UTC,"Correct. I think the MAIN reason it's hard to get Dual-Mil overseas is the optempo. It sucks ass. We both get (got) COLA, so the money isn't really a factor (for us or any other dual-mil couple that contemplated coming here.)"
navy,3927a0,Peanutbutterdildo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"Correct. Our new cap is his OHA + My OHA. It works like regular OHA, anything over our rent is not given to us.   We do, however, get MIHA and utilities pay, which helps mitigate some of that lost BAH. However, unless we are both actually deployed, that entire utility payment actually goes toward utilities. Japanese houses aren't insulated. So if we're home, that AC/Heater is being run constantly."
navy,3927a0,chillbull,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:34:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is not true. Mr. BGW and I combined our OHA. As far as I know, we are the only couple out here to have done that. (it's amazing what bringing printed naval instructions into the office will get you) Two E-6 OHAs = roughly O-9 OHA. We could have done like every other dual military couple I know and gotten two separate houses, but what we wanted/needed in a house wasn't feasible under one OHA.   (Location--halfway between his base and mine, which is a 45-60 minute drive for each of us  Allowing a dog/yard  Room for the kid  Two car parking  believe it or not, those all of those things are next to impossible to find in a house in Japan.)  It did take us sitting down with the housing director and Mr. BGW's CMC before they agreed to accommodate us, because Housing had no idea they were allowed to do what we wanted.   EDIT: to clarify, the house we found was way under our OHA cap, so we are actually saving the Navy a significant amount of money by living together."

navy,3927a0,BlackSquirrel05,6,Mon Jun 8 22:22:03 2015 UTC,"There are fewer women than men in the military, and women marry fellow servicemembers at a proportionally higher rate.  With that said I don't agree with that reasoning; if it's really about ""equal pay for equal work"" then fight the policy on those grounds, not because one protected group might be more disadvantaged than another one. Otherwise they'd never be able to reduce things like medical or JAG-related special pays since they'd affect proportionally more women than a special pay tied to URL communities or warfare ratings."

A higher percentage of active duty men marry civilian than active duty women marry civilians.   That being said, it wasn't written ""to target"" women. It just has an unfortunate negative side-effect of impacting a higher percentage of women than men, and as the big push is ""gender equality"" and to lessen the gender disparity gap, it seems like a counterproductive move.   And you bring up a very interesting point about pay based on family composition that hadn't been previously addressed.

I would elevate this to that level if your NOSC CO, admin O, and senior enlisted leader are unable to give you the correct answer.

Sometimes you were seen doing something against the grain by someone who cared enough to make it an issue, so your Div Office (LPO or Chief usually) will counsel you so it shows they did something, and to sort of give you a heads up to keep your nose clean because something you did rustled someones jimmy's.  If you are a shitty sailor they can also be used to establish a pattern of bad behavior that shows your leadership saw a problem and tried to correct it.

If you focus too much on the first part you're going to miss out on an opportunity to learn and grow as a person. It's not easy being told that you're wrong and it's even harder to accept it and push forward, especially when your fuckup (perceived or otherwise) is given the semi-permanence of a chit.

I put down around 11 minutes and when I was 18, I was in the low 9s.  Being a good runner does take some time and effort, but you will get in great shape fast.  Start out with two or three 5ks a week mixed with a few fast milers on alternate days.  For the 5ks, start out slow and comfortable.  Enjoy the run.  You should be able to carry on a conversation, but not be able to sing.  A mid 11 or even 12 minute pace may seem like almost walking, but it's how you build your cardiovascular base.  As your cardio improves, you will notice that your times will increase without much more perceived effort.  I tell people to set an initial goal between 30-35 minutes for the 5k depending on your start point.  Before you know it, you'll be sub 25.  The fast milers are for increasing the pain threshold you deal with when running at the increased pace required for the PRT.  Running form and technique tends to come with practice, but if you think you may be dangerously over or under pronating, maybe set up an analysis by sports medicine.    Or you could watch TV in the gym while doing it on the bike."

However if the power limit is X% and current power is X-1%, or at the limit, I'm not going to freak out (provided it makes sense within the context of plant conditions).  The argument just strikes me as a ""how many pieces of flair"" question.  I've never had any issues with PFAs and think that a score of ""Good"" isn't hard to attain, but if something is within limits then it's good.  If someone scores SATs on the PFA then they are meeting the requirements, and if they have no history of PFA failures then who cares?"

Just like they presumably care about your response to a flooding casualty even if you were technically within the assumed response time for the CP, just like they presumably care about your response to a steam line rupture casualty even if you were technically within the assumed response time for that, etc., etc.  In the case of every such command I went to there was a ""non-FEP"" standard that didn't change: Good or higher. Because it wasn't about ""pieces of flair"" (otherwise the standard would be Outstanding), but instead about not having to have Big Navy come in for administrative processing of their crew. I'm sorry that the difference isn't immediately apparent to you, but it is there.  P.S. How do I know this was a rule on my boat? Because I made the mistake of only getting SAT on my second PFA there. Turns out O-gang gets put on FEP too..."

You make good points on the matter and I can definitely see your perspective.

Being skeptical of authority is healthy, especially if that authority is in the wrong, you're job is to find out the facts and if they are wrong kindly ask or clarify how there interpretation is different then the written regulations."

They do have barracks rooms available; it depends on rank, command, and deployability status. He's an AT1 on shore, and they put him in one until we got housing ironed out (I'm an HT1 in Yoko, so for us housing was.....complicated).  Atsugi is a quiet, small town. Day trips to Yokohama/Tokyo are  easily doable and nice to get out away from all the sailors.   My husband loves his command. I watched him go from angry ""screw it, I'm retiring as a first class, I don't even care!"" to ""hey, I'm gonna be super involved in my command because this place is awesome!  Do:  Get a passport. Not just a no-fee, get a tourist passport. You can't travel on a no-fee unless on official government business. Flying home on leave does not equal official business.   Square your seabag away. Your NEX is the size of a postage stamp. Yokosuka is the largest NEX in Japan, and it's still the size of....a  slightly bigger postage stamp. Our uniform shop is always out anyway.    Open a ""Flight Home"" savings account and put ~$200 in a month. Tickets average $2,000. I promise, socking a little away over the year makes taking leave way less stressful.   PM me if you have any questions.   Don't:  Ignore your sponsor. They take this sponsorship stuff in 7th fleet super seriously. If you aren't having a good rapport with your sponsor, let the cmc@yourcommand.fe.navy.mil know....  Take a cab from the airport. Narita is like...2 hours, ish, Haneda is about 3 hours from Atsugi...that's a stupid expensive choice to take a cab. There is a government bus that will get you to the base. I will ask Mr. BGW to send me the link, and post for you.   Keep your American phone plan.  The american company is gonna try to sell you on an international plan. Don't. Any calls you make here to local numbers (and for your friends to call you here too) will cost you international fees. Sure you can call home.....but it is cheaper to get a Japanese phone (which you will end up doing anyway) and using magic jack, Skype, call free apps on a smart phone, or if you belong to iNation, FaceTime.   Drink underage. Drink and drive. Drink at all, really. Driving drunk is Japan is a .02 BCA. WAAAAY lower than the US. Due to a past history of stupid sailors involving alcohol, Japanese locals are a little leery of us. There have been rapes, murders, thefts, trashing places, assault....all because a drunk sailor is a stupid sailor. So if you drink, do so wisely. Last sailor to drink and do something stupid put all of 7th fleet at ""restricted to base"" liberty and then got a curfew slapped down that just recently got lifted. Kind of. Slightly lifted.

MWR has discounted tickets for lots of stuff, use them for local tours too.  Some things have changed a bit since I was there so I can't give you many details.  My friend just came back from Atsugi, he was married and had to live on base.  They went to the Robot Restaurant, which looked way cool.    And the food ... oh man.  So good.

SARP needs to make that clear and have a firm position on that. There are many case of sexual abuse gone unreported. IT is not because the victim don't want to report. It is because SARP doesn't take them seriously. It is because SARP stops when seeing a high rank officer/commander is involved. This needs to stop.

It will not change where you rank, it will not bump you from a P to an MP or an MP to an EP, and (right or wrong) your chain of command won't like it. But statements should absolutely be used to include anything factual that wasn't put in your eval. For example: You completed your Bachelor's Degree during the reporting period but it's not in your eval. A good chain of command should never let one of their Sailors submit a statement. A Sailor that works for a good chain of command should never have to submit a statement. If it's fact based and they have proof, it should be in their eval."

This was back when you could give unlimited MPs as well. He filed a statement and a grievance against him. He was honestly pretty terrible to his guys. It didn't really do anything though. The chief picked up senior and the E-5 justifiably got out of the Navy.   If you are going to file a statement, it should be on the grounds of missing information.

My last Eval was simply for my E-4 test and was really only to give myself and one other an average. Now I'm sure many of you are aware that IT3 is always 100% or has been for a very long time. The difference between the two people getting the evals... myself had been on the ship for two years, gotten a pin, volunteer hours, and  multiple collateral duties. The other guy was brand new just checked on the ship. Nothing wrong with that at all. He was even pretty solid at work thus far. Both of us had Eval written up for us and both of us were given MP. I was given a 4.22 average and he was given a 3.8. I submitted a statement because I wanted to know who thought I wasn't worth the EP and why? Was it needed? No. Was I happy about being worth the same as someone who just checked on board? No. So I had to talk to my DH,DLCPO,LCPO all at the same time. They told me it didn't matter IT3 is 100%. So I then got a lot of hate on sole principle.  I no longer care about Evals. Do I realize how ridiculous it is to be upset over an MP on a 100% test? Yeah. I will be damned if I'm not one of the most stubborn out there on things like this though.  My advice would be don't submit a statement, it's not worth it. I never even got a good answer. I was basically told I was getting what I get. That nothing I had done in the past year even mattered because of a 100% quota."
navy,38u3ku,club41,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:32:19 2015 UTC,I don't see a reason for hate. Your situation is one I've seen and been part of numerous times. I've seen Reporting Seniors who will sacrifice the EP just because and I've seen Reporting Seniors who will rank everyone accordingly in the summary group. Just another issue I have with the eval system as there is so much variation from command to command and if you end up at the wrong one you either float or sink.    Just because IT3 is 100% is that suppose to be your ultimate goal for advancement? I've seen ITC's whose 5 year look had to include PO3 evals.

I once checked the box for a statement in my youth as I received my first P (E6 at the time) and couldn't see the big picture of me being a newly reported E-6 in a command of 100+ First Classes. I never followed through with the statement as what could I have said that warranted an eval change. It was a fair eval, I just couldn't get over my first P."
navy,38s8qu,TheBeneGesseritWitch,25,Sat Jun 6 10:48:37 2015 UTC,Um..... duh. Any sailor who's been on a deployment could have told you that. Nice of Greenert to finally understand what everyone already knew. They have been burning the candle at both ends for far too long and honestly the damage has already been done. That said for some reason I have the feeling they will fall back into old habits within a few years. We don't have enough ships or man power to maintain the operational schedule that Washington wants. I highly doubt we will see any programs to boost the number of ships or man power with in the next decade. So they have the choice of gaps in on station time (which after this I don't think they will do again) or they will have to go back to longer deployments.
navy,38s8qu,XDingoX83,14,Sat Jun 6 11:07:00 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be the Piss-Poor Morale Officer, but military life becomes decidedly rougher during drawdown.  Particularly for the Navy and OPTEMPOs.    I was in during the First Gulf War.  We were still going on seven and eight month deployments, but it was considered to be more or less unusual.  After the Gulf War ended drawdown started.  There were a ton of changes, including the contraction of manpower sources, scarcity of ""luxury"" items like MWR stuff, etc.    Then the Clinton Administration took over, and slammed on the drawdown accelerator.  We went from a nearly 600 ship Navy to almost 300 practically (but not literally) overnight.     Which would have been fine.   Except the Administration wanted to maintain the kind of OPTEMPO we had during the Cold War.  Being on a CGN, we particularly felt it at the end of the fiscal year because fuel burners didn't have the gas to go on operations.     It sucked mightily. Indeed, this state of affairs was a major contributing factor for getting out.  I was tiring of the ""more with less"" horseshit we were getting through the CNO from the White House.  No one gave a flying fuck what 9 month deployments or three-section inport duty was doing to morale.    I don't want to scare anyone.   I just want to make sure everyone understands that shitty post war OPTEMPOs are not necessarily a new thing.  And that it might take a long, long time to get better.  You need to either accept it as the new reality and find a way to deal with it; or start looking at TAP, or whatever they call transition programs these days.  Not knocking anything. Just saying it's time to start assessing certain realities.    Edit:  Punctuation"

I am not claiming that we had it worse than anyone else in the fleet but the situation we dealt with everyday didn't lend itself to us being friendly with the carrier.

navy,38s8qu,phuqer,3,Sat Jun 6 17:47:25 2015 UTC,"The Navy plans to pull its carrier presence out of the Middle East temporarily this fall, which will sideline the Navy's premier airstrike platform for the first time since the outbreak of Operation Inherent Resolve.  The break in presence will likely last from one to two months after the carrier Theodore Roosevelt departs U.S. Central Command this fall. Theodore Roosevelt will be replaced by Truman and its escorts in 5th Fleet early this winter, according to Navy officials who spoke on background to discuss future operations.  The break in carrier presence in the middle of a fight with the Islamic State group is a setback, but Navy officials say it's a consequence of years of strain placed on the fleet by increasing demands and decreasing budgets.  The gap in carrier presence in 5th Fleet, if it materializes, is a strong indication that Navy leaders are following through on their commitment to scale back marathon deployment lengths that have taken a heavy toll on morale and on the material condition of its ships.  ""The increased frequency and extension of carrier strike group deployments increased wear on the force, which led to increased maintenance and repair requirements and lengthened maintenance availability periods,"" said Navy spokesman Cmdr. William Marks.  ""As a result of meeting increased [combatant commander] demand in previous years, sequestration's impact on our shipyards, and having a force structure of 10 (rather than 11) carriers, the Navy is not scheduled to provide a continuous carrier presence in some operating regions in fiscal year 2016.""  The gap in presence is not a done deal, and Theodore Roosevelt could still be extended if requested by Central Command and approved by Defense Secretary Ash Carter. But leaders including Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jon Greenert have been vocal about the need to get deployments back to a sustainable length.  Since 2011, the Navy has seen ever-longer deployments, some more than 10 months. The Navy partially blames the onerous deployments on having to provide two carriers at all times in the Persian Gulf between 2011 and 2013. The requirement forced the service to extend deployments while critical maintenance was performed on stateside carriers and escort ships.  Marine Lt. Gen. John A. Toolan, commander, U.S. Marine Marine Lt. Gen. John A. Toolan, commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, watches an AV-8B Harrier take off from the USS Essex. The amphibious assault ship is to arrive in the Middle East in weeks, and will be there through the end of the year. (Photo: Lance Cpl. Wesley Timm/Navy) The second big hit to deployment lengths was work stoppages in the public shipyards, the result of furloughs after the first round of across-the-board budget cuts, known as sequestration, in 2013. That set already strained maintenance schedules even further behind.  The Navy's top officer told Navy Times in March that even with another round of cuts pending, the Navy had no choice but to get back on track.  ""It is not my plan to go back to long deployments,"" Greenert said in the exclusive March 24 interview. ""It is not my intent to go back to eight- or nine-month deployments: I believe they are unsustainable.""  A Navy official who spoke on background said Navy leaders have said repeatedly that the heavy demands placed on the fleet would impact its ability to provide presence down the road. The service projects that it will take until about 2020 to get back on track with its normal presence schedule, and that it will likely be necessary to gap presence again while the service resets, the official said.  Still, the Navy will not be leaving Central Command barren. The Essex Amphibious Ready Group, with its Harriers, is deployed and will likely be in Central Command through most of the rest of the year. In the meantime, the Air Force's land-based fighters will pick up the slack in Operation Inherent Resolve for the missing carrier air wing.  Jerry Hendrix, a retired captain and analyst with the Center for a New American Security, said the plan to gap CENTCOM is a sign the Navy is serious about getting its deployments shorter, but said the forces remaining in CENTCOM can cover for the lack of a super carrier.  ""The Navy is trying to remain true to its commitment to bring deployment lengths down,"" Hendrix said. ""But it also shows that the Navy recognizes the utility of its force. The [landing helicopter dock] is a highly capable platform, it has helos and Harriers on board, and it will be enough to meet the immediate tactical requirements of the area."""

AD members as donors (living)  (1) AD members may serve as living-related or living-unrelated organ donors in the absence of better-matched volunteer donors.  (2) The AD member must be counseled in writing prior to becoming a living donor by his or her immediate commander with a follow-on counseling by a medical officer, preferably an internist, who can review preliminary results as well. The counseling sessions must ensure that the AD member understands that his or her qualification for continued service will be contingent upon favorable medical evaluation results following organ donation.  (3) Prior approval from BUMED M3/5 is required when a living organ donation by an AD Navy member is to be performed in a transplant facility other than the Army/Navy Organ Transplant Servicer. Submit requests for such approval through the individual's unit commander to the local MTF Patient Administration Division to be forwarded to the Navy Medicine Regional Commanders with consultation with the Army/Navy Organ Transplant Service. Circumstances requiring more immediate response may be approved telephonically by contacting the Living Donor Transplant Coordinator at (202) 782-6462. All requests to serve as an AD live organ donor other than in the Army/Navy Organ Transplant Service must contain the following information:  a. Name, grade, social security number (SSN), and military unit/location of prospective donor.  b. Recipient's name and relationship to donor.  c. Recipient's primary diagnosis and prognosis.  d. Name of recipient's physician and place of transplant.  e. Statement acknowledging prospective donor's understanding of required counseling by a medical officer.  f. Acknowledgment that the Navy is not responsible for any costs associated with a transplant performed in a civilian institution except when the recipient is a DoD beneficiary, in which case TRICARE pays the bills of both recipient and donor.  g. DD Form 2808 (Report of Medical Examination) and DD Form 2807–1 (Report of Medical History) completed within 3 months preceding the request.  h. Basic laboratory exams, including urinalysis, complete blood count, blood urine nitrogen/creatinine, serum electrolytes, and fasting glucose obtained during initial physical evaluation by a military physician. For potential liver donors, a record of liver function tests is also required. If the potential liver donor is over 40 years old, a cardiac evaluation is needed, preferably including a graded exercise test.  i. A copy of the results of compatability testing performed at the transplanting institution   j. Statement that a follow up medical evaluation by a military nephrologist, or internist in consultation with a nephrologist will be completed at 3, 6, and 12 months after donation. The evaluation should include blood pressure, urinalysis, and serum creatinine for kidney donors and liver function tests for liver donors.  (4) AD Navy members approved under this paragraph for organ donation will be placed in an absent sick status at the time of admission to a non-military MTF (civilian facility) through discharge. Convalescent leave must be approved by a Navy MTF. Administrative responsi- bility will be assumed by the appropriate Navy MTF. Any absence from duty before hospital admission will be charged as ordinary leave.  (5) An AD Navy member in a non-military medical facility when donating an organ will be transferred to a Navy MTF at that point in his or her hospital course when he or she would normally be discharged. This transfer is not to be used as a means of transferring the responsibility for treatment or expenses associated with the transplant to the Navy but to ensure that the Navy member is medically evaluated after the organ donation to determine his or her future profile, assignments, and qualification for continued service.

But the bottom line to Whidbey is that, while one of the more beautiful CONUS bases, it's very isolated and will take you a long car or boat ride to get to Seattle. Plus, the winters suck (but are better than the general Seattle area). Chilly, windy, rainy. As far as I was concerned, the summers made up for it.

Being a former martial artist with 9 years of practice, it can be assumed that it would be very bad if I lost control of myself in a fit of rage.  They've been more than understanding and have been helping me with coping mechanisms for my anger. I'm sure if I'm fine, he will be to. The Navy only really cares to take action if you're homicidal/suicidal. How am I not considered homicidal?

navy,38gpw0,TheBeneGesseritWitch,4,Fri Jun 5 01:43:47 2015 UTC,"For those of you on mobile:   The Obama administration on Wednesday voiced strong opposition to a controversial congressional proposal to cut back Basic Allowance for Housing for dual-military couples and for troops who share housing with other service members.  The targeted cut in BAH would ""impose a marriage penalty,"" and ""have a disproportionate negative impact on women service members,"" according to a statement outlining the administration's views on the Senate version of the 2016 defense authorization bill, unveiled in May.  The policy floated by the Republican-controlled Senate would limit dual-military couples to one BAH payment, specifically the rate due to the couple's higher-ranking or senior-most service member.  The proposal also would reduce BAH payments for many unmarried troops who share a home or apartment with another service member. For those in paygrades E-4 and higher, they would see their normal BAH rate cut back by 25 percent.  About 40,000 dual-military couples are on active duty around the world today, according to the Defense Department.  One of those couples recently bought a home in suburban Maryland.  ""It's a pretty big piece of money that they are talking about taking away from us,"" said the Navy wife, a 28-year-old helicopter pilot assigned to a post in Maryland, in a telephone interview.  She receives about $1,900 monthly in BAH while her husband, a submariner assigned to a post in Virginia, receives about $2,400 in the tax-free housing allowance. She worries that if the current proposal became law, her Navy family would lose its larger BAH payment because she was commissioned shortly before her husband, making her technically senior to him.  A cut like that would not be catastrophic, she said, noting that her mortgage payment is about $1,900 and potentially manageable on a single BAH payment. But she said she needs that money to help pay for graduate school and also to start a family, which would require full-time child care for two active-duty parents.  ""I kind of look at BAH as a piece of my salary. For someone to say I should get paid less because of who I'm married to doesn't really seem fair,"" she said.  Military families across the force are worried about the proposal, said Joyce Raezer, executive director of the National Military Family Association.  ""They feel like they are being nickel-and-dimed,"" Raezer said in an interview Wednesday.  The proposed cut to BAH is poorly thought out, she said. It could create a negative incentive by offering some troops more money for remaining unmarried. And it will have a disproportionate impact on women because about 20 percent of women on active duty are in dual-military couples, compared with only 3.7 percent of active-duty men.  ""And how are they going to enforce that whole roommate thing?"" Raezer said, wondering what kind of system DoD would develop to determine which service members are living with other service members in private-sector housing.  Today's troops have grown accustomed to a BAH policy that aims to cover up to 100 percent of estimated housing costs in a duty assignment's location.  That marks a big improvement from the 1990s, when BAH was intended only to cover about 80 percent of housing costs and troops and their families were expected to pay the remaining expense out of their own pockets.  Raezer said the rise in BAH has vastly improved service members' quality of life.  But now, as the Pentagon faces budget caps known as sequestration, BAH is a target for saving money.  DoD officially urged Congress to cut today's housing benefit to one that would cover only 95 percent of estimated housing costs. Congress gave that a cool reception last year and approved only a one-percentage-point reduction, to 99 percent.  The proposal in this year's Senate defense authorization bill would impose further gradual reductions.  The outcome of those proposals remains unclear. The House version of the annual defense bill does not contain any changes to BAH and the Obama administration's opposition to the cuts targeting dual-military families will put pressure on the Republican-controlled Senate to drop the measure from the bill in negotiations.  The cuts targeting families ""will degrade the culture and environment needed to keep our military open and welcoming to military families and risks sacrificing the strengths they bring to our nation's defense,"" the Obama administration's statement said."

They think that fairness trumps the needs of the operators.  Here's some truth for you.  Most SEALs want nothing more than to go to ST6.  They train for years, make huge personal sacrifices, risk their lives constantly, and if they actual get the opportunity to try out, one guy in that team can look at their face on day one and say, ""I don't like the way he looks."" and you get shitcanned.

The attitude in America was that blacks aren't as smart, strong, healthy, or able to do the same things as whites. The same attitude that ""women aren't as smart, strong, healthy, or able,"" is just as wrong...and both are contrary to the Navy ideals.   And I tried to find who the first African American SEAL was, I'm not talking about Tiz, he was around before the SEALS were official, and I couldn't find it.

What I'm trying to explain is that ""If they meet the standards."" is the exact wrong attitude to have for SPECWAR.  It's not about meeting minimum standards, it's about finding the best possible candidates.  You may not like that SEALs know that part of the qualification for best possible candidate involves being male, but they do, and it's not from bigotry, it's from realism.  It's so easy to sit back and criticize and fight for 'social justice' and exclaim that women can do anything a man can do, but it's not reality.  You don't have to face the reality.    What you're asking for is unfair.  You're asking that we take people that we know have a lower potential for success in the job, and put them alongside people who are trying to be the best.  This isn't 'take your little brother to the park for basketball', this is goddamned hand to hand warfare.    How will having a woman candidate actually play out?  Plenty of guys who 'meet the standards' aren't liked by the class and get the shit kicked out of them until they quit.  What if the woman just sucks and no one likes her?  Can you imagine the Navy allowing the men in her class to beat the shit out of her and leave her behind on the beach?  If not, then standards will have dropped.    If you're personal mission in life is to say that everyone everyone is exactly equal, then why not start with the NFL.  Let's see you picketing to get 300lb women on the defensive line."
navy,38fm9p,nowyourdoingit,-2,Thu Jun 4 23:40:19 2015 UTC,"When I first commented, I swore I wasn't going to be sucked into a debate; I just wanted to take a second and get the right-to-try comment addressed. But, again, you've said something that has been niggling away at me, so:   Which absolutely sucks, because no SEAL should ever look at another SEAL and question whether or not he got his bird because of the second chance he got from his skin color.    It seems to me all your worry about ""affirmative action"" could easily be turned around and those same questions being asked of white SEALS--did they only make it because of their skin color? Are they fully qualified or did they bump someone out because of the good ol [white] boys club?  It's been about 10 years since I interacted with any SEALS (went to school with Senior Bass and a few others), but there were several who'd been through BUDs a few times before making it. So please educate me why you're so worked up about getting a second chance? Do SEALS not get second chances anymore? According to the NSW Motivator who is always doing AMAs in r/NewToTheNavy there are guys who go through BUDs multiple times before graduation....  My whole point, which you didn't really answer, was ""why can't women try?""  Women rolling through Ranger school didn't lower Ranger standards.   What you're asking for is unfair. You're asking that we take people that we know have a lower potential for success in the job, and put them alongside people who are trying to be the best   Statistically yes, you're right, the average woman has lower potential to pass BUDs. But the average guy isn't gonna pass either. I don't think that denying any person (regardless of rate, race, gender, sexual orientation, sexual identity, or religion) who meets qualifying standards the opportunity to try is right, full stop.   Kristen Beck and Brett Jones are perfect examples--they wouldn't have been SEALS and ""achieved warrior greatness"" if they hadn't lived undercover, hiding their true selves from such prejudice.   Edit: added hyperlinks in case no one knows about the first transwoman and openly gay SEAL."
navy,38fm9p,TheBeneGesseritWitch,4,Fri Jun 5 03:34:58 2015 UTC,"Kristen Beck and Brett Jones were both men.  No one is saying you can't be trans or gay.  Neither of those things affects physical performance.  No one cares if you suck dick, they care if you suck dick at being a SEAL. I know you don't think it's right, but you're wrong.  You're coming at it from the perspective that what we care about is maximizing fairness, but that's not what we care about.  The universe doesn't care if we allow everyone the same opportunities.  The universe has set parameters that we have to follow or we die.  As it stands, having the hormones and developmental profile of a woman makes it more likely that you'll die or get someone killed doing the work of a SEAL, so we don't allow them to do the job.  Same as color blindness, hearing impairment, mental retardation, people too tall/short/fat/skinny/weak/with certain medical conditions/birth defects, certain nationalities, bad credit, etc. etc. etc.  It's  not about lower potential to pass BUD/S.  BUD/S is just the school, not the real world.  SEALs all know that BUD/S is just the beginning.  So a woman makes it through BUD/S and arrives at her Team.  I know 5 guys off the top of my head that were shitcanned during their first platoon for various reasons.  Firing a woman will automatically carry different political consequences.  She'll be treated differently. I'm worked up about getting talked into going right back to the class.  Typically, once you DOR, you're immediately out.  You might be able to reapply after a few years, with the logic being that it's possible for someone to go to the fleet, show a history of professionalism and hard work, mature a bit, and then return for another chance.  You don't get to take a car ride with the Instructors and get motivated to stay in the class because the navy needs more people of color. If you think SEALs have a good 'ol boys club I highly suspect you're lying about having known SEALs.  SEALs are dog eat dog.  They respect people who perform at their jobs, period.  Also, that makes no sense, there's generally no pressure to get more SEALs, so no one is going to get a pass because they're white.  There is some pressure to get minority SEALs, so there have been some guys who have gotten a pass.  That kind of stuff pisses off pretty much everybody when it happens, but it happens.  Politics exist in the Teams, but it's mostly imposed upon them. Women can't try because they are physically inferior for the work.  The issue isn't that a woman couldn't conceivably do everything individually required of a SEAL.  The issue is a woman is going to be at a disadvantage at doing everything required of a SEAL full time.  Are there women that can squat more than me, run faster than me, carry more weight than me, survive longer without food and water than me, etc?  Of course.  Are there women that can go 3 months on a submarine without the ability to do much physical training, then do the op and squat as much as me, run as fast as me, carry as much weight as me, survive without food and water for as long as me?  No.  That's just reality.  Women are not men.  They are not physically equal.  As much as you might want that to be the case, it's not."
navy,38fm9p,nowyourdoingit,-8,Sat Jun 6 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"who are you to say they ""don't have the right to try""?   I think the easy answer is a taxpayer. Yes there exists a woman on this planet that can pass BUD/s. There are probably a lot of women that can do it, but how many will we need to send through BUD/s before we get one SEAL? How much taxpayer money do we need to spend to slap an equality sticker on SEAL teams? Whatever politician approves this program is going to be roasted when after 5 years $10 million has been spent and not a single female has passed."
navy,38fm9p,Charlestonian,2,Sun Jun 7 04:27:24 2015 UTC,"Most men can't go through it. Hell, the number of guys that try and fail is ridiculous. The numerical cost of adding women is statistically negligible. It's not that big of a deal. Let them try. If they fail, well tough shit. If they pass, well now you have one more good SEAL."

navy,38fm9p,HBHT9,7,Thu Jun 4 03:08:10 2015 UTC,"The Defense Department is scheduled to open all operational billets to women on Jan. 1, 2016, unless individual services provide pressing reasons against it or lawmakers intervene.  For the Navy, that means that the storied SEAL brotherhood could be welcoming women early next year — a momentous cultural shift that Navy Secretary Ray Mabus  One of the main concerns around integration is whether qualification standards will be changed to accommodate women, who have higher body fat levels and different fitness standards in the fleet.  The special operations community has a much tougher PRT, and it could change with integration.  ""In all cases, I personally believe we ought to have one standard for both sexes, a standard that matches the demands of the job, and if you pass, you pass,"" Mabus said in a May 13 speech at the Naval Academy.  The Navy is studying current standards to see if they're directly related to doing the job, he said, and will revise them if necessary.  But when asked by a midshipman whether the qualifications would be lowered  ""Keep the standards,"" he said. ""Do not lower standards in any regard.""  Mabus said the Navy Department will make recommendations about how to integrate women as Navy special operators, the last jobs closed to them, to President Obama and Defense Secretary Ash Carter later this year.  This would also affect the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, infantry and other combat jobs still closed to women, as well as the corpsmen and other sailors assigned to these units.  Though he would not elaborate on how standards could change once women are allowed to attend Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training, he alluded to the idea that the special operator fitness standards as they exist are about to change.  ""First we're going to make sure there are standards, second that they're gender-neutral and third that they have something to do with the job,"" Mabus told Navy Times.  The SEALs would be the latest, and the last, of the traditionally male-only branches to open to women during Mabus' tenure.  In 2011, the first female officers reported to ballistic missile submarines, and early this year several more reported to Virginia-class attack subs. Enlisted women are on track to join them next year and the service is already recruiting enlisted women off the streets to enter submarine ratings.  And in 2012, riverine training opened to women, making way for the go-ahead to assign them to billets and deploy them last year.  But what's not clear is how many women would even attempt to be SEALs, even if the career were open to them as the number of women in similar ratings and communities to special warfare are very low.  Both the Navy Diver and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Specialist ratings have been open to women for the better part of 30 years. In those ratings open to women, they rank first and second with the fewest women in their ranks.  Out an end strength of 1,153, there are only seven female ND's — just .61 percent of the force. In EOD as a whole, there's 1,094 sailors of which women make up .91 percent with 10 in the ranks.  In the officer ranks, Explosive Ordnance Disposal officers fill officer billets at both EOD and fleet diver commands — billets that have also been open to women for decades — just 2.79 percent of women in that community are women.  But what Navy officials say they are committed to is that women have the opportunity to serve where they want. Since January 2013, when the Combat Exclusion was ended for good, the Navy first conducted a thorough review of all billets closed to women and since then opened 17,000 of them to women, according to Cmdr. Renee Squier, head of enlisted plans for the chief of naval personnel.  ""The Department of Defense will announce final decisions to integrate the remaining closed positions and occupations and any approved exceptions to policy on or about January 1, 2016,"" Squier said. ""Navy foresees no insurmountable obstacles to integration.""  Staff writer Mark D. Faram contributed to this report."

navy,38fmb9,Professional_Russian,3,Wed Jun 3 22:04:45 2015 UTC,"DLA is dislocation lodging allowance, to pay for the expenses associated with wrapping up non-government quarters and establishing new non-government quarters (i.e. you don't rate DLA if you go from government quarters to government quarters). Full details can be found in a dense multi-megabyte PDF called the ""Joint Travel Regulations"". You get DLA based on your rank and whether you have dependents moving with you or not.  Advance DLA just means that you get paid DLA before you PCS instead of afterward. It doesn't change the amount you get so if you can get the advance it's probably a good idea to do so; it can help with cleaning fees and paying for a security deposit at your new duty station.  I'm a little fuzzier on the details of the travel advance, but it's the same principle. If you know you will be driving then you can already determine how much mileage you'd be reimbursed for, how many days they'll let you take for travel, etc., and in theory get that travel pay advanced to you before you travel.  It is very important to note that you have to make sure to claim any advance travel-related pays on your travel voucher when you finally make it to your ultimate duty station so that you don't get overpaid when the travel is all settled. It's possible to get advanced too much too, which is an incredibly annoying admin nightmare, so try to underestimate if you take an advance.  Since they will only pay for actual lodging expenses (and even that only up to a certain limit) you should keep itemized receipts for every hotel you stop at while on PCS travel. The receipts must be itemized because Uncle Sam won't pay for your porn video rentals or room service while you're camping out in the room, even if those would still be under your lodging allowance cap. So don't bother trying."
navy,38fmb9,mpyne,3,Wed Jun 3 22:19:55 2015 UTC,This. My .02 is you take that DLA up front an claim travel after. Estimates can go awry and you don't want to end up short of your travel advance.
navy,38fmb9,HighOrderDet,3,Wed Jun 3 23:56:28 2015 UTC,"if you can get the advance it's probably a good idea to do so;   I would disagree here based on three things:  How many times has the Navy screwed up your pay? Taking an advance is always more paperwork and thus leads to a higher risk of pay screw ups. In my experience, anyway.  You only get 80% up front, and the rest later after you fill out the DLA statement.   You have 30 days from the receipt of advance DLA to show you've moved into a house. Often, with leave and the process of finding a new place, you are cutting that window very, VERY close. The Navy will recoup that money with extreme prejudice. Also, you don't have a guarantee that you won't be put in a BEQ if you're unaccompanied E6 and below, and/or be in government quarters. If you get there and the command says ""Oh, hey, you're in a BEQ,"" then you owe that money back.   Everything else though I agree 100%, especially the receipts. They must show how much, per night, and be on official-type paper.....a header or something from the hotel. We had a guy try to use his expedia email receipt and it took him about a month of angry phone calls before the hotel would actually email him a receipt; by that time the window to file a travel claim had closed (you have five days upon check in at your new command to complete your travel claim).

We have a sailor headed our way who has called us and asked us to give him a letter to give to his PSD saying he's eligible for DLA--but, he isn't, due to rank and possible open barracks rooms. If he takes advance DLA and gets put in the BEQ (which is a 50-50 odds he will be) he owes it back.   So, if you are absolutely sure you're entitled to it, go ahead and take the advance. But odds are, if you're a single blue shirt or you're moving overseas, you aren't entitled."

If you do that they might check you off of leave and put you into a duty status, which you may not want. If you'd be cutting it close if you don't check in early then I'd agree with BGW to avoid travel advances. Advances come from an era where you used cash or checks to pay for everything.  For most moves I just put things on a credit card and paid it back as soon as I got reimbursed by PSD, although I have taken advance DLA when I knew I'd be entitled to it at the ultimate duty station.  One thing you may want to research is whether privatized base housing counts as government quarters for the purposes of DLA. I don't think it does (i.e. I think you'd be entitled to DLA) but it's a very expensive mistake if you or the PSDs get it wrong."

navy,38cx0m,Captainrathgar,3,Wed Jun 3 12:14:55 2015 UTC,"Anybody reservist with a horror story about getting deployed should have reconsidered joining the reserve, since that is sort of the primary purpose of the reserve. You will probably be sheltered from deployment for a while though since you're getting off of active duty and there is usually a lengthy ""dwell time"" during which you won't be deployed (I forget how they calculate it off the top of my head).  I was a drilling reservist while going to school and I didn't find it to be unmanageable. There are often being annoying admin tasks, GMT-related stuff, etc. that can take up some time, but it's really not that bad. Certainly less time-invasive than active duty and the ""one weekend a month-two weeks a year"" rule is the standard. Some units will have different drill schedules but overall you are only on the hook for the drill weekends and one two-week training period.  As far as rates go, I was also an intel rate and so that's all I can really comment on, but it seemed like the intel ratings are better suited for the drill weekends since you can actually get some work done if you have the time. Often times it will feel like your only job is admin, so there's that. Other rates might see little in the way of actually ""doing your job"" on the weekend, but a lot of this also has to do with the individual units.  Other advantages: the weekend pay is usually not substantial, but it's something, and you can often make decent money during the two-week annual Training Period (especially if you qualify for per diem); you retain base privileges, commissary access, etc.; you continue to work toward retirement; you can seek out deployment opportunities if/when you want to (or when your dwell time expires the Navy can seek you out for them).  Let me know if you have other questions. It's hard to make general statements about ""reserve life"" since a lot of it depends on your unit and your NOSC. Be prepared for a much different Navy experience than you are accustomed to, however."

We actually didn't know what it was that caused the clog for three days. We kept snaking it; we could feel resistance but were unable to figure out why we couldn't retrieve the clog. Apparently, when you snake such rotund citruses you basically just puncture holes in it.  After three days of blowing the line, snaking it, blowing it from the other direction in hopes that we might spew whatever was flushed back into the face of the individual responsible, we decided our only recourse was to remove a foot of 4"" diameter piping. We were trying to avoid that because we didn't have any unions or other 4"" pipe on hand, only on order. After performing some fantastic pipe surgery, we retrieved the grapefruit. It had more holes than a porcupine's underwear.  To sort of apologize for The Great Grapefruit Incident, their Gunny gave us three marines TAD every deployment/workup after that for the next two years. (Bless him.)"

The water parks are nice, just the whole burkini thing was...different. I bought one as a souvenir but now I use it almost all the time when SCUBA diving.   MWR has some awesome trips. We always went to the resort trip--there's one where they have a giant floating bar in the pool, and you can walk out of the pool (gentle incline up to the sand) and run across the hot sand into the ocean. But swimming around the pool and deciding to pop up next to the bar and grab a shot was probably the most unique drinking experience of my life.   The Gold Suk is fun to poke around in as well.

navy,389r1x,club41,9,Tue Jun 2 20:39:06 2015 UTC,"Do you never look at your pay?  When you're not at sea or living on board, you're eligible for BAS (basic allowance for subsistence), so that you can pay for food. It's $367 per month. At sea or if you live on board etc they take that money back.  If you're not showing both receiving and losing BAS, talk to your yeoman or PSD."
navy,389r1x,daimii,20,Tue Jun 2 21:04:35 2015 UTC,"Further explanation because I'm bored at work and pay/food is something I think everyone should have a basic understanding of, especially since people bitch about the Navy's food so much.  The Navy sets a BDFA for you, Basic Daily Food Allowance. It's based on 3 meals a day and your geographic region. There's a whole chart, but the CONUS average is $10.44. That's $10 to feed one sailor, three meals a day.  There are requirements on the meals, such as lunch/dinner must have 2 protein options. Example: Fried Chicken and Lemon-baked Pollock. One option can be whatever, the other must be ""healthy"" (<10g fat per serving). Then there's a starch, like rice, potatoes, etc. And at least 2 vegetables. There must (when possible) be a salad bar with at least 6 toppings, and soup, and bread, and a desert.  Quick math tells you that an SSBN like mine has about 180 sailors on board. That's $1879 per day to create 3 meals (midrats is not included, which is why it's supposed to be leftovers) for 180 sailors. Granted, we feed an average of 90 for breakfast, 130 for lunch, and 120 for dinner. So... 340 individual meals.  Because I'm still super bored... boneless pork loin (for bbq sandwiches) is $2.39/lb wholesale, per Sysco Seattle (Bremerton/Bangor vendor). I typically use 40lbs of pork, knowing that the starch is Mac and Cheese and I'll have leftovers to make BBQ Pork Mac. That's $100 worth of pork, and we still have breakfast, the rest of lunch, and dinner to consider. Then I'll typically make something fresh for midrats, ravioli, beef stew, jalapeno poppers, mozzarella sticks... and that funding literally doesn't exist. Plus, it's not just a ""use the money where you need it;"" there is a breakdown for each meal. Of that $1800/day, it's split 20/40/40 over the 3 meals. Granted, there's usually a bit left over, and that gets rolled into those midrats and any special meals (Christmas, Navy Birthday, etc).  This, of course, is for a small ship underway and doesn't include the wardroom, where they are billed separately. It doesn't include shore galleys where money is actually collected. There are a ton of other factors at play here.  Back on topic, though. BAS is important, and so is the Navy taking it back from you when you're at sea or eating/living on board. You should (ideally, but I don't always) be checking your LES monthly to make sure you aren't being over- or under-paid, because both will suck in their own ways.  EDIT: Wow, didn't expect the gold, thank you so much."

I pulled out my old les to compare to his and I see I got comrats (commuted rations) when I was in port and didn't when underway. It didn't show up as a grant and deduction, so now that is a bit clearer. I think part of his issue is now with Navy Federal doing some kind of overdraft protection. He should have gotten ~$700 this paycheck and it only shows a deposit of 150. That's what we're trying to figure out now. Again, I appreciate the explanation. 😊"
navy,389r1x,daimii,3,Wed Jun 3 03:57:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, I didn't get the background on it. BAS for him is essentially the same as comrats was for you, we still refer to it as comrats.  On another note, I want to say it's great that you're watching out for him while he's out to sea. Thank you for that, he's got enough on his plate without having to worry about things back home."

They usually indicate start/stop of entitlements and also any indebtedness (if, say, he has been collecting BAS since he got to the ship and the navy just caught it)  As a YN this is a great training opportunity for him.....I can't tell you how many times I've had to call admin/PSD to get a breakdown of my or one of my sailor's LESes.  So if you guys don't figure it out, have him ask his LPO for a crash course in how to read the les and all the codes at the bottom.....he can look up his pay/LES codes in the computer too and probably watch as his YN1 or YNC shows him how to fix it."

There are no medals/ribbons on the BDUs. Even if there were, this person is not benefiting from them in any way. Also, The BDU is a phased out uniform.  This person is a civilian.

navy,385u1c,daimii,2,Tue Jun 2 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying either of them are right.   I'm just saying it's probably not ""stolen valor"" or any of a number of things we might accuse them of.   If she was prior service, the worst thing she could be guilty of is not providing a good example for her adult son. Her uniform items are hers, and she can wear them how and whenever she chooses. Oh wait, do the uniform regs or UCMJ say not to do this? Neither of those apply to her anymore. No, it's not in good taste, but that's all.  If she was not, she probably got the uniform items at a thrift shop or military surplus store. Guess what: that's not illegal either.  What are you going to do, call the cops? What would they possibly do about something that is A. not illegal, and B. only slightly offensive to people in the military?  It's just not worth getting worked up over."

navy,384hf2,SuperNixon,32,Mon Jun 1 20:07:33 2015 UTC,"Can't we stop focusing on recruiting certain groups and instead just put good sailors in the fleet? I'm not saying there aren't women out there doing amazing work, but at what point can we stop seeing men/women, black/white, and start seeing good sailors?  I would just as happily work in a 50/50 workplace, or one with all women, or all men, provided they are all there to work hard and accomplish the mission. Gender is really irrelevant to me at that point. For some reason Naval leadership has made it their mission to prioritize women as a percentage, and I feel like it's going to backfire. I want a fully integrated fleet, but not at the expense or readiness.   Let's not shoe-horn women into rates they don't want just to fill a quota."
navy,384hf2,daimii,5,Mon Jun 1 22:37:20 2015 UTC,Do you think having a higher percentage of women in the workplace will decrease sexual harrassment and hostile working environments and increase equality?
navy,384hf2,TheBeneGesseritWitch,4,Tue Jun 2 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"In the endgame, yes.  It's going to take time. It's going to take scandals, smudges, embarrassments, masts, examples. Time. But yes, in the end it will reduce the negative aspects, all of them.  You can see it in the short integration of the submarine force. We aren't even at enlisted yet and we've lost sailors to fraternization (Ohio or Michigan, I can't remember) and harassment (the Wyoming video case). Any process of altering the balance of men and women will result in problems like this but when the scales balance I do believe we will have fewer problems.  As women become a larger part of the fleet, manning-wise, men will form healthier relationships (close friends/sisters) and it will lead to more of the Navy's favorite ""bystander intervention"" and overall increased awareness. For so many sailors, issues like sexism assault and harassment are classroom issues, not real world. This push will bring it more real world for them."

We're culturally conditioned to be focused on raw statistics, so much so that we end up ignoring the important information that's right in front of our faces. Engineering, computer science, politics, all white-male dominated fields, all with big pushes to get female and minority (I really hate that word but can't think of a better synonym right now) involvement.  While it is important to improve the diversity of our fleet, and it will most likely improve the effectiveness of our sailors, filling gaps with people to meet quotas doesn't help the mission; it is nothing more than degrading to those who are seen simply as statistics by the brass."

navy,384hf2,floppybutton,-7,Tue Jun 2 00:18:08 2015 UTC,"Taking away their BAH isn't ridiculous, it's supposed to provide for a place to live, not be additional pay. Pay is taxable, while BAH isn't.  So if you have two married sailors getting 1500 a month for BAH, that means the government is paying 3k for something that's supposed to cost them 1500. So what's happening is they're paying the 1500 for a place and pocketing the rest. That's not the intention of the money at all. It's just an old system tgetting finally updated."
navy,384hf2,TheBeneGesseritWitch,5,Tue Jun 2 01:40:34 2015 UTC,"A few points to consider:   I do the same job as my husband. I am entitled to the same monetary compensation that he is. This new bill makes him my dependent. How is that fair? If you find a place under your BAH, or have a roommate or spouse who pays for part or all of housing, by your logic, you shouldn't be entitled to bah either.  A mil-mil couple actually saves the government money. If we both married civilians we'd be collecting bah at dependent rate. If we are unmarried, we both collect bah at single rate. Why should I be penalized because I married another sailor? Marriage should have nothing whatsoever to do with BAH."
navy,384hf2,BurningBushes2000,4,Tue Jun 2 00:55:41 2015 UTC,So two single sailors who live together and share a place will be given 75% of their bah rate. Is that fair?
navy,384hf2,BurningBushes2000,-3,Tue Jun 2 04:02:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on the arrangement, if they're roommates in a lease together one should get BAH and the other not, if they're both renting a room then they should both get it.  It's not fair to the government to have to pay 2x the price of a place."
navy,384hf2,BurningBushes2000,5,Tue Jun 2 01:05:53 2015 UTC,"So if they are both renting a room that is fair but because my spouse is married to me, I face a pay cut? Fuck that. That is bullshit."
navy,384hf2,BurningBushes2000,-2,Tue Jun 2 01:21:55 2015 UTC,Why should the government pay twice for a place?
navy,384hf2,SurfaceEngineer,3,Tue Jun 2 01:27:38 2015 UTC,Because BAH is part of what is called RMC (regular military compensation).  http://militarypay.defense.gov/pay/index.html  To take it away from one service member and give them disproportionate pay is wrong and discriminatory.
navy,384hf2,BlackSquirrel05,-5,Tue Jun 2 02:50:41 2015 UTC,"Allowances are the second most important element of military pay. Allowances are moneys provided for specific needs, such as food or housing.   Exactly, you don't have a specific need for housing pay if they are already paying your spouse for it. It's not discriminatory if they're paying your wife/husband."
navy,384hf2,Poopkitty,3,Tue Jun 2 04:19:39 2015 UTC,"Actually yes it is. Because we are both doing equal work and one of us will be losing out on our allowance.   Allowance is part of your military compensation and benefits package.   You think it's fair that as an O-3E with 14 years of service that I make less than an E-4 living off base with his buddies?   Aside from the fact that this will drive officers out in a mass exodus, I don't think it actually has any chance of making it through the house.   I will make less. My wife's income might be higher but mine won't be. It isn't fair and it is disproportionate.  The only argument I ever hear against dual mil bah is that they make too much money. AKA people are being haters. It is ridiculous. You know how much sacrifice it takes to make a dual mil marriage work?"
navy,384hf2,TheBeneGesseritWitch,-3,Tue Jun 2 04:28:34 2015 UTC,"Your entire argument is WAAAAAAAAAAAAA i don't get paid enough. Literally like you said, that money is supposed to be used for specific things, and you are getting that need already paid for.  I don't see what the big issue is here."

navy,384hf2,TheBeneGesseritWitch,-1,Mon Jun 1 21:23:40 2015 UTC,"I can't find the original data, i hope someone can find it.  Edit, odds are there is a lower retention rate for females and they seem to thin out at the higher ranks."
navy,384hf2,Belvyzep,2,Mon Jun 1 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely correct, and for a whole lot of reasons.    It's very difficult to find a partner who is comfortable with their wife doing this job. I have had (and /u/TheBeneGesseritWitch now has) Sailors who will not complete their 20 years because their household is not equal despite the fact that they are also Sailors. Female Sailors who cook, clean, do 85% of childrearing, all of the laundry and still work full time.  It is difficult for a parent to leave their children, and since pregnancy is detrimental to one's career (traditionally) women tend to be the ones to get out and stay home. Pregnancy has an adverse effect on a career. Even though an eval cannot say outright - I have seen it - ""Transferring from USS Fitzgerald on the occasion of her pregnancy;""  and it is easy to read between the lines anyway. I have lost good Sailors to PTS and C-Way because pregnancy held them back. I hear sexist shit every damn day. EVERY DAY. It's tiring, and it's bullshit, and it's perpetuated under the guise of ""history"" and ""tradition."" It wears on a person.    I will look, because the data exists.  Edit: Found it. http://are.berkeley.edu/~jperloff/PDF/promotion.pdf Specifically page 21, section B. ""Males are substantially more likely to be promoted than females in the lower pay grades (up to E5). Females are more likely than males to stay in the Navy at E4, but are less likely at E5 and E6. The overall probabilities of promotion and retention fell for both sexes from the peace to the war periods."""
navy,384hf2,TheBeneGesseritWitch,3,Mon Jun 1 20:54:29 2015 UTC,"Yes! The BIG FAT LIE that women must do everything all by ourselves.    We must keep house--cook, clean, laundry, dishes, all that is on us, not our husbands.  We must do our jobs well.  We must take care of the children. Most of the female sailors I know with children ARE responsible for most of the childrearing--they get them ready in the morning, take them to day care, pick them up, feed them, clean them, entertain them, all while trying to get dinner on the table, lunch packed for the next day, and dishes washed....while their husbands come home and play video games. One of my sailors came to work fuming because her husband said to her, ""I just married a pretty face. You don't clean and you're a terrible cook.""    There's a huge gender disparity and expectation here. Shortly after the birth of our child, I told my husband that we are equal partners in all things. If he wants me to do all the cooking, all the cleaning, and be the primary caregiver for our child--I get to be a stay at home mom. Otherwise, we're in this together, and we are equally responsible for all things, together. We do the same job at work, we share the same responsibilities at the home. Unfortunately, most couples do not have this understanding, and it is so draining. It's a terrible, sad thing when women say ""I look forward to my duty days because it's the only time I get to relax.""  All your other points are very valid, too. But the first one is really, really, on point."
navy,384hf2,TheBeneGesseritWitch,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:33:27 2015 UTC,They're going to put more women into the terrible work environment that's our fleet and then incentivize pregnancy even more. Does anyone else see this plan ending terribly?
navy,384hf2,somerandomguy1232,10,Tue Jun 2 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"For the record, it isn't incentivizing, it's aligning with federal standard.   Also, I'll have to find the data when I'm not on mobile, but iirc the percentage of men removed from sea duty due to injury is higher than the percentage of women who get pregnant. Truthfully, I think the reason women get out isn't because of how we are treated regarding pregnancy or benefits/rights, but simply put, leaving your child is hard. It's harder for women, I think. I feel like I could write an essay on that, but suffice it to say once a woman gives birth going back to sea is a terrifying concept. I think that's why the numbers for women in senior ranks drop.   I do agree though that our work environment could be improved. I don't think any women with any common sense views the sheer work for 18 years that a child brings as ""easier"" than a few months of deployment though.  EDIT: Here's the data from the public.navy.mil website. It isn't that much higher, but it is higher: 11% male, 10% female due to pregnancy, 14% female due to other reasons are unplanned losses."
navy,384hf2,TheBeneGesseritWitch,0,Mon Jun 1 20:09:49 2015 UTC,"Im not gonna say that women are getting pregnant to get out of deployment, but I can count 5 females in the past 2 months who got off our ship because they were pregnant as our deployment date is coming up. The shitty part is that some of them were actually really good at their job, and now some divisions who've lost more than one sailor to pregnancy is hurting for sailors, let alone experienced ones."
navy,384hf2,TheBeneGesseritWitch,2,Mon Jun 1 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"And how many men have gotten moved off your ship due to injuries right before deployment? As you're not a yeoman-type, I'm really doubting you've got accurate data. There's a term for it, which I can't remember right now, something like perceptual vigilance....it's where you notice something after it's been pointed out. Well, it's been pointed out as ""fact"" that ""women get pregnant to get out of deployment."" So, as deployment approaches, everyone notices the sailors who get pregnant, even though the numbers are the same as during non deployment times, AND that more men are getting moved off the ship due to injury anyway. I know a lot of single women who got pregnant while at sea, and not any of them did it intentionally. More were upset about getting pregnant because it meant they capsized their careers.   So do me a favor, and go talk to your YNC and get the actual number of transfers, and reasons why, of ALL the sailors on your ship in the past two months."
navy,384hf2,Barrien,3,Mon Jun 1 23:42:35 2015 UTC,"Is confirmation bias the term you're looking for? I'm not sure that it's exactly what you were getting at, but I know that, in many cases, it is in full effect when it comes to things like women in the military getting pregnant at inopportune times."
navy,384hf2,TheBeneGesseritWitch,3,Tue Jun 2 00:11:58 2015 UTC,"YES! Thank you. That's exactly it.   Perceptual Vigilance is when you notice something after it's been pointed out. ""There are a lot of Jeeps on base."" and then noticing Jeeps at the Nex and commissary that afternoon.   Which kind of works, but I was definitely looking for the term confirmation bias."

I don't think any women with any common sense views the sheer work for 18 years that a child brings as ""easier"" than a few months of deployment though.   It's not a matter of ""easier"" it's a matter of choosing to do it at that moment. They know that they want children anyways, and why not pick the absolute best time to have them?"
navy,384hf2,BlackSquirrel05,0,Tue Jun 2 07:51:47 2015 UTC,"This is old data, but the most current available from public.navy.mil.  It is true that the overall numbers for women lost are higher. Total, 25% of women are unplanned losses, but more than half of those unplanned losses are not due to pregnancy. Only 11% are due to pregnancy. Total, 10% of men are unplanned losses. When taking pregnancy out of the equation, the numbers are quite close at 14% female, 10% male. Since the navy is only 18% female, the actual numbers show way more men are unplanned losses than women. So why do we only notice the pregnant women leaving?"
navy,384hf2,BlackSquirrel05,2,Tue Jun 2 00:15:16 2015 UTC,"I think one of thy big problems is how the Navy handles rotation in this case. Sure I've lost males to injury for 3-6 months, but if it was longer I got a replacement. The two times a female in my division got pregnant we got told by the detailers that we were just gonna be short for two years and suck it up."

OP, take a look at Imperial Beach Gardens and Mariners' Point- those were the 2 complexes I lived in. There's also plenty of small rental type places there, just keep in mind that the closer you get to the pier the longer it'll have been since it was updated."

navy,38523x,The_Duckster,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:27:53 2015 UTC,If you have savings and can afford it - consider purchasing a home. If you are stationed in IB some of the closer areas where newer properties are developing include eastlake and its surrounding areas.  It would help alot if you were more descriptive as in what it important to you and what resources you possess.  IE i am an E5 and wife is stay at home mom (IB is fine) much different than i am a LT and wife is a licensed medical practitioner.(consider del mar or la jolla) I am a senior chief and wife works in a csi type duty for sherriffs dept. We live in the la mesa area which is middle of the road...not a dump but its not ritzy first class living.  Also important like  Kids are preschool age want something with parks nearby. Kids are in high school want my kid on a good sports team (name sport someone will tell you where best teams are) Etc etc  Also on the silver strand there is some very nice Navy housing - if you are willing to live in navy housing - it is in my opinion the best navy housing in san diego area (i think it is e6-e9 only) that is located very close to imperial beach.
navy,38523x,succaneers,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"If you want to live close to beach  Ocean beach and imperial beach and some parts of mission beach are lowest priced beach living. Pacific beach is more expensive but obviously nicer. La jolla and del mar and coronado most expensive but best of beach living.  If you want to live inland far east but within reasonable driving distance includes old west...small town kinda feel - santee and some parts of el cajon, further commute - julian and alpine.  You will find great prices on nicer homes if you are willing to drive 1.5 to 2.5 hours a day includes escondido temecula marietta and the surrounding areas.  Oceanside is too far for the price when oceanside is just like imperial beach.  The close surrounding areas to imperial beach at reasonable prices - southeast san diego which includes: Nicer la mesa. point loma.  linda vista. bonita Medium clairemont. Clairemont mesa. Kearney mesa. Spring valley. Lemon grove. chula vista. especially east of 805. West of 805 there are some nice neighborhoods and some rough areas.  Some ghetto spots but also some nice gems to be found in national city. I would avoid national city and anything in the san ysidro area. Its close to your work. But thats like the only advantages.  If you are a hipster family consider hillcrest or mission hills area.  If you find something you are interested in and want more info....pm me or something but i warn u i am brutally honest and its one guys opinion.

If you want to go downtown or anywhere for fun, it is 40+ minutes away. If you don't take the strand home, the i5 south is a nightmare heading south at rush hour.   Eastlake is okay. It is cheap but again the distance from everything. I would recommend living somewhere else."

This is actually a really quiet part of San Diego.  If you look at the crime rates IB has less crime the Coronado and Poway, two of the ""nicest"" areas of San Diego.   The distance/traffic is never really a problem unless you are coming from past downtown. It takes me about 10-15 min to get home each day from 32nd.   Like I said in another part of this thread, I don't understand all the hate for Chula Vista, South San Diego and IB. Is it because it's close to Mexico?

navy,38324p,jodobrowo,7,Mon Jun 1 14:27:13 2015 UTC,"You choose between the MGIB and Post 9/11 when you apply for benefits through the VA. If you're not going directly to school, I would wait to apply until after you separate, as it asks for your active duty status and if you elect the Post 9/11 it can delay your housing stipend (since you can't receive it while on active duty and it takes some time for them to process the change of status after you separate). I chose the P9/11 because it fit my situation. This is going to vary by person, there's no right answer. The general advice I could give you is this: If you're attending a cheap state school, you could potentially pocket more money with the MGIB. If you're attending as an out-of-state resident or going to a school with high tuition, the P9/11 almost always wins (as it pays your tuition, and you pocket the housing stipend). You'll need to figure out what school you want to go to, and see what their tuition is. Then calculate which would give you more money after tuition is paid. You have 10 years to use the MGIB after separating, and 15 for the P9/11."

My community details aren't loading right now at home, but the Navy is currently not accepting convert-out (sailors trying to get out of ND into another rate). It's not pegged as CREO 1 (undermanned) though, so I think it's probably somewhere between 95-105% full, considering ""manned."" I can't tell you what to expect, that's a better question for /u/NSWMotivator, he's a Special Warfare Motivator. As far as waiting, it's a pretty constant process. There will be waiting in any Navy community, some more than others. You'll probably get through the process with a ship date for boot camp in the fall sometime (expect Sept-Nov I would guess), then I believe you head to TSC Great Lakes for the first part of your school, then onto A school. At each of these stops you'll have a couple of weeks waiting to ""class up"" where they'll hold a group of you until enough arrive to fill a class. Most Navy schools it's about 2 weeks, but I've seen a few at over a month. Apparently the process is now... go to MEPS and sign a ""placeholder"" rate with a long ship date, pass your PST with a SO Motivator, go back and sign for ND and adjust your ship date. You no longer have the option to request a PST at boot camp, they stopped doing that a little while ago. Again, talk to /u/NSWMotivator about the PST, but you'll need to run, pushups, situps, pullups, and swim at competitive levels to gain a contract. The best way, if you know you want it, is to go through boot as a prospective ND. You could go to the fleet as another rate and try to crossrate, but you open up to a lot of factors at that point; whether ND is open at your year-group (when you joined the Navy), whether your rate is accepting convert-outs for your year group (mine isn't), how you've performed at your command, and you'll be at least 2 years older."

This is one of the tricky areas regarding OCS. Unfortunately, there's no way to tell. My wife had already quit her job and was ready to move to Pensacola when we got word that I was on OHARP duty in SC until class started in FL (5 months later). My best advice is to planing not being together and then, if things work, you can move in with.   The Navy may not pay for you or your furniture to be moved until after he graduated from school, so finding storage or moving yourself could end up being on your own dime. Both from home to Rhode Island, then from Rhode Island to his ultimate duty station."

We've already been on separate continents for over 2 years, so It's exciting that he'll be back stateside and we can finally live together (even for a short time) It's getting hard to be patient! Also nerve wracking since we really won't know what's going to happen till it's basically happening.  Do you know around what part of OCS they find out where they're going next?  I'm already planning a DIY move since our little bit of stuff (we're literally starting from scratch aside from clothes and a dresser or two) is still in 2 separate houses, and work isn't an issue for me to just pick up and go whenever, so we're good there. Basically we're just ready to live together even for a few months (I'd be going up there even if he has a wait before school starts) and willing to pay for it.

navy,3840r8,Nusselt,2,Sat Jun 6 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure - I was one of the guys who graduated and went. If those staying in Newport were given accommodations at the Navy Inn or a separate barracks (I doubt it, but maybe) I wouldn't know. But, if it all goes as you say, once he reaches Candio phase, you could always see if funds support you house hunting a bit. Looking for an apartment or house for you two to stay in, then planning a move in date for the day he graduates. That way he can go straight from OCS to a house with his wife. Once again, advisable only once he's in Candio phase, you two know when he'll graduate, and you have the funds available.  Edit - OHARP was an option we were given in the last week of OCS. He might not have it available, he may. If you guys want to take it, this depends on if you still want to earn money at home while you guys see family before leaving for a long time. No Supply guys were offered it while I was there, but if his school is that backed up it may be an option. Once again, OCS is really a big crapshoot with how things are going to turn out. Single guys have it easy since they're flexible - married couples usually get frustrated a time or two."

navy,381h61,donheart,2,Mon Jun 1 04:05:06 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll be that guy.  How effective/necessary are the Amphibs in today's world? I realize that our Marines and their effective deployment is our best ground-fighting ability, but how much do we really need that? We aren't fighting the same ground wars that we were 70, 50, or even 30 years ago.  I understand how a carrier provides projection of power, both at sea and inland, and I understand the roles of the submarine force and smaller ships like destroyers. Maybe I just don't understand, but I have a hard time seeing the role of amphibs today."
navy,381h61,daimii,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:44:31 2015 UTC,I agree. Most a fib landings are via helos now anyways.
navy,381h61,Blacktempllar,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:55:23 2015 UTC,"A modern amphib is kind of like a swiss army knife, they provide logistic support to a small squadron and aircraft, act as a base-ship for assault troops its own unique strike capability, has significant C4ISR capabilities (LPD-17 has a c2 suite similar to aircraft carrier) the last five years have seen a massive investment globally of large deck amphibs. They are also evolving past simply being a assualt transport and more into a capital ship role."
navy,381h61,philbob84,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:14:38 2015 UTC,"At what point then does a well equipped amphib begin to take the place of the supercarrier as a projection of power? It doesn't have the same massive stature, but as you describe can actually be more capable as a warfighting machine. Could we be seeing a long term plan to scale back our carrier fleet in favor of using amphibs as capital ships?"
navy,381h61,daimii,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:40:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say its more capable but its sufficient for 80% of missions at 25% the cost (this is just for the LHAR(R) im personally very excieted after reading about LHA-8's design changes... it gets even better for LX(R) theoretically and economically ...) and probably sooner then later, people are already asking where the nearest MEU is. Combined with advances in Rotor craft CH-53K and H/MV-22B/C plus the JSF; provides ample capability, more then enough in most situations. The biggest change culturally will be accepting 25 knots is ok. On this subject I think we should acutally be thinking smaller and consider brining back the LST, both the Koreans and the Turks are designing impressive modern LST and if not that at least a smaller amphib along the lines of the Thai/Singapore Endurance LPD or Indonesian/Peruvian/Filipino Makassar class"
navy,381h61,philbob84,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:46:33 2015 UTC,"25 knots is ok   Too slow or too fast? (I'm a boomer guy, so ~1 knot is good)  I saw that clip of the JSF landing vertically on the deck of an LHA (I think). Seemed in that one moment we're almost making carriers extinct to an extent. We no longer have amphibs with Harriers that are limited in their fighter roles, we finally have a true multirole fighter that can operate well from an amphib deck, and to me that seemed like a huge deal."
navy,381h61,daimii,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:11:21 2015 UTC,Traditionally it has been considered to slow based of tactics established by the fast carrier groups of ww2.  However many of our peers don't seem to have a problem with the slower speeds with their warships. Type 45 ddg has a top reported speed of only 27 and cvf only 25. I personally share a similar opinion with you of the jsf I don't think they are all needed but the stvol version is a game changer.we could double out carrier fleet with them.

According to the ESWS instruction, OPNAVINST 1414.8 (which, as a YN3 select you should learn how to find the actual instructions; doni.daps is a good place to start.) You have 30 months to qualify, and that's pretty nonegotiable.   According to the BUPERSINST 1610.10C you can't just ""postpone an eval.""  Part of me wants to tell you that ""you waited nearly three years to get a qual that can be earned in a few months of serious dedication, I'm not sure you're ready for the greater responsibilities that your new appointment carries with it"" and the other part of me wishes I could give you that loophole you're looking for....I guess the biggest defense you could have is that an adverse eval requires justification, and without that page 13 they might (might) be hard pressed to provide any justification.

I would be excited about BAH not being abused to get a small subset of sailors extra pay; I'd rather that we simply all get the extra pay (i.e. by increasing base pay and/or retention bonuses to adjust for the loss of housing overage), instead of a select group who manage to bring in the dual-BAH windfall."
navy,37wdok,mpyne,7,Sun May 31 13:47:05 2015 UTC,There's a huge difference between this O-6 committing fraud (my office just got someone convicted for exactly what you describe) and two sailors both getting paid the same regardless of whether their spouse works for the military or for a civilian employer.
navy,37wdok,JCY2K,-1,Sun May 31 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"two sailors both getting paid the same regardless of whether their spouse works for the military or for a civilian employer   That's my point all along though: it's already not true that two sailors get ""paid the same"".  Case 1: In the barracks, married to a different sailor who has also opted to stay in barracks for now. Neither get BAH at all.  Case 2: Same exact sailor, married to same exact other sailor, both live off base in separate residences, both get BAH-single. Good so far, and approximately the same as Case 1 since the BAH each gets is, in theory, going to offset the cost of housing+utilities+frustration associated with being a renter.  Case 3: Same exact sailor, married to same exact other sailor, both live off base in 1 residence of equivalent quality (though larger) to the 2 residences they'd lived in before. As it stands today they would each pull in BAH-single, which combines for much more than the BAH w/ depns that is used to pay for this same scenario with any other sailor.  They are each making much more money on this arrangement than the same sailors in Case 1, because these are the only sailors in all 3 of these cases whose income from the ""housing allowance"" exceeds the costs of housing even in theory.  So even with the current rules there are sailors who would get paid differently, and that's not even getting into how we treat housing overseas or on TDY (which we've discussed elsewhere this thread :). And there's, right now, only 1 type of sailor guaranteed to get paid more and that's the MIL-MIL sailor living in the same residence."
navy,37wdok,mpyne,8,Sun May 31 16:42:13 2015 UTC,I just wanted to point out that the crime of fraud is radically different than people thinking the current system is unfair.
navy,37wdok,JCY2K,1 point,Sun May 31 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's very true. I'm not trying to insinuate that taking advantage of the system as it's setup is the same as defrauding it... just that I would lose a lot less sleep over a loophole getting closed as I would about a rule actually designed to penalize someone."
navy,37wdok,mpyne,2,Sun May 31 19:01:34 2015 UTC,"It's not ""opted to,"" it is according to the JTR that sailor living out of the BEQ isn't allowed until you're an E6 on sea duty or an E7 on shore duty!  The problem with the instruction as it is written is those junior sailors married to a servicemember are treated as individual single sailors! I don't get any of the benefits of marrying a civilian until I earn it because of my rank! That's why I'm so heated about them taking it away from me!"
navy,37wdok,mpyne,0,Mon Jun 1 01:05:45 2015 UTC,"I said 'opted' in this case because they're married. Per JTR Table 10C-1, MIL-MIL spouses are 'normally' authorized BAH/OHA if not assigned family-type government quarters, even if single quarters are available (or in other words allowed to leave barracks to bunk together out on the town).  This might be different for 7th Fleet, and JTR uses the weasel word 'normally' here. But I've never heard of married junior sailors confined to barracks; e.g. even at Nuclear Power School our married students lived out in town, and the Marines seem to do that too if Terminal Lance is anything to judge by. Are they allowed to confine married E5s to the barracks at your duty station? (If so, that sucks, but that sucks even without Sen. McCain's bill...).  I actually kept reading just to see and the section dealing with BAH for single members seems to say that a member married to another member (even below E-6) is authorized BAH, effective since 2013. (10400E4, in case you need to show PSD...)  In this case it's actually a good deal that neither is a dependent of the other because they then both get BAH instead of just one. But I see what you're talking about in that there's a lot more restrictions on a ""member without dependents"" (i.e. the MIL-MIL couples). But JTR has always been that way, someone else has already mentioned DLA.  I will say I have been somewhat swayed by the argument that it doesn't make sense to treat a MIL-MIL couple just like a MIL-CIV couple, since they both serve. I.e. ""BAH with dependent"" is a misnomer, the MIL spouse actually serving surely deserves something better than CIV spouse. Maybe they could offer BAH-Diff to the spouse who doesn't get BAH. But as it stands 2x BAH single for 1 place is a scam, always has been, so I'm not surprised to see them go after it finally."

If the answer is that she'd get out then that means her pay is too low, not her housing allowance. The solution to that is to increase base pay, not abuse a housing allowance by policy."
navy,37wdok,club41,0,Tue Jun 2 23:44:00 2015 UTC,"Well, it took me, and Mr. BGW and his CMC, and the housing director having a (as we say in the south) ""come'ta Jesus meetin'"" before they gave us both our entitlements. They originally refused us base housing (because your husband doesn't count in your family composition since he's active duty) and they had him in a BEQ as a resident advisor.   I thought I was seriously gonna lose my mind when the housing director told him ""well, since I sign the papers that PSD needs to start your pay, I'm really the final authority on if you get OHA or not and I don't see why I should give it to you."" (He's e6 at sea mind you)  Mil-mil have way fewer rights than single sailors because we trade them to be with our spouse. We don't get the benefits of a mil-civ  relationship either.   anyway, like you said, the operative word is ""normally,"" and I've seen dual mil sailors both put in the BEQ. Granted that was years ago, so I'm glad to see they've changed it.   I wouldn't be opposed to bah-diff. That's a reasonable compromise....I still want my money though."

navy,37wdok,celsius032,15,Sun May 31 00:38:45 2015 UTC,"As a single service member, I'm entitled to BAH, even if my spouse works and makes plenty of money. My officemate is married to a servicemember. He and I do the same job, are the same rank and have the same time in service. He and I should get the same compensation.  When I marry a civilian later this year, I'll be making more than him which is unfair. I'm pro uncoupling BAH from marriage status but saying ""oh your spouse works for us too, we are going to cut your compensation"" is unreasonable and will drive people away."
navy,37wdok,HBHT9,6,Sun May 31 01:08:31 2015 UTC,"That compensation is there solely to get us housing. If our housing situation is covered then we shouldn't expect to continue to receive it.

It's a completely imbalanced system."
navy,37wdok,justatouchcrazy,7,Sun May 31 01:19:37 2015 UTC,If this stipend is solely for housing then why does it go up as we get promoted? Just because you get promoted suddenly you need a bigger place?

navy,37wdok,HBHT9,3,Sun May 31 03:13:49 2015 UTC,There is a pretty lengthy PDF on exactly how and why BAH is calculated. Too lazy to find it right now but the TLDR is that the Navy assumes certain life milestones for each rank. Like an E4 is either single or getting engaged. E5 might be starting a family. E6 probably has 1-2 kids. So they pay goes up to compensate for what are normal life milestones.
navy,37wdok,herosavestheday,2,Sun May 31 17:01:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think that matches up all that much anymore, though. So many older people are joining the ranks. And I don't think it's fair for the Navy to make those judgement calls anyway. If it's going to be a stipend like BAS (which never changes) then make it so. But if it's going to increase JUST LIKE our pay, then I will use it however I see fit."
navy,37wdok,mpyne,2,Sun May 31 17:28:02 2015 UTC,"It still matches up with the median sailor which is what the calculation is based on so the demographics haven't shifted THAT much. It is absolutely the Navy's job how to calculate a fair way to provide housing, not sure why you think it's not their ""judgement call"" to make. I think they should just make it like OHA where the service member doesn't get to keep what is leftover."
navy,37wdok,mpyne,1 point,Sun May 31 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"I think they should just make it like OHA where the service member doesn't get to keep what is leftover.   I think it would make sense to split the difference between actual cost and the cap with the servicemember. Otherwise sailors would just get the absolute most expensive apartment or house they could find since the bill would be the same to them anyways (same reason my parents always turned the thermostat to crazy things in base housing... ""why not, it's not like we're paying the bill"")."
navy,37wdok,ProfShea,2,Mon Jun 1 00:03:56 2015 UTC,"Just because you get promoted suddenly you need a bigger place?   Need, no. But you'd be thought to rate a bigger place, plus that helps scale somewhat with a growing family in a servicemembers career.  Changing social mores since BAH was defined will pretty much eliminate the ""I'm an E6 and rate a better place than an E4"" I think, but as you can see with the reaction to this proposal it's basically impossible to change revise anything in BAH down once it's instituted..."
navy,37wdok,JCY2K,1 point,Sun May 31 13:31:26 2015 UTC,The same reason that housing for officers and enlisted is different. Different ranks gets different housing. It's not hard to understand.
navy,37wdok,club41,7,Sun May 31 18:03:55 2015 UTC,"So if my civilian spouse makes enough to pay for our housing, I shouldn't get BAH?"
navy,37wdok,JCY2K,3,Sun May 31 01:36:46 2015 UTC,Is the gov't providing a housing allowance to your spouse also?
navy,37wdok,herosavestheday,5,Sun May 31 03:13:05 2015 UTC,"No, they get a salary that is sufficient to cover all their expenses, including housing."
navy,37wdok,mpyne,4,Sun May 31 03:40:33 2015 UTC,Then that is a separate argument. As it stands BAH is there to provide housing. It gets treated by us service members but it's not income.
navy,37wdok,JCY2K,3,Sun May 31 16:58:03 2015 UTC,"That's actually how it works overseas, and on TDY travel.  BAH is the exception, and it's only an exception because the logistics of implementing it like OHA or TDY housing were too difficult when BAH was added. PSDs would have imploded from all the paperwork needed."
navy,37wdok,mpyne,1 point,Sun May 31 07:44:03 2015 UTC,"TDY travel only works that way for less than 30 day trips. If you're TDY for 45 days, you get a flat rate per diem for housing but keep the difference between what you pay and the amount of the per diem."
navy,37wdok,ross549,2,Sun May 31 13:32:29 2015 UTC,"That's kind of changing too though, if it hasn't changed already... if you do long-term TDY you'll be limited to like 80% of housing cap or something like that, under the expectation that you'll find a short-term apartment (or get a cheaper multi-week hotel room) or something. Though it will be nice that they treat that like a true per diem, if that's still the case."
navy,37wdok,Amehunt,2,Sun May 31 16:07:50 2015 UTC,And it is not part of the standard pay package. It's an allowance. ;)
navy,37wdok,JCY2K,1 point,Sun May 31 16:10:26 2015 UTC,But it's part of the standard pay 'package'.  Live in the US?  You will get Base Pay + BAS + BAH + Special Bonuses = Pay Package.  It's not base pay but when you sign your contact with the military it's understood if you meet the basic requirements you will get BAH.  If you are going to effect people's BAH then you should effect everyone's not just the couples who are mil-mil.
navy,37wdok,ross549,1 point,Sun May 31 13:18:25 2015 UTC,Agreed (unsurprisingly). I think it's an allowance rather than just part of higher pay so they don't have to pay us as much (and thereby increase our tax liability [which would just go back into the general Treasury]).
navy,37wdok,flower1988,-2,Sun May 31 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but the simple fact that you are mil-mil does not mean you have a need to house more than one family."
navy,37wdok,JCY2K,2,Mon Jun 1 00:45:55 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not about pay, BAH is an allowance which is meant to provide you and a spouse with adequate housing. When a service member is married to a service member and they both receive BAH they essentially just double their housing allowance. You will both still get paid the same, because pay is only taxable income, BAH is only meant to cover living expenses."
navy,37wdok,flower1988,8,Mon Jun 1 02:48:07 2015 UTC,"We won't get paid the same, DFAS will put more money in my account than his."
navy,37wdok,Amehunt,0,Sun May 31 01:19:41 2015 UTC,"That is untaxable allowances... not your pay. Our pay is broken into sections. If you look at things narrowly you will always find a lot of things unjust, but if you identify what your paycheck is compiled of than you will see it more fairly."
navy,37wdok,mpyne,2,Sun May 31 01:37:45 2015 UTC,"So if that's true why don't families with 4 children receive more money then just a married couple?  And let's stop splitting hairs: you will not get ""paid the same"".  Are you married to a fellow military member? Before the bill: $4000 a month into your bank account; after $3000 a month into your account.  That is less money from your employer for one person in the couple."

It didn't drive people away when they were assigned to government family housing instead of being given BAH... this is how the military used to work, everywhere. It started shifting as a push to privatize the implementation of 'commercial activities' that the military had to engage in, but BAH was always supposed to be for housing, not part of your pay.  If people do start leaving because of this then the solution would be to increase pay or bonuses to meet retention goals, not to give MIL-MIL sailors (and only MIL-MIL sailors) a BAH gravy train."

navy,37wdok,MAK-15,0,Sun May 31 13:37:27 2015 UTC,"They're also targeted under this bill, as it turns out. They'd be limited to the greater of E4 BAH or 75% of their own BAH. Though they still get it better than MIL-MIL married, who I guess would be required to move in together (which is something I oppose in the bill).  Personally I think we should raise basic pay and then shift BAH to something more like OHA. It'll never happen because our personnel offices, PSDs and legal offices would all implode, but that's the 'more' fair thing to do.  As it stands today, even if you have BAH your actual compensation then depends on what kind of a housing deal you can scam rather than your rank and skills. I managed to get an incredible, absolutely stupendous deal on my current place because I happened to luck into finding a bored landlord who just wanted a quiet tenant and was willing to charge below-market rent to make that happen. So while that's great for me, and shifting to something like OHA would drop my income by a fairly decent chunk each month, I didn't do anything special to get that excess (and nor did the next guy who had to get something at market value do anything special to lose that excess).  Maybe a hybrid system would be better where sailors keep a portion of the difference between the cap and actual expenses to give them a reason to try to minimize costs. I had naïvely assumed that we were already trying to minimize costs to the taxpayers in general, but this whole thread has thoroughly disabused me of that notion."

It is an entitlement that certain sailors have earned based on rank to help compensate for the disparity between the civilian sector. The entitlements should be based on equal pay—for equal work. This proposal has removed the “equal pay” portion from the equation. It makes my military spouse “my dependent” when he does the same job I do. Two unmarried service members who are roommates can choose to leave their current housing arrangement and collect their full BAH. But because my roommate wears my ring, I am suddenly not eligible to the same benefit as my peers in the military—nor my spouse eligible to earn the same benefit as me. Yet, we are all the same rank, and do the same work.   You can't take away one person's entitlement just because they both work for the same company.

Never have I seen an older single sailor willing to put up with roommates. Besides that point though, it makes sense, and I can't think of a real solid argument against it. Until I can I will agree that I am against this bill. (I'm not giving up though, I'll let you know if I can think of a realistic argument against it.)"

We ONLY live on base because he is recently retired and we did not want to move mid-tour when we lost his allowance.

navy,37wdok,Amehunt,0,Sun May 31 10:38:17 2015 UTC,"You can't take away one person's entitlement   The entitlement is for ""housing"", full stop, not $$$.  If you'd really reside separately from your spouse just to milk more money from the government on two separate housings then by all means, do what your morality has you do.  But as soon as you start thinking of BAH as $$$ and simultaneously as being ""entitled"" to the $$$ instead of the housing then that logic would break down a lot of the rest of the things the Navy must do.  For instance, let's say there's a MIL-MIL couple in San Diego pulling in $5k combined on BAH and choosing to reside together in a dinky apartment for $1.8k. The Navy couldn't move either one of them to an area with lower BAH under your logic, because they are now ""entitled"" to that $3.2k tax-free excess."
navy,37wdok,mpyne,2,Sun May 31 06:15:28 2015 UTC,It's money if it just goes into your account and you decide what to do with it.  Live with your parents and they change you $200 a month? You get BAH.  Live in a small apartment that costs only half your BAH? You can spend the rest on Shoes or video games.  It's money until you treat it like OHA.
navy,37wdok,JCY2K,-1,Sun May 31 13:44:25 2015 UTC,"Live with your parents and they change you $200 a month?   Try doing that on TDY. Let me know how it goes once you get out of Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary. Here's what the regs have to say:   G. Lodging with a Friend or Relative a. Lodging reimbursement is not authorized for a member who lodges with a friend/relative at the friend’s/relative’s residence. ... e. The official traveler is not reimbursed the cost of comparable conventional lodging in the area, or for a flat or ‘token’ amount paid to the friend/relative.   Now since BAH is an allowance, you don't have to worry about that (yet...).  But either way, you're saying to treat it as $$$. So why didn't you address my example of the San Diego couple PCS'd out? If they're entitled to the $$$ that PCS would take away their entitlement. Only if they were ""only"" entitled to reasonable housing accomodations could the Navy PCS them out."
navy,37wdok,theillien,2,Sun May 31 19:16:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking TDY. Why bring that up? We are talking BAH.  I know plenty of people who are stationed in the same city as their Parents.  It's completely allowed.   Sounds like you agree with me.  Whatever you don't use on rent you can bank and use as you want.  So it's that extra is used like base pay.  As for you example:   For instance, let's say there's a MIL-MIL couple in San Diego pulling in $5k combined on BAH and choosing to reside together in a dinky apartment for $1.8k. The Navy couldn't move either one of them to an area with lower BAH under your logic, because they are now ""entitled"" to that $3.2k tax-free excess.   I don't understand that at all.  The navy can't ""move"" people unless they change their orders.  You don't get different BAH if you stationed in San Diego and but live in Santee vice downtown... it's the Same BAH.     I'll try to answer as best as my understanding allows tho... You are entitled to whatever the local BAH is.  So if the couple gets orders that move both of them to Mayport... then their entitled is whatever Mayport's BAH is..."
navy,37wdok,theillien,0,Sun May 31 19:28:17 2015 UTC,"You are entitled to whatever the local BAH is.   OK, great. So if they add another BAH categories to the two existing ones, ""Single"" and ""With Dependents""... and they call that category ""Married to Military"", and lump both servicemembers into that category, then that would be the local BAH for them. And that's what they'd be entitled to, even if that ""Married to Military"" category (since we're all claiming that neither MIL-MIL spouse is a real 'dependent' of the other) just happened to be, say, about 1/2 of the ""With Dependents"" rate.

I was talking about entitlement rates based on where you live.  A MIL-MIL is then receiving half of what their coworker who is married to a civilian is getting. That is not a fair entitlement.  One person does the job receives X allowance, another person does job receives x/2 allowance.  If it based purely on need (you argue MIL-MIL don't need 2 BAHs), then why do families with one child receive the same as those with 4?  Because it isn't based on need.  There is a nod in the direction of need but it is based on your rank the fact you are full time military and do a job that pulls a corresponding pay.  Equal pay for equal work.  Also since you asked me to respond your example, I would like you to respond to mine.  What about:   Live in a small apartment that costs only half your BAH? You can spend the rest on Shoes or video games. It's money...   I am curious to your views on this specifically ."

No, they're receiving 100% of what their coworker married to a civilian is getting. They're both getting, combined, BAH with dependents to cover the 1 (and only 1) housing unit that they each have. They are getting paid the same to get the same thing.   then why do families with one child receive the same as those with 4?   Actually it's baked into the BAH rate table assumptions. It's a poor assumption, for sure, but they actually do assume the number of dependents goes up with paygrade. And if you were in family housing you actually do generally get assigned larger units if you have more dependents.   Live in a small apartment that costs only half your BAH? You can spend the rest on Shoes or video games. It's money...   Great, good for you. I'm doing the same thing myself. It's just I actually do recognize it's a gravy train, and that it will likely go away someday.

But what I honestly would like to know is how many civilian spouses work and actually get paid a decent wage? From my experience and from most of what I've seen, mil-spouses have a very difficult time finding jobs when they have to move every few years. I feel as though most civilian spouses are the stay-at-home-parents or work crappy jobs or sell junk like Scentsy; they are typically not making tons of money to make this argument valid. I don't know where to find any hard data on this but some basic searching has led to this study which states ""Military spouses also earn 38 percent less than their civilian counterparts, while also being 30 percent more likely to be unemployed"".   I know my husband was turned down for a job at one of the only places that even offered him an interview solely because he was going to be leaving in the future and PCSing with me. In the 2.5 years we've been at our current duty station, he has never been able to find decent work, and he has a Bachelor's degree. He could not even get an interview at Target.   Some of these other arguments seem more reasonable, but this one, I'm just not buying yet."

And the hiring wages for her experience helps but isn't close to what she'd be earning if all her experience was with one company.

I have seen in this thread and the related one on /r/military several arguments that dual-MIL deserve this ""double BAH"" simply because if one of them was a civilian, they would be making tons more money; therefore getting BAH twice is compensation for this choice to both be in the military.   However, this is NOT the case from what I have seen. I'm simply asking for someone to back up their argument that civilian spouses make tons of money, and that if this passes, MIL-MIL marriages will end and one of them will just ""go make fat loots as a civilian""."

Additionally, if I apply for base housing, my spouse is not considered part of my family composition.  The BAH system needs revamped, but punishing dual military members is not the way to do it.

If I find someone--a civilian OR a military member--who helps me lower my rent cost, then why should I have to give back the rest and not the rest of the Navy?   In fact, I'm saving the Navy money by marrying a military member. Between us we both get BAH at single rates. If we married civilians, we'd be getting roughly $500 more because we'd be pulling BAH at dependent rates.   The problem is that BAH is coupled with marriage when it shouldn't be. BAH is granted to single sailors based on rank. Mil-mil are treated as single sailors in all instances, so they aren't granted BAH until they earn it based off rank--but SN Schmuckatelli is rated BAH just because he married someone.   My whole argument is if you're going to treat me as a single sailor, then do it--100% of the time. If you're going to treat me as a married sailor, then do it 100% of the time. Don't pick and choose at your convenience when you get to pick me as either. Mil-mil already have fewer rights than single or mil-civ sailors as it is."

They'd say ""I think $k,000 is a fair amount to compensate you for your skills and experience, use that money to fulfill your needs."" While I appreciate the tax benefits of BAH, and admittedly it was certainly part of the calculus when deciding where to take myself after law school, it is a piece of what the government thinks is fair compensation for my/our skills and experience."

If you're being undercompensated without BAH then your fellow shipmates and officers probably are too, and the solution is to increase basic pay or bonuses. BAH is for housing, has always been advertised as being for housing (whatever you happened to think of it), and because it's for housing we screw many sailors out of their ""compensation package"" when we assign them to barracks or other government quarters."

This bill offers to reduce their BAH in the same way. I'd say that alone is a good reason to get rid of the bill
navy,37wdok,Amehunt,3,Sun May 31 04:14:03 2015 UTC,"I think that's a huge point to be discussed. There are places where single BAH means you need a roommate. So if you have a sailor roommate, now you get less? Even though you both can't afford a 1 bedroom alone?"
navy,37wdok,mpyne,-2,Sun May 31 14:49:38 2015 UTC,The roommate hit only happens to E5 and above. If you're an E5 and can't afford a 1br apartment then there's probably more issues with how they determine BAH for that area in the first place than with anything else.
navy,37wdok,ThreeSevenJack,0,Sun May 31 15:46:38 2015 UTC,"Absolutely live within your means.   It isn't a loophole for fraudulent bah. Its an entitlement I have earned. If i choose to have a roommate to lessen expenses, then that's me being wise with my entitlements. No different that Seaman Schmuckatelli living with mommy or a civilian making way more to cover rent. The problem is two roommates can choose to move out and live in a place under their bah cap in order to be frugal with their entitlements--but I can't because I'm married. The whole bah system is broken but penalizing any active duty (married or not) is not the way to go about fixing it."
navy,37wdok,mpyne,1 point,Sun May 31 20:16:31 2015 UTC,There are a million ways to save money without targeting the benefits of our military members.  These politicians in Washington have STELLAR benefits that will NEVER be cut.
navy,37wdok,JCY2K,2,Sun May 31 06:58:25 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but the military is one of the biggest costs to the government, and personnel is one of the biggest cut-able (unlike acquisition because we can't really just cancel the F35 and Ford class at this point) chunk of that.  It sucks, but we have to view it as a reality.  So now the question is what benefits would you rather cut, or do you want to just get rid of X% of the active duty population?"
navy,37wdok,justatouchcrazy,3,Sun May 31 13:26:48 2015 UTC,You won't save in the long run by cutting benefits.  You will just lose good people.  People are our biggest asset and retraining costs a fortune.
navy,37wdok,justatouchcrazy,2,Sun May 31 15:54:14 2015 UTC,But that could also get you a smaller active duty population without having to do involuntary separations.
navy,37wdok,mpyne,1 point,Sun May 31 16:03:51 2015 UTC,The money saved in ending the MIL-MIL gravy train could actually be pumped back into basic pay or skill-specific retention bonuses. I'm not arguing for cutting people's pay but BAH is not supposed to be the method to compensate and retain our sailors. Using BAH for that is unfair to non-MIL/MIL married sailors and to single sailors.
navy,37wdok,Poopkitty,2,Sun May 31 16:10:28 2015 UTC,You will just ending losing one half of the couple to the private sector.
navy,37wdok,WIA16,2,Sun May 31 16:33:54 2015 UTC,"So we should pay a marriage bonus to those specific sailors who marry military?  I mean, I'm not even sure I would be opposed, I'm a beneficiary of the ""with dependents"" part of BAH. But if that's what we're going to do then let's call a spade a spade."
navy,37wdok,WIA16,3,Sun May 31 16:39:02 2015 UTC,"There is incredible stress with one member of a marriage in the military.  Imagine both members in the military. If they get a perk for both serving then so be it.  Plus think of this: instead of two families in the system with all the extra infrastructure costs, there is only one."
navy,37vrys,secondjar,9,Sat May 30 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"It means you made third.  When you actually get paid, you will get an updated profile sheet that says advanced."
navy,37vrys,hearshot,5,Sat May 30 20:45:00 2015 UTC,You'll know if you get paid early when it actually happens.  You can get a good idea of whether or not you might get paid early by how far above the qualifying FMS you were.
navy,37vrys,eskeTrixa,2,Sat May 30 22:14:26 2015 UTC,Well 35 people picked up and I was 17 points above the FMS. I'm not really sure if it's normally a point per person or what.
navy,37vrys,eskeTrixa,2,Sat May 30 22:22:01 2015 UTC,"Well, with 35 people picking up it's going to be 5 people paid early, one each month starting in July.  Therefore, if you're one of the top five FMS scores, you'll get it.  The points don't correlate linearly, but generally there's going to be more people right around the cutoff score than there are higher up.  17 over is pretty high, so you've got a good chance.  Do you know anyone else who picked up with a higher FMS score than you have?"
navy,37vrys,ICUCorpsman,1 point,Sat May 30 22:50:57 2015 UTC,Not that I know of. I got 97 percentile on the test but I only have a 3.8 eval average so someone else might have gotten higher than me. I guess i'll just have to wait and see.
navy,37vrys,eskeTrixa,-5,Sat May 30 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"Getting paid early depends on your percentile. If you're 97%, then you'll get paid two months after results come out.   Edit: let me clarify, they pay 3 percent early every month, up until the 6th month."
navy,37vrys,StewTrue,3,Sun May 31 00:37:45 2015 UTC,"No, it's dependent on your FMS, not your test percentile.  You can get an 99% on the test and not even advance in some rates."
navy,37vrys,CrazyDizzle,3,Sun May 31 01:21:41 2015 UTC,"This is true.  I scored in the 99th percentile when I made second (with an MP), and it still took 5 months for me to get paid.  I always wished there would be something included on the profile sheet that displayed your FMS percentile."

You'll do drills to learn how to fold and pass the flag, how to carry/fire the rifle, and how to (probably) fake the bugle. (A lot of bugles are battery operated to play taps; that's my one request for my funeral, get a real musician out there. I was the fake bugler for a year and it made me so upset every time someone would come to me teary-eyed and say ""that was the best Taps I have ever heard, old Harold would have been delighted to hear such an emotional, moving version! You did him a honor today!"" Like, how am I supposed to respond to that?! ""Thanks, ma'am, but I faked everything....."")  Anyway, aside from my bugling woes, funeral detail is awesome. It's a moment to respect our fallen brothers and sisters, it gives closure to the families, it's really an honor and not one to be taken lightly. I've had the opportunity to do a few burials at sea, too, and those are somehow more....just more.   It's a hard thing but worth every second. I've attended the burial of friends and shipmates and the funeral detail that was there to show them the respect and honor due meant a lot to me. So from someone who has been on both sides, take this chance, OP. You won't regret it.   Also, are you at DLI? Almost all of those burials are long-retired guys, so it is easier because they lived their lives fully and everyone expects an 80, 90 year old vet to kick the bucket. Not a 25 year old on her way home after a deployment. Everyone is emotional but there's more closure and completeness to those funerals"

Expect to be thanked, and expected to be asked for your name.  The video that /u/Endorphion posted is spot on.

You'll need to get the fuck over yourself and hand over some of your free time to the Navy and the family of one of our nation's honored uniformed dead.  You'd better have a fresh shave, shined shoes and those two ribbons better be centered and in the correct order. It's a goddamn honor to serve on a funeral detail.

When the family tells you that they appreciate you for being there - and they REALLY DO - tell them that it is a privilege.   When my father died, the nearest Army base sent a three man detail - including a Sergeant Major (that's a Master Chief), and a Captain (that's a LT to us). My dad wasn't anyone special - just a PFC who landed at Normandy and fought in the Battle of the Bulge and the Argonne Forest. I was deeply moved, as was my entire family. I was deeply appreciative.

EDIT: letter drafted, feel free to modify for your use:  Dear Senator,  My name is [redacted] and I am a [rank], stationed at [redacted.] My husband, [redacted] is a [rank, stationed at]. Thank you for your time and attention to this letter.  I am writing you in reference to your National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. In particular, section 604.  In all honesty, I am shocked that you would have suggested these proposed changes, because your stance has always been supportive of the military member. Your proposal to change the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is, in short, discriminatory and unfair. This is particularly striking because, according to the DoD Travel Webpage, “The purpose of the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) program is to provide fair housing allowances to service members.” Military service members are paid considerably less than our civilian counterparts. However, we receive benefits that compensate us and keep our employment competitive with the private sector. Our BAH is just one of those entitlements. It is an entitlement that certain sailors have earned based on rank. The entitlements should be based on equal pay—for equal work. But what your proposal has done is remove the “equal pay” portion from the equation. By making my military spouse “my dependent,” you have done us both a disservice. Two unmarried service members who are roommates can choose to leave their current housing arrangement and collect their full BAH. But because my roommate wears my ring, I am suddenly not eligible to the same benefit as my peers in the military—nor my spouse eligible to earn the same benefit as me. Yet, we are all the same rank, and do the same work.  When you add into this the fact that these changes do not impact government employees (two civilians, married or not, both get locality pay for an area) it only highlights the discriminatory nature of your proposal.  To treat me (or my spouse) as inferior due to our marital status is a deviation from your usual decisions. I am very disappointed with this proposed bill and I am sincerely asking that you strike from it Section 604.  Thank you so very much for your time and consideration in this matter.  Very respectfully,  [TheBeneGesseritWitch]"
navy,37o4ym,ThisVersionOfMyself,2,Fri May 29 04:03:44 2015 UTC,I already sent letters. Senator Graham basically said if you're not a South Carolina resident he won't respond and thanks you for his support on the war on Terror. Mind blowing that they treat dual mil members who arguably have it harder than anyone with deployments and the fact the Navy doesn't actually follow the co-lo instruction. I'm gonna re send it and put my state as South Carolina so he sees it. Both senator McCain and Graham are retired 0-6s which blows my mind. They basically got theirs and are telling dual mil to get fucked. I'm supposed to take a 36k a year pay cut because I am married? Get the fuck out. Here's my papers and I'm out if that is the case.

We were DIRT fucking poor as newlywed E-2/E-4s.  That said, it is an ENTITLEMENT. If a Sailor works the same amount of time and meets the qualifications, they deserve the same entitlements. I don't understand why the Navy doesn't run BAH more like OHA overseas, where they pay your RENT, and only that. It would make the BAH overage less of an issue.   But penalizing families for being dual-mil is the wrong way to go about it. I know plenty of Sailors who live with Mom and Dad (but have a 'lease',) or whose parents have bought them a house, or who use BAH for rental properties. Start proving BAH is used for the house the Sailor lives in and go from there."

Just because you're married to another military member, doesn't mean that either of you are entitled to BAH.   It is an entitlement, taking it away because of marital status is unfair.   EDIT: for clarity, what I'm saying is this: you either treat me all the time as a married servicemember, or you don't do any of the time. You don't get to pick and choose at your convenience when it's okay to consider me married. I'm either ""accompanied"" with my military spouse and all that it involves, or I'm a ""single sailor."""

navy,37o4ym,jabrodo,11,Sun May 31 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"This is ridiculous, discrimination. If you look at our base pay as military members, it's significantly lower than our civilian counterparts in jobs of comparable responsibilities. Generally our income is estimated through a combination of allowances and the value of our benefits. This estimation is what represents our value as salaried workers. That amount, X dollars, accounts for all of our expenses. Just like civilians are paid X dollars for their expenses. Now imagine that I show up to a company for a new job. They ask me if I am married and have kids. I say that I am married, and that she/he already works for the company. Now they tell me that the one with the higher position will get higher pay because they refuse to pay housing for both of us. I could sue for discrimination in this case. Let's take it one step further. When I show up to a new job they ask if I am married. I am. Now they choose to pay me less than a single employee doing the same work because they shouldn't have to pay for my housing because I have a spouse who brings in income that could cover that housing cost. That is an extremely clear case of discrimination. No matter how you look at it, you can't give one person in a couple more than the other. It's discrimination!!!!!!"

navy,37o4ym,BurningBushes2000,1 point,Fri May 29 14:14:00 2015 UTC,Actually no.  Philosophy doesn't make it true.  Bah is an allowance to pay for housing.  It isn't pay.  People want it both ways.  They want a tax free housing benefit but want it counted as compensation.
navy,37o4ym,HBHT9,5,Fri May 29 14:31:25 2015 UTC,"Let's put it a different way. It's a benefit we're entitled to that is lumped into to our net benefit package (compensation, insurance, etc.) to bring our benefits in line with civilian counterparts.  As an officer you have a college degree. The average starting salary for a fresh college graduate is $45k, per Forbes dated to 2013 so maybe its gone up a bit. Let's assume for the moment that this job also offers a comparable health insurance policy, a bit of a stretch, but not unreasonable. O1 base pay is $2934.3 or $35,211.6. We're ~$10k short here, and that's where BAH comes in. O1 Norfolk BAH adds and extra $17k on. Assuming the average college salary has gone up too, BAH brings us inline with that figure.  Further, as I said elsewhere, what about all the single people that live together for the exact same reason of driving down their housing costs so they can take home more of their BAH?   Let's take a four-bedroom apartment in Norfolk, that costs roughly $1200/month. We have four single ensigns drawing $1422/month in BAH, but they each pay $300/month in rent, so the government is overpaying for their housing by $4,488/month. We'll call it $4000 to factor in utilities and the like.  Same place, now with a married pair of ensigns with a child. One gets $1,644, the other, $1,422 per month under the current rules. The government is overpaying for their housing by $1,866/month. Dropping the same $488 for utilities brings it to $1,378. If they don't have dependents it is even less.  TL;DR: Not all compensation is part of your taxable paycheck. BAH is part of our compensation to bring it inline with our civilian counterparts. The idea that this will save the government money is bogus if they ignore the fact that single military personnel are doing the exact same thing for the exact same reason.  Edit: I also want to say that I think the BAH program itself is screwy. It's discriminatory to single enlisted and single personnel in general, and is a confusing and roundabout way to raise my compensation to a comparable civilian level. I'd much rather have it lumped into my base pay and simply have everyone get a higher salary across the board."
navy,37o4ym,HBHT9,4,Fri May 29 15:11:34 2015 UTC,"For the pay comparison, 45k is going to be low. A large percentage of people commissioning are Engineering/Stem, so 60k is closer to average.   The proposal would also drop single BAH to 75% if someone had roommates.   I'm not a big fan of the BAH and bonus/incentive system. I'd rather have a higher base pay and than percentage multipliers based on job and location. So shift work or high cost of living area gets X% more. It would be more inline with civilian jobs.   They are already stating to have retention issues with the recent years groups, this will contribute even more."
navy,37o4ym,Poopkitty,1 point,Fri May 29 20:24:18 2015 UTC,Actually. I have the 2015 commissioning source metrics on my work computer for commissioning.  It got sent to me for a project at work. It is about 50% humanities and 50% STEM. I too would rather just have higher base pay. There is no arguing that this will kill retention. Most of the female JOs at work are married to other officers they met in college.

navy,37o4ym,BurningBushes2000,5,Fri May 29 04:16:19 2015 UTC,I would be happy if my BAH actually covered my rent!
navy,37o4ym,Kailuafornia,6,Fri May 29 05:16:47 2015 UTC,"Alright. This is about to stir the pot. If you are going to respond to it, please keep it civil. I'm going to try to make it as organized as I can to allow people to respond in an organized fashion. Also, please ignore grammar /spelling as I am on my phone.   Me- I'm military. Joined in 1999. I'm married. I'm not dual mil. I am an officer. I've got my warfare pin.   The problem: The military budget is bloated and (conservatively) one-quarter of it goes to personnel. https://www.cbo.gov/publication/43574 Now we need to cut something. I think we need to kill a carrier and a lot of the Congressional tanks-for-no-one pork but something needs to be reduced in manpower costs. Here's my ramblings on where.    BAH is an entitlement to pay for to a home. It isn't an entitlement to additional pay. Viewing it as such isn't within the scope of the original intent. Outside of extreme circumstances, one BAH should be enough to provide that across the board for any co-located family. Can anyone prove that wrong?  People need to shift their mindset. This NIMBY rhetoric doesn't solve any god damn problems. Get used to the suck, because it never goes away. We've got it a lot better today than when my Dad or Granddad served.  Other cuts are needed. Retirement and medical costs eat up 40% of personnel costs. I've always been in favor of delayed officer retirement. Enlisted need it because it is a major factor in retention in non-civilianable rates like Navigation ET/quartermaster. Officers can easily have a second career that carries them to 60, baring special medical cases where a board could grant immediate access to retirement benefits. That's usually 18 years of cost savings. Tricare co-pays and subscription premiums need to go up, especially for officers with families. And preferably only for them. The officers I've known above LT tend to work their ass off (just my experience) but are very well compensated. They could take some belt tightening.  While I agree that our enlisted are generally underpaid for the amount of work they do, I contend that they are not underpaid compared to counterpart civilians. Most submarine E-6s I know make above 1- 2 standard deviations from median income both for their age and education. Sure, it sucks to pay your dues but eventually the pay gets good. Furthermore, the day of the bloated contractor is coming to an end. (Barring ISIS). There's a lot more skepticism and I've seen contractors getting chopped left and right at my job - therefore there are less lucrative ""I'll be paid more on the outside"" jobs than there used to be for people who don't invest in themselves and get an education.  We'll, enough rambling. Those are my points. I'm off to bed and work so I'll check back in 16 hours or so. This is Reddit. If you can, please CMV. But so it with something more reasonable than rhetoric equivalent to ""de took our jobs"" (yes, it is a dated Southpark reference. I joined in 99, what do you want.)"
navy,37o4ym,Send_Lawyers,10,Fri May 29 09:04:25 2015 UTC,I'll bite. I have a warfare pin and if you read my history you'll know I'm an aviator. You touch my pay I walk. You don't give me a 75k+ bonus every time my obligation is up I walk. You even think about changing the retirement package I walk.   I work way to head away from my friends and family to even begin to think I owe the navy one penny.   I'm married to a civiy who usually can't work due to my duty station. If I was mil to mil and you pulled this one of us is stepping asap.   Want to reduce personnel costs. Go for it. But don't fool yourself for a second and think you are going to keep the best and brightest if you do.   Me and my wife can make more than my naval salary if we move where we want to and both work. I don't need the navy. They need me. And the quickest way to get me out the door after they spent millions training me to rain death from above is to cut my benefits.    You wanna cut bm I moveheavythings benis? Go for it. We can replace him. Tons of people meet his required pre reqs.   Good luck replacing me.
navy,37o4ym,Kailuafornia,4,Fri May 29 09:54:23 2015 UTC,Also an officer. I know I make a lot but I've also been in for almost 12 years.   The navy will hit a saturation point for people where no matter how much money they pay and how good the benefits are the service members want be willing to make the sacrifices. They need to be real careful on what they cut because people will walk.
navy,37o4ym,Send_Lawyers,7,Fri May 29 13:04:41 2015 UTC,Lol have fun.  Do you really think it's hard to fill an Aviator slot?  The airline industry isn't exactly appealing and pays no where near what a LT makes.   My friend who left active duty made what an E5 made his first year in the airlines.     This is the problem with the DOD.   Everyone has an entitlement mentality.
navy,37o4ym,BurningBushes2000,14,Fri May 29 11:08:39 2015 UTC,Hard to fill an aviator slot. No. Hard to fill a 12+ year aviator slot with 7+ years of FDNF experience and DH experience yes.   Any nugget can fly a jet. Not any nugget can lead and design strike packages against high threat targets and lead and fly strike packages against near peer opponents.  Call me entitled all you like I know exactly what the airline would pay my because I've interviewed with them. And while I might take a 20-30k total dollar pay cut I more than make up for it by being able to live in a urban area of my choosing and allowing my wife to earn half my current salary.  Couple that with zero deployment and the ability to increase my pay rate every year vice the bull shit 2% raises we get in the navy and I'm more than ok with rolling the dice.   Like I said. As long as navy keeps the bonuses and the good deals coming I'll play ball. As soon as they say no thanks... I walk.   I don't need them. They need me. And if that changes. There are corporate jobs waiting for someone with 10+ years of management experience and a MBA. I'll happily take a 50k pay cut to never deploy and have my wife gainfully employed.
navy,37o4ym,SailorAground,0,Fri May 29 11:19:50 2015 UTC,"Increase your pay rate every year?   The airlines isn't merit based.   It's a union based on time.   I'm not sure how that works.     Corporate jobs waiting?   I'm not sure how much civilian experience you have,  but Officers aren't just going to walk into 100K corporate jobs simply because they're Officers with an MBA.   You start at the bottom in the corporate world making 60K until you prove yourself.  All that aside,  what is your recommendation?  The DOD is bloated to the max,  and anytime a cut is suggested someone screams foul.   So what,  and where,  do we actually make cuts?"
navy,37o4ym,Send_Lawyers,3,Fri May 29 11:34:51 2015 UTC,Why is a carrier required in the gulf 24/7. What exactly is that accomplishing for the average U.S. Citizen? Winning the war in Iraq? Yeah we're fucking nailing it!  Our entire anti drug ops in South America. The p3s El Salvador? The ddgs sort of hunting pirates but not really Africa?  Most of our navy is poorly deployed in the same role they were filling in 1982.   The threat has changed.   The need for ships has changed.   And our force structure hasn't changed at all  Top threats today.  Cyber Subs Missiles.   We are still building training and sustaining a force to fight red blue water navy in a carrier on carrier engagement.  Fuck all that.   Let's build real destroyers the kind that can actually fight modern diesel subs. With a real light weight torp not the mk 54.   Let's get missiles on par with the adversary in number and deploy ability on all our ships.   Let's focus on the fight in space denied areas. Relearn emcom tactics. Decision making at the ℅ level on ddgs and below.   You want to save navy money? Gut the carriers. And cut the dead weight in the ship yards and useless navy bases.   You want to charge retired people more for their pills to pay for another useless carrier? Get fucked.
navy,37o4ym,BurningBushes2000,6,Fri May 29 11:49:23 2015 UTC,2 carrier presence in the gulf is running the navy broke. It needs to end. There is zero reason for it and it is way to expensive to keep sending air wings and strike groups through workups and then on a cruise. They need to cut that shit.
navy,37o4ym,Send_Lawyers,3,Fri May 29 13:01:18 2015 UTC,"Not exactly true. A lot of the Vietnam and post-Vietnam era pilots who are the line captains in the airlines are about to be force retired due to age. When that happens the military pilots will have a leg up because of the way the airlines and FAA count hours and quals. When that happens, watch an exodus of aviators happen."
navy,37o4ym,ceno65,4,Fri May 29 17:44:00 2015 UTC,It is already happening. Due to the 04 stat board last year it was a wake up call to aviation that big navy doesn't value aviation. Heard loud and clear. Almost every single aviator I know at a state side shore tour is getting their ATPL and civil logbook in order to make the switch. Why would I want to stay navy when I can make 70K a year working 4-5 days a week with no deployments?
navy,37o4ym,Send_Lawyers,2,Fri May 29 19:35:53 2015 UTC,"This is a strong argument for getting out. Sure, I make roughly 100k right now.  That is set to go up with another promotion next year and two pay increases for time in service. But I'll hit a point where I'd take a 50-60k cut to work 40 hours a week with no deployments and no PCS orders. It happens to everyone where they no longer are willing to sacrifice what the navy requires. And can you blame them? The navy makes it clear with a 50% selection rate and also proposals to cut benefits. Not to mention other factors like the shit show Iraq turned into and afghanistan will turn into.   At the end of the day I am tired of being political cannon fodder. I try my best to take care of the enlisted because they have it far worse then I do."
navy,37o4ym,ceno65,2,Sat May 30 16:05:21 2015 UTC,I haven't spoken with an aviator at 7-9 years of service who doesn't 100% share these sentiments.
navy,37o4ym,mpyne,2,Sat May 30 22:52:40 2015 UTC,How about we stop flight pay for people who are not even flying. What's it called a gate letter? Just because you used to fly and now your on shore duty why do you get flight pay ? Or make it fair and give sailors sea pay while not at sea. In other news I'd take a pay cut just to get your mandated sleep schedule.
navy,37o4ym,ceno65,3,Sat May 30 03:59:50 2015 UTC,Flight bay is 650 a month for qualified avaitors. If you take that away its 20k over a 36 month shore tour. See you later is what I say to that. Good luck filling those DH slots in tacair and p3s.   Ps every p8 pilot finishes their first sea tour with enough hours to start immediately at the comm air. Good luck retaining them.
navy,37o4ym,mpyne,3,Sat May 30 07:34:21 2015 UTC,Exactly I get sea pay when I am at sea. You should get flight pay only when you fly.
navy,37o4ym,Send_Lawyers,3,Sat May 30 07:46:20 2015 UTC,"Sea pay helps incentivize sailors to go back to sea in particular, which is why sea pay exists. Aviators can't exactly easily refuse orders to go back to an operational squadron, as such flight pay is more of a retention-related bonus than an assignment-related bonus, so it makes more sense to pay it throughout.  I mean let's face it, even if we only paid flight pay to people in a flying status, the Navy would still have to pay the same amount to keep aviators and aircrew in, they'd just end up paying more per month when people are in a flying status to make up the difference."
navy,37o4ym,ceno65,1 point,Sat May 30 13:54:17 2015 UTC,So there's no aviators on some LLD or equivalent bullshit soaking up flight pay why sitting in an office. Keep digging deeper.

navy,37o4ym,BurningBushes2000,3,Sat May 30 22:09:07 2015 UTC,That is 100% not true. You get sea pay an entire sea tour regardless of whether the ship is in port or out.   I get fly pay the day I put my wings on and get to keep it until I can no longer fly. Just because I'm on a shore your doesn't mean I'm not flying.   If it is a non flying non aviator designated billet then fly pay stops. But if it's a non flying aviator designated billet it should continue because that billet needs aviation experience.   Additionally I am worth more to the navy. They spent millions training me. So I get paid more. Sorry if you don't like that. Choose your rate choose your fate.
navy,37o4ym,ceno65,1 point,Sat May 30 22:51:49 2015 UTC,The gate letter goes till your 22nd or 24th year I thought. Especially for reservists its a bit much. The navy can replace all of us. All they have to do is play top gun on TNT for a month straight and I'm sure every recruiter will make their qual. If we were so hard up on aviators they would start drafting. We are all replaceable.

navy,37o4ym,TheBeneGesseritWitch,0,Sat May 30 23:54:29 2015 UTC,Sea pay doesn't require you to take anywhere even remotely close to the risk of what aviators do while inside the cockpit.  Aviation is inherently dangerous and requires a ton of qualifications and constant progressing thru syllabus after syllabus. Sea duty requires non of that.  That is why they get that.
navy,37o4ym,mpyne,1 point,Sat May 30 16:08:55 2015 UTC,So there's no aviators on some LLD or equivalent bullshit soaking up flight pay why sitting in an office. Keep digging deeper.
navy,37o4ym,TheBeneGesseritWitch,2,Sat May 30 21:47:45 2015 UTC,No there isn't. If they have a med down chit they do not collect flight pay.   And that isn't the point. Aviators take much more risk than your average boat guy and that is why they are comped for it.
navy,37o4ym,mpyne,5,Sat May 30 22:17:32 2015 UTC,"BAH is an entitlement to pay for to a home. It isn't an entitlement to additional pay. Viewing it as such isn't within the scope of the original intent. Outside of extreme circumstances, one BAH should be enough to provide that across the board for any co-located family. Can anyone prove that wrong?   There are factors to consider here above and beyond what you are aware of IRT ""collocated."" Iwakuni and Sasebo are collocated. That's SIX HOURS BY BULLET TRAIN away. But ""that's the same geographical area."" King's Bay, GA and Jacksonville, FL are ""same geographical area."" That ""extra BAH"" goes to cover things that dual military members have to deal with in their housing needs like transportation. (Edit: I get off work, and if my husband has duty, I have a two hour drive to get to his base to pick up our son from the CDC. Plus, we are fined because we are late in picking him up.) Additionally, if I don't want to live with my husband, why should I be forced to? Why can't I be self-sufficient and take my BAH and move out? What about sailors who are divorcing, but due to this policy they are forced to depend on the senior spouse for their housing needs?   What about gay and lesbian couples who are ""just roomates"" in the eyes of the navy--they both get to keep their BAH because they aren't married according to the Navy.   The big problem here is that the Navy wants to treat me as a single sailor--half of the time. Oh, you have duty the same day your spouse does? Tough--you have a family care plan, single sailors with kids deal with it too. You just finished training or we don't have a billet for you? Tough, you get stationed away from your family. Oh, you want to live in base housing but need three members in your family--sucks, cause your husband doesn't count since he's active duty. He can get a BEQ on base though, while you live out in town.   You can't pick and choose when and how to treat me as a single sailor. Either I get all the benefits single sailors do, or I get all the benefits married sailors do. This penalization for being married to a fellow sailor is wrong. You want us to live together and only give us one housing allotment, cool. Do it for all the roomates too--if you have a roommate, even a civilian, you should get less BAH. Take away BAH for anyone who doesn't have a lease for the place where they currently reside. Quit making BAH automatic based on rank and require proof that you actually live there alone or with dependents where none of them are contributing to rent."
navy,37o4ym,TheBeneGesseritWitch,3,Fri May 29 12:47:16 2015 UTC,"Do it for all the roomates too   Well, that's actually in the bill too...  Personally I agree that in a perfect world BAH would cover housing (and associated costs) and that's it, and if you happen to do the roommate or MIL/MIL thing then BAH in total between everyone shouldn't exceed their 'share' of the total housing cost.  However I recognize that many of us (including myself!) utilize BAH to supplement income so there's no fair way to implement that kind of change without also raising base pay to compensate so that we're still getting approx. the same overall compensation. And you also bring up very good points about the kind of costs that go with being MIL-MIL that the rest of us probably never have to think about.  But as long as we continue to completely deny BAH to those assigned government quarters, I will always think that it's unfair for those receiving BAH to treat it as anything other than what it says, an ""allowance for housing"". If BAH is really more than ""what's needed for housing"" then we're screwing over single sailors around the country who can't get off ship or the barracks."
navy,37o4ym,Kailuafornia,1 point,Sat May 30 14:02:30 2015 UTC,"In drafting up my letter to Sen McCain, I read the bill and saw that. The bill is still discriminatory. BAH is designed to supplement income by compensating for cost of housing. Your argument is still flawed--because people who find housing below their BAH line aren't required to return the overage--so why should those who are married or have roommates be penalized by having their entitlement taken away?   I do agree absolutely that denying BAH to those who are forced to live on the ship or in the BEQ is unfair, but you know, penalizing those who are married is an asinine way to go about fixing the problem.   Also, I would like to point out that this is a problem that the other branches have, as well, but they at least have barracks. Putting an E3 on a ship and telling him it is commensurate with a barracks room is ridiculous. Telling him a barracks room is equal with money is also a big fat lie."
navy,37o4ym,SailorAground,1 point,Sat May 30 22:47:30 2015 UTC,"BAH is designed to supplement income by compensating for cost of housing.   That's basically my whole argument. Because of that I hope your letter to Sen. McCain addresses your point without using that as your argument. :)  You're worried about the overall hit to your (and your spouse's) compensation, but the solution to that is to increase the thing that's supposed to be your compensation, ""basic pay"".    people who find housing below their BAH line aren't required to return the overage   MIL-MIL wouldn't be required to return the overage if this bill passes either. The ""overage"" would simply be less, comparable to the ""overage"" that a MIL-CIV (or single sailor) could achieve.  Now, you would have a good argument that a MIL-MIL couple should each have the ability to get the benefit of an overage from choosing below-market average housing. I personally think that dual BAH single overestimates that overage though, so I wasn't at all surprised to see Congress attack it. And of course, the risk of bringing up that a lot of sailors find places below BAH is that Congress would simply drop BAH rates further... (though that wouldn't be an issue if they shift it over to basic pay).  Putting compensation where it belongs (base pay) would also avoid penalizing those who can't be given BAH (either because they're in barracks or in those stupid PPV housing arrangements).  I'll be the first to agree that shipboard berthing is by no means ""housing"" but I don't think anyone actually thinks any differently. Fixing basic pay would at least go some way toward helping that though; making BAH anything other than ""compensation for housing"" would not."
navy,37o4ym,redumbdant_antiphony,1 point,Sat May 30 23:52:25 2015 UTC,"No, I couldn't figure how to address ""you need to fix BAH because it's stupid and broken!!"" with the word limit given on their online contact form, so I went with this:  Dear Senator,  My name is [redacted] and I am a [rank], stationed at [redacted.] My husband, [redacted] is a [rank, stationed at]. Thank you for your time and attention to this letter.   I am writing you in reference to your National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. In particular, section 604.  In all honesty, I am shocked that you would have suggested these proposed changes, because your stance has always been supportive of the military member. Your proposal to change the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is, in short, discriminatory and unfair. This is particularly striking because, according to the DoD Travel Webpage,  “The purpose of the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) program is to provide fair housing allowances to service members.” Military service members are paid considerably less than our civilian counterparts. However, we receive benefits that compensate us and keep our employment competitive with the private sector. Our BAH is just one of those entitlements.  It is an entitlement that certain sailors have earned based on rank. The entitlements should be based on equal pay—for equal work. But what your proposal has done is remove the “equal pay” portion from the equation. By making my military spouse “my dependent,” you have done us both a disservice. Two unmarried service members who are roommates can choose to leave their current housing arrangement and collect their full BAH. But because my roommate wears my ring, I am suddenly not eligible to the same benefit as my peers in the military—nor my spouse eligible to earn the same benefit as me. Yet, we are all the same rank, and do the same work.   When you add into this the fact that these changes do not impact government employees (two civilians, married or not, both get locality pay for an area) it only highlights the discriminatory nature of your proposal.   To treat me (or my spouse) as inferior due to our marital status is a deviation from your usual decisions. I am very disappointed with this proposed bill and I am sincerely asking that you strike from it Section 604.  Thank you so very much for your time and consideration in this matter.  Very respectfully,  [TheBeneGesseritWitch]"

I'm sure an e3 being forced to live in the barracks is stoked his two peers are getting 3500 a month tax free simply for being married.    I get why some people are mad.  It's because their gravy train might end.  But no one can tell me why we pay married sailors money for a place to live when they're spouse already receives it.  Like I said, we can start making everyone pay income tax on their bah if they want to claim it has income."
navy,37o4ym,TheBeneGesseritWitch,7,Fri May 29 02:46:13 2015 UTC,"Like I said, we can start making everyone pay income tax on their bah if they want to claim it has income.   I like this plan. I also like the idea of blanket BAH for rank. Your marital status should not change your entitlements. That's an outdated patriarchal holdover that needs to go."
navy,37o4ym,Poopkitty,3,Fri May 29 03:03:56 2015 UTC,"I like your thoughts on this. I think a blanket system would clear a lot of things up. In this situation specifically, you have a pretty large visual chasm that translates to single vs. married - detracting from the primary issue. If things were less complicated it would help.   I'm not married, but maybe someone can chime in on this. Why exactly are mil-mil marriages that are stationed on the same post eligible to receive dependent BAH. I know it's only the senior, but still - it seems like an unnecessary expenditure. If two E5's are co-located in Tampa making a cumulative ~$2600.xx a month - what the hell is the need for one of them to receive a dependent stipend? Is it an oversight or is there something I am missing?"
navy,37o4ym,TheBeneGesseritWitch,3,Fri May 29 03:21:15 2015 UTC,"Why exactly are mil-mil marriages that are stationed on the same post eligible to receive dependent BAH.   They're not if I read the article correctly. The dependent portion comes only if they have children. What I got from the article said that in a mil-mil relationship with children, the senior member draws dependent BAH while the junior draws normal BAH."
navy,37o4ym,mpyne,3,Fri May 29 03:28:36 2015 UTC,"That's because someone has to claim the dependent and when you have dependents (in the case of mil-mil marriages these are children and other relatives) you have higher costs. Also, if my civilian spouse can't work because she's being uprooted every two years due to needs of the Navy, then I'm stuck being the some breadwinner for my family. Maybe it is old school but I know a lot of my Sailors who need that extra $500 to $1000 in order to keep food on the table and the lights on."

Single in my pay entitlements, single in my duty station assignments, single in every sense of the word. That's why we both draw BAH, because we both earned it."

navy,37o4ym,mpyne,3,Fri May 29 16:05:55 2015 UTC,"Yes. 100% this. But for your edification, just because two military members are married, BAH is not automatic. It is based off the same requirements as a single sailor. My spouse is nonexistent according to the navy when it comes to calculating my entitlements. I can't even get a house on base because ""your husband is active duty so he doesn't count in your family composition. And, as a single sailor you aren't entitled to base housing."""

Are you aware E5 and below on shore duty and E5 and below on shore duty are not entitled to BAH? It's at the command's discretion. But an O1 is entitled to it.

Please, let's do that, because if O1's really are doing that, that's BAH fraud. Even O1s are not entitled to BAH if they are receiving government quarters, the entitlement is that they can always choose to live off the ship (and thereby draw BAH). But if they're really living completely on the ship then they don't rate BAH, and if they draw it anyways that's fraud."

But I don't get BAH unless I have an approved request chit and a lease until senior enough rank kicks in. It's expected O1 will live in town. It's not expected E1 will. Ergo, the E1 that gets married for BAH and the O1 who stays on the ship and pockets his BAH are just as guilty of BAH ""fraud.""

Sometimes a ship/plane/whatever is transporting your mail gets too close to America and the mail will get routed through America--meaning USPS so you have to pay for it. MPS strictly uses military equipment and servicemembers which is why it's no charge.   If you're utilizing a local post office, then you need to make sure you're addressing his address correctly (with USA on the address, and international mail charges etc). Additionally if they're sending you mail, they'll need to make sure your mail is addressed to your local standards  Otherwise...

I think I just said, ""Uhh,"" as I passed them. In hindsight I should have asked why they saluted because that had me scratching my head the whole way to work."

I know that, in '10, we did middie cruises for 2 months solid (in for the weekend, out for a week with a new group). By the end of it, all of us hated the Mids.  Lastly, a big thing to remember is that, despite how important some officers might feel they are, it's the guys in the trenches (specifically, the blue shirts and Chiefs) who can make or break their careers/sanity.

Realistically, you'll only see Navy options in the surface or sub fleet. Maybe Marine ops for a couple days.  Academy mids are just Academy mids. They can apply for any Navy community or the USMC.  You don't get selected for a community until your senior year. The three nuclear communities are, of course, subs, surface nukes, and naval reactors. While they may have wanted to go into one of these communities, there isn't any special pipeline for it while they're in college."

navy,37n7hx,piedpipernyc,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:46:55 2015 UTC,"Getting a degree and certs will help. Keep in mind, despite your managerial experience, you'll likely be seen as new to the IT realm. Provided the job market is decent, you shouldn't have to worry about being treated the same as a guy that worked in Best Buy's Geek Squad for a few months, but it might still be challenging.   You might want to try to leverage your experience to get in on a DoD contract or something like that when you separate. I don't know if going back to full-time work would be best as it depends on your personal circumstances. If you think you might, definitely try to do so before your clearance expires as the process of getting a new one can be sluggish.  If you go the job route, remember, even if it's not networking or managerial, your big focus is building up experience.  I went from fixing sonar equipment (man you guys loved using our SIPR access as an excuse to get away from officers and sit around and bullshit with STGs on my ship) to conventional IT by way of being a contractor. I had to learn to fix a lot of Navy specific equipment I had no experience with and also learned the basics of being a sysadmin. It was tough, but the experience gave me what I needed to get my foot in the door and do normal IT.  Basically, you might need to look at this as a long term plan. Maybe do a decent experience-building DoD gig for a bit then go back to school full-time on the GI Bill. Pull off both and do school part-time while working. I know Lockheed-Martin would help with tuition when I worked for them. You have to be careful as the agreement usually has stipulations like working ""x"" number of years or you have to pay it back. At the same time, companies like that like to promote from within and like employing veterans. It can be possible to move up into the networking position you want depending on the company and timing."

I would be looking into working full time of course. A DoD job would be a better benefit for me since just getting out. And I will still have a clearance so hopefully that works out into my favor. I would prefer the experience building DoD gig for a bit so if it gets stagnant, I can leave with tons of experience. Thanks again for the advice."

navy,37n7hx,deadfenix,1 point,Fri May 29 17:50:09 2015 UTC,Military experience is always a plus. Jobs love prior service members. Even though your rate wasn't related to IT it will still help. A security clearance can help you grab a job as a dod civilian or working as a contractor.  Networking is a great field in IT. I would suggest getting Cisco certified as well as getting the Security + certification. Having those two will increase your chances of getting a job right away.   You should try and get some hands on experience somewhere. The problem with the IT field is that so many people have an education and certifications in the field but have no real hands on experience.

Those are pretty useful to know if you spend any time as a desktop tech or even for personal productivity.   You'll find that even though not all coding languages are the same, there are concepts and practices that are very similar and give an insight in learning something new. I didn't know VBA when I started messing around with creative uses of Excel but I was familiar with C++. It's not the same, but there were enough similarities in structure that I could start to make sense of it and knew the right questions to google to fill in the blanks.  It's kind of like learning any other type of language. You can learn a lot of Spanish and maybe begin to be able to decipher some French or Italian. You're still going to need to learn the proper pronunciation, a bit of language specific rules, but you'll recognize structure and similarities that also make it easier to grasp."

navy,37iaty,jou13,2,Thu May 28 05:17:30 2015 UTC,"More information here from the local Honolulu newspaper    The USS Arizona Memorial is closed to visitors Wednesday morning after a tug boat collided with the memorial’s dock, making it “not safe for people to land there,” a spokeswoman said.  A tug boat maneuvering the USNS Mercy hospital ship collided with the memorial’s mooring dock, said spokeswoman Abby Wines.  Visitors were still being taken from the shore-side USS Arizona Memorial Visitor’s Center by Navy launch out to the memorial, which straddles the remains of the battleship that was destroyed by a Japanese aerial attack on Dec. 7, 1941, launching the United States into World War II.   Because of the damaged dock, the Navy launches are not able to tie up to let visitors onto the memorial, Wines said.  Divers will go out to inspect the damage later today, she said.  Wines did not have a specific time for the collision but Navy Region spokeswoman Agnes Tauyan estimated that the accident happened around 7:30 a.m.   The Military Sealift Command hospital ship USNS Mercy arrived at Pearl Harbor on Monday for Pacific Partnership 2015, which the Navy calls the largest annual multilateral humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission conducted in the Indio-Asia-Pacific region."

navy,37jq23,Superkeys,6,Thu May 28 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"While you can do great things with current diesel/AIP submarine technology, and they can be quieter than a nuke boat, the pure speed an SSN can cruise/search/track/evade at makes nuke boats much more useful/successful against diesel boats. Developing a firing solution takes time, and it's a hell of a lot easier to make a solution if you can drive around faster longer to drive bearing. I'm not saying there's no place for diesel boats, as they are useful, particularly in ASuW (our surface forces typically can't find a submarine even if its surfaced) but the SSN will almost always win against an SSK in an ASW environment."
navy,37jq23,gentlemangin,5,Thu May 28 14:06:40 2015 UTC,"If diesel boats were ever useful for USN it would mean we have much much larger problems than too many carriers. You can't do power projection or the type of POTUS-level national tasking with SSKs, you actually need the capability provided by the glowing rock on the back of our SSNs.  Diesel boats are great for coastal defense, and perhaps ISR in close-by waterways. But that's not what the USN does, we project national power. It might make sense to encourage our allies in the PACOM AOR to pursue SSKs so that they can become the regional experts on using diesels to deny the oceans to adversaries if SHTF, but there's no reason for USN to pursue them at that point.  Maybe if we should ever become a third-rate world power..."
navy,37jq23,mpyne,5,Thu May 28 22:18:09 2015 UTC,"I think that Carriers are massive and important assets that we should have, but I think we should also look into getting a lot of smaller craft, such as the Patrol Craft of old, especially with the Frigates leaving.  The LCS's are neat, but under armed for the roles that they are being asked to fill, and to big and expensive.  Smaller, simpler patrol craft with modern tech, in large numbers, would be perfect for so many of the Navy's modern missions and tastings."
navy,37jq23,Zoe_the_biologist,5,Thu May 28 10:00:29 2015 UTC,"Admirals would have to cede authority to 04s on patrol craft, in charge of missiles. Not gonna happen."

navy,37jq23,Izzy42,3,Thu May 28 12:07:12 2015 UTC,It is highly assumed that any war with China will be fought without that network. The first thing to go will be the satalights. Then the missiles. Then well it will be over.   As someone else said. Small missile frigates and patrol craft could counter this. But that puts an awful lot of power in junior officers hands.   Something very unlikely to happen until it needs to.
navy,37jq23,Send_Lawyers,2,Thu May 28 20:28:40 2015 UTC,"The Army has survived putting authory in the hands of O-2s and E-7s, somehow I think the Navy would survive if we mentor our junior leaders well."
navy,37jq23,mpyne,3,Thu May 28 22:20:10 2015 UTC,The army does not put weapon release authority for cruise missiles in 02-E7s hands full stop.   I'm not saying they couldn't do it. I'm sure they could.   My point was that given the diplomatic environment in seventh fleet the current admiralty is not going to give a LT on a patrol boat or an 04 on a corvette the authority to launch anti ship cruise missiles. Additionally we struggle to even achieve parity with Chinese missiles due to weapons bans signed with Russia on testing medium range missiles.   The South China Sea is a powder keg. Both sides say they won't shoot first but you better believe they will try to goad the U.S. Side into shooting. The incident on cowpens last year highlights this.   It will only get worse. Making it easier to fire missiles might win the war but not shooting them will prevent it.
navy,37jq23,Send_Lawyers,2,Thu May 28 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"I guess my point is simply that it may come down to giving O-4s the authority to do what is needed to win the war in a comms-degraded environment. The Chinese are not stupid and will do what they can to disrupt our C2 if a shooting conflict should ever happen; so, nor should we be stupid. If we can't guarantee our C2 we need to either have backup plans or just surrender early. There's no point in going in-between just to get a whole bunch of people killed and ships sunk just for us to have to withdraw anyways :P"
navy,37jq23,mpyne,1 point,Fri May 29 00:05:42 2015 UTC,I completely agree. But you are asking a group of 55+ year old men to agree to not only build new ships. With new missiles. But then give command of these ships to young officers. Most of whom will never have been to Asia or the SCS before. Then in a degraded C2 environment expect them to not shoot first in an escalating threat scenario.   This exact scenario has happened before and it went badly. The shooting down of the Iranian jet liner is one exams of shooting. The pueblo off North Korea is a second example of not shooting.   Either way the navy looked bad. And since then decision making only continues to be driven upward.   So do we need what you are calling for? Sure. If we want to win a shooting war that is what we need.   But will we prevent a shooting war from starting by not having it? Probably.   What we really need is a policy that allows China to rise without firing bullets.    When the U.S. Created the Monroe doctrine in the Caribbean and South America it didn't start a war. European powers were smart enough to make it work without repeating the war of 1812. (Other conflicts in Europe mattered a little more at the time.)  Today the U.S. Is Europe and China is trying to assert a Monroe doctrine. The trick is figuring out how to work with them without shooting each other. I hope both sides diplomats are up to the task because I a shooting war will be very short and very exploady
navy,37jq23,Send_Lawyers,2,Fri May 29 01:52:14 2015 UTC,"What we really need is a policy that allows China to rise without firing bullets.   Agreed. A strong Navy is probably part of that policy though, just as a strong military helped nudge the USSR away from the policies they'd have rather employed.  The risk of subordinates doing stupid things is simply part of the risk envelope of being a senior leader. After all the airliner that was shot down was ordered destroyed by a Commanding Officer with full weapons release authority, not by an underling, so it's already clear that holding the decision with senior leadership is not enough.  While I don't necessarily expect zero defect and micromanagement to go away completely, the fact is that the umbilical will be cut if combat happens, and senior leadership's job is to ensure that their subordinates are ready for that before it happens.  We did it during the Cold War during EMCON exercises so it's not as if the Navy is institutionally incapable. Admiral Nelson was legendary for his pre-battle preparations with his subordinates (and this was back when ship captains were expected to be diplomats in addition to warriors, a far greater scope of responsibility than what we're talking about here!).  Either way though, there's one 55+ year old man who has been harping on the need to devolve real decision making down to the lowest possible levels, and he's been doing it for years. He is General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he's been pushing ""mission command"" for years now.  Mission command didn't used to be innovative; the Navy had been doing it all the time, we need to get back to it."
navy,37jq23,mpyne,6,Fri May 29 02:11:21 2015 UTC,Unfortunately it'll take an actual major conflict for a shift in our operational ideology.   Battleships were replaced by air warfare.   Muskets killed the sword and arrow.   Trench warfare was murdered by air dropped munitions.   Bombers are losing out to deployable guided weapons.   The carrier dies because of what?
navy,37jq23,nightim3,8,Thu May 28 03:57:26 2015 UTC,Subs.   A pair of good subs are more than a match for most CTF's.

navy,37jq23,ThereIsYourProblem,2,Thu May 28 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it would be that much more effective. There are some very sly modern subs, and modern torpedo's have a very long range and are pretty accurate.  Its just not an easy situation to deal with, especially with most of our ASW coming from Helio's or P-3's/P-8's if we are lucky enough to have them.   That SSN might be able to hunt down and kill the sub that attacked the CTF, but that doesn't unsink the carrier or its surface escorts."

navy,37itdb,No-Coast-Punk,5,Thu May 28 01:51:42 2015 UTC,It simply doesn't. You only have to spend at most 30 mins a day doing sets of push ups and situps. Couple that with 30 mins runs twice a week and you could easily get outstanding. Maximum on push ups and sitt-ups and excellent on the run. Easily done.

There is always at least one poster that complains how the PRT isn't fair or they don't have enough time to workout or how difficult the standards are.

The NPC website says that assignments to remote or OCONUS locations are by no means limited by a special needs family member, but the official instruction says that they definitely are. Some clarification is needed there.  Have your sailor log onto NFAAS for a start, there is a module there for enrolling family members into EFMP. I've never heard of an age requirement for bringing a dependent parent over, that sounds like either a command policy or some kind of immigration law, not a Navy instruction."

navy,37ezo7,jou13,-2,Wed May 27 05:48:53 2015 UTC,I just would like to know the standard. Everyone is giving me different answers. I understand what each person is saying but it's basically one word over another. Nobody has told me I'm wrong. I've simply informed them of the regs and carried on. This question was more of a mission to find the standard of what people think is right and wrong.
navy,37ezo7,PathlessDemon,2,Wed May 27 06:13:24 2015 UTC,"Faddish is a subjective term. Yes your sunglasses may have a design that's been around since the 1950's, however, if they detract from the uniform then you can't wear them. The term faddish is used as a catch all in the uniform regs. The whole point of having uniform regs is to present a neat, professional appearance. We all try and skirt the line with certain things, but if you get called out for it then you know where the line is at your command."

navy,37dptn,mpyne,2,Tue May 26 22:08:08 2015 UTC,"I'm still with USAA, but I keep wondering why.  Their policy service is OK, but not great.  Prices have been steadily increasing, and they aren't as easy to deal with than they once were.  For example: they are increasingly redlining areas, for example, the entire state of FL for homeowners.  Maybe if they spent less money on college bowl games and national advertising they could offer better rates."
navy,37dptn,WIlf_Brim,8,Wed May 27 01:41:09 2015 UTC,"USAA was by far the best for me - we bundle and they have the best coverage for our ""stuff"" like computers electronics and jewelry. They also have the best/easiest customer service that I've ever dealt with. It's just a great company."

Everything was handled over the phone, they worked directly with the body shop, and best of all, my rates never raised a penny.  In fact, next month, for whatever reason, they're going down 20 or so bucks.    Geico was cheaper than USAA, but only by a couple bucks.  I may wind up switching to USAA just to bundle up on property insurance and whatnot.  Mainly for the convenience of only having one company to pay.  We'll see."

You can start them on the Geico app.  I've tried switching to USAA insurance, but for us GEICO beats them (just like our Navy Fed car loan came significantly cheaper than USAA) but you've got to shop around.  Disclosure: my wife works for GEICO  so we get extra special scrutiny for insurance fraud."
navy,37dptn,MutFruit,1 point,Wed May 27 01:04:10 2015 UTC,I have used GEICO to make a claim and honestly it was painless and way quicker than i was expecting (same day I was getting my car repaired). I also don't feel like they were trying to dick me around like other insurance companies have in the past. I've been with them for 10 years and every time I need to renew I shop around no one even comes near their price.
navy,37dptn,OldArmyMetal,5,Wed May 27 01:04:38 2015 UTC,USAA is the best coverage.  GEICO or Progressive is probably the best value.

They have nothing to do with admissions.   And if he is lucky enough to get into UT at the last minute, the Navy WILL NOT pay for room and board. They only pay for tuition and a book stipend."
navy,37dnqx,Superkeys,6,Tue May 26 21:37:08 2015 UTC,"The university may pay for room and board, it depends on the school. For example, my school gave free room and board regardless of where you lived (even off campus), but the school to which I was a cross-town affiliate only gave it if you lived on campus."
navy,37dnqx,karenjack241,1 point,Wed May 27 00:51:54 2015 UTC,"Did USAA change their career starter criteria? It was within a year of commissioning for me, not as soon as I got my ID card."
navy,37dnqx,Charlestonian,6,Wed May 27 00:52:12 2015 UTC,"It is possible to transfer the scholarship but it depends on which school he wants to transfer to, if they still have slots available, the whim of the navy, etc. If he wants to do so he needs to contact the NROTC folks in Pensacola ASAP because it may already be too late to put in a transfer request.    NROTC doesn't cover room and board as part of the basic scholarship.  However, some schools do kick in room & board for ROTC scholarship recipients, but that's funding from the university and not NROTC.  He would need to clarify with UT if they are one of the schools that do so.  As for admissions, some detachments do have pull with the school and are able to get a scholarship recipient in even if they didn't go through the regular application process.  His stats must be decent if he won a scholarship and schools are often willing to bend the rules if they're getting a student who will be bringing in full tuition for 4-5 years.  The only way to find out is for him to contact the detachment directly (not a recruiter) and see what they have to say."
navy,37dnqx,hokiesfan,2,Wed May 27 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"This is all correct (well besides Naval has battalions, not detachments, but that's nitpicking).  OP, have your guy call Pensacola right now to get this sorted out.  It's very possible, unfortunately, that you waited too long."

navy,37dnqx,BusterBluth13,2,Tue May 26 21:38:47 2015 UTC,He doesn't want to because it's NOT UT. But the fact of the matter is he doesn't (nor his parents ) have the money for room and board. They was told the scholarship covers it
navy,37dnqx,858,4,Tue May 26 21:53:16 2015 UTC,It's called student loans.   That's pretty much how most Officers make it through college.
navy,37dnqx,Razgriz_,2,Tue May 26 21:54:41 2015 UTC,Exactly. You get a decent paycheck after graduating; using student loans to cover your room and board won't be a big deal in the long run (especially after some financial aid).

If you want actual advice it's easy enough to look up.  I don't believe he actually managed to make it through the application process and was accepted without figuring out he needed to also apply and be accepted to the school.  Have you seen his acceptance letter for the ROTC scholarship? I doubt he actually has one.

navy,37dnqx,BusterBluth13,1 point,Tue May 26 23:49:28 2015 UTC,I went through the biggest fight of my life with my parents over the wording of that section. You can be awarded the scholarship without ever applying to a single school. The difference is that when it comes time to use your scholarship you're dead in the water because you haven't been accepted to the school which the navy is ready to pay for.  Of the 5 schools on my list I applied to 1. Thankfully it worked out. If it didn't I would have been scrambling to apply to the others or requesting that big navy transfer my scholarship to the school I was accepted to.

navy,37cj2m,pepsiredtube,7,Tue May 26 18:19:04 2015 UTC,"This was late 2011. Middle Eastern, Prior Army didn't even make it through basic.  I don't remember his RE code but it requires a waiver while not being automatically disqualifying.  I just handled the paperwork.  The applicant said that he applied for an upgrade and handed me the paperwork. The recruiter, who was easily one of the worst people I've ever known or worked for, refused to disqualify him because he had a high GPA at a good medical school and he wanted to be a doctor.  He told me I would have to find in black and white why he wasn't qualified.  The instruction doesn't specifically mention loyalty to the United States, because why would it? But I was able to disqualify him.  It was moments like that when I hated recruiting and it was fairly stereotypical of recruiting, but I learned he was the exception rather than the rule.  I disqualified him and never heard back from him.  If you have questionable loyalty to the United States,  I don't think you should be in charge of anyone's health."

navy,37cj2m,WIlf_Brim,7,Tue May 26 19:00:59 2015 UTC,"PSA:  After you're out of the military, very few people care about what kind of discharge you got, understand the differences between them, or even ask. Prior service hiring managers might, and certain jobs requiring a security clearance or working for the government will.  You are given two copies of your DD-214, one copy includes this information, the other does not. If you don't get an honorable and someone asks for your DD-214, you just give them the copy without your discharge information. Simple as pie.  As for your VA/GI Bill benefits, you're probably SOL."
navy,37cj2m,Curtis_Low,2,Wed May 27 00:58:12 2015 UTC,Very true.  Don't let it define your entire life.
navy,37cj2m,nowhereian,2,Wed May 27 02:36:34 2015 UTC,Any job that does a background check (which now means almost any job you would want to have) will show that you were discharged with an OTA.
navy,37cj2m,WIlf_Brim,2,Wed May 27 02:02:39 2015 UTC,"There are so many jobs that don't require a clearance.  In fact, unless you are in a military town or working for a government contractor you will never need one.  As someone that lives in a larger city with no real military presence there is no need for a clearance here."
navy,37cj2m,nowhereian,1 point,Wed May 27 23:47:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing that a background check will find it, but I you'll find that the vast majority of employers don't really care or understand what it means.   any job you would want to have   What do you mean by that, exactly?"
navy,37cj2m,Curtis_Low,2,Wed May 27 02:09:38 2015 UTC,"Management level jobs and high level technical jobs (jobs that somebody really wants to have) will require background checks and hiring managers absolutely understand the difference between an honorable and an OTH.  You know who else cares and understands?  Most governments.  An OTH is going to be a real problem if somebody wants to get hired in a state/local/federal government.  And another group?  State license boards.  Anything that requires a license (nurse, dental technician, locksmith, anything) will likely be stopped by an OTH.    Make no mistake: it's a big deal."
navy,37cj2m,Curtis_Low,3,Wed May 27 14:00:18 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm not entirely disagreeing. There are career fields that will be limited. The vast majority of folks who get OTHs don't qualify for these jobs, but not strictly because of the OTH itself.  Think about it. The management and high level technical jobs you're talking about require years of experience, while your average OTH is someone on his/her first or maybe second enlistment.   If you've been in long enough to meet the experience time criteria, you've generally figured out how to keep your act squared away and not get kicked out for diciplinary reasons. Again, generally. Not to mention, there are quite a few reasons you may receive an OTH that are not even problems in the civilian world, for example: fraternization, or in the past, simply being gay.  It's a big deal if you choose to make it one."
navy,37cj2m,haze_gray,2,Wed May 27 23:00:03 2015 UTC,Have OTH... you speak the truth.
navy,37cj2m,club41,2,Wed May 27 23:52:45 2015 UTC,Civilian background check doesn't reveal your discharge.  I have an OTH from 2007 and as long as I don't apply for a government job it doesn't matter at all.  No employer has ever asked for my DD-214 including the job I have now as a Director working for a prior Marine that is now a reserve officer.  People just don't look.  Have OTH and have had it for 8 years now... really not a big deal at all except I can't get military licence plates or work for the government.
navy,37cj2m,BlackSquirrel05,5,Wed May 27 23:52:07 2015 UTC,Sounds like something a sea lawyer would say.
navy,37cj2m,daimii,3,Tue May 26 17:03:22 2015 UTC,"PTSD is the answer to all.  On September 3, 2014, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum providing guidance to the Military Department Boards for Correction of Military/Naval Records (BCM/NR) as they carefully consider each and every petition brought regarding under other than honorable conditions discharge upgrade requests by veterans claiming Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

I just had a sailor whose parents (retired military) tried to use their no-fee and were met by armed guards when their plane landed....they didn't even make it through customs. You'll hear a ton of dependas say ""oh but I flew home and it didn't matter,"" but trust and believe you don't want to go through the effort of planning a trip, spending all that money and time, and then get turned around at customs all because you don't have proper documentation to enter the country. Make sure your insurance is up to date. Generally you can't update or change policies once you're OCONUS. If you have stuff in storage, get a small/cheap policy to cover it. I've been listed as a driver on my insurance for ~6 years while stationed overseas and my insurance rates keep dropping and I keep getting ""good driver refunds"" every year. (bless USAA, bless 'em; their refunds and my policy balance out to $0 spent plus I have a perfect driving record because I haven't driven in the US in forever; edit: I exaggerated a little, but I havecseen a 50% decrease in cost from now compared to when I first came overseas)  The problem with an American phone is no one over at your prospective duty station can call your American number without getting charged a ton. It's not just long distance, it's international. PLUS, you run the risk of being charged roaming, etc. Just suspend your phone and get one over there with a new provider. Depending on the country you may have the option of getting a new SIM card...iPhones generally don't play well with others, though, so good luck with that. Plus, once you get overseas you've got to factor in the shear PITA that it is to contact stateside service. You've got to wait until the middle of the night because of the time difference, set up some VOIP program like skype to call their 1-800 number, get bounced around until you can get to someone who actually has the authority to fix your account, and then hopefully they'll go ahead and suspend your phone without requiring you to track down a fax machine and send them a copy of your orders....which is what literally everyone I know who decided to keep their phone ended up doing after two months OCONUS.  Open a savings account. Set up an allotment; put about $200 a paycheck into it. When it comes time to buy a plane ticket home for leave, you won't be freaking out because you don't have $2k. Find out about your electronics from your sponsor. We had zero problems with ours, except our microwave.....we have to cook a bag of popcorn for like 8 minutes. Generally everything should be good to go or housing can give you a small transformer that will let you draw more power for your important electronics without popping fuses in your house.  Update your seabag. Most OCONUS NEX/AAFES are terribly stocked.   Also, edit: I'm so jealous. I would do almost anything for orders to anywhere Europe."
navy,379xj6,TheBeneGesseritWitch,1 point,Tue May 26 04:16:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much! That's all very helpful.  So the advice on the phone is just to suspend it and get a new phone and with a local carrier? Also, I was planning on selling my car, but if I keep it and and switch over to USAA (which I've been meaning to do) even though I'm not there, just having the car insured and me as the driver the insurance rate drops for having no accidents on record? I just want to clarify that because that sounds like a good deal and a lot of savings in the future."
navy,379xj6,Poopkitty,2,Tue May 26 05:16:09 2015 UTC,"Do you owe on your car? Is it paid for? The government will store it for you for free as a condition of your orders, so if you own it outright, keeping it is probably a much better deal. USAA is great that way - I also keep minimal insurance on my stored/paid-for car. I already had a perfect record anyway, so I can't confirm the deals. ;)"
navy,379xj6,TheBeneGesseritWitch,1 point,Tue May 26 05:24:50 2015 UTC,"I exaggerated a little; I actually had to log into USAA to see what I pay. It's not totally zeroed out, but it's super low. I pay like $350 a year for everything which includes my car (which is a fulky restored classic), renters insurance, my laptop clause (spills, theft, drops), my seabag clause (covers all my uniforms I've ever been issued plus patches and tailoring....you think American Airlines is that generous!?), my wedding ring, and a few other miscellaneous clauses (electronics, jewelry etc). My insurance 7 years ago for my car alone was $300ish for six months. That may be because I was under the magical Young And Invincibles 25 year old threshold, or it may be because I've been accident free for a decade.  Also....when the navy moved me from VA to CA my insurance doubled. So, you numbers may greatly change based on where you are and what you drive. USAA's customer service is amazing. Even if I can get a better deal elsewhere I don't know if I'd switch.   And you asked about being overseas and changing money--usually I can get a cheaper rate withdrawing local currency directly from the atm and letting usaa do the conversion for me, instead of community bank on base or a money exchange in town. Also! The one time I had my card data stolen while in Crete (local mafia monitors the ATMs and will rip your card) USAA put a stop on my account, sent me a new card, refunded the money that was stolen, and this was all done without my knowledge. We were at Rivercity and I got a new card in the mail--that's how I learned I was the victim of attempted credit card theft."

We had an XO who one morning just happened to be taking the shit of his 24 year naval career, while we were cleaning the officer head. Now I noticed the smell and the khaki pants on the floor under the stall. The person I was cleaning with however did not..... preceded to comment on how someone just destroyed this place and that they need fiber etc. We then hear a flush and the jingle of pants being pulled up. The XO comes out of the stall hysterically laughing while I also start laughing my poor FC3 buddy just stands there frozen. He washes his hands and tells us to carry on.  The XO made sure to let both he and I know he was getting his fiber each day after that."
navy,3779e0,00cosgrovep,6,Mon May 25 17:16:51 2015 UTC,Good story that illustrates another overlooked aspect of cranking.  On most platforms the CSs and FSAs who work the wardroom have a golden opportunity to make themselves known to the leadership.  A little care and effort can go a long way and you've set the tone for the rest of your tour.  I've seen caps and NAMs for relatively minor stuff.
navy,3779e0,smokinglamp_throw,3,Mon May 25 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed on this. You get a lot of ""face time"" working in the wardroom or the mess and it can go a long way for your career if you play your cards right."

navy,3779e0,00cosgrovep,4,Mon May 25 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"I was serving dinner once in the Wardroom and had to take a leak so I ran off to the officer head as we were allowed to use it (because I cleaned it, so fuck you).  That month we had a full compliment of senior riders from DESRON and other places with a lot of extra brown shoe aviators.  It was also rough as a mugg that day and being a top heavy CG, we were swaying left and right as only a CG can do.  I got to the head and saw all four stall doors closed and four pair of brown shoes facing the wrong way doing the technicolor yawn.  Ended up using the ""battle pisser"", the deep sink in the cleaning gear locker but it gave me quite a laugh."
navy,3779e0,chillbull,4,Mon May 25 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"Cranked for three months in the wardroom when I first got to my ship as an E-4 and then again for about a month a while later in the main scullery. The division was all push buttons so anyone below E-5 had to take their turn(s). Some stuff I remember:     1: Cranked from 0500 to 1900. Then my normal shop calls berthing to say my system is down (the one I've never actually worked on)(Oh and we are on deployment). Troubleshoot system from 1900 to 0500 and am fairly sure what the problem is. Order the part (12K) and wait for supply to do their thing. Go back to cranking for the 0500 breakfast and get part about half way though lunch 1230ish. Have to go aloft while underway (on a DD) to fix. Run all the aloft stuff(more time). Yep, got to climb to the top of the ship after being awake 34ish hours and getting blasted by exhaust from the stacks, wind trying to blow shit out of your hands, and the boat rocks quite a bit at the top. Good times. 2: When I was cranking in the wardroom there was a MS2 in charge that used to try to make the cranks do dumb shit (like making the officers beds) to make himself look good. He made it known that he was overweight when he was a kid and seemed touchy about it. There was a window to pass food from the kitchen to the wardroom and the kitchen phone was right next to the window. I used to go to the wardroom phone and call the kitchen phone. When he answered I would say "" you""re a big fat pig"" and then make pig noises, while watching through the window. He would get soooo pissed off. I'd stroll in a few minutes later to inquire why he was so upset. Childish? Sure but entertainment was hard to come by back then.(1995ish)"

navy,3779e0,scttydsntknw85,3,Tue May 26 16:40:58 2015 UTC,"I did one and a half months, after one and half years on my first ship. I was an MM3 at the time,the rest of my time got hand waived because I got pulled back to the pit for an inspection. I did a couple weeks in the galley/messdecks proper then my buddy who was the CS3 in charge of the chief mess pulled some strings.  I was late the first day working there. It was a weekend in port so I was going to be the only one there for a few hours.The CS2 in charge of the messdecks was salty that I ( one of the better workers ) was being ""taken"" from him so he kept me til 2200 and I needed to open the mess at 0600.   I got to see who really ran the mess that day when I barreled in and got a impromptu ass chewing by seven hungry chiefs. I got to witness the CSCS waltz in a listen to what was going on and then turn to the other chiefs and tell them to bugger off that breakfast will be served shortly. He took me back into the small galley and i prepared for the worst and he said "" fire up the grill and go get some eggs and steak from the main galley we are gonna cook feed these babies so they stop whining.""  I was flabbergasted and slightly on guard because I was waiting for the ass chewing that i knew was coming.  We served breakfast and he told me to relax as I sat down he told me. "" I heard CS2 was giving you shit, I had told him to let you go at a reasonable time I will have words with him later""  All in all though the experience was great my best friend was cranking with me and I got to get out of the hole for a little bit."

navy,3779e0,sw337,3,Tue May 26 03:50:46 2015 UTC,"I disagree, it makes no sense to have someone who spent two years in schools to have a specific job work for 3-6 months in food service. It is one of those things no one could ever give a good answer for why we still did it. I get people have to peel potatoes and constantly clean, that is why I signed up to do something else."
navy,3779e0,smokinglamp_throw,8,Mon May 25 17:35:23 2015 UTC,"Side story #27....STG buddy of mine DESPISED the whole idea of cranking and on our ship at that time, you did not have to crank if you were E-5 or had your ESWS pin.  Most even did it as an E-4, but there was enough churn where some push-buttons skated out of cranking entirely.  So my buddy finally gets the call as an E-4 and on day one, breaks out his ESWS book and hits it hard.  His inhuman non-sleeping ability + sheer brain power got his book signed and through all the boards in record time....like sub 30 days back in 1992ish....damn impressive.  He takes his final board and the favorite and always known last question from the CMC was, ""So why did you go through all this to get your ESWS?"".  Mind you, this was back in the ESWS is voluntary days where it got you +2 exam points and you could often see Chiefs without their pins.  So my buddy being the straight shooter he is said, ""I hate cranking and this gets me out of it"".  He cranked for 2 more weeks until the CMC called him into the mess and handed him his pin.  No ceremony, no fanfare, no 1MC announcement.  3 days later, he was off cranking."
navy,3779e0,Esuu,4,Mon May 25 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"While I agree it was not an optimal use of your training and skillset, cranking is not really a good use of the CS's either.  Nobody goes through a training pipeline to learn how to clean things.  That's basic sailoring.  Fortunately, nubs (any rate) are useless bodies until they qualify something.  Problem solved.  As a bonus, the FSA gets:   Strong motivation to become useful to his division ASAP A buffer period where he is the ""new guy"" and can make friends and learn the ship An appreciation for good manners and not trashing the ship we call home"
navy,3779e0,smokinglamp_throw,1 point,Mon May 25 17:55:05 2015 UTC,"While I agree it was not an optimal use of your training and skillset, cranking is not really a good use of the CS's either. Nobody goes through a training pipeline to learn how to clean things. That's basic sailoring.   Except CSs doing the same job would at least be learning things about their rate and division while doing the shit work. I just finished cranking a few months ago and I learned a decent amount about how the galley functions, how stores work, the procedures/etiquette of the wardroom, and the politics of S-2 among other things.   This knowledge would be valuable to a new CS but is completely useless to me since I likely won't be cranking again.  IIRC they're testing out a new system on one of the carriers where they just have a lot more CSs and no more FSAs, which makes a lot more sense to me. It may be something that can only really work on a big deck because of manning issues but I don't know enough about that to know one way or the other.  I feel like tradition and ""I suffered through it so you do to"" are the main driving factors behind cranking still being around but that might just be my junior sailor showing."
navy,3779e0,daimii,5,Mon May 25 22:26:49 2015 UTC,"Cranking is Food Service division work, but not CS work. Cranks are basically on TAD to the division.  If you ever see FSAs being forced to do CS work you need to bring those concerns to the attention of the FSO or SUPPO immediately.  There are regulations that explicitly delineate what FSAs can and cannot do.  Shipboard sanitation and food safety is no joke.  Poorly handled food can sicken a crew and force a ship off station.  If I were a CO I would want the A-Ganger who is gassing the reefer to have seen that space loaded and inventoried before; I would want the sonar tech on the chow line to notice if something looks wrong with today's fish.  Like basic DC this is a responsibility we all share and leaving it up to the CSs and HMs is the wrong answer.  If we replaced every FSA with a CS or civilian there wouldn't be enough racks for all the extra bodies.  It's possible that the next generation of carriers and large surface combatants could incorporate extra racks, but that's still decades away and most platforms are far too small for that to be practical.  Hell, SSNs are already undermanned and hotracking.  Even if we had the extra racks I would argue that taking on more junior CSs is a poor use of that space.  There are always new junior personnel on board who are not much use to their divisions yet.  If for some bizarre reason a nubly Seaman is vital to his division their Chief or DIVO talks to FSO and they'll make an arrangement.  There is literally no reason not to use them.  I understand that nobody wants to get their hands dirty these days, but this is not another form of arbitrary hazing and I'm not arguing for the sake of tradition.  The cranking system serves a purpose.  We should think long and hard before we change ship designs and the CS advancement pyramid to accommodate everyone's hurt feelings.  Nobody - not even CSs - signed up to be a potato peeler.  But the potatoes still need to be peeled."

navy,376oji,Hadeshorne,1 point,Mon May 25 11:03:46 2015 UTC,Because it kicks the can down the road 30 years. The Berry needs repairs due to 30 years of neglect while sitting alongside a dock. The Samuel B. should be in much better shape as a ship that was in active service up until a few days ago.
navy,376oji,weinerpretzel,1 point,Mon May 25 20:13:32 2015 UTC,"The Sea Cadet unit I used to volunteer with would get to use the Berry for training. It was sad when we had to stop them going due to safety issues, understandable though.   Last I talked to the base CO he did want to keep the Berry but they just couldn't find the money for the upkeep. At the time he didn't think a new ship was going to come but hey things could change.  As long as the thing can fit under the bridge."
navy,376oji,camelpope,1 point,Tue May 26 13:59:42 2015 UTC,"Sounds like everyone wants to keep the Barry there, but the Navy hasn't forked over the funding or manpower to keep it in serviceable condition. It's a hazard now and they do need to move it before the bridge goes in, that seems clear.  I think the Roberts would be a good fit. It would have to be in place before the bridge as well, but I think it's almost critical that Washington Navy Yard has a ship at the pier. Our Navy is all about tradition, pomp and circumstance, etc, and having this ship posted in the river outside our Capital seems the right thing to do. Obviously, having a larger ship there would be awesome too, like one of our battleships, but this seems a reasonable solution.  Sidenote: I wonder if they've considered landlocking either ship, like they are doing with the USS Texas?"

navy,376cit,spitpilot,3,Mon May 25 06:26:26 2015 UTC,"I like the idea but I can see easy ways for the Navy to tube this up hard and unintentionally destroy morale. I hope that leadership thinks carefully about how to tailor the need for retention of skills in general with the need to reward our top performers. Note I didn't say ""incentivize top performance"" since a lot of research shows that reward systems don't necessarily improve performance, and there are even examples of reward systems harming performance.  Likewise a performance-based bonus requires a good way to evaluate performance, which I'm not sure that our current forced-distribution performance evaluation system is in alignment with. It's easy to say we should reward our EPs, but the ""rock star"" sailor force-distributed into an MP (or worse, a P) is going to see that as them being screwed out of a bonus.  That wouldn't be as big a problem if the current performance evaluation were followed strictly by the letter of the regs (i.e. an independent evaluation of performance every cycle without reference to what was marked in previous cycles). Doing that would require a significant cultural shift as well."

navy,376cit,ChuckFinleyFL,1 point,Tue May 26 00:47:10 2015 UTC,"I've seen another side effect: you, in general, shouldn't give a sailor a high performance mark if he/she's still early in his tour, because if a couple of A. J. Hotshots shows up after that sailor then you might in theory have to bump that EP you give on their first eval to an MP (if we're being fair), and doing that is seen as an adverse report, even if their performance didn't actually decline.  Alternately, you'd have to screw one of the Hotshots out of their ""fair"" EP even though their performance warranted it in that cycle."

If so, how do you make it fair and balanced for the Sailors who were forced into the MP or P spots? For example: even though ET1 is a better Sailor and out did MM1 in every way, MM1 is still senior and is up for Chief and had an EP last cycle and it would kill his career if he slipped to an MP this cycle. Oh, and EM1 and STG1 just made E6 last cycle and are frocked, even though they would have been our 2nd Class EPs and now are just getting PS when ranked with all of the other First Classes. Oh, and GM1 just transferred in with an EP transfer EVAL so does he get a bonus or since he's still NOB should the Navy just discount his hard work at his last command?

The USAF struggles with this issue already, anything less than a 5.0 is just another way of saying ""this airman is a dirtbag"".  This is the whole reason limits are set in the first place, is to (try) and force reporting seniors to rank their sailors. The problem, of course, is that relative rankings of sailors at a given command is not in any way the same as ranking those same sailors across the Navy as a whole.

But we caught the next flight the next day no problem.  Edit: I wouldn't fly space a for anything domestic, unless you have a few days on each end to wait for a flight, the price of airfare (low IMO) makes space a less attractive for domestic. There are 6 categories. Active duty leave personnel are cat 3, and anyone traveling with you maintains your category assuming they are a dependent (spouse or children). I've never met a cat 1 or 2 traveling and cat 4-6 are rare as well. If you sign up as soon as you go on leave your chances of getting a flight are good.

I was diagnosed with lymphocytic colitis last year (hit 13 years in the Navy this week) and am currently going through the PEB process to see if I can stay in. Most likely I am going to be told its time to go home. It sucks but the Navy will take care of you with either a med sep or med retirement and you will get VA disability. I wanted to finish my 20 but sometimes things don't go according to plan. Make sure you go to medical and get referred to a GI. If it goes untreated for too long it can lead to losing part of your intestines.

navy,36z8oe,AgentOfZion,8,Sat May 23 11:19:00 2015 UTC,It's sad that my command is one of the people that do this. Sometimes they will even create an award for that sailor to advance. It never happened to me. I was stuck as a seaman for 3.5 years before I finally made third off a 25% exam
navy,36z8oe,kylergoedert,2,Sat May 23 11:53:22 2015 UTC,"Six exams under my belt here. Can confirm, I've seen it happen too. Guess hard work doesn't actually pay off anymore."

navy,36z8oe,BurningBushes2000,3,Sat May 23 14:16:22 2015 UTC,Taking the late exam fucks the sailor even more. If it was between taking the exam without awards and the late one definitely take the one without awards. The late screws over the sailor even more.
navy,36z8oe,BurningBushes2000,0,Sat May 23 16:08:33 2015 UTC,"In what way? It's built from the same bibs isn't it?  I mean, I know it is anecdotal but I've had two people advance off the late exam."
navy,36z8oe,signah,5,Sat May 23 16:18:53 2015 UTC,Because when you take the late exam the Final Required Multiple Score is already set and your exam isn't scored on a curve against all the other eligible sailors. The Final Multiple is set and your exam is going to be scored BASED (Opposed to actually being part of the group graded on a curve) on the curve set by the early test taken applicants and then your final is compared to those who took the regular exam. You will be missing out on being part of the group of applicants who set the curve and final multiple which can greatly reduce your chances of promoting.

navy,36z8oe,ChuckFinleyFL,3,Sat May 23 16:22:15 2015 UTC,"While I sympathize with everything you're saying, sometimes it's not so easy to get your record updated. I have submitted every single one of my awards on 3 separate occasions and to this day no database (FLTMPS, NDAWS, OMPF etc) agrees. And none of the have the correct number of NAMs for me. So at least sometimes it's not the sailors fault."

The Chinese navy repeatedly warned the U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon plane to leave airspace around disputed islands in the South China Sea. ""Foreign military aircraft, this is Chinese navy. You are approaching our military alert zone. Leave immediately,"" a Chinese naval officer warned the U.S. plane, ""Your action is unfriendly and dangerous. Please go away quickly.""

China is doing this because of the TPP treaty Obama is trying to pass. This is there way of trying to throw a wrench into the cogs. America is pushing back. America is stuck between a rock and a hard place. They can't force China out (that would mean world war 3 and the complete destruction of our economy) but they can't let China set up bases where they are. Economic pressure will not work. Force cannot be used. What can we do?  China is trying to protect it's economy by blocking the trade routes. If Obama just lets this go, it will set a precedence that will lead to war down the road. This is more dangerous than the news is covering. China threatens to destabilize the entire south China sea. Really scary."
navy,36y7mk,Gaming_Loser,2,Sat May 23 09:35:23 2015 UTC,I agree. It boils down to China pushing smaller countries around to take resources. I think the TPP scared them that America will have alot more influence in the region then they wanted.
navy,36y7mk,BurningBushes2000,2,Sat May 23 12:03:18 2015 UTC,Actually no. It comes down to China's claim on the 9 Dash line and goes back hundreds of years. This was going on long before Obama and the Treaty.

navy,36x7o6,XDingoX83,8,Sat May 23 02:54:05 2015 UTC,Sucks when you know more about your rate (or can demonstrate that on an exam) than people getting advanced. Time in pay grade/awards/PNA seems to be about the same but Eval is way off. Whats going on there? Fix that and you will excel and the recent people advanced will be working for you soon enough.
navy,36x7o6,chillbull,4,Fri May 22 23:18:53 2015 UTC,"That is actually based on a transfer eval. What happened was that my EMCS retired and a new EMC replaced him. During this entire time, I was in the galley as a FSA. So, when I got back to my division, I got the news that we were now over-manned and three of us had to leave. I got picked as one of the lucky three (after being back for two days) and, in his own words, ""You haven't ever worked for me, so I can't really justify anything over a P.""

No idea why, I was a great asset to my work center.  Old MMC talked to new MMC to get my eval changed, but couldn't.  Wouldn't sign the eval, got labeled a shitbag.  Then, when I was transferring out, didn't get the NAM because new RO decided transferring wasn't a reason to get one.  I was one of three dudes that didn't get one before someone convinced him that he was fucking the advancement chances of everyone leaving his command.  My buddy that came to my ship a couple of months later got one.  But, fuck him, I still made first in 5 and would flip him off as I was walking to the front of the chow line on the regular."

They ""scaled down the impact of evals"" for lower ranks, but they did it with the same difference in points between evals, meaning the fms just went down a bit and evals still make the exact same impact on advancement they did before vs others.

navy,36vk4o,chillbull,4,Fri May 22 22:58:26 2015 UTC,"That's generally correct. There was a huge banner that wrapped around one of the p-ways that had the whole history and timeline of FFG-58 and the mine strike (you can see the CO looking at it in the first video) and there was also a power point presentation that would get shared that talked more about Samuel B. Roberts' history and the ships that were named after him.  After all the new people had time to study, we would do a ceremony on the flight deck where the CMC would step in front of each person and ask a few questions like, ""What does the ""B"" in Samuel B. Roberts stand for?"" or ""Where do we get the motto 'No Higher Honor'?"" Things like that. If you answered enough questions correctly he would hand you a ball cap and then move to the next person. After everybody had a ball cap in their hands, they'd give the order and you'd switch out your Navy or prior command ball cap and put on the Sammy B ball cap.  Sometimes it would take a while depending on how many new people we had, but I always thought it was a very cool way to do it."

There are so many cases on these boards where people talk about how they had some kind of medication for mental health issues in their adolescent years, but are now fine. It seems to me that doctors were just haphazardly prescribing medication for kids going through puberty.   I completely understand the Navy's stance on this: if someone needs drug treatment for their mental health then it has to be taken as a sign that some kind of mental health aliment existed. We've got to cover our asses as an organization; but more importantly, as parents we need to re-evaluate what is a serious mental condition, and what is just growing pains. If your kid is having a shitty day maybe there is a better solution than giving them a pill. Off my soapbox now."

I had my future and my new family to support, so unfortunately practicality took place over strict morality in this instance  I wish I had not been forced to make the decision, but I have to go forward and live authentically by owning anything that may come from that choice.

That being said, NROTC is competitive but I wouldn't worry about any kind of minority status. Even if it's easier to get it as a minority it's not exactly something you can change about yourself, is it?  If you're no-shit dead set on becoming a naval officer you should apply Tier 1.  If you don't receive it you should go to a university that offers Naval ROTC and be a college program Midshipman. You do the program without any kind of financial incentive but you have a few shots to pick up a commissioning track during your first two years of college.

navy,36pavx,LilSassy,20,Thu May 21 01:25:30 2015 UTC,"As a Chief Warrant Officer you are considered to be the master of your craft, and not only through the eyes of the Enlisted personnel you lead but to the Officers both senior and junior to you.   Being a Warrant provides you with new resources and abilities you most likely wouldn't have as Senior Enlisted member or possibly even as an LDO. You're able to support, teach, and lead your crew how you see fit while delegating orders and procedures down and perhaps even creating or changing the way things are done in your rate entirely.   In my opinion, pay and seniority should be some of the last reasons to apply for Officer positions. We all know they come with the job but if you have the opportunity to be a leader for the many enlisted that follow and look up to you, I hope you're there for a reason that isn't affiliated with your bank account because that's not leading and weak leadership is something I've always despised most.  Just my two cents"

Didn't play typical officer politics.  As a LDO, we usually socialized well, since both LDOs and WOs are much older than the other junior officers in the wardroom.  Many had to invoke ""save pay"" because a senior chief becoming a W1 would otherwise be a pay cut."

But when you're in your 30's and officers are making almost double your pay per month it becomes very appealing to go that route. Money isn't everything but financial security sure does make life a whole lot easier.   At the end of the day NO ONE is going to care about your service when you leave the military. There are hundreds of thousands of retirees. Your retirement pension is what is going to support you and your family and the higher the better.

As for your husband, he's going to have to support you. I'm in an LDR right now and we both support each other no matter where. I was stationed in Cali while he's in Guam. It works. It depends on how you two want to work it out. I find it stupid that you're trying to drop out just so you could be with family. Maybe you shouldn't have signed up at all. You knew what you signed up for, so pretty much deal with it.  Other than that, have fun in the CAL field as I work up on the flight deck, in the heat."

I don't have any advice really but I understand how important being with your SO is. 2 months of bootcamp was hell being away from my husband and daughter. Luckily for my my husband is a civilian so my family's relocation was easy.  Recruiters and RTCs often tell you things that aren't true that get your hopes up, just to have big navy smash them to smithereens.  Definitely talk to your instructors. They can give you a lot more real advice.   hugs  hope you get this figured out!"
navy,36o0c6,weinerpretzel,1 point,Sun May 24 21:57:36 2015 UTC,"I understand. We had a few guys in my class that really struggled. And I mean REALLY struggled. I'm talking taking the max amount of time on every assignment and test during the last few blocks. But they all got through. One of the Marines in day check was probabably actually a rock in marpat and he passed. The schoolhouse wants you to pass. I think I only saw two people leave while I was there, and one was directly related to an NJP. But look, calibration is tits. The job is easy, the workcenters are climate controlled, you've got all of the benefits of being in AIMD, but separtated enough to avoid most of the bullshit, you almost never have to use NALCOMIS....  Just push through. You'll be glad you did. I haven't met a single cal tech yet that had a problem with the job. Even the most anti-Navy joes admitted that the job itself was great.  As a cherry on top, if you decide to stick it out and re-enlist, you can STAR re-enlist to go BACK to Biloxi for advanced cal school, live in the per diem housing, and put on E-5 afterwards if you haven't picked it up yet. It's a good deal. It's a great deal. You really don't want to pass it up."

I guess I'm a lifer too but I treat the navy as a 9-5 and don't put too much effort because at the end of the day, the Navy doesn't love you back.   It really isn't that bad an idea. If you're just here for college money or something to do for a few years then go for it. Why be miserable in something that isn't your career? I'd just go to the instructors and tell them that you don't want to go C school and that if you continue you'd fail. That is what I did and transparency is usually valued.   I quit my first job in the Navy because it fucking sucked and I figured I would be miserable living away from my spouse and dont plan on staying in. I Got sent to live with her and haven't been happier.   Remember at the end of the day it's just a job.  The Navy isn't going to be there for you, your spouse is. Family is more important than anything else. No one is going to give a fuck about you being in the Navy when you get out but your husband will always be there."

That is what I did and transparency is usually valued.   This is good advice, packaged really poorly. Speak to your instructors, if you fail on purpose you are not going to have a good time. If you speak to the instructors honestly you will probably still end with the same orders but you have a chance of making what you want to happen."
navy,36o0c6,hearshot,2,Wed May 20 23:36:31 2015 UTC,"I am not a lifer and have been out for three years.   I think the reason it is a dumb idea is because somewhere in the fleet there is a command who is waiting to have a CAL tech arrive. They have already seen the orders get filled, hopefully they started to make the appropriate steps happen to ensure said success. Not only is she trying to sabotage her career with this, but she is essentially screwing a command out of having the qualified people it requires to function properly. Sure.. it may not seem like a big deal right now but when the shelves start filling with out of cal tools and equipmentyou will start seeing a ton of NRFI parts sitting on shelves or getting sent to other places. This could be prevented had the command checked in a freshly trained yet obviously green tech who could help lessen the load.   The fact is this. She signed up knowing that the Navy is all around the world. If she cannot find a balance to her personal life and Navy life then she chose wrong. Sometimes you just have to eat the shit sandwich you are served.  Maybe she will answer this.. What is keeping your husband from moving with you?"

Especially if she's just going to go fill a 0000 billet at the ultimate duty station.    The Navy isn't going to be there for you, your spouse is. Family is more important than anything else. No one is going to give a fuck about you being in the Navy when you get out but your husband will always be there.    Absolutely this. It takes so much work to maintain a marriage, and even more work to maintain a dual military marriage. A good spouse will help support your career. My husband has my back, and I've got his, and we are both trying to help each other meet the demands the Navy has made of us."
navy,36o0c6,BurningBushes2000,-3,Thu May 21 01:00:41 2015 UTC,"Yea but the navy isn't forced to follow the co location instruction, at all, ever.  The instruction is more or less to make people feel good. On top of that she is coming out of training so the instruction specifically states that co location isn't required.   I would do whatever it took to get co located even if it meant failing out. If she's only a 5 and dive one contract sailor it won't her career at all since this isn't her career."

How about focusing on issues that matter like fleet readiness and training and killing bad guys? You know, the shit the Navy has been good at since 1775."

Also, in places like Afghanistan which have highly patrichorical societies, the local women will not speak to men who are outside the home. Also, with ISIL agents in Africa, we need people who speak the languages and know the culture, because if you followed me to the homestead, you would stick out like a sore thumb.   We need diversity to accomplish our war fighting mission, shipmate, its why I have to be on a recal list in case Boko Haram does fun things."
navy,36m7qn,Ryand-Smith,0,Wed May 20 21:27:05 2015 UTC,"Because the navy is currently not good at diversity and gender balance--why should she waste time focusing on something we already have mastered?   I will speak plainly: the navy needs to improve how it treats women. Look at how polarizing women's issues are in this sub. Perfect example--the giant uproar when it was announced that women will get 12 weeks to convalesce after having a baby (to align with federal standard). It amazes me how quickly this sub turned the issue of convalescing after having a baby into ""paternity leave long enough, it isn't fair.""  Male centered! If my voice isn't male, it is hard to be heard.   We are getting there, the navy is, but issues that are important to me, as a woman, aren't really heard clearly. So it is refreshing to see a woman in a position where, after custom ordering female shoulder boards with her fourth star, she can bring about change and be a voice for the rest of us."

We never will, it's a constant battle. Yes, we need to get better at diversity and gender balance, but we're a navy first. Our job is to stand in harms way to protect the homeland/civilians. Currently as it stands, I'm pretty sure we're gonna get royally fucked if push comes to shove with someone that had a blue water force.  Granted, I think it's mostly because of another issue besides the 5 currently brought up, so that's something else, but fleet readiness (Half of the ship is broken at any one time), training (Changes depending on who is giving it, and we're pretty sure we're gonna have to get shot before we can return fire without going to mast), and killing the bad guys (I dunno here. I don't have a whole hell of a lot of faith here in anyone I don't personally know to get their job done.)  So yes, go diversity, go gender balance, go all that happy ""we're all good"" stuff, but can we please add some damn teeth back to the Navy?"
navy,36m7qn,Ryand-Smith,1 point,Wed May 20 23:27:45 2015 UTC,"Why are you assuming that gender balance and diversity means we'll lose our ""teeth""?  America's Navy is by far the most powerful. We've got more ships, more sailors, more aircraft, more power than any other country. Combine the next five or six countries' warfare capabilities and you still don't come close to equaling what we've got.   The truth is, if push comes to shove with any other blue water force in the world, we aren't going to ""get royally fucked.""   This article was posted a few weeks ago and her third point sums this whole argument up very succinctly:   The military is a homogeneous, anti-intellectual organization. ...the factor that I found most frustrating is the toxicity of a perpetually anti-intellectual, change-resistant organization. My given reasons for resigning are extremely common among junior officers — both men and women — and have been recently quantified by the 2014 Navy Retention Study...When I was a week into my first deployment, I was preparing my slides for a watch turnover brief as the assistant chiefs of staff all filed in. A fellow junior officer, whose watch station was adjacent to mine, muttered, “Man, the Navy has a never-ending supply of middle-aged white men.” And she was absolutely right. The majority of senior military leaders are white, Christian, conservative men with engineering degrees from a service academy, masters’ degrees from a war college, who grew up middle-class or privileged and whose wives do not have a career outside the home. There is nothing wrong with any of this — indeed, this is probably the profile of most executives in America. But this also means there’s a lack of diversity of ideas, a resistance to alternative ways of thinking, and the lethality of group think...In order to succeed as an organization that is in the business of outsmarting and out-maneuvering an adversary who wants to kill us and our allies, shouldn’t we encourage diversity of thought in the force, and strive to recruit and retain leaders who think differently, rather than writing them off as disruptive?"
navy,36m7qn,Kailuafornia,3,Thu May 21 00:44:44 2015 UTC,"Now I simply will disagree with that, because even in my field, which is probably the second most least diverse field (nuclear, i have been told sf is the worst about that), the diversity is increasing in fits, but that article is the most, god she makes us millenials look super entititled, the military is not fun or easy)"

I was meaning that we shouldn't stress one or two things over everything else. Stress all the things so none get left behind. Focusing on diversity and gender balance kind of kills the idea of diversity.  I agree that we need more out of the box thinking and it needs to stop being squashed so much by knee jerk reactions. Hell, the knee jerk reactions need to go away too.  Also, power doesn't mean shit if we don't know how to use it. You honestly think the first USN ship fired on in the outbreak of the next war is going to survive? That the chain isn't going to freeze up and wait to see exactly what those incoming planes or ships are going to do? Maybe it's just me, but I don't see it. I see them getting locked up in their PPRs, unable to deal or to take responsibility for doing what is going to be needed to defend the ship.  Granted, we'll come back.

You have to be eligible for BAH in order to get DLA. We had an E5 requesting advance DLA from his previous command and they wouldn't grant it to him because according to the JTR, E6 and below on shore duty are not automatically guaranteed BAH--and the gaining command would not issue a statement to his previous command guaranteeing he'd be living off base. Additionally: you have 60 days from receipt of DLA to show you moved into off base housing. If you're not guaranteed BAH, your departing command should not give it to you. You need to read the JTR before making broad sweeping statements about pay entitlements.   Besides, if you take an advance you only get 80%. Just wait and claim it at the end of your travel with your travel claim.   Edit: DLA calculator and faq"

navy,36n6pm,DearSergio,-2,Wed May 20 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"DLA is money you do not have to pay back. You have to get a letter of non availability in order to receive DLA. Of they pay you DLA but you're able to get to an NGIS or move in right away, then you'll have to pay is back when you do your travel claim.   Does that make sense? If you move to your next command and they don't have any room at NGIS, govt housing, or authorized hotels, you get DLA and don't have to pay it back. But you need a letter in your transfer package that says that."
navy,36n6pm,TheBeneGesseritWitch,2,Wed May 20 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"This is incorrect.   You're thinking of TLA, Temporary Lodging Allowance, which is very different from DLA.  DLA is Dislocation Allowance, and yes, it is free money and you don't have to pay it back. You have 60 days from checking into your new command to file a DLA claim, or to file a DLA closeout statement if you took an advance. If you took an advance and don't file your closeout statement the Navy will recoup that money with extreme prejudice. Additionally, part of that closeout claim is showing you are living in housing on the local economy (not base housing).   The only time you would be required to have a letter of nonavailability is if you're not eligible for BAH/OHA and you are requesting an advance on your DLA. Your gaining command must give your leaving command a statement saying you aren't going into the BEQ (due to nonavailability) so that they can authorize you to get an advance on your DLA."

navy,36lt1l,eaturliver,3,Wed May 20 09:36:29 2015 UTC,"Are you an HM3 now? I'd recommend you go one to two pay grades up - you need to make E-5 and E-6 before you make Chief. Don't put the cart before the horse.  Find someone who is doing the job well, is up to date on quals, and shadow them. Ask advice. You want someone honest, not a friend necessarily (although they will likely become one) - but someone with whom you share interests and goals. Look for someone who was only recently in your life stage. Don't ask a Sailor ten years older with 3 kids when you're 20 and single. You need someone who understands where you are now, and where you want to be."
navy,36lt1l,Poopkitty,3,Wed May 20 12:09:38 2015 UTC,"Ahhh mentorship.  So essentially what you'll PROBABLY end up doing is what most everyone else is.   Find someone who won't make you look bad by association. Doesn't matter who, so long as they are alive and will be at the command for a long while. Congrats you have an ""on-paper"" mentor. Now go ahead and ignore that person except for the mandatory paperwork updates every time DITS comes around (or whatever the equivalent is at your command).  Now you have some breathing room to find an ACTUAL mentor. Here is a list of some qualities that may be useful to you.  1.) Not intimidating. Hard to get a useful conversation if you are afraid to talk.  2.) Profecient in rate. A mentor doesn't necessarily need to know anything about your rate, but how good will they be if they suck at their job?  3.) Understanding of your goals. If you just want to get a GI Bill and peace out, you need someone who isn't going to turn every single meeting into a re-enlistment sale.  4.) They should not be your friend. Friends are great for whining to and hanging out with. Friends are not good at holding you accountable for your shit or seeing things objectively.  5.) Experienced in the navy. Rank is not equivalent to experience. A 12 year EN2 could be a better mentor than a 6 year AG1. Having someone outside your chain to help find an instruction is great. Having someone who knows how the instruction actually gets applied is better.  6.) Different enough from you that you can get a separate perspective on everything. The more angles you have to see a painting, the clearer it looks right?   At the end of the day though, the best mentors are the ones that you don't realize were influencing you until about two months after they transfer. Find mentorship where you can, and don't stress out about the formalities of things. Everyone has different strengths you can pull some use from."

navy,36lt1l,TheBeneGesseritWitch,1 point,Wed May 20 11:04:15 2015 UTC,"(I am assuming you are an HN or HM3?) Ask around for the most squared away second class. She doesn't have to be in your department or even the same rate. That sailor that everyone--junior and senior ranks--says is the most squared away, that is the one you want to ask to be your mentor.   A mentor isn't a binding contract even though some commands try to make it seem that way. My protégés are on different ships, although I have three in my command as well. You want a lot of them. Collect them like Pokemon.   I've never had much success with mentors who were more than two paygrades above me. I think it's because the focus is so different. The goal is your next immediate paygrade, and there's often a disconnect between E8 to E1. I'm not saying Chiefs and firsts can't give good mentorship to HNs and HN3, but you also want your mentor to be approachable and for you to connect with them. You aren't going to have the same easy going camaraderie with a chief or confide in them as readily when there is that big rank gap. Can you see yourself going to with them to lunch or coffee to talk about whatever issue you're having? You don't get to the top rung of a ladder by jumping, you have to spend time on each rung on your way up. Asking someone who is one rung above you to help pull you up to their level is going to be much more effective than asking someone five rings above you to pull you up to the next rung. That's the best analogy I can come up with...  I look for sailors who have lived the situation I've lived or am trying to live. Dual mil, kids, being a female in a male dominated rate, LDO? Suddenly you just became a very interesting person to me."
navy,36lt1l,Titus142,1 point,Wed May 20 11:49:40 2015 UTC,Need to find one you get along with and will actually have the time and drive to be a mentor. Forced mentor programs end up being just an admin check in the box. Take the time to find someone who will d what you need. My best mentor as an e5 was a chief who was about my age (28 at the time) and we had similar personally and goals. He was a great sounding board and had lost of experience to share.

We processed him out in about 90 days as IIRC COs are on a strict timeline (unless they submit an op waiver that gets approved) to start the process rolling.    Since you failed the BCA you are entitled to involuntary separation pay, minus any SRBs,etc. When you would get the money, I have no idea. I can tell you know is the time to start looking for work, saving money as the odds are you only have less than 90 days left on active duty.

navy,36n9vl,Coneheart,2,Wed May 20 20:31:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you are stationed. Depending on rate, there's usually work around the bases / shipyards and the like. Check out usajobs.com and see what's available in your area for whatever quals you have.  Merchant Marine is a thing if you don't mind the deployments and can get a berth on a ship, from what I understand prior ship board Navy experience helps.  Don't wait to talk to people on usajobs, most understand that you're still in and if they can wait, there's a chance they'll hold the job for you.  Your wife might have to look into a job if she doesn't have one already. Kinda sucks, but if she can find a job in the next couple months to get some extra income coming in, that can float you along a bit while you job hunt if it takes longer than your terminal.  Dunno what else to tell you without knowing your rate / location.  EDIT: Also, honestly, your CFL made so many mistakes there's a chance you could even fight it via Legal. Has the CFL even been to the CFL school? If they haven't it's not a valid PRT, there must be a fully-qualified CFL present at all PRT events."

It is absolutely my fault for not keeping myself in physical standards, but I failed two BCA's prior to this most recent PRT. He told me that BCA failures and PRT failures don't correlate with each other, and you have to have either three BCA failures or three PRT Failures to be processed out, not any combination thereof. And on the day of the run, I was sick (I have documentation from medical) and he showed me my time to beat (14:45). I ran in a 13:45. Turns out, the time he showed me was for ""high altitude"" and I failed. Not only was I thinking that I passed with that time, I was worried about one failure anyways because I've never failed the PRT portion of the PFA anyways.

It is an animal instinct to expend as little energy as possible for maximum reward. The trout won't survive if he sits in the current. The same thing is true with people.

It's often worse for us, because our commands can not easily (nor willingly) give up even the mostly useless people because we're so strapped for people already.  I had a jack ass who sat on board, collecting a pay check, qualified one (topside) watch station who refused to get his fish for two years. Two years, and this jack ass created way more work for the COC than he was ever going to contribute. He eventually stopped doing even the absolute bare minimum (showing up to work on time) even though he already lived on board, and that's the only reason they finally got rid of him. Believe me, every personnel disaster you can imagine all rolled into one guy who had no intention of ever working. Our CO had a (bullshit political) policy/stance that his command would have zero unplanned losses.  That was just the absolute extreme example I had to deal with. The other half of my division was full of the kind of people you had to threaten into doing the bare minimum. Of the 40% of (9) useful people in my division, half of them were too junior to really make a difference for me and my other second class.

The Navy taught me two things...how to keep my head down and how not to be a chump.

I simply couldn't count on the majority of my shipmates, particularly the leadership.  However, I now believe that it's not the Navy's fault.  This is the important bit.

I was expecting to be surrounded by people who were better than me, and learning to live up to that standard. Instead, I'm disappointed.    This is almost word for word what I said to my supervisor at a major IT vendor right before I quit and left that industry for good.  They couldn't, or wouldn't, live up to the same standard that I was expected to live up to.  Moreover, I wanted to live up to that standard and was actively prevented from doing so.  Now here's the only problem I have with your rant:   Few have the balls or sense to challenge or even question stupid orders.   I hear where your coming from, but orders are orders.  It's on the people issuing those orders to act with integrity and most do not.  However, it's not anyone's place to challenge those orders....if that breaks down, things would be a lot worse than they already are.  But you're right, the people issuing those orders often don't have integrity or sense.  Thus the saying, ""there are no bad teams/crews/whatever, only bad leaders.""  TL;DR  You're right, but it's a societal problem.  The navy component is just one symptom of a larger problem.  Best you can do is stay low and stay strong, shipmate."

I watched CTTC gundeck his checks, got threatened by a CWO2 to keep quiet, and I did.  I made E-6 in a little over 4 years, and was set to convert to CTN. Problem was, I hated my job, and I couldn't shake the feeling that there should be something more to life than just busting your ass in a thankless job.  So I put in my papers. They said I was stupid to get out, but it was honestly one of the best decisions I made.   You are not defined by your job. If you don't like your job, get a plan, save some money, and get out.

Your dependents will be approved for ERD and be sent either back to your HoR or somewhere they can receive the proper treatment.  PERS should not take that long to make a decision. I'd say give it a week and then contact the right office (421? You can look it up on the pers website) and get confirmation of a receipt, and a POC to bother.  This same office should be able to give you more information on if you can cut your PRD short. This will depend on when your PRD is, the manning levels at your current command, and the detailer. ERD and cutting your PRD short to move with your family are two different things.  Applying for ERD is just for accounting data to move your family before you get your actual orders cut. The reason for this is outlined in the MILPERSMAN but one of them is EFM, like in your case. Getting your PRD shifted and moving with your family is up to your detailer and PERS.  My advice is wait a week, contact the correct PERS office, get a POC and find out what the next step is to get your PRD changed so you can move with your family.  Hope this helps let me know if you have any other questions."

Wars for territory aren't really going to happen because the economics of don't support them. Future dominance will be economic and information centric.

People in positions of power sure as hell aren't logical, you can look at your local chain of command for evidence of that one. =P  Soviet Union does not equal China, and as for what's to gain? Why, all the marbles.

Call it, tell them the situation.   Ask the airline to give you a notification that they caused you to miss your flight. Explain you're active duty on orders and can they please help you. If the agent can't help you, ask to speak to a supervisor. Be insistent. They do this all the time for military members. Show it when you check in to your c-school--but likely they will not ask.   Worst case scenario you'll class up a little later and graduate a little later and check into your final duty station a little later.  ninja edit: if you want to PM me your school I can find the number for you if you can't locate it."

Fill your lungs with air and you will float.  Relax.  Gentle movements, like pushing on clouds, just with a teeny bit more force since it's liquid water not water vapor.  Be calm in the water, keep your chest slightly swelled out to puff your lungs up with air and the water will caress you and let you glide along.  Gentle S-shaped motions with your hands gather water under your palms and keep you easily on the surface.  I can't emphasize this enough.  You can't muscle your way into swimming - even Olympic sprinters in the 100m are using precise strokes that work equally as well at a relaxed, calm pace - they just use well-developed muscles to do it really fast.  /former highschool/early college USA swimmer"

navy,36eylz,Blinxs209,1 point,Mon May 18 22:44:53 2015 UTC,I used to handle this process a lot. It depends on the situation and how you got injured and put on LLD.   Is it diagnosed PTSD and the others or is it Depression and Anxiety triggered from Post Traumatic Stress?   You probably won't be med retired. It is difficult to get that type of discharge unless you have a serious service related disability. I.e your legs were blown off.   More that likely you will be MEDSEP within a few months if the Doctor determines you're no longer fit for full duty. It can come really quick so get your finances in order and paperwork because that will discharge you and put you in the hands of the VA (you do get 180 days continued care from your discharge date though).   If your LIMDU period is for the next 18 months they will more than likely MEDSEP you instead of holding you til your EAOS.   Let me know how I can help and what questions you got.   My best advice will be prepared to be seperated from Service. I have seen a lot of it happen and it leaves the sailor unprepared and not ready since all of a sudden they are losing their income.

It's great to be able to fuck around a bit more than other people when it comes to gun shoots and such. Totally worth the price of admission until it comes to cleaning up afterward.   It's the second oldest rate and there's a great deal of pride within the community. I've had more good times than bad and there's a decent amount of diversity to the available billets. You can't go everywhere, but you still have a lot of options.   GM Cons: Most of the time during the ""fun stuff"" like gun shoots you're stuck working. Everybody thinks we get more trigger time than anyone else, but that's mostly not true. There are opportunities to do that, but at the end of a long day you'd much rather just pack up and leave, because there's a lot of work to be done afterwards.

You could be on a ship, or in a squadron, or at a CSD in Buenos Aires, or working with SPECWAR; it's one of the true ratings where you can 'go anywhere in the world.'  You get to help people solve problems, and feel good when you save them money or find backpay they are entitled to.  You also get to know everyone at the command, and have the hook-up anywhere you go.  CONS: There is a lot of filing work and paper-pushing.  The financial regulations are really tough and most sailors don't understand them; so you have a hard time explaining why people are/aren't entitled to things.  Nobody knows anything; but you can be damn sure they'll take that-one-guy in their divisions word over entitlements over yours.  Also you can expect to stay late a lot, as you can't get any backlogged work done during regular customer service hours, so you have to stay late to finish your backlog (and nobody who isn't a PS will understand that, they'll all give you shit for 'closing at 1600 and going home'  All-in-all not a bad rate.  Certainly not for me (I know now) but there are a lot of people who like it."
navy,36ap1g,tuvnmcx,4,Tue May 19 20:55:49 2015 UTC,"Why CTN is bad: There are a number of people in the rate who don't want to be here. They hear about advancements, and bonuses, and getting great jobs after they get out, but they have very little interest in the actual work. They want to be fleet sailors and see the world, and we don't typically offer that experience. Unfortunately, there are also people who don't want to be fleet sailors and also don't care about the actual work. They're basically just wasting billets. And even more unfortunate are the ones who waste billets but also want to stay in for 20, meaning they don't contribute anything but are also eventually promoted to leadership positions -- sadly I think you'll encounter this type of person in any rate you choose."
navy,36ap1g,nierlisse,5,Tue May 19 21:19:48 2015 UTC,"CTI: Cons; Stuck in one of a handful of duty stations forever. Language school is 7 hours of class a day followed by hours of hw at night for 6 months up to 1.5 years, depending on language.  Very small community and plenty of socially awkward people. DLI is called the desperate love institute for a reason. 6 year contract means you watch all your bootcamp friends get out after 4 and you shrivel up and die inside.  Pros; 6 weeks off work once a year to go to mandatory language class can be nice unless your CoC sucks and makes you come in anyway for GMTs and random shit. Knowing another language is pretty cool.

navy,36ap1g,Snake_DiQskin,4,Mon May 18 01:40:36 2015 UTC,"IT PROS: Advancement is usually pretty good. CWAY is very rarely an issue. Billets are available just about anywhere you might want to be stationed. It's an easy way to get certifications that you can carry with you to the civilian sector. Your JST, especially once you get up to IT2 and IT1, will get you a fair amount of the way to a Bachelor's in Computer Science. It's nice being in an air-conditioned space when you're in the middle of the Gulf. If you're into getting hookups, controlling everyone's access to internet and email can be a good way to get signatures for things like warfare pins and other PQSs. Not a lot of manual labor.  IT CONS: Too many of the people who are really competent at their job end up getting out and getting jobs in the civilian sector, so a lot of the senior ITs are awful as SMEs and even worse as leaders. Advancement rates make it a very top-heavy rate, so I've seen IT1s doing the work that would normally be delegated to a PO3 in other rates. The work you do is generally unappreciated by most everyone else in the fleet, including the brass. There are stupidly bitter rivalries between ADP ITs and Radio ITs, or at least there have been on all the ships I've been aboard. Wanting to be an expert in both ADP and Radio is tricky, since there's so much to know about each side. You can be assigned to just about any craphole the Navy wants you to go to. The IT knowledge base isn't as in-depth as that of CTNs, and CTNs will not let you forget it. The work, beyond the big stuff like keeping servers and circuits up and running, generally doesn't produce much of a sense of tangible results."
navy,36ap1g,Curtis_Low,5,Mon May 18 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"ET (Nuke)  Pros: Advancement is insane (especially if you go subs). Even for surface ETs, staying away from mast and writing your name on the test a couple times is all it takes to make the 2nd-1st jump. Also, while on watch underway, you literally hold the ship in your hands; you can turn a billion-dollar warship into the world's most useless landing strip (or worse) in a couple of seconds. Being entrusted with that much responsibility, especially as a blueshirt, is pretty cool. Also, you're probably one of the only people on the ship who actually looks forward to drills, because it means you get to go nuts, and drive the ship like you stole it (as long as the throttlemen aren't gun-shy).  Cons: The advancement is the way it is for a reason; the job starts off brutal, and just keeps getting worse the more you advance. Also, the advancement insanity goes both ways; making the 3rd-2nd jump is actually a lot worse than most rates unless you re-enlist, because 90% of the 2nd class billets get taken up by people who re-enlist 3 months after reporting on board. You will also work waaaaay more than any non-nuke on the ship; you stand twice as much duty, and your underways start several days earlier and end about half a day later than everyone else's. And if you thought NKO GMT was bad, now tack on an extra couple of hours per week of death-by-powerpoint, and a long-answer format test over all of that training at the end of each month."

I just detached from a DDG, where I owned all of the networks onboard, so it's one of those things where if something doesn't work, chances are it's going to impact a significant portion of the ship and their abilities to do their jobs. Once in a blue moon, I would get a genuine ""'Atta boy,"" but it does take its toll when you're bailing out everybody and their cousin to enable them to do their job.  So that's part of the other side of it, I guess."

navy,36ap1g,This_Is_A_Porkrind,18,Tue May 19 04:22:10 2015 UTC,"old email i get from time to time:  All Rates in the Navy work for ""The Fire Controlman"".  The Navy's primary mission is to maintain military presence and carry out operations across the globe... In order to do that we blow stuff up. The FC is the key to this mission.   Everything in the Navy is subject to change. Including rates being merged, removed and eaten by dust bunnies. These are just examples of why other rates work for the FC.  Air Rates.  All air rates in the Navy in one way or another assist in putting ""Friendly” Aircraft (AKA Targets) in the air. This tends to lure “Hostile” aircraft out. Which then FC’s will have to blow them up.  AG  They go to www.weather.com and see what tomorrows weather will be like. They give their weather presentation during briefs to soothe the Officers. Real sailors never go outside or give a crap about the weather. We're too busy fixing and operating equipment that blows stuff up. FC's do care about ducting but not about the actual weather.  BM  They train, direct, and supervise others in marlinespike, deck and boat seamanship; they paint to make the ship look nice. That way when they take pictures after the FC's blow stuff up it looks good. Then FC's get more ribbons. BM's also help FC's get on liberty faster by doing all the work we don't like. BM's Work for the FC's.  CT  control the flow of messages and information. They sit in a secret room and do strange things that no one knows about. Sooner or later the information they collect is used to blow stuff up. So there for they work for the FC's.  DC  Perform the work necessary for damage control. They repair damage control equipment and systems. So if by some means we take an incoming missile, the FC's can continue to blow stuff up.  DT  Dentist/assistants. They keep FC's teeth happy. That way the FC's are happy and don't blow stuff up when they aren't suppose too. Clean strong teeth are good for biting. If you touch an FC's console/equipment or food you will get bit.  EM  The operation and repair of the ship's electrical power plant and electrical equipment. They give FC's power so they can blow stuff up.  ET  Responsible for a bunch of electronic equipment; communications, cheap radar. They take care of that easy electronics so the FC's don't have too. That way the FC's have more time to blow stuff up. ET's should also take a sanity test. During Techcore they had a chance to become an FC. Not everyone can be a master of lethality and bring destruction to our enemies. Its just in a ET's nature to be a big baby and not want to destroy things.  CTT  Operate and maintain electronic equipment used in navigation, target detection and location, and the prevention of spying by enemies. They can determine friend or foe by looking at emissions. If they think it is a bad guy we blow it up. EW’s are also good for bringing FC’s snacks. The CTT is the guy who sleeps in combat just a tad less than a OS.  FC  Maintain and operate weapon systems used on combat ships. Complex electronics are used to ensure correct missile guidance and other such ordnance. This equipment includes as such; Radar, computers, weapons-direction equipment, target-designation systems and range finders. FC's represent the technical and tactical Weappn System experts in the Navy. Warships are made to go to war, and FC's are made to fight wars.  FC (AEGIS) FC's that are in the AEGIS weapon system. They should be considered something different from other FC's. AEGIS is split into elements. Examples such as; SPY, Computer, FCS/ORTS and Display. SPY Techs work on the SPY Radar, the main (and only) Search and Track Fire Control radar for the AEGIS weapon system. Computer Tech's sleep in most of the day. Once in a while they change a tape or answer a phone. FCS/ORTS Techs sleep all day as well, but the sit on the Missile System Supervisor Console and get to push the pretty buttons. Display, they fix consoles and everything else related to AEGIS. Or they do work the computer techs should be doing. There are many different types of FC's. The main purpose of them all is to BLOW STUFF UP!!! Or help in the process in doing so. Without FC's Navy ships would be used as tug boats or crappy cruise liners.  FT They are FC's underwater. They are our distant cousins and they blow stuff up too!  GM  Maintain and repair gunnery systems. Some times even missile-launching systems. They clean them and paint them up all nice and pretty. When the FC's blow stuff up, the GM's stuff gets dirty. They also load the ordnance on the ship. That way FC's can blow stuff up. They are a form of FC that went horribly wrong early on in the process a million years ago when we were all monkeys. Due to their inbreeding they can't blow stuff up. They enjoy throwing poop, wrestling, and smashing each others heads into FC equipment so FC's have faults to fix. GM's are however evolving and all FC's should maintain a watchful eye on them. Soon they may have 4 arms and several sets of eyes. Which will be used to aim and throw poop better.  GS  Operate, repair, and maintain main propulsion machinery. They are the stinky guys who make sure the ship can move. It sure is hot down in the engineering spaces. About 50 degrees hotter than nice Air Conditioned FC spaces. They ensure the ship gets the FC’s where they need to go to blow stuff up.  HM  They keep FC's healthy and ""happy"". They give us cool drugs to make us crazy. Their cure for all you pains and sickness is ""Motrin"". ""Motrin"" makes FC's angry, so we blow stuff up.  HT  Responsible for maintaining ship's hulls, fittings, piping systems, and machinery. They are plumbers. They also get to weld some times. They fix the toilets so the FC's can poop. FC's enjoy reading in the crapper about blowing stuff up.  IC  Operate and repair devices used in ship's interior communicates systems. They fix phones so the FC's can talk. They also run SITE TV, and stuff like that. So FC's can watch TV. The main thing they do is keep the gyro running, which is very important. That way FC's can blow stuff up.  IS  Get secret military information. Gather Intel to assist in the destruction of the evil doers. The information they provide will help FC’s blow things up.  MA Help keep law and order on the ship. That way the FC's don't have to kill everyone aboard. MA’s make FC's happy by letting FC's get away with stuff like ""Training Videos"". FC's like to watch them. That makes them happy. Then they go blow stuff up.  CS  They cook food and feed FC's. FC's like MS's because FC's are really hungry after blowing stuff up. Next time you see an MS tell them FC's love them. Their food gives us gas so in combat FC's will always win in a farting contest. Other rates cannot properly digest food that MS's make. Its referred as ""Death from Within"". It could be considered a weapon or cruel punishment in some Countries. Send them our cooks and they shall surely die. (Recently changed to CS, Culinary Specialist.)  MM  Operate and maintain a bunch of stuff for ship propulsion and auxiliary machinery. Aux equipment like elevators, refrigeration plants, air conditioning systems and desalinization plants. They are in the Engineering department. So like most if not all engineers, they keep the ship moving and operating so FC's can go BLOW stuff up.  MR  Skilled machine-tool operators. They make replacement parts for various types of equipment. They some times give or make FC’s parts to help them fix their gear. For example bolts, nuts and gaskets. Some MR’s work on the VCHT system as well. (See HT)  NC ( Try to get FC's to reenlist, with promises of nice SRB and the endless quest to blow stuff up.  OS  Pretend to operate radar’s, navigation and communications equipment. They pretty much clean Combat Information Center and get FC's a coke to drink. They operate a consoles and talk on Red phones. They also are expertly skilled at writing backwards. OS's brake FC's stuff (consoles) so we get mad and blow stuff up. Hey TIC correlate my middle finger in front of your face. OS's love to induce Operator Error Faults into any piece of equipment they touch.  PS  Bug FC's about personal requirements rights and benefits. They also keep records up to date. That way when a FC gets an award it goes into his Service record. That makes FC's happy so they go blow stuff up and get paid.   QM  Steer the ship and skillfully navigate the ship. That way FC's are closer to the stuff they blow up so they can take pictures.  IT  They use to be RM's (Radioman) Operate communications. Like E-mail and load crypto as well. That way FC's can write home about stuff they blew up. Plus the ship can talk to other ships about stuff the FC's blew up. That way the FC's feel good.  SH  Manage barber shops, ships store etc. That way FC's can have candy that the OS's, ET's, ST's and GM's buy them. The FC's can also get a haircut and look sharp for the pictures after blowing stuff up.  LS  Supply clerks. They order stuff for the ship. That way the FC's can have new parts for the equipment. Or a new shirt and some pants. LS's get us stuff and our mail so we can blow stuff up.  ST  Look for things long and hard full of seaman. ST's try to find subs. Its like finding a flash light in a bathtub using your ear. But usually the FC's find subs when their periscope pops up from the water. Then the FC's blow the sub up. ST's focus on Underwater Warfare so we can focus on the real warfare areas like Air, Surface and Strike warfare.  YN  Secretarial work and clerical work. They write things into FC's records so the FC's can blow stuff up. YN's do a lot of paper work. So they are ""busy"" and can never help FC's. So FC's get mad and blow stuff up. YN's like many other rates have working hours. Please come back tomorrow at 0800.  This is of course all in good fun. All the rates in the navy are important pieces in the complex puzzle that makes a successful command."

CONS: We aren't CTNs, and a lot of what we do is dumbed down or left to civilians. I wish I was a CTN, but that's because I have a thirst for knowledge and would rather be in security.

navy,36ap1g,PawnKiller,1 point,Mon May 18 04:43:11 2015 UTC,"CTN  PROS: the training doesnt get any better than this rate; if you are looking to start a career in computer science but you want to stay in the navy for a bit longer, you cant do better (sorry ITs, CTN work way outscales IT for everything but being a sysadmin).  You will come out with at least a BS worth of knowledge in CS, probably pickup a programming language or two, and have lots of civilian certifications to put on a resume.  If you are interested in UNIQUE billet opportunities, here ya go...SPECWAR, DEVGRU, JCIE, TIO...etc, lots of plain clothes special duty that makes this job never really lose it's edge and stays entertaining.  If you dont like going to sea: you have to volunteer as a CTN, otherwise you'll never see a boat.  All of the billets for CTN's, you will likely be one of maybe 3-400 navy personnel, since we dont typically get assigned to major Navy hubs.  If you want to be a kick ass elite hacker of epic proportion....ask about RIOT school and the ION program.  Oh did I mention 5.0 reenlistment bonuses?  Yeah 74k went a long way to buying my first house :)  CONS: The schools are hard as fuck....and they are seriously unforgiving when it comes to passing them.  You make the grade or you dont.  Very limited duty stations, lots of potential to end up at a command you wont like, and you'll be stuck there.  Three year tours, which means by the time you are full up and ready to do your job, you will have about a year and some change left before you rotate again.  Eval padding is also a rampant problem, if you end up at one of the three major CTN hubs, you will likely find its more akin to the girlscouts than the Navy (volunteer hours outweighing actual work, since we cant put anything about our jobs on the evals themselves since job is a higher classification than evals are written to)."
navy,36ap1g,TMF4200,6,Mon May 18 15:26:12 2015 UTC,Man CTNs love to exaggerate. You won't even get close to a bachelors in knowledge. The only thing close to comparable to a full degree would be the nuclear program.

navy,36ap1g,I_jus_lurk_here,-1,Sun Jun 14 16:21:20 2015 UTC,"Taking 4 years in the navy as a compared to a full time student, you arent getting even close to a bachelors worth of knowledge."
navy,36ap1g,CTNope,-2,Sun May 17 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"If we're talking about level 100 courses for general education, then no. As far as other training goes, it's up to the person a lot of the time, but there are a vast number of opportunities and freebie credits handed out. I'm only a few credits away from my master's, and I know one of my co-workers (we don't usually call each other shipmate in this field) is about half way towards his."
navy,36ap1g,I_jus_lurk_here,-1,Sun May 17 23:56:06 2015 UTC,"I guess your site might be different than mine.  We have a UMUC rep here and she has print-offs for each of the pipelines (ie, analyst, operator, dev, etc) and shows what UMUC will accept.  Our 'upper level' courses offered through the agency are taught by civilian instructors and are often associated with civilian level education.    An example being, my undergrad degree is in Comp Sci w/ an Investigational Forensics minor, UMUC offered credit towards my minor for each of the agency forensics classes I took that closely meshed with the curriculum they offered (aside from the SANS cert classes).  I was also given credit for the upper level data structures class I took through the agency.  UMUC is certified by the agency for education, so someone sat down and determined both ways what they would accept for credit and most of the classes at that level are taught by folks qualified as adjuncts through UMUC itself.  However, like you said, most of the time signing up for these classes is up to the person and only the bare bones is absolutely required to be completed, after that they sort of forget about the rest.  I was lucky and was assigned to a small team with a marginal workflow, so I was allotted quite a bit of time to devote to training and education.  Being the shop developer (I write some of the tools we use for automation of tasks) also scored me two programming bootcamps and trips to MD for developer schools.  In a perfect world, no, JCAC and OJT would not get you a degree.   I am fully aware that you only get a glimpse of some of the topics that you could see in a brick and mortar, and personally feel that the math portion needed to be stressed a lot harder.  Then again, it really comes down to comparing school for school because between the three in my house who all went to different schools, for the same degree, the math requirements were different for each of us.  I feel like traditional schooling is still better in this field (having done both)...but all I'm saying here is that you CAN get a degree with relative ease based purely on the training that is given to you and a little extra effort on your part."
navy,36ap1g,IAnswerYourDumbShit,0,Mon May 18 00:07:35 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, and it's probably easier than any other rate since we will always have internet access in some capacity."
navy,36ap1g,I_jus_lurk_here,-4,Mon May 25 05:45:41 2015 UTC,"Well I cant speak for EVERY CTN because each command is different..however, at the point I am at in my tour, UMUC gave me 64 credit towards a degree, and if I was further along in my <govt agency here> training pipeline, I could have gotten up to 90.  So when I say you CAN get a BS worth of knowledge...I am being quite literal.  I am not speaking directly to JCAC alone.   Like I said, not all sites are the same, but the one I am at stresses training above all.  I have spent at least 8 months total time at civilian proctored schools, certification training's, etc.  I now have my master's degree and can say that I was at least adequately prepared with the small amount of outside training I had to do to finish my undergrad degree."
navy,36ap1g,looktowindward,4,Mon May 25 06:01:48 2015 UTC,"See and that's why, because its UMUC. Any average state school wouldn't give diddily dick for a cs degree, maybe an IT or cyber sec.  Most schools have a max of 20-30 credits for non traditional sources.   Someone already pointed out that you don't learn the core classes of a CS degree."
navy,36ap1g,opaquely_clear,0,Mon May 18 02:24:19 2015 UTC,"Well, that's your opinion, and that's totally fine.  Georgia Tech had no problem accepting my undergrad from UMUC as entry into their graduate program.  My two roomates both went to brick and mortar state school and aside from some of the lab experience, I would say we received a fairly similar education.  I see that pretty little IT flair you have going there, so I can only assume you don't have any first hand knowledge.  Haters gon hate."
navy,36ap1g,looktowindward,2,Mon May 18 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"GA Tech, one of the top CS programs in the country, accepted your UMUC online degree for their master's program? Really? And you got accepted?  I'm skeptical. Tell me which other MS programs you got into. CMU?"

Is there linear algebra, complex/modern algebra, set theory? How far into discrete math do you go? What about algorithm design? Data structures? Compiler construction? Assembly language programming? Machine learning? Complexity theory?   Are you actually building your own stuff or is it more just running what someone else builds?"

navy,36ap1g,ChuckFinleyFL,1 point,Mon May 18 00:37:38 2015 UTC,"No.  I work for a very large company that does Internet stuff.  Although I'm an engineer,  I work with many CS grads from top programs - Stanford, MIT, CMU, GA Tech,  etc.  My MS (acquired post Navy) is computer engineering. I'm readable in two languages.  I'm a competent coder and a very competent network engineer.  My primary focus is something else,  though.   All of that being said - the level of CS skill (theoretical,  computational, etc) is far beyond what a CT learns. These guys have written 50k lines of code.  They can write device drivers from scratch. CT training can teach you to be a reasonable security admin.  Some CTs become reasonable hackers and sysadmins. Some become ok network engineers,  but I've never met one who really understood the theory - unless you're conversant in graph theory and deterministic methods?   But I don't see the level of skill that you would need to get hired as a SWE.  Might some guys pick it up?  Maybe. But the idea that this is standard isn't serious.   Agencies have lower standards because they demand your TS clearance."
navy,36ap1g,I_jus_lurk_here,-1,Mon May 18 07:00:46 2015 UTC,"I answered a good portion of that in another comment, however, Ill expand a little.  The initial training you get as a CTN won't provide an in-depth scope into most of those topics.  That training is more to expose people with ZERO compsci/netsec experience to the different aspects of the jobs you could potentially be doing.  You really only spend 2-3 weeks on any given topic with additional 'modules' later on expanding on or using that knowledge.  The required math is taught up front and is kind of being used to weed people out.  But, again, the discrete math topic is a 'drink from a fire hose' and isn't completely comprehensive.  That being said, depending on what you end up doing you will be provided with additional training directly applicable to what your job will be.    If you end up going the implant/developer track you will definitely hit all the wickets you just described, however, if you do something more along the lines of a general analyst, you wont be exposed to those types of things.  I, personally, am working in the forensics and analytic development teams so I have had the opportunity to dig into those topics and hit schools for a few different programming languages plus some expanded fundamental computer science topics.  So...yes and no...and...it depends.  As shitty of an answer as that is.  I would like to briefly state that if you end up going the full developer track or the ION track you WILL get damn near a full comp sci degree worth of training by the time you are done with your first tour...probably before.  This isn't anecdotal evidence, as I stated in another comment, this is a literal assessment given by UMUC.  Although it's an online school, it is respected enough within the community as having a good curriculum."

navy,36bxl4,catartiste,4,Mon May 18 03:35:09 2015 UTC,Sea pay is only payable when assigned to a vessel.  You're going to a squadron which is coded as sea duty because it deploys and would take you away from your home/family.  This comes into play on your follow-on assignment where you'll go to a shore-unit that does not deploy.  Type-2 Sea Duty:  Sea  duty  (SSC  2)  is  duty  performed  in commissioned  vessels  or  at  activities  in  an  active  status home-ported/home-based in CONUS that operate away from their home port or home base in excess of 150 days per  year.

It's more of a self defense than anything so you can spin it better, just don't go carrying it into the barracks, or hide that sucker. Bircher's idea of a knife is also good, but again, not in the barracks, and take a look at the state and local laws about blade length. Rocking something like a KABAR can be hard to justify, though I used to have their lil Warthog that I carried around in my pocket.  Granted, I didn't feel safe at all in Chicago area and took great means to protect myself and others, but I really really don't recommend doing what I did as it would have been my ass in a sling if I got found out.  If you're really worried, go buy a nice heavy solid wood rolling pin. It's not very portable, but it's not illegal to carry around a rolling pin with you, same with if it gets found in your barracks room.

navy,366gha,jpstudly,8,Mon May 18 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"Was stationed in Atsugi for just over 3 years. Depending on what ship/squadron you're attached to you will either have lots of time in Japan or lots of time out to sea but in many different countries every couple of months.   My biggest piece of advice, if you drink, control yourself. Don't be the asshole that goes out and gets unreasonable drunk only to get in trouble later. Find a good group of people to go out with and enjoy yourself but monitor each other.   Make sure you don't spend 3 years touring the insides of all the bars in Asia, you will have missed all of the other great sights and you will regret it.   Climb Fuji and get the cool walking stick stamped at every stop, it will be nice to look at it years later and remember you're time there.   Get off base! So many young guys get over there and turn into base hermits. Get off base and explore, just get on the train and get off at random stops and emerse yourself in the culture.   Use the trains. Japan has one of the best public transportation systems in the entire world. It's super cheap and extremely efficient.   The biggest bar district is Roppungi, spelling?, it can be really fun, but dont live there like a lot of guys do.   Biggest thing, enjoy yourself and make the most of it. And get your mind off home, flying back every year might be tempting, but the flight is super long and it sucks.   Best of luck to you."

I sometimes wish that I took more leave to just explore the country more though. I was able to take my holiday leave to Kyoto and the surrounding area, so that was fun.    Traveling around Japan is very easy once you get a phone and use google maps to orient yourself on which direction you want to go. Hyperdia.com was very useful when you wanted to plan out your trip by train.     Just start saving now. Make a deposit every two weeks to your savings account. And soon, once you've assimilated with your command, division and surroundings, take some time and just explore. Start small, go to Yokohama. There's this Brazilian restaurant down in Chinatown (which would be $50 a head) where you can go with some new friends and just freaking eat all of the meats and grilled pineapple you want. Or go to the Robot Restaurant in Shinjuku to check out some crazy Japanese show with Robots, lazers and women."
navy,366gha,TydniC,6,Sat May 16 23:56:09 2015 UTC,"I really do not get why the hell everybody here is bitching about plane ticket prices. Yes, they're expensive (1400 a pop, thereabouts, to go on leave), but if you stop spending all your frigging COLA on Chu-His and save your money like a responsible person (it's really not that hard), it gets a lot easier because you're not living paycheck to paycheck. Anyhow. I loved Japan; just don't act like a stereotypical chest thumping asshole (there really are a lot of those), and definitely get out of Yokosuka. There's a lot to do there. As for leave; depending on which ship you're on, you may or may not be able to take leave as often as you might like (most people took a chunk of leave once a year).

Get off base: go on MWR trips, book a trip with the base IACE office, make it a point to attend at least one fertility festival, see a show at Shinjuku's robot restaurant, go north, go south, camp in Nikko, and definitely visit the big Buddha in Kamakura. Buy yourself a descent digital camera and make yourself a digital photo album highlighting your trips before you leave Japan. Living in Japan is whatever you make of it.

Leave taking sucks. I used all my leave to either chill out or travel Japan. Almost no point going back to the US. Especially since if you've been in Japan long enough, you WILL get culture shock going back to the USA.  That being said, Japan is amazing and this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for many.

I had the opposite problem underway, I'd lose weight (I was once 135 lbs during one particularly awesome patrol) because I only normally had time to eat twice a day. But damned if I didn't get charged for all 3."

""First, I would like to commend Firemen Timmy for having a very excellent shine on his shoes. His uniform was smart and he kept his assigned area--the drink bar--spotless! Great attention to detail!   The salad bar was delightful. My favorite dressing, Ranch, was out, and also, to my great surprise, hard boiled eggs! Thank you. The lettuce was brown and wilty when I went back for seconds, but that's to be expected, I suppose.   I was sorely aggrieved that we were out of milk. I dislike drinking sugary drinks with lunch, so I made do with water. A trial, to be sure, as water is all I drink on watch. I desperately look forward to my milk at lunch.   My mother says if you have nothing nice to say, you ought to not say it, but I feel the state of that poor lunch needs addressed. The rice was burnt and crunchy. The chicken was dry and overly salted. I doused it with ranch-again, my thanks for restocking my salad dressing after the last meal eval. The okra was a downright disaster--it was slimy, brown, and congealed in a cold lump of grease on my plate. However, the carrots were on point! I would like to thank CS2 Schmuckatelli for those carrots. They had a hint of honey and the perfect amount of butter. I was skeptical when I read the placard that said ""sweet carrots,"" but I went back for seconds.   Also, BRAVO ZULU to our night baker!! Those sour dough rolls were amazing. It rounded out my lunch perfectly.   Thank you for your time and attention in reading my meal eval.   Very respectfully,  HT1 TheBeneGesseritWitch""  EDIT: Yes, I write small and I use the back of the sheet. I always single out an FSA who has been working hard because that life sucks. And I've gotten icecream served at the dinner meals, extra toppings to the salad bar, ""cordon blue balls"" to replace the cordon blue hot pocket things (mainly because saying Blue Balls made my shop laugh), and strawberry jelly in addition to grape for the fast line, crackers and fruit left out during non meal hours, flavoured syrups (blueberry and strawberry FTW!) and others....my meal evals are serious business."

That, along with the painkillers, made for a few good days of boot camp (not that anyway were bad). It was surreal seeing advertisements and stuff in the confines of sterile military training.  Only chance you have of catching the playoffs are if your RDC is a fan of the team playing on a day that he's stuck on duty (OOD, CDO, etc) AND he's feeling particularly saucy. I'm not sure the technology is there to broadcast it to the division. There is a pull down projector but I don't think it's connected to cable or network TV. Just the intranet, and maybe a desktop.   After some time you'll be able to crack an occasional joke with the RDCs. I saw a dude get skipped on an inspection purely on his ability to talk Eagles football.

I got some advanced certifications in boat handling and tactics and just had a blast driving a fast patrol boat around beautiful locations like Guam and GTMO.   There are other opportunities, the law enforcement on base is a fun gig, it's not exactly like being a civilian cop. Service members generally follow the orders of an MA so you'll only rarely actually have to fight someone. But crime does exist on base, I've made arrests for everything from DUI to Rape. It's some decent experience of you want to transition to civilian LE, just remember the civilian LE is a lot dirtier and more dangerous. There aren't a lot of third strike felons or crazy violent methheads on base.    If law enforcement isn't your style, then fleet protection offers some cool jobs. There are units that draw heavily from the MA rate in order to protect ships and other assets in foreign ports. These guys train heavily in small craft operations, access control and small unit tactics. When a ship has to visit a less than friendly port they deploy both on the ship, and in boats around it to prevent another incident like the USS Cole. A pretty cool job.   Navy dog handlers are almost exclusively MAs, it's a pretty cool job. Many act as K-9 units for base police, but others deploy to combat zones to help look for IEDs. More than one MA has become a combat causality in this role so it's not something to take lightly.   There are other paths you can take that I'm less familiar with, protective details (basically bodyguarding Navy VIPs), investigations, and such forth.   MA is a pretty sweet rating, enjoy the ride, I know I did.   And don't forget to salute the blue stickers at the gate, the officer's wives can be snotty about it. : /"

navy,363f8r,vonIsar,1 point,Fri May 15 22:12:43 2015 UTC,9 months from now :( but at least I finally got a rate!!!
navy,363f8r,happybadger,2,Sat May 16 06:31:56 2015 UTC,Automatic third class when you graduate. Can't drink in a school. Muster every night at 2045 sunday through thursday. Live at the gateway instead of barracks. Double tap on a test and more than likely be dis enrolled from the school. Duty section every 4th day but never on watch. You'll be duty section leadership. Some hard ass instructors some pretty good ones. Anything else just pm me
navy,363f8r,Geoffhahaha,2,Fri May 15 23:31:29 2015 UTC,"Automatic third class when you graduate.    I love how it seems like every other rate has this or some close variation of it, but there are E-3 corpsmen with four years on the books and our average pick-up time is 3.3 years. I'm mad, bro."
navy,363f8r,vonrus1,2,Sat May 16 00:46:08 2015 UTC,Fuck. I'm was a 2.5 year E5.
navy,363f8r,vonrus1,3,Sat May 16 01:28:09 2015 UTC,"I know a six year HM1, but apart from that unless you have a really technical subclassification or are so Joe Navy that you nauseate everyone around you, you're looking at upwards of five advancement tests to even consider becoming an HM3. I don't think it's even mathematically possible on the first couple.   That being said, with the right classification you exit with a six figure job and we have some of the easiest commissioning routes. It's just a terrible rate if you intend to go anywhere in the enlisted ranks without wearing knee pads and lipstick."

navy,363f8r,USNthrowawa,4,Sat May 16 03:27:27 2015 UTC,"Advancement ain't shit. HM is a great rate because you can do more or less anything with it. Want to do the run-and-gun shit? The FMF loves you. Want to do super moto run-and-gun? We have special forces pipelines that have you jumping out of planes and criking people in the dark. Want to play doctor? IDC puts you directly under a medical officer and gives you a huge scope of practice. Want to be a technician? We've got medical ones (lab, radiology, nuclear, etc) and electronic ones (biomed, big money outside). Desk work? We've got it. Nursing? We've got it. Logistics? We're stuck with it. You can work on a ship, in a helicopter, in the infantry, in shock trauma camps, with a base, or in a hospital with all subfields of medicine represented in some way. Medical officers push you toward advancement within medicine, other corpsmen let you experiment on them, and when you get out you've got a wealth of experience and/or certifications that transfers well to a civilian career.   You're joining the most decorated rate in the Navy under some of the nicest leadership with great options both in and out of service. The Hospital Corps has its share of bullshit, but if you came in wanting to be a corpsman it's a fantastic opportunity that I've never regretted a day of."
navy,363f8r,happybadger,1 point,Sat May 16 03:51:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely didn't want it. It kind of just fell into my lap which is weird because I know how popular it is. But the more I read, the more OK with it I become. MECP seems like a pretty good goal to shoot for.   Advancement would be nice...like I'd be cool with even below average, but I saw the percentages last cycle. Ouch."
navy,363f8r,psjoe96,6,Sat May 16 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"Well, if you aren't a medical guy to begin with, there are some pretty cool aspects.    You get to stab people with needles. If you don't like them, you get to stab them with bigger needles.  You get to see a lot of cool gore. One marine in my surgical ward had a 400lb box fall on their leg and had to have it amputated. Getting to see the process of the amputation and the wound itself was awesome. I put an IV in a baby's forehead once. My field medical training largely consisted of watching IED wounds and discussing how to treat complex trauma.  The hours aren't bad. In a hospital you're working maybe 7AM to 3PM. Clinics are roughly the same. Ships apparently work you to death and greenside is a bag of dicks, but you can have a genuinely easy day while other rates are working 18 hour shifts in boiler rooms. It's one of the more intelligent rates, sometimes. If you're a well-read person, there's a lot to learn and discuss within the field and a diverse crowd to do so with. It's morally complex, scientifically intricate, technologically advanced stuff and a field that's undergoing a massive renaissance.  You're in-demand. There are certain rates that you want to be friends with. Culinary specialists will give you extra food, logistics specialists will give you extra stuff, personnel specialists will push paperwork faster, but corpsmen are usually the only medical staff you have informal access to and in an operational capacity are usually the only medical staff present. You have a large amount of responsibility and get a lot of benefits with both the Navy and marines. Marines are fun. Treating marines is fun. One got a major leg surgery and then jumped out of bed on said leg to get his phone. Another put his gown on backwards and walked out in front of five female officers full-frontal. They like to touch things they shouldn't, jump off things they shouldn't, and take any dare thrown at them. Essentially it's veterinary medicine with anatomically-similar animals and you never run out of novel scenarios.  Lots of neat things to play with. Friends in a MARSOC warehouse hooked me up with a lot of high speed shit for my medbag. In the hospital I got to dick around with really complex machinery. If you're the kind of person who likes new toys, there are plenty of them in medicine. There's a lot of passion. Medicine is a really intimate thing. Sure other jobs are important, but at the end of the day if you're a radar operator you're staring at a screen and if you're a hull technician you're fixing a pipe. With medicine, you've literally got a human life in your hands. You're seeing people at one of the most vulnerable points in their life and guiding them through that. You get to brush away all the superfluous military bullshit and connect with people on a level that is extremely personal regardless of rank, age, race, creed, and all the other things which would otherwise separate you. Once people get a taste of that, a lot of us become really passionate about our craft and see it as somewhere between science, art, and religion. Working with people like that is great. It's really informal. Fraternising between enlisted and officer ranks is illegal, but medical officers are usually medical first. I've known NC officers on a first name basis. With patients, after paying due respects I've conversed with O-6s who could command an entire ship on the same level that I have with privates still in boot camp. Even the combat corpsmen have a compassionate side more often than not.  It's got a cool history. The Hospital Corps itself has been at the forefront of military medicine since its creation, but the history of medicine in general is a great read. You'll be joining a long line of scientists, philosophers, engineers, and specialists who've spent several thousand years understanding the body and how to fix it.  There are a lot of angles with which to approach medicine. I really love art, psychology, the interaction of systems, craftsmanship, and philosophy. Even with basic procedures and assessments I get to explore those things. Whatever your passions are, you can work them into your job and utilise them to help someone in a way that the guy next to you might not be able to."
navy,363f8r,vonrus1,3,Sat May 16 05:20:51 2015 UTC,"There is really nothing better than a good corpsman and nothing worse than a bad one. I've had my fair share of both in the past two years. Going through chemo, then later daily antibiotics infusions, I got pretty close to the corpsmen that stuck me every day to where I hang out with them on the weekends.   But lazy corpsmen... don't get me fucking started."
navy,363f8r,ChuckFinleyFL,2,Sat May 16 05:57:11 2015 UTC,"The shitbags infuriate me like nothing else and they'll pay dearly for it when I become their LPO. I left med school to be a corpsman and treat it extremely seriously. Slack off on Navy things all day, they're paying you something like a dollar an hour and I expect a dollar's worth of work out of you when we're away from a clinical setting, but anything that violates primum non nocere out of laziness or negligence may as well be willful assault or homicide.   The three greatest things that could happen to the rate are putting our schooling on par with nuke school, tying us to the Hippocratic Oath, and tying the Hippocratic Oath to the UCMJ. The system allows for laziness and that just doesn't work in a setting where your mistakes cause someone undue suffering."
navy,363f8r,happybadger,2,Sat May 16 06:08:37 2015 UTC,"Some good information here but also a lot of BS and fluff.   -On par with Nuke school? I would hardly equate 4 1/2 months of schooling to the 18-24 months a Nuke goes through.  -18 hour watches in boiler rooms? Where did you come up with that laughable number?  -Extra food and stuff? Not on a carrier.  I'm not going to pick apart everything you said that's false, but keep in mind a lot of young people are coming in here for accurate information, making a decision based on what they read. Any of us who have actually served owe it to them to give them the truth, so they aren't making one of the most important decisions of their lives based off misinformation."

If I have to stick a patient, each gauge is there for a reason and there isn't s lot of wiggle room to justify putting a larger one in you. However, if you're a corpsman and piss me off, it's IV practice day. You get a 27 gauge, but unfortunately it's the only one I can find so I'm sticking you with a 14g.

navy,362da9,JCY2K,2,Sun May 17 20:18:39 2015 UTC,"So much this. By the time you're sitting in a courtroom, ""make an example out of drug use"" is kind of beside the point.   Of the things they deal with on the SCM and GCM level, drug use is kind of the bottom shelf as far as severity of crimes go. More than ""oh my friend gave me a joint"" (or even ""…a line of coke"") is likely going on; usually drug cases just go NJP & ADSEP."

I'm not saying it doesn't mean something more coming from a panel of members but pretty much any time a chief is getting sentenced at a General Court-Martial, they're going to lose their anchors one way or another.

navy,365cqj,redthrax,4,Sat May 16 08:05:09 2015 UTC,"Congrats man and I'm glad you're excited! I'll try to answer your questions, but I'm not sure if it's possible for me to be more helpful than evenmorebetter.   (1) IS is pretty varied, as are most rates. It depends a lot on your NEC (C-School) and Command's mission. At the end of the day, most of the Navy's Intelligence Specialists either focus on briefing current intelligence updates or doing actual analysis through imagery / full motion video / HUMINT reporting / etc. It's a very broad field and your job can change immensely from one command to another - which to me is a positive!  (2) Dam Neck is tiny... It really doesn't even qualify to be called a base and is more accurately titled an annex of Oceana Air Base. With it's size aside, it's a cozy little base. The Virginia Beach area is a good place to be stuck for 4-8 mo's, depending on your training pipeline. You'll have plenty to do when you get your freedom back.  (3) Deployments are varied. You could be doing land side deployments (less likely now due to the current state of affairs) or sea side deployments. You could be briefing the CO on a daily basis and giving him an OPINTEL update or analyzing the full motion video feed of the ship's onboard UAV. It all varies, on some deployments you can even go about your normal task and conduct imagery analysis or strike planning.  (4) I don't know what he or she told you? There are a lot of great rates in the Navy though. AC is a pretty solid rate as well, but I hear you have a pretty high chance of getting burnt out. I've been an IS for six years now. During that time I've completed my Bachelor's Degree, worked at Tier One Commands, completed sea-side deployments, and made both E6 and received my Commission to Intelligence Officer. You'll hear it 1,000 times, but it really is what you make it. If you go in and just do your job, you'll survive, but if you then go home and pursue your education and map some goals - you'll have a lot better chance at surpassing the standard."
navy,365cqj,bc87m,2,Sat May 16 15:50:39 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty interesting. I'm really looking forward to seeing the job first hand, I know it's hard to get examples in public places so I just have to wait really.  So there's tons of sea deployments? That's good I like that. I'm assuming just about any ship needs IS so ill end up being on possibly any ship?"
navy,365cqj,bc87m,1 point,Sat May 16 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"As an IS, you are more likely to get sent out on the larger ships, primarily Amphibs and Carriers; however, there are also positions on smaller ships, like destroyers, they are just less in number and depend on the ship's mission. There are IS's that don't go to a ship at all in their first six years, but there are also those that go on multiple. It really just depends on whether you pursue an expeditionary command or more of a Fleet support command."
navy,365cqj,shamablama,1 point,Sat May 16 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"Well, Dam Neck sucks. That's all I can say here. Also, be glad you avoided AC, that was my previous rate and IS is so much better in my opinion."
navy,365cqj,PalmdaleComeBackToMe,0,Wed May 20 17:13:53 2015 UTC,"I don't want to come off sounding like a complete dick, so try to take this as constructively as possible: Work on your spelling/grammar. Resign more or less means to quit. If I was a CDR or CAPT and that mistake was on a slide you were briefing to me, I'd walk out the room. You lose credibility with improper writing and it's a distraction. If you don't know the difference between resign and re-assign, why would I take your intelligence assessment seriously? You could be the best briefer/analyst out there, but if your slide is off kilter then it's all for nothing.   Anyway, I'd rather not get into specifics about what ISs do. You're going to be an analyst. Do you like researching and thinking critically/outside the box? If so, you picked the right rate."
navy,365cqj,evenmorebetter,-4,Sun May 17 18:33:28 2015 UTC,Here's your first tip - don't go around shooting your mouth off about being an IS.   Second tip - people typically don't just get reassigned rates unless you ask for it.

navy,365cqj,evenmorebetter,1 point,Sat May 16 17:13:59 2015 UTC,"You left a comment with no value intentionally. That isn't what this subreddit is about. Additionally, the majority of your content on reddit appears to revolve around browsing and commenting on pornographic and 'gonewild' subreddits - which doesn't generally appeal to the highest caliber of people. Just my two cents, but if you are commenting just to be a prick, do it on another sub, as most of these people are only trying to gather a bit of information about their future."
navy,365cqj,bc87m,1 point,Sat May 16 18:30:29 2015 UTC,"Oh good, you replied :) now let me give my rebuttal.  First of all... since when did this subreddit become about content? I don't see any rules about adding 'value-ridden content'. If you know anything about that little icon you have by your sn then you shouldn't be telling random people you don't know that you're part of the military intel community. Why should I be telling someone I don't know information about a military base when I don't know who they really are? That's just stupid. Not only that, but it leaves them just as vulnerable to people looking to exploit dumbasses just like himself who tell random people what they do. Learn some damn opsec.  Additionally, what this subreddit IS also not about is questions for newbies who aren't even in the damn navy. The first fuckin rule to the side is to not post pre-enlistment questions in this sub.  Third... are you fucking kidding me with looking at my history and seeing that I commented on gonewild subs?? Are you that fucking childish and naive?? Do you actually think nobody else subscribed to this sub hasn't/isn't a participant in gonewild categories?? I can easily bet you that at least 95% of the other subscribers have been or is a part of a porn sub. It may be via another screen name, but just because I don't give a shit enough to create a secondary screen name so that people I don't know/don't care about see that I sub to porn subs, doesn't attribute to my moral characteristics AT ALL. If you think looking at porn makes me an immoral person, you are one of the biggest naive twats on here. That is one of the most naive and stupidest things I have heard so far.   Thank you for giving me your two cents even though it wasn't asked for and still doesn't mean shit. Now let me give you my two cents... assuming you're actually in the navy, you know just as well that military people aren't always the nicest people. I was trying to be subtle about this, but you are pretty damn dense. I've gained enough salt under my collar to not give a fuck about 'being nice' on a anonymous forum, nor that you and OP are downvoting me cause your tampons are wet and need to get changed. Get the fuck off this sub if you're going to request information about things you shouldn't, this is not the sub for that and that's not the type of information to be thrown out to random people you don't know. So please, keep commenting on me... yes, I may be a prick, but my points are valid. And yes, every comment you keep submitting may make me look like a prick (which amounts to jack shit) but you look just as stupid and naive."
navy,365cqj,evenmorebetter,2,Sat May 16 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to make any actual IS knowledge public. I was just curious what the city is like and how the schooling is, not the content of it. All stuff that would be public record.  However I don't want any respect for just being enlisted either.

navy,364qyg,AVlord559,3,Sat May 16 03:33:19 2015 UTC,You won't get all that much.  Expect for some old jokes from the fresh out of high school kids.

Yes, it's true that the funding is funneled through the USN (as the group in charge of all DON aviation) but that was a win for the USMC, not just the Navy.  Likewise the article wonders why -E/F F/A-18s would need protection from jamming in addition to the Growler, even though Super Hornets have their own radar and comms suites, the jamming of which would make them mission ineffective.  Sen. McCain adding funding for UCAS-D wasn't a ""win"" for the Navy as the Navy has been pleading to kill UCAS-D, much as the Air Force  wants to scrap A-10.  It was a good session for Navy, sure, but the Navy was also getting slashed for 10 years while the other services were expanding exponentially due to Iraq and Afghanistan."

It lists your qualifications, your leadership roles, your awards, and your education.  Now, on the cynical side of things, some people just do their jobs and they do it well. But you can't just write ""did my job and always showed up on time."" So you have to make up numbers about how many lives you've influenced, and how if you weren't there the mission would have failed horribly. And then you write it in really business sounding language so the person reading it doesn't ask you what it means because they don't want to look dumb.

navy,360wca,PM_ME_A_KNEECAP,12,Fri May 15 03:55:41 2015 UTC,"Do not fraternize.  Do not fraternize.  Do not fraternize.  Also, the worst thing that can happen if you ask someone if you can do something is them telling you no. I've seen Midshipmen stand a full watch before, drive the boat, and one even went and painted the ship with a BM. Have fun, be smart, know why you're there, and you'll be fine.  Also, try not to vomit on any officers."

navy,360wca,Doofe_N7,3,Sun Jun 21 03:13:14 2015 UTC,"USNA MIDN here. Be humble and willing to learn. Know the rules, and follow them. It's not hard to sleep through CORTRAMID and get nothing from it- don't do that. You will get exactly as much out of it as you put in.  San Diego liberty is great. I would recommend buying a month-long metro pass and using the public transit system to get anywhere you want to go. Gaslamp district is a good time if you're of age, then there's the beaches, the zoo, and Sea World, all accessible by public transportation."
navy,360wca,Poopkitty,2,Fri May 15 13:21:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate. 3/C, so not of age unfortunately. I never thought about getting a metro pass- good advice."
navy,360wca,Milhouse99,6,Fri May 15 20:27:04 2015 UTC,Just don't call it the metro. ;) It's the trolley.
navy,360wca,inocomprendo,3,Fri May 15 20:54:38 2015 UTC,"MIDN 1/C here.   Make friends with your peers who seem mature and like they have their shit together. It's a small military and you're going to be seeing these same people for years to come. Your CORTRAMID group is going to be like 1/3 of your year group. Commissioning can seem like a long way off right now but right now is when you start developing your professional reputation. I still remember people who skylined themselves as lazy or unreliable during CORTRAMID and Mountain Warfare Training. This is probably a no-brainer but do not show up and fail the initial PRT. This got a lot of people sent home my year. All you have to do is pass but it would also seriously benefit you to be in as good of shape as you can be. Marine Week is no joke, not in that there's any tests you have to pass, but in that you're just constantly moving and on your feet. Do not fraternize with active-duty personnel, and do not do anything with fellow midshipmen that could comprise a SAPR violation, even if it seems consensual and like a good idea at the time. People do get caught and if you are one you will be on the next available flight home with a negative report sent to your home unit. (If you must engage in midcest, do it the last night before leaving.) Bring a book, as in a physical copy, to read and keep it in one of your cargo pockets. Other than Marine Week, there is a fuckton of downtime, especially during aviation week, and there are many times when you can't have your phone due to OPSEC concerns. Soak up all the information you can, especially regarding leadership and just the day-to-day military working life. That means have note-taking gear on your person all the time and write down the high points of everything. At this point in your career, you don't know what could or could not be important later on. Keep an open mind, especially. I'm a Marine-Option but I was fairly surprised by how much I liked about the Navy surface and sub stuff, too. PT at least every other day during the Navy weeks. It is very easy to get lazy and let your fitness fall by the wayside during CORTRAMID. However, each training day finishes about mid-afternoon, unless you're on a ship or sub or with the Marines. You have access to the gyms and more or less free roam of the base to run. Take advantage of this. Don't waste your money ordering pizza every night for dinner. Yes, the mess hall food sucks and it closes early. Suck it up; it's 4 weeks.    Overall, just use common sense and treat it like the highly relaxed learning environment that it is. This is the easiest training you will ever have in the military. I can't speak to what there is to do in San Diego (I went East and got to live it up in the absolute nothing that is Norfolk, VA) but don't make the mistake of just staying in your barracks room watching TV or playing on your phone during downtime. Get out and explore with your fellow mids; it really makes things fly by more quickly and more enjoyable in general."

Our SMO kept all  the prescriptions  and generally they stock up prior to deployment. 3. Not sure about that one. 4. They always told me it was based on the ship class. I know Oilers got their own, but AMMO ships shared. 5. Liberty was similar to USN, cept without all the crazy rules and you hit more ports as you must stay supplied to feed the fleet.

The pay kinda sucks for entry-level for the work, but I had kinda assumed there'd be extra benefits as well. I know they're generally out 6mo at a time.   I dunno, the traveling, the familiarity with the work I already have, and the ""free"" meals and housing for most of the year would make up for it for me.  Just put all my junk in a cheapo storage unit and stay in an extended stay hotel for the month I'm on shore, I guess.

navy,35y13g,kai908,7,Thu May 14 13:46:29 2015 UTC,"SSN (novel):       SSN (1996) is a novel created by Tom Clancy and Martin Greenberg following the missions of the U.S. Navy nuclear attack submarine USS Cheyenne (SSN-773) during a fictional war with China over the Spratly Islands, based on the video game of the same name.  A loosely connected collection of ""scenario"" chapters in support of the eponymous video game, the novel continues the Clancy tradition of large amounts of attention to detail, particularly regarding the description and use of various military equipment. It is, however, unique in one important way: true to the title, almost the entire book describes the operations of Cheyenne. Other Clancy books follow a more global path, featuring sub-plots, entire military operations, politics and personal sub-plots.  This is one of only three Clancy novels not falling into the Jack Ryan universe, the others being Red Storm Rising and Against All Enemies.

navy,35w6ju,baby_mike,10,Thu May 14 00:43:06 2015 UTC,It's really difficult to get out of submarines. If it comes out that he was depressed a lot they could very well remove him from the navy if they think he won't cut it. But really a past of being depressed doesn't mean it'll hit him when he's in the fleet. I know plenty of people that have been depressed and are making it fine. There's a lot of support for sailors with depression and the A-gang community is usually pretty tight. They're usually a salty bunch but they care about their own. The minute anyone in my division seems even a bit down they've got people checking if they're alright and give them support. Your bro will be fine.
navy,35w6ju,Korvilon,0,Thu May 14 01:55:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response. Is he still able to switch if he talks to his recruiter? He hasn't gone to A school or basic yet. I know he's going to do what he's going to do and that's fine but I'm just curious
navy,35w6ju,Korvilon,2,Thu May 14 02:00:24 2015 UTC,I believe it is possible yes. But it sure does piss off a lot of people. He can but some recruiters might not let him and it could look bad on his part for being indecisive. I don't know 100% though. If he does go in again they might end up sticking him with some more undesirable jobs. His choice of MMS isn't horrible. It's not the easiest job but it's a good experience and subs are a great money wise compared to other rates.

Many years ago I flunked out of college and applied for the NECP (predecessor to STA-21 Nuke Option).  I had a 1.95 GPA from college but discovered I really enjoyed studying nuclear power (also an ET) and decided I wanted to prove myself.  I studied for the SAT and did well so I applied for the program.  I took some heat during my interviews, but I was honest about my failures in college.  I was a lazy student with no goals in sight.  The navy helped me figure out what I wanted to do  and I wanted to push myself and become a submarine officer.  I think being honest about why I did so poorly was actually a plus for me.  Admittedly, I was doing well in A school and Power school because I enjoyed the material, but I still had to explain my college grades many times.   Including to the Admiral years later after I finished college.  I'm now CO of a submarine and I owe it to the Navy giving me a second chance.  If this is what you want, study hard and keep trying."

I'm currently trying to enlist with a bachelors and was looking at trying to go through OCS.   However my college GPA was about a 2.5-2.7, mostly due to A) having a difficult major (bio). B) Not really having a clearly defined goal for why I was getting that degree in the first place. and C) I was young and stupid and spent too much time interested in college life.  My recruiter has said that a GPA at that point wouldn't necessarily be competitive enough to be selected for OCS, but I think it may be something that I would want to do eventually, and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to.  This definitely makes me feel better about that not completely disqualifying me permanently.  So Thank you."

Now I'm not saying you WERE thinking about not listing your previous experience in any way, I just want to make sure that you've seen that you must list your previous schooling so you're good to go.   Number two, I dropped out of community college with a ~2.8 GPA as a business major after 3 semesters due to immaturity on my part. I busted my butt and proved to everyone that I am capable and graduated with a 3.6 Chemistry B.S..   You're on the right track, and there are people out there that have messed up and are mature enough to admit it. Tell the interviewer straight up that you messed up, you've fixed your ways and now you're a hard charger.

Additionally, the navy's air defense is generations ahead of all other navy's. now compare the amount of r and d required to build a new harpoon, and the navy is sitting pretty. my point is that it only takes 2 or 3 years to develop a ship killer, but decades to have the capability to shoot down the missile.  when you make a super secret squirrel society computer you can't just use any ol' chipset. that means the old cabinets you're referring to require the development of propriety systems, which take time.

If there were more sailors and ships and planes and all the rest then commands wouldn't have to choose between ""mission accomplishment"" and ""let's take a couple of hours to do PT right"".  If there are commands out there able to fit hours of PT into the work day then that's great! But don't let the rest of us know what commands those are, because the very minute the higher-ups figure that out they will be stripped bare of resources to go over to the commands that can barely get through their tasking, let alone worry about PT.  As a matter of priorities the Navy will never prioritize PT over the mission, and nor should it.  ""But just have the Sailor do it in their free time!"". Yeah, that's easy to say, but that harms retention directly (because why the hell would I re-enlist in a service that makes me do collateral anything after my 12-hour work day) and indirectly (PFA 'failures' of sailors who do quality work).  Now if we could be sure that the non-retainees in question are dirtbags this wouldn't even be bad. But are you sure your best sailors are the ones with the highest PFA scores?

Funny you bring Seabees into this because they definitely need to be in shape because their job requires them to be in combat zones. I found that out when I went to Iraq, if my battle buddy was wounded it was up to me to carry him to safety.  We should NEVER be unprepared just because some people some people ""don't or won't have to fight fires"". I think what some people forget being in the Navy is that we are the god damn military. we need to be prepared and physical fitness needs to be part of that.  I know that my examples are the extreme but when if we prepare for the worst when push comes to shove then we will be ready.  and yes I only address ""every Sailor is a firefighter"" because EVERY SAILOR IS A FIRE FIGHTER."

It is unreasonable to expect the whole service to be at a maximum but satisfactory is easily maintained.  There are other duty stations that emphasize fitness as part of the billet they fill and having above average past scores certainly aid in selection to fill these roles for both men and women.

I'll be interested to see what exactly gets changed and how many years it will take to go into effect...and how many people will complain about new moms getting 12 weeks off...

navy,35siop,rrobe53,4,Wed May 13 04:49:06 2015 UTC,No one is saying dads shouldn't get paternity leave. I read a different article about this which stated changing paternity leave would take an act of Congress (not sure if or why that is true) but that if/when it happened it would be for all services.   The physical act of giving birth made me feel like I had been hit by a truck. Took me days to feel even close to normal. Recovery time for c-sections is even longer. 6 weeks is a pitiful amount of time to heal and bond for a mother. 10 days for dads isn't awesome either but I can see why it isn't on the table now. Mabus is trying to retain and recruit women.
navy,35siop,nierlisse,3,Wed May 13 05:05:59 2015 UTC,"Yes. And I was in excellent physical shape and had an amazing birth with no complications. When my doctor said ""you should only be concerned if you pass a blood clot bigger than an egg,"" I knew I was going to be physically out of the game longer than I expected. There's a gaping wound inside the body after birth and it takes time to heal. I could barely shuffle to the bathroom afterward.   Six weeks is absolutely pitiful."
navy,35siop,Blinxs209,2,Wed May 13 06:52:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. The navy has always looked at it as ""what is the minimum a sailor needs to get back to work."" They don't care about the health of the women--just time and work lost. 42 days is when doctors say ""the bleeding should be stopped by week six."" But it doesn't mean they're physically healed or even physically ready to work. It is convalescent leave, nothing more.   Fathers getting time off is a nod to placate the male sailors. Break a bone or have major surgery, you can have just enough CONLEAVE to stand unaided at quarters too haha.   I absolutely agree we should give more paternity leave, it would do wonders for sailors satisfaction and family support. But don't misunderstand--we get leave after having a baby because we are convalescing, nothing more. In fact it is unfair that I don't get 10 free days of leave if my spouse gets CONLEAVE for something."

I would have taken unpaid, but that's not even an option. I needed four extra days after my six weeks and I got called and read the riot act when my chain saw my leave extension request. I'm not whining, I'm just saying that every male treats those six weeks as some glorious vacation and doesn't realize it's freaking CONVALESCENT LEAVE. It's ""the bleeding should stop sometime around the six week mark."" It is the barest of minimums with no sense of what's right or healthy for the new parent. And yes, I'm including in my statement both parents here, the 10 days bonus prize for new dads, because we should increase paternity leave. My personal opinion is that paternity leave is completely unfair--I don't get ten days of free leave if my spouse or dependent is injured, but a father got off and then gets 10 days free leave nine months later though, that's cool."
navy,35siop,BurningBushes2000,-1,Wed May 13 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"Paternity leave is unfair?  There is a huge difference between an injury and the birth of a child.    I'm sorry to say this, but we can't have it both ways.  I do agree that there should be longer than six weeks, but it's a career and it happens.    Think about this.  When Congress threatens us with cuts, we are the first to scream ""24/7 365, no off days, we're always on the clock, blah, blah, blah"" and point out how much we sacrifice and earn our pay.  Well, we can't really blame the Navy for utilizing us when we all know what we signed up for."
navy,35siop,Kailuafornia,1 point,Thu May 14 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"While I hyperbolized a small amount--because I do agree that paternity leave should be lengthened--my point was that CONLEAVE for the birth of a child right now, as it stands in the Navy, is simply for the mother to recover physically, nothing more. A father, who undergoes no physical trauma, gets 10 free days of leave.   42 days it the average amount of time for lochia to stop, and that's what we get. Look, I'm a pretty tough broad. I rolled through my pregnancy and birth like a boss. I was up and moving around as soon as physically possible. But I am telling you, that maternity leave is the barest minimum for a woman's body physically recover from the initial trauma of birth. It's not for ""bonding with the baby,"" or any other other reason. It is medically suggested time to convalesce, and you know what--the chain of command is not required to approve it! Did you know that? It is only a recommendation.   Yes, I know that the Navy is going to use me for every last bit they can squeeze out of me. So why do you get FREE DAYS for trauma your spouse experienced, but I don't?   And actually, while we're on this topic of paternity leave, does a lesbian spouse get ""paternity"" leave if her wife has a baby?"
navy,35siop,HBHT9,1 point,Thu May 14 03:56:37 2015 UTC,"Lochia:       In the field of obstetrics, lochia is the vaginal discharge after giving birth (puerperium) containing blood, mucus, and uterine tissue.  Lochia discharge typically continues for 4 to 6 weeks after childbirth.   It is sterile for the first 2 to 3 days, but not so by the third or fourth day, as the uterus begins to be colonized by vaginal commensals such as non-hemolytic streptococci and E. coli.

I had a divisional CC who was such a dick that he failed to ever put out dates for signing your exam waiver, and if I hadn't been paying attention and asked the CCCs, I'd have been forced to take the advancement exam in a rate I had -100 interest points in. Instead, I made sure I knew when all the waivers needed to be signed, and when I hit my year mark (literally like two days after), went up and got them to give me a FleetRIDE list (is that still a thing?), and I struck (now; important note: there are quotas for every month, and not every rate is always available). Had to wait a while to get orders though due to the particular rate and school. Edit: spelling is hard when you're high on caffeine.  Further edit: The only ""forcing"" I've ever heard of is when you get force reclassed to another rate. You either don't qualify for your previous rate (colorblindness seems to be a big one here) or the rate is being shut down or, well, some serious administrative shit is coming down the pipeline or a rate is massively overmanned (but I think in this case, in most cases they'd just early retire a bunch of people anyhow)."

I'm not saying that that is necessarily true or fair, but it's reality.    Also, what kind of example are we setting if our leaders can't be expected to follow fitness standards.  I've had an LPO who couldn't pass her PFA, and frankly, especially to the junior folks, it's a morale killer.   Just my 2 cents.  Carry on.   Edit: okay I get it.

But I never saw an LPO lose his or her job because of a PFA failure.  That's just weird.  LPOs are chosen in large part because of their technical abilities and leadership attributes.  I agree that PFA failure diminishes the leadership trait somewhat.  But it does not entirely negate it.  And it almost certainly has no bearing on technical capabilities.  I suppose chronic PFA failures would lead to an LPO losing a his or job.  But that would only be incidental to their ADSEP out of the Nav.

navy,35qaep,LordWillO,2,Wed May 13 02:08:36 2015 UTC,It all depends on how fast your command is willing to move.  You need to have PO indoc done before you can get frocked.

If you work with the MAW, they're fun. Uprank marines when speaking to them. They place a lot more emphasis on leadership and their NCOs are usually pretty damn on point. A lot of PFCs/E-2s act like SNs who've been in for a while. Lance corporals/E-3s are sort of like junior PO3s. Corporals are largely on par with PO2s or even PO1s, Sergeants are chiefs and anyone above that I treat like a senior or master chief.  Don't PT with marines. Especially don't PT with infantry. One today picked up a 50lb rock and ran up a near-vertical hill the size of a three floor building. He didn't break a sweat doing this. They're not smart but they've got retard strength. Don't drink with marines. Don't drink with marines. Don't. Drink. With. Marines. You may as well just mast yourself and save your command the trouble. Don't drink with marines. Don't drink with marines. If a marine says ""Trust me, this will be awesome"", go find a corpsman. If a marine says ""I think I can do this"", go find a corpsman. If a marine points at a highly venomous snake and says ""I'm going to piss it off and see if I can touch it"", go find a corpsman. Basically if a marine does anything which would maim your average low-functioning toddler, it doesn't hurt to preemptively find the nearest corpsman and learn a bit of PMARCHP.  Don't get into a pissing match with marines, especially infantry. Our boot camp says ""You're a basic bitch and the team is everything"" because we're training people to coexist on a ship. Their boot camp says ""You're an invincible killing machine and can touch pissed-off snakes."" because they're training people to stand in front of bullets. By and large they're very alpha and take a lot of stuff personally.  If it's not already standard issue, do whatever you can to get under a command that issues marine cammies. Their boots are amazing and the blouses are so much lighter than blueberries.  Unless there's a big navy component to the base, you probably won't find much navy-specific gear in the MCX. Stock up on your own uniform items if you aren't getting issued greenside stuff, especially things like dixie cups which you won't find in the right size or good condition more likely than not."

navy,35rbha,Silidistani,5,Tue May 12 22:17:17 2015 UTC,"First off congratulations, you lucky bastard.  I've not actually worked with the Marines there much, but been there several times and the base is large and quite nice actually.  There's a great pool and gym, housing is good quality for a Navy base and there's plenty to do on base, it's a big place.    Kailua is right there and Kalama park is gorgeous - but let's be honest most of the beaches on Oahu are.  You can kayak to them easily or, if you're a good swimmer, just swim to Moku Nui islands (the Mokes) just at the bend south of Kaneohe, it's a fun picnic and you can swim around them and jump off rocks and all that, I never tire of that little excursion for some reason.  Good workout too if you swim it, did it in moderate waves once and it was a challenge - watch the riptide - but it's less than a mile though, so you're right there anyway and it's usually pretty calm.  It's a very quick 15-minute jump on the H3 across/under the mountains to Pearl and north Honolulu, and if you head the slightly-southern route on Pali Hwy (Highway 61) you get to the Pali Lookout which is simply breathtaking and a place I have just stopped at to take in the view and decompress many times when driving over.  Downtown Honolulu and Diamondhead and all that are that route, so you can hit clubs or whatever.  There are plenty of watering holes right where the 61 comes into Kailua though, that's way closer, literally 10 minutes to the gate.  You're away from the haphazardness of Pearl and congestion of Honolulu yet not too far away and morning views at dawn are going to be amazing, daily.  I'd live there in an instant if ... wait, why don't I live there again?  Hmmm.  With all that the Kaneohe side offers, does it really matter that you'll be working with rifleman they taught to fly?  Not to me.  ;-)"

navy,35nn0v,kathleenborgmann,6,Mon May 11 23:56:51 2015 UTC,"She may not have other options. What do you mean by ""she needs a divorce?"" It seems fishy that she has less than a year of service and a one-year old child. The Navy specifically does not allow this to happen in your first tour - I am missing critical parts of this story.  The Family Care Plan is a document that tells the Navy what the arrangements are for your child(ren) when you are unable to care for them. There are 3 parts, one for less than 30 days, one for more than 30 days and one for involuntary evacuation. I have a FCP because my husband and I are both military.  Agreeing to become this child's ""foster parent"" is a big deal - you will be responsible for a child, financially and medically."
navy,35nn0v,Poopkitty,5,Tue May 12 00:20:41 2015 UTC,"Here's the Navy instruction on Family Care Plan: http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/support/21st_Century_Sailor/readiness/Pages/FamilyCarePlan.aspx  It is a tool the Navy uses to ensure their sailors are prepared for deployment. We aren't allowed to use our families as an excuse to get out of work, duty, or deployments. In order to ensure the sailor is fully prepared to leave their family while deploying, this is a sort of checklist that shows sailors all the things they need to provide (caregivers, financial care, Power of Attorneys, passports for dependents, etc). The sailor fills it out and gives it to their command. This way there's absolutely no confusion or ambiguity and the sailor can't say ""but I didn't know I needed a caregiver while I was on deployment!"" ....ignorance of the policy is never an acceptable excuse.   Just because your sailor does not want to leave her child in the custody of an abusive parent does not mean she needs a Family Care Plan. She needs to get sole custody of her child--and THEN the Navy will request a Family Care Plan. Right now the Navy is assuming (rightfully so) that her husband will have custody of the child while she's deployed (because he's the father and there's no legal paperwork say he doesn't get custody or visitation rights etc).  It sounds as though she's trying to give you custody instead of her husband--you are probably about to mix yourself up in a huge mess. I suspect the father/husband would be able to claim you kidnapped his child....especially if you take the baby out of state.   As far as being temporarily in custody of a child whose parent(s) is(are) deployed, you are responsible for that child as if it is your own. The Power of Attorney that I gave my childcare provider gives them the power to fly out of the country with my child, enroll/dis-enroll them in school, seek medical attention or care....to basically treat them as their own child. (It is a terrifying thing for a parent, quite frankly, to sign temporary custody of my child over while I deploy--but let me not digress).  You need to ask her if she's sought out Family Advocacy assistance for the abuse, if she's taking steps for divorce, if her husband is going to willingly give up custody and if she can provide some sort of legal paperwork showing that you're legally going to be ""in loco parentis"" of her child. You need to ask her for proof of her financial support for the child when in your custody (bank allotments, check, does she just expect you to foot the bill for everything?), and information on who is going to get the child to you--does she expect you to drop everything and drive over to pick up her child at a second's notice?   In short...you should not get involved.   EDIT: Let me say this, as well: I have been approached to be on Family Care Plans in the past. It is no small undertaking. I have also said yes, and also had to say no. It is a hard thing, to say ""no,"" because I understand that urge to help a friend out, especially when the situation seems so dire.....and when we think about ""abandoning that poor child to such a terrible situation!"" the guilt gets laid on thick. However, the voice of reason in this particular case says ""do not get involved."" What we present on facebook often is a distorted picture of reality. Being facebook friends with someone you haven't seen in six years is hardly on the same level as hanging out every weekend with your best friend."

I got orders to a replenishment oiler in Norfolk coming out of boot camp. My class admin said I had the best orders in the stack that he'd seen. When I finally looked at mine, I was let down. When I asked him about it he says ""I'm from Norfolk."" Perception counts for a lot. Most recently, I'd been enjoying a civilian career in the Seattle area. I took a 6 month TDY to the middle of nowhere Montana and learned about 5 months into that TDY that I had been quietly MDR'd (Management Directed Reassignment) to a location 4.5 hours east of Seattle. No more baseball games, no more concerts, pretty much no more anything fun. My counterparts are likely facing a RIF next year but I'll be pretty much untouchable because the workload out here is tremendous. Its not my ideal place to be, but I'm learning to deal with it. I fish a bit, shoot a lot, and am currently running down some spots for coyote and waterfowl hunting. Most of these, by the way, I couldn't do in Seattle.  Get out of the house. Fishing is great even if you throw everything back. Start hitting the gym. Get into a local community college and start knocking out pre reqs at 1/5 the cost of a normal 4 year university. Get into a local softball league, bowling league, or some other sport you might want to try out. NTelos in Portsmouth hosts any number of acts you might find entertaining. Someone you know would go to those. Bum a ride, split gas money. Incidentally, Rob Zombie is playing there on June 5th. I missed that show in '96 because I had duty that night and would go pretty far out of my way to make this one if I was anywhere near the area.  The point is nowhere will be fun if you just get off work, crash in the berthing, and wait for lights out so you can do it all over again the next day. I'm still pissed about this MDR, but I have to admit that the place is what you make of it.  Also, don't buy a car from a dealer that has all the usual shit about ""no credit, slow credit, bad credit, we finance E1 and up, you can ride today, we'll even pick you up."" Go to Navy Federal, get an amount you can comfortably pay after shelling out for insurance and gas, then look for something reasonable within your budget, usually from a private sale.

The Navy is just absolute shit at keeping accountability on their contractors.  I was talking to a foreman over at one of the big shipyards in Norfolk. His company gets paid by billable man hours. The more warm bodies he can stuff onto a ship during the course of a day, filling out bullshit work requests, the more he gets paid.   He has a guy on his staff that runs around town rounding up as many warm bodies as possible. He gets a tax break for hiring felons, sex offenders, the mentally handicapped, etc. They also VASTLY inflate their training costs. This means when they fire one of these motherfuckers, they get ANOTHER tax break to hire another warm body.  TL;DR He makes more money by hiring the absolute biggest fuckups possible.  Then you have the guy hired on full time to stall and delay and divert the Navy as long as possible. Most of your department heads are either too incompetent, or too overworked to really truly maintain accountability on shit the yardbirds break. The longer the shipyard can stall when it comes to fixing a problem, the greater the probability that the problem will got lost in the paperwork shuffle and never fixed on the contractors dime. Then, when the next avail. or CMAV rolls around, the contractor gets paid to fix it.  No senior people in the Navy give a shit, because every time the shipyard fucks up, the dollar amount goes higher, and it looks even better on a FITREP to oversee a $15mil dollar project vs a $10mil project.

navy,35jksj,Punic_Hebil,7,Mon May 11 01:53:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know about an all-out war with China... But I can imagine some low-intensity engagements happening if things degenerate. Kind of like what we're doing to ISIS. We're not going to full-scale war, we're just dropping some bombs and ""advising"" the Iraqi's.  If full-scale war with China did happen, we'd probably be fucked simply because of the international relations they have. North Korea would instantly seize the opportunity to go to town against South, Japan and the Philippines would be turned into war-zones, and the world economy would be gravely damaged; I don't even know what Russia would do. The only thing we would be able to do to end such a war would be nuclear strikes or carpet bombing until they surrendered (or inversely, they do the same until we surrender), because we can't possibly occupy mainland China. Too much land and too many people to control. The same would be true if China tried to occupy us. A real, full-scale war with China would not be winnable by either side unless we acknowledged the inevitability of massive civilian slaughter. I don't know if either side wants that."
navy,35jksj,minigunman123,2,Mon May 11 02:26:23 2015 UTC,"Quantity has a quality all its own. The biggest issue issue is having weapons that are effective against a carrier group. Even though we can shoot one down, how many abmm's can a carrier group deploy in a 5 minute window? China is capable of just pumping these things out. At the start of any local conflict, there will only be 1, maaaabye 2 carrier groups near the scene. If they decided to bum rush 2-300 of these at once, plus your other anti ship measures, how many would get through?  By taking out our local platform for air superiority, they can have the time to complete initial goals and entrench themselves to where it is much more difficult for us to operate in zone.  Carriers are big slow targets, but there aren't many non nuclear weapons that can reliably hit them from that kind of range."
navy,35jksj,baldwadc,-3,Mon May 11 12:20:03 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the absolutely insane amount of money we spend on our military. China is modernizing quickly, but for every dollar they spend on their aircraft carrier, we're spending enough to build four more, along with technology that is quickly eschewing the definition of ""science fiction."" They're talking about having enough vehicles to actually mobilize two million troops, we're building lasers and rail guns."
navy,35jksj,faustrex,2,Mon May 11 05:29:22 2015 UTC,"Our budget is possibly the worst metric to measure our military might on.  It's more than doubled from 2000 to 2015. China's has been about quintupled in the same timespan. And you know what? We waste entirely too much money on stupid projects and research like the already-failed-F-35 program (which is also way over budget), while China can learn from our mistakes (and our successes).  Not only that, but our military budget of ~600 billion, is used to maintain bases, ships, carriers, airfields, teams, and operations, in the entire globe, to maintain a security presence around the entire world.  China has literally only its immediate surroundings to care about.  If proportionate spending were an indicator of military effectiveness, China would already be more powerful than us. But it's not. Spending for military between two different cultures, with two different economies, with two different economic structures and political structures, and two different currencies, on two different sides of the planet, with two different goals (ours is to maintain global security, theirs is to specifically dominate their region and keep us out)... It's just dumb. The two militaries are not capable of being compared, solely by their budgets."

There are lots of work stations everyone, fancy databases. People are doing cyber stuff. Research, operations, etc. Some CTNs are on keyboard doing operations. Some CTNs are defensive, watching scanners, checking out signatures, finding out who is trying shenanigans against our networks. We do that for a couple hours, get some lunch. Come back, do it all again a few more hours. Maybe go to PT, done either way by 1600, sometimes earlier. Come back and do it again the next day. Mon-Fri at my place.  A few of the defensive guys are on night shifts, which is basically the above, but it's dark and the desks aren't nearly as full since more people are on days.  Evenings and weekends are liberty to do pretty much what you want. Once in a while we stand duty, but it's a 10 day watch rotation on shore so not deadly. In two weeks I estimate I will have no one lower than CTN2, so that means my entire division will be living in town on BAH. CTN isn't bad at all.

Edit: be warned though, I've heard tell of the navy possibly phasing out the diver rate and giving the job to contractors. If you want to be navy diver certified though there's a couple different ways of doing it; go the EOD pipeline where you'll still have to pass a PST with different standards though.

If you are going to a ship, I highly recommend something collapsible, like your seabag, because storage is at a premium and there's no good place to stuff a suitcase.  Along that line, if you're on a ship:  shower shoes  minimal civvies (like, 5 to 8 changes of clothes, you don't have room for eighty pairs of shoes)  your entire seabag  Whatever electronics you want--keep in mind, space is at a premium.

navy,35fqy7,radhaz,1 point,Sun May 10 00:09:03 2015 UTC,"Coming from the surface community this is a tough pill to swallow.   Nav's know navigation because they're second tour divo/dept heads, JO's with SWO and you can't get SWO without learning Navigation.  Engineers are generally vetted the same way, in that CHENGs are screened beforehand and do not qualify to be a CHENG without their engineer letters.  Weapons officers aren't really screened in such a fashion, sure they're going to be SWO but that doesn't prepare them for being a WEPS. Sometimes you'll see a prior Ordo/Gunno and those ones do just fine.  Ultimately WEPS is a feeder for the CSO position, if an officer doesn't cut it as a WEPS then the CO isn't going to move them up thus we could amend your original statement to state ""but CSO's know combat systems"".  I love to complain, but in this capacity I ""think"" the model has worked for me."

navy,35fqy7,Warbond,2,Sun May 10 07:25:09 2015 UTC,"As has been mentioned, the premise seems (on the surface at least) to be a little far-fetched. Even a moderately sized ship has enough going on that it needs hundreds of people with years of training and experience to run it. Even being onboard and knowing everything about your job doesn't mean you know anything about anybody else's, beyond the very basics.  This is where science-fiction could come to the rescue with a lot of automated technology. A lot of electronic systems already spit out fault codes and the like that tell you something is wrong, if not necessarily how to fix it. Buff that concept a little bit, and with some creative questions it's feasible that a layperson could figure out some of the more rudimentary aspects of astro-navigation or fire control or the like.  Beyond which, there are stacks of manuals that tell you pretty much exactly how to do almost anything. We have something called the Combat Systems Operational Sequencing System that will tell you (more or less) how to initialize and run gun mounts, radars, gyroscopes, etc. Engineering has a similar system called Engineering Operational Sequencing System that does the same thing for engines and generators and fire pumps and all sorts of stuff. Again, it seems like it would be pretty trivial to have a character use a tablet or ask the computer or something like that to pull up the main engine start-up sequence.  In order to more fully answer your question, I think we need to know a bit more about what exactly your characters are going to be doing on this warship. That will help us figure out what you mean by ""essential""."
navy,35fqy7,Warbond,2,Sat May 9 23:38:13 2015 UTC,"First, just to clarify, it's a military starship. I'm assuming that automation brings the crew down well below modern requirements. The new crew will be taking the time to at least study the manuals and train using simulators and the like. I know things will be very rough, and it will take them time to work things out."
navy,35fqy7,QuarterlyGentleman,1 point,Sat May 9 23:49:01 2015 UTC,"Then I'd say, knowing nothing about space travel (or underwater travel, for that matter), the biggest jobs to consider would be the ones that keep people alive. You have to have some sort of power generation or nothing else will work. From there you need to maintain breathable air in the short term and food and water in the longer term. That would be enough to just survive. Oh, and throw in hull integrity, because, you know, space.  On a ship water isn't much of an issue because we're surrounded by it. We just suck up the water, run it through some filters, then pop in some chemicals and call it good. On a ship, you'd have to recycle everything that gets used, and there'd still be plenty of waste in one form or another, so I doubt you could go very long without getting resupplied. A modern ship can carry approximately 14-20,000 gallons of fresh water, so depending on the size of the vessel and the number of people onboard, that would definitely be a concern.  Propulsion wouldn't be much use without navigation. Weapons are probably going to rely heavily on fire control systems. Firing a big gun is one thing and on certain systems can currently be done locally, but firing any sort of missile is going to be a whole other story.   As for leadership positions... They aren't exactly necessary other than having a single point of control and a defined chain of command and overall structure. The CO and XO can't spend their time talking to every Seaman Timmy about what's going on on the ship, so the pyramid-structured chain of command filters out the mundane, unimportant, or unnecessary information to allow the big wigs to make informed and timely decisions. Without being forced to behave in that way, I doubt many civilians are going to default to that decision-making structure."

navy,35fqy7,ItemSix,1 point,Sun May 10 03:06:04 2015 UTC,My fix to most complaints: they could be former private sector sailors that had never crewed a military ship. Thus they can run a vessel and have a command structure but the transition could carry a lot of interesting drama.

Sure you could probably get a few twelve year-olds hard by having a guy who drives boats and a guy who fires all the missiles, but anyone with any degree of nautical knowledge is going to rip you a new asshole the moment you don't know the difference between plotting a course (navigation) and steering that course (helm).

navy,35fqy7,happybadger,1 point,Sat May 9 23:25:33 2015 UTC,"Yes and I applaud you for that, but it's not something you can learn in any authoritative way without first experiencing it. Everything your civilian raiders attempt, the sailors would have been drilled to death on how to prevent it (moreso if the command thought there was even the remotest possibility of it happening). Everything that a ship requires to function, the sailors doing it studied for months or in some cases years to do it and much of it is using equipment that has no civilian equivalent either due to age or specialisation. The jobs you'd think are most important aren't the jobs that make the ship move, the jobs that do aren't what they seem like (look at damage controlmen, the firefighters. They mostly just maintain breathing equipment), and the hierarchy and division of labour is such a convoluted and counterintuitive system that you'd just be paraphrasing a wikipedia article if you had to explain why an eighteen year-old is handling the controls on a nuclear submarine.   If you want a quick buck, there are parts of the military that are much easier to write about. If you want to write something with substance to it, the navy is a world in its own and the reviewers are going to rip your book apart if you don't come from that world."

Realistically the 10 PM rule is not very set in stone as long as you're not like, having sexy time. Might crimp your style."

navy,359xg6,NioNai,3,Fri May 8 09:53:12 2015 UTC,It was very surprising how little my command's admin shop knew about my retirement process. It was a relief when I actually spoke to the person at PSD that would be doing my paperwork. Are you saying that your local PSD is unable to get you these answers? Or have you been dealing with only your admin shop? What have your CMC and N1 LCPO been doing to sort this out?
navy,359xg6,papafrog,1 point,Fri May 8 10:49:18 2015 UTC,"So a little bit more explaining.  I have not spoken with my CMC on this subject yet, Before when I applied my Senior and Chief had both worked with me along with our new NC2 (he is still currently learning as he rated over) the information before was that I would go on my terminal leave, stay in Japan in the barracks for terminal leave and then 10 prior to my EAOS I would be flown to Washington. This meant I had a place to stay and I could plan everything out here while I was on leave.  However what I'm being told now is that I will be flown to Washington before I start terminal leave and won't be flown back leaving me to find a place to live while I'm on terminal in the states. (this will be before I start school, So I will not have BAH from 9/11 yet for housing, also because I will still be active service)Which is where I'm confused, if I would receive BAH since I will no longer be in the same country anymore as my barracks.  As of now I do not know about PSD, I brought this question up because a few hours ago I was told about this, since it's backwards from what I had been told before.  Next Wensday I'll be going over to PSD to spend the day there and get as many answers as possible, but If I can find something out prior it would be very helpful so I can ask them in more detail or provide instructions on it to help the process along. And this would also allow me to adjust my budget with the school.   If I can still stay on leave here before doing the out process in Washington then that will save me 2 months of housing/food before I fly back, but if it's the way it was just told to me today then I need to start contacting my school about setting up housing now so that I am guaranteed a appartment, or if they will even let me live on campus prior to my starting semester.  Thank you for helping me here."
navy,359xg6,Hadeshorne,2,Fri May 8 10:55:31 2015 UTC,"I don't have the relevant instructions on hand, due to being at home and not at work. However, I've sent plenty of people EOAS from Japan.   You're going to go to Washington and stay in the provided barracks there while they do the out process thing. While you're there you get the chow hall and all that other barracks jazz.  After out processing you will be sent to your home of record, and they shouldn't be taking the food money(which seems to be your main concern). You'll continue to take your pay minus COLA and any special pay you may get for being in Japan."

I'm curious if I'll have to pay for rent off of my base pay during leave, if so that's going to eat up about $1400 dollars of my terminal leave base pay alone.

You may be able to take the test at MEPS; ask a recruiter.   If you enlist or earn a commission you should definitely take the DLPT (defense language proficiency test) and keep yourself on the command's list of foreign language speakers. Should they call on you to translate you can get FLPP (foreign language proficiency pay) for the month. Can vary in amount but I got $500 for the month I translated on the bridge for our CO.

navy,3591wf,BurningBushes2000,2,Sat May 9 02:20:53 2015 UTC,"I know an Arabic linguist from work who also majored in Arabic while in school. Speaking a language is not the same as majoring in it. Majoring in the language focuses on the roots of the words, grammatical rules, origins, etc. DLI focuses on speaking and translation so you can speak it fluently. The two aren't comparable according to him. One is learning how to be a linguist and the other is learning how to understand advanced linguistic theory of a language.   Think of an English Major. We can all speak English fairly well but unless you majored in English we know nothing beyond speaking."

I am kinda bummed I lost my aircrew orders, but I met my husband on my first duty station as an HT (I was crash and smash POIC, he was part of the helo det that got underway with us; we spent long hours on the flight deck and he quickly became my best friend...after three duty stations of long distance relationship/dating we got married, and here we are!)  It was about a decade ago that I attended DLI. my closest navy friends are still CTIs; they say it hasn't changed too much, but I'm sure there's a CTI here who would be better qualified to answer your questions lol.   We got iPods issued to us with course material on it, long hours of studying....by the end of the first semester you are speaking, writing, reading entirely in your target language.

Upper level grammar is something you do in second year language classes at University.  Studying grammar and how to speak a language is only a small amount of what language degrees study.

Mr. Axe makes the argument that the LCS is replacing the PC's and that it would be more cost effective to just build a new class of PC's.  This suggestion would be a cost effective strategy, if LCS were only replacing PC's.  In fact, the LCS is replacing PC's, MCM's, and FFG's...not just PC's.  If we were to build three new classes of ships to replace the three we're losing, that would cost substantially more than the LCS program does.  Replacing three classes of ships with a single class (or two, in the case of LCS) is the exact frugality that Mr. Axe is arguing for.  Now, whether the LCS will be as good at the PC/MCM/FFG missions is a completely different story and one that I'm not sure we can really address just yet.  But to say that we should begin building 1 for 1 replacements for each retiring class in order to save money is a patently false argument.  Also, to forestall all the ""yay build a new FFG"" crowd, here's a really interesting article on how the OHP class faced the EXACT same criticisms in the 1970's as the LCS does today. http://nextnavy.com/the-ffg-7-the-lcs-of-the-seventies/"

We are working on #2 in seven years with 4 hulls (2 even and 2 odd) in the water.   I repeatedly have heard SURFPAC/SURFLANT/N96 talk about how the Navy is all in on LCS. They talk about I know multiple COs in the pipeline and on LCS. No one has a clear idea on how to employ them yet.  Honestly, MIW (mines-not IOC) and its underwhelming SUW are not what the fleet needs.  The two most promising missions remain long range ASCM platform and ECM/ECCM platform (neither of which exist and ECM isnt even a thought).  ASW with MH-60Rs, Mk54 Torps, and Veritable Depth Sonar (fuck you and your thermoclines subs) is an exception. This combined with her speed is going to be a nightmare for diesel subs.  SURFOR is working on upping the ASCM game but its a long way out.  If we had simply built upgraded OHP FFGs...based on Australia's hull upgrades. We could have saved 30-50%, had two-three times the range, and not have insane training/manning/maintenance paradigm shifts.  The surface navy has tried rotational crews on Spruance Class (failed), DDG (Arliegh Burkes) Failed, MCMs - Failed, PCs- Failed....  So why will this work?

Same issues as surface ships with rotational crews but their only saving grace is that QA and the Nuke mindset on subs tends to keep things from getting out of hand.     Also, as member of the PC Navy, our biggest issue isn't even maintenance, it's record keeping. Each crew would keep their own records and take them with them. So when we took permanent charge of the hull we had little to no continuity of our personnel, maintenance, or logistical records. Our COSAL is all jacked up because no one was pressing to keep it up to date with all of our ship alts and COTS gear. Without permanent crews you will constantly have problems with this. That will be the biggest downfall for the LCS platform."

navy,351623,DBHT14,1 point,Sun May 10 16:26:59 2015 UTC,The problem is that the LCS simply will not be able to do what the PC can do as well as a PC. It's too big and draws too much water. We need to continue to have small patrol boats in the fleet. That's not to say that the LCS doesn't have a place but a 330 foot vessel simply cannot do some of the things that a 179 foot vessel can.
navy,351623,SailorAground,1 point,Wed May 6 18:50:13 2015 UTC,"Again, that was never my argument, nor was it the argument of the article.  His argument was that the LCS is a one for one replacement for the PC and that it makes more sense to buy an actual PC instead of the LCS because it would be cheaper AND better.  I have no doubt that a PC would be better at PC missions than an LCS; however, it would not be cheaper.  Buying a one for one replacement for the PC  would also necessitate a new MCM and a new FFG.  While those three ship classes might be better at their individual missions, it would in no way be cheaper for the Navy to buy three classes instead of one.  A new FFG alone has seen forecasts that start at $700 million (and quickly go up).  Add to that figure the cost of a new PC and a new MCM class and you'll be well over a billion dollars for just one of each platform.  Compare that to the per-platform cost of LCS of roughly $550 million and it becomes very clear that LCS is a cheaper alternative.  Like I said in my original post, whether it is a better alternative, is a different story."
navy,351623,themadhatter99,1 point,Sun May 10 16:13:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, use LCS to replace the MCM and FFG, but there's not much that can replace a PC for the same price point. We're ridiculously cheap to buy, repair, and operate. The cost of one Cyclone-class Patrol Coastal ship is somewhere in the ballpark of $26 million, whereas one LCS is about $500 million. Add onto that each mission module for about $100 million a pop. Oh, and did I mention we are procuring two hulls (how's that for one hull for three ships?) so logistical costs will be enormous because we will need two separate supply chains.   But PCs have supply chains too!?! They sure do. We utilize mainly COTS parts so we can buy them off of any commercial parts dealer. Oh, and our weapons are all fairly common to all branches of service, so the procurement costs for those are cheap.   Either way you swing it, PCs are great for what they were designed to do and no LCS is going to replace them for the same bang for buck.  TLDR: PCs are expendable, littoral patrol boats who get the mission done for cheap."

navy,351623,m007368,3,Wed May 6 14:29:39 2015 UTC,"Opening statement: PCs are pretty darn good little ships at coastal patrol and shallow water support, e.g. the Gulf.  Reverse punch: they suck at anything else.  How's that sea state 7 patrol look?  Dunno, the crew was doped out on no-puke meds, and hull stresses mounted too.    Also I'd like to see even a few PCs take on an LCS for literally anything.  The Mk 38 has an effective range of ~3000 yds, the Mk 110 9000+, and with smart rounds too.  The radars and sensor suites on the LCSs (not to mention actually having combat management systems) are far superior 3D tracking systems, the PCs have Furunos.  LCSs have missiles, choppers, drones and towed arrays.  PCs have a few machine guns and some Stingers, maybe occasionally a Griffin.  PCs are good at their role: quick-response shallow water patrol and intercept and their crews are well-trained for this role it seems.  Let's stop pretending that PCs are good any anything other than this - the Navy doesn't build bigger ships because we want to, we do it because the platform's missions demand it.  Also, at 14 feet of draft, the Independence-class LCSs aren't exactly icebergs.    LCS has a major issue with its logistics chain for mission modules, and it's ironic that a Littoral Combat Ship isn't supposed to actually do much, if any, major combat of its choosing, but let's not pretend their mission can be replaced by patrol craft."

They're not fast, they can't shoot far, they're not stealthy, and they're old. It's definitely time to let the OHPs retire.

navy,351623,Keyserchief,1 point,Wed May 6 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"I can see an advantage to this. Its multi-role functionality I think (and honestly hope) will make this class more versatile. So in a way, yea the first ship in a class is always broken, and as we see it from the outside this new 'class' concept is broken, but I think is because its so different and requires different style of thinking.

navy,351623,SkepticNerdGuy,0,Wed May 6 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"It cant replace 3 different classes of ship. It has less survivability than a commercial craft. Has to return to port to change missions, and that is only if the moduals and crew are there waiting for them. It is a disaster.   Thought up by people who saw the military as a business. The irony is it was suppose to save money but it costs us in readiness, cost over runs and serviceability. Too few crew to do maintenance as well. IT is a disaster."
navy,351623,Peoplewander,1 point,Wed May 6 15:14:09 2015 UTC,"I tend to disagree, it might be because I was forced into the program, and have been spoon fed some of the 'kool-aid'.

navy,351623,Peoplewander,1 point,Wed May 6 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"I've heard so much hate about the Littoral Combat Ships over the years any anti-navy article I know will at some point will mention them.  And they are not wrong.  They are being built for a problem that never existed... specifically we would be fighting a ton in shallow coastal waters.  Every year that prospect looks increasingly unlikely yet we are still due to get fifty of the things.    But that's the calculation this piece mentions, would you like seven ships for 3.4 billion or forty ships for 2.8 billion, if you drop that down to thirty ships you have a billion or so to operate all those ships for seven years to boot.    But it's the cost we pay, no matter what is built it will be billions one way or another, but the force mix we end up with at the end of the day... won't be pretty."

Choose your rate, choose your fate. It is much easier to get what you want now than later. If your ASVAB scores are good enough you might try holding out for what you want. What isn't available now might be available at a later date. Wanting to ship out ASAP will greatly reduce your options. Don't be afraid to play some hardball with the recruiter if necessary.  That all being said, EM is one of the more practical rates that can transfer very well into a civilian job."

navy,34vz30,espositojoe,4,Tue May 5 00:36:03 2015 UTC,"Let's put Randy Forbes through a yard period. The two I've been through were worse than deployments. In all seriousness I volunteered on an IA to avoid my third wow I was on sea duty. Now that may only be a particular command issue but I haven't heard to many sailors brag about yard periods.  In all seriousness this also brings up quality control issues as much as we preach and teach junior personnel QA most think it's a joke when they're getting told to hurry up on everything so we can start the next project.  The contractors for modernization will be no better.    At estimated savings of 4.5 billion dollars are we really hurting that badly that we need a all cruisers updated as possible.   Both of these plans are sorry and only seem to be addressing a problem from a bad perspective.  Even if we did go through with Forbes ridiculous five year plan that put our Cruiser fleet at 36 years old.  How long are we going to pour money into a 40+ year old design?  Also technology is changing faster than it ever has and Navy doesn't have ability to keep up with it,  it never has. We have ask ourselves; is upgrading the right answer?  I know we want a standard across the board but,  at some point we will have to learn to settle with X or move on to Y. Not keep piling new stuff onto an already beaten horse and spending ridiculous amounts of money to do so.    We're not fighting to keep up with another nations fleet or anything at the moment (at least not like WW2 or anything). We only fight to keep up with ourselves. This money would better be invested in maintenance, more personnel, or research and development.    Anyone thats been invited on (some) other nations ships have seen the quality and care that goes into maintaining that vessel. I believe these people realize they can get the same goal done with what they already have.  The U.S needs to realize the same.  We have to step forward not drag our old boots forward like we've continued to do for so long."
navy,34vz30,Grundy45,2,Tue May 5 12:48:34 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the statement ""We only fight to keep up with ourselves.""  When it comes to air defense, missile defense, and electronic warfare in particular, we are behind the power curve in many areas.  It takes money to play in these arenas, more importantly, it requires adaptability and fast response to new challenges.  Guess what two things the Navy totally fucking sucks at. There are all sorts of bright shiny new systems that are functionally obsolete, or mismatched to actual needs by the time they hit the fleet, because our procurement system is such a complete shitshow.  You hit the nail on the head on quality issues with shipyards though. Seeing the Navy manage a yard period is what convinced me to get out after a single enlistment. I don't trust these motherfuckers to run a hot dog stand properly, let alone my life."

There's a decent auto hobby shop, car wash, bowling alley, and mini-NEX right by the barracks there and the gym is new and there's a McD's close, so all your immediate needs are right there.  Right out the front gate is a big ass NEX and further down the road is a huge Commissary.  It's ~3 miles from the oceanfront and about the same distance from a small base called Dam Neck.  That's the base to go to for the beach as its mil only or many locals drive further south to Sandbridge beach to avoid tourists.  The overall Oceana area is pretty self contained with most of the action being in the Strawbridge/Red Mill area (where I live) and south of Oceana is pretty quiet as most air traffic doesn't head that way (or I've grown deaf to it)."

navy,34wb1t,ImTheGuy0,5,Tue May 5 02:17:55 2015 UTC,Talk to your Primary Care Provider or your eye clinic.
navy,34wb1t,Poopkitty,3,Tue May 5 02:23:04 2015 UTC,"As poopkitty said, talk to your medical. Specifically, your primary care provider or optometry. That said, there are some caveats. There can be a very long wait list, up to a year, in some commands and in addition to that, if you have less than a year left on your contract you can forget getting any elective surgery (like Lasik/PRK). I paid for mine out of my own pocket - 3k. If it comes to that, you need to route a chit through the CoC asking for permission. I routed mine, didn't hear back in time, so I ended up having the surgery anyway and taking personal leave to handle my recovery. Will they grant you medical leave to cover an optional procedure you have done out in town? I don't know. Probably good to ask.  All that aside, there's still yet another question. Do you want PRK or Lasik? Do you know the difference? If not, bone up. I worked in medical and had a couple optometrists I worked under refuse to give referrals or continue conversations past the initial stages with patients when they weren't aware of which they wanted or why they wanted that specific procedure. The two procedures are vastly different, as are recovery times and risks to each. I recommend boning up on both. Historically, the Navy has been doing PRK procedures for about 30 or 40 years if I remember correctly, but I heard rumblings they were getting into Lasik five or six years ago. Haven't kept up. Or hell, you could end up with a doc that doesn't care one way or the other and gives you a greenlight as soon as you ask.  Personally, I had PRK. Recovery was about a week, couldn't even open my eyes for two days and it was pretty hellish for three or four. Afterwards, my vision is way above average and I still consider it the best thing I ever spent a dollar on. No more dealing with foggy glasses when I walk out the door."
navy,34wb1t,pepsiredtube,1 point,Tue May 5 03:49:27 2015 UTC,"Solid advice from the others, step one is two stable eye exams, usually a year apart, but I believe they can accept them 6 months apart. So if you haven't had one, get one ASAP and start doing your research.  I'm gonna disagree on the PRK/LASIK comment though. Asked my civilian optometrist before I joined what the deal was and he said he didn't know any doctor who would do PRK over LASIK because they are essentially the same procedure but with vastly different recovery times. If you have any aspirations of flying for the navy, you're going to need PRK though."
navy,34wb1t,Charlestonian,2,Tue May 5 10:37:57 2015 UTC,So my last vision test was at boot camp and it has been only 3 months then. Does this mean I will need to wait for a vision test that is far enough away from my first until I can get on the waiting list?

When I requested prk because I scuba dive and I was concerned about pressure and the lasik flap, the doc straight laughed at me. He said the doc at the clinic eho does all the lasik procedures pretty much spearheaded lasik in the navy and that they don't do prk unless the patient can't get lasik. He also informed me that intra lasik is fine for activities that may encounter sudden pressure changes.  Now fast forward to me stationed in hawaii. Lasik/prk was done by the army and they did prk over lasik.   My experience is completely anecdotal, but I haven't had any issues doing anything with lasik. If you can, get lasik over prk IMO."

Also idk if you have started routing it through the NMTI's or not but if it hasn't started yet it probably won't be happening cause that shit has to go to the CO. Unless of course this is leave you plan on taking in transit which makes it different. Literally come to the TMD office and ask us-we are cool as fuck.

navy,34v6wq,new_eyes_open,1 point,Tue May 5 01:11:43 2015 UTC,"Well you don't want to leave the country without having record permission to do so. You could fill out a leave chit including the address in Canada and route it and if it gets approved then you're good to go, otherwise somebody will tell you what else you need to do. ""You probably won't be able to"" is something you'll hear a lot. Sometimes it's true, but don't ever let it stop you from trying anyway. As long as you're not deceptive, the worst that will happen is your request won't get approved. The important thing is once you have an official request in route, you'll get a definite yes or no, not maybe. And make sure it gets routed all the way up to the approving officer. Even if it gets denied along the way, it can still be approved by your CO or whoever gives the ultimate approval."

I declined it in bootcamp so I'm not entirely sure how to switch it but I'd assume its on the ebenefits website as that's where you get your post 9/11 certificate of eligibility.  The rule is 48 months max of VA educational benefits. So you could do 36 months of the post 9/11 and then get a stipend with the reservist post 9/11 if you join the reserves if you really wanted.  But you can't just switch willy nilly

navy,34u649,SCOveterandretired,2,Mon May 4 16:41:57 2015 UTC,Yes you can apply to switch to Post 9/11 GI Bill at any time while on Active Duty or up to 15 years after you separate from Active Duty. There is no requirement to do so on Active Duty.

To qualify for the additional 12 months (after using MGIB) you must either have joined the military prior to 1 Aug 2011 (no other rules for this qualification) or those who joined on/after 1 Aug 11 must meet the rules of a change in the law: if you only have one period of active service you must choose either 36 months of MGIB or 36 months of Post 9/11 GI Bill. If you serve two or more periods of Active duty (reenlisted) you can do the 36 months MGIB then 12 months of Post 9/11 GI Bill (not to exceed 48 total months).  No - you can not use 12 to 24 months of MGIB then use Post 9/11 GI Bill to reach the max. of 48 months - this is per Law. If you use 12 to 24 months MGIB, then apply for Post 9/11 GI Bill, the VA can only award you the remaining months of Post 9/11 GI Bill to reach a total of combined benefits of 36 months. No exceptions to this Law.  No - you can not stop the payments of $100.00 per month for MGIB - there are no provisions in the Law which will allow you to do so. Sorry.   But you are correct in that if you use ALL 36 months of Post 9/11 GI Bill you will be refunded the $1200.00 you paid into MGIB.  But if you use 35 months and 29 days and stop - you will not be refunded this $1200.00. Also you have to be attending at a >50% your final month to receive this refund of $1200.00."
navy,34u649,SCOveterandretired,1 point,Wed May 6 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"Best answer so far, thanks.  One question, what if as the OP said he had 5 months left and decided to apply for the post 9/11 GIBILL.  Would that mean he would get 5 months of the post 9/11 GIBILL?  If so someone should fix that glitch because right now the system is encouraging him to completely exhaust the 5 months, then pay him $1200, and then give him another 12 months of the post 9/11 GIBILL.  Why not just turn in the 5 months for an additional 12."

I'll make it simple, this is the mission statement ""NIOC Texas executes SIGINT and Computer Network Operations at sea, in the air and on the ground-in support of Fleet, theater and national maritime requirements in the USSOUTHCOM and USNORTHCOM AOR.""  SOUTHCOM, not CENTCOM not PACOM. It's a much slower optempo  than any real ""fast paced"" AOR. You have to make sure you're okay with that. Compared to my previous commands in those fast paced AORs, I'm working 1/12th the amount I used to.

navy,34lpte,Hermicane43,3,Sat May 2 07:20:21 2015 UTC,"I am not a reservist, but I have been in Djibouti for a bit so here is my take.   What can I do to keep a good relationship with my loved ones at home?   Each Containerized Living Unit (CLU) has internet in it. Granted, it is roughly $100 a month for 1MB/s speed, it does handle Skype well enough. The time difference does hamper things a bit, but if you and your loved ones can be flexible, you should not have a problem.  You will have one period of 15 days of R&R, not including travel time, meaning you can get maybe 19 days away from Camp at home plus the transit time. You also receive two 96-hour liberty passes, also not including travel. MWR hosts trips to various places including Paris, London, Tanzania, etc. You can meet your family or girlfriend in Paris, if that strikes your fancy.  You can also send and receive mail and packages on Camp with relative ease. You will just have to wait roughly two weeks between shipment and receipt of items. Also, ensure you have packages sent to you FPO/AE; do not write ""Djibouti"" or ""Camp Lemonnier"" on the box, or your stuff will be stuck in Djiboutian customs hell in for quite some time.   How can I put this time to my best use and help get my finances straight?   Your time here will be tax free, and you will receive Hostile Fire/Imminent Danger pay. Don't worry though, this is probably the safest place on the continent. I cannot speak to FSA or BAH, since it looks like you do not have any dependents. There are different programs here for finances; one I can think of off the top of my head is that you can put $10,000 in an account and earn 2.5% a quarter, guaranteed. I am not a finance guy, but there are supposed ""experts"" here on camp that can help you out.  If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask. Oh, and enjoy whatever cold weather you can find while you can, it is amazingly hot here."

How would we separate people with engineering degrees and certifications along with the other college grads from kids straight out of high school?  Military education is not a well rounded education, with the exception of military academies; that's why we have the GI Bill.  I'm not being facetious I legitimately want to know how our Navy feels about the rank system."
navy,34ikck,happybadger,5,Fri May 1 20:44:58 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see a branching of the NCO/SNCO ranks like the Marine Corps has, splitting E-7 (or E-6 in our case) through E-9 into technical and administrative branches. At least with corpsmen I only seem to get really good work information from HM2s, while HM1s and HMCs resign themselves to paperwork. As someone who loves medicine and hates bureaucratic bullshit, that gives me absolutely no motivation to stay enlisted or work to be promoted out of E-4.  The Nurse Corps is just as disheartening. I worked at a naval hospital for a short time where we had a Lt.CDR start in our ward. I, an HN, had to show her, a registered nurse, how to do some of our staple procedures because she hadn't actually done any nursing in like five years. She was taking away work from the corpsmen just to bring herself up to speed and a month into the job still couldn't outpace our HM3s. Having a purely technical officer branch similar to what pilots have seems like it would really attract people who want to do the thing they're good at on a higher level.  Also, the focus on education is really artificial-feeling. I have a BS.c  and two years of med school, but those kids coming out of high school with nothing to their name outpace me in a myriad of ways because the kind of work we do is different from what I was taught. I've known chiefs with two bachelors and a masters who couldn't be dumber or worse at their jobs. Unless your degree specifically applies to the work you do and allows you to function at a higher level than someone without it, I don't see anything gained from the paper worship apart from the knowledge that the sailor can stomach four years of bullshit."
navy,34ikck,justatouchcrazy,3,Sat May 2 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the entire Nurse Corps isn't like that.  If you get speciality training, especially in nurse anesthesia, you can more or less stay at the bedside for an entire 20 year career.  Sure, eventually your collaterals will take you away from patient care a day or two a week, but the Navy is paying a lot of money for you to take care of patients so it typically remains the majority of your job."

navy,34ikck,justatouchcrazy,2,Mon May 4 05:26:20 2015 UTC,"While there isn't a lot untrue in her write up, a decent amount isn't necessarily valid.  A lot of that is to be expected joining the military, such as deployments and having a lot of rules/regulations to follow.  Plus, for the Nurse Corps we don't deploy quite as often as the rest of the fleet.  Also, I don't think I'd say the NC is anti-intellectual; maybe not as diverse as many civilian hospitals but a ton of us have or are getting advanced degrees and many from a variety of known and respected civilian universities.

If you had Security+ CE, paid for the by the Navy, and let it lapse, Navy COOL  will not pay for the cert.   If you had Security+ prior to 2011, you had to go convert to the CE program using COMPTIA's Lifetime to CE method. If you did not get that done during the signup period, then I think Navy COOL rejects the application.  There are other caveats that I can't remember, but they all revolve around either the Navy paying for your first Security+ and you letting it lapse or not going to the CE program and maintaining it that way. The Navy was trying for years to get the CSWF to get at least Security+ done and the hard deadline was like 2 years ago.

While I was at A-school, there were plenty of leaner options available to me, on top of plenty of fresh greens and fruits and the like.  My only advice to you, is to make regular goals, and set new ones as you progress. Your bench press is at a solid 5x 200? Great. Now try 8x 200, or 3x 210. Able to swim 25 yards freestyle at 45sec?

On the other side: These businesses are just plain bad. Many Sailors come from different walks of life where financial ignorance just isn't their fault. The parents' fault, sure but it doesn't matter. You can't blame a good ol' Nebraska 18yo Sailor for not understanding how financially terrible these businesses are. These lenders are trained well on what and what not to say to us. Car dealers are a great example.

I've had men work for me, and worked for men, who were misogynistic. They were few and far between. For the most part I work with a great group of men--and women--who treat me as their sister.   I'm never quite sure how to answer the ""what's it like as a girl..."" question because I wouldn't know what it's like as anything else haha. Being in the navy has its own set of challenges, some that are unique to women, for sure. Gender roles, stereotypes, family planning/pregnancy, dependent wives feeling competitive with you, how do I stay ""girly"" in a community that strips that away, respect, shaving underway, (and periods on a gulf deployment), civilians thinking all we do is kill people or will be a liability ""because you will have PTSD because women are more fragile and can't handle military life."" ... All those are not a daily part of my life. They don't shape how I approach going into work or my interactions with my peers. Occasionally I will run into one of those issues, and that is when I seek out mentors to help me handle difficult situations with grace. ....not really sure where I was going with this....other than those at some challenges I have faced as a female in the navy."

I'm on shore duty which has been perfect for starting a family;  no deployments means my command has been super supportive of my pregnancy. I was a push-button E4 and made E5 off my first exam. Also I was married before I joined and he's been nothing but supportive so far.   That being said, it isn't really the life for me anymore so I will finish out my contract and get out, taking the skills I earned in the Navy with me to the civilian world. I have a degree already but being able to work on one with free TA is an amazing benefit. As is the healthcare.   I'm a CT so my coworkers are all pretty smart (if not always the most common-sensical) and I have never had to deal with the sexism and harassment that many other military women do, so I have been lucky in that regard.

navy,34cv3p,Poopkitty,7,Thu Apr 30 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true. For a newly enlisted sailor, he would get E3 out of basic and an additional 4 points on his promotion exams. Additionally, if he were to start his Masters, any eval rater worth their salt would understand the value of one of their sailors pursuing and succeeding in attaining a graduate's level education. Lastly, he could continue to pursue the OCS route and if he did choose an IDC rating, it could assist him in picking up a commissioning. I do want to highlight that I am not suggesting you enlist with the sole goal of getting picked up - that is a terrible idea and if you aren't ever picked up, you will largely regret your decision.  I'm assuming what Poopkitty meant was that no one will treat you any different, as you are still an enlisted sailor and nothing more. Depending on your leadership, they may expect more from you, but that is largely dependent on your age / motivation / character / etc., and not just your level of formal education."

navy,34cv3p,Poopkitty,4,Thu Apr 30 05:33:13 2015 UTC,"Really tough going E to O unless you put in the 8 years it takes to go LDO. I am finishing up an MBA in finance, came in with a Bachelors and it has been uphill since. No one cares you have a degree, they will not beat your door down to give you a commission once in either. The O side does not like to mix their Koolaid with ours (E's). Only 5% of direct commission officers come from prior service Sailors. Once you put in the time and prove yourself, you'll be too old for the designators that commission the most people (Pilot, NFO). By then you will have dealt with so many poor excuses for leaders who out rank you that it will only make you resent the decision to enlist even more. You have a degree, you rank up on the E side by taking tests. You will pass them easily and rank up fast with your experience. By the time you finally decide to get out, you'll be over 30, wasted your formidable years chasing a commission, probably an E-6 or above, and making too much money to get out and start over at the bottom in the civilian sector. And do not even get me started on quotas for commissioning purpose. Save yourself the hassle and continue to pursue a direct commission while working your way up as a civilian. With that all being said being enlisted is easy, pay is great for the job you do, and there's something to be said about watching a sunrise/sunset from the deck of the USS GW cruising over the Marianas Trench.

Get back to work.  I enlisted for a couple reasons, but for the sake of this, I wanted to switch career paths and check out medicine. Didn't know if I wanted to be a doctor, PA, or nurse, and since I had already made the stupid mistake of getting  a degree in a profession I hate, might as well get some experience with those level providers and see what I like. I love being a corpsman. I can balance out the bullshit because I adore my job and am constantly learning and becoming a better corpsman. There isn't a day that I don't learn something new.  But it sucks being told where to live, being treated like the 18 year olds you work with. EMBRACE THE SUCK. It'll help you work towards getting promoted quicker. It'll help drive you to get your quals, prove everyone wrong, and promote.  Would I do it all again? I'd have chosen a different career path, but I'd totally join the navy again; even enlist. Experiences may vary. Hope that helps.  Edit: And I work with 2 other HMs with Bachelors just in my department. There are enlisted with bachelors everywhere.

The March Board has just recently convened and results were released. May I ask your stats?

navy,34cv3p,bc87m,4,Thu Apr 30 03:41:14 2015 UTC,"OSA? I thought civilians used an Officer Recruiter (OR).   First and foremost, I'd educate yourself on things regarding OCS boards. There are bad recruiters out there. I don't know if yours is bad, but it seems confusing that you aren't really sure what designator - given that you have to apply for 1-3 with your package. Check this site for FY Board dates: http://www.public.navy.mil/BUPERS-NPC/CAREER/CAREERCOUNSELING/Pages/CommissioningPrograms.aspx.  So you should have selected three designators and your OR should have said the results were - PRO REC Y / PRO REC N / PRO REC X for each of the designators you applied (max of three). If you didn't get that information, something seems a bit fishy.  Additionally, are you sure your stats are competitive? Without your stats, here is a general rule of thumb for the IDC regarding competitive stats.  OAR - 50+ is considered competitive  Degree / GPA - 3.3+ and a degree relating to Intelligence (Poli Sci / Int relations) or a STEM degree is preferred.  Experience- IC community experience is positive. Leadership experience is a positive.  LORs- Letters from IDC Officers is a positive.   Interviews- Interviews with IDC Officers in the designators of which you are applying. Shoot for O5+."

navy,34cv3p,bc87m,1 point,Fri May 1 20:24:01 2015 UTC,"Here was how I went about it:  I compiled my package components on my own and saved my Officer Interviews and CO Interviews for the end. Give these two portions at least a 1-2 month buffer from submission date, as your CO and Officers administering the interviews will likely have busy schedules. You should be working with a CCC while putting together the package, if for some reason your CCC is of no help, find a reliable and dedicated Senior NCO (E7-E9) to assist you. Once you are ready to schedule these interviews, broach the subject with your Senior NCO and ask if he could assist in scheduling your Officer Interviews and CO Interview. Explain that O5+ Interviews are competitive and have suggestions ready regarding whom will conduct the interview. If he is a competent leader, he will assist you in scheduling all of this and you will have gone about it the correct way. If for some reason he fails you, that's why you have a 1-2 month buffer. Speak with another SNCO and explain to them the process.   Hope this helps. It sounds like a more difficult process than it is, but you will do a lot of waiting."

navy,34a1yi,Minista_Pinky,2,Wed Apr 29 16:00:15 2015 UTC,Ah my mistake.
navy,34a1yi,LeBitchTits,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:30:24 2015 UTC,"Translated:   Some time ago began to hypothesize acquisition of French logistics multipurpose ship ""Siroco"", which at an early stage  have contact with the opposition of the Army and Air Force  during the discussion of the Military Program Law by military leaders.  This ship  will be on sale for 80 million euros  ( new cost € 400 million ), with whom the effect that the siroccoacquisition will lead to the sale of two of the five frigates of the Navy, its deactivation or not the upgrade to the end of life useful. The lack of a vessel of this type is considered a  critical gap  in terms of forces projection capability by the military leadership, with a cost of 22,000 euros day.  Having secured the consensus on  Defense Committee on the operational importance of this medium and the unique opportunity  of acquisition,  was decided on the eve of the visit of the French Prime Minister to Portugal, pursued negotiations with France .  Following this process,  the Minister of National Defense (MDN), determined that :  The DGRDN, in conjunction with the EMGFA and the Navy, start formal negotiations with the French Ministry of Defence to define the conditions for a possible acquisition of Siroco, namely: the final purchase price and the inherent payment plan; means, weaponry, equipment and lots of spare that will be provided to the ship; the condition of the state in which the ship will be delivered including maintenance actions to be carried out prior to the transfer; issues related to the identification of detail and trim training; other technical aspects relating to the maintenance and support of the ship; and any warranty terms; The EMGFA, in conjunction with the Navy, submit to MDN until May 5, a study on the impact of the integration of an LPD in the Navy in terms of Personnel expenditure aggregates, Operation and Maintenance and Investment, considering the defined guidelines politically to be progressively achieved by 2020; The DGRDN, in conjunction with the EMGFA and the Navy, present proposal for a possible acquisition based on negotiated conditions, covering identification of possible sources of funding. II  Turning now to another gap which was felt in the Navy, the naval units of the type coastal patrol. These units are designed to operate along the coastal areas in surveillance, patrol and defense . There are patrols aimed for naval combat, and others that are primarily designed to exercise state authority functions and perform public functions. The Navy are geared to safety functions and authority of the state and public interest missions.  As  we had mentioned earlier , four patrols were acquired  STANFLEX 300  the Kingdom of Denmark, due to its "" seaworthiness characteristics suitable for operation in areas under national maritime jurisdiction, especially for coastal operation and contains a residual life of at least 10 years, and require low maintenance costs of the hull and deck equipment and systems, as well as being a job opportunity for the domestic industry . ""  In this context, it was recently increased the effective of the Portuguese Navy  four new naval units of the coastal patrol type  (Tejo class), the Douro NRP, NRP Mondego, Tagus and the NRP NRP Guadiana. It was also  defined his crew  : 3 officers, 4 sergeants and 16 squares (23). This represents a decrease compared to the class  Cacine  which had  three officers, six sergeants and 24 squares (33) .  III  To end I once again remind you that we are a country with one of the largest exclusive economic zones of Europe, with a maritime area of over 1.7 million km 2 , corresponding to about 18 times its land area.  Moreover, the continental shelf, in accordance with the proposal submitted to the United Nations, will significantly increase the maritime area under national sovereignty or jurisdiction. This increase will begin to be  discussed at the United Nations from 2016 ,  with the Kingdom of Spain recently removed the objections raised in this regard .  In addition, due to the geographical location of our country, we are immersed in a context of threats to which we must have adequate capacity to respond. Hence the unquestionable importance of the Navy and its contribution to national security, because besides the military defense, plays a major role in other areas such as deterrence and detection of actions related to marine pollution, terrorism, arms trafficking, drugs and human beings, illegal immigration, piracy, illegal taking of fish and exploitation of natural resources.  As a final shot to the less attentive, the name logistically multipurpose vessel (Siroco) that is sought is associated with a hot, stuffy and dusty wind blowing in the Mediterranean, from North Africa, originating in desert Sara, and that appears during spring and summer.  It's just on the back of this wind that ride many of the components of such threats frame.  JMFerreira"

navy,347s2o,cknight18,18,Tue Apr 28 23:50:48 2015 UTC,"odds are your BAH will not go through, however, you might be able to recoup back pay - depending on the PSD.  you may want to move your things into a storage unit then you would have ground to collect the BAH while deployed - please talk to someone at your command before doing this though, dont want you out a bunch of money and them not pay you.  im sure others will answer your other questions directly (USNS is a relief ship - much diff mission than Nimitz)  deployment wise: bring no more than 2 sets of civilian clothes, at least one pair (probably more) of gym wear, because that ends up being a lot of what you do while transiting.  You are typically afforded very little space so things like extra boots, tons of redbull, whatever wont have a home.  Really consider if you need every little thing before packing it with you - otherwise they may end up in a seabag in some storage locker.  A few pro-tips:   bring your own hotsauce....like....a big bottle.  this will assure you have some flavor on the same foods you will eat over and over. same concept: i like bringing a couple things of peanut butter (crunchy of course) for nights you just wanna grab a pb&j (bread + jelly usually on mess decks) dont bring too much crap - you will lose it, break it, or it will take up space you dont have. get yourself a nintendo 3DS, PSvita, or something similar.  Even if you arent into video games, you'd be surprised how handy it will come when you start feeling like youre going to lose your mind from boredom. An electric razor may help shave a few minutes off your morning routine and get you into the chow line before the masses.  Seperately, buy EXTRA cartridges for your regular razor - ship's store will run out. GO BUY NEW SOCKS NOW, you will be living in boots for the next X number of months...go get some nice, comfy, socks before you are in the middle of the drink with nothing but holey socks. Snag some of those laundry pods, they are awesome. if you are a body hair shaver - dont forget to bring your trimmer.  4 months is a lot of bush. if you have to wonder if you are missing a part of ANY uniform, check, double check it, and go buy some extra shit (like a neckerchief or white hat).  People steal uniforms, a lot, but you dont wanna get stuck without something you need to be able to go out - fucking vietnam. Make sure you buy extra toiletries like deoderant and toothpaste; you dont want to run out. if you have any recurring medical problems (ie, horrible foot odor, recurring rash, cold sores, etc) go buy whatever OTC cure you need for it.   dont get caught off guard - again, ship's store doesnt carry much. get qualified in something if the option is there!!! big bonus for your career plus it gives you something to occupy your time. dont get sloppy drunk 10 min into every port, at least on the first day.  MWR has tons of great tours, etc available, take AT LEAST one day and actually visit the countries youre in. CHOOSE YOUR LIBERTY BUDDY WISELY.  Fact: you will go down with a bad liberty buddy.  ive seen too many good sailors take the fall because they let a bad liberty buddy ruin their deployment on the first port. DONT SPEND ALL YOUR DAMN MONEY, but do go have fun.  Make sure you dont come back any poorer(sp?) than you already are.  We dont make a lot, but deployments should be a huge payday."
navy,347s2o,I_jus_lurk_here,6,Wed Apr 29 01:17:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Will definitely take a lot of this in mind.    Is a laptop a bad idea, then? I am into gaming so I'm just wondering whether or not a laptop would be ok vs a handheld. I'd like to believe I could get away with an electric razor, but I just grow hair too damn quick for that to be enough.  Not too worried about getting too drunk on my port visits, I don't drink often. Thanks for the advice about the liberty buddy, though! Again about money, not too worried. I've paid for my car in cash, invisalign braces in cash, and paid off a significant amount of my student loans and still have a good chuck to fall back on. Saving is earning!   Some other questions?   Does the ship generally have reliable internet, good enough to skype home? Should I be expecting some type of extra pay (besides just sea pay)?

navy,347s2o,TheBeneGesseritWitch,5,Wed Apr 29 01:46:55 2015 UTC,"Does the ship generally have reliable internet   No.   No ship has internet that is for personal use, although sometimes when they pull into port they'll hook up a wifi (this is common in 7th fleet, but that's funded by MWR, just so you know). It'll be the same as using your work computer, but it'll be on the ship's network. This means no hooking up your personal devices, no skype, no facetime, and depending on the ship, no facebook or reddit. You're in the middle of the ocean, so at best, you're going to get spotty connection. It can take minutes for a facebook picture with pages to load.

IA pay, not sure about, but on top of sea-pay you wont be getting any extra pay allowance unless you are in a designated combat or hazard zone.  also: to reiterate what was said below....because it's that important: go buy like 5-6 pairs of shower shoes and count yourself lucky if you feel like you have too many.

navy,347s2o,pilotman996,3,Fri May 1 01:06:15 2015 UTC,"My husband is currently deployed on the USNS Comfort, so I'll try to give some pointers as to what he was told to bring and what he's experienced so far.   Does the ship generally have reliable internet, good enough to skype home?   Noooo. Internet goes down all the time. We're lucky if we get a solid connection to FB Chat with each other. Apparently the ship's phones tend to go down, too. Late at night when he's on night shift, though, when there aren't as many people online he says he's been able to get on YouTube and Reddit, for what it's worth. But middle of the day? Not a chance.  The power/lights in general goes out on the ship, too. Before deploying he was told to get a flashlight he can attach to his belt and/or dogtags in case the lights go out and you're stuck in a random hallway.   Anything I should definitely bring/not bring? I'm not sure how much space will be alotted to me, so I don't know if for instance 2 big things of protein powder and preworkout, or a laptop Should be taken.    Don't bring a hard-sided suitcase. No where to put it when it's empty. Just pack your seabag or other duffle bags. Like others have said, try to pack ""light"" as in don't bring a whole lot of unnecessary stuff because space is limited. I don't know what your living arrangements will be like, but my husband is an officer and got one garment-sized locker, two half-lockers and three drawers to put all his stuff in. Not a whole lot of space. As for the protein powder, that's your call. My husband brought individual packets of the stuff he uses so it wouldn't be as bulky as the big containers and the packets can be stuffed just about anywhere for storage purposes. That being said, extras of toiletries are always good, bring laundry detergent pods, those are lifesavers; you definitely don't want to run out. So far, it's taken about a month for anything from the U.S. to get to him, so keep that in mind if you're going to be asking friends/family/loved ones for extra stuff.  My husband did bring a tablet and his portable PS4 system, however, because he has his priorities (lol). But he also has a way to secure them in his locker (which obviously you need to bring your own locks). He says he'd be lost without them when the internet goes down. Invest in bug spray. Especially the heavy duty kind that you can pre-treat your uniform with that should last about 4 weeks. I'm only assuming where you're going, but I'm pretty sure you're going to need it (and they may even provide you with some on the ship--they did on the Comfort, but my husband went ahead and got his own at a sporting goods store so he could have some when he really needed it). Also invest in some anti-chafing lotions/powders/sticks. You will NEED it. Where you're going it's going to be muggy and you'll be sweating in places you didn't even know you could sweat. That, plus wearing your NWU's 12+ hours a day, and you won't be a happy camper. Bring a Camelpak type water-backpack thing. Husband said he would have died without his and it even came in handy on board the ship going up and down all the stairs and whatnot when they were loading supplies on board.   I could probably go on and on, but I'll stop there. Hopefully you'll get a welcome packet soon which will give you more information on the do's and don'ts. Feel free to ask any more questions, though, I'd be happy to answer as best I can! Fair winds and following seas!  Edit: Formatting and added a couple bullets"

Despite reports in some media, there are no Americans on board, according to a U.S. official.   Then, the article says that the Tigris is a Marshal Islands flagged vessel.   Also, what's interesting is the admiralty law aspect of this whole case. It's pretty common to arrest a ship when a claim is made against a ship owner or possessor. I wonder what type of claim can be made against the shipping company and the owner/possessor. Maybe their's some type of piracy claim allowing the ship to be arrested with force?"

navy,344afk,BurningBushes2000,11,Tue Apr 28 14:34:48 2015 UTC,Apparently if you plug in my social to the system all of my past medical history appeared.. I saw it all. It's because my family is prior military and  I was under their healthcare.
navy,344afk,Warbond,2,Tue Apr 28 10:56:15 2015 UTC,"As someone who works in recruit medicine (Corpsman), yeah if you're a military brat then the second you get P-days/in-processing, we can see every single thing you've ever been seen for and every medication you've ever been on.   I've seen dozens of Marine recruits in Receiving who show up to medical because they haven't slept for a few days and are feeling crappy, or they get sent in by their DIs because they got a case of vasculitis, or they're a week into training and their recruit crud hasn't gone away yet, etc. And then when I pull up their previous history all of a sudden I see dozens of visits for asthma/ADHD/mental health stuff/various other disqualifying conditions.  At that point there's no use denying it, though most people still do, even when I pull them aside and tell them ""listen man, you're in the military medical system, I can see every single fucking thing you've ever been seen for. Don't lie to me,"" etc, they still try to bullshit me and the MO.  You probably would have been better off admitting it (at MEPS) since your parents were prior military, and applying for a waiver."

navy,344afk,Tymanthius,3,Tue Apr 28 15:56:01 2015 UTC,To everyone who thinks that it was cause his parents had military health care and it was a violation of HIPAA it isn't. When you go for your background investigation for your clearance you sign a paper saying the investigations office can have all your medical records. Read what you sign next time because apparently no one thinks that they check.
navy,344afk,deaddebate,2,Tue Apr 28 16:01:19 2015 UTC,But what about those recruits who have regular civilian doctors? They can't find out anything about their medical history.
navy,344afk,CTNope,3,Mon May 11 02:57:27 2015 UTC,"Once again. Yes they can. The background investigators take the form you signed called the ""Medical Record Certification for Release"" and take it to the doctors office."
navy,344afk,CTNope,3,Mon May 11 05:13:12 2015 UTC,"There's an issue with this... They can request them, but it's a lot more intensive/more work.   Also they actually have to find said doctor/records you went to. People seemingly believe that all your information is just in some record... (All of your information over your entire life I mean. Which there is not.)  It's not. Most ways they track people is through credit history, then criminal history. After that it gets harder... The one way they can is track via your HMO... If you have one. However how does someone figure out which one a person used?   Now this isn't impossible, but it is a PITA, and there are certain caveats/laws to it."
navy,344afk,Charlestonian,2,Mon May 11 11:21:31 2015 UTC,yes they can. If nothing else the state would store any records on prescribed controlled substances. Most ADD meds fall into those categories. Do they usually bother to track down your doctor? No it's hard work and unless they have reason they won't. Can they very easily see if you were proscribed controlled substances? Yep.
navy,344afk,RedditHokage,2,Mon May 11 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"Good for you. Glad you are doing well.  And I'm glad you volunteered, even if you got turned down.   Better than SO many out there."
navy,344afk,jpkoushel,3,Mon May 11 21:06:43 2015 UTC,"3 things:   I'm very glad you had a positive outcome and grew from your experience.  People cannot be defined by a single action or trait.  We are better than our worst moments and worse than our best moments.  Your life is larger than these few months.  Many people fail in critical moments but you prove you are made of tougher stuff.  I hope you have a successful and fulfilling career. Waivers exist for these conditions.  If you had been honest, you could have requested and undergone a much more comprehensive consideration rather than the reactionary, negative determination because you lied. Your life-lesson was not free.  You cost the US DOD tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of man-hours. The recruiter, MEPS, instructors, medical staff, and command staff all did their jobs correctly.  Standards exist for a reason, whether you agree with them or not.  That time, effort, and money could have been spent on someone who actually stayed in the service and contributed to the mission you failed to reach due to your own dishonesty."
navy,344afk,Bircher,3,Mon May 11 19:46:55 2015 UTC,"They also will not admit people with heart conditions, asthma, or hearing impairment. The problem with psychological conditions is that they are not black and white diagnoses. For years doctors have been over prescribing medication, and it's come back to bite a lot of people in the ass when they want to serve. The only thing the military can objectively see in someone's record is that this person's psychological problems are severe enough to be prescribed medication, and that's where they've drawn the line.  Do people change? Do people get better? Sure they do, that's why they have a waiver system. Is the waiver system always fair? No, but it's doesn't close the door completely. The bigger problem is Navy draw downs mean it's not worth spending time getting waivers for a lot of recruiters. Things may change with a big war.  As far as ASVAB scores go, the test is used for one thing, and one thing only -- to place people in jobs. Don't be so quick to put people down just because they score low. Checking IDs or watching people piss all day doesn't require you to be good at math. The Navy cares more about someone who is able to focus for a 12 hour watch."

navy,344sg1,Suncovery,7,Tue Apr 28 08:23:55 2015 UTC,"What /u/poopkitty said, but also:  The yen to dollar ratio is changing. When I first got to Japan, it was about ¥60 : $1 My COLA was about the same as my base pay. Now, per EAGLE 810 Radio on my drive into work this morning, it is ¥118 : $1.   So the cost of everything in town is the same, but the amount of yen you can purchase has changed.  Let me break it down like this: a meal at your favorite restaurant costs ¥1500. If you buy it with dollars, it's, right now, going to cost you $12.60. Several years ago, that meal would have cost you ~$25. A few months ago, when it was ¥100 : $1, it would cost you $15.

Was this a 'I'm on the 3 day on team and I've only been on 2 days but they didn't schedule me so screw it' moment, or a legitimate 'Its my scheduled off day and the schedule is right' moment?  Either way, why did you go in if you didn't think you had to be there? I doubt you had a gut check suddenly at 3 in the morning. You had to have set your alarm to get up so early on a Sunday (unless you're crazy different from 99% of the population) so you obviously felt like this could be an issue the night before. Why didn't you text or call the first, Chief, or anyone else the night before?  Like I said, could be missing something, but this seems like a HUGE case of there's-a-whole-other-side-to-this-story."

If it's your DUTY day you muster, even if you do not have watch. Duty section turn over and watch turn over are completely different OP.   Some important info is missing from this post."
navy,342gmq,oldelkgrove,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"Well, (it is clear to me now)  but the way this section operates is either you have duty Friday, and the whole weekend, or not at all.   Sounds much easier when conveyed that way, the way they try to explain it is Three off, two on, two off,  (I still can't get that pattern quite right. )   The confusing bit is that we've got more than enough people in the section, so it would be unreasonable to have an excessive amount of people standing at the gate.  So even though your section may be scheduled for the day, you may not have to stand a watch.  But obviously you're expected to stay within the area (in case they need you)    This to me just seems like things that you just have to get used too.  I am typically a day worker, with a set schedule and watch that can be written weeks in advance, somewhat follows a pattern and is always on the base that I live on.    This schedule here (on ASF)  They make the watchbill for the next day, on what ever day you're working.   (So the Tuesday watchbill comes out Monday after work)      Let's be real here, if you're not scheduled for watch, last thing you do is ask about it.   I went in just to cover myself, just in case."

The watch turns over at 0500,  and they have us arrive at 0400.  I was armed up by 0415, and stood at quarters.  Mission Accomplished, even though I was setup to fail?   I'm not really known as the guy to be late,  but the fact that they tried to tell my command's MA1 ASF/Urinalysis Coordinator, that I showed up at 0900?!

navy,3403pb,Zwilt,14,Mon Apr 27 06:06:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't been in the Navy for almost 20 years, but I was once a Nuke Electrician.  The job, on the surface, is very cool.  You operate/maintain/support a nuclear reactor inside a steel tube hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean.  That's cool, and its not the easiest thing to do, so there is a sense of pride in being a Nuke in general.  Now that that's out of the way, let's take a good look at the shit sandwich that's left.  2 a.m. - That's the time you'll be waking up to get yourself down to the boat to perform a 3 a.m. reactor start-up for the 8 a.m. underway.  The best part is knowing that the coners are still in their bunks for another few hours sleeping off the alcohol they consumed at that party for their last night in port.  Which you didn't go to, because you have a 2 a.m. wake up.  2 p.m - That's the time you'll be getting off the boat after you've pulled into port at 10 a.m. to help shut the reactor down. The best part is getting to watch the coners leave at 10:05 a.m.  They'd leave at 10 a.m., but it takes a few minutes to get the gangplank over to the boat...you know.  Logs - You're going to take a few.  During start-up.  Then you're going to take a WHOLE. BUNCH. MORE.  Every sensor on every piece of equipment that has a read-out will be read, and logged, every hour, every day, the entire trip.  And for a nuclear reactor, there's a lot of sensors.  Luckily, going through Nuke school will make your pen hand strong.  Pretty sure I still have a callus there.  Heat - Dozens of feet of steam piping will make your workspace quite uncomfortable underway.  There are air ducts with cool air coming out of them, and there's Maneuvering which is thankfully void of steam piping, but that's where all the First Classes and Chiefs will be.  You, however, will be leaning over 12000° steam piping, most likely taking logs.  ORSE - An ORSE is an ORSE, of course, of course.  It's also an ass ream of an exam.  The first part of which requires you to regurgitate all the shit you learned in Nuke school years back that you haven't used since you left there.  Quickly, name all the stresses that the external wall of the nuclear reactor will undergo, at power and shutdown, what causes them, what will increase those stresses, and the safeguards in place to minimize those stresses.  That's the only question on that one page.  The rest of the page is blank to allow you room to draw all the equations and charts and bullshit you gotta come up with.  We used to say how nice multiple choice tests are. They're nice because they're easy.  They're easy because the answer is given to you on that page, and you just have a recognize it as the answer.  No multiple choice questions on this exam.  Essay-style only.  They like Nukes to write shit, apparently.  The second part of the exam is the operational portion, where all the examiners watch you while you're on watch and ensure you walk, talk, and take a shit correctly while at your watchstation.  You're pretty much in robot mode at this point, while the examiner is breathing down your neck, asking you why you scratched your ass at that particular time, since 'scratching your ass' is not listed as one of the steps in the operation procedure.... Yeah, it's a great time... Just don't scratch your ass.  Radiation - Now, don't get me wrong here.  Naval nuclear reactors are some of the safest on the planet, thanks to the yearly ass ream of an ORSE that ensures we all know our shit.  And honestly, the actual day-to-day radiation you're exposed to is minimal; you'll probably pick up more radiation in a few cross-country flights than you will during your tenure on the boat.  That is, UNLESS YOU'RE A NUKE, and they got you in a banana suit in the reactor compartment while the reactor's shutdown so you can dry-hump the reactor wall to remove a few grams of contamination.  Then you're going to pick up a few more rads, lucky you.  But don't worry, your genitalia will stop glowing before you need to use it again.  Maybe.  - OK, I'm kidding, your junk will not glow, no matter how much Navy radiation you pump it full of.  Your junk would fall off first.  - OK, OK, still kidding, your junk will stay intact obviously, but it will, of course, be rendered useless as your nuts are baked into oblivion. - YES... I'm still kidding.   BUT THE REST OF IT IS TRUE."

navy,3403pb,TitoMPG,7,Mon Apr 27 13:33:25 2015 UTC,"NPTU student here. It's not impossible, but communication can be a stressor on the relationship.  You won't be allowed to have your phone with you for most of the day, so even during breaks, you're not talking to your SO. And she says she understands, but does she really? You get back to your barracks at 2315 with a massive headache that comes from a rough PT session followed by five hours of cramming and trying to get three IAs in one night, and you have two missed calls, seven snapchats, a text message that's longer than the AC Theory chapter of your A School notes, and a voicemail saying ""I feel like you never want to talk to me, ImpedanceIsFutile."" And as soon as she sees that you've opened her snapchats, she calls you, because she's been waiting all day to talk to her man. She wants to know what you thought of the long text she didn't give you a chance to read. For god knows what reason, you don't dump her aspiring dependa ass right there on the spot.  She drives 7 hours to Charleston for your Power School graduation, and she won't leave you the fuck alone while you're moving all the shit from your barracks to your car. You find out that she's been parked in front of the Mini NEX for two hours, so you cave and go say hi to her. She doesn't understand what ""grad and go"" means, nor does she have any interest in hearing why you really need to finish packing your shit now so we can hang out tomorrow. All she cares about is how she drove seven goddamn hours to come see me and I'm acting like I don't want to see her. Again, for reasons unknown, you don't dump her aspiring dependa ass right there on the spot.  You report to NPTU Ballston Spa a week later, you go on hold with a section that's about to go on mids, and now you and your girlfriend aren't even awake at the same time. This just makes her even more clingy. If you ever tell her you feel like she doesn't understand how busy you are, she reminds you that her stepdad is a Warrant Officer and he's busy too but he still makes time to argue with her mom. Then you realize that she doesn't care about how she makes you feel, so you finally dump her aspiring dependa ass right there on the spot. You block her on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Google Plus, Skype, and even fucking RallyPoint, and you make a solemn vow to never use OkCupid again.  But if your SO understands the time constraints and effects of long distance, more power to ya."

It really depends on your gpa as to how many hours you are required to put in and all that jazz. Power school is more annoying than it is difficult, you'll get through it fine. Make sure your priorities are in order, don't sacrifice your family and friends for school, but don't fail out of school either. Your boat will consume your life when you get there.

navy,3403pb,ithrowelevens,8,Mon Apr 27 11:13:17 2015 UTC,"Well, usually I avoid these kinds of questions, but I am feeling that I am in an informative mood.  If you are asking this, then it seems to be that you are joining the Navy and wanting to know what you are getting yourself in to.  Being a ""Navy Nuke"" is nothing like what you can expect.  One thing that surprises me is that I failed to have the idea to consider finding out about this job before I committed to it.  All I saw was that this was going to get me out of a financial burden that I incurred.  I didn't think about what I would be doing or acknowledge what anyone told me.  I just saw the dollar signs.  To be fair, I did achieve my goal of financial independence by going into the nuclear field faster than I would have in any other realistic method.  The job is difficult.  Depending on your background, the training pipeline could be a cakewalk or could incur a 100 hour work week.  The funny thing is, you observe this 100 hour work week others are enduring, and you feel like you are glad this could never happen to you.  You are smart, and hard working, and you will do what you have to do to get by and make a good life.  Then you get to your boat.  You find out that 100 hour work week is the norm.  The whole system is bogged down by so much administrative burden that you can take 2 hours of work and spread that out over an 8 hour day.  Even if you do everything you are supposed to do, you have to depend on other people to get your work done, so you could still be spending many unnecessary hours on board.  One thing I have observed is people joining the Navy straight out of high school, or at least never having worked a real job.  They see the bullshit you go through everyday, and they say they have to get out. They can't handle a 3 hour ""field day"" every week.  They don't realize that there is bullshit in every job.  If the Navy could orchestrate a way to keep the worthwhile people and get rid of the people riding out their time to get a retirement then it would make things much better.  The problem is that the ""nukes"" find similar work outside that does not require duty days or underways (time spent away from and out of communication with your family) and the work outside also pay more.  If the Navy bothered to reward people that deserve it and kept them around rather than promoting the people who don't know what they are doing and know how to play the game, then everything would get better.  Sorry if this is going too far in depth, just PM me if you have questions.  The Navy can be very rewarding, but the long term plan is questionable."

This kid would sit in his cube all day and whine when no one came and got him.   You want to do well? Be proactive, learn to talk to people, and don't wilt/cry/run when told your stupid, lacking, or a failure. We all get told that, we all fail to be the best, but the best nukes just take it and move on and get better.  It's not a job for sensitive people.

There's the OMPF on BOL, NDAWS, and the less official NSIPS, ETJ and FLTMPS lists. Here's the rub. They may not agree with each other. I have an Army commendation, 5 NAMs and a CAR among many other ribbons. But those 5 are the big ones that are always in question. The CAR and ARCOM show up everywhere but I show anywhere from 3 to 5 NAMS on the other sites. Two sites show duplicates. I have the originals of everything. I will end by saying that if you have justification to wear a ribbon or medal, ie a signed 3591 for your weapons qualifications, any certificate received that shows you can wear something like a Battle E etc, if you can prove you are entitled to wear it then just wear it. Even if you try to get your record straightened out (I've resubmitted all my personal awards on 4 separate occasions) it may never get truly fixed. Just keep originals."

navy,340bz3,TakaKe,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:26:23 2015 UTC,"I wear whatever I have documentation for (like the message that said my ship earned a battle E, copies of my NAMs, etc), and screw whatever the official records show. I've been trying to get them updated for years, and just when I did, I went and got married and now nothing shows up under my maiden OR married name."
navy,340bz3,TheBeneGesseritWitch,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:33:33 2015 UTC,"I never signed for my gwot ribbon and got chewed out for not wearing it so now I wear it, no one said shit because it's a gimme after 90 days when I transfer to my next command they're not going to question whether a second class earned that ribbon or not. Just look up the requirements for a ribbon talk to your lpo and verify that you filled the requirements. If your fuzzy on stuff like NAMs don't wear it unless you were awarded it personally, but that's obvious."
navy,340bz3,daboobiesnatcher,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:34:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, lots of misinformation here.  NSIPS does not give you the authority to wear anything.  Let me say that again.  NSIPS doesn't mean shit when it comes to the decorations you're authorized to wear.  If your CO gives you a spot NAM and you turn around and search your NSIPS, guess what?  It's not going to be in there.  According to a lot of sea lawyers in this thread, that means you can't wear it.  And that is silly.    Bottom line:  NSIPS describes, it does not prescribe."

navy,340bz3,nightim3,-5,Mon Apr 27 22:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'm an E1 at my first duty station, so take my advice with a grain of salt.  Research ribbons and find their requirements. For example, I'm stationed in an overseas duty station so I am eligible for the Oversea Service ribbon. HOWEVER, the stipulation is that I get this ribbon after being here for a year. I've only been here a month and a half. So you may qualify for the ribbons but didn't meet the stipulation for earning it.  Just ask a YN or someone who you know is in charge of that shit. My roommate works in HR, so I always just ask him."

Like, commands have their own chain but there are also people above that command's commanding officer.""  You neglected to answer the question. Just say 'yes'.
