circlejerkaustralia,3db484,Whytiederp,14,Tue Jul 14 22:14:51 2015 UTC,"It's important to realise that this is just one very visible datapoint in a vast ocean of shit.  Arbitrary bannings and content removals happen every. day. on r/Australia.  Most people just walk away, never to return.  Some bite back at what they see as bullying by a small subset of chronically bullying moderators, and are labelled as bullies in return.  It's a ludicrous situation, and it all stems from the design flaws of reddit.  Reddit is based strongly on the ancient IRC system - in its heyday, anyone could create a channel on an IRC server and become a tinpot god.  The moderation dramas that ensued were precisely what happens here, and the more people a channel could attract the more vicious the moderation drama.  An IRC creator/moderator could feel justified in whatever petty power they had, because attracting a self-sustaining audience to a new IRC channel was a difficult job.  Without a userbase an IRC channel/newsgroup/blog/subreddit is just an empty clubhouse.  Moderators do not build a community.  Other community members build it, comment by comment, submission by submission.  When a moderator chooses to remove content or to punish someone by banning, they're claiming ownership of the effort that you put in to the content you post.  Smart moderators understand this, and really do act like the fabled 'janitor' role some moderators claim they perform.  They're there to guide the community along, not to police it.  Not to control the flow of content.  Not to punish people for arbitrarily-created law infractions.  Not to hide away in their modmail cloister, rambling semi-coherently to their brethren about how nasty the users are and how they should be showing more respect to their betters.  This is doubly galling in subreddits that exist purely because of their name, ones like r/Australia which attract their audience solely by having a name that a newbie can whack an /r/ onto.  This mess will go on forever, because it's designed to go on forever.  New users will continue to be tricked into spending large amounts of their time to create content to entertain their community-mates, only to eventually run up against a moderator who is displeased with one of their offerings.  That user will then either take the abuse, or they will not. Will go elsewhere, or end up here, or else become a bitter, enraged idealist.  There's a way past all of this.  r/Australia moderators need to give up some of their powers.  r/Australia needs a metareddit where all removals and bans are posted.  Community members need to be able to discuss what happens behind the scenes.  Publicly, openly.  If dredd's 'volunteers' keep getting abused, it's because the abusers are forced to plead their cases alone, in modmail, in secret, at the whim of whatever moderator takes an interest at the time.  It's a system designed to be abused by both sides.  After reading that modmail dump, I'm more convinced than ever that qg and dredd want that system to continue just the way it is.  They like the abuse, because ignoring it validates their power.  Thank you for posting this."
circlejerkaustralia,3db484,ArchiveLibrarian,7,Wed Jul 15 01:19:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. Unfortunately I don't think this will never happen without a drastic mod team change. When the most active mod's prime focus is regularly extending rules, deleting posts, banning users and trying to figure out alt accounts you have a fundamental problem. As evidenced by this modmail you can see that he believes his word is final, and he answers only to qg. It took 4 people against him for him to achieve anything, and even then he pushed it back onto those users as CJA mods instead of addressing the ban.  /r/australia needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, starting with a new set of simplified rules that can be objectively enforced. 'Trolling' should be decided by votes. At the moment /r/australia's rules are absurd compared to other subs.  Sadly, although the head honcho won't realise this- most CJA users are pretty passionate about /r/australia. If you wanted advice on how to improve a subreddit CJA would be a pretty good place to seek it."
circlejerkaustralia,3db484,The_Gherkin_Jerk,6,Wed Jul 15 01:45:54 2015 UTC,"The thing about the bannings and content removal is that most users there have no idea what is going on, I didn't until I got a ban and looked closer at what was going on.    They're there to guide the community along, not to police it.   You get it.   This is doubly galling in subreddits that exist purely because of their name, ones like r/Australia[2] which attract their audience solely by having a name that a newbie can whack an /r/ onto.   That is what shits me, new people have no idea and I doubt no one new on reddit will search makesyoumoist to find out about the AU moderation.    r/Australia[4] needs a metareddit where all removals and bans are posted. Community members need to be able to discuss what happens behind the scenes. Publicly, openly. If dredd's 'volunteers' keep getting abused, it's because the abusers are forced to plead their cases alone, in modmail, in secret.   I'll be honest, I never abused or had words with an AU mod until I got a ban, when I was given one without a polite warning I cracked the shits at them. I just Aussies to be free to discuss Aussie things but when mods have an agenda and yes bully others they can go and get fucked.   Great post AL."

It's a gimmick by mods to stir up user hatred - yes - exactly like SRS.  What matters is that we are part of the reddit community and held in high regard and maintain the efforts for a better world.  Dredds policies have destroyed /r/Australia's reputation, thrown us back into the dark ages and are sociopathic, borderline psychopathic brutal displays of self serving hatred which serve no other purpose than to isolate /r/Australia in an us against them game which can only be described as also coming from the SRS play book.  But continue to try and make those who have tried to do the right thing as weak and insipid and those who are brutal dictators, with absolutely no care for society, who are utilitarians and SJWs with no other care other than stirring up hatred to solidify their dictatorial popsition as being strong and noble.

As an aside, I love that I'm considered a 'regular offender' by Dredd, pretty telling.  I've had one ban before this one, with NO warning. My comment was 'On the plus side most of /r/australia will be exempt' in relation to members of the public with financial/mental/physical disabilities and their capacity to be sued for copyright issues. That was my entire contribution to the thread and I got an immediate 5 day ban for 'trolling'.   Pretty clear it was a joke and was not offensive (and was upvoted to about +12 before it was removed) however Dredd cherry picked one part of the article which said 'autistic' and replied:  '[–]from dredd [M] via /r/australia/ sent 3 months ago Upvotes/downvotes irrelevant given the regular brigdaing which occurs here. If you're going to call ""most"" users of /r/australia autistic then you're clearly trolling.'

Over the course of ALP policy we had 50,000 arrivals in our waters alone. During the final 12 months of ALP in power, there were 700 asylum seeker drownings in the region and an estimated 300,000 Stateless asylum seekers boating around SE Asia, putting a burden on our neighbours. This situation was all encouraged by what was essentially an open border policy here, giving the incentive to desperate refugees to hop on unsafe boats and head East. We were already in a humanitarian crisis  and something had to be done because the crisis was growing exponentially. LNP policy is going to be adopted by the ALP eventually, because the boats have stopped and we can start closing down the detention centres as asylum seekers are processed and the centres are emptied.  So here you are telling us about cheap short slogans, while at the same time repeating the ""because Liberals are racist"" line. You couldn't be more of a cliche /r/Australian and you're welcome to post here all the time."

circlejerkaustralia,3coay5,sennais1,3,Thu Jul 9 15:28:00 2015 UTC,It really is an interesting one. Most people i know who read NewsLtd media are aware of the fact it is right leaning and they read it because it has articles they are interested in.  The Left seem to take a different stance and flock to The Guardian/ABC as their interpreter of truth instead of actually looking at the details and living in the real world.  This is why I believe they are so against Murdoch because they believe he has the power to influence people (like they are influenced by The Guardian/ABC) and want that balanced by the ABC.  It sure is a funny one when you point out that he only owns 30% of the print media and yet 60% of the print media sales go to his papers.
circlejerkaustralia,3coay5,Whytiederp,2,Thu Jul 9 20:17:55 2015 UTC,"Actual political opinion?  Isn't that banned here?  I'll bite: if you lob allegations of left-right bias you need better evidence than 'it's the vibe of the thing'.   they never cover topics against global warming,    The single most important program in Australia dealing with climate issues, in any medium, appears weekly on the ABC.  Landline would be the program that best tackles climate issues, anywhere in Australia.  If you're complaining about ABC mismanagement of climate-related topics, you're complaining about the program that reports back to primary producers.  Maybe you should approach the producers of Landline and demand they create content explaining why climate change is having no effect on their rural viewers' businesses.   or pro family values   What does that even mean?  The ABC has the best children's programming in Australia, and anyone who denies this is wrong.  Or are you complaining about swears and rudie bits?  Or that upsetting relationship between Bert and Ernie?  The ABC has been through at least a couple of recent independent media reviews.  No political bias was found.  You need to provide evidence at least as credible if you want to be anything other than an actual right-wing circlejerker.  What I believe you're complaining about is structural, cultural bias against conservatism in general.  Cultural conservatives don't all flock to the economic-right of politics.  Some of the staunchest conservatives hold tightly to left-wing views.  The moderation culture of r/Australia, for example, is left-politically but horribly conservative in every other way.  If you're conservative you don't like change.  You set yourself up with whatever resources you can muster and build a big wall around you and yours so nobody can threaten you.    r/Australia, the moderators in general and the people who spend their time there are overwhelmingly left-conservative.  The 'circlejerk' complained about here is real, and it deals with a mindset that attempts to protect itself emotionally by striking out at anything that threatens the easy kinship that comes from being a member of the herd.  Nobody progressive sits behind their computer, day after day, complaining about things they don't like.  Only a conservative does that, someone who has an investment in keeping their world exactly like it is for as long as they can.  You're like that, too.  If you complain about people and institutions disrespecting 'family values' you're saying ""me and mine are all that matters, and I get to decide what's good and bad"".  You are the opposite of a small-l liberal.  There are plenty of people on the right of politics who would despise you more than any truly progressive lefty.  A conservative ABC would be the end of the ABC.  If it stopped trying to appeal to the broadest possible audience it would wither and die.  Your complaint is basically that other Australians are different to you.  Content yourself with Chris Berg on the Drum, endless hawkish business commentators on financial programs and with Compass.  Or you could try talkback radio, where the rest of your circlejerking tribe live."

He said he got in and clicked his floor and waited for a minute. After a couple floors went by Mike Baird just turned to him and said, ""Hey, do you know who I am?"" And James, to his credit looked at Mike Baird straight in the eyes and said, ""Yeah. I really like your dad's work."" And got off the elevator. True story, swear to god."

He glanced over at my shopping on the belt, looked at his collection of off-brand weetbix, salt and a bag of brushed potatoes, then glanced back at my shopping.  A look of consternation appeared on his face, like storm clouds gathering at sea.  Something was troubling him.  This small fugue state went on for at least twelve seconds.  Finally, he reached over and took my tray of pork sausages, placed them at the front of his grocery pile, made eye contact with me and gave me a small half nod.  I could see the anxiety leaving his brow, but slowly.  He then turned back to his groceries, stared at them for a few seconds, and nudged the tray of sausages slightly over the divider so they were touching the flavoured yogurts of the headscarfed lady ahead of him."

This happened a couple years ago when I was working in Gove, NT. I just got home from work and I was walking to check my mail box, as I normally do first thing when I get home. Coincidentally, I had arrived at the same time as the postman - but he hadn't noticed me pulling up. He was dressed in the typical high-vis jacket and was riding the postman motorbike. As I got closer I noticed the postman was taking mail out of my mailbox, not putting it in. I yelled ""hey! that's my mail!"" and he looked up at me, startled and wide-eyed. It was Mike fucking Baird. He rode off down the street and was gone in seconds, which is all it takes the fucker. I never saw him again."
