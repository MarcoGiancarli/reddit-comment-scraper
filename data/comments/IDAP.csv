IDAP,3dmxh0,baronv0ntoast,8,Fri Jul 17 17:24:22 2015 UTC,"I like most of the cast, the ones I don't like I just don't know enough about to have an opinion on.  I have enjoyed everything I have seem from Feig, even his performance in Three O'clock High.  The reboot aspect is disappointing.  The packs and thrower are kind of junky, though I have heard rumor that wasn't Feig's fault.  The ecto looks cheap compared to the original.  The uniforms have a great base, but the stripes make them look like trash collectors instead of exterminators.  I think had Sony not pushed Reitman out, he could have reined in some of the decisions I did not like, while giving room for Feig to still create a film he could have been proud of.  In the end, Reitman gave up too much control and we lost out on a proper sequel."

All money raised is going toward helping veterans, the local WWII museum, and outreach. We would like to capture the rich feel of the era and that's where a vintage golden era style poster would come in.   3) We can discuss the project and price in greater detail if you're up for it and I'd like to see some of your work.   4) You'll be given credit for making the poster I guess. I'm not quite sure what the title would be.   5) You'll have like the a month or so.   6) We'll work all that out fairly.   7) I don't know if I'd say ""mass produced"".

IDAP,3bk35s,RBRTPNG,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:37:43 2015 UTC,haha no I think you're absolutely right. My shading game is really weak at this point in time. I should have used more solid blacks in the main background to bring out the action. Regardless of your comic experience your opinion is spot on and it matters as much to me as anyone else's so I appreciate the input.

IDAP,3ayk4m,travisboatner,5,Wed Jun 24 15:15:55 2015 UTC,...What media did you use and what was the rendering process?
IDAP,3ayk4m,Made_you_read_penis,3,Wed Jun 24 18:21:48 2015 UTC,Photoshop and a Cintiq. The largest resolution I could find of her I had two photos side by side. I converted it to black and white and put out guides. Then after getting close highlights and shadows I used a smudge tool 30% with spacing and scattering on to get a nice blend then repeated until they were pretty damn close. Then I lowered and raised the contrast on both pics to make sure they were the same in high and low contrasts. Then used a small brush low opacity for strokes on highlights and lowlights. About two weeks worth of time.

All the main curves and proportions match the original photo exactly when overlaid.  Edit: Not that i think there's anything wrong with tracing or overpainting, just that lying about it is silly."
IDAP,3ayk4m,whoacarlile,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:48:22 2015 UTC,"If you think I just painted over it, Just means the work I put into it was worth it. I spent weeks getting everything laid out and even more time blending and putting in final touches. I smoked a lot of weed and it was just one of those things I'd get on everyday and say ""I still don't think it's done"" in the end it wasn't perfect and I put more time into making the face realistic but I accepted that because that's where I wanted the focus to be. It's my best piece I made in 2011 and I've delt with people being skeptical since I made it. I used to get butthurt about it but now it's a positive thing for me.   http://imgur.com/rLtbmvp"

IDAP,3ay1ap,travisboatner,2,Wed Jun 24 12:26:18 2015 UTC,"Looks awesome! Definitely has that feel. You're better than me so take what I say with a grain of salt.  Your proportions are all rock-solid, but your issues come in with lighting. I'm not sure how much thought you put into it, but think about it more. In ""normal"" lighting, the upper eyelid casts a shadow on the eye itself, not the lower one, so you kinda did the whites of the eyes backwards if that makes sense. The eyes also seem a bit too bright compared to the rest of the face; I think the rest should have increased contrast rather than darkening the eyes though. The brightest part of the lip should be brighter than the brightest part of the chin, for example. Speaking of the chin, the shadows on the neck need to be way more dramatic - the neck is lighter than the shade on the bottom of the lip, which isn't right at all. Also, the ears should be a bit darker as they're in the shadow of the hair.  The proportions are all spot-on, which is awesome. This is really good and I'm being nit-picky, so don't think I'm tearing it apart."
IDAP,3ay1ap,fkwillrice,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"The brightness on the computer is messed up and the whites of the eyes all looked one color. But I do know what you mean. Thank you for the proportion compliments. As far as lighting, unless I'm making it look ULTRA realistic I have trouble showing lighting with strokes. I usually have to fully blend it to make it look right and I wanted a painting that still showed strokes completely different than my other work. This is sort of a practice on lighting is actually what it was. So thank you for the critique."
IDAP,3ay1ap,fkwillrice,2,Wed Jun 24 15:10:46 2015 UTC,"No problem! It looks awesome, keep it up!  I'm only recently getting back into art from a long hiatus, I wish I never quit.

IDAP,39i0n7,StealthPanther,5,Thu Jun 11 21:14:52 2015 UTC,"These are very good!  However, I'd say what you need to work on is translating the ""areas of shadow and light"" into actual forms on the face. What I mean is that it feels like you sort of outlined an area as ""shadow"" and filled it in... instead of trying to render the shapes that the shadows represent.  You've got the feeling of stencils and not people, if that makes sense?  Also, push your darks. You've got some kickass opportunities for some great range, but it seems kind of washed out? That might just be from the scan/photo though."
IDAP,39i0n7,Hurm,2,Fri Jun 12 02:52:45 2015 UTC,No its in the actual rendering. I was trying not to get a graphite shine.
IDAP,39i0n7,Hurm,3,Fri Jun 12 14:38:12 2015 UTC,"Ah!  Yeah, just push those darks really hard and then use a different setup for photographing the pieces. (IIRC, you use two lights at 45 degree angles from the piece. It should light up the work and reduce shine.)  Worst case scenario, do some post-production touchups digitally."
IDAP,39i0n7,Paint_fuelled_engine,3,Fri Jun 12 14:54:59 2015 UTC,I like what Hurm said about the shadows. Don't try to do photorealism just for photorealism's sake. You already have some nice skills here - I'd say just explore what you can do with those and see where it takes you instead of trying to learn the same formula as other people!
IDAP,39i0n7,TheCaringAsshole,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:49:32 2015 UTC,"I definitely will. I feel like if I push into realism, it will solidify my work a bit more. Maybe give me a few more techniques to play around with."

IDAP,39i0n7,Hurm,2,Fri Jun 12 14:42:20 2015 UTC,Go darker in some of your shadows.  you want a full range of shades.  It will add a ton more depth to your drawings!  Particularly in the first one.  but proportions and structure are nice!
IDAP,39i0n7,drodeo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:10:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I think I'm going to try to push my darks more. Think I might do this with 2h extra hard charcoal. Never used the stuff before, don't know how they blend. I do know that they can't layer. I'll just have to see how it goes."
IDAP,39i0n7,drodeo,2,Fri Jun 12 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"Er..  Hard = not great for blending.   The pencils (not the same as charcoal, but still) I favor are usually 2b for most work 4-6b for the midrange shadows and a 9xxb for the blacks from the pit of my soul."
IDAP,39i0n7,rnicholson1,2,Fri Jun 12 14:57:15 2015 UTC,I will see if I have a 9xxb floating around in my kit. The nearest art store is around an hours drive from where I live.

When blocking in large colors, I'd set flow at 10-20%. When blending, I'd drop it to 5% and usually set brush opacity at 50% or lower. I also set the spacing of my brushes to 10-12%. Aside from that, nothing special."

IDAP,38tx1y,eatcitrus,3,Sat Jun 6 21:00:43 2015 UTC,"Is that a tentacle? I'm not sure octopus is the most appealing sea creature for a restaurant. There's very little contrast between the wheel, water, and tentacle. Have you thought about how it would look  in a one color situation?"
IDAP,38tx1y,mckickass,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:00:50 2015 UTC,"It's supposed to be a banner, it's where I put the name of the restaurant. Not sure how well it reads though. Thanks for the feedback, my values are all really similar so I should definitely push it a little more."
IDAP,38tx1y,IAmButtHurtAMA,3,Sun Jun 7 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"My thoughts: it's too bright. Nothing really pops out at me. All the colors are very washed, and hard to focus on. It also looks like a minimalist app icon which is something I wouldn't think twice about. Since this is a restaurant logo you want something that sticks out and catches your attention. Change the colors, and add more detail to represent what it is your logo is for. Because right now, it just looks like an app icon."
IDAP,38tx1y,GottaDraw,3,Sat Jun 6 23:16:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely contrast. The wheel, tentacle and sea are all way too close in value. Desaturate it to see what I mean. All logos should work first and foremost in grayscale and a small format"

Not Internet!) and at the realization that I'm going to fail my calc final I decided to do a one line drawing, which actually calms me down a bit from the brink.  I guess the numerous times I've done this before counted as practice because this is possibly the best one line drawing of its kind I drew in a long time. Either that or I am REALLY stressed out.

IDAP,38rjr1,tikibowtiki,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:07:00 2015 UTC,"It is coming along nicely.  Quit being afraid and just draw. The more tight you are, the more tight your drawing will feel and less expressive.  I've said this before to other people..  It it really is just a piece of paper, some pencil lead and your time.  If you get bold with it and you don't like it.. Consider it practice for the next one and move on..  The practice and learning is what is important.  The eyes are starting to develop the darker shades your are going to need to pull it all together.  That level of contrast will need to be evident in more areas of the drawing to make it feel alive.  The hard part is (as you have expressed) that level of contrast and detail doesn't exist in the photo - so you have to SEE it in your mind before you can get it on paper.  One way to help exaggerate the different depths would be to take the scanned photo, and eliminate the color of it with photo manipulation software.  Once it's black and white you can work the contrast with the same software.  For iPhone, there's a great app called BLACK which can help you begin to see the world from a different perspective.    Spend a few minutes studying the classical painters and you will begin to see the level of contrast and depth they use in their portraits.  Truly amazing.  And one more thing...  It may not be PC but you may have to invent some skin imperfections.  Portrait photographers filter and eliminate skin tones and lines and folds to make a more ""appealing"" image, but it looses so much life and humanity in the process.    You're on the right track, technically, your lines and shapes are great...  Just stop being so nervous and get jiggly with it! I hope you follow up and show us the end result...."
IDAP,38rjr1,tikibowtiki,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:58:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, I actually took it to photoshop and desaturated it to get this. I am usually a digital artist and haven't done traditional in 8 years. I'll get all the colors out and lay down the contrast once I feel this ""layer "" is complete. As for a background what do you think I should do. A drop of water got on the paper next to the cheek and I feel I can't leave it white because it stands out. I feel a gradient dark to light bottom to top would look nice but i don't know yet. Thanks for your feedback"
