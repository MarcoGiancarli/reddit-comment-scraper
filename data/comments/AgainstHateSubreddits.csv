Banning you with that sort of petulance only shows a fear of what another person has to say, even if it's just redundant masturbation over moral superiority by simplifying a complex world into hate and love, and saying you stand for love while other people are just evil and stand for hate.  If that makes you feel better, have at it."

But you guys don't redundantly masturbate over catch phrases and copypastas right? You don't have active users flooding other subreddits with oinks and eeks and slurs right?  You couldn't be more wrong. For CT, it boils down to genetics. For the rest of the educated world, it's much more nuanced. If that blanket view makes you feel better, have at it."

It's a lot harder to justifiably point out that they're making death threats when you're doing the same to them.

If you wanna see brigading, notice how our mod's Pao joke was upvoted to the top of that announcements thread... until SRS linked to it and it got thousands of downvotes and some angry comments.   Yes, because you guys brigaded it first, and then SRS alerted the rest of the decent community to it, and we voiced our own opinions.   You SJW's despise us racists, but we're amused by you at the most.   I'm pretty sure you guys despise us more than we despise you. We're not the ones making serious death threats.

Yishan specifically talks about how the Board of Directors wanted to wipe out the hate subreddits and Pao was against it.  No one else argued because it gave Reddit the perfect cover to let them stay.  No one could accuse Reddit (as a corporation) of being racist or sexist because they had perhaps the most recognizable feminist in silicon valley as their CEO, and if she can put up with them, then so can we.  She even argued against the board to save the subreddits and only shut down the ones that had gone out of their way to harass people on other sites (like FPH did).  But Redditers just couldn't handle letting an asian woman be CEO.  They did nothing but harass harass harass until, finally, they got their way.  Their way being Ellen Pao no longer being CEO.  Which, in turn, stripped away the excuse Reddit Inc. could use to say they weren't being racist/sexist by allowing this shit to stay.  Redditers fucked up their playground by being SO racist and SO sexist that they simply cannot be ignored anymore.  Beautifully poetic, is it not?"

Like come on.. You guys spout shit about unemployment and crime as if it applies to the majority of the race.     I posted this a few months ago, are you aware of these statistics?    According to the 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment report, gangs are responsible for an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most jurisdictions, and up to 90 percent in others. [1]  Around 0.011% of blacks committed murder in 2013 [2]  Around 0.011% of blacks committed rape in 2013 [2]  Around 0.2% of blacks commit aggravated Assault in 2013 [2]  Around 0.11% of blacks committed robbery in 2013 [2]  Around 0.77% of blacks commit ""Other assaults"" in 2013[2]    [1]https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/2011-national-gang-threat-assessment        [2]https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43  Also if you do the math you'll find out that only around 8% of black people are in some phase of the United States correctional system.    I mean shit, if I hadn't done my own research and was only aware of the cherry-picked statistics that Coontown provides I'd probably believe that the majority of blacks are absolute scumbags, however that's obviously not the case.

AgainstHateSubreddits,3dbh25,Historyovermath12,8,Wed Jul 15 03:04:54 2015 UTC,"33 percent of all blacks will be in prison in their life time.      Yeah but why is that? That same report gives some reasons as to why this might be:      The reasons for this discrepancy are widely debated, but the report discourages readers from blaming either the higher-than-average crime rate among blacks and Latinos in the U.S. or the presence of deliberate racism in the criminal justice system. While those factors may contribute to the problem, the reasons go much deeper, the report contends.   The problem begins with police activity. According to Justice Department data cited in the report, police arrested black youth for drug crimes at more than twice the rate of white youth between 1980 and 2010, nationwide. Yet a 2012 study from the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that white high-school students were slightly more likely to have abused illegal drugs within the past month than black students of the same age.    Blacks are also far more likely than whites to be stopped by the police while driving. The Sentencing Project report largely attributes the racial disparities in both traffic and drug arrests to “implicit racial bias” on the part of the police.    The disparities don’t end with arrests. Because blacks and Latinos are generally poorer than whites, they are more likely to rely on court-appointed public defenders, who tend to work for agencies that are underfunded and understaffed. In 2012, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, more than 70 percent of public defender offices reported that they were struggling to come up with the funding needed to provide adequate defense services to poor people. By last March, the problem was so bad that Attorney General Eric Holder declared the public defense system to be in a ""state of crisis.”    Racial disparities within the justice system have been exacerbated by the war on drugs, the report argues. The drug war led the country’s population of incarcerated drug offenders to soar from 42,000 in 1980 to nearly half a million in 2007. From 1999 to 2005, African Americans constituted about 13 percent of drug users, but they made up about 46 percent of those convicted for drug offenses, the report points out.      ________________________________________________________________________________    Blacks are 3 times more likely to rape than whites.   True, however a reasonable person isn't going to hate the ENTIRE RACE considering only 0.011% of blacks are committing rape in any given year.

AgainstHateSubreddits,3db4m7,minibeep,4,Thu Jul 16 01:44:02 2015 UTC,Reddit chooses what they allow to be said on their servers. Racism should not be tolerated on any respectable site.

Can I call your parents and say 'I will murder minibeep if you don't send me 1,000 dollars?' Can I call you and say 'This is the police, you need to come to the station now or you will be fined four billion dollars'?  I don't believe in totally free speech, and more to the point, I don't believe in hate speech, and most to the point, I don't believe reddit has any obligation to host all free speech, or any hatespeech."

AgainstHateSubreddits,3cyaim,DsagjiiggsScjjigsjsb,17,Sat Jul 11 21:44:01 2015 UTC,The assertion that coontown is quarantined is absolute horseshit. Of course they are going to visit other parts of the site because what prevents it. They like spreading their propaganda all over the site. Admins are unwilling to take action as long as they don't get too much negative media coverage and that's why they are denying the extent of this problem.
AgainstHateSubreddits,3cyaim,-who_is_john_galt-,-9,Sat Jul 11 22:22:40 2015 UTC,"Because deleting /r/fatpeoplehate worked so well.   Its quarantines not because it doesn't occasionally leak, its quarantined because at least there's only 1 coontown instead of 20. Also much easier to keep an eye on that way."

Also, it's not just one.  Also, /r/fatpeoplehate, in the context of ""harmful communities grounding their existence in freeze-peaches"", for me, comes way after the CT subs. It's like, victimization of young women a-la JB, then CT's white supremacist terrorist circlejerk a close second, then FPH."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3cyaim,ostrich_semen,6,Sun Jul 12 18:25:39 2015 UTC,Banning FPH did work well. They had a childish tantrum and then they all moved to voat. I have seen a lot less fph bullshit on the defaults ever since.

AgainstHateSubreddits,3cyaim,Portals23,14,Sun Jul 12 04:41:35 2015 UTC,"What I would love to see is a moderation tool that allows you to set karma profile filters. I.e., if a poster has karma +500 in CoonTown, automatically remove their posts from your sub.  The problem, as I see it as a moderator of this sub, is less that CoonTown exists, and more that it's impossible to keep them out of other subs. I don't actually care that they have an echochamber to chat with one another, I care that they A ) spread misinformation, and B ) post said misinformation all over reddit.  I know a lot of subs would benefit from being able to set such a filter - for example, I wager /r/science would set one for posters with positive karma in, say, /r/antivax or /r/climateskeptics."

AgainstHateSubreddits,3cyaim,EugeneNix,4,Sun Jul 12 14:05:29 2015 UTC,"And? If you use an account to blather idiocy, you should not be able to use that account to post to legitimate subs. Obviously all you need to do is make a new account, but no filter is perfect - I'm not interested in silencing people, just providing more moderation tools.  This would be useful for you guys too - if someone has positive karma in, say, /r/equality or /r/civilrights or /r/judaism something, chances are they aren't going to bring much to CoonTown or GTK or whatever.   But sure - what if instead of the filter autoremoving the comments, it autoreported them, so moderators could more easily keep track of things, and remove stuff they didn't want posted?"
AgainstHateSubreddits,3cyaim,DanglyW,5,Sun Jul 12 15:39:04 2015 UTC,"I think, if coontown, gasthekikes, whiterights, etc etc were to stay in their own subreddit or when the users of the aforementioned subreddits were to not involve what they discuss in other subreddits, I think it's perfectly okay not to ban them.  Are the subreddits hateful and distateful?  Absolutely.  But really, it makes them feel like there's a large community of people that support them and if that helps them sleep at night knowing that 17,600 strangers on the internet hold the same hatred for black people as they do, then all the power to them, as long as they're not bringing any of their crap anywhere else around here.  I was listening to a podcast the other day (WTF with Marc Maron, his interview with President Obama), and he just finished a show and there was a redneck outside having a cigar after seeing another show in a neighboring theater (he didn't know who Marc is), and Marc knew that in politics they would disagree on fundamentally everything, but since he didn't bring politics up, they were able to have a nice discussion.  While I disagree with the views that people on these hateful subreddits have, I may very well have had a discussion with a user of one of those subreddits and not have known.  Is it likely?  No, but I think the policy should be shifted from banning hateful subreddits altogether (which it seems that is what they're doing), to a policy against bringing such opinions into areas of the site where these opinions may hurt someone (ie taking racist comments from coontown into /r/showerthoughts).  Probably an unpopular opinion here, but meh, /2cents."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3cyaim,jajolt,7,Sun Jul 12 23:08:42 2015 UTC,"As a bit of homework, I think you could pick 10 random CoonTown posters, and look at their karma profiles.

You'll of course posit that they are poor because somethingsomethingblacksarebad, but poverty and crime are directly correlated.

In layman’s terms, the statistical results suggest that even if whites were just as disadvantaged as blacks and Hispanics the association between race and violent crime would still be almost as great. It may seem harsh to state it so plainly, but the single best indicator of an area’s violent crime rate is its racial/ethnic mix. The correlation between high school education and violent crime rate is 0.37; the square is 0.14. Racial mix predicts the violent crime rate more than four times better than lack of a high school education."

Races were kept isolated for thousands of years and they developed certain traits. Some of those being good for the advancement of modern society (North East Asians and Ashkenazi Jews score especially high on IQ tests, even above whites!). Now the Africans that we (America) bought from Africa didn't possess high intelligence, though they did possess good endurance. They were then further selectively bred for strength (the weakest died in the fields and the strongest were chosen to breed the African women).  This created African-Americans, a group bred not only for endurance by the harsh African conditions, but for strength for performing field work. That's why /r/CoonTown is against keeping blacks within our society and is pro-segregation. Giving blacks their own cut of USA to live in or shipping them back to Africa with reparation money are both reasonable options."

If that collectively made Africans stupider, well, we can hardly blame the slaves for that.

I love the 'ol CoonTown claim that African conditions are 'harsh'. Because Africa, like, all of it, has just one climate, and that climate is HARSH. Or, if we're arguing that Africans are stupid, Africa is a paradise, and Blacks are dumb because they didn't have to adapt. You guys are all over the argumentative map.

In some respects, Chinese civilization attained a level of technology that was fairly on par with African/Aztec technological achievement as well - this was, of course due to the fact that Confucianism stymied technological progress in China.

AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,NewJerseyFreakshow,17,Fri Jun 26 19:06:02 2015 UTC,I like how there's little gay snoos on a rainbow on their banner.
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,miniflip,4,Fri Jun 26 20:56:28 2015 UTC,I found that hilarious.  I'm glad I wasn't the only one who spotted that.
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,proGGthrowaway,14,Fri Jun 26 20:57:42 2015 UTC,lmao why are antisemites so sensitive
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,mrgoodnighthairdo,9,Fri Jun 26 21:05:35 2015 UTC,Same sex marriage is literally white genocide.
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,Izawwlgood,5,Fri Jun 26 22:51:36 2015 UTC,literally
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,my_online_alias,7,Sat Jun 27 04:39:59 2015 UTC,"A lot of the people in that comment section are threatening to ""take to the streets"" or whatever. Not to mention the ""race war now"" image in the sidebar.  Isn't there something illegal about inciting violence? Because that is what they are blatantly doing here. Would reporting this thread even make any difference?"
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,TheEmbernova,6,Fri Jun 26 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"You could try it.  They're not supposed to be doing ""calls to violence"" but I saw what you are talking about.    I don't know how much of a difference it will make considering that sub has got to be on the list of soon to be banned subs.  I mean shit, it's called gasthekikes."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,TotesMessenger,5,Fri Jun 26 20:37:32 2015 UTC,That's a reactionary in a nutshell -- all bark and no bite. Especially since the internet makes being a tough guy so easy!
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,iamaneviltaco,7,Fri Jun 26 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:   [/r/gasthekikes] /r/AgainstHateSubreddits gets their panties in a twist because Reddit is an American company and their precious gay-marriage Supreme Court said the kind of speech on /r/gasthekikes isn't illegal (Brandenburg v. Ohio)   If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads. (Info / Contact)"
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,jay520,11,Fri Jun 26 21:47:29 2015 UTC,"ROFL, all aboard the coontown/gtk butthurt train."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,TRVDante,8,Fri Jun 26 22:18:49 2015 UTC,ALL ABOARD THE CRAZY-TRAIN TO DRAMA TOWN.
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,jay520,5,Sat Jun 27 01:40:33 2015 UTC,"I could never understand how someone could be so pissed at what two other willing individuals decide to do with their lives. If they don't think gay people should get married, then that's one thing, but to actually be upset that it happens...that's pretty crazy. I mean, I don't think people should smoke tobacco, but I don't go ballistic at the thought that people are smoking cigarettes legally."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,TRVDante,-3,Fri Jun 26 22:11:27 2015 UTC,"Why do people get their panties in a twist about coontown, GTK and AntiPOZI though?"
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,jay520,10,Fri Jun 26 23:38:56 2015 UTC,"If you can't see why a sub titled ""Gas the Kikes"", a direct and explicit assault on someone's identity, is upsetting, then I don't know what to tell you."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,iamaneviltaco,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:42:42 2015 UTC,"And the stuff on Anarchist, leftist subreddits isn't? Go ask the average poster there what they think about whiteness and see how they react. Why wouldn't the people whose whiteness is part of their identity feel threatened?"
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,DanglyW,7,Fri Jun 26 23:50:44 2015 UTC,"What the hell are you talking about? I don't visit ""Anarchist, Leftist subreddits*"", nor have i mentioned them. Maybe they are threatening; maybe they aren't. I've made no reference to these places."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b84so,kurwaspierdalaj,3,Fri Jun 26 23:54:02 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad. Dude obviously missed the irony in defending racist subs, while at the same time wondering why some people can't stand white folk. Honestly, it's like trying to explain physics to a 4 year old. Not worth the effort."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b6367,NewJerseyFreakshow,7,Fri Jun 26 07:18:08 2015 UTC,What the fuck did I just read?
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b6367,NotADamsel,7,Fri Jun 26 10:32:08 2015 UTC,Hate
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b6367,DJboomshanka,6,Fri Jun 26 11:22:43 2015 UTC,I was raised by a member of the KKK. I know intimately what hate is. This is something more severe. I'm kinda unnerved.
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b6367,NotADamsel,6,Fri Jun 26 12:02:29 2015 UTC,/u/4to6 is a special sort of redditor. I've seen a few of their posts and they're all as bad as this
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b6367,DJboomshanka,10,Fri Jun 26 12:10:27 2015 UTC,"I know that it's been said a thousand times, but how can Reddit ban something like fatpeoplehate while allowing fucking coontown to stay active? It's like getting hazmat to remove a small pot of overflowing piss in the kitchen while completely ignoring the open cesspool in the backyard."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b6367,NotADamsel,4,Fri Jun 26 12:42:18 2015 UTC,Search for 4to6 in /r/isrconspiracyracist and behold the hate he spews.
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b6367,NotADamsel,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:03:04 2015 UTC,"I don't like SJWs, because they are racist assholes. Looks like I've found another dickhead to slap that tag onto."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3b6367,NotADamsel,4,Sun Jun 28 21:14:05 2015 UTC,"Incoherent racist rants are not ""the truth lol"" and you're shitposting anyways, so bye. You're also a frequent contributor to TRP and CoonTown."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3ayedn,DsagjiiggsScjjigsjsb,11,Wed Jun 24 14:29:16 2015 UTC,"Even if that sub has is ""small"" and ""not representative of the Reddit community as a whole,"" how do you explain the fact that it's so popular in a default sub that nearly everyone who looked at the front page yesterday read? Why do they have so much support?"
AgainstHateSubreddits,3ayedn,my_online_alias,9,Wed Jun 24 15:04:54 2015 UTC,Freeze peach or something
AgainstHateSubreddits,3ayedn,spamatarms,0,Wed Jun 24 15:05:58 2015 UTC,Because people can only ignore facts for so long. Plus triggering SJW's and watching them circlejerk about how high and mighty they are is hilarious
AgainstHateSubreddits,3ayedn,burnwhencaught,2,Mon Jul 6 17:49:03 2015 UTC,"media censorship   I've got the feeling you have no idea what this means.   how statistics and facts are clouded by people's feelings   Yeah... I've really got the feeling you have no idea what any of this means, or how any of it works."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3ayedn,burnwhencaught,2,Fri Jun 26 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"I haven't found a good subreddit with information on what I'm looking for.   As the old adage goes, seek and ye shall find.  But seriously, what kind of information are you looking for?"
AgainstHateSubreddits,3ayedn,quaxon,-7,Fri Jun 26 03:04:21 2015 UTC,Because the majority of white people in america are racist. Every minority knows this as we experience it first hand on a daily basis and the only ones who deny it are sheltered whites who never leave their bubble.
AgainstHateSubreddits,3ayedn,Sodaholic,6,Fri Jun 26 03:27:37 2015 UTC,"And shattering their cognitive dissonance will only lead to them plugging their ears with their fingers and saying ""nyahnyahnyahnyahnyah"""

AgainstHateSubreddits,3ayedn,keepYourMouthShut,8,Thu Jun 25 00:54:02 2015 UTC,you would go back to a time with no antibiotics or technology just so you can own black people?   yes    Wow that's actual insanity
AgainstHateSubreddits,3ayedn,chillenchillada,4,Thu Jun 25 01:48:16 2015 UTC,"Really highlights the disconnect between FPH and logic.   My guess is that they've come to see CoonTown as kindred souls, or else are highlighting the fact that they're still active because they think this proves some point.  Because they still can't get it through their heads that their banishment was due to tampering with other subreddits, and, above all, organizing an effort to attack some imgur employees who wanted nothing to do with the ""debate""."
AgainstHateSubreddits,3awg9m,Amy_of_Dallas,9,Wed Jun 24 01:31:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, good find.  I've heard some of the coontowners talking about ""the day of the rope"" but this is sick.  Pure hate."
