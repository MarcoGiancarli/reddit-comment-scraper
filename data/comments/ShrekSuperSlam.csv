ShrekSuperSlam,3cvxsa,AliMcBaba,2,Sat Jul 11 05:46:38 2015 UTC,"I have lots of experience with modding Melee/Brawl, and I have been very curious about this as well. I don't think character changes are needed (way too early for that), but stage changes and removal of items would be great. My friend told me he would get into SSS only if I made 20XX for SSS, and added All Star to the main menu."
ShrekSuperSlam,3cvxsa,BoastingToast,2,Sat Jul 11 18:52:49 2015 UTC,"All that needs to be changed is to take out items, infinites, nerf some crumpet dashes, and add Farquaad."

ShrekSuperSlam,3cfpqd,404House,3,Tue Jul 7 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"Some of the really bottom tiers are terrible (Captain Hook and Quasimodo have no standout qualities at all that I can see), but top tiers encompasses quite a few characters, almost all very different.   The tier list can be found on this subreddit's wiki."
ShrekSuperSlam,3cfpqd,Snowman_Eater,3,Tue Jul 7 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"Well know players are: ShrekBoards | Kirby, ShrekBoards | Crumpet, BoastingToast and Murtag.  Two of which have advance shrekniques named after them."
ShrekSuperSlam,3cfpqd,Zero_Suit_Salt,3,Tue Jul 7 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"Murtag dropping is literally in the manual for the game. It's called ""fast dropping"" iirc. It's cool that he found it independently though."
ShrekSuperSlam,3cfpqd,onmatest,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:47:26 2015 UTC,"Shield Dropping is different from Murtag Dropping, Murtag Dropping is the act of using a Shield Drop to cancel the endlag/reduce startup of an aerial attack."

ShrekSuperSlam,3cfpqd,Zero_Suit_Salt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:43:24 2015 UTC,"You can read my guide that I wrote, as ZSS posted, here The tier gap isn't TOO bad, players are still picking up characters deemed low tier and finding new things with them, I just introduced my friend to the game last night and he already has a wicked G-nome, a character that everyone claims is bottom tier. Well known players consist of Kirby (Snowman_Eater), Crumpet, myself, ZSS, and I would say Murtag but I can't say I've ever heard about him doing anything other than finding Murtag Dropping (no disrespect intended.) The top characters in my opinion, are RRH (basically agreed upon by the community for best), Gingerbread Man, and Black Knight. Cyclops is extremely slow, has no crumpet dash, and has huge endlag if you miss any attacks. The upside is that his damage output is HUGE, but so is Black Knight's, and he has much more utility and movement, soooo basically there's no reason to play Cyclops instead of Black Knight, but if you really wanted to, it's possible."

ShrekSuperSlam,3c5o72,pokemon64ism,3,Sun Jul 5 01:22:32 2015 UTC,"Mains: Just play with all the characters, and pick one you like. After you've found one, stick to them and improve.   Tech: Go through this sub and watch the videos that talk about some of the advanced tech within this game. The game's competitive meta is still quite young so you might even discover some tech of your own.   Local scene: chances are there isn't one lol, so it's up to you to foster it. Take the game to your friends places, introduce them to the game, maybe even host a tourney!"
ShrekSuperSlam,3c5o72,RashAttack,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:17:00 2015 UTC,"I will be releasing a video soon that will touch on getting started with this game, but until then, I'll give you the rundown For finding a main, it's largely based on what you feel comfortable with. Characters feel very different in this game, and it's up to you to find your own character and explore their options, there's only a few characters (RRH, TBK, Dronkey, ect) that have been explored extensively, so look at the properties of your attacks, find what works and what doesn't, and all that good stuff. The most important techs to learn are Crumpet Dashing and Murtag Dropping. To Crumpet Dash, perform an air dash by pressing analog direction + A, then cancel it with a grab for a good engage option, or shield for a quick movement option. Murtag Dropping is performed by using an aerial attack and canceling the endlag with shield. Effectiveness varies with each character. Shield Drops are also very useful, just shield in mid air to drop quickly, allowing you to alter the height of your jump. Remember the importance of confirming into your Slam. Some characters/stages make it easy to avoid or camp out your Slam, in that case you want to hit them with a knockdown or stun attack, or just throw them, followed by your Slam, making it guaranteed. As for finding your scene, the chances of there being a scene in your area are fairly low. You can ask around this sub to find if anyone else in your area plays SSS competitively, but odds are, there isn't, so that's up to you to fix. Practice, get some friends or fellow Smash players into it, and try your best to start a scene. We're still very early in, and we need all the help we can get for recruiting new players and getting scenes started around the world."
ShrekSuperSlam,3bymi6,Yushwuth,2,Fri Jul 3 05:46:00 2015 UTC,"I've toyed with dronkey a lot myself (of course) and I have reached similar conclusions. Murtag dropping the spinning air attack (we call it his Nair) is the first way I used the technique.  Unfortunately the fact be still has lag even after murtag dropping it before it hits makes it kinda unviable except for silly mind games. His smash air attack (I forget if that's the right term), where you hit a direction and attack at the same time in the air, is a great move though. Murtag dropping it / crumpet dashing it is amazing, really safe move. That may be his defining move. He can continuously gain height and swoop across the whole stage. His ground combos, in an aerial based meta, don't do too much, with one exception, his A B A. We call it the laser. You can you turn freely while doing it and it has a tonne of hitboxes. Sometimes it can hit the opponent many times at once, quite like peaches down smash from melee. It can give you 90% of your slam at once. It's a really powerful move that can swing the tides of entire games.  Really great to see dronkey getting played. It's tough versus the gingys and the RRHs but, imo is a winnable battle."
ShrekSuperSlam,3bymi6,TaruMurtag,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"I feel like the lag after a  murtag dropped air attack is negligible though, but I agree with your point about his safe crumpet dash and ability to swoop around.  A B A is a really awesome move, I hope people use it plenty in games.  And yeah, I hope to see more diversification in characters and more people playing dronkey."
ShrekSuperSlam,3bymi6,onmatest,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:05:44 2015 UTC,"Yushwuth and I were experimenting with characters in the game. He figured out dronkey really quick with his zoning aerial flames (he played puff in melee). While he was writing up this post, I messed with dronkey. Let's just say I discovered something interesting ;).   Edit: it seems as though anti-air attack is pretty much better than a jump in almost all situations since its a jump with a hitbox."
ShrekSuperSlam,3bymi6,O-ICY,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:26:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this!  I spent a while trying to figure out Dronkey. He seemed to have so much potential with the mobility of his aerials, but I could never keep control of him to any degree. Glad to hear putting in the time can make him into a strong character.  You should try recording some footage of your play, if you can, but this is a huge help to the scene! Thanks!"
ShrekSuperSlam,3bymi6,faggot_human_trash,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:20:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at some point I definitely want to put some of the things I mentioned into video format.  Although Dronkey's Air Attack seems kind of random at first, by adjusting where you are facing just before your jump and murtag dropping at certain points, it actually is very fast and somewhat controlled.  It makes him probably one of the fastest characters in the sky."
ShrekSuperSlam,3bymi6,wzhao65,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"I've always ranked Dronkey very high on my tier lists just for potential, and as it stands I believe he has the best mix ups in the entire game."

ShrekSuperSlam,3boaas,Zero_Suit_Salt,2,Tue Jun 30 21:00:55 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add that this tourney in general is a good place to start, due to the range of skills and playstyles displayed. You can watch the early games where top players (Kirby, Crumpet) demonstrate how to dominate new players, RashAttack adapts to the game very quickly and through this offers you a view into how to progress at the game."
ShrekSuperSlam,3boaas,O-ICY,2,Wed Jul 1 19:32:13 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm the best RRH player atm, I recently recieved an Elgato and my local Smash scene has some interest in SSS, so I'll be streaming some friendlies and hopefully tournaments pretty soon.

ShrekSuperSlam,3bmlys,Mmeaninglessnamee,3,Tue Jun 30 13:09:13 2015 UTC,"I've found wall jumps are great on Gingy, especially against RRH. Ideally, you'll want to be slightly higher than the apex of RRH's jumps, then time a Crumpet Dash into towards her. Wall jumping helps you get the extra height you need to take her down. In the end, it's an extra jump, and that can be helpful in a lot of ways, although I imagine that's character and matchup dependant."
ShrekSuperSlam,3bmlys,O-ICY,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:43:41 2015 UTC,Well said.
ShrekSuperSlam,3bmlys,BoastingToast,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:17:05 2015 UTC,"I guess they could be used for the occasional mix up but otherwise probably not. You can stall out with wall jumps quite well, especially if you play a character with three jumps. Good for avoiding slams."

ShrekSuperSlam,3bcipo,peppermint1201,3,Sat Jun 27 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"At this moment the subreddit consists of 239 people.  Many people see g-nome as B tier according to the index, but anyone who says the character is garbage has simply not played g-nome to its core enough to have a reliable statement.  What im trying to say is that the reason g-nome is considered low-tier is because we have no developed meta for g-nome yet, so people put him low tier. If you believe that hes a A+/S- tier contender (which i believe so), now is the best time to put time and effort into a character to show you are a reliable resource when it comes to the tier list."
