It was hard to avoid the passive aggressive tone thing so I specified why I posted it and who I was referring to but made no FB name links (apart from scubahana shared Name's link) so she would t have all that cascading down her wall.

They don't last very long, maybe a minute? They come and go. It makes me feel like I'm squeezing all my abdominal muscles but I can't relax them, then it fades."

BreakingBumps,3d5kp6,boringusername,7,Mon Jul 13 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"I've had one. It wasn't terrible, but the recovery was a pain in the ass. Getting in and out of bed was a struggle, and I was restricted to no heavy lifting (nothing heavier than my son) and no driving. For 6 weeks.    I do NOT want another one. My son will be just shy of 2 when his brother's due, and he's already 12kg. The ""no lifting"" thing will be a killer if I have a second C."
BreakingBumps,3d5kp6,not_just_amwac,3,Mon Jul 13 22:08:28 2015 UTC,I had a c-section. It wasn't really an emergency one but it definitely wasn't planned. I didn't think it was that bad. If/when baby number 2 happens I would lean towards having a c-section again.
BreakingBumps,3d5kp6,prinzessbohnen,3,Mon Jul 13 19:37:49 2015 UTC,"You may enjoy /r/csectioncentral.    I had a caesarean a couple of years ago. My water ruptured at 34 weeks and baby was breech so they cut her out. I only had one contraction, but after that the spinal didn't seem that bad. Not being able to feel my legs was weird. They closed me up with glue and tape.    I had to sit in recovery until I was able to lift my butt off the bed. Then I had to wear compression leggings for a few hours to prevent clotting. I started to itch from the medication so my husband bought me a back scratcher.    I insisted on stool softeners for my first poop. It sucked. But I took the pain pills they gave me so overall it wasn't so bad. I mostly parented as normal.    My BFF labored for 26 hours without meds, and her son tore her vagina all the way up both sides. After watching that a caesarean seemed like nothing."
BreakingBumps,3d5kp6,fruitjerky,2,Tue Jul 14 04:06:52 2015 UTC,"I've had 3 c-sections.  They were all different (and in some ways, the same) in much the same way that vaginal birth is different (and in some ways, the same) for every child.  The only thing that wasn't fun was the recovery period.  In the hospital, nurses come and go and push on your uterus to make sure to get the blood out, and that sucks and is very painful.  Breastfeeding is still really encouraged despite all the meds you're hooked up to and taking.  The first 6 weeks after was the hardest, but there are some people who really bounce back well after a c-section and are up and working with no problems, but I wasn't one of those folks and struggled a lot.  Taking a crap after a c-section sucks because you're stopped up from the painkillers but you can't strain - the third c-section produced the most painful poops I've ever had, but that's because I wasn't taking the mild laxatives regularly (a mistake I will be sure to not repeat).  The thing I hated the absolute most with an elective c-section:  having the meds be put in my back.  I developed what seems like PTSD from my 2nd c-section because the anesthesiologist messed up and I felt everything (this is very uncommon), and I ended up blacking out probably from shock.  The 3rd c-section I ended up having an extreme panic attack and screamed when they put in the anesthetics in my back.  I will probably beg to be put under for my next one.  My experience is NOT typical, however, and most c-sections run very very smoothly.  The things I loved about having a c-section:   not having gone through horrible pain in my vagina because that scares me more than being numbed well up and then cut open and stitched back together, because for the latter you don't feel much of anything at all.    I also loved the fact that there was tons of help after a c-section because people really get ""major abdominal surgery"", and you're not supposed to lift much more than your infant during the first month or so of recovery.  It's odd being awake and being well aware that your abdomen and uterus are being sliced opened, but it is also really cool at the same time."

BreakingBumps,3d5kp6,missnewreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:09:35 2015 UTC,"Definitely does get better.  My experiences were terrifying, but I'd rather experience those all over again than to push a kid out the natural way cause that scares the piss out of me."

BreakingBumps,3d5kp6,XBlueYoshiX,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"I've had two. The first was after 30+ hours of labor and the second was scheduled. With a scheduled one, there is a bit of panic the closer you get, and your time in the OR seems to take longer, but it wasn't bad at all. The spinal does sting when they put it in when you haven't had an epidural, but even that isn't as bad as contractions.  The second is easier as far as recovery because you know what to expect, but they both hurt (they give you good pain meds though). You have to get used to getting up -especially from a flat position. You don't really have to worry about how it's going to hurt to pee or poop. Getting the tape off the incision two weeks later hurts and you will panic about shaving down there for the first time (get your hubs to help!).    I'm not planning on any more kids for a while, but my 3rd is probably going to be another c-section."
BreakingBumps,3d5kp6,Astro_naut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you asked this! I had an awful recovery last time, a worse recovery than from a caesarean, so I really want a planned caeser this time to avoid the same thing happening again.  The only thing I can contribute is to get info and anecdotes from people who had a planned caeser, not an emergancy one, because the experiences are very very very different for each one. Everyone I know who had a planned caeser is really happy with how it went but I know emergency ones can cause a lot of angst for some women."

I'm applying to be a surrogate and a big part of that going swiftly is being okay with twins.  I've only had one in there :C is it scary? Did they have to flip the second baby manually? Does your body bounce back as swiftly as it does with one baby?
BreakingBumps,3d5kp6,Flitterbee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:02:51 2015 UTC,"My first was born via c-section. It was great! I elected to do it again this time because it was so great. My first one wasn't planned, it was ""emergency"" because I'd been in labor so long and they were ""concerned there might be fetal distress"" although there wasn't fetal distress yet. There was no way that baby was coming out my tiny pelvis though, so it worked out.   Got the epidural beforehand (highly recommend to everyone who has to go through labor). During the c-section after they'd gotten him out and were nearing the stitching up portion or had just started, I started to feel some slight twinges of pain (bearable, but definitely more than the tugging you feel while they're delivering the kid). I let them know, they gave me more drugs. All was well. I wish I had not slept so long afterward, husband says I was out for 7 hours because they overdid the drugs a little after I felt the pain. Whatever though.   Recovery was not that hard for me. I was in the hospital for 2.5 days, and while there I dutifully took my percocet right before it would wear off because otherwise ouchiness. We lived in a small townhouse and the bedrooms and only bathroom were upstairs. I had no problem carefully going up and down the stairs while healing. I even stopped taking my percocet on the 2nd day home, and although I had some pain it was not unbearable.  My scar healed very well, no problems there.   This time will be different as I'm older, this one will be a spinal vs. epidural, it's scheduled which means I have more time to be nervous, and I have already had one c-section, and that will make things a little more difficult healing-wise, maybe.  If you want, you can PM me sometime in September and I'll let you know how it went!"
BreakingBumps,3d5kp6,Caitir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"I had a planned c-section because I never dilated at all and baby was measuring over 9 pounds.  Recovery wasn't that bad - but, I had open heart surgery when I was younger, so I was at least acquainted with post-major-surgery recovery.  If you take your painkillers on the schedule - before you need them - and have a fair support system to help you those first few weeks when you can't drive, can't lift, etc., it's perfectly fine.  I will probably have another c-section with this pregnancy, because it's not looking like I'll be a candidate for vbac."

I was scared.  I was disappointed because I was really prepared for natural birth. My recovery was long and painful..walking to the house from the car on my first day home was like the last walk.  My supply didn't come in for 4 days. ..so I felt pretty low having to supplement. .I got tired of everyone telling me how I had it good and I should be glad it was a c...  But you know. ..I'm 23 weeks with #2, hoping for a vbac this time,  but because of my bicornuate uterus I will probably have to have another c.

BreakingBumps,3d3s5s,queen_crow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:11:32 2015 UTC,I LOVE your theme so much! This is one of the most adorable nurseries I've ever seen - definitely a Pinterest nursery. :)
BreakingBumps,3d3s5s,hotsy__totsy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:05:13 2015 UTC,Aaw thank you!! I'm just imagining the whole room covered in poop at some point so I'm glad it looks good for the time being haha :)
BreakingBumps,3d3s5s,DEEP_VEIN_THROMBOSIS,2,Fri Jul 17 22:08:08 2015 UTC,"Nursery? Lolololol We have a sidecar crib for our newborn and our toddler's has her own room. We are moving in September, so then I will be considering rooms for the kids. I want to do something that will grow with them. For a while the girl child and boy child will share a room, but only after boy child sleeps through the night and girl child is old enough to sleep downstairs. At this rate, none of these things I am planning will ever happen."
BreakingBumps,3d3s5s,sellyberry,2,Thu Jul 16 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I can talk about what happened last night... It was very successful for our first night trying, after he was asleep I put kiddo in the pack n play next to our bed. I still didn't get much sleep because if he fussed awake I'd have to comfort him back to sleep and put him down again but it was nice being able to roll over in my own bed :)"
BreakingBumps,3d3s5s,Pregosaur,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:10:45 2015 UTC,"Our nursery is mostly done (necessities are almost all in place, still waiting on the dresser), we just need decorations.  Money is tight because my hours have decreased a lot, so most of the decoration buying has been put on hold until I've stocked up on more important things like bottles, a breast pump, etc.  Babysaur is due late next month and I'm sure we'll have everything in place by then.  I'll post a pic when it's mostly complete!"
BreakingBumps,3d3s5s,bitch-ass_ho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"Man, I'm 28 weeks this week and have done exactly nothing. Maybe it's because it's kid #2 and I don't have time for anything? But holy shit, this is making me realize I have a lot to think about."
BreakingBumps,3d3aqy,Kittenfluff44,3,Mon Jul 13 04:32:01 2015 UTC,"I just threw a tantrum over in babybumps.. I feel the same.. I hurt.. Hips, uterus, back, boobs, head, vagina.. Pick a fucking day n it'll change. I'm not even half way.. How the hell am I supposed to make it to December?!? I feel your frustration."
BreakingBumps,3d3aqy,sweetg2136,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:27:11 2015 UTC,"Me too, everything about this pregnancy is worse. The muscle pain and backache is driving me crazy. I just want to be able to get up off my sofa without shooting pains all around my bump and I just want to stand at the worktop without it causing a knot in my back. Don't think it's too much to ask! I don't care if its caused by two babies in there, telling me that over and over again isn't fucking helping when it hurts to get up off the toilet...  Sorry you are feeling so crappy, I too am wishing this year away."
BreakingBumps,3d3aqy,sockalaunch,2,Mon Jul 13 07:14:30 2015 UTC,I've only got one little shit in here and it's driving me nuts. I can't even imagine the difficulty you must be going through then. But yea the shooting pains is the worst for me...   The only thing that helps is lying down but if I lie down for too long then all my joints start to hurt so I'm feeling pretty hopeless. Argh!!!

I have a double thickness tubular bandage from just under my bra to mid thigh, it has really helped my various bump related aches and pains. It does get a tad bit warm some days but the relief is much better than the discomfort!"

BreakingBumps,3d10bd,Scandinavel,2,Sun Jul 12 16:56:49 2015 UTC,"Ha, my husband tried the same but quickly stopped and said ""Let's save this conversation for when you're not pregnant."" I think I had just finished whining about my back pain, the dummy."
BreakingBumps,3d0sil,pregnantsuomeksi,3,Sun Jul 12 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"Sounds normal to me, my exhaustion did start to lift until 14-15 weeks and I'm still not as energetic as pre-pregnancy. It sucks but you just have to keep plodding through."
BreakingBumps,3d0sil,sockalaunch,3,Sun Jul 12 16:06:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the honesty. When I asked my mom she told me to focus on the fact that I'm becoming a mother and that should give me enough energy. Barf.
BreakingBumps,3d0sil,sockalaunch,2,Sun Jul 12 16:08:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's not helpful. Focusing on becoming a mother is what stops me from stabbing the idiots that the hormones make me not tolerate anymore. It does not give me more energy... PB&J's on the other hand are a great energy boost! And they help you sleep at 4am when you wake up with a hunger that only pregnant women and teenagers understand!"
BreakingBumps,3d0sil,not_just_amwac,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:53:28 2015 UTC,Barf is right. She should try telling that to us who already have kid/s and are pregnant with the next. I have to get my toddler up in 25 minutes and try to convince him to eat some breakfast.
BreakingBumps,3d0sil,agentfantabulous,2,Sun Jul 12 21:05:42 2015 UTC,Dood. You are making a person. Lay the fuck down and go the fuck to sleep.

BreakingBumps,3d0sil,MrsSassyPickle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:01:13 2015 UTC,"I would say it didn't get better for me until around 20 weeks, I remember around 15 weeks or so I had a night where I slept 14 hrs too which kind of freaked me out! I'm at 24 weeks now and finally actually do feel pretty good and like I have some energy"
BreakingBumps,3d0sil,Kittenfluff44,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:52:21 2015 UTC,Yea... The trimesters are fairly vague in how they really treat you. Your 'first trimester' symptoms could last only for two months in or until five months in. I don't think my exhaustion and nausea abated until week 15 or so with this one. Of course now (week 28ish or something???) I have a squished stomach and while I don't feel nauseous I feel like up chucking for an hour or two after eating or drinking too much. Sometimes I do a bit.   Hope you get your energy back soon!!! I hated first T with this one and my daughter but second is soooooo much better.
BreakingBumps,3d0sil,icanhascake,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:12:00 2015 UTC,I had morning sickness until week 16 with this pregnancy. Ugh . I think it can take a while for the placenta building hormones to abate. Hang in there and sleep as much as you can!
BreakingBumps,3d0sil,MrsCrapnapkin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:04:38 2015 UTC,"I was shocked how tired I could be during pregnancy.  The best advice I have is to indulge it however and whenever you can (read: do nothing else but work, eat, sleep).  Use up that vacation if you have it. I figured my body knew best and I just tried to roll with it."
BreakingBumps,3d0sil,MrsCrapnapkin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:21:54 2015 UTC,"I am totally shocked. Like my body feels like there are weights attached and they are constantly dragging me down. And my mind, Jesus! I can't think for shit."
BreakingBumps,3d0sil,missy070203,3,Mon Jul 13 13:05:17 2015 UTC,I started being unable to remember words at an alarming rate.  Some of that has lasted after baby arrived but it seems to be getting better.  I attribute it to the sleep depivation.

BreakingBumps,3csvq3,JennnnZeeee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure even an ectopic will cause an increase in hormones and a positive test so at least that means you don't have to stress? There are so many reasons for a late period, like seriously so many. Hopefully it's just something simple like stress or your body being a troll"
BreakingBumps,3csvq3,Astro_naut,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:22:25 2015 UTC,"Ectopic will still trigger a hormone rise so it will be a positive.  About the negative test,  i did my first one too early and it couldnt detect the correct ammount of hhormones o it was negative.  Took a blood test then and it said i was 11 days pregnant  (yup i definitely knew from the beginning) so  that could be it"

I made dinner and right as we sat down, I got hit with the pukes (3rd trimester morning sickness can suck it). After a marathon vomit sesh in the bathroom, I come out to him sleeping on the couch. I tell him I need to go lay down, asked him to clean up, he said ""I don't know where anything in the kitchen is."" Which is true, aside from the drinking glasses, forks, and cheesecake, he couldn't find a damn thing in my very well organized kitchen. Fml having a newborn is going to blow with that kind of support."
BreakingBumps,3crpft,MrsCrapnapkin,2,Sat Jul 11 03:50:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, if SO said that to me and I were in pregnancy rage I would explicitly inform him that he has hands and eyes, both of which help orient him to his surroundings.   I have told my husband that after reading some of the Crappy Husband stories here I'm clear on what will not fly after the baby is born. If you think it would be constructive, have you thought about sitting with yourself to gather your thoughts on it coherently and then sitting SO down for a 'now these are your coming expectations' chat?"
BreakingBumps,3crpft,sellyberry,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:09:18 2015 UTC,You know they just don't get how hard it is to be pregnant.  I think that is what bothered me the most during my pregnancy - that my partner could not truly understand how difficult it made everything during the first and last few months.  I hope he is more supportive after your talk.
BreakingBumps,3cpx1z,serpenttyne,3,Thu Jul 9 20:48:00 2015 UTC,"That's not fair, I'm sorry. That would make me stop taking tests until I was like a month late. I hope a sticky one happens soon"

BreakingBumps,3cpx1z,SnugglersMom,2,Fri Jul 10 03:45:13 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat. I'm so sad about losing those others that I have started gaining weight a little and now people look at my tummy and then look at me all hopeful. Then my RBF helps to deter people from asking me anything.
BreakingBumps,3cpx1z,fruitjerky,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:09:04 2015 UTC,RBF to the rescue. Apparently I am intimidating at work when people first meet me so it's preventing annoying questions.
