badtattoos,3dy0z9,SlumericanShitizen,8,Mon Jul 20 23:46:59 2015 UTC,"Ok so here's what happened. Names are changed to protect the identities of the individuals involved.   Chad used to bully this kid Chris in middle school. Called him all sorts of names, beat him up, stole his lunch money and all. Chris was called a ""puss"" by Chad daily. Unable to withstand the bullying, Chris had to be taken out of school and ended up being homeschooled.   Years later, Chris, now calling himself ""Topher"", gets into art school, get really good with graphics design, but drops out after realizing the debt he accrued will be monumental. Instead, Topher gets into tattooing. After 3 years as an apprentice, he opens shop downtown in his hometown.  Chad walks in one day fresh out of Navy boot camp, looking to get a ""Non sibi sed patriae"" tattoo across his back. Chad does not recognize the now-tattooed and pierced Topher. Topher remembered all of his days of bullying, and buddies up with Chad and shows him all of his designs. Topher offers a really nice deal, and says Chad doesn't have to pay unless he's satisfied with the final product. Chad agrees, and secretly plans to ""hate"" it in the end and not pay. Topher schedules an appointment a week away.  Meanwhile, Topher makes arrangements to move his shop across the country. He ends his lease, moves his personal stuff into boxes, and leaves only the most basic equipment in his shop. The crappiest tattoo guns, the oldest chair, etc..   Chad comes in on his appointment day, late. Makes excuses. Topher assures him all is fine. Chad lays down. Topher goes to work. 2 hours later, Topher says ""I'll be right back."" and goes to the bathroom. Chad waits a half hour and becomes suspicious. He pounds on the bathroom door, no answer. Sensing something has gone awry, Chad looks at the fresh tattoo on his back in a mirror in the corner. ""Your a puss"".   Livid, Chad kicks down the bathroom door, only to find that it opened no to a bathroom, but the outside. A hastily made bathroom sign was taped over the ""Exit"" sign. On the ground, a desk, and a book with ""For Chris"" note on top and a bookmark. He looks closely at the book - it's their middle school yearbook. Opening to the bookmark, he found photos of young Chad and young Chris circled. ""Your a puss"" scribbled across the page.  Topher smiled as he drove across the state line.  Yes, that's probably what happened."

badtattoos,3dqsot,elilovesreddit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"I'm right up there with the other user, Lil Wayne is a pretty good hip hop artist. I mean I get not respecting hip hop, it's an easy genre to poke at for ignorant lyrics or whatever you wanna be a jerk to other people for liking, but you can't deny Lil Wayne's aristry and influence within the culture. He may have not been the first, but take a look at skinny jeans, skating, boots, codeine, auto tune, Drake, sure Wayne wasn't the first to bring these into being but he is the reason we hear so much about them today. I think it's so silly to write him off as bad because he said he was the best, he has been very influential and there's no punchline and no explanation to offer when this is said ever. I live in Alabama so it just usually means you're a racist, but I don't go calling people that for no reason hell idk you could be a black guy. But doubting Wayne's influence in hip hop or turning your nose up at him for calling himself the greatest doesn't drain his endless bank account, unfuck those beautiful women, or alter an entire fucking culture back to the way it was before he got there. He changed young people forever and brought races in my area closer than they've ever been so I love him and always will."

Looking at getting a tattoo covered up, and the guy who tattooed me told me to just smother the tattoo in it, when I had read that tattoos still need a little air to breathe, so I was hesitant but did anyway. Needless to say, the tattoo looks like shit now and I want to get more tattoos but I'm scared.  No shine, you reckon?"
badtattoos,3dsgq8,Mugsh0tz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:41:23 2015 UTC,"Yea, they need oxygen. Also, I would recommend using Aquaphor for tattoos. They changed their ingredients a few years back and they included a few more unhealthy ingredients.   I like to use Un-petroleum by alba. Use it for two or three day then stop and switch to unscented lotion."

badtattoos,3d355f,callmeperch_mobile,10,Mon Jul 13 05:26:42 2015 UTC,There are elements missing on the tattoo from the original reference. The little drip marks. & the stars are too fat.
badtattoos,3d355f,Bound4Hell13,8,Mon Jul 13 09:53:37 2015 UTC,Seriously. The tattoo looks like it was done with a sharpee. A good tattoo of this would use gradients/shading to give the sketchy appearance the logo actually has.
