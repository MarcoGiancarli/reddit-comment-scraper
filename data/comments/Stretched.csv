Stretched,3e5w3p,RainbowSnipe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:59:18 2015 UTC,"I'm at a 0g, and every so often I'll leave mine out overnight. When you're at the same size for a while, especially if your jewelry is a little on the heavier side, your lobes will stretch some on their own. If you're not planning on going up any further, this can be inconvenient. In my case, I'm wearing stone plugs, and the ear I use for the phone at work is my ""looser"" ear. The phone tends to push the plug out the back of my lobe. So leaving them out overnight just kind of gives them a break.   If you're not confident in your ears holding their size for 8 hours though, use caution with this. My other ear really gets pissy if the plug is left out too long. :/"
Stretched,3e5w3p,jadefirefly,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:02:28 2015 UTC,"You can do it at any size, but I'd say it becomes important when you get to around 1/2"" and above. It really just helps to keep your lobes thick and healthy as it increases blood flow. Some will say that if your lobes are stretched properly than you can begin immediately,  but I usually wait about a month. I also like to feel out my lobes before diving into an entire night naked. So I typically start with about an hour of naked tkme a day and increase it 1 hour a week until I'm up to about 6 hours, so at 2-2.5 months after my stretch I'm going naked all night since I sleep 4-6 hours a night. I also didn't really worry about it until I was getting close to my goal size which is what I'm at now, although I may stretch 3 more mm to 7/8"". People who have stretched to larger sizes also have to worry about rolling over and laying on their ear which could cut off blood flow causing thinning or even necrosis and breaking. I sleep on my back and don't roll around in my sleep so I've never been too worried about that though.  This advice is what works for me, and only for my lobes. I typically do not ever sleep with my 1g outer conch or 3g septum out yet as both are still being stretched and are at small sizes still."

Depending on your goal forget about typical sizes, go to every size in 1mm increments. Never use tapers. Most of all, and especially since you got pierced at a larger gauge, make sure stretched lobes are something that you're going to want for the rest of your life.

All I did was leave them the fuck alone with the occasional light antibacterial soap rinse. Warm water in the shower will soften and loosen crusties. Do not pick. Ever. You're going to have to just let them cope and heal in their own way, some people take forever, some people are Wolverine. I can't explain it.

Stretched,3dwitn,Cool_Muhl,5,Mon Jul 20 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"The answer is a resounding maybe.  Everyones ears are different.  Some are stretchy and some (like mine) are not.  If you have any doubts go to your reputable piercer.  I went to my piercer up until 1/2"" or so to do everything.    Also a general rule of thumb is to wait three months minimum before sizing up.  Once again ears are different you may be fine before (although I always recommend just waiting out the three months) and you may need to wait longer than three months.  Basically your mileage may vary and you will learn what you can and can't do pretty quick, but just some stuff I have learned.  1) I highly recommend stretching with glass plugs, they are awesome, hypoallergenic and tend to be easier to slide in than other materials.  Other options aside from glass are titainium and 316L ASTM F138 Stainless steel.  I have had the best results with those materials and they tend to be the general recommendations.  2) Avoid acrylic.  Seriously it is terrible especially for stretching.  I don't even like it in healed ears.  It is very porous and your ears will hate you.  I tend to avoid plastics altogether.  3)Wait three months.  This is more to err on the side of caution, but it pretty much guarantees that your ears will be ready to stretch up to the next size.  4)  Invest in jojoba/emu oil.  Either is fine a lot of people prefer emu oil as it is super good for your skin.  Lastly to answer your actual questions.  You can try purchasing the 14g plugs and getting them in the natural way, if you have difficulty go to your piercer.   Wait the three months."
Stretched,3dwitn,jbrown5217,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:53:00 2015 UTC,The natural way   Is that without a taper?
Stretched,3dwitn,Rigamortis_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:34:30 2015 UTC,Yea.  You let the weight of your plugs help to stretch your lobes and eventually they will be loose enough to pop the next size in.  Like I said your milage may vary as everones ears are different.  Edit:  Also please don't mistake natural stretching with using ear weights to stretch.  Using weights is going to create a thin spot.
Stretched,3dwitn,jbrown5217,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:45:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the info! I currently have Glassware Studios' glass plugs in my ears and love them, so I'm definetly getting more for my next stretch.   I decided that I'm going to stretch every quarter of the year just to be safe. I'd rather bide my time than have messed up ears.   I hate to bog you down with more questions, but how exactly does the taping method work? I think I'm going to avoid tapers all the way and just tape my way up, but there hasn't been a clear cut tutorial that I've managed to fine yet. Do you have any tips?"
Stretched,3dwitn,jbrown5217,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:24 2015 UTC,"The traditional way of taping is to grab ptfe/bondage tape and apply 1 to 2 layers every week or 2 (making sure to oil the tape once it is on the plugs) and then when the size of your old plugs  with tape is roughly the same size as you new plugs, oil up your new plugs and then slide them in your ears.  I like to use a lot of oil when taping personally prevents your ears from drying out."
Stretched,3dwitn,Rigamortis_,2,Mon Jul 20 21:41:11 2015 UTC,I've wondered the same. I'm at 16g too.   The piercer I went to told me to wait 4-6 months to heal and stretch.
Stretched,3dwitn,TotalMelancholy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:18:48 2015 UTC,"dead stretching is fairly easy at the smaller sizes provided you take care of your ears, use safe materials (no acrylic!), and wait long enough to let them heal. at those sizes I'd say you can safely size up after a month of healing, however everybody is different so it could take a bit longer, just don't ever force the next size in.   If you can size up without tapers with no pain and no need to force them in then go for it."
Stretched,3dwitn,TreyN7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:41:48 2015 UTC,"id say yes. start taping at 4-6mm. or dead stretching at 4-6mm if that's what you want to do, I find dead stretching doesn't really work well until 1/2 area personally, but you may be different."

Stretched,3drxm0,noshoes-noworries,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:19:09 2015 UTC,Tea tree oil? I thought that was a big no no when it comes to using on ears. I use jojoba oil or vitamin e oil. How are you liking the coconut oil?
Stretched,3drxm0,Aimes25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:43:33 2015 UTC,"I have never heard that before. The chemicals in tea tree oil kill bacteria and fungus, and reduce allergic skin reactions. I use it for all of my piercings, along with any insect bites or burns. It's good for your skin.  I love the coconut oil. It keeps my ears from being dry. I also use it all over my body (arms, legs, feet, hands)."

My lefts lobe was really swollen and tender but it's gone completely back to normal now.   I'm nearly certain it will go back to normal after putting plugs you know are safe in. Simply clean your piercing daily and wait 2-3 days. If that doesn't help, I'd use some oil. Keep it light and a little farther for the piercing since you don't want it oil in a hurting piercing.  And if all else fails I'd say downsize. It seems like it would be unnecessary after having your ears at this size for so long, but it helps with a lot of the issues people have concerning swelling and soreness."

And acrylics are bad and tapers aren't jewelry.    But seriously.  Most of the hard and fast ""rules"" are there in the beginning to keep you from hurting yourself before you know better.  If sea salt soaks help you, do them.  Try taping.  If your ears react badly, stop it.  Honestly, if you want to put acrylic in fully healed ears a few days a month, it's pretty much fine as long as they don't react.  I pretty much stick by the rule of thumb of ""no pain, no pain"" when it comes to stretching--if it doesn't seem to hurt you, don't worry about it.    Unless, of course, you're wearing tapers as jewelry. Some things are just wrong."

Thats a pretty big stretch, and I personally prefer to just stretch myself because I know my body's limits better than a piercer does. If you go size by size once a month you'll be safe. Stuff online is risky I guess but theres plenty of good stuff as long as you don't buy potentially unsafe materials like acrylic. I'd recommend bodyartforms.com"
Stretched,3dofzu,rpgoof,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:25:02 2015 UTC,I thought you were supposed to wait every three months between stretches?
Stretched,3dofzu,Cool_Muhl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:12:02 2015 UTC,Thats fine if you wanna stay on the extra safe side. Below 10g the stretches are pretty small though so many people dont really have problems skipping sizes even. 1-3 months tends to be the safe zone but everyone is different. I think most importantly you should listen to your body and with experience youll just know when youre ready. Above 00g I was able to go up 1mm every 6-8 weeks naturally without tapers or tape.
Stretched,3dofzu,rpgoof,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:04:18 2015 UTC,"I waited 2 weeks between sizes, and as they got larger I waited an extra week."
Stretched,3dofzu,noshoes-noworries,2,Mon Jul 20 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"I'm a piercer.  I wouldn't recommend jumping from an 18g (what you were probably pierced with, although I've pierced many people, usually males, at 14 or 12s) to a 10. If you take things slow, and you are smart about stretching, your ears wont end up looking funky. Don't make such a huge jump. If anything, since they've been pierced for a whilw, they may be loose enough to go down to maybe a 14. Mine was at 7/16th of an inch when I stopped stretching. They are back to normal now after a year or two of letting them shrink. I skipped sizes and rushed and my ears look like little puckered cat butt holes. If you don't rush and you don't skip sizes yours will be fine and there will be no pain. If anything, just tightness."
Stretched,3dofzu,jaynarg,2,Sat Jul 18 06:39:27 2015 UTC,I bought a stretching kit off of Amazon. it came all pre-packaged and sealed. I stabilized everything before use and it worked out pretty well for me. It was a lot cheaper than going to a parlor and buying individual gauge sizes.
Stretched,3dofzu,noshoes-noworries,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:27:17 2015 UTC,"If you are only stretching to 10g or 8g, you can do it slowly on your own. Fiddling with the jewelry will help to naturally stretch the hole, and in theory, you can do it without discomfort. My 2nds are currently a 10g just from wearing CBRs and fiddling with them over time."
Stretched,3dofzu,badbluemoon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:45:41 2015 UTC,I pierced myself at a 14g when I was 18 and jumped to a 10g with a little ptfe tape on my jewelry. I've bought 99% of my jewelry on ebay and I've never had an issue with the quality of product I've received.
Stretched,3dofzu,CrunchyPancakes,0,Sat Jul 18 21:19:40 2015 UTC,If you do it right stretching doesn't hurt. At all. At 10g if you're female people won't even be able to tell if you've stretched your ears unless you wear tunnels.   Most people's ears won't fully heal if you go past a 2g. Staying smaller than a 4g is pretty safe. As long as you don't stretch too fast you won't further damage your ears.   Another thing to consider- I had my lobe pierced before I wanted to stretch. The piercing wasn't placed right to be stretched. You may want to have a piercer check it out so that you're sure you won't have an offcenter piercing.
Stretched,3doqtg,Rigamortis_,3,Sat Jul 18 00:33:05 2015 UTC,"The best way is to get pierced at about a 8g and stretch slowly from there. You can get pierced at a lower gauge but it'll probably hurt a ton (getting pierced at 8g is already going to hurt a bit), but 8g is a good starting point."

Stretched,3doqtg,quack_quack_moo,2,Sat Jul 18 04:02:18 2015 UTC,"""Standard"" jewelry is 18g.  Everyone on here advises against using acrylic jewelry because of its porosity and ability to hold bacteria, but my ears did fine with it. I got a kit on amazon that went from 14-00. Do some research, and see what you're comfortable doing. You can always buy a nice set of glass jewelry in each size that you like and take your time. Your ears will love you for it and there's no healthier way of stretching than a dead stretch. Slower stretching will allow your ears to rebuild cells and grow more collagen, making them healthier in the long run.  My ears stretched FAST and are healthy and fine, but everyone's genetics are different. Just be careful whatever path you choose, as some screw-ups can only be fixed with surgery."

Stretched,3dgd55,ohnards,10,Thu Jul 16 01:36:14 2015 UTC,Go to 1g first or use PTFE tape to size up
Stretched,3dgd55,rpgoof,8,Thu Jul 16 02:33:29 2015 UTC,wtf is with the dumbasses in the comments. get 1g plugs or tape with either bondage tape or PTFE Tape. no others.
Stretched,3dgd55,TreyN7,2,Thu Jul 16 04:04:14 2015 UTC,"The gap from 2g to 0g is way out of proportion compared to the other size gaps. 4g to 2g is big enough, at a full millimeter, while what you're trying to attempt is 2mm. Your case is only expected. It's surprising to me when someone can make the jump with no problem. I'm currently at a 1g. Perfect dead stretch. Try that. Head to bodyartforms and order some glass ones. Much easier on your lobes."
Stretched,3dgd55,GizmoMachine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:33:29 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be that guy but I was at a 2g for about 3 months until I was able to dead stretch to a 0g with no problem, my ears are like rubber bands...."

I try to be overly cautious with my ears now after messing them up in the past. They're perfectly healed now, but blowouts are painful and upsetting. I was just giving that advice so that OP could avoid the same issues."
Stretched,3dgd55,GizmoMachine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:33:28 2015 UTC,"Why are you skipping 1g? One of the cardinal rules of stretching is not to skip a size, you're risking blowouts and infection. Being patient and allowing your lobes to adjust to each and every size is going to pay off undoubtedly every time, sizing up faster might save you time but could cause damage."
Stretched,3dgd55,ladydeathofmurdermt,4,Thu Jul 16 11:19:50 2015 UTC,Most people don't go to 1g and probably don't even know it exists. Going from 2 to 0 isn't impossible or that dangerous.
Stretched,3dgd55,thewooboost,-4,Thu Jul 16 11:25:30 2015 UTC,"Okay so I had this same problem about 2 months ago, the way I got it to go in was: I had the taper sticking half way out of the hole for maybe a week, and one day, after being outside on a reasonably hot day for maybe 3-4 hours, I just started messing with it and it just slid in like butter. It didn't really hurt and there was no blood or infection, so maybe try that? After I put it in I didn't touch it for a 3 days and then changed it to a plug.  EDIT: or don't whatever I'm getting downvoted but it worked for me so"

Stretched,3d9zoy,RegularLunchBox,5,Tue Jul 14 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"If you're getting piercing that's around that size (4g~), it means that your piercer will pierce it with a larger sized needle, and then use a taper to pull it through the new piercing to stretch it. It is a lot easier to stretch a fresh piercing fast than to do that with a healed one. There's a video by PangeaPiercing on YouTube where they show the process, it's called 6g ear piercings or something"
Stretched,3d9zoy,SatanicBlowjobs,5,Tue Jul 14 18:00:44 2015 UTC,"Getting pierced at larger sizes leaves less ear lobe to stretch. Use caution. I've seen a video where a guy got pierced and stretched to 00 or bigger, but that doesn't look fun. Buy some jewelry you like at each size and enjoy the journey. There's nothing wrong with smaller holes. I started at 14g.  Take your time and treat your ears nice."
Stretched,3d9zoy,PCnerd73,4,Tue Jul 14 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"False. That's true for a punch. I was pierced at a 4, sitting at 9/16ths  and I look like I'm at a 00. Every ear is different."
Stretched,3d9zoy,Kat1yn,3,Tue Jul 14 18:18:07 2015 UTC,"Seconded. Punches and O needles remove a lot of the tissue but regular K needles do not. If you're 100% sure you want to be stretched and recognize it as a permanent mod than there are next to no dissadvantages and a few things, like healing, usually go better.  Do it op! NOTHING is wrong with going straight to those sizes as long as the artist is expierenced and has a good portfolio."

Stretched,3d9zoy,_metalalloy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:24:23 2015 UTC,If they really are planning on starting with a regular (20/18g) needle then I would look around at other shops. It's not at all uncommon to use larger needle like a 8/6g and taper up one size. From what I've gathered tapering up more than one size after the initial piercing just causes unnecessary stress on your ears and I wouldn't recommend it.
Stretched,3d9zoy,_metalalloy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:56:00 2015 UTC,I just got this done yesterday! Pierced at 6 and stretched immediately to 4. Hurt WAY less than I was expecting (just try not to look at the needle haha).  And I got to skip all the smaller sizes which saved me a lot of time and money. Some people enjoy the process but I'm glad I decided to get a larger piercing
Stretched,3d9zoy,_metalalloy,2,Tue Jul 14 18:36:39 2015 UTC,Are we talking millimeters or gauges here? Also what was the procedure? Needle and taper as mentioned above?
Stretched,3d9zoy,_metalalloy,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:22 2015 UTC,6g to 4g and he did the needle and then tapered to 4 immediately. There was blood but nothing too bad :)

Stretched,3d64rf,JamesGoodall,2,Mon Jul 13 21:26:00 2015 UTC,No problems so far; I visit my dentist 3 times per year and have never had problems due to the labret plug.   It's amazingly comfortable wearing the larger pieces when they're the right shape and curvature. I can't wear round pieces anymore at this size: it just feels so huge and causes my lower lip to protrude upwards.  I'm likely going to 19mm (3/4 inch) and then stopping. Anything bigger than that is crazy big (but I did say the same thing at 5/8 inch).
Stretched,3d64rf,rpgoof,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:59:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe a weird question, but do people ever think your labret is just part of the beard?"

My piercing hole is still tough and doesn't seem to get any better no matter what. I do massages with Vitamin E oil, Plugyourholes Ear butter and Holey Butter and clean it too.

I didn't get my ears re-pierced until earlier this year, (I'm 19 now) and I'm at a 2g in left ear and 4g in right. If you let them heal between stretches, you won't have a problem, at least I didn't, but everyone is different. I just had to downsize my right because it got sore, and it didn't seem safe to me keeping it at 2g in the condition it was in, and I was afraid of causing permanent damage.  I am eager to get to my goal of 00, but there's nothing wrong with taking it slow, and downsizing if needed. :) You want your ears to be healthy and do it safely, since it could be a permanent modification.  I've recently been doing oil massages. I use lavender essential oil, YoungLiving because it is 100% pure, I've read it's good for breaking down scar tissue, and it helps reduce redness and pain. I use it every time I stretch and it's a little tinder. It helps a lot! I massage that in my ear for about 5 minutes and then massage vitamin E oil for about 10. Keep in mind though, everyone is different, and you may not be able to stretch as far as you like. Don't force anything! Only do it if it's safe to. Hope this helps! :)   TL;DR Got my ears repierced after 7 years, currently at 2g and 4g. Do oil massages each night to keep lobes healthy and reduce scar tissue."

So ever since then I've had one nostril stretched. I moved to Norway from Indiana recently and found a skilled piercer and APP member to finally do my nose. But the original piercing to 6g was probably a 6/10 pain. Stretching was bearable probably 4/10 pain that lasted a week with a tender nose. Load up on ibuprofen if you can't take it.

Which was hard on a 6g plug to keep the bondage tape on but I hate tapering so I said fuck it and managed to get the tape to stay. Then I waited about 6 months for my next stretch. I tapered for the transition from 4 to 2. I had just gotten a throat infection immediately after and the urgent care in my area always gives me Norco when I have an infection, so the pain pills really helped with that pain.

Did it hurt or feel uncomfortable at all to reinsert the 8g? If so, you may want to consider downsizing. At any rate, yeah, I would do some sea salt soaks (and be very gentle with your ear!) until it heals."
Stretched,3czros,therest,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:53:37 2015 UTC,"I'm having the same problem. I stretched up to 4g after 3 months at 6. I have to stretch gradually over a period of two or three days because I have the least stretchy ears on the planet -_- The stretch went fine, my ears were great, no pain or anything. Then after wearing the plugs I stretched with I wanted to put in a new pair that I had been waiting to wear for a month now.   The plugs went through, but the back of my right ear (bitch ear) has this weird skin thing and the notch where the o-ring goes got hung on it. I got it through, but I had to manuever it in a weird way and it hurt by the time I was done. I let it go for a day in the hopes that it would be alright, but of course this morning it was still hurting and had pus around it. So I'm back down to 6g for another month or three. I can't touch my ears after a stretch without one of them trying to get infected. I don't know why I'm so prone, but I am.   The things I always do to prevent it is to make sure I sanitize my hands and my jewelry before I stretch, do sea salt soaks before and for several days after stretching 3 times a day, make sure I have clean pillowcases, and touch them as little as possible."

Stretched,3czhad,TreyN7,3,Sun Jul 12 17:57:31 2015 UTC,"It depends, have you thought long and hard and made sure that stretched lobes are something that you want for the rest of your life? Even if naturally stretching the answer should be yes, but this is especially true to large gauge piercings.  Getting pierced at a larger gauge is a great jump start to your stretching journey! Most piercer can take you as high as 4g or even 2g right from the jump (typically either would be a 4g piercing with a K needle with starting from a 2g being stretched immediately after to help with bleeding). So especially for a 10g or 8g you wouldn't want to punched. Dermal punching really should only be done on cartlige as it takes a big chunk out, and that would be a lot of skin to take off your love which could hamper future stretching. A regular piercing needle will not take out as much skin as a dermal punch of the same size, and that's why punches are good for cartilage and regular piercing needles are best for soft tissue.  I had my septum pierced at an 8g from the start because I knew I wanted to stretch it and it has given me a great head start. I'm about 6 months post piercing and am sitting at a 6g now, with my next stretch to 4g planned for the fall. By the time my piercing is a year old I should be up to a 2g which is very close to my goal. I would have gone larger with my initial stretch but I wanted good placement and told my artist to pierce it as large as he felt my anatomy could handle. Honestly, I did not notice a difference when compared to my previous smaller gauge piercings.  Best of luck on your stretching journey! Just make sure to find a knowledge artist, who's preferably APP certified, but most of all make sure to check out their portfolio before being re-pierced. Also, make sure that the artist uses only biocompatible jewelry (implant grade steel/titanium, niobium, 14k+ gold, or glass)."
Stretched,3czhad,TreyN7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:42:47 2015 UTC,I've thought incredibly hard about it. I would go straight to a 4g but that might be a little to much for me to start.

Punching is more of a second best because you are still removing elastic tissue that can stretch and constraining your future size goals. I had a lot of scar tissue from having my ears pierced multiple times and having to have an earring cut out of my ear before, and this method worked fine for me. Much better than stretching from my previous holes. Had my ears done at a 2g initially and am now at 1/2 inch when my first go round it took me 2 years to get to 6g. Oil massages work if you're patient."

Stretched,3c53ww,xXrainbowsugarxX,7,Sat Jul 4 21:43:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I had A LOT of trouble getting DFs in when I was at smaller sizes. Do you have a caliper by chance? If so measure how big the flares are, ideally you'd want 1mm flares so 7mm, and in that case all I could think of is to get up to the size of the flare, but than you run the risk of it getting stuck in there.  If you're doing everything right (putting them in like how you would fasten a button, oil lobes and jewelry, fresh out of a warm shower, and have fully healed lobes) than it just sounds like they're not ready. If that's the case than all you can do is wait until your lobes have naturally loosened enough to get them in, or if your lobes aren't naturally stretchy than you might have to go up to a 1g or even a 0g before you could safely get them in.   You do not want to force them in because they could get stuck, tear your lobe, or cause a blowout even. Some jewelry also have bigger flares than others. Like I'm at 3/4"" (19mm) and at this point I can get DFs in pretty easily, but one pair has a nearly 21.mm flare which is 2.5mm bigger than what my lobes are. I cannot for the life of me get those plugs in right now, but I can fit a lot of my other DF jewelry.  TL;DR- just give it time and don't force anything because it's not worth the risk."
Stretched,3c53ww,WhatevaWhatever,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:47:09 2015 UTC,"This ,  and if you like double flares and not the hassle of getting them in I'd recommend trying different materials like silicone and getting df plugs in any other material that have less of a flare... Some can certainly have even more than a mm flare and even that much at 2g would be near impossible... For anyone with tight skin."

Stretched,3c53ww,ididdrugsonce,0,Sun Jul 5 00:33:55 2015 UTC,I would use tapers they work really well and you can get good stretch relatively quickly and I'll use some stretching balm I found on Amazon when putting in a larger guaged plug it works ....hot water and just push straight  back  /wiggle.....success!!
Stretched,3c53ww,twonriley,0,Sun Jul 5 02:23:26 2015 UTC,"Concave tapers from kings body jewelry. The have an indented side so the new plug fits in. Their tapers flare out a little more so double flares fit easily. My first hole is at 19 mm and as I've been stretching my second it hurts worse, but I ordered an 8 mm taper from them and it was a pretty easy stretch from 5 mm to 8 mm. Their also pretty good length and surgical steel so that helps the process a good bit. Sorry about the shitty format I'm on a phone. The picture is taper and plug I used for the stretch and the link is the purchase page for the singles (they also have concave taper and plug kits which is a much better deal if you aren't done stretching I'm finally at my goal for both holes so I just got one).   http://imgur.com/PcfdumS  http://www.kingsbodyjewelry.com/concavesingletaper18g-00gauge.aspx"

Didn't realize the overwhelming urge to make my second dick hole bigger!!! Took out my ear's awhile ago and decided i wanted to do this next.

Stretched,3c797d,IIIPowerIII,2,Sun Jul 5 17:32:15 2015 UTC,You'll be able to get it back in. Don't worry about that. I was also pierced with a 14g about 10 years ago. I'm up to 0g with no tapers or helped stretching. If you are really worried take a warm shower and do it while everything is warm/wet. You will have 0 issues.
Stretched,3c797d,IIIPowerIII,2,Sun Jul 5 18:14:29 2015 UTC,Okay..... the piercing is 2 years old.. if that matters. I don't know how long you can leave jewelry out of the body before the hole closes or anything like that.

Stretched,3c4n13,dancingrilakkuma,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:07:29 2015 UTC,"If you have extra skin hanging out of the fistula on the back than that is a blowout. What size were you pierced at? 10g is pretty damn big to start at if it was an 20g-18g piercing originally. How big did you get in the past before stopping and taking them out? If there's not skin hanging out of the back, and it just feels thicker than you most likely just have a spot of excessive scare tissue in that lobe. Either way you should really downsize or take your jewelry out completely, and do oil massages daily until the pain/tenderness/extra skin spot is gone before slowly starting again, this time at a smaller gauge.if you will not downsize than best you can do is daily oil massages and hope that it goes away. Either way, best of luck! Just know that improper stretching now, and the formation of scar tissue will make future stretching much harder."
Stretched,3c4n13,WhatevaWhatever,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:02:14 2015 UTC,"My piercing was probably at a 16g before because I wore earrings all the time. I never went higher than 10 in the past because I just couldn't afford new tapers/jewelry at the time. There's definitely noting hanging out of the back, you can't even see it. I only noticed it when I was doing the oil massage and the difference between it and my right ear is incredibly slight. There is not pain at all except for when I leave the plug out for more than a few minutes, then when I put them back it will hurt but not a lot and not for long. I think I will try the oil massages for about another week and if I don't feel a difference then I'll go back down to 10 for a bit."

I know quite a few people that have stretched their lip, and every one of them is reverting it or getting dental work done because of it. If your a piercer, go to conference and ask questions. go to the classes about stretching and listen to people talk about how they regret stretching things beyond their ears and septums.   make sure you go to the dentist more often and ask them to check for erosion and issues that may have arisen from your stretched oral piercing(s)"

It was placed on my lipline, and angled so the jewelry wouldn't mess with my gums. I had mild erosion, but it stopped years ago and my teeth are healthy. My jewelry is comfortable, I certainly have no regrets. I wouldn't go past 3/4"" just because I like the shape of my mouth now.  At one point, I had to take the jewelry out for work. It was weird and I was afraid to eat or drink without it, but my lip naturally covered the slit and nobody ever commented on it. I missed the feeling of something in my lip, but my speech and whatnot was unaffected.  I'm 28 and work in an office with pretty liberal staff now, in a pretty liberal city, but the move was worth it to look like myself.

Stretched,3c064j,bigjimnm,2,Sat Jul 4 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"Great post! I was actually talking to someone I'm close with, but much younger than myself, about stretching cartilage. I have a 7mm stretched helix that's taken me a long time to get up this high. He's a afraid of taking his ears past a 0g because of ""the point of no return"". I urged him to seriously reconsider stretching or punching any cartilage. I'm not that heavily modded myself. I have a 3/4"" lobes, the 1g cartilage, 5g septum and ~15 hours of tattoo work mostly on my arms.  Anyway, especially since he's been concerned about taking his ears past 0g because he wants to have the option of them closing in the future I strongly advised him against the cartilage even though it's something I have and I absolutely love it. I got mine pierced at a 14g when I was 18, but didn't start stretching it until I was 24. I'm turning 27 later this month and I literally just hit 1g. I planned to stop at a 2g, but I also planned to stop my lobes at 1/2"", but I have the room and feel I might like the look of 0g even more. I do not plan to take it past 0g, but you never know. Even thou I stretched and didn't have it punched, I went into it knowing this was a permanent mod that was highly visible. Even when I was at a 4g I could take my jewelry out for extended periods of time and it never closed up or shrunk to a point where it wasn't a perfect circle that you could see thru. Unlike my lobes the surgery to fix my helix is much harder, more costly, and less likely to look natural. I never plan to do that, and I thought about it for years before I started. I want my right conch punched, my stretched helix is on the left, and have for a while now. My pierced requires a 3 month wait for anyone that wants him to punch them, and I've been on the list for 5 months now. I plan to wait at least a year before I take the plunge just to make sure it's something I really want for the rest of my life.  I feel like not enough people really think about stretching piercings like these before they start."
Stretched,3c064j,cookinshithatingshit,0,Sat Jul 4 01:25:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't know that stretched cartilage was reversible. there tends to be this idea that no matter what body part you stretch, as long as it stays under 8mm it will close, which is untrue entirely. cartilage tends to be permanent past 6g but that's not a guarantee. that only applies if it is stretched too, not punched.   people seem to not know what scalpelling and punch does. both operations REMOVE the tissue entirely, which won't naturally reverse.  just out of curiosity, what is the procedure used to reverse stretched cartilage?"

At my work, i am REQUIRED to wear plugs. Any unplugged stretched hole is a safety hazard. And thats where the talk of that ends. I work with guys with tattooed hands and necks, and I think I see a guy with facial work on the 3rd shift. This is the kind of work where if you can get the job done, you are pretty much able to modify yourself however you'd like within reason.    Again, this isnt a given everywhere, but overall this industry seems to be very lax on modified employees. I've been into tattooing, piercing and stretching for over a decade now, and receiving it for about as long.

Other than that, perhaps my anatomy works for a stretched labret? I can't answer that.  As for affecting my life/career, I don't feel that my labret is an issue at all. This mod doesn't really stand out compared to my 70mm earlobes, septum (I wear a set of 4 stacked 14g seamless rings in it), and extensive tattoos. I do live in a fairly liberal place (Santa Fe, NM, USA) and am from an even more liberal place (Toronto, Canada).

Stretched,3c19na,st0lenglances,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:44:44 2015 UTC,"Hydrogen peroxide and alcohol are both huge no's. They are too drying and they kill everything, including healing skin and good bacteria.   Your lobes also should not have been sore afterwards, let alone have any blood or pus. All of these factors mean you stretched too fast and harmed your lobes.  Even though you don't want to, you really should downsize. If your lobes heal at the larger size they are going to heal with more scar tissue compared to if you downsized and allowed them to shrink a little. Ideally you want the least amount of scar tissue possible, because scar tissue isn't as stretchy as regular skin/tissue and you're going to have a harder time stretching in the future, and have less of a chance of your lobes shrinking back if you ever decide you don't want them stretched anymore."

I do it because I need to.  honestly, I don't know your situation, but if you can't afford to spend 20+ dollars on jewelry plus shipping then wait. when you stretch on a budget you tend to make bad mistakes, like buying bad jewelry and skipping sizes.   what size are you intending on going to? what's your occupation? how old are you? and where do you live? is it a conservative or liberal area?"

Stretched,3bwtx9,TreyN7,3,Thu Jul 2 23:58:32 2015 UTC,"the smallest taping possible is from 8g to 6g. I find it hard to get tape around even 2g plugs. so getting tape around 8g would be impossible to me  I strongly recommend not getting stretching kits. when you have all the sizes at your disposal it makes the possibility of stretching too soon higher. I always tell people to get three pairs of plugs per size. a pair of stainless steel eyelets and two other pairs. wear the stainless steel eyelets until you want to stretch again, then wear the other pairs. it'll prevent you from stretching too fast. and when you're ready to stretch, do the same for the next size."

Stretching up a second, third, etc time will fly by compared to the first time so you'll definitely get back up to 9/16 fairly quickly once everything is healed."
Stretched,3bvow1,medaox,5,Thu Jul 2 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"I was going to say before I saw your photos that with glass pieces, there can be some variation in sizing because they're handmade and maybe that's why there's a size discrepancy.  It's up to you whether you want to contact the shop or not. For now, just baby them like you seem to have been doing. Keep them clean. You've already alleviated the excess pressure by downsizing, but continue to keep any eye on them.  In the future, you at least have a pair of 8g on hand for your next stretch. You don't have to have someone else stretch your lobes for you either. I honestly think stretching is one of those things people should do themselves. The piercer can't know if or how much pain you are experiencing. If it hurts, stop and wait to stretch another week or two."
Stretched,3bvow1,so0ks,2,Thu Jul 2 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I haven't changed the jewelry yet, I just compared sizes. Would you still recommend I change the jewelry to the smaller size the stretch back to 8?  I've always been nervous to do that kind of stuff on my own but if it's that easy then I'll look into getting my own set of tapers. What about the bondage/ pvc tape method?"
Stretched,3bvow1,so0ks,2,Thu Jul 2 20:31:45 2015 UTC,"Ah. Then yeah, put the smaller size in.  I've done tapers, tape and dead stretching. Dead stretching was the easiest. I just waited until I could fit the new jewelry in, and never had a problem. Tape was difficult at the smaller sizes, and at the larger sizes, I was basically using to keep my plugs in until the next size arrived in the mail."

That's just not right.  Definitely put the smaller ones in if you're experiencing discomfort. Because I'm dumb I went from a 12 to an 8 in one ear, no pain really but I can't leave the plug in because it's too short for my lobes. It depends on your ears if they can take it or not, my other ear absolutely will not skip a size. It sounds like you're doing a good job with the massages and washing, keep it up! Your ears will likely feel a lot better once you have the smaller ones in. Good luck with them!"
Stretched,3bvow1,WhatevaWhatever,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:19:57 2015 UTC,"With glass jewelry, especially at small sizes like that, there's bound to be some variation. The glass he used doesn't look like top notch quality anyway, certainly not Glasswear Studios or Gorrilla Glass probably Modfika or something. Because Pyrex jewelry is handmade you have to allow for certain variation in sizes, just like stone or wood. Either way he should have used a caliber before he stretched you to ensure they were proper size. If it's been 3 weeks already I would honestly just stay at the 8g size as long as you're not expierencing any blowouts, pain, or blood at this point. The best thing to do would just be to do oil massages on the lobes in case there's some scar tissue. If you do have pain or anything still than go back to the 10g you just bought.  Stretching is a really personal thing. You'll get to know your body thru the process especially at these small sizes which will make everything easier in the long run. A piercer can't really feel exactly how much resistance there is, if any, or what pain, if any, you're expierencing. I highly recommend doing further your self. I'd also invest in a caliber to be able to know exactly what size jewelry you're about to put in, they're less than $5 on BAF."

You don't want any resistance at all and it's good that you knew beforehand to try the in between size, and it sounds like the stretch was exactly how it should be. No need to push it to an 8mm and risk forcing anything, even though this was a breeze. Maybe you don't quite need to wait 6 months (or maybe you do since you will know your body better than me) but I would say wait at least a few months, maybe 2-4 or so to try to stretch again."

Personally I dead stretch 1mm at a time every few weeks/months and have stop sizes. Once I'm at a stop size I'll bounce around some. It helps keep my lobes nice and elastic, and for me taking my jewelry out for the few minutes it takes to wash my lobes and jewelry doesn't cause them to shrink at all. Just never force a stretch, and you should honestly be fine using this method, but of course everyone's body is different.  edit just wanted to add I actually take my jewelry out at night before I go to bed, every other night, and clean it with soap and water and give myself a 5-10 minute lobe massage with emu oil as well."

Stretched,3bs7ae,TreyN7,2,Sun Jul 5 03:41:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so ignore those other guys. Don't use cheap steel.   I personally used a titanium pincher, they're about $20~ a size. Glass would work too, though at smaller sizes you would have to be careful. I don't see $20 for quality stuff as being too expensive.   With stretching a septum, I'd strongly suggest talking to a good piercer first. Septums can be tricky to stretch, and you want to make sure there is enough room depending on how big you want to go. They can also sometimes take longer between sizes than, say, lobes."
Stretched,3bs7ae,Warholsmorehol,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:28:53 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with 316L steel as long as you aren't sensitive to it, especially for stretching. Maybe I'm biased because I started off with a 10g septum piercings, pierced by an APP member with an Anatometal Niobium retainer, and I've used economy steel septum bullet keepers as my initial jewelry for every stretch. They're only 316L and cost $2.99 a piece. I've noticed literally no difference between when I had niobium and cheap steel in my nose. Once my stretch is healed I switch to IS no flare eyelets made of 316LVM which is implant grade steel, and again notice no difference. I get the same amount of soreness (I exclusively dead stretch all of my piercings even my cartilage once the next size fits easily in), same amount of septum funk (I clean it twice a day so it's not very much except if I've been sweating a lot), and have never had a reaction.  Not everyone has to use implant grade steel/titanium/glass while stretching. I've actually had more problems when I used GWS glass in my helix to stretch than even cheap Wildcat grade 5 titanium (only metal plugs I've found that are single flare with rounded ends).  While I agree that 316LVM is much better to wear long term, unless you have metal sensitivities it's really not worth the extra cost, for most people. As long as the 316L is properly manufactured and has a good oxidation layer than your skin is never actually coming into contact with the nickle. Even implant grade steel still has nickle, it's just oxidated differently."
Stretched,3bs7ae,WhatevaWhatever,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:57:05 2015 UTC,"As long as your not sensitive to cheap steel, 316L, I highly recommend the septum bullet keeper that BAF has. They're either $2.99 or $3.99 a piece depending on size and they're actually really well made for the price. I've used them as my initial jewelry for every stretch and honestly swear by them. I've never had a reaction to 316L steel before thou, so if you have I wouldn't reccommend them. If your body is cool with 316L than they're a great option and the cheapest safe option I've personally found. They're not too long, but not too short. They're single flair, no O ring grove, and the ends are rounded.  If you want to spend a little bit more GWS' single flair Pyrex eyelets are about $8 a piece and they also work. I haven't liked wearing glass in my nose yet because of the risk of it taking a hit and shattering especially at smaller sizes, but I've used them to stretch my cartlidge and they have worked great. Industrial strength also sells implant grade metal in a solid plug that would probably be decent, but it's a lot more than those options, longer, and it has grooves for the O rings which means it could be irritating to get in."

But you won't be able to switch between normal earrings and plugs during this time, it'll be one or the other.  By the way, tapers aren't jewelry, and they'll fuck up your ears. Wearing them is a bad idea.  *edit because I referred him to /r/stretched... the place where he posted this. Whoops."
Stretched,3bmlkb,oracle_thedream,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:40:37 2015 UTC,Oh yes i know tapers arent something you wear i dont know why but i though it would make more sense than saying plugs or whatever?  When you say they will shrink to the point itll be like you never even had you mean they will go back to being just like a regular 18g ear piercing?
Stretched,3bmlkb,oracle_thedream,3,Tue Jun 30 13:47:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, understood! The term is just stretched ears.   Yes, most likely. Most people can go up to about a 0g and still have them go back to a regular ear piercing. At 10g, you can barely tell it's stretched in the first place. You have no reason to worry about that!"

Prices are alarmingly low across the board so the quality may be of concern. They also sell square plugs which aren't safe to wear. Whatever you do, don't buy their acrylic or silicone. Some people also have bad reactions to low quality steel, especially if it is colored, as the color tends to chip off. If anything, I would only buy their glass plugs, maybe risk it on some plain, internally threaded steel if you're confident on your ears ability to handle it, and get everything else you want from bodyartforms.com"

I'm also now less than $25 away from the 10% discount for life which is exciting. I love BAF, I try and support my local shops as much as I can, but it's hard when they're $30 for a pair of Diablo Organics I can get for $14 on BAF or $100 for a pair of IS 316LVM DF Eyelets that I bought off BAF for $54. Plus I always get my order in 2 days with the $4.95 USPS Priority shipping, and I always get a bunch of free shit whenever I order.   Anyway, hopefully your order comes soon and good luck on your stretching journey! Don't forget to get both 9mm and 10mm 00g jewelry! I'd also suggest maybe considering going to 11mm or 7/16"" since you'll have a bigger selection of jewelry since 00g can be either 9mm or 10mm. It limits your choices if you want exclusively 10mm lobes.  edit missed a period."

Stretched,3bih89,so0ks,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:55:04 2015 UTC,"I hear that man. Unfortunately I'm in Baltimore but most shops here use crap externally threaded jewelry. IF the shop has any selection of naturals they're always off labels. There's one shop in the area with a great piercer and he's the only one I'd ever buy from. Everything is implant grade steel/titanium or glass for starting jewelry. He has a GREAT selection of BVLA and NeoMetal, but also stocks IS and Anatometal as well as Oracle Diablo Organics etc. He even has a set of the megaladone hangers on display from Diablo right now. Really cool dude with a very nice shop. I try to pop in once a week to at least scope out his latest greatest and he's guaranteed me that whenever I'm ready to order to order my 3/4"" 18k gold eyelets that he'll hook me up for whatever Anatometal or BVLA quote him because I send a lot of business his way.   My personal piercer is actually up in Philly, so I'll usually make the trek up there whenever I want something done to see him. Daniel, my local guy, has been itching to give me a conch punch thou. He doesn't usually offer it in store, but once he knows you, and you've expressed your interest multiple times hell out you on a 3 month wait list. His rationalization is he's be afraid to punch just anyone that walks thru the door which is understandable with the quasi status of the dermal punch, plus it's not something that's even easy to fix with plastic surgery should the time like most stretched piercings. I have a 7mm helix already, self stretched over the years from an original 14g piercing when I was 18, so he's more comfortable doing it for me. BAF is just so convient and I love the sales they have. I snuck a fairly large order in last night right before the sale ended. I ended up getting a set Labradorite plugs from oracle for $13, they're seconds of B grade stones but figured wth at that price, a set of Industrial Strength 3/4"" 316LVM eyelets for $41, and a bunch of other stuff at some great prices. I ordered just before midnight EST last night, and they shipped my order at 7:41 CST today with delivery set for Feiday by noon. You seriously can't beat that.."

Stretched,3bf363,applauds,5,Sun Jun 28 17:28:13 2015 UTC,As you size up the blowouts usually get worse. I'm at 7/8ths and I had my first blowout around 1/2 inch. But as long as you stretch slow then you should be totally fine. I was dumb and tried to rush it
Stretched,3bf363,omgitstyler,2,Sun Jun 28 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"It could just be some scar tissue and not an actual blowout. It could very well have just torn, rather than the fistula actually being pushed out. Either way, your best bet (if you will not downsize) is to do daily oil massages. I prefer emu oil, but jojoba coconut vit. E or even olive oil will work, it's more the act of massaging that helps break down the scar tissue itself. While it may be possible for a blowout to go away naturally overtime, or from stretching further, for some people; others will see the problem get worse. There's really no way of knowing. 2g is only 6mm and 0 is 8mm right now you're at 3.2mm so it's not a huge jump from where you are, to your goal. But, it doesn't really sound like you have true full-fledged blow out, but rather scar tissue. I could be wrong, you know your ears better than I do, but typically a blow out would be seen no matter what, not only when you push on the front. Good luck with your stretching journey! Remember, you can never go to slow!"

When you try again, try starting with a 10g, or even a 12g. I think started at 6g was your biggest mistake.  And the usual applies after that; go slow, massage your ears, stop if there's any resistance, etc etc."
Stretched,3bctav,therest,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:06:45 2015 UTC,I didn't even put the 6g in though. I just slid the first 1/4 inch or so into the hole. I didn't apply any pressure at all and it bled. That's what worries me.
Stretched,3bctav,therest,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:21:45 2015 UTC,"How does your ear feel completely naked? Have you been doing any sea salt soaks? If I were you, I'd put in the smallest gauge you can, even if it's a normal 18g, and just keep an eye on it for a while, and then work your way up very slowly."
Stretched,3bcf7j,HoboPanties,4,Sat Jun 27 22:06:02 2015 UTC,"100% necessary? Probably not. Going to make your life a lot easier and keep your ears happy, healthy, and cooperative? Probably so. It doesn't HAVE to be jojoba. People just like to recommend that because it's relatively inexpensive, easier to find, and the closest in composition to your skin's natural oil, so it's a good fit. I personally have used jojoba, argan, and apricot oil, all with the same results, so as long as you're not allergic to the oil of your choice, go for whatever you like.   I actually just made the jump from 8 to 6 myself about a month ago, and I had no problems, and oil massages were a huge part of that. Here's a post I made about it."
Stretched,3bcf7j,hollyharlow,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:24:34 2015 UTC,Your post helps a lot. How long did you stay at an 8g/7g before you tried going up?
Stretched,3bcf7j,hollyharlow,2,Sat Jun 27 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"I was at 8g for about 10 weeks, then I taped for 2 weeks before putting in the 7. It was another 8 weeks between 7g to 6g for me, no taping that time around, but that was when I started being really attentive with the massages.   So, basically it took me 5-6 months to go from 8g to 6g. My ears are REALLY stubborn and sensitive, though, so it might not take that long for you. 8 to 6 is usually where it starts to get harder for most people, because it's the first full mm jump."
Stretched,3bcf7j,Krymzin13,2,Sat Jun 27 22:38:14 2015 UTC,"I like to dead stretch. I go from plug to plug with no tapers in between. It's a longer process, but I've stretched up to 9/16ths about four times now. I've use the worst types of oils like petroleum jelly to my new favorite coconut oil.  Oil massages after warm showers are a stretched hole's best friend. You don't have to have them, in fact, I'm actually quite lazy and only end up doing them every once in a while, but it does make the process easier and quicker.   Shea, almond oil, coconut oil, or a name brand butter all work, but I prefer coconut oil because I also use it as a skin moisturizer and hair softener.   As far as the 8 to a six, invest in a set of pinchers. Steel or glass is my recommendation."
Stretched,3bcf7j,soggybutternut,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:46:52 2015 UTC,"I'm new to stretching, so I'm not sure how exactly to massage my lobes. Do you leave the plug in and just massage around it with the oil?  Also, how long do you usually go between upgrading to the next plug size?"
Stretched,3bcf7j,Krymzin13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"I usually give my lobes love after a shower. I shower without my plugs, so I just rub my oil/butter into the lobes while they're still a little wet, give them a nice massage and pop my plugs back in.

Stretched,3ba1fx,st0lenglances,2,Sat Jun 27 15:20:51 2015 UTC,When I was in ceramics I wanted to do the same thing and I had the same concerns too. I asked my teacher about it and she said that ceramic jewelry like pendants and beads are really common and a lot of people make them and that they usually don't cause any reactions for most people. The jewelry would usually be sitting against someone's skin for hours at a time and it wasn't an issue. With that being said though beads and necklaces are not sitting inside a fistula for a period of time so like you said it might just be a matter of running a few experiments just to make sure nothing bad happens to your lobes!

Stretched,3b9u64,WhatevaWhatever,2,Sat Jun 27 16:00:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, they do. I was up to a 7/16"" before taking all of my jewelry out for about 5 years. My ears shrunk to a point where they looked almost like normal piercings, but when I got the itch to have them again I was able to comfortable insert 4g plugs. Right now I'm up to 18mm (11/16"") and have only been at it for about 10-11 months or so, I think. I just dead stretch when it feels right, never forcing anything in or anything. I remember being able to go from 4g back to 0g pretty quickly, and 9mm not long after that. I stayed at 9mm for a while and than hit 10mm before returning to 7/16"". I decided to keep going since I missed them and now that I'm older I'm committed to having stretched lobes for life. It's funny, at first I was going to achieve a certain look, and I was pretty much there with 5/8"" but it just didn't seem right to finish my journey so quickly. Now I'm slowly working my way up to 3/4"" and maybe even 1"". Right now I'm working on thickening up my ears. I had a little scare recently, where I thought something was wrong with one of my fistulas and that I was developing a weak spot on my left ear. So I switched to emu oil and started jumping around my sizes a lot, between 1/2"" and 11/16"". Turns out I had a little cyst or pimple developing in my lobe, which was actually a relief to me. I've gotten them all my life, so no I'm down at a smaller size waiting for it to finish healing back up before I work my way back to 11/16"" where I'll sit for a little while before finally hitting the 3/4"" mark. I've learned to be really patient now thou, and this sub has been a huge help. It's amazing how much advise you can get just from lurking and reading. In the month or so I've been doing twice daily emu oil massages and jumping sizes sleeping naked etc. how much my loves have thickened up. I was having an issue with my right ear stretching up towards my anti-tragus and rubbing against cartilage and it's totally fixed that issue and I can see how much more symmetrical the hole is now.  Anyway TL;DR- it's totally normal to be able to stretch faster the second time around, but do not get carried away. You can never go to slow, but it's easy to go too fast and we only get 1 set of lobes. The most important thing is to listen to your body and do what feels right.never force a stretch or re-stretch. If they don't slide right in, wait a couple weeks and try again. Good luck with restarting your journey!"

My experience in coming back is almost identical to yours!   I was able to dead stretch to a 6g almost immediately with some minor prep. Two days later, they wouldn't stay in. I was able to pop in a 2g (with no actual popping). 2g seems to be where my ears wanted to be, because they're giving me a tiny bit of resistance now.   Probably not normal or recommended.

I currently work in a large international fabrication plant, have a 2g septum, 38mm lobes, 2 nostril rings, and a sleeve, and the only thing that matters is if the parts are being assembled quickly, accurately, and safely enough.

If you do this a couple of times at each stage of stretching up, then you should be able to thicken them a bit. Plus daily jojoba oil massages will help. Stretch them till you feel like you should stop. If you don't like it, then you can always let them shrink back down to a smaller size.   Also, I'd start investing in in-between sizes plugs. I preordered set of glass plugs from BAF with the following sizes 8g, 7g, 6g, 5g, 4g, 3g, 2g, 1g, and 0g. This really helped me going from 4g to 2g."

Start small until you're sure you can fit the larger size - 19 and 20.6 is a jump in itself. Once you're comfortable there for a few months you'll have no problem interchanging sizes though. I personally go back to 1/2"" plugs (current size 9/16"") at times and its not a big deal."

When I first stretched I went to 9mm but I had a few pairs of jewelry already that were 10mm. After a few months of being at the 9mm my ears began to get stretchy enough to accommodate the 10mm without me needing to stretch them myself. I can now where both 9mm and 10mm comfortably and without any problems or tightness. I haven't noticed much looseness when I wear 9mm, either. So I would just wear your smaller sizes first like mentioned and then after a bit try larger sizes and you shouldn't have problems.   Worst case scenario is that you can't go back and forth and you'll just need to pay closer attention and be careful of what sizes you buy which shouldn't be that big of a deal. Or if it really bothers you that much you can perhaps move up to a more stable size. It's really just personal preference."

Stretched,3avce1,WhatevaWhatever,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:32:06 2015 UTC,It really doesn't matter. Different manufactures use different sizes in mm anyway. Like my helix is 2g and I have jewelry ranging from 5.8mm-6.4mm. Once you're healed you'll be able to jump around. It's important to remember that organics can vary widely at any size to to their hand made nature. Just make sure to start at 19mm (even 11/16 which is 17.4-18mm).

I'm happy with how my ears look right now, and they're pretty thick, but I just want to stay nice and healthy since I'm into it for the long haul at this point.  A lot of people actually recommend jumping around, massages, and going naked as much as you can not only to thicken your lobes and make them more elastic, but just to keep them nice and healthy. The only damage you could really do is going up to a bigger mm size before your ready, so just be careful and you should be fine. Good luck!"

I actually just stretched up to 6g yesterday,  after being at 7g for a month. If you have trouble going up to 6g after waiting the appropriate amount of time I'd recommend getting some 7g plugs off of body art forms"
Stretched,3ar20y,Bellday92,6,Mon Jun 22 20:49:49 2015 UTC,Literally everything you said pains me. Wait at LEAST a month between stretches.
Stretched,3ar20y,brentlikeaboss,5,Mon Jun 22 23:14:31 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal. Even if there's no pain stretching at that speed, your lobes still need time to grow more collagen and fill in after the stretch. This is how you avoid thin lobes. Your ears may be very elastic and fast stretches like that may not hurt you, but if you continue doing that you will end up with thin lobes and a higher chance of them ripping."
Stretched,3aomxl,kashcade,4,Mon Jun 22 06:10:48 2015 UTC,"Ouch. I would just leave them naked for a little while and do some sea salt soaks.    I rested at 9mm, 9.5mm (just because I had some pretty plugs)  and 10mm."
Stretched,3aomxl,BumbleBeeBat,3,Mon Jun 22 07:16:41 2015 UTC,"How did you not see that they blew out until after your lobes were naked? Anyway, just do steril wound wash soaks 2 times a day for at least the next week, and once they've settled down a little (when there's no more broken skin) start doing daily massages with emu oil (emu is the best bet Jojoba works too, but seriously get some emu unless you're vegan or something).  Give it at least a month or two, or until the blowouts are fully gone and than at least a month after before you go back up. Once you do get back, make sure to go to 9mm and not 9.5mm or 10mm. If need be, go 9-9.5-10, but just 9mm and than 10mm once that's fully healed and you're ready to stretch again should be fine. My ears can be temperamental. My cartrildge can only go .5mm at a time, and I finally made it 6.5mm recently. My lobes used to have a lot of problems with with the 2mm stretches so when going up this time I made sure to hit 1g, 9mm, 10mm, 12mm, etc. now that I'm up to 17mm it's gotten a lot better and they're less tempermental but still. Like for my 5/8"" to 3/4"" stretch I'm hitting 17mm (which I'm at now), than 11/16"" (~18mm), and than finally 3/4""(19mm).  Good luck man!"

It's possible it's just a bit of irritation or even scar tissue and not a full blown blow out.  What I would do is put in some lighter jewelry, implant grade steel or titanium eyelets or something that has better biocompatibility and less weight, do sterile wound wash soaks 2 times a day, and gentle oil massages with emu oil, you can use Jojoba if you're vegan or something but in my expierenced emu is better if it is scar tissue/blow out and not just irritation.  If it doesn't get better in a week or so go naked for a bit and continue massages until it's back to normal. I'd recommend against wearing stone on a daily basis as it's fairly heavy even at those smaller sizes."

Coprolites are classified as trace fossils as opposed to body fossils, as they give evidence for the animal's behaviour (in this case, diet) rather than morphology. The name is derived from the Greek words κόπρος (kopros, meaning ""dung"") and λίθος (lithos, meaning ""stone""). They were first described by William Buckland in 1829. Prior to this they were known as ""fossil fir cones"" and ""bezoar stones"". They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms.  Coprolites may range in size from a few millimetres to over 60 centimetres.    Image i - A coprolite of a carnivorous dinosaur found in southwestern Saskatchewan. Photo by Karen Chin of the USGS.

Dead stretching, when your ears are ready, is the easiest and safest way to stretch. It shows you have them plenty of time to fully heal, and rebuild new skin cells. You'll eventually get the hang of it, and just know when you're ready stretch. After a month or so, I'll start trying to see if the next size will fit when I fit when I get out of the shower. Usually after 2-4 weeks with DF plugs in my ears are ready to go up ~1.5mm depending on the weight of my jewelry.   You're doing it the right way man. You should NOT start rushing it now. I'm not saying you have to stay at 4g for 7 months, but give it at least and than if it feels right just try to fit 2s in. If there's resistance or pain at all, just stop before you cause, and try again in another week or so. When your ears are ready to accept a new size, you'll know lol."

Stretched,3ac880,thatPizzaguy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:11:46 2015 UTC,Why loose the tapers? Should I be taping at this size or using another technique?
Stretched,3ac880,TheDumbCaddie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:00:35 2015 UTC,"Since no one else answered, while I haven't worn tapers, especially with the bigger sizes, they tend to create and uneven weight on your ears with one side falling back."
Stretched,3ac880,st0lenglances,2,Fri Jun 19 13:52:22 2015 UTC,"That's only when worn though. I think they're fine as a stretching tool in the small sizes(16g to around a 4g), and are definitely a good tool to help insert some stubborn jewelry."
Stretched,3ac880,bigjimnm,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:42:29 2015 UTC,"The technique of using no aids (tapers, taping, etc) is best since your lobes are naturally stretching themselves over time and you're not forcing anything. Ideally a stretch should be effortless like what you described it as this time.   If you want to use a taper for the 4g to 2g stretch, you can if you really want to as it's your own decision of course. But a lot of stretches after 2g are going to be 2mm instead of the 1mm or smaller that have been 18g - 2g. 2mm at one time is a lot for most people and it's very easy to tear and damage your lobe since it's a larger stretch. I never recommend using a taper for a stretch that's over 1mm, and even then it's a bit iffy since a lot of people tend to not listen to their bodies unfortunately.  When I stretched my ears from 2g to 0g, then 0g to 00g, I used the taping method which worked fine for me, or I would also recommend looking into in between sizes like 1g and such to make things a little easier."

Stretched,3a92dv,Gingerbredditor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:54:41 2015 UTC,You'll have slits forever but it will just look like a fold in your ear. I've gone back and forth like you for the past decade. One time I was at half an inch and went naked for a couple years and they could only fit a 0. You haven't gone big enough to justify the cost of sewing them back up in my opinion. Just leave em out forever and massage em with oil as frequently as is convenient for you.
Stretched,3a92dv,v3xx,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:34:20 2015 UTC,"2g-00g is the usual ""point of no return"", and 9/16"" is a good way past that. I was up to 7/16"" when I took them out about 6 years ago, and while mine closed up to the point I could wear regular earrings; they didn't look like a normal ear piercing. I was only at like 7/16"" for a month or 2, 00g for about a year before that, and I wore nothing in line for 2 years and they gradually shrunk to a point where you couldn't see any light coming thru them anymore, but if I wanted to wear regular earrings I had to really tighten them or else they didn't look right. I wore earrings maybe 10 times, no more than a couple hours each wear, for nearly 5 years before I started stretching again. When I decided to stretch again my ears could still fit a 2g, but I started at 4 just to be sure they wouldn't get irritated since that's the size that slide right in. By the end of the month I was back to a 00g, only going up in size when my plugs started falling out, which was about every 7-10 days. It went like that pretty much to 1/2"". I stayed at 7/16"" for about a month/month and a half, and than went to half inch which I thought would be my stopping point, but that quickly came and went. I should note that I have incredibly stretchy ears, and always dead stretch up to a new size whenever my ears are ready. If I want to stay at a size, I have to give my ears a break everyday for a bit so they will not self-stretch. I also massage my lobes with Jojoba or Emu oil every night, and have always been really good to them and followed proper stretching guidelines.  It really depends on your body, but in all likely hood your ears will never close to a point where they look ""normal"" again. You'll always either have some light shining thru, or slits. Also since you rushed your stretch in the beginning there's a chance you could have ""cat butt"" ears when they do start to close. Stretching should always be looked at as a permanent body mod, similar to a tattoo. Because you're creating new tissue while stretching, your ear lobes actually grow and get larger over time. Your best bet to have completely normal look ears is to take all jewelry out for the next 6 months, do daily oil massages with Emu oil, you can use Jojoba if you have an issue with using animal products but ime emu oil is just better, and than see how you feel about them. At that point if they haven't closed enough for you, or if you dislike the way they look, you can start looking into having them sewn up. It's really nothing to have it done. If you've ever had stitches, lancing, or a biopsy it's no worse, and is a simple in office procedure. Take the time to find someone, whether a body mod artist or expierenced reconstructive surgeon, who you're comfortable with and whom has a portfolio of healed loves they've done in the past   At your size chances are it'd be really easy, just a few small incisions and a couple stitches per lobe. Just make sure to take the time and make sure that it's what you want, because if you do get them sewn there's a good chance you'll never be able to have love piercings, and you definitely would never be able to have stretched lobes in the future.   Best of luck to you!"

Stretched,3a4ago,peachgin,2,Wed Jun 17 19:16:13 2015 UTC,Thats a good amout of time though. If you don't normally wear heavy plugs like glass or stone you probably won't naturally stretch your lobes much.

Stretched,39wpia,radialdesign,3,Mon Jun 15 12:36:21 2015 UTC,"one more  edit: The title doesn't make much sense, so let me give a little more info. They are 1/2"" Jet (lignite) inlaid with Lapis set in silver. The flares are Mayan style (so, oversized) and carved. These were made a few years ago by Onetribe.nu, and the design/materials were picked out by an amazing friend of mine.   Even more backstory to these, is that these are actually the second iteration of these plugs. The first pair that Jared made ended up going through some difficulties (Jet is incredibly soft), so he ended up carving red tiger's eye and inlaid it within the jet, and then inlaid the lapis in the tiger's eye. What happened exactly, was that he wanted to secure the lapis centers by drilling through the plug, and then having the silver in which the lapis was embedded go through that hole and be secured to the back. (If that makes sense, it's kind of hard to explain and I don't know the exact terminology for this style of securement.)   Anyway, when he drilled through the first pair to do this, the jet chipped a bit. He was able to save them by using the tiger's eye to secure the lapis (and the jet). The pair came out beautiful, but at the time, it wasn't what my friend wanted. The pair that I now have is what was made in lieu of the first; the lapis centers are secured with glue, which has held up fine over the last few years.   A few months back, my friend ended up purchasing the first pair that was made. Then, this past weekend, my lovely friend gave this pair to me... we were best friends in college, and she moved out of state, so we don't get to see each other too often. Plugs/stretching was something that she got into because I was so passionate about it when we first became friends in '07, so it became a passion we shared.  Now, she has an absolutely beautiful, one of a kind collection (mainly plugs from Onetribe of this caliber, though she has a vast array of designs)... I was there when she got most of it, and this particular pair was always one of my favorites. It's like a little piece of her that I get to take with me."
Stretched,39wpia,therest,3,Mon Jun 15 13:01:16 2015 UTC,That's really beautiful :) Your jewelery is gorgeous too! The lapis looks amazing inlaid like that. You and your friend have very good taste!

Sadly, my collection is down to a few pairs of basic glass, a couple pairs of wood/stone, a pair of luciferins, a pair of IS trans silver dichro and a pair of IS crystal blue dichro, and these.

Longer waits or half sizes like 7g can help make the process easier, which I plan on doing with my septum. I know I've done stretches like that in the past that have ended up okay but its not really advisable because you risk ""catbutt"" ears and a greater possibility for irritation and tearing which can really slow down your stretching process. After I hit 0g I decided to stretch smart, waiting 2+ months between stretches and each time the new jewelry just slipped right in without discomfort and it was much easier. I don't think the risk is worth it but its up to you."

Stretching is something you need to be patient with, you've only got one set of ear lobes.   On a side note, tapers are generally a bad idea for stretching, as they let you force your ears to stretch. Gorilla Glass color front plugs have a rounded post that is easy to slide in if your ears are ready (this is dead stretching and it's what I recommend people do), but don't let you force your ears to stretch.  Also, your friends are idiots, don't take their advice. Stretching should never ever ever ever ever ever ever hurt. At most, it should just feel a little tight and maybe warm. Anything beyond that and you need to take them out and downsize. I'm still dealing with my idiotic mistake of stretching too fast, and I don't want you to make the same mistake as me."
Stretched,39ydng,musiu,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:14:50 2015 UTC,"Damn, you suggest I go back to a 10g?

I don't want to blowout and risk going back to a 14 or anything.. but if they aren't blown out now, could I just be safe and wait like 2 months before going up again?

The closest I've seen would be something like BAF selling seconds on certain organics, and that's still like a 30-50% price difference, not 110%+.  That's either a ridiculous exaggeration or a total outlier.  But really, studios can't and shouldn't price compete with Walmart-style online stores.  That's a race to the bottom nobody wins.  Studios have totally different overhead and offer totally different services.  Most of the safe quality stuff I'm looking up on BAF right now is within the price of a Starbucks drink of most of the shops I've been in.

If it was a five or even ten dollar difference, I'd just buy the stuff in a shop because the price makes up for the wait time.

I'm not sure what size you are at but I think most if not all sizes are a lot cheaper compared to Kaos' website so it shouldn't be too expensive. If you go that route though make sure you don't select ""conserve plastic baggies"" because then they will ship both pairs in one bag, and like mentioned they may or may not do a return if the seal is broken.

Stretched,39pxsz,CHEZ_DOODLEZ,5,Sat Jun 13 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"Irritating the piercing by trying to force too-large jewelry in is probably what made it close up faster. Go back to your piercer, they can help you get the jewelry back in or repierce it. Once you get your current jewelry back in, stay at that size for a month or two so your piercing will be fully healed. Then you can stretch it yourself using tapers and oil, or get a piercer to stretch it for you. Never try to stretch by forcing bigger jewelry in."
Stretched,39pxsz,TheWildMiracle,2,Sat Jun 13 17:15:31 2015 UTC,"Forcing bigger jewelry isn't a good idea of course, but if you'd been at the size for quite a while and it's rather loose, the larger jewelry will naturally fit. I've dead stretched like that in both my septum and lobes with no trouble, though I've only done it once with my septum, I don't expect it to go that easily with the other stretches."
Stretched,39pxsz,rpgoof,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, of course you can dead stretch, all I'm saying is don't force it if it's not ready"
Stretched,39pxsz,TheWildMiracle,2,Sat Jun 13 17:39:51 2015 UTC,"It may have not completely closed up at first, but instead it could have started to swell up when you were trying to stretch it, causing it to not be able to accommodate the 16g jewelry anymore since the hole would shrink up a little bit.  Stretching a septum is a lot more difficult in comparison to stretching say ear lobes, and I think that trying to stretch it after having it for just 12 weeks may have been pushing it a bit. Everyone is different, but I have heard that you should wait a lot longer between stretches than the general 2-3 months that is  recommended for lobes. But like I mentioned, some people size up a lot sooner than that with no problems, while others wait even up to a year between stretches (but I think this is more geared toward larger gauges though).   I think your best bet would be to go to a good piercer and they could perhaps use a 16g taper if the hole is still open. With it being out for over 8 hours at this point though, it may have closed up completely or to the point of it just being easier to repierce it instead, unfortunately. I've had my septum pierced at 16g for about a year and a half now, and I personally can leave my jewelry out for about a day but the fit gets a little tight sometimes when I put my jewelry back in. But if you need to get it repierced you can ask them to do it in 14g instead though so that you won't have to stretch it at all, unless you want to later on again obviously."
Stretched,39pxsz,st0lenglances,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna find a piercing shop nearby and see what they recommend. If they think I need to get it repierced, I'll just ask for a 14g and have them turn it up to prevent accidents like the ball falling out again.  Edit: I went to a local piercing shop, and they reopened the hole with a taper. I'm sticking with the 16g until August, then I'll go back there for a professional stretching."

I recommend doing tons of research to make sure you are going to a reputable shop and to an experienced peircer. Sea salt soaks are great for helping your peircing heal, other than that it's just gonna take time. I have no idea about wheat germ oil, most commonly I hear about people using Emu or Jojoba. Personally I use Jojoba and gauge gear stretching balm. Jojoba is great for massages and gauge gear is more viscous so I find it works better than oil for helping with putting in new jewlery (when you get to that stage). I have also heard of people using holy butter, but I haven't tried it myself."

Oil massages are just as they sound. You can use a lot of oils, I use jojoba, and you just massage your lobe.  It helps break down scar tissue. I do it twice a day most of the time.

Stretched,399xdx,EmpressCaligula,2,Wed Jun 10 18:44:38 2015 UTC,I recommend switching to the tape method. That will allow you to increase incrementally over several weeks instead of all at once.

Stretched,393y4u,C_Lab_,6,Tue Jun 9 04:50:36 2015 UTC,"You should never stretch with silicone. Kaos Softwear even has a disclaimer on their website saying not to do so. Silicone is porous  (like acrylic) and has tiny holes all over the surface, and while your lobe is healing itself from a stretch it can fuse together with the silicone because it can grow into all of the small holes.   You still run the risk of tears also with using silicone as it's going to expand pretty quickly in your lobe and stretch it before it's ready, and it being soft doesn't make a difference. There's definitely better ways to go about stretching than by using silicone!"

Stretched,38ytgk,Cool_Muhl,2,Mon Jun 8 00:13:44 2015 UTC,"That's definitely weird for something as small as 16g. I'm guessing you didn't even need a taper to do the stretch because it's such a small difference, and having been there for three months, it's really unusual. I'd say it was probably the pillows that did it. I have gotten an infection from sleeping on my own unwashed pillowcases after stretching. I know hotels are supposed to wash bedding after each guest, but you never know unless you've done something yourself.   I wouldn't worry about the o-ring getting into the fistula. I've never heard of it happening, and I don't even know that it would be possible. It isn't abnormal for the fistula to feel firm with an infection. Mine actually felt a bit firm every time I stretched for about a day. If you've got a lot of swelling and pus the inflammation will cause the fistulas to firm up. You can always just take the jewelry out to be sure. It's not going to hurt your ears to remove the jewelry for a moment if the infection has gone away. If it's any comfort, my ears are just naturally not stretchy, so even though I'm at a 6g, my ears stay so tight I don't even need o-rings. I wear them, but if I ever lose one, I don't worry about my tunnels coming out because they stay snug if there isn't any fresh oil on them."
Stretched,38ytgk,LeannaBard,2,Mon Jun 8 02:12:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't stretch to this size I got pierced at a 16g.  Also I fixed the problem! Turns out you were right. My o-rings weren't in the fistula, it was just oddly dirty in there, and when I took out my jewelry and cleaned my ears out they went back in easy and now I need o-rings again to wear them to keep them from falling out.  Thanks for all the info and insight you gave me turns out my fistulas just happen to feel firm when I touch them also."
Stretched,38ytgk,WhatevaWhatever,2,Thu Jun 11 08:32:07 2015 UTC,My first thought reading all of this was that your O rings went into your fistula. Have a piercer check them out.

My second fav stretch was to my current size of 4g. I used the tape method instead of tapers for the first time and my original goal size was 6g so it was fun to be at a bigger size.

Stretched,38g4wy,WhatevaWhatever,2,Thu Jun 4 04:13:55 2015 UTC,"My 1/2"" stretch was the most exciting for me. When I started stretching again I really only planned to go to 0, but than I started fixating on bigger sizes. The only time I ever liked my ears is when they were stretched in the past. I had taken them back in 2010 after 4 years with stretched lobes, and they were naked 99% of the time until late last year. One day I randomly pulled out my box of body jewelry and decided to see what size I could still fit, and I was able to get a 4 in comfortably. My ears quickly stretched back, and I went up a size by dead stretching every time my old pair fell out until I hit 7/16"". I stayed at 7/16"" for a while, and than dead stretched to 12mm than 13mm. It was when I hit 13mm I was really happy to accomplish my original goal. My ears were the biggest Herve ever been, and look/feel a lot healthier than they did when I stretched when I was younger. I still wasn't too happy with how they looked though, so I decided to keep going. I'm currently at 14mm and they've already loosened up a good bit, but I know I'm no where near ready to make the jump to 5/8"". I just picked up some new DF Diablo Organic plugs which I'm really liking, and they have a nice weight to them so hopefully in a few weeks or so my 5/8"" will slide right in!"

Stretched,38fzj8,hollyharlow,3,Sat Jun 6 23:27:36 2015 UTC,"If your ears get angry easily, I would suggest dead stretching as opposed to tapers. I'm not one who is opposed to tapers in general, but unless you are one of the lucky ones either nice, cooperative ears that are ready to stretch in a month with no problem, tapers are likely to upset your ears. Get a pair of 16g earrings before you use a 14g taper if you do go that route. As long as you've had your piercings, they should go in with a bit of lube no problem. Give them 2-4 weeks before you do your first stretch and it will go a lot smoother."
Stretched,38gqrk,vindicatevictoria,2,Thu Jun 4 02:33:55 2015 UTC,"I would go to 6g simply because he earskins are so difficult to put in at these smaller sizes, especially in your septum.

I stretched from a 14g to a 4g over the course of almost a year using pinchers and than single flare glass. I now wear a Kaos earskin. The extra room is not an issue at all, I generally stack 2 or 3 16g in varying sizes. I guess there is enough room that they sit at the bottom of the tunnel, but you can buy absolutely tiny rings to make it work. They don't really move around very much either. My smallest one hugs my nose. I'm not sure why your piercer would stretch that so quickly but that's my experience.   One thing though. Putting in those ear skins sucks so bad. It usually takes me half an hour and a pair of tweezers."

Thanks so much for your advice though! It seems like you waited a while in between, was the stretch up to a 4g really tough or did you generally wait long enough that the stretches were easy? I'm used to working with the elasticity in my ears so I don't really know what to expect feeling-wise from a safe septum stretch."
Stretched,38gqrk,iamof,3,Thu Jun 4 17:18:47 2015 UTC,"Past an 8g I used half sizes, as the stretches started getting really hard. The stretches were hard but I didn't push it, if it started to hurt more than a pinch I stopped. I'd pull and tug on my septum after the soreness from a stretch went away to try and loosen it up faster. Mines never bled though."
Stretched,38gp8p,KREPharmD,8,Thu Jun 4 02:22:36 2015 UTC,"Some people's lobes are just naturally more stretchy than others. That being said, one of the big reasons to wait between stretches is so your skin has a chance to rebuild and thicken up. If it really feels right to you and you don't notice any puckering or thinning, do your thing, but you might find it wise to take more time if you can, just for thickness."
Stretched,38gp8p,hollyharlow,2,Thu Jun 4 03:18:25 2015 UTC,"I have big stretchy ear lobes, and for me it really depends on the size. I also have a bad habit of playing with my jewelry a lot, but only after being fully healed/lossened up. I also do jojoba oil massages nightly. I can't remember so much my initial stretching, but since I've started restretching my ears have been incredibly elastic. I've only dead stretched, and like my 1/2"" to 9/16"" stretch I did after like only 3 weeks. Usually once my tunnels start falling out and/or I can see between the tunnel and my fistula when I pull on the piercing I'll try going up. If I encounter resistance or pain or anything I'll stop, but usually my next size just slides right on in.  I went from 2 to 00 in a matter or 6-8 weeks, but my ears were already at all of those sizes. I probably waited about a month to go to 7/16"" and I was that size the longest, probably close to 3 months before going to 1/2"". Now that I've been at 9/16"" for about a month or so, my ears have already loosened a lot. I could probably fit 15mm plugs in with no problem, but I plan to go straight to 5/8"" so I'm going to give it at least another month probably 2. I'm in uncharted territory now, so I've slowed it way the hell down and have really been focusing on making sure my ears are nice and happy and healthy before going up especially for the stretches that are more than 1mm since at these sizes the radius can change drastically even with a 1mm diameter stretch.  Good luck man! Make sure to keep your ears happy, and listen to your body. You can never take too much time between stretches. If you encounter any problems when trying to go up, stop immediately and give it a few more weeks. Ultimately you'll be happy that you did. Remember too, at the sizes you're at stretching should seriously be considered a permanent mod, and you want to make sure your ears look as good as they can without jewelry.  They're really are no ""one-size-fits-all"" rules when it comes to stretching. I mean, theses some general guidelines like oil massage, only use biocompatible jewlery, and what not. As far as how fast you can go, that's really up to your body and you should be at or at least getting a point that you're pretty familiar with how it should feel when you go up a size. As long as there's no pain, or resistance and everything goes in nicely, easily, and smoothly you should be good."

Stretched,38fvm6,DianaMarie0717,5,Wed Jun 3 23:15:00 2015 UTC,Don't do it. Wait at LEAST a month before stretching up. It's better to be safe than sorry
Stretched,38fvm6,TheDumbCaddie,3,Thu Jun 4 00:04:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely wait if you can. I know the first few stretches go quickly and are so minor, but there is absolutely nothing to lose by going more slowly, other than not reaching your goal as quickly; however, if you push yourself, you risk developing bad habits that can cause you have unrealistic wait time expectations and to get rips and blowouts down the road, which will set you back even further than you would be if you had just waited to begin with."
Stretched,38fvm6,hollyharlow,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:23:42 2015 UTC,"This subreddit religiously adheres to waiting the exact same time between each stretch. The important thing is to listen to your body and not use force. At small sizes, the tissue doesn't have to adjust much, the skin is the main factor, that's why often stretching seems to go faster at small sizes.  It doesn't hurt to wait but if you HAVE to go faster than you should, just put in a taper and see if there is ANY resistance or even pain. If there is, just chill a few more weeks."
Stretched,38fvm6,Darkreidos,-1,Thu Jun 11 13:04:43 2015 UTC,"While I agree with all the other commenters, you could also test if your ears are ready/almost ready by gently pulling on them to see if they hurt. If they do, wait. If they don't, try sizing up but stop as soon as you feel any pain/resistance.  But I'm still new to stretching so I could be incorrect. Definitely try to wait if you can. It would be worth it."
Stretched,38fvm6,xohl,0,Thu Jun 4 04:07:08 2015 UTC,"I went up a size each week until I got to 8 g, which I'm at now. I'm waiting longer for my next stretch because I heard 8g-6g was a harder stretch. But, if you have any doubt about it, I would wait at least 2-3 weeks in between."

This time I was able to start at a 4ga and I'm currently at 14mm (9/16"") in both lobes, getting ready to hit 16mm (5/8"") in a bit, and 3ga in my left helix. I told myself I was going to stop at 00ga and than 1/2"" this time. Those quickly came and went. I don't really have a goal size set in mind at the moment. I doubt I'll go over 1"" but who knows. I'm thinking I might be happy at 3/4"", but I also thought I'd be happy at 1/2"". I have rather meaty lobes, so instead of picking a size to stop at I figure I'll know it when I see it. I'm finally starting to be happy with the way my ears look, so I'll probably stay at 5/8""for a while. 2ga is my goal size for my cartilage and as much as I'd like to make it to 0ga I just don't think I have the room to go that big unfortunately.  I got my septum pierced in April, and it's at least felt fully healed for the last month or so. I'm excited to finally be able to start stretching that in about a month or so."

Stretched,389rq4,hlarsenart,2,Tue Jun 2 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"I have a stretched labret; it's currently at 17mm, and I wear an oval labret plug. It really doesn't affect my eating or drinking or anything so long as I'm wearing a plug. I can sleep no problem without a plug in, but clearly I need to have a plug in during the day since eating and drinking would be a problem. The oval plug is actually quite comfortable, and my labret piercing is well-placed so there's no gum or teeth damage at all. I still very much like it, and it's actually an easy piercing to have (for me at least). I actually found it more annoying when I wore regular labret studs in it.  Although it is my most extreme mod (it's less common than my 2 3/4 inch, 70mm stretched earlobes), my labret actually is fairly discreet; most people don't seem to notice it -- likely because of my ears and extensive tattoo work. Or somebody who's known me a while will notice it, and think I just got it, although I got my labret pierced in 2007 and started stretching it in 2010."

Stretched,37t0yi,queenblackacid,3,Sat May 30 03:51:09 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest them to be honest. If the material is able to be autoclaved, its pretty tough. Not to mention, the whole premise of the size increments is the safest way to stretch."
Stretched,37t0yi,jjamessmithh,2,Sat May 30 05:49:37 2015 UTC,"I used them. I originally planned to used them as instructed, but they were ugly and were too long. If your ears are anything like mine, the rear end caps will be touching your neck and pushing your lobes outward a bit. It was better if I used o-rings instead on the back.  I basically used them halfway between tapers and taping. I put them in at 4 gauge, kept moving up in size after a few days (4-5 days, I think), put 2 gauge glass plugs in for awhile, then did the same regimen with the snap plugs to 1 gauge, put 1 gauge glass plugs in for awhile, then the same regimen to 0 gauge.  If they weren't quite as long and the front snapped pieces were just smooth (flat or rounded), they would have been better in my opinion."
Stretched,37t0yi,jthmeffy,2,Sat May 30 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"The material is safe, and I know Brian Skellie sells/recommends them as a way to stretch.  My only caution would be to take your time between the increments. If you get any pain or itching, anything that indicates that you've gone a little too quickly, go back to the prior increment and wait a little longer.  I think snap plugs are an awesome alternative to taping, and are less expensive than buying single flared glass. I just think most people buzz through the sizes more quickly than they should, and frankly they're butt ugly compared to glass or pretty much anything else."

New piercings tend to start to close up within a very short time frame (like within minutes typically) and 6 hours is a pretty long time for a new piercing to not have any jewelry. Even if the hole doesn't close up completely in that time, it will probably start to swell when you try to reinsert your jewelry due to irritation which will cause the hole to get even tighter. And you also run the risk of introducing bacteria since you won't be able to sterilize the jewelry before you put them back in.   I second the idea of a retainer, otherwise you might need to lose them unfortunately, as the risks are too great to try and keep them in my opinion."

Stretched,37jo7v,shymatic,21,Thu May 28 02:52:26 2015 UTC,"Lots of good info here. However, I would like to refute the point made about PTFE tape. I'm at work so I can't get as deep into this argument as I'd like, but for the time being...   First of all, no sources are listed so its tough to know how valid their information is. Second, these are piercers, not chemical engineers, so its also tough to know how deeply they understand plastics, manufacturing, and the differences in the same type of plastic throughout the industry. A lot of the things they mention are mostly true, but may not be relevant or are presented in such a way that makes it false. When they mention fillers, these will not be found in tape. Things like 40% glass filled PTFE would greatly increase some properties of the material but have absolutely no use in a tape-like material. Also, as mentioned on Wikipedia, the MIL-T-27730A specification for PTFE tape requires a minimum 99% purity. The infographic states tape does not have high purity or astonishing chemical resistance. Why not? PTFE isn't magically some other material when its in tape form. Also, when PFOA is mentioned, they exaggerate the information. PFOA is used in the manufacturing process but burned off after the material is fully formed. Miniscule amounts may be present in the final material, but according to cancer.org, it does not pose a risk to humans. Consider this - PTFE is a coating used on pans and other cookware. These experience high heat and contact with your food. If this is safe for cooking food, why would it be unsafe for touching skin? That argument makes no sense.  As far as bondage tape is concerned, I'm getting conflicting sources on whether its PVC, vinyl, or latex, so I can't really say anything on the matter. I do know PTFE is a much better choice than PVC though.   I could be wrong though. I'm interested in this discussion, as I had previously thought PTFE was the safest plastic available for piercings - even healing piercings.   Source: My university professor who specializes in plastics or otherwise listed"
Stretched,37jo7v,rpgoof,11,Thu May 28 14:59:52 2015 UTC,"As a Chemistry student (University level), I can back up this point. Due to US regulation, virtually everything that could ""POTENTIALLY"" cause any sort of cancer/condition etc is always labelled as having the potential to do so. Is it likely that you will get cancer from wearing PTFE tape in your ears? No, in fact, it's basically impossible, just as eating fish on a fairly regular basis will not lead to Cancer via mercury content, and regularly handling PVC pipe will not lead to skin cancer in your hands. It is also worth noting that many of the chemicals that they claim are added to Plumbers tape are either added in such small quantities that no harm could be caused or are only added to the sticky side of the tape as a form of adhesive enhancer, the risk really doesn't exist, although if you only read stats without any context, you'd believe that there was a huge risk to human health."
Stretched,37jo7v,Ne0nBlur,1 point,Thu May 28 15:09:42 2015 UTC,"If I might interject- the concern with these materials isn't just their makeup, but how they are finished. PTFE is an implant material, but implanted PTFE is finished much better than thread seal tape would be, even if it were readily available in medical-grade purity. With taping, you will also always have a seam to contend with which can be irritating. ESN fully supports the use of PTFE jewelry- but PTFE jewelry that is milled and polished to a mirror-finish, from a maker who has sourced their PTFE from a manufacturer who can certify that it is medical-grade purity.  It's also not that we're saying tapes will give you cancer; it's more that we're giving those details as context.   A material that is possibly carcinogenic is also likely to be an irritant. Perhaps not severely irritating in all cases (as everyone is different of course), but when we're advising people on what methods and materials are most likely to give them the results they desire without any hiccups, PVC, vinyl or latex tape don't fit the bill, and PTFE tape doesn't either. When there are safer options available, taping doesn't seem that attractive. I would advocate for the use of snap plugs before I would suggest someone use tape."

I'm sorry, but this literally made me spittake my orange juice.  There are some states- namely California- that at least pretends to inform consumers of dangerous substances.  If you have ever lived in or visited California, you may have seen signs like this. Unfortunately these signs are only required if certain chemicals or compounds are being used in accordance with Calfornia's Proposition 65.    Unfortunately, for the vast amounts of harmful or potentially harmful chemicals and compounds across the vast majority of the United States, no such warnings are required."

Stretched,37jo7v,ScienceAndTattoos,2,Thu May 28 15:17:23 2015 UTC,"The problem is that PTFE manufactured for use in plumber's tape isn't tested for biocompatibility. The manufacturers of this product don't use ISO 10993 testing standards and protocols to ensure that their product isn't harmful and isn't leeching cytotoxic chemicals. The manufacturing of these products also isn't tightly regulated.   PTFE can be safe for the body and is often used in medical implants. However, it's use in medical implants is as a mesh or scaffold to promote tissue growth. Silicone isn't recommended as safe for stretching because its porous and the same should be said for PTFE."

Iirc, the tape isn't implant grade, so it's not suitable for being inside a fistula. Also, tape doesn't have the same finish that Southshore Adornments has for their PTFE/Delrin pieces.

That's certainly a stretch in claim, we do use a ""special control"" grade with each, in simple terms these are filtered in their production of raw material. We do pride ourselves  (and if I may be so bold, think we have the best) on the polish of the jewellery, this goes a far long way in the wearability of PTFE and Delrin, may times when folks do have trouble with a material often the surface finish is at least the starting point.  I don't know what grades of PTFE and Delrin other makers are using, they certainly don't advertise what it is but I'm sure they may be able to advise on that if you talk directly to them.'   so it sounds like southshore gets a good pick at the litter of PTFE products, but there is no evidence that their products are the only safe PTFE product.  edited for formatting."

The difference is that the PTFE and Delrin that are machined from rods/blocks into jewelry can be polished to a mirror-like finish, and these companies are purchasing their PTFE and Delrin from manufacturers that confirm that there are no fillers added to these materials.  I can see why this would seem like a contradiction though... Think of it like this: PTFE is the material, how it is formed into a product determines its suitability for a purpose. Think of glass: your window and fibreglass insulation are both made of glass, but insulation would suck at letting light in, and a single window pane would suck to insulate your wall with."

Stretched,37jo7v,StretchySue,13,Sat May 30 18:37:44 2015 UTC,i like all the info but it honestly seems like way too many words for an infographic. IMO with that much information and words it would be more suited for a regular old manual/guide rather than getting cluttered in an infographic

Stretched,37jo7v,RogueVenus,6,Thu May 28 03:53:39 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of problems with this. One is the already mentioned chemical content of PTFE tape and their lack of clarification on the purity. Also, they fail to mention that people heal at different speeds. Personally, I heal very fast (not just talking about stretching, I have had large wounds heal in days that should have taken months). They talk about listening to your body and simply inserting bigger jewelry when your skin has loosened up. My ears would be able to accommodate larger jewelry after about a month and a half with no pain (some stretches took longer than others but I waited around a month and a half regularly).  I think people can get a little too obsessed with the ""1mm per 3 months minimum"" stuff and don't remember to just listen to your body. If you can go faster SAFELY, then do, if it takes you longer, that's fine too."
Stretched,37jo7v,RogueVenus,3,Thu May 28 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"It's the collagen, to give it enough time to regenerate to avoid blowouts, it's recommended to wait 3 months.

Stretched,37jtej,dontworryaboutits,3,Thu May 28 03:36:02 2015 UTC,"In general, people tend to recommend waiting at least 6 months after the initial piercing. Past that, I only stretch when I can do so without resistance. The septum is a bit tougher to stretch so expect longer stretching times. I'm still figuring it out myself though. Its looking like half sizes are going to be necessary. From 12g to 10g, I used a taper 8 months or so after getting it pierced, and I got resistance, but was able to get it through without any discomfort following that. From 10g to 8g after 2 months, I was able to dead stretch with no resistance at all. I've been here about 6 weeks and definitely cannot reach 6g yet."

My ears healed up okay but when I went to Costco this one time one of the employees called me a fag for having my ears pierced. I was crushed. I took them out in the car.

The ""ice man"" found in the Alps had them. Evidence of ancient people in Ireland had them. And of course, it is still practiced in parts of SE Asia, Africa and South America.

By 1999 I reached 6g and stayed there for a few years, and in 2002 I started stretching again with a plan of 0g, then 00g. Around 2004 I went to 1/2 inch, and in 2005 I reached an inch, where I swore I wouldn't go past. After a couple of years, my tunnels were falling out, so I decided to go just a little bit bigger.

Stretched,37cc9l,satan-says-meow,3,Tue May 26 22:33:56 2015 UTC,I was really into metal as a teen and eventually transitioned into more core style stuff where piercings were more common especially stretched ears. I loved how they looked and decided when I was out of high school I would get them.

I kept asking my mom to buy me larger and larger sizes, swearing to her poor oblivious self that it really was the same size she had gotten me the previous time. I did this all the way up to 2g. When I couldn't get ahold of appropriate earrings I used some really awful things…I particularly remember using the sticks from q-tips, and the clicky bit from the end of a couple pens."
Stretched,37cc9l,ParanoidPacifist,3,Tue May 26 23:32:07 2015 UTC,"My story was a pretty tame one. I got my ears pierced at age 14 with the intent of stretching, started stretching at 15, listened to my body and now have pretty healthy lobes. I almost got my ears pierced at 12 because I went to get an industrial piercing and couldn't (anatomical reasons) but refused because I didn't know anything about stretching back then (I wanted to back then, just hadn't looked into it).  EDIT: Forgot to mention how much of a big role music played in me wanting to be modified. At the time I started stretching my ears, I listened to primarily post-hardcore and metalcore, a scene in which being heavily modified is common. Even though I listen to other styles of music now as well as those (hardcore and death metal primarily), the love of body mods has stuck."

Stretched,37cc9l,blalokjpg,3,Tue May 26 23:43:50 2015 UTC,"I would fiddle with my earrings and eventually stretched my holes to the point where I'd lose studs if I wasn't careful. I bought some small glass plugs on sale last summer, thinking I'd slowly work up to them. Lo and behold, they fit without any extra stretching! I made it my goal to get to a gauge where I could wear organics in my ears because (as a pagan) I was really drawn to the idea of wearing crystals in my body. My goal size is 0G."
Stretched,37cc9l,shymatic,3,Wed May 27 00:18:55 2015 UTC,I hadn't really ever thought about stretching my ears till my ears decided to do it on their own. =D    I wore Diamond Studs in my ears for years.  Then I started waking up with the diamond inside my earlobe.  One day I woke up and one of the Diamond Studs was laying on my bed with the back still on it!  So it had fallen through my earlobe to come completely off of me.  So I thought what the hell I'll stretch my ears since they were doing it naturally anyways.
Stretched,37cc9l,lijkel,3,Wed May 27 05:46:59 2015 UTC,"I had my ears pierced. For girls, there are many choices that look good on them, but as guy, I'm not to fond of putting a butterfly shaped stud in my ear. So beyond stretched ear jewelry, there was not many other choice for ear jewelry beside stud or ring, and I didn't really like actual ring. With stretched ear have many choices, like stone, wood, plugs with designs on them. Best of all, my mom is pretty cool with it, she just doesn't really like it when I wear Earskins/tunnels around her because she says it weirds her out when she can see through my holes (but really though, that is my favorite part of my stretched ear)."

Stretched,37cc9l,Angrynevermo,2,Wed May 27 15:48:23 2015 UTC,"About a year ago (I was 16), I got my ear pierced for the first time. I was looking forward to it as I'd been waiting until I finished school. After a while I realised that the only piercing choices for guys are plain studs or rings, which I really didn't want. Then in September 2014 I decided to start stretching with a shitty acrylic taper. My Ma huffed a bit when she seen the taper, but after about 3 weeks she stopped caring, and hasn't said anything other than ""don't go too big"" a few times since.  Up until my last stretch (1g/7mm), I was using shite acrylic tapers and wearing them in for ages don't hate me. Now I use steel tapers to stretch then put plugs in as fast as I can and do all the massage and oil stuff.  A few of my friends had their ears stretched and I was quite jealous of them for ages and I just like having my ears stretched and being able to 'customise' them lol. I was also self-conscious (dunno why) about my big earlobes but having a plug in makes me happier about it. It's also a bonus as stretched ears really won't affect me getting a job in the future (web dev or software dev)."

Some people in my area have tattoos on the level of Lil Wayne. I think it's really cool. But, I never see people in my office park who are rocking that stuff.    I want to start but am concerned about whether it's age or career appropriate. I draw the line at tattoos so I'm looking into piercings instead. That's why I'm lurking here before I make an irrevocable decision.   Btw, I am not gothic, emo, or scene, my style is preppy mixed with urban.

Stretched,36o255,BakerELMT,5,Thu May 21 04:53:24 2015 UTC,PTFE and Bondage are the types of tape safe to use.  I recommend PTFE if only because you don't have to cut it in multiple directions.  Be sure to change the tape daily.

Stretched,36jlms,lasercrestwood,13,Wed May 20 01:30:54 2015 UTC,I was actually being serious. I stretched with acrylics years ago when information wasn't that widespread about the dangers of using that material to stretch. I feel for the poor guy who posted somewhere several years ago. So what can someone who is sensitive to metal use to stretch?
Stretched,36jlms,not_superiority,6,Wed May 20 01:41:37 2015 UTC,"I've stretched with acrylic, too. I got away from it quickly, though. Glass is always a good option, which is what I went to to actually stretch. I only wear stone or wood, now. I'm not allergic to metal; I just don't really like how it looks. Stone is my shit, but I tend to lose/break them much more often than wood."
Stretched,36jlms,not_superiority,12,Wed May 20 01:50:21 2015 UTC,"My bad man.  Acrylic is bad for your body because once it gets to about 80° it starts to break down. It releases chemicals into your skin, and in general, is real bad for any piercing. It's also got a rough surface finish, so bacteria gets into the little nicks in the wearing surface, and gets into any microtears that might have happened at a stretch.   Chances are, you don't have a metal sensitivity. This is a common thought among people with piercings. You probably have a nickel sensitivity. ""Surgical"" and ""stainless"" steels have a lot of nickel, because it's cheap to make, and companies like this also cut corners by using external threading and not properly polishing the wearing surface of the jewelry, which gives it the same little dents acrylic has for bacteria to hide out in.  In this case, you should try implant grade steel or titanium, coming from a company like anatometal or industrial strength. They make fine body jewelry that is 100% safe for anyone to wear, regardless of allergies or sensitivities. If you're a little wary of this, you can instead use glass jewelry from gorilla glass, glassware studios, etc. Glass is a GREAT material for body jewelry, as nobody is allergic to it, it's super smooth, and heavy, making it easier to dead stretch!  I hope that I helped. Sorry if I came off as rude in my previous comment. :)"

Stretched,36lx7d,MaggotStorm,5,Wed May 20 10:31:10 2015 UTC,Just rub some oil over your ears. The skin may have gotten dry and is gripping to the plugs.

Don't force them, I would try to use some oil to loosen them and they should slip right out, ideally. Just be patient and try not to sacrifice your lobes too much in the process."
Stretched,36lx7d,goldfish_poop,2,Wed May 20 11:35:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely was healed but my ears are prone to shrink quickly, it may just be an issue with the double flares. I think I'll just tease them for a few days to loosen them up"

Stretched,36lx7d,wxnderwall,0,Thu May 21 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"Did you just stretch, or were your ears still in the process of healing? This happened to me once, because I didn't know that wood is only for fully healed lobes. Don't use force or rip them out, because it'll irritate your skin and may cause tears. Take a shower to loosen them up and use some oil and try to gently get them out. This is what worked for me.   This is happening because wood is porous. Next time you use wooden plugs, make sure that your lobes are fully healed and that you're not putting them in right after a fresh stretch. Also, make sure that you use oil before putting them in. I always do this, no matter what material my plugs are. I use this, a mix of jojoba oil, vitamin E oil, and other essential oils that are great for healing and every day use. The tin was inexpensive and has lasted me well over a year. Plain jojoba oil, coconut oil or vitamin E oil would also work. The oil will make them much easier to remove."

Stretched,36b1ur,LeannaBard,3,Mon May 18 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"I deleted my last post and decided to repost this on a throwaway (I'm paranoid).  That's good that you're learning to stretching properly. When you're under 18 and supported by your parents, it's unfortunate but you sort of have to learn to pick your battles. The more you press the issue the more they'll start pulling support for you, then that snowballs into them pulling support on other issues because they remember you not listening in the past (I know from experience).  Now that one of my parents is dead and the other doesn't care, I started stretching my ears. I ran into a little bit of trouble at work though, they told me to stop at an 8g and not to go any larger. Here's the thing, I'm at a 4g now and they have no idea. I'm going to make the jump to 2g in about a month or so, and I've got black gorilla glass plugs in everything from 10g~2g, so honestly you'd have to take some calipers to my ears to be able to discern the difference. I can spot the difference between 8g and 2g in someones ears but to the untrained eye they're all just numbers. I don't want to be a bad influence on you or tell you to undermine your parents, but they may have difficulty really telling the difference between all the sizes if you're always wearing very similar plugs. At my job they mostly haven't noticed because I don't let them near my ears very often and it's sometimes days between the time they last saw me.

You should have gone from 00 to 7/16, maybe used 12mm if your ears are sensitive, then half an inch... with 3 months or so in between each stretch.  *edited because I was a little incorrect on the sizes. My ears are only at a 12 right now, so I wasn't quite sure about the larger sizes. My mistake!"

I eventually made it but a couple months to a year later my mom asked me to downsize and offered to buy me more jewelry in a 2g.

Stretched,367rhi,offendednoodle,1 point,Mon May 18 00:41:34 2015 UTC,"I've always been told ""bigger"" sizes should be done with taping as the best method. Most say 2g or 0g to bigger needs to be a slow and gradual process with the taping method. Some will say that weighting is an ok method as long as it's not frequent.   Like the other comment said, go from 00g to 7/16 to 1/2. Look up the proper order. I used this link to look real quick.  So either get the proper tools to use the taping method(wrap tape around and gradually add more over time to eventually reach your next size.  A lot of people just wear heavier jewelry until they can just pop the next size in. I know for me, I've worn stone plugs and can easily slide a bigger size in if I wanted to(I am happy at a 2g for now though and am enjoying my time at this size). A lot of people would just wear glass plugs(they can be a little heavy sometimes to wear constantly). Throw in some glass plugs at your current size once healed and when you can pull ever so slightly downward on the plug and see a gap between jewelry and ear, see if you can pop your next size in.  But seriously. Learn the order of stretches. That is likely the issue. You tried to go up 3-4mm in one stretch, when it should only be a 1-2mm jump between sizes."

One thing I've noticed is that my ears will tighten up exponentially if I wear wood plugs.  Like to the point where I'll actually have difficulty removing a pair of wooden double flares after wearing them for a day (I generally remove my plugs at night except when they are freshly stretched I leave them in)  Definitely going to give those glass plugs a try."
Stretched,366yq4,StifNippleScissorMan,7,Sat May 16 19:33:40 2015 UTC,"The only thing I can think of that you can do at this point is to remove your plugs/tunnels/whatever and let them shrink until they are healed. Make sure you oil them daily. Then wait another couple of months at whatever size you end up at before stretching again. When you do stretch again, I would suggest using the taping method as soon as possible."

Stretched,3635wt,cookinshithatingshit,1 point,Sat May 16 04:12:19 2015 UTC,"The illegality of certain mods or methods of doing mods is generally to do with whether the tools are considered ""Surgical"" or not. In lots of US states, there are various laws around carrying out surgery without a license, and often tools like Scalpels will get thrown under the ""Surgical"" name, regardless of what purpose they are being used for, which makes it illegal for someone that isn't a trained Surgeon or Doctor to modify you with them. Unfortunately, I don't know much about US laws (I live in the UK, where there are very few laws regarding any sort of body mods), so I can't really advise you where it is and isn't legal."
Stretched,3635wt,Ne0nBlur,2,Mon May 18 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the law is overlooked or maybe too generalized.

As for career aspirations, I'm an engineer and have a successful career. I've been to job interviews, and have gotten several offers, and my ears were around 1 3/4 inches (44mm) at the time.

When I first pierced at a 14g, I had some diamond studs in. With my natural lobe size, the studs looked miniscule and quite feminine which lead me to start stretching in the first place.   I've never been turned down from a job for my ears but at the same time, I haven't had a ton of different jobs to begin with. My current IT job is the second job that I've had throughout my life. My previous job was in web design so I was tucked away in a back office with my coffee cup and laptop.

Stretched,35vf04,bigjimnm,2,Wed May 13 22:38:56 2015 UTC,"I put in a 10 about Thursday or Wednesday last week. Which is weird, because I DID NOT expect them to stretch out like that. So I put an 8 in with absolutely zero resistance, just felt like putting in a regular earring actually.

Stretched,35vf04,PCnerd73,4,Wed May 13 22:37:57 2015 UTC,"I had the same experience while I was going up through the small sizes: they basically stretched up on their own, and there was no resistance until around 2g or so.

I'm 25 and I've had my ears pierced for about 20 years, so maybe that makes a difference."
Stretched,35vf04,PCnerd73,3,Thu May 14 12:11:56 2015 UTC,"It could, especially if you had a tendency to wear heavy jewelry before stretching. There was one redditor on here whose mother could fit a 6mm plug in her lobes since they'd stretched naturally over the years."

Stretched,35x0rg,MrBirdChest,2,Thu May 14 05:33:40 2015 UTC,"Based on advice I've seen here, I would downsize and start at least daily oil massages to break up the scar tissue. Since you've already had it for so long, it's hard to say if it will ever completely go away."
Stretched,35ueae,colty123,2,Wed May 13 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"A blowout is when the fistula ends up outside the hole in your lobe. Irritation and swelling don't always indicate a blowout. Taking your jewelry out was probably a good idea. Personally, I use vitamin e oil to massage my lobes and help with elasticity. I've never seen moisturizer recommended on this sub. Vitamin e, jojoba, or other oils like those can help get your ears in better shape. You never mentioned what size you're at, but downsizing and re stretching can thicken your lobes."
Stretched,35ueae,KREPharmD,1 point,Wed May 13 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the reply. I have jojoba oil that I usually used to lubricate my jewelry to put in, but never really massaged my lobes with it.

Stretched,35ueae,Divisadero,2,Wed May 13 20:06:48 2015 UTC,Are the tunnels high quality stainless steel? If both lobes are red maybe they're starting to react to it.
Stretched,35ueae,Divisadero,1 point,Wed May 13 18:31:48 2015 UTC,Yes they are stainless steel. I figured it could be a reaction but it seemed odd to me since this isn't the first time I've worn stainless steel for an extended period of time.
Stretched,35ueae,_Beelzebub,2,Thu May 14 02:11:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah but are they high quality steel? Like 316 lvm? From a known good quality brand like Anatometal or Industrial Strength? Some cheaper jewelry has polish to the finish that once worn for extended periods of time wears down from friction, exposure to body heat, etc and the nickel content can irritate the fistula or cause an allergy type reaction."
Stretched,35ueae,_Beelzebub,1 point,Thu May 14 02:58:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know for sure. I don't know where they were purchased because I got them as hand-me-downs, but this is very intriguing. I bet this is what I'm experiencing because I've never had my ears swell up like this, and after my left lobe did the other one did the day after."
Stretched,35ueae,_Beelzebub,1 point,Thu May 14 03:00:48 2015 UTC,Also what can I do to get my lobes in better shape? They've always been a bit red and thin.   Let your lobes go naked for a while and massage them daily with your jojoba oil. It will moisturize them and get rid of the redness and irritation. Daily massages will also get more blood flowing through your lobes which will promote healthy-fatty-cell-growth. Downsizing and re-stretching will fatten up your lobes since that process also increases blood flow. Good luck!

Other than that, look into double flare or dangles where you have no o-rings involved. If you have trouble with double flare jewelry, look for low flares to start with, try on a thicker/standard flare 2+ weeks after your stretch, or try Kao's silicone where you can scrunch them up before popping them in."

First, I would go back to your last size, massage your ears with jojoba oil, and wait for them to go back to normal before attempting to stretch again.  Next, I would stop using tapers.  They increase your risk for a blowout and are an unnecessary tool.  Natural stretching allows you to go straight into the next size.  There should be no resistance or pain when you stretch.  Natural stretching is just giving your ears the right amount of time between stretches so that the next pair will slip right in.   Lube your ears up good before stretching.  I recommend Jojoba oil, but a water based sex lube will work as well.  Jojoba oil is great for your ears and you can massage them with it to help them stretch easier next time around. Stretch after a hot shower, the heat makes you ears stretch easier.  Still use a lube. If you find yourself having trouble stretching up, look into taping.  You will need to change your tape every day for sanitation but it is definitely worth it.  Most of my stretches are natural, but for bigger jumps (2g-0g was a bitch) I use the taping meathod."

I would get rid of all the extra oils and use just jojoba, it is the closest to what your body naturally produces.  I would also use it for massaging, it's a great massage oil.  Don't be afraid to give your ears extra time if they need it, when you go from a 2 to a 0 that's going to be a huge jump in size and you'll likely need the extra time.  I use glass when I stretch, and when I go up by a big size I use the taping method.  I draw a line on the outside of the jewelry so that I can see where my starting point is for taping.  I get PTFE tape from Home Depot, it's about $3, the black one is better IMHO.  You wrap it around and smooth it out, making sure to keep track of your starting point.  The sharpie comes off of glass easily but if you don't want to draw on your jewelry, you can make an indent with your fingernail as you do each turn.  Start with 1-3 layers for your first stretch, don't do too much or it can make the tape slide off or just be too big of a stretch.  After you finish with the layers, use jojoba oil to lubricate them.  Let the oil soak in, wait about 30 seconds, and then add more until it's really slippery, it soaks up more than you'll think.  Replace the tape every day, at most skip one day here and there but that's not recommended.  The tape is porous and cannot be sterilized which is why it's so important to change it out regularly and to not stretch too big at once.  I am usually able to add 1-2 layers a week, sometimes quicker sometimes a little longer.  It all depends on how stretchy your ears are.  When you're just sitting around and don't need your hands, you can also massage/lightly tug on your ears without oil just to help them be ready to be stretched.  None of this should be painful or uncomfortable in any way.  If you need clarification or have any questions, feel free to let me know!"
Stretched,356s5b,Snyng,5,Thu May 7 16:04:31 2015 UTC,"Its way too soon to use organic and DF... Your stretch isn't even healed.  If your ears are bleeding, remove your jewelry and let it heal without anything. Then when its healed in about 3-6 months, you can restretch slowly."

As impatient as I am, I REALLY want healthy and aesthetically pleasing body mods.  I can't understand people letting their impatience get the best of them and just ruining their body like that.  I know people who stretch with and exclusively wear acrylic.

I've been stretching for almost four years now and I'm at 5/8"" with no problems :) just listen to your body and wear quality jewelry (King's Body Jewelry, Body Art Forms, and Gorilla Glass are good places to start, especially when you get to bigger sizes). shop in the clearance bins for cheap plugs until you get to 1/2"", then get a couple of really nice pairs :)"

All the other smaller sizes are just too small and the jewelry is too light to make a difference. That being said, tapers aren't necessarily the right way at the smaller sizes either (although they are very easy to use). As soon as you can, ditch the tapers and you should start taping up to the next sizes. Like I said, once you're at about a 2g is when I'd say the jewelry can be heavy enough to stretch your ears naturally.  Also, with everything you see here, take the advice with a grain of salt because no one knows your ears like you do."

Stretched,34voac,st0lenglances,3,Mon May 4 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"I think an okay age to start is when you can buy your own (good) jewelry to do so. Reason being, because a 13 year old probably isn't going to have the money, or know better, to buy good quality jewelry that isn't from Hot Topic or the like. A lot of younger kids tend to go behind their parents back and buy shit stuff at the mall that's cheap because that's all they can get access to and afford, and they'll buy it when they're out with their friends instead of their parents.   I know that there's a ton of adults that stretch their ears stupidly as well, but I do think that you gain a lot more common sense as you get older and are more likely to research things correctly and listen to it, instead of ""well my friend said...""   I don't necessarily think that you should be 18 to stretch your ears, but you should view stretching as a mod that may or may not be permanent, and I personally do not feel that most 13 year olds(or any young teenager etc) will have the sense to acknowledge that and/or care. They'll just do it anyway because they want to and kids are super stubborn to listen to correct advice. A lot want large stretched ears and as soon as possible and don't want to be patient.   So I guess if someone shows that they are mature enough and are willing to do it correctly with good quality jewelry, then that's fine. But that's usually not the case with young people, at least from my experience."
Stretched,34voac,artgeekwithglasses,3,Tue May 5 01:08:41 2015 UTC,"If I were a parent, I would allow my kids to start stretching at 14 years old, but only under my supervision until they are 16 years old. This would insure they won't rush it and destroy their ears."
Stretched,34voac,TheDumbCaddie,2,Tue May 5 03:18:00 2015 UTC,"I'm still a minor (17) and started stretching my ears at about 14 years old, maybe even 13, I'm not too sure. But I do remember researching how to stretch properly only after I tore my ear stretching from I think it was 4g to 6g.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that the problem isn't the minors not stretching right on purpose, but not even knowing that they're doing it wrong. I think that once it becomes a lot more accepted in ""professional"" settings, the amount of kids stretching wrong will diminish because there will hopefully be more advice out there that can be found without specifically looking for it."

My ears are fine now and I'm at 3/4"" and happy. I am also only 17.  The horror story I have comes from a friend of mine who despite my best advice, stretched really badly. When I met him, he was at 1/2"" and he planned on going to about an inch. I thought that was fine, his lobes were thin and he was wearing acrylic but then he told me about his stretching journey. He pierced his own ear with a safety pin and stretched it to 2g THAT NIGHT (I can't even imagine the pain). He then stretched to 14mm with a steel tunnel I bought him (bad quality steel that I wouldn't use on myself but it's gotta be better than acrylic). He did the same to 16mm about 2 months later (he just forgot, he wasn't waiting for his body to be ready or anything). Then, about a week later, he rocked into college wearing a 20mm steel plug that he dead stretched from 16mm with. His ear was (unsurprisingly) catbutted, thin, blown out, bleeding and scabby. I'm not joking about the bleeding too, the teachers were telling him all day that his ear was bleeding. He was at 20mm for about a week before his tunnel got punched out in a fight. He is now going naked until his ear ""doesn't hurt to touch"" (it's been about 4 months) and I reckon the hole is about 6mm wide. He is a dick. DON'T DO THAT.   I do have another friend who stretched responsibly up to about 42mm and then had to take them out for school (he was 15). His ears look a lot bigger but are actually a little smaller than mine at the minute but he plans to stretch back up when he is out of school. A lot of people were against this friend stretching that big but he did it responsibly and did most things right."

I was uneducated when I started stretching and had my ears pierced with bad jewelry, so my lobes have thin spots on the bottoms in certain places. And my ears unfortunately blew out at 22mm. I also have stretched my septum to 1g with a goal size of 00g, over the summer Im probably gonna have my lip scalpelled to 10mm with a goal size of 12mm. I stretched safely but was not educated on proper jewelry and stretched with silicone from 0g to 7/8ths, which was fucking stupid but I didn't know, and honestly, the best way to learn how to stretch is to make your mistakes and learn from them."

I knew it was wrong, and luckily I never had any real problems, but I did it anyway (mostly because I was 13 and not mature enough to understand life long consequences). I don't regret stretching my ears, but I regret doing it how I did, but being so young (and very stupid), I didn't have access to anything better.

I have no desire to go up in size anymore.  You look at your old small ears and say ""lol I was so silly, I thought those were big and cool"" I look at my old ears and say ""lol I was so silly, I thought those looked nice on me.""

Stretched,34ggsd,Aimes25,3,Sat May 2 03:10:13 2015 UTC,"How long have you had your ears pierced? I've had mine pierced about 20 years (I was fairly young and had them pierced with a gun) and had no problem going straight to a 14g. I think it mostly had to do with the fact that I have had mine pierced for a very long time. You could always start with a 16g like suggested. Also stretching should never hurt. When I stretched to a 14g all I felt was a slight pinch and that was it. As for being nauseous,  it's just your nerves. When I first started I was super nervous I would mess up and felt the same way. Good luck on your stretching journey!"

Stretched,34e1dk,SJLopos,9,Thu Apr 30 11:45:04 2015 UTC,"If you're stretching your ears you have to go in with the understanding that you're making permanent alterations to your body.  Skin is extremely elastic but it does wholly vary from person to person.  I had a friend who never get past a 2g and you can still see light through his lobes after years without wearing jewelry; my ears were at 3/4"" in October but I haven't worn anything since and you can hardly tell I had them stretched unless you look close.  There's no universal point of no return, just individual bodies that will heal in their own ways."

Stretched,34e1dk,CrunchyPancakes,3,Thu Apr 30 14:05:33 2015 UTC,"1/2"" here. My jewelry will be tough to put back in if I leave them out for a few days. I've even had plugs fall out while I was asleep and had to use oil to get them back in the next day. I haven't left jewelry out for months at a time but I'm pretty sure my ears would look like a normal piercings if I did. As top commenter said, everyone varies. My ears are like rubber bands as far as elasticity goes :)"
Stretched,34e1dk,jbrown5217,6,Thu Apr 30 20:00:08 2015 UTC,"You are going to get different answers depending who you talk to because your friends are right, it can depend on the person.  The general idea is that somewhrre between a 4g and 00g is likely a persons no return though.  My ears like to shrink a lot and I think my no return is probably something more like 7/16"" or 1/2"" though.  I am well past those points though."
Stretched,34e1dk,st0lenglances,4,Thu Apr 30 12:45:30 2015 UTC,"When I stretched my ears the first time to 00g, I got impatient and tore my ear so I decided to downsize completely and start over later. I had been stretching my ears from 18g to 00g for about a year and a half at that point. My ears shrunk to about a 10g/8g but they looked like a 16g/14g piercing, so I feel like I got a little lucky. My ears are not very stretchy or elastic so I was a bit scared that they wouldn't shrink that much.  As already mentioned, it's entirely based on how your how body heals that will determine how much or if they shrink. I agree completely with the idea that stretching your ears, even to a small size, should be treated as a permanent mod since you have no way of knowing if they will shrink or not without actually doing it.  With that being said though, I feel that if you take really good care of your ears they will have a higher chance of shrinking back (not absolutely proven like I said, just my opinion).   Try to keep them moisturized, especially in winter if you have one where you live, and try to regularly do oil massages. Stretch slowly and do not force anything. If it's painful in any way, stop, because you're trying to stretch too fast. When you force your ears to stretch, they will create scar tissue to heal themselves and scar tissue will reduce your chances of them shrinking(and being stretched further to an extent). If you have any scars on your body, I'm sure that you've noticed the difference in texture compared to regular skin, and the same thing applies to your ears if you create any trauma to them.  So go slow and take care of your lobes because they are the only ones that you have!"
Stretched,34e1dk,champaignthrowaway,3,Thu Apr 30 16:22:45 2015 UTC,"It really does vary per person, but generally around 0g or so.  I took mine out at 00g and they were back down to a 6g within a week.  Back at a 2g now and will probably stay there for a while.  A healed ear piercing will likely never close up completely once it's been there for a year or two but they will shrink up given enough time without jewelry.  A tattoo artist I know took his out a year or two ago at 7/8"" and they are significantly smaller now.  He could probably get a 0g double flare in there but that's about it.  They don't look weird or dangle at all, just small holes.  My brother on the other hand was at an inch and ended up getting his surgically closed.  You can't even tell his ears were ever pierced anymore, much less stretched out to a full inch.  If you rush the stretching process you are much less likely to end up with ears elastic enough to close back up significantly."
Stretched,34e1dk,bigjimnm,3,Thu Apr 30 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"It really does depend on the person, and also the length of time it has been stretched.  My ears are currently 2 5/8 inches, and I've been over 2 inches now for close to 10 years, and my lobes don't shrink much at all. After a few days with nothing in them, I could get away with wearing light 2 inch tunnels and not have them fall out, but they won't go any smaller than that."
Stretched,34e1dk,perkachurr,3,Thu Apr 30 20:38:11 2015 UTC,Its definitely different for everyone. I had my ears at 0g at one point and had to take them out for a few months because of issues. I only ended up closing to an 10g.
Stretched,34e1dk,johannamaeja,2,Fri May 1 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"I always heard that 0g was the point of no return too, but everyone is different. I was up to just barely 2g at the end of 2012 and I had to shrink them. They only got down to 10g, so if I go up a couple sizes now (i just started stretching again this March), and need to shrink them again I'm fine with only being at an 8 or so."
Stretched,34d792,EatenByAstronauts,8,Thu Apr 30 05:07:49 2015 UTC,"Have you ever considered glass color front plugs? Both Gorilla Glass and Glasswear Studios make them. They come in a ton of colors and are pretty cheap in terms of how nice of a quality they have.  These are Glasswear Studios' version and I believe that they have flatter fronts compared to Gorilla Glass, which have more domed fronts. Here's a link to their version.  I just linked both in black since it's a pretty basic color, but like I said both companies make them in a rainbow of colors to choose from so you definitely have some options! I think that you can get them in both single flared and double flared for both companies as well.  Another option would be maybe some wood plugs in a simple design too. Wood is usually pretty conservative looking in my opinion and doesn't have an ""in your face"" look so that could be worth looking into. Along the same route I would look at some stone plugs maybe. Something like this is pretty, while having a slightly muted color to it so it's not obnoxious."

I prefer double flared because the wearable isn't obnoxiously long like on single flared glass. If you've been at that size for a while it shouldn't be an issue getting them in, just insert them like you would a button.

I've also heard large gauge piercings are often pierced at say 8g then stretched to 6g at the moment by the piercer (sounds like what OP has been offered - I hope). I know nothing about that part though"
Stretched,347pau,khitsule,2,Wed Apr 29 02:20:36 2015 UTC,the largest I've heard of (I stress that this is just what I've heard of) is piercing at a 6g and stretching to a 4g

Stretched,345mu7,johannamaeja,4,Tue Apr 28 14:22:30 2015 UTC,"A week is a very, very short amount of time to wait between stretches. Stretching that fast is begging for a blowout to happen. Never force your ears to stretch. You said that you have rounded glass plugs. If they're single-flare, I would wait three more weeks and see if your ears are ready to stretch then, and use the rounded glass plug. I always dead stretched with rounded glass plugs. It took longer than taper stretching but my ears are very healthy. A week is a very short time to have between stretches."
Stretched,345mu7,loveswell,3,Tue Apr 28 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"6g to 4g should take 2-3 month, 1-2 months of your ears are elastic. I week is not even close to enough time. It shouldn't hurt at all to stretch and you should feel much resistance. If you do, you need more time. If by 3 months you can't dead stretch, try a taper. If a taper still won't work, try the taping method.  Edit: meant to address to OP, but this will do."

OP can certainly find nice wood plugs for cheaper than $75, but I really doubt he would find anything of quality for less than $30 +/- 3$ or $4 bucks.

If your lobes are ever irritated or tender, wear something else until they're better. I was kind of mad when I realized mine were dyed and was a bit scared but as long as I'm careful, I haven't had any issues. Over time and with enough wear, the color will fade.

Stretched,33u48x,whosdoug,5,Sat Apr 25 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"Stretch it. It's really not a bad process to stretch up, and if you decide you don't like it (some people have issues with their gums/teeth), you can always take it out before it gets too big.  Scalpelling means that the hole will always be there, and would require surgery to close.  I stretched mine up from a 12g initial piercing all the way up to 17mm (over 5/8 inch). I originally planned to go to 00g or 1/2 inch as well, but it did get loose and I love it (and the beautiful stone plugs), so I went up. I really don't think I'll go bigger. It's at a size where it does stand out, but doesn't overpower my face.  Best of luck!"
Stretched,33u48x,bigjimnm,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"The problem with stretching it is the cost. Labrets are sorta expensive compared to eyelets. Where a pair of steel eyelets cost from 10-30 dollars, a single 6g+ labret ranges from 30-60 and even more. I'd personally go the route of scalpelling. The only downside is that it would have to be stitched if you decide to remove it, and for some, that can be as early as a month if it causes gum recession and erosion."

Stretched,33rekd,st0lenglances,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:19:14 2015 UTC,"It's awesome that you've decided to use that method for stretching!   Single flared glass is great for this and is pretty inexpensive. Glasswear Studios and Gorilla Glass are both great companies that I would look into. Bodyartforms.com has a big selection of each, and both companies also make in between sizes like 7g, 5g, etc. Those would be great if you ever find that a stretch just isn't working out and you need a little help.  Another option is wearing stone jewelry, but make sure that your ears are healed from their last stretch first. By stretching with this method you shouldn't have any problems with tearing and such, but I would still stay on the safe side personally. Stone is porous and while it should have a smooth wearable area, it can sometimes have imperfections being that it's an organic material. I want to say that certain stone might be a little heavier, at least hematite is, but I've never worn it myself.  I would also get some type of oil for daily massages, and I'm a big fan of holey butter too. Jojoba oil, vitamin e oil, and emu oil are all suggested regularly and it just depends what on what you prefer to use. Jojoba oil is a lot like the sebum that your skin already produces and vitamin e oil is said to help with reducing scar tissue a little bit. Jojoba oil is pretty runny and it's easy to pour out a lot more than you need if you're not careful, where vitamin e oil is pretty thick (those are the only two that I've used to give advice on). Holey butter is a blend of different oils and natural butters that really helps with moisturizing and I feel that it keeps your lobes moisturized longer than oil alone. I really like using it in winter for this reason. You can't quite massage with it as well but I find that I reach for mine a lot more often than oil after a shower or when I wake up and didn't wear jewelry to bed."

I have majorly downsized and re-stretched multiple times since, but my ears simply refuse to go back up to 1"" so I don't really expect to size up (I do, however, pamper the fuck out of my lobes in the hopes that they will want to someday..).

Stretched,33lq7c,cuntcakez,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:24:41 2015 UTC,"I'm at 9/16 after about 3 years.  I started when I was in high school and basically used super shitty acrylic tapers and plugs until I got to 0g (in my defense, I was really good about waiting in between stretches and not skipping sizes).  I sat at 0g until I got to college at the beginning of this year, smartened up about stretching, and have since stretched up from 8mm to 14mm since September.  My ears have self stretched really easily since then and it usually only takes a month for my plugs to start getting really loose and falling out.  My goal size is 1 inch eventually but while in college I'm just aiming for 3/4, and then when I can find some solid employment I'll stretch bigger.  My go-to jewelry is usually just stainless steel/titanium tunnels.  I could never wear them in high school because my parents would be able to tell I had stretched ears, so I love wearing them now.  I can't afford anything too nice as a broke college student but I love Kaos earskins, steel tunnels and my hematite plugs."

I got my left ear pierced at Peircing Pagoda, shutter, when I was 13 and my right a year later. I first started stretching when I was 19 and went from an 18 gauge to 7/16"" over about 2-2.5 years. I decided to take them out and let my ears close up. I wore nothing for about a year and both ears got to the point where they looked like regular piercings again and I would occasionally, maybe 3 or 4 times a year, wear something in them. I started guaging my cartilage from a 14 gauge, done professionally with a needle when I was 18, about a year or so ago and I just stretched to a 6 in that. I decided about 2 months ago to see what gauge I could fit in my lobes and I was able to start back off at a 4. I've found re-stretching to be so much easier. I've waited until my eyelets start getting really loose and falling out, which has seemed to be about ever 2 weeks or so, and I've very gently seen if they will take the next size up. I know I've gone pretty damn quick this time from 4ga-0ga but I've been listening to my body and dead stretching when it's ready for it. The 0 to 00 jump seems to be my most difficult so far, but I believe that's because my 00s are 10mm so I'm in the market for some 9mm plugs now. My current goal size is 1/2"" and I plan to take the rest of my stretching journey very slowly and tape between sizes.  My favorites for everyday wear are simple stainless steel single flare eyelets, but my favorite plugs for my current size are my Diablo Orgnaics Mexican Amber plugs. I'm going to be semi-disappointed when I get to 00 that they'll no longer fit. Once I hit my goal of 1/2"" I plan to get a new pair. I've been lucky so far and I haven't had to buy a single piece of jewelry so far. I saved all of my old jewelry which has made it very easy and cheap to stretch again.  i also have a 6ga Helix in my left ear, and an 8ga septum with more large gauge piercing planned for the near future."

I've used steel tunnels for each stretch, and will continue to do so until I get to 2g. I'd like to stay there for a while before moving up so I'll buy a couple of stone or glass plugs when I get there.   If it seems I've gone fast, well, maybe I have. But I use jojoba oil every day, have never forced anything, they all slipped in with minimum discomfort, except for a slight tingle and a little warmth that didn't last more that a couple of hours.

Second image is 6g, where I got my first earskins. I started stretching nearly 2 years ago immediately after my girlfriend and I broke up. She didn't like stretched ears and I did, so I immediately started that journey. from 14g, it took me 3 months and I stopped at this size for a few months during an internship.  Third image is the same earskins, but at 0g. Took another 3 months to get here. If I didn't take that break beforehand, I'd be screwed, because I really shouldn't have stretched that much in this time frame but got lucky. I stayed at this size for 6 months or so, thinking it was my goal size. When I realized 00g plugs fit in just fine, I kept going up...  Fourth image is where I'm at right now, 9/16"" or 14mm with those same clear earskins. I started dead stretching in this time period instead of tapers, and I believe it took me about 6-7 months, maybe longer. I think this is the best balance between a ""large"" hole and the shape of my ears, as well as shrinkability, corporate acceptance, etc. and have been here for 2 or 3 months now. I have no plans to go any larger, but time will tell.  I've been stretching my septum up from 12g as well, currently at 8g, but those progress pics are much less interesting because I wear retainers and I'm definitely not at my goal size of at least 4g. Just depends how far I can go before I start denting cartilage, or if I find the denting process doable, as far as it'll go before its noticeable or strange looking."

But I honestly doubt you would have any trouble just stretching from where you are depending on how large you're wanting to go. (Keep in mind I'm speaking without seeing your ears)   if nothing else I'd try to stretch the old fashion way, see how your ears do and go from there before going through the long healing process of a scalpelling."

My ears were fine during the stretch, but I obviously pushed them too far or they weren't happy about something, because they would bleed the next day or even two days later. I always figured it was micro-tearing that didn't feel painful but was enough to build up some blood over the next 24-48 hours (I have very sensitive ears that like to be big jerks, no matter how gentle I am to them). You can always just pop your 8gs back in and do some salt soaks over the next few days, and try again in a week or two.   8g to 6g is the first ""hard"" stretch for most people. 2 months might not be enough for you. I am actually in the middle of mine; took me 4 months + taping to get from 8g to 7g. Shit is ridiculous, but slower to start is better than having to move backwards and try again multiple times."

Stretched,33b1wh,jadefirefly,3,Tue Apr 21 04:17:10 2015 UTC,"Wait. If the lobes aren't ready then they aren't ready. On another note,  how is she stretching? Tapers? Us she using lube? If there's absolutely no give then wait a few weeks and try again,  and if that doesn't work,  start trying the taping method."
Stretched,33b1wh,Superbowl269,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:03:47 2015 UTC,Using tapers for the smaller sizes. And oil. I'm having her massage her lobes with oil daily. Maybe we'll start taping...

Stretched,337ep7,Eris_Grun,6,Mon Apr 20 05:48:15 2015 UTC,"It's not that they are shrinking up that quickly it is that when you tried to put the pair of double flares in you pushed your ears too hard and you ended up irritating them and possibly tearing them which in turn caused your ears to swell up significantly. This is going to make putting in even single flared plugs a little difficult. I would go naked for a little bit until your ears calm down and return to normal. As for wearing double flares they can be very tricky. First start by taking a very warm shower and lubing your ears very well then put the plug in like a button. If the plug doesn't just pop in then stop because your ears aren't ready. If this is the case then just wait and be patient, you could even try wearing single flared stone plugs which will stretch your ears naturally over time and help with double flares."
Stretched,337ep7,Araxias,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:27:38 2015 UTC,"all of this.  All I really have to add is to use jojoba oil instead of coconut.  It is closer to the natural oils your body creates.  Also, massaging them daily with the oil helps keep them happy and stretchy."

Stretched,337ep7,Darkreidos,2,Mon Apr 27 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"I can't really answer your question but tapers are great tools for getting jewelry into your ears with the least amount of strain possible, just put the taper in and push it through with the plug."

Stretched,334hs4,sad_balloon,1 point,Sun Apr 19 21:19:22 2015 UTC,Stone and glass get pretty slippery from your skin's oil. If you dont want to take them out try wearing wood or silicone for a bit more friction. Wood is my favorite everyday material anyway.

I would still give them a week to heal up. A paper cut heals in a few days so I don't see why some microscopic tear wouldn't be healed in a week. The bigger you go the bigger the tears will be so you will have to wait longer in the future.   People get a little uppity about waiting times when no one would give a paper cut a month to heal. At the very small sizes you're at if it goes in fine with 0 discomfort just listen to your body. Giving the mico tears you can't even feel a week to heal up should be fine."

Stretched,32plan,LeannaBard,2,Tue Apr 21 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really think 4 weeks is necessary at 14g. Definitely don't get the idea that you should stretch again right away until your ear starts tearing. You want it to slide in with no problem. But since you only go up by fractions of millimeters at those little sizes, two or three weeks will probably be okay. The main thing to remember is to stop if you feel resistance and just wait q while longer. Especially at these small sizes when you are still learning. How you take care of your ears now can and will affect how they turn out in the end."
Stretched,32plan,Darkreidos,2,Wed Apr 15 23:52:36 2015 UTC,"Some people here go crazy over waiting times, the important thing is that you don't force anything in (no force at all, really), and there should never be pain. If it slides in as easy as the 14, go ahead and put it in."
Stretched,32plan,BakerELMT,0,Thu Apr 16 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"If you want to go as safe as possible, step 1 is throwing out that stretching kit.  Buy 1 set of jewelry at a time if cost is an issue, until you get to a 2-0 you should be able to find glass plugs for ~$10/pair.  Use jojoba oil or a water based sex lube with as few ingredients as possible. Massage daily, and do your stretching after a hot shower.  DO NOT stretch too quickly.  I recommend seeing a piercer for your first few stretches until you get to know your ears and when they're ready for a new size.  I've had my ears take anywhere from 3 weeks to nearly 2 months to go up a size, but I never stretched before they were ready.  Do sea salt soaks (4tsp non iodized sea salt to 1 gallon of distilled water.  Shake well before use, pour some Juno a mug or bowl and microwave until it's slightly warmer than room temperature but NOT hot) if you see any redness or irritation, and at least once a week during stretching even if all looks well.  Go slow, be patient.  If you're not sure if your ears are ready, wait.  Tape or do natural stretching but do not use tapers."

Stretched,32plan,f0xish,4,Mon Apr 20 18:17:42 2015 UTC,I'm sorry people are down voting you instead of giving advice. it's never safe to skip sizes and even if you think your ears are ready it's never okay to do more than one stretch in a day. wait a couple weeks before stretching again or you'll get used to doing it quickly and fuck up your ears.

Stretched,32nttm,CocoaBagelPuffs,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:47:27 2015 UTC,"I also have no inherent aversion to acrylic (barring like you said, fresh stretches etc), but I have heard of people suddenly developing  reactions to materials, particularly acrylic.

I ended up taking my jewelry out completely after about a year and a half, then fast forward to maybe another year or two, I decided to stretch again and I couldn't wear the acrylic for more than a few hours without redness, swelling, itching, etc, none of which happened the first time around.

Stretched,32m0l9,st0lenglances,2,Wed Apr 15 00:44:39 2015 UTC,Hematite is a pretty heavy material that might be worth looking into if you're interested in the natural stretching route. Glass is a good option too and is the most recommended material to use for stretching as well.
Stretched,32m0l9,OneEyedOneHorned,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:35:50 2015 UTC,"You could try wearing heavier materials but be careful as instead of stretching, gravity can easily thin your lobes rather than expand the holes. It is possible, yes, but it's unpredictable, and thin lobes could be a pain later on if you're looking to keep stretching larger. Also be aware that many of the heavier materials are more porous and not good for fresh stretches. While you can use them to stretch, their makeup is more suitable for once you get to your goal."

If you'd be willing to go to a physical store I know that Hot Topic sells Kaos earskins and their jewelry (at least at every location I've been to) is always buy one get one half off so you can get two pairs for around $30 and they will often have clearance pairs too that are buy one get one for a $1.

Plumbers tape for everything (PTFE) is mainly used on threaded pipe and connectors to prevent leaking.  So its safe to assume that it is good at absorbing moisture which will dry out your ears.

Stretched,329m15,1summitash,8,Sat Apr 11 22:31:14 2015 UTC,I've only used PTFE and never had a bad experience. The trick is to use a lot of oil when wrapping up the plugs. The tape will turn translucent when it's saturated.

They were more ""grabby"" for the tape and shaped differently in the back in a way that made it easier to insert with the tape on."
Stretched,3258xw,therest,2,Sat Apr 11 03:13:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I use glass single flares, so maybe I'll try using tunnels. Thanks for the suggestion! The struggle is real:("
Stretched,3258xw,KillerSeagull,2,Sat Apr 11 06:36:32 2015 UTC,"The struggle is real. I don't have stretchy lobes either. I had to start taping at the jump from 8g to 6g, because after 6 months of waiting it just wasn't going to happen. It took me a similar amount of time between 10g and 8g. I've finally hit my goal size, but it took me a good three years to get here :T The upside (possibly downside? should I ever want to go back to normal piercing size) is that I can already go naked for the night if I want, because they're not shrinking either. Ah well, I fucking love my ears, for once in my life I'm not allergic to standard jewelery (nickel allergy!). Stone and steel and glass are way better :)"

Stretched,324bay,Hoocha_Puukwa,-4,Fri Apr 10 18:10:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend it for other people with sensitive lobes, but personally, I have used electrical tape in the past. I've seen that bondage tape or PTFE tape. Wrap enough around the tunnel so that the tunnel goes in fairly easily with some lube. You don't want to force anything in and risk a chance of a blowout or tearing anything. I usually do 1 or 2 wraps depending on how tight the jewellery is."
Stretched,324bay,CrunchyPancakes,2,Fri Apr 10 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"Eh, everything except electrical tape. I'd stick with bondage tape or PTFE (although I've recently found out that PTFE dried my ears out like crazy) Don't want any adhesive remaining on your jewelry."

How they look is a matter of opinion, but the back side of lobe would easily thin out while the front is still thick, and no one wants thin, uneven lobes, its just begging for problems. Plus, at a certain larger size they'd start to appear odd and obvious that its not right. Fortunately you can get pierced as large as 8g (maybe larger?) if you wanna stretch, so I'd recommend getting repeirced at that size."

You'll need to take the current one out and let it heal for at least 6-8 weeks before getting it repierced, though. The sooner you take it out, the better, as it may not fully close since it's mostly healed already. It'll hurt more the second time since you'll have scar tissue, but you can massage the scar tissue as it heals to try and break it down faster. Definitely call the piercer you plan to have do the repiercing to see if they recommend anything else, too."

Stretched,31zsjx,Bassookajoe,3,Thu Apr 9 13:09:19 2015 UTC,"At smaller sizes it can be as scary as it looks. Sometimes the flare is very close to the next size up, so be really sure your ears can handle getting that in. Also, put them in at an angle. Start with a little corner on the bottom and kinda roll it through, if that makes sense. Do the same thing to get them out, just backward."
Stretched,31zsjx,TheDumbCaddie,2,Thu Apr 9 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"Well I recently bought some (cheap & shitty) wood plugs of 5mm because I needed them quickly for a weekend. It turns out the flares were about 6mm, but I was already able to put in my 6mm tapers without pain so I figured it wasn't a problem. They went in really easy, but then my lobes shrunk back to 5mm while I was wearing them, so taking them out was a little painful despite massive amounts of lube, but I hope I didn't tear anything.   So if you do decide to get some, make sure not to buy crappy ones that have massive flares, and make sure the flares are not pointy or sharp.  I hope somebody with more experience can tell you more than me.  Also, for putting them in, don't put them in straight - start by pushing the flare through sideways."
Stretched,31zsjx,Darkreidos,2,Thu Apr 9 13:50:36 2015 UTC,"At smaller sizes (for me anything below 0g) they were basically impossible to get in or got stuck.

The hole wasn't obvious, but some leakage still occurred.  I've since re-stretched it up to 17mm (over 5/8 inch) now, and it won't go smaller than 13mm (1/2 inch) no matter what. I do need to always wear jewelry in it to avoid leakage. I often go with nothing at night to keep it tight to eliminate leakage as well.  Stretched labrets are a serious modification, and if you're thinking that you might want to close it in the future, I would not recommend it. That's why it's such an uncommon mod.

When my ears were still that small a gauge (until about an eight, probably), I would just take them out while I rode. After they healed, of course. The backside of my studs and tunnels was always pushed against my neck and just super uncomfortable. But when I got to a larger gauge, I started wearing silicone plugs. They're roughly a billion times more comfortable and hella flexible in my opinion. Then getting my helmet on and off was just like before I was pierced.   B) I did have some bleeding issues the two times I rode with steel in. I never had jewelry with a ball to hold it in place though, so that might help,but I wouldn't know.   C) You hella might have. It all really depends on how easily you scar and the amount of trauma on the inside of your lobes.   D) Pretty much answered in A. Silicone tunnels and just how I do normally.

Stretched,31twoy,KREPharmD,2,Wed Apr 8 03:02:50 2015 UTC,"This is a copy and paste from a thread I left a comment on about a month ago with a few added bits:  The only tape that I have used is PTFE/plumber's tape. I personally never had a problem with it becoming too dry and a big reason I like it is because the width of the tape is already the perfect size and you only need to cut it lengthwise. With bondage tape you typically need to cut it length and width. I believe that PTFE tape is thinner than bondage also. You can get a roll of PTFE at almost any store that has a hardware section for about $2, where bondage would need to be purchased at a more specialty type store or online. Bondage is more expensive, but you would get a huge roll of it compared to the PTFE. It's all just a matter of personal preference though, people swear by either one or the other usually.  I would wrap 1 or 2 layers around my single flared jewelry every maybe 2 or 3 days. Every time you add another wrap, you'll want to replace all of the tape too. If you don't, you'll be trapping all of the bacteria and gunk in between every new layer and that can really cause some problems with possible infection, not mention that it would just be gross in general. You could replace all of the tape everyday if you wanted to as well. And just because you need or want to replace the tape doesn't necessarily mean you need to add another layer if you don't feel like it. I would recommend taking them out when you shower too, so that they don't get all wet and absorb all that moisture. You'll want to oil the taped jewelry at least once a day, or more if necessary. Like I said, I have never had a problem with the tape becoming too dry, but it's a common problem other people face when using PTFE tape so make sure you keep your lobes well moisturized.   For a few tips, I would always forget how many layers I would be at after taping for a week or two, so I made a note in my phone with little tally marks to keep track of how many I was at, haha. And then to keep track of where every layer was on the jewelry, I would use my fingernail and make an indent mark on the back (like where you'd have the o-ring) every time the tape would overlap so I could make sure all of the layers were even if that makes sense. An edit of this part: me and the OP of that thread talked a bit and they told me that instead of making a mark on the actual tape, they took a sharpie and made a tiny dot on the jewelry itself (not on the wearable portion) to keep track of where the tape started to overlap, so that is definitely an idea to keep in mind as well!  Another thing that I liked to do was use two pairs of jewelry instead of taping just one pair if possible. As I was wearing my current taped jewelry, I would pre-wrap the other pair so it was ready when I needed it. I would usually pre-tape it before I got in the shower so I didn't need to put my old dirty pair back in after I just cleaned my lobes and had to fiddle around with taping the other pair. I had a few pairs of each size so I was able to do this, but it's completely understandable if you don't have extras and don't want to buy more jewelry for a size that you won't be at for very long.  Also, just remember that practice makes perfect! I had such a hard time when I first started using tape and I gave up on it for a while. But the more that you do it, the easier it will get. It used to take me a few minutes to tape just one plug, and after taping on and off for a few years I was able to do it in about 30 seconds to a minute!"

I have Meijer by my house, and I got my jojoba oil there and it's the brand Desert Essence. It's a 4oz bottle for about $8 or $9, compared to the $13 4oz bottle on BAF and the $10 2oz bottle on plug your holes.

Even if your ears are ready, just try to stretch as slowly as possible. A size every few months. Don't be forceful because that's how blowouts happen. Use jojoba oil. The usual. Happy stretching!"
Stretched,31ho99,tigrxlily,3,Sun Apr 5 04:52:12 2015 UTC,"taking your plugs out at night is valuable no matter what you wear because it allows more blood to flow into your lobe and help soften that tissue for easier stretching in general. while actively stretching (or after a stretch, for about a week) keep your plugs in to prevent them from shrinking, but taking them out at night once they're stable at any given size is good for their health :)"

I went naked and did sea salt soaks and massaged my ear with vitamin e oil. After a couple days I put in a 10g plug (as the pain was gone by then and I was a bit worried about the hole closing entirely). My ear was tender, but getting better. After that I slowly worked my way back up to 2g (without skipping any sizes, of course), and then when it was properly ready, 0g.   We all make mistakes, and I don't think this is anything your lobes won't come back from. Just learn from it and practice better patience in the future :) The wait to get to 00g was made a bit easier, as all I had to tell myself was that impatience would just set me back even longer."

I'm concerned because the backs of both lobes have darkness around the holes. It could be bruising. I can't really see well enough back there to tell what's going on. But the swelling has gone down almost completely since doing a sea salt soak so I will continue with those and hope for the best!"
Stretched,31ft7b,raddaya,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:09:36 2015 UTC,"It was just the one lobe, luckily. That said, it was initially SO swollen it was impossible to tell what the back looked like. Afterwards it did look fairly normal. To be fair I do not bruise easily, so it very well might be the case for you. Make sure to do plenty of massages and pay attention to your lobes, how they feel/look/etc. But I really do think it will be fine.  I had the bizarre effect of my lobe being significantly stretchier after it got cut. It had been my bitch ear prior to that, and now its perfectly healed, soft and stretchy. So maybe this will end up working out for you?"

Stretched,31dlnz,artgeekwithglasses,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:43:00 2015 UTC,"I believe you can stretch just about anything that you want to. Obviously you can stretch just skin like your lobes, but you can also stretch cartilage a fair amount. And also some piercings would of course be a lot easier to stretch than others.  Aside from stretching lobes, I think stretching cartilage and septums seem to be the most common among this sub. Both of these take a lot more patience to do and pain from stretching is a lot more common and unavoidable for some people, where stretching your lobes should not be painful.   While skin is far more elastic than cartilage, there still is somewhat of a limit for some people. Someone people with very thin, small earlobes would have a harder time getting to larger sizes like 2 inches than someone with large, thick lobes. It can still be done, but you would need to go about it carefully and slowly and make sure that you don't have thin spots and such which could ultimately tear your lobe in half in the worst case scenario. This would take a lot of carelessness to not notice or care before it got to that point though.   J.C. Potts suggests that if you plan to stretch your cartilage, it's best to just get your piercing done by a biopsy punch rather than a standard needle and then stretch. Of course, not everyone will plan to stretch their cartilage and might change their mind later on. In this case, it can definitely be done but should be done carefully. J.C. also suggests that if you stretch, you shouldn't stretch past about 2mm I believe to reduce the risks of complications, but others say otherwise. The problem with cartilage is that you can potentially shatter it underneath your skin, which can form ""cauliflower ear, "" again, this being worst case scenario. But even if you have your cartilage pierced at a small gauge then decide you want it to be maybe say a 4g or something instead, you can definitely still get it punched even though you have it pierced already.   Going along with small earlobes vs large ones, anatomy will play a big part in how much you can stretch a certain piercing. A 0g conch or septum will just not work for some people and it's better to be safe than sorry and try to attempt to push your body's limits sometimes.  If your body cannot accommodate a certain gauge you might want, it's usually best to just let it go and learn to accept what your body can handle safely."

Stretched,31eatf,kawaiitako,8,Sat Apr 4 06:36:18 2015 UTC,"Please don't use electrical tape!!! The adhesive on the tape breaks down at body temperature and has nasty chemicals that are NOT good for your ears whatsoever. If you're going to slowly tape up to the next size (which I highly recommend over tapers), use either bondage tape or PTFE - these are self-adhesive and have no nasty stickiness to them. When you're taping, be patient and add tape when you think your ears are ready for another layer, and make sure to change the tape on them regularly!!  As said in Pauly Unstoppable's Guide to Stretching: ""NEVER EVER use electrical tape, medical tape, duct tape, or any other tape that is rough or has an adhesive, the adhesive can run and irritate your ear, and some are sharp and can cut your ear, I don’t care if your friend or you have done it before and it worked fine, you are playing the odds when you do it, and the odds are only in your favor for so long, don’t come crying to me when you fuck your ears when it does run out."""

I feel dead stretching only really works on bigger sizes though,  so I don't think if be comfortable stretching 0 to 00 but maybe 00 to 1/2. I have contemplated doing it like that as well, but the way my ears gave me trouble yesterday putting in these new plugs (the back is externally threaded.... idk what idiot designed these but ugh) and having to basically force it through the back, I don't know if my ears will be ready to dead stretch anytime soon haha.

My right ear was super easy but my left ear has always been the harder one. I started to see my ears self stretching incredibly quickly to the point that my jewelery was falling out every two weeks.   The easiest way I have found to deal with this is taping.   I know there isn't much information about the usage of this product in relation to ear stretching, but I've been using palmers cocoa butter oil with vitamin e and collagen and elastin and if I had any scar tissue from former blow outs, it's completely gone.

Safe materials are glass or stone single flared plugs. You can find sizes by going to a reputable piercer.

If it's been a while and they're completely healed, then I don't see why you can't go to 14g since you're at 16g now.    I like emu oil, but jojoba oil is also very popular (and cheaper)."
Stretched,30w0ck,therest,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:35:39 2015 UTC,"My ears were pierced a little low, and trust me, yours are more than fine. I just recently hit my own goal size of 00g, and they're fine. That said I probably couldn't go any larger if I wanted haha, but your ears might be different!  I've always used vitamin e oil, to lube up and massage my ears daily and to lube up when stretching. Jojoba oil and holey butt'r are other good options!"
Stretched,30vv7c,CoknZambies,9,Tue Mar 31 03:03:05 2015 UTC,"Two months isn't adequate healing time for a tear, especially if you only downsized and didn't go completely jewelry-less. Go naked for at least six months then size up appropriately from there.   Also tapers aren't meant to be worn. If you can't stretch up without pain or tears your lobes aren't ready."
Stretched,30vv7c,homolicious,4,Tue Mar 31 08:11:39 2015 UTC,"Woaw your ears must not have alot  elasticity. I can not wear anything for weeks and just throw anything from 5/8 to 7/8 and be set. But i have rather stretchy ears.   To be 100% honest, if it was me, I would take it out and wait. If your unwilling to wait. Atleast take it out for the night, Salt bath it and keep an eye on it. See if you get discharge. Key is if it is painful then dont do it. It's not worth the scar tissue or blowouts. Also some advice would be to next time try doing it at the end of a hot shower. This will make your skin more relaxed and give it some extra stretch.   Source: I've been stretching for 7 years now."
Stretched,30vv7c,imjackslackofsuprise,2,Tue Mar 31 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"Take it back down, let it heal. Look at BAF or your preferred dealer of body jewelry and get some 1g items. 2g -> 0g is the largest jump out there and many people do not handle it well."
Stretched,30vv7c,youdoughgirl,2,Tue Mar 31 04:07:00 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't really be using tapers at this point anymore, because of this exact problem. A 2mm stretch is a lot and most people cannot handle it all at once without pain and tearing.  I second looking into 1g plugs instead or maybe look into the taping method where you use either ptfe tape or bondage tape and wrap 1 or 2 layers around your current jewelry every few days. But give your lobe more time to heal before doing either of these things.  Honestly, you should really downsize and slow down. I'm sure you've heard it before, but stretching is not a race and you should really take your time, regardless if this is your last stretch or not. Remember that the more scar tissue that you have and create, the harder it will be for your lobes to shrink back someday. And if one of your lobes has more scar tissue than the other, you have a big chance that they are going to be lobsided sizes which is going to look even weirder than having one at 2g and one at 0g like they are now. One might shrink down to say 8g or so and the other lobe with more scar tissue might only go to 4g (obviously this is just an example of what could happen, as everyone heals differently, but it's still 100% possible)  You really don't want to ruin the only lobes that you have, please take your time and treat them nicely. You definitely can't regret stretching too slow and really babying them, but you will if you really mess them up and are left with not many options to fix them later on."
Stretched,30vv7c,st0lenglances,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"If you ""don't really want to wait another month or two to try to size up again"" and want to just your ear heal weird and increase the risk of an infection, go for it. But stretching is a thing that needs patience, and honestly it'd be stupid to not size down. Buy some PTFE tape (plumbers tape, for pipe threads) and slowly wrap a layer or two every few days (or in your case every week) until you get to 0g. I was impatient to get to 0g and my ear got really irritated, don't repeat my mistake, patience is really important. Whatever you choose, I hope it goes well, but please consider listening to the people on here."

Stretched,30vls4,zack4565,4,Tue Mar 31 01:40:37 2015 UTC,I usually wear silicone plugs to the beach/pool (not earskins). I've lost metal ones because they've fallen out in the ocean and wood is not great with getting wet. My Kaos silicone plugs have never fallen out though and do well in the water. I can leave them in all vacation because they are so comfortable.

Stretched,30vls4,hazardtaco,3,Tue Mar 31 14:10:24 2015 UTC,I'd reccomend double flared glass so you don't have to worry about ruining porous plugs like wood and the double flare helps them stay in VS single flare with o rings that could fall off. Make sure to keep your ears extra lubricated with jojoba oil or some kind of oil since the salt will dry out your ears and could cause problems if you arent moisturizing them
Stretched,30u7uc,fruityloops17,2,Mon Mar 30 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"Having two stretched piercings next to each other won't increase your chances of a blowout, a blowout is created when you stretch too fast and the inside of your fistula goes out the back.  A cause for concern would be perhaps creating a thin spot between the two piercings if anything though. Definitely be careful and mindful of how much space is left between the two piercings.   And also as far as looks go, they might start to look kind of crowded if you stretch your bottom ones more, especially if you wear flared jewelry in each piercing, as the flare will give an added 1 or 2 mm around the front of each one.   Stretching to 0g probably won't have a huge effect on either matters, but I would maybe consider downsizing or taking the second ones out if you stretch to 00g or larger personally, but obviously the choice is completely up to you."
Stretched,30u7uc,st0lenglances,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"You've always gotta be really responsive with your body and take months or years to go up in size if it seems like your ears aren't responding well.

It sucks to wait but have some faith (: That being said your lobes still seem pretty thick so if you do it correctly you could have those lovely 00s you want."

I've had mine stretched to an 11mm for the past 6 years and my right lobe is the temperamental one. If I use low quality jewelry like acrylic for a few days without taking them out, I find my right lobe a bit swollen with that white gunk you have described.   That being said, I get white gunk on my lobes/jewelry whenever I go a few days without taking them out despite of the material of the jewelry but it seems to happen quicker and my lobes produce more white gunk with acrylic plugs in.   I've also found that if I sleep on one side more than the other or sleep in an odd position, the plug tends to irritate my lobe and it is exactly as you have described above, ESPECIALLY with acrylic plugs in. A little salt water soak, thorough drying and a bit of cocoa butter to moisturize and my lobe is back to normal!"
Stretched,30m9by,KREPharmD,4,Sat Mar 28 17:52:24 2015 UTC,"If you're stretching, there shouldn't be any damage to heal in the first place. It's more that you want to wait for the skin to become looser so you can stretch again. If your new jewelry goes in without pain or force, you've waited long enough.

Stretched,30gn75,paragoniq,6,Fri Mar 27 05:13:02 2015 UTC,"What are you in a hurry for? If you know it's best to wait (which you should wait 1-3 months between stretches) then why are you trying to push the limits? I highly suggest reading up on sites like BME to educate yourself better before taking this leap (again). You've attempted to go through this process a few times from your story but it only takes one mishap to ruin it.  There are methods like getting punched, or punch and taper to speed up the process, but will likely hurt your chances of ever going back down to a ""normal"" size. No two people's skin or experiences are going to be the same, but the general guidelines you'll find on places like BME and BAF are a great place to start and follow to the T until you learn what is best for your body.  Good luck, slow down, and please educate yourself more on this lifestyle (not trend or fad).  I'm going to add an edit here and say that you should give that 10g pierce/punch 6 months to heal like any other fresh piercing and treat it like a fresh piercing, since it is one."
Stretched,30gn75,youdoughgirl,2,Fri Mar 27 08:46:23 2015 UTC,"Not in a hurry at all, but half of the time they say ""it shouldn't hurt or feel uncomfortable and should go through easily; that's how you know you're ready"" - and so it didn't for me, though I still think I should wait (that's why I removed the 8gs regardless of not hurting).  I think a better way to phrase my question is: even if it doesn't hurt/feel uncomfortable/find resistance, should I do it or wait?"
Stretched,30gn75,youdoughgirl,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:07:33 2015 UTC,"You need to wait. Treat that 10g piercing as a fresh piercing, wait 6 months, then go to 8g. You should never feel severe pain, have blood or pus coming from your ears. It should at most feel like medium pressure like pinching the surface of your arm.  Sometimes ears are ready at different times. Sometimes one ear can become red and irradiated and the other one doesn't. Each person and each stretch is different. Look into other methods of stretching like using PTFE tape. That worked better for my body than tapers. Take a warm shower before each stretch to loosen the skin. Oil rub and lightly tug on your ears (with clean washed hands and while they're healed) to help loosen up skin. Take your time and when in doubt, WAIT."
Stretched,30gn75,miss_beredo,3,Sat Mar 28 00:33:36 2015 UTC,"If you had your ears re-pierced less than a month ago, you're nowhere near the point that you should be trying to stretch up yet. Fresh piercings need at least three months to heal (personally I would probably wait six to be safe.) before trying to stretch them. The first trauma hasn't healed yet, it's probably still got tons of small open areas, or areas without fully developed stretchy skin in there. Vaseline is also not really an appropriate lubricant. It's super thick, and will not allow the stretch to breathe, and may hold bacteria on your now open fistula. Vitamin E oil, Emu oil, or Jojoba oil are all appropriate lubricants, and are relatively inexpensive."
Stretched,30gn75,quenterror,2,Fri Mar 27 13:35:12 2015 UTC,"Everyone's ears are different and only you will know if your ears are ready. However, the longer you wait the more rewarding it will be and the happier your ears will be. Its really going to be up to your body so make sure you listen to it.   Good luck stretching and side note don't use Vaseline to stretch, get some a+d oil or some jojaba oil."

I've sized up and let my ears completely heal because I started when I was 11 and my parents didn't allow it. I continuously disobeyed them (they're just ears for crying out loud) and got to about a 00g size over the course of maybe 6 months in high school. I kept having to take them out and by the time I'd re-stretch they were healed. For my graduation (Fall 2014) my parents agreed to let me wear some small white plugs to go with my dress and told me they didn't care anymore since I was ""pretty much of-age.""  To answer your question on whether or not you should stretch your ears, ask yourself if you have thick/fat lobes? (if yes, go for it!)  Anyways the bottom line is I aways knew to take my time. It's been almost a year and I've been at 1/2"" for a few weeks now (stone plugs from BMA modified). My ears were very elastic from all the previous stretching and healing. My plugs fall out all the time because my ears are pretty healthy and I use Jojoba oil as often as possible but I still try to refrain from sizing up too quickly. I aim for nightly lobe massages. Jojoba massages help because as you rub your lobes, blood flow increases in them. This causes them to stay fat and the oil helps them stay healthy. It's also really useful for stretching as sometimes it gets you passed the flares. So maybe that will help you out. Anyways, best of luck with your lobes!"
Stretched,30gn75,birdfriend,1 point,Fri Mar 27 11:22:11 2015 UTC,"If you have significant scar tissue that prevents you from stretching, I think it's reasonable to get pierced at a larger gauge to remove it. I had my ears pierced with a gun when I was young and the scarring made it very difficult to wear earrings or stretch without tons of irritation. I had my ears pierced again at 6g. It took about 6 months for both ears to heal until it was flesh toned inside the fistula. (I had it pierced right before winter started so I assume the cold weather made the healing process slower).  I am currently stretching with the dead stretching method. No tapers, just rounded end glass plugs in the sizes I'm stretching to. I massage my ears a couple times of day. Every week or so I test putting in the next size. If there's ANY resistance or pain, I stop and stay at my same size. Dead stretching is a good way to prevent blowouts because you will be able to feel whether your piercing is ready to fit the next size or not."

Stretched,302k8l,karrottcake,13,Mon Mar 23 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"You might have a bit more scar tissue than someone who got their ears done with a needle, but I would say a good majority of people have probably gotten their lobes done with a gun because they didn't know better or it was their parents decision and have stretched their ears without any problems.   The thing to keep in mind with scar tissue is that it's thicker than your regular lobe tissue and it's not as elastic, therefore it might be a bit more stubborn and harder to work with. This is why it's so important to stretch slowly and take every precaution to not tear your lobes, because the more scar tissue you have built up, the more time your lobes will take to get to next size, and your chances of your lobes shrinking go down if you ever decide to let them close.   Definitely get some jewelry in 16g and do not skip it and go to 14g initially. Even if it's just a small stretch, you don't want to immediately start out by skipping a size. You more than likely won't need a taper either and the jewelry should be able to slide in. The cheapest route would probably be captive bead rings.  As far as stretching kits go, they usually are very poor quality and I would advise against them. Most of them are acrylic which is not a safe material to wear long term and is not safe for fresh stretches because it is porous, and a good amount of people are either allergic to it or have sensitivities with it. You can also develop an allergy to it over time which is also common. Silicone is also not suitable for stretching for similar reasons, as well as stone.  If you really want to get a stretching kit get one that is steel at least. It might be listed as ""stainless"" or ""surgical"" steel, but it's really called 316L grade. But know that this isn't good quality either and 316L can contain a good amount of nickel. Companies will try and pass it off as sounding like good quality by calling it surgical steel but those names do not mean anything. It's one of those ""try at your own risks"" deals. There's a good amount of people that can wear it without a problem, but others cannot wear it at all.   If you want metal, try to get implant grade titanium or steel. Stick with companies that are well known for their products like Anatometal and Industrial Strength.   There's also glass jewelry, which is awesome. It's the ideal material to wear when stretching your lobes and this is what I would recommend to look into instead of a kit. Gorilla Glass and Glasswear Studios both make color front single flared plugs which are great for initial stretches. Glass is not porous, it can be sterilized/autoclaved, and is very smooth. It also won't be nearly as expensive as implant grade metals but will have the same high quality.  So for the actual stretching process.  You'll want to get some oils and/or butters/balms. The most recommended oils are jojoba oil, vitamin e oil and emu oil. I love holey butter as well. You'll want to use the oils to massage your lobes everyday, and this will keep them moisturized and healthy. The massages will also help get your blood circulating through your lobes. The holey butter would be more for moisturizing them but I find that it keeps my lobes moisturized longer than just the oil.  The general concensus of time is waiting about 2 to 3 months in between every stretch. This ensures that your lobes are well healed and totally ready for a bigger size. Again, going back to the whole scar tissue thing, if you don't want long enough between stretches and your ears aren't ready, you risk tearing your lobes. And if you tear you lobe, you'll want to downsize one or two sizes which will set you back a few months which is never fun. It's always better to do things right the first time, rather than trying to rush and ruining your lobes.  As far as how to get to the next size, the best way to do it is by waiting until your lobes are ready. As in, don't even bother with tapers and wait for your lobes to naturally stretch themselves to the point where the next size up will be able to slide right in. This is why glass jewelry is great, because it's a slightly heavier material and it can aide in your lobes naturally stretching. Going this route might take a bit more time, but there's pretty much no way to harm your lobes because you're not forcing anything.   Or you can use the taping method which is wrapping plumber's tape/ptfe tape or bondage tape around your jewelry to gradually stretch. This doesn't quite work for smaller sizes though because it's very hard to work with on such a small area. You take your tape of choice, those two being the only suitable options, and wrap 1-3 layers around every few days, and oil it up really well until you get to the next size. You'll want to replace the tape everytime you add another layer, as you don't want to trap bacteria in between the layers. Some people find that their lobes get pretty dry when using plumber's tape so if you use that make sure to keep your lobes well moisturized.   If you want to use tapers though just be careful. Really make sure that your lobes are ready and if there is any resistance when stretching up, stop. Resistance and any kind of pain are both indicators that your lobes are not ready to stretch. It should never hurt, and there should never be any swelling or blood afterwards.   For aftercare, I use soap for my jewelry and water only for my lobes. I have never found a soap that doesn't leave a tight, dry feeling on my lobes. I take my jewelry out every shower, rinse my lobes, and put my clean jewelry back in.   I tried touching on everything that I could think of but I'm sure I left some stuff out on accident. If you want me to go into more detail about anything or if you're confused about anything, just ask!"
Stretched,302k8l,st0lenglances,3,Tue Mar 24 00:15:54 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for all the information. I'll definitely refer back to this for more things to research.
Stretched,301euz,st0lenglances,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:28:09 2015 UTC,I'm not a 00g but when I was at a 2g I had significant problems with size differences ranging anywhere from 6mm to 6.5mm. So if I would wear my smaller jewelry it would be hard to get my larger jewelry in and it was a real pain. 2g was my goal size but I eventually decided to size up to avoid this exact problem. If you don't want to size up then it really depends on the elasticity of your ears. My ears aren't very stretchy so even if I wore heavy plugs to dead stretch they would just shrink back up when I wore smaller plugs and I would have to do it again. It sounds like your ears aren't very stretchy so your best bet if you don't want to have to constantly re-stretch is to just size up to 10mm and wear only 10mm plugs.
Stretched,301euz,Araxias,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:53:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah my ears are definitely not very stretchy!

Stretched,301euz,Araxias,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:57:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you stretch up to 10mm and only wear 10mm plugs for a while your ears should loosen up quite a bit and you should be able to wear 9mm jewelry for short periods of time without having to worry about your ears shrinking."

I ended up finding a happy medium by buying a mix - I usually wear 14mm(9/16"") SF or 12/13mm DF. After allowing my lobes to sit comfortably at 14mm for around 6 months I found I have no trouble bouncing between sizes for short periods, and my lobes are pretty unstretchy - I still struggle with GG flares which sit at around 15mm on 13mm plugs. So maybe try 10mm in SF plugs and 9mm double flare ?"
Stretched,301euz,peachgin,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:55:31 2015 UTC,"Not far off the same size, but I was at 10mm and stretched to 11mm so I could get double flares in more easily (my lobes have never been very flexible).

Stretched,2ztp3j,KREPharmD,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:01:36 2015 UTC,"Downsize. At your size I'd probably recommend wearing 14-16ga until the inflammation goes down, just to keep the holes open. Seems scary, but once the inflammation goes away it's quite a quick process of sizing back up. Saline/SSS while it is an open wound, then oil massages when it is not. Do not attempt to stretch back to your starting size for a month. Once back to 10ga, do not try to stretch to 8ga until a taper will go through your ear with NO pain, burning, nothing.   The safest way forward is to ""dead stretch"", which is to wait so long until your ears have naturally loosened and you can just slip the next size up in there.  I experienced my first blowout when I sized up from 7/16"" to 1/2"". I had waited 5 or 6 months, and didn't experience any pain, just pulling and a slight burn. I had to take my jewellery out and size back up from 4ga. While that sounds terrible, I was back to 00ga within 3 weeks, and back to 7/16"" a month after that."

Stretched,2ztirw,Ripley5478,2,Sat Mar 21 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"Industrial Strength actually makes adapters for this specific reason.  These are also common to wear and are made for septums, but they are solid pieces.   I could only find clear eyelets but I guess color doesn't really matter if it's going to be mostly out of sight. Some the reviews said they really liked it, but others said it was slightly too large to wear a clicker through.   If you can find Kaos earskins or eyelets in 1/4 that could work too. Kaos unfortunately discontinued that wearable size and only make 5/16 now, but I've seen a few around bodyartforms still. Once they are sold out that's it though.  Plugs and eyelets that are made for lobes typically have a wearable length of 5/16 and have larger flares, while the same jewelry for septums commonly have a wearable length of 1/4 with very small flares. That's the biggest thing to look out for when buying septum jewelry.   Edit: It looks like there are quite a few 6g and 4g in white left. I'm not sure if that color would be pretty noticable or not though."

Stretched,2zqsgy,f0xish,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:31:17 2015 UTC,"Well yes, as the 2g is of course smaller that 0g, but they would shrink every time you switched back to wearing the 2g.   Perhaps you could only wear the 2g while you are working, but that wouldn't really work until you've been at 0g for a while, at least a few months. I would assume it would be similar to sleeping without your jewelry in, once you've been at a size for a little while it's not a big deal to not wear jewelry and your lobes won't shrink back within just a few hours.   I wouldn't suggest stretching to 0g, and then needing to put your 2g in a week later though. They will definitely shrink if not given enough time to heal/be at that size for a while and you'll need to restretch them back to 0g every time.  What you could also do, is buy some Kaos earskins and wear the 2g through the 0g ones though. But this is also only for healed lobes, as silicone is not a safe material for new stretches. It's porous like acrylic and your lobe can essentially heal into it as its healing the skin."
Stretched,2zqsgy,st0lenglances,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"I've found the best way to stretch when a job doesn't approve is to wear weights outside of work and just maintain the size you're at.

Stretched,2z74gi,Staymetal11,2,Mon Mar 16 03:49:34 2015 UTC,"Scar tissue may have made your lobes stretch easier the second time around. I know that when I stretched for my second time, it was much easier. You may also be experiencing dead-stretching, when your lobes basically stretch on their own.  To prevent blowouts, you can't skip sizes or force anything into your lobes that isn't ready to go in. Take your time, stretching is a lengthy process that does require patience. It took me much longer than a year to reach my goal of 1-inch. Once you get past 9/16"" or so, I recommend using the taping method to stretch rather than using tapers. Use teflon tape. You can get it here or basically at any store. This helps to prevent blowouts because it's a more gradual method of stretching. It gives your lobes more time rather than forcing in a taper all at once. This is especially recommended for bigger sizes. It is a slower process, but it's safer. While stretching, if you feel any pain or see any bleeding, or if your lobes are secreting anything other than sebum, it's a sign that you're going too fast and your lobes need more time.  Massaging your lobes with jojoba oil daily can help to thicken your lobes. The massage part is important because it gets the blood flowing, and the jojoba oil can help to reduce scar tissue and thicken your lobes if you do it often enough. You can a regular bottle of it here, or you could use what I use, which includes jojoba oil and a few other types of beneficial oils that are good for your lobes. It's only $10 and has lasted me well over a year with daily use. It's also great to use a lubricant for stretching, and for healing lobes."
Stretched,2z74gi,wxnderwall,2,Mon Mar 16 06:10:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the response! I never thought about scar tissue being the reason for the easy stretching, it makes sense. Thankfully, I've learned from my past mistakes and wont be skipping sizes and will be taking my time. Thank you for all the links, I really appreciate your help!"
Stretched,2z74gi,thrownormanaway,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"Your lobes don't have muscle memory as it were. Skin is elastic, so think of it like a woman's belly after having a baby. It gets really stretched out and then, when the baby's out of there, it shrinks back down and seems to tighten up but it never goes back to being as fully tight as it once was. Same with lobes, in a sense. When you stretched your ears you actually ended up gaining additional tissue in the process, so that tissue might get more compact but it'll never really go away unless you have a visit with a plastic surgeon. That's why you are able to stretch back up way more easily. And the way you described how the jewelry just slid right in? That's how stretches should feel. If there's resistance, wait and try again at a later time.   As with all things in life, don't rush it.   PS: I agree with the other poster about massage. Healthy tissue begets healthy tissue but I will note that there's unfortunately no way to make your lobes drastically thicker. Best I can offer is to take it easy on stretches (wearing jewelry that's rather loose within reason), wear light jewelry, and do massages. It could take a while to see results.  Edit to add PS"
Stretched,2z8bsr,JessicaRahbbit,5,Mon Mar 16 13:44:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say let your lobe go naked for a bit and it should shrink up enough to keep your plugs in. Try it in increments though so they don't shrink up too much. So like leave your plugs out for 4 hours, then 8 if 4 doesn't work, etc."

Stretched,2yugj8,lizzymonster,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:30:37 2015 UTC,I think you're going to have trouble finding a lot of choice at that size. Personally I'd get something plain in 7mm and stretch up to 8mm when you can (without knowing your eventual goal).  The only 7mm  jewellery I've found are tunnels not plugs (or occasionally large gauge rings or spirals) - from ouchbodyjewellery.co.uk or fleshtunnel.co.uk (both in the UK. I've ordered from both before and they've been ok).
Stretched,2yugj8,peachgin,1 point,Fri Mar 13 11:34:44 2015 UTC,I needed a 1G taper and plugs to stretch because the taping method just does not work for me and I didn't want to make a 2mm jump. I had a really hard time finding anything at all. Not sure if you're at a 1G or you are planning to stretch to that size but if you're planning on stretching then I would just wear plain steel tunnels (I found mine on Amazon) or some glass plugs from bodyartforms until you could stretch to 0G. If you didn't want to go that big I would personally stay at 2g because you're going to have a really hard time trying to find anything like that picture or anything other than plain glass or steel tunnels unless you have all your jewelery custom made. If you're already at 1G and want to stay that size then I would recommend finding some good reputable custom jewelery makers and have your jewelery custom made if you want more unique designs.

Stretched,2yugj8,smackfromthezack,2,Fri Mar 13 04:02:22 2015 UTC,Fair point. I thought they were currently at 7mm so moving up to 8 wouldn't put a lot of stress on the ears and there would also be more options for jewelery available.

My ears are 2"" after 10 years because I was a very impatient teenager who decided this ONE THING was worth being patient for. It's really put a lot of time and waiting related things into perspective.   Until you've got it down, don't buy any earrings in the next size (or more) up. When your current ones are always falling out, start taping them LESS than you think you need to, and order the next size up. This bit of advice comes from personal experience :\"
Stretched,2ym8ek,2-22-15,3,Wed Mar 11 02:37:17 2015 UTC,"I'm at 8g as well, but I think two things would help with impatience.  1) Try NOT to have a goal size at this point. If I think a lot about 1/2"" ears (which I would like to have), it seems like it's going to be an eternity, whereas if I think more about the next size up, time is not as big of a deal.   2) Have something comfortable and good looking in your ears now. If you're satisfied with how they feel and look (aside from size), it's easier to be patient.  Hope that helps!"

When I made the decision to go bigger, I did go to 0g and then 00g within 6 months, and then to an inch in about another year after that. I then sat at an inch for a couple of years, after which I've stretched up gradually over 10 years to 2 5/8 inches (67mm)."

Started stretching again in March 2014 and - by listening to my body when it came to the elasticity and health of my lobes - made it to 1"" in February 2015. Keep in mind, however, I'm definitely a fiddler when it comes to my jewelry and I essentially bought plugs in 1 or 2 mm increments to make the stretches as gradual and healthy for my lobes as possible. I've had friends do it in 6mo-1yr before and let me tell ya, their lobes are just disgusting.

Stretched,2ygz25,ELSockems,3,Mon Mar 9 19:09:19 2015 UTC,"Though many people do like the taping method, I wasn't much a fan. After getting to 0g (I used tapers beforehand, and though it went okay, I'm happier with other methods), I started dead stretching. Basically, with this method, you just make sure your ears are as happy as possible (daily jojoba oil massages help!) and wear heavy glass plugs. Over time, your ears will stretch naturally, and eventually you'll be able to just slip the next size in. In my case, from 8mm to 14mm, I was able to go about 1mm to 1.5mm every 2 months. I found this way easier than tape, since taping requires lots of maintenance - constantly making sure your ears don't dry out, retaping your plugs, etc. I did a bad job at it and my ears weren't happy with me, so dead stretching was definitely something I was able to do more gracefully."
Stretched,2ygz25,rpgoof,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:56:32 2015 UTC,"OK, thank you. I'm not sure dead stretching is for me as my ears don't have too much natural stretch to them anyway..  Thank you for taking the time to reply"
Stretched,2ygz25,_littlehelll,2,Mon Mar 9 23:20:40 2015 UTC,"I personally like the taping method.  To use this method, purchase a roll of PTFE (Teflon) (hardware store) or bondage tape (adult shop). Once your lobes are completely healed, take out your current jewelry and put one or two wraps of tape around it, then reinsert the jewelry in your ear. You can do this every few days as your ear adjusts to each new wrap of tape - thus gradually stretching your piercing up to the next size. While this method works quite well for many people, some people find that the Teflon tape gets stuck/attached to the inside of their ear after insertion, thus making removal of the jewelry significantly more difficult. If this happens, you can also try bondage tape. Remember, slow stretching and long healing times are key to healthy lobes.  Do not attempt to use duct tape, electrical tape, or other industrial or household tapes. They contain chemicals in the base tape material and adhesive that are toxic and can cause nasty skin reactions."

I personally prefer bondage tape because it's easier to work with than PTFE, but it's honestly up to you. Just take it slow, and don't work your ears more than they can handle. If you use PTFE, make sure to use oil like Vitamin E to lube up the tape often, or like _littlehelll said, the tape will get stuck inside your ear. Good luck! :)"
Stretched,2yeuu8,forthewimd,5,Mon Mar 9 05:00:11 2015 UTC,"Try inserting the jewelry from the back, and then leave it there for a few hours. Then you should have no trouble taking it out and putting it back in from the front.  My right lobe gets unhappy when I upsize, so that's what I do.   Also, what lube are you using? Maybe try a different lube."
Stretched,2yeuu8,suulia,3,Mon Mar 9 14:08:42 2015 UTC,"I second this. My ears were pierced with a gun at an odd angle, so when I started stretching, I put my plug in from the back to open it up, then put it through the front and had no problem.

Your ear might have been pierced at an angle so when you put the next size up in, you are putting it in a slightly different angle so the end isn't coming out.

I've had my ears pierced before at regular earring size and it honestly didn't hurt that much worse. As far as the healing goes, I'm not entirely sure.

The day after Warped Tour I went to another summer camp (one where I had loads of free time to shower when I pleased)"
Stretched,2y8sb4,Weakends,3,Tue Mar 17 14:26:16 2015 UTC,Glass is non-porous so it will be the best for keeping your ears clean. Stone and wood are porous so ear gunk will accumulate in the pores which is why your ears get nasty. Steel is also known for making ears cheesy. I like to go with single flare glass plugs with an o-ring on the back. You could go with 2 o-rings if you're concerned about losing an o-ring.

Stretched,2y8sb4,traininsane,2,Sun Mar 8 04:43:27 2015 UTC,"In my experience wood is the best for extended wear time, so I second this. Glass gets goopy if not cleaned regularly. Wood will keep your ears dry and its lightweight so you don't have to worry about it falling out and breaking."
Stretched,2y8sb4,Kalistar,2,Sun Mar 8 19:44:42 2015 UTC,"Glass, baby wipes to clean and a tiny bit of coconut oil on after. Coconut oil has some antimicrobial properties and I find that it keeps the nasty at bay for longer than without."
Stretched,2y8sb4,sentient66,2,Sun Mar 8 00:50:47 2015 UTC,"I was gonna suggest glass, but you'll probably react the same as stone.  Have you ever tried silicone? I honestly love it when I'm outdoors. No smell, comfy. Bring wet wipes in any case."
Stretched,2y8sb4,goldenjuicebox,5,Sat Mar 7 15:54:40 2015 UTC,"Glass if definitely the best option! Silicon is porous. It'll absorb all of the gunk from hiking and be a pain to clean.   Glass is very easy to clean and hypoallergenic. All it needs is a little water and a soft cloth to clean it off. Hell, I use my tshirt in times of need.

Stretched,2y0yv4,dinozgorur,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"Shit. Just recently I completely tore the fistula in what I'm assuming was a blowout (tldr, felt panicky, took tapers out after what looked like a blowout. Fistula was torn into a front, and back half) And I just let both ears just close up and heal over these last few days. So far everything is looking and feeling good.   Are you saying I really should have downsized instead of letting them close?"
Stretched,2y0yv4,Starshiee,1 point,Fri Mar 13 06:17:39 2015 UTC,"Most people downsize to let the stretch heal but they don't want to lose all their progress. They'll usually downsize one or two sizes. Letting it close in theory isn't bad in terms of healing it just might be harder to re-stretch, you'd have to essentially start over depending how much it closed up. Also if you tore it badly it could have caused scar tissue which would make re-stretching difficult.  I would try to put a SMALL non-flare plug in if you can manage, if there is still a hole. I would leave it to heal that way for a couple months. If you're able to do that after a couple months you could revisit stretching. DO NOT use a taper, that's how most blowouts happen. Try naturally stretching the hole by pulling on the plug throughout the day for a month or so at a time, this is how I went from an 8 to a 0. It is very gentle on your ears and stretches them gradually. When your ears are ready they will be naturally stretched to the next size and the next size should go in rather easily, you can keep repeating that process til' you're at your goal.  Edit: I didn't go directly from an 8 to 0, just want to clarify I did not skip sizes."
Stretched,2y0yv4,dinozgorur,2,Fri Mar 13 06:36:32 2015 UTC,"When I sized up to 1/2"", I gave my bitch ear a slight blowout. It wasn't huge by any means, but it looked weird from the back and you could tell it just wasn't right. I knew I should've waited another week or two, but I was eager to size up. I babied that ear and did the daily jojoba oil massages and after a week or two the blowout went away, and even today it looks just as good as my other ear. This was my only blowout and I don't have much experience in these matters, but hopefully my anecdote helps."
Stretched,2y0yv4,rpgoof,2,Thu Mar 5 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"Being (very)uneducated about stretching, I got stretched to 10mm on my first ever stretch. Obviously ended up with blow outs on both of my ears. I had my ears blown out for about 3 months, after which upon doing some research I began to massage my ears with vitamin e oil, and just a month after doing sea salt soaks and rubbing my ears with vit e oil, the blow outs were gone like they never been there. Now my ears look perfect. That is my personal experience."

If they bother you while sleeping, you could most likely attempt to go a few hours without any plugs and see if they tighten or shrink at all.

I received the first order, and then sent them an e-mail inquiring about the second, which I had not received a shipping notification for.  Instead of a reply, a got a shipping notification informing me that the pre-shipping information was sent to UPS. Okay, fine. It's going to be super late, whatever, maybe they had just forgotten about it, but it's coming.  Another week later, the UPS page still said that the item had not yet been shipped. So now, a MONTH after I ordered, I sent them another e-mail asking about the order.  They THEN inform me that their supplier is no longer making the item that I ordered (however, to this day, that item is still on their website).  They refunded me in store credit, so I ordered a different item, and asked them if they would honor my original BOGO purchase and include an extra pair. Of course their answer was no. So after making me wait a month to find out that they can no longer make a certain item (which is probably a lie, since it's still on the website), they end up giving me store credit of lesser value. Super irritating.  So after I ordered another pair, I ended up with an extra $10, and I don't want to support their sketchy ass business any more, so I'm giving it away."
Stretched,2xn71l,stale-scrotum-sponge,2,Mon Mar 2 06:07:33 2015 UTC,"The problems with this is that stone jewelry isn't really recommended for fresh stretches and that the jewelry is double flared.   Stone is porous and as your lobe heals, it can essentially heal into the jewelry as well. If you're trying to go the natural stretching route, glass is a better option, at least for the initial fresh. You can wear stone after your lobe has healed up. Hematite is the heaviest jewelry you can get also.  I highly suggest you don't try and put the double flared jewelry in. Only single flared or no flared jewelry is okay for fresh stretches. The flares are typically huge like you mentioned and if you try and put them in, you're basically stretching your ear twice. I would not take the other taper just to make the jewelry fit in. Even if you get them in now, you'll need to take them out eventually right? If your ear wasn't stretchy enough originally to get them in and out with ease, you might have a piece of jewelry stuck in your ear lobe, and at that point you won't be able to use a taper to make the hole bigger to get them out again. You're going to create a lot of unnecessary trauma to your ears doing that.   I would look into single flared glass by Glasswear Studios or Gorilla Glass. Also, if you're ever stuck between two sizes, Glasswear Studios makes a lot of odd sizes like 11g, 9g, etc."

Stretched,2xn71l,wxnderwall,1 point,Mon Mar 2 06:36:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, you could. Your best bet while stretching up (at the smaller sizes, anyway), is to use single-flare plugs that are glass or surgical steel (or titanium). I personally see nothing wrong with using tapers to ease insertion, although others here disagree.  When you get over an inch, the weight of the jewelry does tend to cause them to self-stretch.

Let me just say these glass tunnels are my favorite jewelry I've ever put in my ears. Glass is one of the best materials, as you can read almost anywhere on this sub. Probably my favorite thing though is the weight of them. I wore tunnels up to 2g and I feel like that may have been part of the reason my lobes tightened up.

Stretched,2xhk40,maimonides,7,Sun Mar 1 01:04:59 2015 UTC,"Get a roll of PTFE plumbers tape from Lowe's/Home Depot/etc., it costs like a dollar or two.   Cut a strip off the roll and line it up with the plug. Begin rolling the plug up with the tape. When you being stretching just start with one or two layers, or complete wraps, of tape around the plug. Liberally apply oil of choice (Jojoba for me) to the plug until the white tape starts to turn almost see through. Insert the plug in your lobe and you're done for the first day!   After that continue to oil the plug with the tape on it. I usually leave the plug in my ear when I oil it, some people take it out to oil it too. Once a few days has passed and the plug+tape is fairly loose in your ear you're ready to go up a little more!   Now take out the plug and take off the old tape (some people add new tape on top of the old tape, it's your call, but the cleanest way is the safest way imo..), and cut a new strip of tape. This time wrap the same number of wraps you had previously, plus one or two more. So if you were at two wraps, now wrap it three or four times. Repeat the liberal oiling, and place back in your ear.  Taping is supposed to be a slow and gradual process with little to no trauma. If you take your time and go slowly you won't even feel like you're stretching, you'll just be at the next size one day. There's no real time limit to any of this, listen to your body. One stretch took me only a week and a half of taping to get to the next size. Sometimes it takes me up to three weeks. Whereas tapers will do it in one second. But with taping you'll get thick, healthy, good looking lobes.  Sorry for the hugegantic text post, but I hope I could help out OP."

A lot of their styles are similar to Tawapa and made out of brass.  Personally, my ears are fine with brass but I'm sure there are people here that will tell you not to wear it as it is not the BEST material for your ears.  I feel the same way about brass as I do about acrylic - it doesn't bother me personally, and I wear it short term.  I haven't personally bought from this seller but I do have some of their plugs on my wishlist.  Stacia on Etsy also has some awesome stuff but since it's silver, the prices run higher and maybe even more than Tawapa in some cases.  However, the Tawapa ones are seriously worth the money, I always wait for coupon days but they are some of my favorites."

Stretched,2xbh05,BakerELMT,8,Fri Feb 27 04:27:18 2015 UTC,"The only tape that I have used is PTFE tape. I personally never had a problem with it becoming too dry and a big reason I like it is because the width of the tape is already the perfect size and you only need to cut it lengthwise. With bondage tape you typically need to cut it length and width. I believe that PTFE tape is thinner than bondage also. It's just a personal preference though, people swear by either one or the other usually.    I would wrap 1 or 2 layers around my single flared jewelry every maybe 2 or 3 days. Every time you add another wrap, you'll want to replace all of the tape too. If you don't, you'll be trapping all of the bacteria and gunk in between every new layer and that can really cause some problems with possible infection, not mention that it's would just be gross in general. You could replace all of the tape everyday if you wanted to as well. And just because you need or want to replace the tape doesn't necessarily mean you need to add another layer if you don't feel like it. I would recommend taking them out when you shower too, so that they don't get all wet and absorb all that moisture.   Also just a tip, i would always forget how many layers I would be at after taping for a week or two, so I made a note in my phone with little tally marks to keep track of how many I was at, haha. And then to keep track of where every layer was on the jewelry, I would use my fingernail and make an indent mark on the back (like where you'd have the o-ring) every time the tape would overlap so I could make sure all of the layers were even if that makes sense.  Another thing that I liked to do was use two pairs of jewelry instead of taping just one pair if possible. As I was wearing my current taped jewelry, I would pre-wrap the other pair so it was ready when I needed it. I would usually pre-tape it before I got in the shower so I didn't need to put my old dirty pair back in after I just cleaned my lobes and had to fiddle around with taping the other pair."

Stretched,2x0z3f,webbedjoes,3,Tue Feb 24 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, most advice on things like blowouts and tears and avoiding catbutt is to downsize, probably back to 3mm, then give it 3-6 months to completely heal. That number varies from person to person because everybody heals differently, so the important part is to listen to your body, it'll tell you when it's time. Shoot for 3 months minimum.  Once you're at the point where you can take the downsized plugs out for cleaning, you should be massaging your ears daily with oil to help break up any scar tissue that might form, so your ears will get super healthy and be happy to stretch.  And I get it if you're thinking 3-6 months is a long wait, but your lobes will thank you for the patience."

Also, what oils are you using? Vitamin e oil is a lot thicker than jojoba and I feel that it stays on longer.   I like holey butter as well like mentioned but the only thing to keep in mind with that is it's not very slippery like oil so it's definitely more of a moisturizer than a lubricant. You can of course use both though, like maybe the oil after you wrap them and the holey butter any other time you might need some extra moisture."

Aside from having an irritation with them I'm not quite sure what else would cause something like that if you've been at the same size for a little while now. You could try and experiment with a different pair of jewelry and see if the irritation goes away. That's how I figured out the o-rings were the cause of my irritation."

You can buy a cheap set of calipers (I got some plastic ones at a craft store for like three bucks) and measure jewelry before you buy it (or, of course, if you're buying jewelry at a piercing shop, they should have calipers on hand). As for internet shopping, many shops will have the measurements on the listing...if they don't, you can ask.

All you have to do is put the size jewelry that your piercing is at, glass plugs, and wait. The fistula will open up given the weight of the plugs. With time, you can slip the next size in without tapers.  Using tapers, you will be risking tearing the ear. If you do this and allow those tears to heal, your ear will grow scar tissue and this will make further stretching difficult, requiring more time for the fistula to stretch on its own."

Stretched,2wti50,comicsansrocks,13,Mon Feb 23 00:54:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here much prefer the taping method(wrapping the tape around the jewelry) or by wearing a heavier material like glass and wait for the lobe to naturally stretch itself over time until you can fit the next size in. The second option with glass is the best way to stretch by far since you're not forcing anything at all.   You never want to force anything because that's when you have the potential to tear your lobe and create scar tissue of course. You never want any pain at all during stretching and while it might not hurt with a taper, if you have any sort of resistance at all, you're forcing the stretch a bit. A lot of people might say ""it didn't hurt and there was some slight resistance when I stretched, and now x days later my lobes are super pissed"", and that's because they weren't ready yet.   Typically when people use tapers they use either a cheap kit or buy cheap tapers whether they are acrylic or low quality steel. Here is a comparison of cheap vs high quality tapers.  Now, they both are low quality steel (I would assume because they are not made to be worn), but the shape of the taper is quite different between the two as you can see. The cheap tapers might have an elongated shape to them, but the actual stretch portion is pretty blunt which can easily result in a tear. As for the tapers made by industrial strength, you can't even see any stretching portion since it's so gradual. They also have a concave front to them to fit your plug into them a bit for easier insertion. Most people are not willing to spend the money on good tapers like these though.   In my opinion you're better off buying a pair of single flared glass plugs in each size and just waiting until your lobes are totally ready. It will definitely take longer to get to your goal but stretching is not a race. Patience is key to happy and healthy lobes and you want to do it right the first time around.   I tore one of my ears before and I literally doubled the stretching time for myself by being impatient. What could/should have taken me about 2 1/2ish years to get to 00g, took me almost 4 instead because I had to let my lobes heal completely. So I would say do yourself a favor and just take your time, there's no rush especially when it comes to the health of your body."
Stretched,2wti50,st0lenglances,3,Mon Feb 23 03:24:30 2015 UTC,I can't stress enough how true this post is.   Tapers are bad news.
Stretched,2wti50,findanewpiercer,2,Mon Feb 23 03:59:22 2015 UTC,this is insanely amazing post. I still have a few questions. I see that cheap tapers are bad but what about to start out? my ears are at an 18g right now so the smallest taper/plug I can find is a 14. would using a taper just to get me to a 14 be a bad idea? and then just stretch naturally or with tape from there?
Stretched,2wti50,st0lenglances,3,Mon Feb 23 04:23:48 2015 UTC,"I would maybe suggest wearing something like this perhaps. Going from 18g to 14g would mean that you're skipping the 16g stretch and like you said, you're probably not going to find a taper or plug style jewelry at 16g.   You probably won't need a taper going from 18g to 16g because the size difference is very small honestly, just make sure you get some jewelry that either doesn't have threading or that it is internally threaded rather than externally. The difference between the two can be seen here  It's pretty much your decision if you want to do it completely natural or if you want to use tape. At your smaller sizes up until about  8g you probably won't need to tape and can use just the glass jewelry. At 8g to 6g, that is the first 1mm stretch and where some people start to find a bit of resistance. Then like in my other comment, 2g and on for the most part will be 2mm stretches.  If you haven't already you'll want to invest in some oils or butters for your lobes too. Jojoba oil and vitamin e oil seem to be the most common but emu oil and bio oil are recommended sometimes too. You'll want to massage your lobes with the oil everyday and it will keep them nice and moisturized. Doing the massages will help loosen up your lobes and help you get to the next size faster as well. Holey butter is awesome for keeping your lobes moisturized too.   Also, the company Glasswear Studios makes a lot of in between sizes like 11g, 9g, etc. If you're ever finding difficulty with any stretch you can try those out. It looks like most of the custom sizes are mainly for preorder though on bodyartforms.com. Here's a link for the plugs."

The biggest reason of why it is important to avoid acrylic in a fresh piercing/stretch is because it is porous, which means bacteria can build up a lot easier and cause infections.  If you are a lucky one it can potentially become one with your ears.  Most people avoid acrylic because it can more easily cause irritation when wearing the jewelry and a bunch of other bad stuff.  I recommend watching this video to get a better idea of plastic jewelry in general.  A comment made before me said something about ""acrylic nazi's"".  Just saying there is a reason that I avoid and generally recommend avoiding acrylic.  We care about your ear health, just like a nutritionist will probably not recommend you eating choclate if you want to be healthy.

If you rush it, you might suffer a blowout and/or infection which only makes you have to wait longer to size up.  The general consesus on acrylic is that it is mainly bad for you. While you may not have had problems, again better safe than sorry. Glass and steel are typically the best to use in fresh stretches and if it's going to be temporary size. Glass I feel is smoother than still sometimes, but steel (Good high quality steel) is bit cheaper than glass. I like silicone (Kaos only) because it's super light, it is flexible which is good if you wear headphones for extended periods, and they have a range of colors to choose from.   In my experience, even at a fresh stretch the plug/tunnel should be able to spin freely. Even if you think it's healed, it doesn't really mean it is ready for the next size.  Happy stretching!"

Stop skipping sizes unless your lobes really are like silly putty.  And don't wear double flares to stretch...that's like skipping two sizes.  Don't use silicone to stretch up either. Use jojoba or vitamin E oil or ""holey butt'r"" to stay ~plump & moisturized.   You've gone from 14g to 6g in like a month?  I would be very surprised if your lobes aren't looking cat butty already.  :/  Please do some more homework before you keep shoving stuff in your ears. www.stretched.livejournal.com is fairly dead but there's a ton of info there."

It took me a year and a half just to get to 1g because my lobes were so inelastic, and while I know I was slower than the norm, being at 6g from 14g in a month just seemed crazy-fast to me. For 0g all the way to 1/2"" (where I'll likely stay), I had to wait months between sizes and then take super-hot showers to stretch up. Anyway, I always love glass.

When I was at 0g (was there for about seven years), solid glass pieces are barely noticeable at all. My ears didn't swing side to side or anything!  Another option for once your ears are FULLY healed to get a black solid plug look would be stone (maybe some nice black agate?) or Kaos (only Kaos brand-they are the only safe silicone) silicone solid black plugs.  Good luck on your stretching journey! You can find all these goodies on bodyartforms.com, my favorite body jewelry shop of choice. Great prices, great selection, and great quality jewelry (if you know what to buy...Glasswear Studios was mentioned, another good glass company is Gorilla Glass. Kaos is the only silicone you'll want to buy (and the only one BAF stocks).

Kaos is the only company that works with implant grade silicone that is proven safe enough to wear as body jewelry. Other non name companies use low grade silicone that has no industry standard so you have no idea what you're really buying. The same concept as stainless steel/surgical steel vs implant grade titanium or implant grade steel. Implant grade is what you always want for body jewelry.   A way to know if you have kaos or not if you're unsure, is to look on one of the sides near the flare and it will have the Kaos brand logo and the gauge size.  Silicone can also be a bit drying since it's porous, so make sure to use some safe oils or maybe some holey butter before you put them in!"

Stretched,2w83h5,so0ks,1 point,Thu Feb 19 01:45:14 2015 UTC,"Very true. Everybody's body is made differently, so we're all not going to react the same to a material. Much like how some people can wear lower grade metals no problem, and others can very bad reactions. Kaos is the only reputable maker on the market right now, and if you have issues with their jewelry, it's just not a material that works for you.  Personally, I have no problems wearing Kaos eyelets for weeks like my glass or stone plugs, but that also doesn't mean someone else can."
Stretched,2w83h5,wxnderwall,1 point,Tue Feb 24 03:20:56 2015 UTC,"Silicone is okay for healed lobes, usually. Some people get itchiness or redness from cheap silicone if they leave it in for too long. For example, I do, and this is the first sign of your ears rejecting the material. I only wear silicone for maximum 12 hours or so, and when I take them out I always apply this, but any jojoba or vitamin E oil will work. I only go to sleep with steel or stone plugs.   You should be fine, as long as your lobes are fully healed, and as long as you only wear them for short periods of time and clean your ears when you're done, or apply healing oil. Also, never stretch using silicone or acrylic."

Stretched,2w348u,LeannaBard,5,Mon Feb 16 16:08:01 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've had a lot of trouble stretching my ears too. I'll just tell you my story so you don't feel alone.I've been stretching my ears since I was 15 years old, and I'm 19 now. For the past year I've been stuck at 5/8"" because my ears just won't go.   My first stretch was from a regular piercing to an 8g because I was stupid and didn't know anything about proper stretching methods. I used acrylic tapers and plugs. The next morning, my ears and lymph nodes were so inflamed, and blood was dripping from my ears. I went to the doctor and was told if I had waited another day, I would have had to go to the hospital.   While letting my ears heal, I found this subreddit and used it as a guide for stretching. I bought myself some orange Dial soap, H2Ocean, Holey Butt'r, and every time I stretched I bought myself steel tapers and plugs. I didn't really have a set time between stretches. I just waited until the holes looked healthy and the plugs had a lot of extra room in my ear. If it hurt at all, I stopped and tried again later.  When I got to 0g and 00g, I had a lot of trouble stretching. I tore my ears on both sizes, and had to downsize back to 4g and 2g respectively. They just wouldn't go. I ended up doing something against this subreddit, and I stretched with silicone tunnels on both sizes. It worked, yes, but my ears were always so crusty and the plugs would get stuck to my ears. I switched my plugs to glass at 00g, and it was a world of difference. My ears healed up quicker, and I found that with the weight of the glass they were a lot easier to stretch. I tried the taping method, but my ears are naturally dry so the tape sucked up all the moisture.   The next few sizes were a breeze with either stainless steel tapers or dead stretching with stone, steel, or glass plugs. I finally worked my way up to 5/8"" and had healthy lobes. I considered myself done until I was gifted a pair of beautiful 3/4"" plugs. Every month for the past year, I've tried to stretch for them. My ears just won't budge anymore. It's possible that I damaged them with so many fuck ups happening early on. I guess some people just don't have naturally stretchy ears. :(  Just don't force it. Unless your ears are like mine you should be able to get to a larger size. Good luck!"
Stretched,2w348u,birdfriend,3,Mon Feb 16 22:14:26 2015 UTC,"You could always let your holes heal and get repierced or punched at a larger size.   I wanted big ears and went too fast. Now I can't go any bigger without my ears being too thin, or be for sure that my ears will shrink if needed because of scar tissue. I was an idiot and went straight to a four from a regular ear piercing. That's probably as small as my ears will ever shrink now because of my impatience."
Stretched,2w348u,latenightrage,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:15:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think that would help anything. that would just make it take longer, and getting punched seems like it would cause more scar tissue."

Stretched,2w348u,st0lenglances,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"I don't plan to. My goal is just 2g right now, and my goal isn't necessarily to get it done ASAP.

Stretched,2w348u,jules_am,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:27:19 2015 UTC,It would clear a lot of the difficult stretches. Other than that I don't know how else to try to help you.
Stretched,2w348u,jules_am,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"Yup this is embarrassing to admit but when I first started stretching I went from <20g (I hadn't worn earrings in years) to 14g in less than a month due to a series of terrible decisions. I had a blowout in one ear and lots of discharge. I took the plugs out and let them heal, which took around 3 months. I ended up scabby ears with a lot of scar tissue at the back. I had them repierced at 6g to remove the scar tissue. It's been 3+ months since getting them pierced again and they are still red on the inside so I probably have 2 more months to go? So not the quickest shortcut if you're a slow healer like me, but it does avoid having to buy a lot of intermediate sizes and you get to be at whatever size you're pierced win from the get go."
Stretched,2w348u,rpgoof,2,Thu Feb 19 13:55:31 2015 UTC,"Are you using stainless steel tapers and steel or glass plugs? If not, buy some. If every stretch is giving you an infection, then try sanitizing/sterilizing your tapers and plugs before each stretch. If this still doesn't work, I would seek advice from a local piercer. They may even stretch for free if you have your own jewelry. The place by me does that."
Stretched,2w348u,findanewpiercer,2,Mon Feb 16 16:33:31 2015 UTC,"I use stainless steel. I use alcohol to soak my tapers and jewelry before I put them in, and they come in individual bags with a kit, so they should be sterile when I open them. I also clean my hands thoroughly before I start. I am very prone to infections (I have had staph infections several times in my life) and I think my ears are just tearing.   There is no way I would let someone else do the stretch for me. If I feel any pain, I stop because I know my ears aren't ready yet. A piercer won't know when to stop until I tell them and they've already torn my ear. If I can't get it in myself without trouble, there is nothing a piercer could do to help. Not to mention, I've heard to many horror stories about piercing shops stretching for people. I really don't understand what a piercer could do that you can't do yourself. Although I might stop by my local tattoo/piercing place and get some of their H2Ocean spray to help prevent further infections.   What I have come to now is just waiting so long that I either dead stretch, or use the taper just for a little extra help, but not so much that there is any chance of my hole not being ready. My ears are not stretchy at all, so this is going to take way longer than I had anticipated. It might not be so bad once I get into the larger sizes, but at a 12g, I feel like I'm getting nowhere and I get so tired of looking at the same bland tunnels for months, but I can't afford to buy jewelry for such small sizes. It's just incredibly irritating. I'm going to need to take up meditating or something."
Stretched,2w348u,findanewpiercer,6,Mon Feb 16 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"Waiting 1 month between a stretch is pretty fast for a lot of people, and that's why 2 - 3 months is the usual time frame a lot of us go by.  I'm not sure what your goal size is, but say it's 0g/00g. With waiting 2 or 3 months for every stretch, that puts you at about 2 years roughly to get from an 18g piercing to 0gish. It's takes a lot of time and patience. Some people that are well into 2 inches or so for their lobes have been stretching for nearly 10 years for them to get to that point!   My ears are not stretchy at all either and I'm at 00g now. It's been about 4 years since I first started stretching and I downsized and let my lobes shrink up at one point during that period as well. It definitely is baby steps in the beginning for smaller sizes but it's well worth it once you get closer to your goal.   Have you looked at single flared color fronts by gorilla glass? They're not that expensive on bodyartforms.com, off the top of my head I believe an 8g pair was about $15, and I'm sure that smaller gauges around what you're at would be a bit cheaper too.   Oh and by the way, the way that you're stretching is awesome! Dead stretching is by far the best way to stretch and if you keep it up that way, your lobes are going to look amazing! Like I said, patience is key and I wouldn't think about it too much and stress yourself out over it. Just take your time and your lobes will really thank you for it."
Stretched,2w348u,agepfrich,3,Mon Feb 16 17:15:41 2015 UTC,"I know it will definitely be worth it. Whenever I see myself in my head, it's with stretched ears, and I want to make it real. I suppose it doesn't help hearing the people i know IRL talk about how they got to 00g in no time, and one who went from 18g to 10g in one go. It's upsetting that they can be so reckless and be at their goal with no issues, and I'm trying to do it right and having so many issues. I'm glad to hear from people like you who stuck it out and did it right. It makes me feel better about it."

A coworker of mine has just started stretching maybe 2 months ago and they're at 6g already and won't hear me out about care. I guess you just can't help everyone unfortunately.   I'd also like to say/admit that the reason it took me 4 years to finally get to 00g is because I tore my ear pretty bad at one point from getting impatient. I was at 0g and had been taping for maybe 2 weeks, then decided I'll just finish what ever is left with the taper but it was way too much for me. I decided to downsize completely after that to let my lobes heal.   So what could have taken me 2 years took literally twice the amount of time for doing something stupid on my part. Needless to say I learned my lesson after that!"

Either way you don't have time to wait for glass plugs. I know it sucks if they shrink up but I would be more worried about long term issues from having them swolen and in pain. I would remove immediately and do a sea salt soak several times a day till they are completely back to normal.

It is more likely that you attempted to stretch too quickly. Some people's ears are really stubborn, I know mine are. You're supposed to wait anywhere from 2-4 months (sometimes even more depending on the person) in between stretches. For future reference, if it hurts, stings or bleeds at all while stretching, you're going too quickly. Remember, you're stretching out your skin, and ear stretching is a process that requires lots of patience. I would size down for a while until your ear is fully healed. Do sea salt soaks several times daily (sea salt mixed with warm water) and keep them as clean as possible until healed."

Start with probably 2/3 layers, depending on how stretchy your ears are. I replace my tape every 2/3 days (more often if I get them wet in the shower) and I oil them once a day usually in the morning. You don't want to keep taking them out of your ears and fiddling with them because they get nasty pretty quickly.  I usually add a layer or 2 every week, not every time I re-tape the plugs."
Stretched,2w043w,BlackRainbow010301,2,Sun Feb 15 20:36:18 2015 UTC,It dries them out and is not recommended. There are literally no benefits to using it.  Edit: it's magnesium sulfate.

Stretched,2vz2um,LeannaBard,2,Sun Feb 15 15:01:08 2015 UTC,"Question 1:  Under normal circumstances you would not have to take any special care after downsizing because there is no stretch happening and there fore no tear to heal. But for you yes treat it like you just stretched it (because you did)  The most widely heard of time( that I have heard) frame to wait between stretches is anywhere from 2-5 months, if you want to do it 2000% correctly. Patience is the most important part of stretching. You can never stretch too slowly, only too fast.  And question #2: For me (infected super easily) a lot of things you Don't think about can cause infection such as,  Dirty pillowcases, Drying your ears off with a towel that you have already used on your body, not properly disinfected Ear phones( the ones that cover your ears), and  Even not properly washing your hair.  Also just a suggestion but you should invest in some vitamin e oil, or jojoba oil (ho-ho-ba) rub some on your ears at least once a day and massage your ears with them and within 2-3 months the stretch will be so easy you'll think you can skip sizes. ( but please Dont) haha  Any more questions I'll try my best to answer."
Stretched,2vz2um,Delucabazooka,1 point,Sun Feb 15 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This was incredibly helpful. I bet going too fast and my pillowcase are the biggest culprits. I have more trouble stretching than anyone I know, so I think I'm going to try and, not exactly dead stretch, but wait more like 2-3 months instead of one so the taper doesn't have to do much work. I already have Vitamin E oil so I'll keep using that."

Stretched,2vz2um,findanewpiercer,1 point,Sun Feb 15 19:54:19 2015 UTC,"If you tore your ear enough that it was bleeding, you need to wait at least until that's healed and longer. Probably 2-3 months honestly.   Also, stop using tapers."

Since you two have already established a common interest in stretching, it wouldn't be a crazy topic to bring up as an aside, like asking if she's ever considered wearing titanium (or, baby steps, stainless steel)--if she isn't interested in what you have to say then you should drop it and move on. Your chances are better if she asks you about your stretching journey first.  It's hard to bite your tongue when you are sure you know what's best and want to share it with the world.

She could always use acrylic but never have problems but there's still a much higher chance of problems with acrylic and wearing tapers than with wearing stainless steel, glass or titanium plugs. I've seen far more instances of messed up ears cause by wearing acrylics and far fewer of people who were wearing stainless steel. I'm not saying I'm an expert or anything just from what I've researched and seen, acrylic and tapers seems to be bad news, especially in fresh stretches."

Stretched,2vw9xm,findanewpiercer,2,Sun Feb 15 01:04:09 2015 UTC,"That's actually completely normal. It's sebum, and the farther you stretch the ear, the closer the sebaceous gland is stretched to the surface of the skin causing it to release sebum at higher rate. This happens to pretty much everyone who stretches their ears, but I would recommend cleaning it at least daily. I always clean my lobes & plugs when I take a shower at night.

Stretched,2vxfqo,findanewpiercer,0,Sun Feb 15 02:14:09 2015 UTC,"this is why i really frown upon doule flares at anything above 00g. Your ear is simply too small for that and really, double flares are more if youre permanently at a size (or staying there for a while) in my opinion anyway."
Stretched,2vxfqo,findanewpiercer,3,Sun Feb 15 04:52:48 2015 UTC,It has much less to do with double flares in general than it does to do with quality jewelry.   Cheap plugs usually have HUGE flares that can be sharp and much more difficult to remove / insert.
Stretched,2vxfqo,GoldenBacon,3,Sun Feb 15 09:54:54 2015 UTC,"I have not noticed this at all, in fact my gorilla glass plugs have the biggest flares in my collection."
Stretched,2vxfqo,loooooooooordjezuz,1 point,Sun Feb 15 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"Flare size should be relative to the plug size and material. Large glass will have larger flares because of the material weight, for example.   However, look at your plugs and look at the ones in the OP.  Yours will have a much more rounded flare with softer edges and a more gradual taper. The flare size also won't usually be 2-3 sizes larger than the plugs themselves also. This is the problem with a lot of economy level stone jewelry at smaller sizes that's just mass produced."

Stretched,2vubs4,BlackRainbow010301,4,Sat Feb 14 04:04:03 2015 UTC,Silicone is a no no in fresh stretches. Get it out of your ears and put some steel in. It can fuse to the repairing tissue and you'll have to get it removed by a doctor.

Stretched,2vt6np,smokeyfloats,3,Fri Feb 13 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"I'm using the BodFx stainless steel stretching kit. There are some people who are really anal about their ears and will insist on using nothing but glass and not going up a size any sooner than every 3 months. But I don't think that's really necessary. My steel can get a really faint smell if I don't clean my ears everyday (I just take them out and rub them off with a washcloth or paper towel or something before I shower and put them back in after the shower). But even if I go 2 or 3 days without doing that, I have to stick the tunnel right up to my nose to smell it.   I wouldn't use bone, wood, or any other organic stuff for the initial stretch because they do absorb water, which makes bacteria grow a lot easier and risks infection. Acrylic can give some people bad reactions. I haven't tried any yet, but if you try them and they don't bother your ears, I don't see any problem wearing them once in a while. I would just wait until your ears are fully healed after the stretch to put acrylics in. For the initial stretch, stainless steel or glass is probably the safest way to go. I'm not a pro or anything. I'm just going by the ton I've read and what little experience I have of my own."

Stretched,2vt3fv,perkachurr,5,Sat Feb 14 05:04:03 2015 UTC,"It actually took me three months to make it to 00. My ears were naturally a 12 gauge after wearing heavy earrings. I sized up within two to three weeks each. I was able to skip six gauge and go straight to four. I sized up to two and was there for two weeks. Then skipped zero and went to 00 quite easily. But then later found once my ears were sore that it was mis-sized and probably a one gauge. I stayed there until I felt my ears could handle that last stretch. It was barely even a stretch and my ear was never raw. I wore silicone the next day (This was before I knew it was a no-no)   I stayed at 00 for half a month and decide to size up to 1/2.  I've been at this size since late December.   My ears were really forgiving to me. I'm lucky. I'm much more educated now and do not plan to stretch any more until after highschool.   Edit: Don't see why I'm being downvoted. I told the truth, and yes I stretched stupidly. I had no guide and tried to figure it out. But whatever. My ears are fine and healthy.

Stretched,2vhnin,satan-says-meow,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:34:31 2015 UTC,"What's the type of ""stainless steel"" that you use? 316L?"

Stretched,2vhnin,Wo0d643,2,Thu Feb 26 20:14:57 2015 UTC,"My point is that acrylic is terrible as it emits toxins and it has fissures in it that harbor bacteria. ""Surgical steel"" is not formally defined. 316L is the minimum basic standard for steel to be at for body piercings, but it is usually externally threaded (tears at the piercing when the threads are passed through the hole) and it doesn't have a mirror polish to it which means it is ""rough"" and can again harbor bacteria. High quality steel is 316LVM ASTM F-138 which denotes implant grade. If your metal isn't implant grade 316LVM ASTM F-138 then you cannot say it is highest quality materials. Silver tarnishes the skin which leaves a black mark. The way to remove that black mark is to punch out that skin.   Glass is totally safe for the body and you can do lots of cool things with it. Stones are another good choice for healed piercings.   Just because you haven't had any direct issues with your materials doesn't mean you won't later down the road or that someone else won't. I just hope you're upfront properly tagging the materials you are using, like writing the metal grade."

I guess it worked out as I would have sold them in the end like the rest of my old collection, but I digress. lol.   I would LOVE a 1/2"" pair, now, to have forever. I only have my trans silver (they're super blemished, too, but I love them regardless.) and crystal blue as far as IS dichro goes.

Stretched,2vdegk,heyitsaubrey,2,Tue Feb 10 02:13:58 2015 UTC,"I stretched to a 2 a few days ago. The piercing had only shrunk to a 6 (from a 2/0) so this is only my 2nd stretch this time around. This ear is a little stubborn because of the scar tissue, so It's a few weeks behind my other. I tried 3 times to stretch it (when it stopped going in I immediately stopped and stayed at a 4) but it wasn't ready the first 2 times. It was a little tender for the first couple hours, but it didn't turn red or swell or anything. No real pain, just tenderness. Does it look like it's starting to blow out again? Or is it probably just the scar tissue from last time?"
Stretched,2vdegk,Eminetic,2,Tue Feb 10 02:21:24 2015 UTC,"After a blowout it will never be ""okay"" the damage is done but it looks like it may be able to continue stretching at a moderate pace"

Stretched,2vdegk,pizzaloser,1 point,Fri Feb 20 05:00:36 2015 UTC,"So it was at 6g and a 4g plug in with no force after a few weeks of wearing 6g jewelry? Then you tried to go to 2g piece and felt resistance and kept going or stopped on the 3rd time?   Personally, having forced too big plugs in and getting bloody ears, I'm stretching up again and only put the next size in when there is no resistance at all. My ears are not tender at all after a fresh stretch because they were already at that size when I put in the new jewelry."
Stretched,2ve56i,radialdesign,2,Tue Feb 10 06:21:50 2015 UTC,"Hello r/stretched, first time poster here. I have tiny and thin lobes but I would really like to have them stretched. On top of their absolute wimpiness, the piercings are also a little uneven (10 years old, with a gun). I had hopes to get to 2g, is that possible?  Bonus question: any tips for getting rid of scarring? I have two little dots where my ears were pierced a second time, they've been closed for at least 5 years but it feels like there are little hard bits of scar tissue under the skin. Advice is so appreciated!  Thanks all!"
Stretched,2ve56i,foxhilton,6,Tue Feb 10 06:25:04 2015 UTC,"2ga definitely looks possible. Just take your time...I think stretching should be regarded as a permanent modification, so you have literally your entire life to get to your goal size! If you stretch with glass colorfronts (like the ones glasswear studios/gorilla glass sell on bodyartforms.com) your ears will even be more prone to just self-stretch. Just listen to your body. Never force a stretch. If your ears aren't ready for a stretch, don't worry, they will be!  Also, for the scar tissue, oil massaging (jojoba or vitamin E oil are great!)will definitely help a little, but I can speak from experience: old fistulas from previous piercings, especially on your lobes... they never really close. At one point I had 5 on my left, and 7 on my right... now I have dot scars, which I think look kind of cool! Most of the holes are still open despite not having had jewelry inside them for several years, and I can still feel the hard fistulas in my lobes."

In addition, sea salt in general is considered outdated and it's production is considered dirty and contaminated (there's a reason doctors recommend a sterile saline solution, not a bag of salt from the grocery store) - See the first link again.  All that bullshit about ""trace minerals in sea salt helping the body heal"" is quackery.  With something like a saline soak, the benefit comes from heat, not from the saline or from the soak.  The entire point of having a saline solution in the first place is purely that it won't harm the piercing or the surrounding, not that it'll help the piercing.  The problem is you have people all over sites like Reddit who don't have first hand knowledge of the subject just parroting what they've heard before - and going into threads like this to say things like ""SOAK IT IN SEA SALT!"" when they have really no idea at all 1) what the problem is, and 2) what the accurate solution is.  Sea salt solutions, especially when mixed improperly (commonly too strong) or applied improperly (via q-tips, etc), are far more likely to damage a piercing further than to help it.  Have some people had success healing things with sea salt?  Absolutely, I'm certain they have.  However, science will show us that those piercings far more than likely healed in spite of the chemicals used on them, not because of them.    A proper aftercare regimen involving a sterile saline solution would involve using it as a rinse in a pressurized can, for the purpose of removing debris and dried discharge buildup on the outside of the piercing.  This is can be effective.  Troubleshooting a piercing is far, far more difficult than the internet makes it seem sometimes, and ""saline soak!"" is rarely the answer to the problem at hand - but someone's always quick to shout it out because they heard it once and think it's the greatest thing in the world. The only thing that is going to make your piercing heal is your body, and the only thing that's going to make it heal faster is to be healthy, stay hydrated, and to take a multivitamin.  Not salt.  In addition, most piercing problems have a solution that doesn't involve any sort of change in aftercare regimen at all. For example: common bumps on nostril piercings are almost always jewelry related or piercing placement related, yet when someone comes to /r/piercing with a nostril piercing that is relatively fresh, irritated, and with a cheap ill-fitting ring in it everyone cries ""Sea salt!  tea tree oil!  let an old lady kiss it!"" when the answer is actually ""Have it switched to a post-style piece of jewelry made from implant grade materials, and leave it alone"".   Wrong answers will hurt the piercing further.

It's important to leave your lobes alone during this process and use gloves when applying your salt soaks to help prevent contamination.

Stretched,2v9hhw,sirzack92,3,Mon Feb 9 03:37:43 2015 UTC,11/16 is the next size you should go to. 5/8 to 3/4 is a large stretch and going to 11/16 is pretty standard procedure now.
Stretched,2v9hhw,AbusiveAlbatross,1 point,Mon Feb 9 04:35:57 2015 UTC,Try it in mm sizes. You can find glass color fronts in mm sizes and are easy to dead stretch with.
Stretched,2v9hhw,IllicitIntentions,-2,Mon Feb 9 20:16:21 2015 UTC,"5/8 - 3/4 isn't a large stretch if you've given your ear enough time to heal. We're talking about a roughly 2mm size difference. If you've been at 5/8 for a while (6 months or more) some people are capable of a simple dead stretch to 3/4.   It's not very common for places to stock 17mm (11/16"") plugs, but I'm sure you could find a pair if you really wanted to. What was the problem with taping?"
Stretched,2v9hhw,PlugandStretch,3,Mon Feb 9 09:29:41 2015 UTC,"5/8 inch is 15.9mm and 3/4 inch is 19.1mm. That's a 3.2mm difference. I can tell you that going from 2 5/8 inches to 2 3/4 is still a significant jump, even though relatively, it's much less.  Going up 3.2mm all at once is basically going up 10mm in circumference. That's way too much to do all at once regardless of how long he's been sitting at 5/8inch.  Look for 11/16 inch (~17mm) plugs."

Stretched,2v9hhw,bigjimnm,2,Tue Feb 10 16:28:21 2015 UTC,I'm never able to get both sides equal or even perfectly smooth so I don't want to screw up my ear by having those bumps.
Stretched,2v9hhw,PlugandStretch,1 point,Mon Feb 9 12:23:12 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the bumps while you tape? unless the bump is outrageously sticking out and causing one spot of your ear to thin out more than the rest...it won't mess it up. It's like wearing teardrop plugs or other plugs that are not circular in shape.   but yeah, do a google search. I'm sure you can find 11/16"" somewhere online."
Stretched,2v8znt,CoknZambies,1 point,Mon Feb 9 00:59:19 2015 UTC,"A month or two like you said is a pretty good time to wait to try again. As always, listen to your body to really make sure it's ready to stretch again. I know how it feels to be so close to your goal size and you start to get impatient! I've definitely been there. I would also suggest maybe going back down to a 4g for a little while. Downsizing will help alleviate any swelling and your lobe will be less likely to form scar tissue from the tear because the surface area to heal will be smaller. Your lobe will also heal faster in general.  Also are you wearing tapers or plugs/tunnels? Tapers shouldn't be worn as jewelry if that's what you have in. They're just a stretching tool and then you follow through immediately with your jewelry. The tapers, especially being 2g(a bit more weight to them), will create uneven weight distribution in your lobe and they tend to keep your lobe in an unnatural position, like your lobes are turned up almost because the long part of the taper will hang down from gravity if that makes sense.   Using the tape method on a plug or tunnel will be a lot easier as well. I'm not quite sure how taping a taper would work honestly! Bodyartforms.com also sell 1g plugs in some styles if you're finding the stretch from 2g to 0g a bit difficult, so instead you're sizing up 1mm at a time rather than 2mm.  As for care, you can try sea salt soaks once or twice a day while your lobes heal up a bit. Take 1 cup of warm water and mix in 1/8 tsp (or I've seen some people suggest 1/4 tsp here) of sea salt and dip your lobe in the solution for about 5 minutes. The easiest way to submerge your lobe is tilting your head to the side while the cup is on a flat surface. It's pretty awkward but your lobes will feel so good afterwards! After maybe a week or two of soaking, you can use some jojoba oil or vitamin e oil to massage them daily. Massages will keep them moisturized and using vitamin e oil can help break up any scar tissue a bit over time."

I even know people who never bought any teardrops for years because they thought they actually need a ""teardrop"" stretched before wearing them.  The answer is simple tho; You don't need to stretch anything speical and they do not change the form of your lobe when you take them out. They do make it look bigger (well not exactly bigger overall, but the Y axis basically get's stretched further then the X one so it looks bigger) tho."

Stretched,2v91a8,ProductiveThings,2,Mon Feb 9 01:55:04 2015 UTC,"Sure! The larger stretching community generally recommends against using tapers and tape as well...  A single flare glass plug is absolutely the way to go! Waiting three months between stretches will give your skin time to regenerate collagen and heal well. The skin will also loosen around the plug and naturally stretch, making it possible to insert the next size without tapers or taping.  Now, don't get me wrong -- you'll still need some lubricant! But the plug should slip in without effort, if it doesn't then don't force it. Just wait a little longer.   Stretching isn't a fast process, and you shouldn't race to get to goal size or larger...  TL;DR - Dead stretching is simply inserting the next size. But you should read this^"

Stretched,2v91a8,forthewimd,1 point,Tue Feb 10 06:58:08 2015 UTC,"The best suggestion is to not stretch for at least 6 months after the initial piercing -- again this is a collagen thing and healing the skin well enough to be able to handle stretching...   I know you want to get to goal size and start stretching soon... But you only get one set of ears and lobes.  If you look At people with healthy lobes, and others with ears that they stretched too fast -- I think you'll start to understand why letting your ears take time is the best option...

Stretched,2v71bx,quack_quack_moo,8,Sun Feb 8 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, everyone here freaks out way too much about acrylic.   I agree COMPLETELY with acrylic being a huge nono is a fresh piercing/stretch. Wearing it for prolonged periods is also bad.   If you wear acrylic plugs in a completely healthy and healed stretch for a few hours, your ears will not fall off. If you find that you have a reaction, then it's best to avoid it.   No, acrylic is not the best jewelry and isn't safe to wear for a long time, but if your ears are completely healed and you pop some in for a few hours, you will likely be fine.   Stretching is one of those hobbies you should only take up if you're willing to go for quality. Keep glass/stone/titanium/etc as your main jewelry. Glass is just as cheap as acrylic if you get it online, so price is hardly a factor when it comes to quality products.   Paying an extra dollar or two for glass is surely easier than dealing with a reaction from extended acrylic wear."
Stretched,2v71bx,goldenjuicebox,5,Sun Feb 8 17:30:03 2015 UTC,"There are two reasons for the lack of approval over acrylic. The first being the maybe, which is the possibility of chemical seepage when the acrylic is around body temperature.  The most important is that acrylic is nowhere near as durable as steel or glass, and is covered in tiny imperfections and cracks that get worse over time. These cracks fill with any sebum that is present in your ear, and can cause infection.   I would not suggest the use of acrylic whatsoever, for the same reason that I don't externally threaded jewelry; I just don't want to risk it.  That being said, the risk is greatly reduced when the piercing is healed. The problem is, every person is different, and everyone is going to heal at a different rate. If I had to put a time frame on it, I'd say after around 4-6 weeks, you'd be good, but only you know if your ears or healed yet or not."
Stretched,2v71bx,SenSidethink,1 point,Sun Feb 8 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"but if your ears are completely healed and you pop some in for a few hours, you will likely be fine.   Actually, if the quality of the plug/tunnel isnt shit and your lobe is fully healed you can wear them for a week or two just fine. The main problem really is just the higher infection risk that you get when it's freshly stretched. If you don't have any problems with stone/horn, acrylic wont change that."

Stretched,2v0m98,MajestyZombie,2,Fri Feb 6 22:30:22 2015 UTC,"When getting to bigger sizes (for me it was around 3/4 inches), it's not really possible to sleep with nothing any longer. The earlobe will become pinched during sleep and could cause major problems.  What I've done is wear silicone tunnels (at my current size or smaller) to keep the holes open and prevent risks of getting pinched. Don't use the ""earskins"". Those are too flimsy and are unlikely to stay in all night.  I'm now at 2 5/8 inches (67mm) and still wear a pair of 2 inch silicone tunnels (I can't find any bigger that aren't earskins) every night. Yes, they do sometimes fall out, but I haven't had them get pinched too often during sleep."

Stretched,2uuqx3,taeebaybay,5,Thu Feb 5 08:22:13 2015 UTC,"The reason we shouldn't shower with wood plugs is because the moisture and humidity that water creates can damage the jewelry.  It may cause anything from discoloration to the wood potentially cracking from going to and from extreme degrees of high to low humidity.  These could potentially harm ears as well.  If you have ever seen a crack in a new piece of wood, humidity is usually the cause."

Stretched,2uuqx3,bovine-decollation,2,Thu Feb 5 09:31:45 2015 UTC,"I've just read that the wood is not supposed to be exposed to water at all, if possible. So my concern is that she showers with them in and then just leaves them there, doesn't dry them off or anything. I would assume that isn't ideal for the jewelry, wood exposed to water on a daily basis. I'm no expert but I would think that would be a great environment for bacterial growth. I'm in no way saying wood is bad, I just know it needs to be treated differently than other materials."
Stretched,2uuqx3,Loushea,2,Thu Feb 5 09:42:07 2015 UTC,"If wooden jewelry is made by a bigger company (UK custom plugs etc.) they usually cover it in a skin-friendly, varnish-like coating so there is some level of waterproofing. Honestly, I would suggest taking any type of plug out whilst showering just so your lobes aren't always under pressure."

Stretched,2us9il,jthmeffy,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:44:32 2015 UTC,Yep it can take up to a few months. My doctor said to just leave them out for a few weeks; there was really no rush to get the surgery done. I don't think there would have been a difference if I had waited a month or two.

Stretched,2uri52,Peculiar_Panda,2,Thu Feb 5 03:51:24 2015 UTC,"I don't find it very likely that you didn't wait long enough. Unless it was less than a week or your ears are very fussy, that is such a minuscule change in size that the initial stretch isn't likely to cause much problem. Maybe you laid on it while you were asleep in a way that tore the skin somehow? Regardless, if it were me, I probably wouldn't downsize because it's only .2 mm difference, but if you want to play it safe, go back to 16g. You don't want the hole to close up all the way if it might be infected, so at the very least keep a regular earring in."

Stretched,2uri52,HoboPanties,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:16:38 2015 UTC,"Well its definitely not a good thing. Were you wearing plugs? Did you use oil to stretch? Wait a long enough time? Was it a new material? Many things could do that.   Best thing would be to go back to 16, sea salt soaks ~3 times a day until swelling and excretions stop, then do massages to break up any scar tissue that may form. Good care at smaller sizes is important, otherwise stretching will be a pain forever."

Did a nice and slow stretch with a taper last night and despite the slight discomfort during the stretch, it feels great this morning."

Stretched,2ukgjt,rpgoof,1 point,Mon Feb 2 23:08:34 2015 UTC,"Steel but it happens with wood, silicone, Nd acrylic too."
Stretched,2ukgjt,st0lenglances,3,Mon Feb 2 23:11:59 2015 UTC,"You should try glass jewelry or implant grade titanium or steel.  I'm not sure what your jewelry is of course, but be a bit weary if it's ""stainless"" or ""surgical"" steel because those names don't really mean anything. Both are low quality metal, and low quality typically means more smell. Basically it's like Claires jewelry that is called ""sterling silver.""  Silicone, wood, and acrylic are all porous materials as well, which can harbor bacteria and absorb smell. Acrylic isn't really recommended to wear at all but silicone ( kaos brand only ) and wood are both fine in healed ears. You can clean silicone with just gentle hand soap but you cannot get wood completely wet. Take a damp cloth from time to time and wipe the jewelry down, let them dry completely, then oil them really nicely to clean them.  If you're cleaning your jewelry and ears every night I don't think that there is much else for you to do honestly besides try different jewelry. You're going to get some smell regardless because dead skin cells get trapped around the jewelry throughout the day/night and it's just natural, but I know it definitely gets annoying after a while! It's just one of those things that happens."
Stretched,2ukgjt,KrillinIsTheWorst,2,Tue Feb 3 20:12:53 2015 UTC,"Mine don't really smell unless I don't wash the plugs and my ears for a couple days. If I take a shower in the morning and don't wash them again the rest of the day they don't really smell the next morning.  But one time I was on a hiking trip and basically couldn't shower more than every 5-6 days (and this was Madagascar so we were sweating quite a bit). When we got to a place we could shower I walked into the bathroom and two of my friends were in there. I took my plugs out and one of them goes ""Ugh, what is that smell?!"" That was the only time I've ever had anyone else notice it and it was pretty bad that time."

Also I have found that doing oil rubs increase the chance for nasty ear funk. I do oil at night before bed, change my jewelry in the morning after washing them out and have no ear funk all day. No matter the material."
Stretched,2ukbfc,dj053ph,3,Mon Feb 2 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"I originally bought a acrylic set when I first started stretching as well. I didn't have any problems at first, but after stretching for about a year with it, my ears started getting really sensitive. I believe that I developed an allergy to it while I was using it which caused lots of redness, itching, slight swelling, etc. It was not pretty and it did not feel very good at all. That was maybe about 3 years ago, and I still cannot wear acrylic without having a reaction within a few hours. I can't even wear the black o - rings anymore, I need to wear the clear silicone ones!  If anything, I would replace the jewelry at least. Ideally you want glass, implant grade titanium, or implant grade steel. Glass will probably  be the cheapest out of those 3. Some people are also okay with using cheaper metals like stainless steel or surgical steel, but that would be your decision whether you want to try that or not.   Teflon/ptfe tape and bondage tape are used for the taping method (not to be confused with tapering or using tapers). You wrap 1 or 2 layers of tape around your jewelry every few days and it gradually stretches your lobe until you get to the next size up. This is a preferred method of stretching because it's so slow, compared to going up an entire size in one go with a taper.  Tapers are fine to use at smaller sizes, but the bigger you go, the bigger the size increments get between every size. 8g to 6g is the first full 1mm stretch, and 2g to 0g is the first full 2mm stretch, and every stretch after that is also 2mm.  Some people start using tape at 8g to 6g, but it's really recommended to at least use tape after 2g. A 2mm stretch for most people is way too much at one time and it can lead to tearing your lobe.   Depending on what your goal size is, you can also just wear heavy jewelry to stretch with as well. The weight will naturally stretch the lobe over time. Stone jewelry is usually recommended for this method. At small sizes this method won't make a huge difference because the jewelry is so small, but at larger sizes, like 1/2 in and over this is a good route to go.   As for general care, get some gentle antibacterial soap and also get some oils or butters/balms for lobe massages. You also want to use them as a lubricant when you size up if using tapers, or to keep the tape around your jewelry from drying out if you go that route.   I personally only use the soap for my jewelry, and I just rinse my lobes in the shower. When I use soap on my lobes they get a tight and dry feeling which I'm not a big fan of.   For oils you have a few options. Jojoba oil, vitamin e oil, bio oil, and emu oil are all good to use. Jojoba oil is known to be quite similar to skin's natural sebum. Vitamin e oil is very moisturizing and can break up scar tissue over time, but your body can become dependent on it over time. I personally have never used emu or bio oil though. You can also make your own mixture of oils, like 1/2 jojoba and 1/2 vitamin e. You take a few drops and massage it into your lobes once or twice a day and it keeps your lobes happy and healthy.   For balms, bodyartforms.com sells holey butter which is awesome. It's all natural and I find it keeps my lobes moisturized longer, especially now in winter, compared to oils. For me, I use my oils for massages and my holey butter before I go outside or out in general, because it's not as shiny as oils can be either.  I've seen in this sub that some people like using shea butter as well or other natural butters.  Hopefully this helped some!"
Stretched,2ukbfc,st0lenglances,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:10:20 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! Really appreciate your time!
Stretched,2ukbfc,rpgoof,2,Wed Feb 4 07:27:07 2015 UTC,"Acrylic isn't safe to stretch with - there is no way to sterilize it, and it is porous, meaning it can harbor bacteria and your healing skin can grow into the acrylic plugs. Some people are also very sensitive to acrylic and can't wear it even in healed piercings.  The safest materials to stretch with are steel, titanium, PTFE (Teflon, which they also make tape out of) and glass."
Stretched,2ukbfc,peachgin,2,Mon Feb 2 22:04:44 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I stretched with acrylic out of no education.  I did fine and made it to 1/2 that way, but I wouldn't recommend it. If you are allergic to acrylic and don't know, it will suck. Big time.   You should probably invest in steel tapers and plugs."
Stretched,2ukbfc,dbwoi,2,Mon Feb 2 23:15:52 2015 UTC,"You might be ok with acrylic; some people definitely are, but some are much more sensitive to less than ideal conditions. I'd avoid it to be on the safe side.  I started out with a kit, but soon realised that taper kits almost always skip sizes which can be really misleading. You shouldn't stretch more than 1mm at a time (which I definitely realised when finding that my kit went straight from 2mm to 4mm), maybe even less (that's where PTFE tape comes in, because even the next size up might be too much depending on your ears).  I found that buying jewellery a size at a time was really helpful to know how long it had been since my last stretch, because it's so easy to forget. I buy all mine online so I have the order confirmation emails."

Many people like bondage tape but I've had trouble working with it at 10mm and under. Thread seal tape is easier to work with on small plugs and to add to gradually imo. I'm not sure why you would tape tapers though unless you were wearing them as jewellery which you shouldn't be doing. Just tape your plugs man, you won't even need tapers."

It's actually a safer way to stretch because it's much more gradual and natural. You can take pretty much any size plug, I started taping at 8g for example, and wrap it in this stuff till it fits in your hole nice and tight but not uncomfortably, and then just add a wrap every few days or so until you get to the next size and those new plugs magically fit right in. Wait an appropriate amount of time for your ears to heal at each full gauge, and then go at it again till you hit your goal size."

Stretched,2tvicz,fruityloops17,4,Tue Jan 27 19:47:29 2015 UTC,Taping is definitely the safer route. I just use plumber tape (aka thread seal tape). I think some people use bondage tape and there may be one other type that people use but I can't remember. I just make sure to lube it up real well (I use jojoba oil or badger balm) because the tape will absorb it and if you don't use anything or don't use enough it can be hard to get them in/out.

Stretched,2tvicz,therest,2,Wed Jan 28 04:30:18 2015 UTC,"I bought mine at walmart, in the plumbing/hardware section. Cost about a buck fifty for two rolls, which will be far far more than you will likely ever need haha"
Stretched,2tvicz,st0lenglances,2,Wed Jan 28 09:32:19 2015 UTC,"Some people start the taping method at the 8g to 6g stretch because that is the first full 1 millimeter stretch and that's when some people start to find resistance using a taper.   But you most definitely want to start using tape at the 2g to 0g stretch and beyond that, at minimum. 2g to 0g and everything after that is a 2mm stretch at a time and most people cannot stretch that much at one time without some damage to their lobes.  The type of tape to use is up to you, between plumber's tape/ptfe tape and bondage tape like Krillen said. I've personally only used ptfe tape. It's a bit thinner than bondage tape which helps if your ears are a bit more stubborn (like mine). It's also the perfect width to begin with vs bondage tape that you need to cut length wise and width wise, but again it's all personal preference.   It's easiest to use a single flare plug and you just wrap 1 or 2 layers around every few days and use enough oil to make the tape turn transparent (if you're using ptfe otherwise just use a lot of oil for bondage) Make sure to replace all of the layers each time you add a new one, or else the tape gets gross very quickly and you risk trapping bacteria between every new layer. I also take mine out when I shower so that extra moisture doesn't get absorbed to them.  Edit: I also just remembered a point, never use any kind of tape with adhesive. Some people use electrical tape for some reason which is definitely not okay or recommended."

I'm an engineer, and that's what I've done when giving presentations, interviews, etc. But, my ears are way bigger than yours (I've been over an inch for 10 years) and they've never been an issue in my career.

Stretched,2tii7c,ZomNoms,6,Sat Jan 24 14:26:58 2015 UTC,"What I did, starting at 6:  Start with 2 layers, about 4 weeks after the last size (you may want more or less time). Use enough oil to turn the tape opaque (assuming you're using PTFE, which I recommend). Every other day, I would take them out after a shower, remove the old tape, clean my ears and plugs, then put them back with one more layer than before. For me, oil every other day was enough. Some people wrap over the old tape, but IMO that's grody. Massaging my ears with the plugs still in seemed to be enough, as putting them in more than once can bunch up the tape, which is a pain.  About 10 wraps of PTFE is 1mm. Good luck!"

Stretched,2tgawj,suite-dee,4,Fri Jan 23 22:25:21 2015 UTC,"She may be a good piercer (or she may not) but she is straight dumb in regards to stretching.  First, never never never ever skip sizes. They exist for a reason, especially 1g and 0.5g. I'm assuming your pain was just from skipping sizes. How long did you wait after piercing to start stretching?"
Stretched,2tgawj,JamesGoodall,2,Fri Jan 23 23:03:19 2015 UTC,"9 years from piercing. A few months between stretches each time. Same piercing shop, the owner and head piercer did all my stretches but one, the lady did the last one. I read some of the other stretching advice in this sub and why its a bad idea to skip sizes. At first I figured the piercing shop would be knowledgeable and that I could trust them, but now I realize I should have researched more. At least I'm done now with no tearing.  I didn't skip 6 to 4 or 8 to 6 and those hurt lots though. Are those big jumps in general?"
Stretched,2tgawj,LeannaBard,2,Fri Jan 23 23:57:00 2015 UTC,"That's when they start jumping an entire millimeter at a time. Before then you do fractions of a millimeter. The first is increased by .2, then by .4 then .6 and so on until you get to a 1mm jump from 8 to 6. A lot of people say they needed to wait longer for those, like 3 months instead of one, so that it didn't hurt."
Stretched,2tgawj,GoldenBacon,1 point,Sat Jan 24 00:09:56 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of 0.5g before, do you have to have them special made?"
Stretched,2tgawj,JamesGoodall,1 point,Sat Jan 24 05:56:32 2015 UTC,"It's just 9mm. Not special made, but it's not a common size for some stupid fucking reason."
Stretched,2tgawj,LeannaBard,2,Sat Jan 24 06:16:29 2015 UTC,"It hurts because you are letting someone else do it for you, and she can't tell when you're hurting and she needs to stop. And because she skipped sizes. It can sting a little on a stretch to the next size if you didn't wait long enough, but you're supposed to stop and wait longer. If you don't skip sizes and you wait a proper amount of time between each stretch, your tapers will slide in like butter and it shouldn't hurt at all. Somer people may have a little more difficulty than others, but actual pain just means you are tearing your skin and that is going to make scar tissue and make it even harder to stretch.   I would never let another person stretch my ears. I bought a kit that had tapers and tunnels from 14g all the way up to 00g, and I even had to buy a set of earrings that were 16g because my ears hurt trying to stretch from 18g to 14g. (It was probably cheaper than letting a piercer do it too I think the kit was less than $15 on Amazon.) That's only like .4 mm difference, but it hurt a lot. After I had stayed at 16g for a while, I was kind of scared to try for 14g, but it didn't hurt at all, and the tapers went right in. It left a little discomfort right when I slid it in, but that was all. My earlobes are thick too."
Stretched,2tgawj,LeannaBard,2,Fri Jan 23 23:51:28 2015 UTC,If I ever do the stretching thing again I am absolutely following your advice. I trusted a piercer because they are so good at piercing but I should have read this sub first! I had no idea!
Stretched,2tfwi6,Mattgdavis,3,Fri Jan 23 20:43:11 2015 UTC,Either put your 10g back in or nothing at all and wait a month or so till your lobe is healed. Sounds like you forced the jewelry in and maybe blew it out

Stretched,2tfwi6,LeannaBard,3,Fri Jan 23 21:27:39 2015 UTC,How long were at 10g? Did it hurt when you tapered up? Sounds like you ripped em open pretty bad by going way too fast.  Either way just take them out and let them heal and start over.

Stretched,2tavf3,AbusiveAlbatross,16,Thu Jan 22 16:39:07 2015 UTC,"I have a friend like this and while it might not be the most advisable thing to do, it's never hurt his ears (they are healthier than most peoples). He tried to stretch once every other month or so but by the end of month, his tunnels were falling out all the time so he decided to stretch up then and there, no pain, no bleeding, no cat butt, no blowout, no nothing. I'm sure the stretching Nazis will be all over this with their ""1mm per 3 months minimum"" bullshit but do whatever you want, if it goes badly, downsize and try again in a month or two."
Stretched,2tavf3,satan-says-meow,3,Thu Jan 22 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"This is how my ears are! I'm almost forced to stretch every 4 or 5 weeks because my tunnels won't stay in, and the flares will fit all the way through the fistula. Every time I've stretched it's been with a taper, and I've had to use ZERO effort to insert it."
Stretched,2tavf3,lukemese,2,Thu Jan 22 20:58:00 2015 UTC,"Towards reaching my goal size, I got like that too but I didn't use a taper, for the last two sizes I just dead stretched because my tunnels were so loose."

Stretched,2tavf3,pinkmagedon,5,Thu Feb 5 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"My ears stretched quick too, but waiting 6 weeks or whatever is for more than just healing after a stretch, it asks gives your ears tune to thicken up some before the next stretch. Are you sleeping naked? That may help them from getting so loose so quickly."
Stretched,2tavf3,JamesGoodall,5,Thu Jan 22 18:25:30 2015 UTC,"This is completely normal and indicates that your lobes are very healthy. For me, all of my stretches basically happened on their own: after a month or so at a given size, I could go up to the next size if I wanted. Otherwise, going without plugs for a while would allow them to tighten up.  I call this ""natural stretching"", and for some people it's fairly fast, while for others it's very slow. Regardless, it's the best way to stretch. It's how I've been able to reach 2 5/8 inches and still have thick, healthy earlobes. It's also how some people can reach enormous sizes like over 4 inches."
Stretched,2tavf3,bigjimnm,3,Thu Jan 22 20:10:43 2015 UTC,"Mine would skip sizes. Started at 12g because my holes had been there since I was 3 and they naturally stretched up to that. When i went to size up to 10, it slid right through. Couldnt even feel it. So I skipped it. Ears are doing fine. Now that im up to 0g, I got some nice tunnels that i dont mind keeping in for a few months, Im slowing it down. you know your body best, some people heal quicker than others."
Stretched,2tavf3,JessicaRahbbit,2,Thu Jan 22 17:17:34 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the point some people don't seem to get...  I've got some good advice on here, and some negative comments that I'm stretching too fast. I've gone from fresh pierce Dec 29th to 6g as of yesterday. I've never forced the next size in, never had irritation, etc. I don't see what the big deal is."
Stretched,2tavf3,PCnerd73,2,Mon Feb 23 01:53:50 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether or not it's ""okay,"" maybe try sleeping without your jewelry in to keep the skin taut.  In my opinion, I think that stretching that quickly is going to have consequences later, but either way, what's the harm in waiting? Stretching once a week can't be great for your wallet, and it just makes it harder to go back to smaller sizes if you decide to do so later.  My plugs would always fall out at night because they were too stretchy but I was at my goal size so I didn't want to keep going."

I don't have a tragus piercing but as far as I understand any cartilage piercings can take up to/more than a year to heal completely and you shouldn't be stretching before it's healed.

Stretched,2t3ji9,shufu,3,Tue Jan 20 23:03:12 2015 UTC,"The rule of stretching is; if it hurts, wait longer! Just give it more time to heal. Even with an earlobe piercing, which takes like 8 weeks to heal, it's recommended not to stretch for six months after it's healed. Just wait longer and don't irritate it or hurt yourself by trying to stretch when your body isn't ready."
Stretched,2t3ji9,420buttholesurfer420,1 point,Wed Jan 21 02:22:42 2015 UTC,"Wait wait and more wait.  Cartilage takes a long time to heal fully enough to be safely stretched, and even then it's not always easy for everybody.  Most people just get it pierced/punched at their goal size in the first place for that reason.    Every body is different but as a rule of thumb I wouldn't try to size up a cartilage piercing any sooner than 8-12 months.  Even then you might have trouble with it.  Also as always, consult your piercing artist.  Most of us who comment hear are very experienced, but not all of us are professionals (myself included).   If it's just a matter of really wanting to wear that jewelry I'd suggest trying to find it in a 16g.

I have also read about massaging with bio oil but I myself have never used it.  As you have already said, nothing will get rid of it 100% but doing regular massages helps break up the scar tissue a bit over some time.  Also are you wanting the hole to close to a smaller size rather than 8g? I let my 0g lobes shrink back down also after having them stretched for about 2 years and they never quite shrunk down completely. They looked to be about a 14g or 16gish piercing without jewelry in them, but I could fit about a 10g in them without stretching them.

Stretched,2strx3,sherises22,6,Sun Jan 18 12:49:26 2015 UTC,"Spirals probably aren't the best in an initial stretch, I stuck to tunnels. Also you should lube your ear up a bit before inserting the taper and use vit E oil every so often to keep your ear nice and supple. It's sounds like you may skipping sizes if you can't get the first taper through...you wanna start with 12g, sounds like you've skipped 2 sizes which is at least 2mm difference (I think) if you haven't stretched before. If you're using acrylic to stretch with, it's possible it will get stuck in your ear cos it's porous and generally shitty for a new stretch. In terms of maintenance, I don't clean them exactly besides rinsing in the shower, vit E oil and keep them healthy with quality materials. Hope that helps!"

Stretched,2snmqt,jadefirefly,6,Fri Jan 16 19:04:48 2015 UTC,Your drain almost certainly has a P-trap in it.

I love those, but they draw attention and weren't suitable for interviews.   By letting them downsize to 2g, I can wear the opalite plugs I have, which draw a lot less attention.

Stretched,2sltzj,bdevx,1 point,Fri Jan 16 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"Depends on your lobes really. I had extremely tiny lobes before I got pierced so I just did 16g and waited. The smaller your lobe the thinner the skin will be around the piercing, and if your lobe is small like mine a larger piercing can be bad because of how thin the skin will be when you start stretching. Just keep that in mind and talk with the piercer and everything should work out fine. Funny story time: I got my ears pierced at seperate times (a whole other story) when I got the second one done the woman doing the piercing came into the room and began getting her stuff together while engaging in some small talk and I told her I would like it lined up with me 0g ear as best she could. At this point she hadn't even looked at my ear (simple task no need I'm guessing). When she was ready she turned around with her marker to get it lined up and literally stopped in her tracks and said ""holy shit your ear lobe is tiny!"" We had a good laugh and she did the job. Gotta say she got it pretty damn perfect."

Stretched,2sltzj,bigjimnm,1 point,Mon Jan 19 17:12:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know what ""normal earrings"" you're referring to. If you're planning on getting them pierced with any type of piercing gun, please don't.  Any body piercing studio can pierce them at any size up to around 6g, depending on your anatomy. And you can start with several different types of jewelry, all better than the hideous ""starter studs"" you get with a gun piercing. 10g is a fine size to start. Even my septum was pierced at 10g and it was no big deal."

As far as waiting, most people will tell you 6 months or more, but I'd be lying if I said I waited that long. Everyone's body is different, so it's really quite difficult to say ""this is the perfect time."" For a size difference that small, I honestly doubt I'd wait six months, much less a year.

Stretched,2sgxpd,st0lenglances,3,Thu Jan 15 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"She's really going to mess her ears up. There is no doubt that she is going to tear them at some point and they are going to look horrible. You seem to be more educated than her on the subject already though. And I highly doubt she's going to listen to anyone's advice honestly and that's on her.   Every time she adds any trauma to her ears, she's going to create scar tissue. Scar tissue is a lot more difficult to stretch because it has a lot more resistance to it, and I'm willing to bet that if she continues stretching the way that she is, her lobes will not shrink back down, because of the scarring. They might shrink a little bit but i doubt they will shrink back to a normal looking piercing. If she's not going to take stretching seriously to begin with, chances are she'll want to downsize someday because she's tired of them and she'll be left with ugly, saggy ear lobes and at that point she won't be able to do much to fix them.

Stretched,2sgxpd,st0lenglances,5,Thu Jan 15 02:24:41 2015 UTC,"based on what i've read here, stretching up to about 0g should be done very gradually, using medical grade stainless steel, glass or titanium tapers and plugs. you lube up the taper a bit, push it through your ear then insert the plug right at the end. you never skip guages. you wait a certain time between stretches. when you're at like 0g the stretch to 00g is 2mm so you wanna start the taping method. you can read it all here and here"
Stretched,2sgxpd,peachgin,2,Thu Jan 15 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say you're completely right, but I'd add that everyone's ears behave differently (different ears on the same person can have their own requirements), so you may have to adjust slightly. Some people can stretch quicker, while some need to take it more slowly (at least 6 weeks is usually recommended). I think I started taping at 2g."
Stretched,2sgxpd,peachgin,3,Thu Jan 15 16:50:04 2015 UTC,"you're definitely right there, i appreciate the additions! also i think i made a mistake by saying to start taping at 0g because it's 2 to 0 with the bigger jump isn't it?"

Stretched,2sezu4,Bassookajoe,3,Wed Jan 14 17:01:03 2015 UTC,Don't use wood to stretch! Wood is porous and harbors bacteria. Use metal or glass. Nothing porous. Tapers are also not jewelry they are tools to stretch your ears. At 4g you could deadstretch (just naturally let your ears stretch) but you could also use the tape method (wrap bondage or ptfe tape around your jewelry. One wrap every few days). Or just get some metal or glass tapers and plugs. If you're going to 0g though don't taper that one its a huge 2mm jump.
Stretched,2sezu4,IllicitIntentions,1 point,Wed Jan 14 17:20:30 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Stretched,2sezu4,kevensentme,3,Wed Jan 14 19:07:04 2015 UTC,Surgical stainless steel is always best to stretch with. Also anyone on this sub will tell you Never wear tapers. Tapers are a tool to stretch and are not jewellery.  Another thing is organics are generally considered bad to stretch with/ wear in a fresh stretch. Organic jewelry is porous and harbours bacteria. They are not safe to stretch with. Do yourself a favour and get some stainless steel or glass tapers and some stainless steel plugs to put in after.

Your ear is angry at you, so it needs some time to itself.  I would recommend that you do daily or even twice daily earlobe massages with an essential oil of your choice (except tea tree oil) in order to help break down any scar tissue that may have formed and to help increase blood flow and tissue health.  If you don't know what oils to use, many people use vitamin E, emu, jojoba, etc. or products like Holey Butt'r, but you can also use household items like olive oil - the oil isn't as important as the actual massage itself.  Sea salt soaks (1/8 tsp of sea salt per cup of warm water, soak area for 3-5 minutes daily) will also help to soothe the lobe if there's any lasting pain and will help draw out bacteria in the case of an open wound.  Don't ever stretch with anything other than glass, high quality steel, or titanium. If you're on a budget, save up. It's not worth fucking up your ears permanently."

Stretched,2s4bel,madmiral,9,Mon Jan 12 01:50:07 2015 UTC,"6 months, no sooner. to be safe wait a full year"
Stretched,2s4bel,Eminetic,-4,Mon Jan 12 03:46:57 2015 UTC,theres no way i could stretch any sooner than that? how could it possibly take 6 months for my ears to heal fully? :(
Stretched,2s4bel,st0lenglances,9,Mon Jan 12 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"You really shouldn't to be on the safe side. You just created essentially a wound in your ear by piercing it and you need to wait for it to heal completely. Piercings generally heal from the outside in, so your ears may look or feel fine but still can be ""fresh"" for lack of a better term on the inside. You don't want to try and stretch a piercing that is still trying to heal itself, then on top of that try and heal the stretch basically. You don't want your ears to have any soreness, crusties, fresh lymph, any sign of a still healing piercing what so ever.  Stretching takes a lot of time and patience. After the 6 months for healing the initial piercings itself, the general rule is to wait 3 months between every stretch afterwards.   And for the other question, there really is no point of no return. It varies from person to person, how elastic their ears are to begin with, and how well they took care of their ears during the stretching process. If you go slow and do not stretch faster than you should, you generally should be fine. If you ever stretch too fast and tear your ear, you are going to be left with scar tissue, which is not very stretchy. The more scar tissue you have, the harder it will be to size up because of it's resistance, and lowers your chance of your lobes shrinking down for the same reason. Your best bet is to ensure you never need to worry about it by taking the best care of your ears possible."
Stretched,2s4bel,bdevx,5,Mon Jan 12 05:18:31 2015 UTC,"It's not just healing either. For a round to be ""healed"" it has to close up completely. For an ear lobe piercing this takes 3-6 weeks depending on your body. However the skin that has covered the wound is still very thin and fragil. The extra time everyone suggests is for that skin to thicken and strengthen because if you stretch the thin skin it is highly likely to tear open again (see blowout) and have to heal all over again. This thicker atronger skin is what we call ""fully healed"""
Stretched,2s4bel,radialdesign,3,Mon Jan 12 05:39:24 2015 UTC,"6 months is the minimum for a fresh piercing, but ever body is different. Your body could take longer or less to heal.. regardless, for a fresh piercing, wait as long as humanly possible. Even if it feels healed, it doesn't necessarily mean it is.... definitely not after a month.   As for your second question, I downsized from 1/2"" once completely and then restretched. After a couple months of not wearing plugs, my ears visually shrunk, (the hole basically turned into a small slit... not as noticeable, but definitely still looks like they were stretched.) but the smallest they would get was about 6ga. Remember, again, every body is different! There is no real ""set"" point of no return as far as stretching goes. That's why you should always consider stretching as a life-long thing, not just something for right now. Don't do it if you're already planning on downsizing."
Stretched,2s4bel,ilikeadabox,3,Mon Jan 12 16:32:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of people around here will tell you to wait 6 months, but personally I waited until mine stopped crusting, then waited a couple more weeks, then stretched (although I got pierced at 6G, might make a difference). You need the fistula to properly heal before stretching or you'll run the risk of blowouts. I've never tried closing but I'll say what someone will probably tell you. Everyone is different. A lot of people say 0-00G is the point of no return, but there have been people who have stretched larger and downsized much smaller. Listen to your body, it's the best indicator about these kinds of things."
Stretched,2s4bel,ilikeadabox,2,Mon Jan 12 02:32:53 2015 UTC,how long did you wait between sizes on average?

They do make some amazingly gorgeous stuff, though. The problem really is, it's not IS. And IS dichro is impossible to find nowadays... on LJ there was a community where we could buy/sell/trade plugs, and IS was always swapped between the close members. Unfortunately, it doesn't really exist anymore :(  Also, Bill from FrozenFire (on etsy) is officially done making glass. Dunno if he has any sort of popularity in here, but ""back in the day"" he was a god. His creations were the next-best-thing for those of us who preferred IS dichro. (and dichro was only some of what he made... he was a true artist!)  Also, it seems that Gorilla Glass has bought some of IS' old molds... I've seen a couple dichro pieces by them at a local shop that had the same designs as IS' old image dichro.  Here is the pair of IS trans silver I still have..  http://i105.photobucket.com/albums/m227/radialdesign/gaugetrade/in-ears/Untitled-4copy.jpg (This picture is from 2009. I don't have those wonky upper lobe piercings anymore.) Funny story with this particular pair, actually. I gave this pair to a close friend of mine who is at 1/2"" about 5 years ago, because I stretched up to 9/16"". Then, personal issues and shit happened, and I sold off my collection in 2011. I would have sold this pair with it. Fastforward to last year-- my friend and I were discussing our collections, and I lamented selling mine, as I had only one or two pairs at the time, and I'd never get my IS dichro back. She said that I deserved the pair I had given her back, and she was happy to give them to me. Sooo basically.. if I hadn't given her the plugs to begin with, I probably never would have seen them again. I'm so thankful.. they were always my favorite pair, and they do go with everything. :)"

It sounds like your ear is swelling. Find a different piercer to help you, or see a doctor to have it removed. Then start from scratch, do sea salt soaks, use jojoba oil and do massages to your lobes, and most importantly, go slowly. Also make sure to only wear glass or steel in a fresh stretch, so as to avoid getting an infection from porous material.  I hope this helps you, good luck getting that tunnel out!"

Stretching is always to be considered a lifelong process, and if you have any doubts considering your career, I would not pursue it again. Just some food for thought. I can't imagine there would be any issues with stretching, provided you go to a reputable piercer to repierce your lobes, and take your time. (Again, if it's something you're going to have for the rest of your life... why rush, right?)  eta: Like the other commenter said, scar tissue could get in the way.

I have a beautiful pair of bloodstone plugs (http://i.imgur.com/kGpo1dn.jpg) that I wear, and they are very heavy (and they are concave), but don't hurt to wear at all, but if I do anything active, they flop around hard against my neck. Also, by the end of the day, they stretch my lobe out enough that they almost fall out. So I can't wear them every day, and typically wear them for special occasions.  So, the point is: you can't really wear heavy stone plugs every day once you stretch huge (>2 inches)."

So it's a little bigger of a size change than you've been making before. You may just need to wait a little longer. Once the cranky ear feels better, try playing with it when you're sitting around, like watching TV - gently, of course. You can lightly stretch on it, and that can help. Especially if you're using oil and massaging often."
Stretched,2roha4,jadefirefly,4,Wed Jan 7 23:17:45 2015 UTC,"Lots of patience and tugging on your earlobe, with your jewelry in, to naturally stretch the ear.  Stretching up to an 8 is easy.  Going to a 6 is your first big jump."
Stretched,2roha4,Dina_Belcher,3,Thu Jan 8 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"That's where I had to start using the taping method- adding a wrap of PTFE tape (well lubed- Teflon tape is absorbent and will otherwise dry out your lobes) around your 8g plug every couple days. At about 10 wraps, the 6g should go in."
Stretched,2roha4,K_rey,2,Thu Jan 8 02:42:08 2015 UTC,This is what I did too and I found it was the best method once I started getting past 8g. Happily at 4g until the bug bites me again

I'm at an 8g now and didn't even want to mess with the full jump to 6g, because even 12 to 10 and 10 to 8 gave me fits. So, I ordered a pair of 7g glass off Bodyartforms.

I'll give it a little longer and keep doing massages, and if nothing changes over time, I'll try the taping method.

Also, head over to Menards or Home Depot (or any hardware store) and pick up a roll of PTFE tape. It's a good $1 or so and IIRC, it's a bit thinner than bondage tape so it's easier to stretch with. Also, the emu oil or vitamin e oil should help more than jojoba for stretching since they're a bit slicker than jojoba. Just remember to completely saturate the PTFE before you wear it or it'll dry out your ears.   My ears aren't very stretchy either. Just gotta go slow and spoil them."

I don't know what position you sleep in but if you're a side sleeper switch up materials at night once you heal to see if that's the issue. If not, it may be your plugs. Like K_Rey said, in the future avoid alcohol and use something less harsh on your lobes; like sea salt. Make sure you properly sanitize your plugs, do jojoba oil rubs once you heal as a normal upkeep on your ears etc (I'm sure you know all this stuff, but just a reminder).

While it's possible you have naturally very elastic lobes, it would likely be easier and healthier for you to find in between sizes. I believe some companies such as Gorilla Glass or Glassware Studios should make glass plugs in 1 mm increments in that size."

Stretched,2rjbsi,alizarincrimson7,2,Tue Jan 6 18:26:46 2015 UTC,I used the tape method and use mm sizes instead of fractions of inches. Sometimes I'd get lazy about taping and just wear my glass color fronts and after a few months they'd be ready for the next size.

Stretched,2rjbsi,blackhole-san,2,Tue Jan 6 20:38:54 2015 UTC,"I taped up from 5/8 to 3/4.  It was my most seamless stretch by far. Take your 5/8 plugs and then go buy some bondage tape. Add a layer or two every few days, make sure to keep em clean (everyday) and after a weeks worth of taping, measure out how many little strips you added and make that into on long strip. Keep taping up til your slightly bigger than 3/4."
Stretched,2rjbsi,blackhole-san,1 point,Tue Jan 6 20:50:31 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about using tape for my stretches from now on. How soon do you think it is safe to begin taping?

Stretched,2rjbsi,nightwangg,1 point,Tue Jan 6 21:57:05 2015 UTC,"after a stretch, I'd wait minimum 2months. When I tried to go faster in the past, it didn't go as smoothly. Not that it was bad, sure it worked. But I like just letting my plugs chill in my ears until they fall ouf after becoming loose on their own. When I started wearing mostly glass/silicone was when I had to start taping.  Now, I have found a size I'm happy with and sometimes I go back down to 3/4 just let my ears fatten up a bit, then I go back up, but usually my 7/8 plugs just go right back in."

Stretched,2rhn1f,wallflower_28,9,Tue Jan 6 06:23:06 2015 UTC,"It's okay for it to be a bit pink on the inside, especially after a fresh stretch. You're on the right track though! Stick with quality jewelry, and you're doing the right thing with massages. Also, you might be able to size up in a month, but if your ears start saying no halfway down the taper, it's okay to wait. Some people have no problem getting through small sizes and others take a while to size up from the start.   Also, be prepared for a bit of frustration, and don't be like me and try to calculate when you'll be at your goal size. You'll be disappointed due to time between stretches increasing with size. It took me 4 months to go from 8g to 6g and I eventually got frustrated and taped up. It's the first full mm stretch, so it's a bit of a fight. Whenever you feel ready to just shove the taper through or add one more layer of tape than usual, look at some of the posts by people who've blown out and you'll want to wait. There's people here with 2"" ears. Your goal size is possible. They didn't get there over night, or even in a couple months.   It's a bit early so I rambled a bit, but stick with generally accepted methods, good jewelry, and don't rush at all. You're asking early, so you're getting a head start on healthy lobes!"

Stretched,2rhn1f,goldenjuicebox,2,Thu Jan 15 07:00:07 2015 UTC,"Generally, keep oils out of a fresh stretch for a week or so until it's healed. I find it best to do massages with the jewelry out so it gets into the piercing and the piercing has time to relax.   For cleaning, when the stretch is fresh, it's okay to do a soak with the jewelry in, just like its a fresh piercing. If the stretch is all healed up then you can take the jewelry out for sea salt soaks."
Stretched,2rhn1f,LeannaBard,2,Thu Jan 15 12:22:57 2015 UTC,"I just went from 18 to 16 a little more than two weeks ago. Mine are pinkish inside too. I feel like my ears are totally healed, but it still takes a little time to get the plugs in. Like, once they get in my ear, I have to guide it out the back hole. It won't just go through easily. It doesn't hurt, but I have to use my fingers to kind of stretch the hole open so the skin slides all the way down the plug instead of staying stretched out over the length of the plug. I'm going to wait another couple weeks before going to 14g just to be safe. I massage with Vit E oil every day and I think it has helped.  Do you have any resistance putting your jewelry back in after cleaning, like the back not wanting to open up without your help?"

Stretched,2rhn1f,LeannaBard,1 point,Wed Jan 7 05:15:47 2015 UTC,Your ears are most likely not anywhere near healed two weeks after stretching. I've always been told to treat a fresh stretch like a new piercing as far as how healed it is.

I just pushed them in slowly, and there wasn't too much resistance. They were a little sore the next day, but that was it."
Stretched,2rhn1f,LeannaBard,1 point,Wed Jan 7 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"That's generally how you should stretch, is just a dead stretch with no taper. Tapers aren't really ideal and can put uneven pressure on your lobes. It shouldn't really be sore, soreness is not a good sign."
Stretched,2rhn1f,miss_beredo,1 point,Wed Jan 7 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Everyone I've heard from said a little soreness is normal. I cant reaaly imagine stretcing not causing a little discomfort. But, wouldn't dead stretching wreck your ears once you start going up by full mm?"
Stretched,2rhn1f,blalokjpg,1 point,Wed Jan 7 16:37:23 2015 UTC,"Nope. That's how I've always stretched and it's perfect every time. You buy single flair glass plugs (but don't skip any sizes, go from a 16 to a 15, 15 to 14, etc.) and wait longer periods between stretches. Your ears naturally stretch over time (old ladies who've had their ears pierced for 60 years probably have 14s or 12s and don't even know it, especially if they wear a lot of dangly earrings). For me that's usually 2-3 months between sizes. Massages in between and such are always a good idea. When my plugs start gapping I take them out in the shower, and slip the next size up in my ears with a little oil. Absolutely no pain at all, and they slide in like butter."
Stretched,2rezrw,HipsterWho,10,Mon Jan 5 17:11:18 2015 UTC,"first: silicone should not be used that quickly after a stretch. 4 week minimum, or you're risking your ears fusing to it. I've had it happen to me. I know many others that it has happened to as well. Silicone is porous. Take it out immediately.  second: your ears are likely frostbitten if they weren't adequately covered. They need a lot of TLC. Warm showers, vitamin e oil rubs. Don't bother doing any of the soaks, they won't do you any good unless your ears have actual open wounds on them. The shower will create the same irrigating, warmth, cleanliness that a soak would.  third: what brand of silicone? There's only one safe brand: Kaos. Kaos is the only implant grade brand. No others should be used. It says right on the package to not use it for stretching."

Stretched,2rezrw,Azusanga,3,Mon Jan 5 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Uh yes, definitely! You really shouldn't be wearing silicone all the time, it's not a very safe material. But, in weather that cold, you should be wearing wood!   Id get rid of the silicone asap, do daily sea salt soaks, use a little vitamin e oil, and wear glass plugs until your ears are healed up, then switch to wood."
Stretched,2rezrw,therest,1 point,Mon Jan 5 17:49:02 2015 UTC,Silicone is perfectly safe on healed ears if they're Kaos brand. No other brands of Silicone are safe though.

Stretched,2r68nn,JaysOnReddiit,2,Sat Jan 3 11:14:24 2015 UTC,"I second this. Listen to your lobes! If you feel pain when stretching, don't do it. I don't know how big you plan on going, but also look into the taping method. I learned that it is also a safe way to stretch if done properly. I'm at 5/8 after two years and I suffered my first blow out when I made the stretch to 5/8. I might even downsize, but my ears are too tender right now to take the plugs out to downsize. I only waited about 6 weeks so it's best to just take it slow. Some stretches might be ready to stretch faster than others, but 3 months is a good estimate for your ears to be ready. I don't plan on making any stretches for about 4 months because of my last experience."
Stretched,2r68nn,CatsandPotatoes,8,Sun Jan 4 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"Is that o rings on the tapers? Just remember not to wear tapers, I'm not sure what else the o rings would be used for."

Stretched,2r68nn,IllicitIntentions,3,Sat Jan 3 06:46:11 2015 UTC,Past a 2g you really should not use tapers. Tape method or dead stretching is way better for your ears and less likely to blow out or rip. Honestly those tapers look kinda bad the length of the actual taper part is way too short and I don't see any plugs/tunnels. Tapers are not jewelry even at smaller sizes.
Stretched,2r68nn,blalokjpg,1 point,Sun Jan 4 03:14:53 2015 UTC,"I think for when you goto clean the plug ? When I got the kit, the tapers came with o-rings as well. I know you aren't supposed to wear tapers as jewelry but I think it doesn't really affect your ears at such as small size (16g-12g) because it's not as heavy. However around 8g-4g, the tapers became heavier and I would need the o-ring to hold the taper from sliding all the way through my ear when I would clean the tunnel/ plug. But what /u/khitsule said is correct, tapers aren't supposed to be worn as jewelry."
Stretched,2r68nn,bigjimnm,4,Sat Jan 3 22:06:01 2015 UTC,"I wish those kits existed back when I started stretching (in 1999)! Just don't be tempted to go too fast. I stretched up a gauge size (14g to 12g for example) about every month and now have healthy 67mm ears (2 5/8 inches) today.  Everybody is unique: there is no one set rate to stretch up. There should never be a sharp pain (only mild discomfort), and certainly NEVER blood involved.  Best of luck!"

Stretched,2r5pu2,CatsandPotatoes,3,Sat Jan 3 01:14:41 2015 UTC,At bigger sizes I've always read its better to tape to the next size or wait til your lobes are healed to where the jewelry starts to fall out and then stretch up. I wouldn't have taken the plugs out so soon though either.  I recently thought I messed up the inside of my lobe and just did sea salt soaks and whatever it was cleared itself up in a few days. And my ears are all healthy.  You're just going to have to downsize for a while til it heals then began the stretching again. I'd recommend taping this time.
Stretched,2r5pu2,distraction12,1 point,Sat Jan 3 01:52:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I've been doing sea salt soaks but I haven't seen much progress yet.

Stretched,2r5pu2,distraction12,1 point,Sat Jan 3 02:27:18 2015 UTC,Mine were tender and swollen too. I was doing 3 soaks a day. But if it's making you want to see the doctor to be sure I would recommend you go then.  Btw when did you get stretched by the piercer and how long ago did you stretch to the previous size?
Stretched,2r5pu2,distraction12,2,Sat Jan 3 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"It's been about 6 days. I started doing soaks 2 days ago because I didn't notice how bad they were. And my last stretch was around 6 weeks ago. My last stretch went so well that I think I got a little cocky and stretched too soon. The last time I stretched up, my typical piercer wasn't in and I got stretched with a taper by the other piercer who works there. The taper went right through with no pressure so I thought I could handle a new stretch in 6 weeks. I've read online that bigger sizes shouldn't stretch as fast so I take blame for being impatient. I thought it was okay because my typical piercer said 6 weeks was enough."
Stretched,2r5pu2,Romeo_horse_cock,1 point,Sat Jan 3 03:02:51 2015 UTC,Yeah that's too fast. 6 weeks is the minimum for the lobe to heal. When its ready your ear will tell you. If you don't have an infection I would continue to do the salt soaks but don't take out your plugs. Good luck

Stretched,2qyhj5,bigjimnm,3,Wed Dec 31 22:31:52 2014 UTC,"I think it's definitely just personal opinion for this one. Personally it would bug the hell out of me to have one ear even one size different than the other, just because I can't stand for things no to be symetrical. Also, I tend to not like any stretch so big that your lobes start turning out sideways and it's bigger than the top half of your ear. I imagine I would find the combination of a hole bigger than the original lobe only on one side even more unappealing.

I never owned any plugs from Diablo in 00g, however, I did gift my friend a couple of pairs of Oracle stone plugs in 00g. Her ears were at 10mm, but the Oracle plugs had a wearable of 9mm, so they caused her ears to shrink, and she had difficulty putting back in her other plugs. She'd been at 10mm at the time for almost two years and wore solely double flare, so eventually she just stopped wearing the Oracle plugs.  I don't know what Diablo's wearable size is in millimeters at 00g, but I can't say I'd recommend Oracle if you're not at 9mm and/or you don't have super stretchy ears to go back and forth between 9 and 10mm. They make wonderful quality stuff though. The flares on the plugs I got my friend were very smooth, and the stones all had a nice cut to them.  I've had several plugs from Diablo at 0g and 1/2"". My 0g plugs had a flare of 9mm and my 1/2"" generally has a flare between 14 and 15mm. Their flares aren't too bad. I think at 00g, they may have one side flat and the other face is round."

All that's to say - if you're newly at a size or you have tighter ears, Diablo might be good for you because small flares and tend to run small in general.

Stretched,2qnu40,bejahu,5,Mon Dec 29 00:17:25 2014 UTC,I have the same pair (and size) and I love Kaos. You should wait a while to wear them though like the other people said.
Stretched,2qnu40,Ewrong,8,Mon Dec 29 02:27:43 2014 UTC,You shouldn't be wearing silicone so soon after a stretch. That can cause some damage.
Stretched,2qnu40,LeeHarveyT-Bag,-9,Mon Dec 29 00:55:41 2014 UTC,"I've never had problems before, and I don't constantly wear them, I've been switching between all my acrylic(people say what they want about acrylic, but it has no negative effects on my ears), steel, silicone, stone and glass plugs. Don't worry I know my body and what it can handle."
Stretched,2qnu40,Ewrong,4,Mon Dec 29 01:06:45 2014 UTC,"I'm not an acrylic nazi as some people around here, BUT I think you are changing your plugs too much too soon. If you just stretched two weeks ago, pick a (safe) material and stick with it for a bit. Your stretch is still pretty fresh, leaving your lobes more prone to be irritated."
Stretched,2qnu40,SNOne,-8,Mon Dec 29 01:13:27 2014 UTC,It's been close to three weeks or more.
Stretched,2qnu40,Ewrong,5,Mon Dec 29 01:17:26 2014 UTC,Just because you've never had problems before doesn't mean you won't now. And just because you can't see the negative effects of acrylic  doesn't mean they aren't there. Acrylic leaks toxins into your skin and weakens and thins the skin.
Stretched,2qnu40,SNOne,1 point,Mon Dec 29 01:09:40 2014 UTC,Could you please cite done source on the acrylic leaking toxins into your skin. I'm a chemist and I find this very hard to believe.
Stretched,2qnu40,Ewrong,0,Mon Dec 29 05:45:18 2014 UTC,Sure.
Stretched,2qnu40,SNOne,3,Mon Dec 29 06:08:43 2014 UTC,"Typing in dangers of acrylic into Google is not citing a source.  EDIT: I wasn't saying some people have issues with acrylic plugs, i myself have had issues with acrylic plugs but I did some research and they don't leak toxins into the skin. It's not that you're giving bad advice to this person because wearing steel or glass in fresh stretches is probably better but if this person isn't having any issues with the plugs I'd say go for it.   It wasn't like she was asking for any advice on her blown out stretches because she stretched from 2mm to 20 in a week with acrylic expanders.   I'm not trying to be a dick about it but I don't like the circlejerk going on around the body mods subs with regards to the one way to treat every piercing on everyone. If it works for a person great if it doesn't they can try something else."
Stretched,2qnu40,Ewrong,2,Mon Dec 29 07:31:52 2014 UTC,"Second link and it's been posted in pretty much every post on that google page, which is why I just linked the whole page. Not only does it release toxins into the skin (Even the ""Chemically safe"" acrylics still leak a small amount of toxins, just less that what is approved) but it's also impossible to sterilize it because heat sterilization melts it and chemical sterilization breaks down the material."

Stretched,2qoi9b,Eminetics,3,Mon Dec 29 04:56:36 2014 UTC,"We already told you it was a blowout a couple weeks ago :( :(  Keep them naked, do daily massages, then after a LONG time (months...six at LEAST) start stretching up again, but take your time so you don't have this problem again. Only wear double flared jewelry when your ears are fully healed."

Stretched,2qoi9b,Eminetics,-1,Mon Dec 29 08:32:31 2014 UTC,I've read and heard from my piecer that the 6 month naked thing is bogus. Downsize one or two and take special care. Any literature proving otherwise?
Stretched,2qoi9b,sabriel_s,5,Mon Dec 29 08:43:57 2014 UTC,"If you are at least 1/2, sleep with your jewelry out at night. It gives the ear time to relax and increases the circulation and makes it just all warm and happy. In the morning if you ears are a bit tight just put in some smaller plugs for like 20 mins to loosen them up and the other jewelry will slide in easier. Do daily oil massages with jojoba oil, vitamin e oil, or if you really have to olive oil 2 or 3 times a day is the best. I would say once in the morning when you go to put your plugs back in and once at night when you take them out, however oil is not a magic elixir its not going to cure your thin or blown out lobes over night! its simply a method of making your ears happier and increases the blood flow to the area to promote new cell growth which in turn can help build new tissue BUT IT TAKES TIMEEEEEEE Down size. Yes I said down size. The best thing I have found to get my ears thick is to constantly down size and re stretch over and over, the idea is when you stretch you make more collagen, so if you shrink and stretch again properly you are building up even more collagen which bulks up the tissue.   That’s it…yeah I know it’s not that magical is it. the main thing that really keeps your ears healthy and thick is just doing it right and loving them and babying them I mean you don’t have to go overboard with it, but wash them regularly don’t hurt them give them nice jewelry etc, the small things really do count  IMPORTANT, if you get a blow out, tear, have pain or bleeding, take your jewelry out immediately don’t wait it out, put in different jewelry  This is not a race this is your body…your ears….you are with them for life, so treat them right if they are fucked you need to take care of them immediately  If you are stretching and its hurts a lot YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG, if you are stretching and it bleeds YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG, never force a stretch if your ear isn’t ready give it another week and try again  Don’t be cheap with your ears. Don’t just cram bullshit stuff in your ear around the house. If you don’t have the money to buy real jewelry then wait save and get the good stuff. You get what you put into something. If you get good jewelry then your ears will benefit from it and so will you. There is a lot of shit jewelry out there that will hurt you more than help you.  When stretching I say to stay away from wood, bone, silicone and acrylic, healed holes not so bad but never fresh. I dealt with silicone already but let me jump in a little on acrylic and organics in fresh piercings. The problem with acrylic is that well its acrylic ha-ha. Your body is not really meant to have that in it. It’s not hypoallergenic and can cause some really bad reactions i.e. allergic and otherwise. Your body at times can see acrylic as a foreign substance and try to break down the other layer of it and release it into your blood stream…..so yeah not good ha-ha  Organics are not bad at all. I love stone and wood etc, but when it comes to stretching they can be a big no no. stone if its dense enough can be fine, but there are a lot of porous stones out there so watch out. This leads me into wood. I love wood with a passion it is all I really wear in my ears, but it can be dangerous to stretch with. If you were to get micro tears in your lobes from an iffy stretch the plasma your body creates to heal can get absorbed into the wood and start to rot and release some not so nice bacterium that can give infections which smells and is gross and can potentially kill you. All can also be said for horn and bone. To porous for fresh body contact for sure.  There you go."

Stretched,2qoi9b,Eminetics,2,Mon Dec 29 06:00:03 2014 UTC,"Blowout in progress. Remove jewelry, do not put it back in. Leave it naked for 6 months, let it close as much as it wants. Daily massages with vitamin e, jojoba, coconut, or emu oil (holey butt'r is suitable as well). Pray to your deity (if applicable) that you caught it in time.  After the six months: Stretch slowly, listen to your body, use only implant grade material, continue to do daily massages."

Jewelry that isn't either circular or teardrop shaped will cause serious damage to earlobes in an alarmingly short amount of time, and from the redness if your lobe, the damage is already starting. Look for the guy who posted his red square eyelets at 5/8ths on here, he has a follow up of how his ears got fucking demolished shortly after posting. And another word of advice.

Stretched,2qmwlo,CatsandPotatoes,4,Sun Dec 28 20:38:03 2014 UTC,"Really low quality silicone, similar to wearing metal eyelets from HT or Spencer's which is essentially scrap metal, a little more risky since silicone requires a coating on the outside that non Kaos silicone usually doesn't use. Same would go for HT and Spencer's organics, since wood plugs usually have a coating on them as well, which would either be non present or really low quality if bought at one of these places."
Stretched,2qmwlo,TreyN7,3,Sun Dec 28 21:57:05 2014 UTC,Silicone is naturally jagged/barbed like a fish hook and Kaos has a patented coating on it that negates the bards. And since it's patented it's the only one that has this coating. Other silicone jewelery can tear up your ears.    Quick note. Kaos shouldn't be worn for more than a few years. Especially if you leave them in when showering/swimming.

Stretched,2qd4wm,TehGodfather,5,Thu Dec 25 14:22:16 2014 UTC,"Probably not bigger than a 00g which is roughly 10mm. 6 months or more for them to really heal.  Inbetween stretches 1 - 3 months minimun depending on the person. Glass is the best option in my opinion.  Autoclaveable, inbetween sizes, hypoallergenic, etc . . .  Titainium, 316LVM ASTM F138 stainless steel, and gold are also fine to stretch with. I suggest going to your piercing shop, app certified recommended but that doesn't always mean they are good piercers, and having them help to get the jewelry in or to use a quality steel taper.  Tapers aren't jewelry they are used to stretch the ear briefly to get the next size of jewelry in.  Ask your piercer what they recommend. Pictures of your ears at a minimum would be necessary to give you any sort of idea.  Really you should ask your piercer. Depends if you follow good practices, but like I said ask your piercer."

Stretched,2qd4wm,Kammender_Kewl,1 point,Thu Dec 25 19:26:51 2014 UTC,Correct on the tapers.  I assumed since he wanted to stay small it wasn't necessary to mention taping after 0g/00g.  Certainly something to take note of though thanks for the addition!
Stretched,2qd4wm,jbrown5217,1 point,Thu Dec 25 19:39:09 2014 UTC,"/u/jbrown5217 said it right. In addition, make sure you get your ears pierced by needle, not with a piercing gun. Some piercers will initially pierce at up to 8g if you ask. I used a bodfx titanium stretching kit I found on Amazon for about $20. No I'll effects, although I switched to the taping method and glass plugs at 6g.  Im still glad I got the kit even though I stopped using the tapers, because I like the tunnels it came with.  My lobes are attached (which is what I assume you mean by 'don't have any') and I'm debating stopping at 2g, where I am now, even though 00 was my initial goal. My lobes aren't noticeably thinner than when I began.  Using jojoba/emu/vitamin E oil is very important for stretching and for keeping your lobes healthy and not chapped.  No part of stretching your ears should hurt, like, at all. So immediately stop if it does and put the last size back in.  Bodyartforms.com is a great resource for buying jewelry, and their messageboard has tons of good beginner info. Good luck with your  lobes, and don't rush anything!"

Stretched,2qb8qp,worthlesspancakes,4,Wed Dec 24 21:26:16 2014 UTC,"Hmm...flare type is strongly dependent upon the wearer. Have you ever seen ""o-rings"" on your friend's jewelry? They are black or clear round rubber band-looking things. They can be seen on the front or the backs of jewelry. If you've seen them, I'd go with SINGLE FLARE. If you've noticed no rubber band looking things, I'd probably go with DOUBLE FLARE. The screw type are pretty annoying, in my opinion, because they are almost always externally threaded, which means the threads will have to go through your friend's ear (it can be painful if you're not careful). If your friend has been at 00g for a longish-length of time, then double flared should be no problem at all. However, some people just don't like double flared jewelry, or don't have stretchy enough skin for it.  SO...final answer...if you want to play it safe, ANYONE can wear single flared jewelry."

I was the same way when I was younger - wanted to pierce and stretch my ears when I saw others with them, but everyone said I wouldn't get a job, I'd regret it, etc etc.  I waited until I was 30 to get pierced, yes it sucked waiting and I wished I had done it earlier. Only one person so far has given me grief over my ears, and it wasn't an employer. It was a 'fellow' EMT at a conference giving me shit about them, because her ex husband had them and she didn't like them. I have never had an employer or customer say a word about them. I work IT as my main job, I'm a volunteer fire officer (Assistant Chief.) and EMT, I work per-diem at a horse track fixing betting machines, and run a landscaping business on the side of all that. Granted I won't be going past 5/8"", anything bigger I would see as a safety issue/grab point for combative patients or rogue tree branches while on a mower, but I'm adding other stuff to my ears still (I have second lobes, a rook and now an industrial). Attitude and competence really still do go a long way. That being said, if I have to be 'professional' (suit or anything but business casual) I'll put in my best polished stainless and keep it all matching, I've even received compliments due to all the 'nice matching metal' in my ears from one person at a customer site.  It may be a location thing as well, I've read people living in the Northeast and Western coastal states seem to have better luck with acceptance.

I'm an engineer and work in a corporate office environment (albeit a small corporation), and my ears are stretched to over 2 1/2 inches (67mm). Honestly, I don't think that many have an issue with 1/2 inch ears anymore.  That said, you will of course run across those who don't like them, but seriously, nurses are in such demand nowadays that it's likely they could be overlooked. I could imagine that if they got really big (like mine), they could of course be a safety issue.  Stretching up to 00g and then seeing how it affects you is a wise way to go.  Best of luck!"

I tried over and over to guid it through right behind the taper, and ended up dropping it down the drain, taking apart my sink, and still not finding it. So I was without a tunnel, had one taper in, and the other was in far enough that the biggest part of the taper was through, but it was very tight and wouldn't budge further.   I ended up just taking them out, and feeling very defeated and frustrated, with very sore ears. I'm definitely just waiting to find some 16g equipment.

Good luck!  (I must say, as I'm still in the process of restretching, I don't notice any difference in thickness yet..

I don't want to see you here in a month or two asking about blowout advice. When it comes to your body please take it slow and steady. Be patient.

Stretched,2q2fh0,eekasaur,2,Mon Dec 22 18:03:48 2014 UTC,"I agree with others your piercer is unfortunately wrong. Thats way too fast to stretch. I'll give you some ideas, but above all, just listen to your ears. There are all sorts of ""proper"" time frames to be stretching people will give you, but your body is unique and will respond uniquely to stretching.   First off, you should wait at least 6 months for the piercing to heal before stretching. This ensures the fistula forms properly and all that jazz.  Its not like a fresh stretch where a fistula is already in place - you definitely need to wait longer. After that, if you decide to stay at 6mm, I would start dead stretching 1mm at a time using single flared glass plugs (titanium is great too but I prefer glass). Using tapers at sizes larger than this is generally advised against, so the dead stretching or tape stretching methods are recommended -  though personally my ears reacted poorly to the tape so I don't prefer it. Like I said earlier, the time frame between sizes depends on your lobes and the size theyre at. I was able to stretch from 10mm to 11mm using the dead stretching method in 6 weeks, no issues whatsoever. Going from 11mm to 12.5mm in 8 weeks was a mistake though - I got a very minor blowout and should've waited another 2 weeks. So, as long as you listen to your ears and keep it pain-free and discomfort-free everything should be fine."

Stretched,2ppr1n,bigjimnm,4,Thu Dec 18 21:56:15 2014 UTC,"No problem either way. If you go without plugs at night, your holes will tighten. If you find that you're jewelry starts to get loose and you don't want to upsize, then sleeping without jewelry will help keep them from self-stretching.  I've personally found that once I passed 1 1/2 inches I have to wear something in my ears at night; otherwise, there's a risk that my lobes will get pinched during sleep and potentially injured. So I wear flexible silicone tunnels every night. My ears are currently at 2 5/8 inches, and my biggest silicone tunnels are 2 inches, so that's what I wear. Sometimes they do fall out while I sleep since they're so loose."

Stretched,2pnw0g,zaulik,6,Thu Dec 18 07:24:28 2014 UTC,"On phone so I apologize for formatting.  There are a few general standards that most of us go by that are generally safe to do, but remember that everyones body is different so you may need to adjust.  The general consensus is use high quality jewelry for stretching which is implant grade stainless steel (316LVM ASTM F-138), titainium, gold, and glass.  If you are getting anything that screws in make sure it is internally threaded.  While stretching avoid wood, stone, bone, acrylic, plastics, low quality stainless steel (marketed as 314L or surgical steel), and silicone.  In general you should just avoid acrylic period.  In a healed piercing/stretch you can wear any of the above materials, try to avoid acrylic it really is terrible, plastics should only be worn for short periods of time and there is wood that is harmful to your ears so avoid that wood as well.  What I am saying is wear High quality jewelry and more than likely you won't have many or any issues.  To start you can do a couple of things.  You can get a normal ear piercing.  If you plan to stretch let your piercer know and they will probably pierce you at a 14g or 16g.  From there I recommend that for every stretch you go to your piercer and have them stretch/put in jewelry for you.  They will probably use a high quality stainless steel taper to help stretch the ear to put in the increased sized jewelry.  Or if your hole is loose enough they may just plop it right on in there.  They will use some sort of lubricant as they do this.  Some piercers will even pierce up to a 0/00g.  I got my ears pierced at a 4g and I will say that it is not a small needle.    You can use the taping method.  You use either bondage tape or ptfe tape.  Why these tapes? They aren't nearly as porous as duct or electrical tape and even so you should rewrap every day or two.  With this method you wrap the tape around your jewelry once maybe twice every week.  And over a month or two you will eventually be able to put in your larger sized jewelry.    The natural method is basically wear heavier jewelry and over time you can just put in the next size.  Please don't confuse this with wearing weights for long periods of time to stretch that can thin out an area of your lobe which you don't want.  You want to wait at least a month, preferably two months, and longer is always safe.  Currently I wait a minimum of three months between stretches and after 6 months of being at 3/4 I am only now considering going up to 7/8 or even an inbetween size.  Patience is a virtue as they say.  A couple things to note.  After 00g size tapers are generally not used.  From here it is all natural stretching or taping method.  Some good quality companies that make quality jewelry are neometal, anatometal, bvla, industrial strength.  For silicone the only company I've seen recommended is Kaos Softwear and for good reason.  Hopefully this helped.  Pangea Piercing's videos on youtube are a good place to learn more about piercing in general.  They cover a lot of topics and you can learn a lot.  I recommend watching the terminology video.  Have fun stretching."

Stretched,2pnw0g,teleosaur,1 point,Thu Dec 18 16:43:17 2014 UTC,"As for a fresh piercing,  you wait until it's fully healed. The AVERAGE is 6 months but your body could take more/less time. I personally had my ears pierced for 8 years (was 13 when i got them done,  21 when i started to stretch). But i would wait at least the 6 months maybe closer to a year. But that is purely based on my own healing time.   The initial piercing can be done with up to a 16-14g at a reputable piercer. All depends on the piercer. You'll be instructed to leave them in for at least 6 months to heal and not play with them.  I personally used tapers and heavy titanium plugs to stretch. I didn't do oil massages etc, because i only stretched when i could just slip the jewelry in without even needing the tapers really.  As for 2g to 0g i used tape. And it sucked. I ended up having to downsize to a 4g and wait months before i could attempt again. But i had a reaction to the tape.   Overall, from a 20g to my goal size of 0/00 it took me a year with a month per size plus a downsize for 2 months."

I now wear 8g captive bead rings in them for many years, since I found 4g just too heavy, and they were pretty much always on display (they show through almost every shirt).  Nipple stretching must be done very slowly, certainly slower than earlobe stretching. Examples of good quality barbells are listed at the bottom on my reply.  For me, all I did was every 3-6 months or so was use a taper through my nipple piercing to go up to the next size. There was never much pain, and the sensation for me was very nice. I used antibiotic cream as the lubricant and kept everything clean and always wore good-quality jewelry.  I've never stretched with crescents. Potential problems (I imagine) would be that if you wore crescents with a notch in them, it would be irritating, and if you have to wear o-rings, those are going to be hard to keep everything clean.

That being said, I recommend using jojoba oil or coconut oil to massage your lobes for a couple minutes every day. It will help blood flow to your lobes to keep them healthy. Don't use Vaseline.

Stretched,2plb1f,theworstcat,1 point,Wed Dec 17 19:42:19 2014 UTC,"Depends on your size.  Stretches 16g through 12g are really not too bad/different though. The smallest single flares I've worn are 10g, it's pretty hard to find single flare plugs smaller than that.  (I've been told smaller than 6 can be breakage prone.)"
Stretched,2plb1f,fadedponds,1 point,Thu Dec 18 04:52:20 2014 UTC,"If I'm understanding you ... The question is, What's the smallest size at which you can still wear awesome looking jewelry?  I've noticed that a lot of the cooler stuff becomes available to you at 8G. I have a pair of plugs with glass jellyfish inside them that are gorgeous and a pair of sabo wood feather dangles. Unfortunately, if you want to do double flare stuff, you'll need to go about 2 sizes up (so, 4G holes for an 8G plug ... That's what I'm in the process of doing). But, you have a lot of options at 8G and it's still at the point where your ears are likely to shrink back if you need them to."
Stretched,2plb1f,noddlebritches,1 point,Thu Dec 18 18:29:57 2014 UTC,"I would suggest talking to a reputable piercer. He/she will be able to show you jewelry options in a variety of gauges and help you decide if you even need to stretch or, if you do, what your goal size should be. He/she will also be able to give you good advice on how to go about it. You can always get labret posts in a small gauge and put cool ends on them."

Stretched,2plb1f,noddlebritches,3,Wed Dec 17 17:47:40 2014 UTC,"There are probably a couple reasons. The big things are that tapers absolutely should NOT be worn as jewelry. You shouldn't need to use tapers at all, they're an insertion tool designed for piercers to use. They also advocate getting a stretching kit, which I know I, personally, would not recommend. The last thing is that they use the term ""gauges"", which is technically incorrect."
Stretched,2pif9a,Creass,11,Tue Dec 16 21:55:28 2014 UTC,"Don't take them out the next day. Instead, leave them the hell alone! Don't play with/rotate them. Give your ear some time to heal. If they are not bleeding or hurting when you insert the taper, you should be fine. Give it a few weeks before you try to take them out. Don't massage them with e oil until they are fully healed."

Stretched,2pif9a,foxhilton,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:04:24 2014 UTC,"I can't imagine they would be flared, but I would keep them in if they're already in. You don't want to disrupt your skin any more/give a chance for bacteria to infect the fresh site. Let your ears heal with them in, don't touch them for a few days. When you do, make sure your hands are clean. Gently running warm water over your ears in the shower should loosen up any funk that might build up if they move around during the day/in your sleep. With that said, any new stretches should fit without much convincing. If you're struggling to put in the next size, your ears aren't ready yet. Let them be happy :)"

Stretched,2pdmu4,FoxStilts,1 point,Mon Dec 15 19:19:22 2014 UTC,i was at a 1g and downsized to a 10g. when i sized back up i did in fact notice a slight difference in the thickness of my lobes. especially since my the piercing on my one lobe didn't leave a lot of stretching area and became pretty thing. the flare usually came past my lobe. but now that doesnt happen.  i would suggest waiting at least a month before each stretching just as you should normally.
Stretched,2pdmu4,perkachurr,1 point,Tue Dec 16 23:55:14 2014 UTC,"generally to notice any effect you have to downsize for a good 3-4 months twice a year, going down 4 sizes is a pretty standard amount and once you stretch back up it should only take about a week for all 4 sizes as the ears have good memory"
Stretched,2pdvnx,jm_beauty,2,Mon Dec 15 19:09:56 2014 UTC,"Oh I would definitely not skip anything. My ears are in insanely great shape, mostly because I stretched them up to 3/4"" over a 3-4 year long period.   The plugs I'm wearing right now are actually larger than any of the other pairs I have. They measure at 23mm on the outside, so probably 21mm on the inside (I don't have calipers, just using a measuring tape). They are made of stone so they've stretched my ears a bit and fit pretty comfortably, albeit loosely. Anything I have in 19mm is a bit too small to stay in. I don't think I'd have a problem fitting anything at 7/8"" in.   I plan to use tape to very slowly move up until I could comfortably fit in jewelry at 1"".   Edit: I'm really curious to see side by side photos of the difference in size, if anyone has any? or even just side by side jewelry."

Stretched,2p9j7q,rpgoof,1 point,Sun Dec 14 17:58:29 2014 UTC,"So just as some background, I started at 16g over a year ago (august last year). 14g and 12g I did with steel horseshoe barbells about 6 weeks apart. 10g I started using glass, and continued that through 2g. At 8g I extended my 6 weeks to roughly 2 months and I waited over three months between 4 and 2. At 2g I waited 4 months before I ever started taping. When I first started taping I was only oiling every other day and my ears started to dry out so I pulled the tape and went back to 2g. Waited another 3 weeks or so and started taping again, slowly, oiling twice a day. I was doing 2 wraps once a day. So barely anything at all. Took me probably 2.5 weeks to get them to 0g (a little larger actually) and then slid the eyelets in! So happy, they look fantastic and I feel like I'm really getting somewhere finally!

Stretched,2pbhlz,jbrown5217,10,Mon Dec 15 02:24:27 2014 UTC,"I am going to put this simply.  Stretch with good quality jewelry (please refer to the edit below for the proper stainless steel to use), titainium, gold, or glass.  Avoid acrylic, wood, stone/bone, and 314L stainless steel.  I recently got into a heated argument with someone who said he was sensitive to metals and could ""only"" use acrylic.  I made some statements and eventually suggested glass, he/she/it made some comments that laughed off my suggestion and honestly it is w/e it's he/she/its body and they can damage it if they want. The one thing I stated over and over is that I would be damned if I let someone think that stretching with acrylic is a good idea and I am going to stick with my guns.  Take out your acrylic jewelry out, downsize and save up for glass or implant grade stainless steel or titanium.  I don't care how old or impatient you are.  I care about the health of your ears and your overall health.  Using acrylic to stretch is a bad idea regardless of your experiences in the past.  It is a porous material and you increase your risk of infections and other trauma to your ears.  Save up your allowance, do odd jobs, or find other ways to make some money and buy quality jewelry.  And do not skip sizes.  Downsize back to 00g and stretch to 7/16 (11mm) then after another few months rinse and repeat and go up to 1/2 (12mm).  This isn't about ""well it has worked for me in the past"" it is about what is the safest way to stretch your ears to avoid the amazing amount of posts I see tilted like, ""help I am an idiot or help I blewout my earlobe"".  Edit:  The stainless steel you should be using is 316LVM ASTM F-138 as noted by /u/so0ks which is implant grade.  I've been stretching my ears for quite some time now and I should have known this so I truly thank /u/so0ks for the correction to the error in my posting."
Stretched,2pbhlz,so0ks,3,Mon Dec 15 05:09:11 2014 UTC,"316L is the lowest grade of steel in body jewelry you'll find. 316LVM ASTM F-138 will be implant steel.

You should really look into getting some jewelry that isn't acrylic. Even some cheap stainless steel would be better and your ears would have a better time healing. I don't change jewelry types around until my ears are comfortable and healed so they don't get irritated while they're healing.

Stretched,2p2nq9,punkylemon,7,Fri Dec 12 12:28:02 2014 UTC,"I'm gonna say the part where you felt ""resistance"" was where you screwed up. You should've stopped when it didn't want to push through. My advice is to keep your 12gs in, play with them daily and in a few weeks try the taper again, slowly, with lots of massaging and oil. Good luck!"
Stretched,2p2nq9,samesea,1 point,Fri Dec 12 14:18:12 2014 UTC,It hurts to put anything back into my piercing really so is it safe to leave nothing in my ears for a day before putting the 12s back in?
Stretched,2p2nq9,samesea,1 point,Fri Dec 12 18:24:11 2014 UTC,"You could do that but be aware your holes might close to even smaller than 12g. I'd say it's pretty safe to just clean the plugs well, clean your ears well, and put 12g plugs back in and then continue cleaning them daily until they're healed again."
Stretched,2p2nq9,orangebranch,7,Fri Dec 12 18:39:30 2014 UTC,"Seems you went wrong by skipping a size going from 12g to 8g, and then ""downsizing"" to 10g two days later. I think you may have micro-torn your ear in the 8g stretch. The wound may have stopped bleeding when you went back to 12g but opened up again when you went to 10g (I don't know if that's a thing, but it sounds plausible to me based on my own experience).  I would go back to the 12s and wait for them to heal (a couple months) before trying to go from 12g to 10g again."

I've let them close up twice (not completely) and not until this time can i stretch semi quickly. Your lobes aren't used to it yet.

Was the taper acrylic or steel?"

I dont know if youre familiar with the modified world, but they have a pretty helpful piercing guide. I myself do not yet have stretched ears, but its bad for the same reasons that you dont use piercing guns, plastic, acrylic, and external threading on any piercing. Its just not good. Go with titanium or something and go slow."
Stretched,2oxcy4,Loveless1997,1 point,Sun Dec 14 08:09:39 2014 UTC,The best thing to do is go back to a 4g with high quality jewelry like titanium/glass/industrial strength and clean using Sea salt soaks. Either that or get some h2ocean or whatever it is that people love and clean the piercings. And leave them alone. Wait a month. If your ears feel fine then buy some tape and tape up. That's safer than what you did and you could safely stretch. Please take care of your ears hun

Stretched,2or8op,reindeergumbo,5,Wed Dec 10 13:10:16 2014 UTC,"Assuming this is in the US, yes they can. They won't do it directly. If you still want the position, and beleive these people are too iffy about that sort of thing, here's a few things you can do to make it look more ""professional:""   If you are near a few piercing shops, scope them out for some skin colored plugs your size and skin tone.  These are silicone and are porous, so if you're still not healed, keep them in for the duration of the interview and then immediately switch them out.  If you happen to be at 1-2G, erasers with a little concealer fit this size, but are mostly more unsanitary, so I wouldn't advise it unless there is no other option. Erasers are also porous.  These won't completely cover it up, but it will give the employer the impression that you're trying to look professional despite taking on a piercing that is untraditional, much like bioflex in a facial piercing.  OR: If you are a girl, put a tunnel through your lobe. Get a piece of sticky tack and stick it through the bar of a pearl or other large earring, all the way to the base, and stick it through the tunnel. This will adhere the earring to the front of the tunnel and make it look like it's just a small earring. Simply put a matching tunnel through the other ear. This only works up to a 2G tunnel.  OR: Once again, girl one. If you're at a smaller size (under 4G) you can get some heavy dangly earrings and your lobe won't necessarily look stretched because of your own method, but because you wear large earrings. Your stretch should hold for the duration of the interview assuming you stretched correctly. Take note this is a relatively more sore-inducing method.  Many will say if your employer doesn't agree with your mods, it's not a job you want, but I understand sometimes a job is a job, and at a certain point in your life, you will have to take what you can get."

Stretched,2or8op,jbrown5217,1 point,Tue Dec 9 18:19:47 2014 UTC,g stands for gauge which is another type of measurement for jewelry.  Gauge sizes start at 22g (or around that I forget specifics) and go to 00g which is equal to 9 or 10mm.  Your gauge size is proly right around a 4g or 6g if you are at 5mm.    When I was looking for a job I wore fleshtone silicone plugs.  They are probably your best bet.  Although if you aren't healed at your current size I would reccommend not wearing any jewelry.  It is better to go down a size then damage your lobes.

Stretched,2or8op,deepseaglowy,2,Tue Dec 9 16:34:05 2014 UTC,"Materials in various jewelry can damage or harm your lobes by wearing them especially if you just stretched to a certain size or you are still in the healing process after a stretch.  Materials that cause this are:  Silicone, wood, acrylic, and low quality jewelry in general (while not a material still worthy of being noted).  Most of these are porous and can cause harm while you are going through the healing process or if you use them to stretch.  Is it going to affect everyone who uses the material, no, but it is a good rule of thumb to stay away from those materials while stretching your ears.   I like to use this link in the sidebar that shows what can happen if you do."
Stretched,2osaef,smashleys,3,Tue Dec 9 19:47:41 2014 UTC,"I'm not a pro, but I used to be at 6g until my ears blew out, when you make each stretch, make sure to use plugs or tunnels that don't have the indents for the o rings on them, they really shred up your ears, and use glass or titanium jewelry for initial stretches. Other than that, I assume you know the basics like lubing up the tapers, taping, not skipping sizes, waiting 1-3 months before each stretch, and sea salt soaks. Also, make sure not to remove your jewelry for atleast a week or a little more (in my case). This is all from my experience, so other people might have different opinions."

EDIT:  I will also note that I do not live with my parents anymore and while I chose to stretch while I was living with them, please think of potential consequences and if you are willing to live with them if you plan to stretch while living with your parents.

She's convinced I will never get a job or meet a nice girl. Every time I visit she keeps asking if I've stretched again or am I going to take them out. I just say no and I can always try to downsize if I have to. My advice would be not to stretch to a large size at a young age, you never know what opportunities could come up in the future and having large lobes could leave a bad first impression to some people."

I already planned to stretch, I was just unsure of how big. When I finally bought the 14g jewelry and announced my plans, my mom literally broke down in tears saying I would never find a job, I would never be respected, and that my family would judge her for it.   Fast forward 3 years later, I'm training to be a manager, and my family or the general public, for that matter, couldn't care less. She even tells me her opinion on if my choice in plugs is good or not. My best advice is, if you live under their roof, you have to live by their rules. If they're against it, maybe set a small size as your initial goal, show them pictures of the size, and promise you won't go any further than that - and don't break the promise."

My Dad was never particularly supportive of my bodymods (huge stretched ears, extensive tattoos covering much of my body, stretched labret, septum and nipple piercings), but since I didn't embark on any of it until I was an adult and out of his house, he certainly didn't have any say in the matter.  It's been well over a decade since my ears were getting obviously stretched, and although he still doesn't like them, he doesn't say anything anymore.  But, if you are 18 and still relying on your parents' money (e.g. living with them without paying rent), then they can have more of a say. In my opinion, one doesn't become an adult simply by passing a certain age. It is more about acting and behaving like an adult.

First of all, it's almost certainly not an ""infection"" that you get every time. It's just irritation (swelling, lymph, etc.) and the healing process after tearing your ears.  Second, stretching really does not hurt for anyone who does it correctly.   Third, why the fuck would you start your stretch if you didn't even have jewelry of the correct size? Where did you even get a taper that big? If your ear ""wasn't ready for jewelry"" then it wasn't ready for the stretch at all.  Stretching probably hurts so much for you because you have an insane amount of scar tissue from years of abusing your lobes, and scar tissue really isn't stretchy.  But I know you won't listen to any of this anyway, so keep on being upset when stretching doesn't go well for you."

What kind of material are you wearing for your jewelry? Is it possible that your constant infection/irritations are from a reaction to a specific material?   Do you do salt soaks when your ears act up? They really do help.   It sounds like you just have so much scar tissue. You might have some success with lots of massages to help break some of the fresher tissue up, but it's highly likely that some of it is there for good."

Now I'm at a 4g and when I take mine out for school sometimes, my left ear goes down to a 6g and my right stays the same.  It really all depends on your body like you said before. But going to such a small size like a 6g you should most likely have no problem closing them up whenever you feel like it especially if you take it slow, do regular cleanings, salt water soaks, massages, and avoid shit like acrylic.

Stretched,2om9y7,TwoSparks,4,Mon Dec 8 15:14:05 2014 UTC,"First, I am appalled by the responses of many people here to what I assume to be a perfectly reasonable question. I've worn the same nipple rings for nearly 10 years, and so I consider that a ""semi-permanent"" piercing, so it's not such a stretch to assume the same regarding plugs.  Regardless, the OP never mentioned that he had any issues with his current jewelry regarding the health of his earlobes or anything like that. It doesn't sound like they're fused to his ear.  However, it is likely that you won't be able to remove the jewelry with such large flares after having been in so long, so they most likely will need to be broken to remove them.  Going down to a 8g should be no problem. I can go from 2 5/8 inches down to 2 inches no problem, so going down less than 2mm won't be an issue."
Stretched,2om9y7,TwoSparks,3,Wed Dec 10 05:34:21 2014 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to reply :)
Stretched,2om9y7,cocomyokonos,1 point,Wed Dec 10 15:29:50 2014 UTC,"TL;DR I skimmed. But here is my 2 cents. It is NOT perfectly normal to leave plugs in for years without ever taking them out. It is good to wash them daily and to go periods of time without them in to let the piercing ""rest"". With that being said, if you can push them out that far and clean them, I see nothing wrong with it. It's just not normal. But fuck normal, right? Anyway, I would just get a little buzz, lube them up real good, and pull them out. BTW, what is a 3/6 gauge?"
Stretched,2om9y7,OneEyedOneHorned,-4,Mon Jan 5 05:29:55 2015 UTC,"... Wut?  Now, I just need to confirm because I'm as in shock as the other two posters... You stretched your ear to 6g 14 years ago. You then proceeded to put in 6g saddle/double flare plugs, and then you left them untouched for the next FOURTEEN YEARS?! Is that correct? Please tell me that isn't correct.   If that is correct, I am absolutely stunned. I mean, I don't wear double flares because my ears get pissed taking them in and out, so I'm not the most super knowledgeable on the ins and outs of wearing these (though, I would like to say... Wow, you managed to get double flares in at 6g? I tried once. Literally impossible for me; I couldn't even do it once I was at 0g. Either your ears are delightfully stretchy or you did major damage getting those in there, but I'm getting off topic...), but as far as I can imagine, unless your ears are stretched quiet large -- thus adding significant weight to your ears just by the sheer size of your plugs and allowing them to stay quiet stretchy -- double flares shouldn't be worn super long term without taking them out. I mean, technically that goes for any plugs/eyelets, really. 'Cause, you know, you have to take them off to clean your lobes and massage your ears with oil... Like, everyday. But I've been there and know that sometimes a person gets lazy and misses a few days, but with double flares even doing that is a big no-no as far as I'm aware. Because in taking out the double flares daily, you keep your ears stretchy and don't let them get ""comfortable"" around the wearable area which is a smaller gauge than the outside edges. Because if you let them get too comfortable and adjust to the gauge of the wearable area, getting them out will be really hard, if not impossible.   Now, in regards to downsizing from 6g to 8g... Touch to say. Normally no problem, but you've been at 6g for 14 years, so there is a chance your ears won't shrink down, but the size you're at is still so small that chances are good. Honestly, though, those are the least of your problems right now. Jesus, I can't even imagine the ear gunk that has built up in your ears... Or hell, how they must smell without being cleaned! Yikes. For now, focus on just trying to get the double flares out. Now, I don't know that this will work, but it should be the first thing you try...  For the next few months (yes, months), invest in some jojoba oil. Every morning, use the oil and massage your lobes around your piercing. Don't get violent with the massages and hurt yourself, but don't be gentle. Give it a really good 5 - 10 minute of thorough, deep massages. Even tug gently on your lobes a little, get them stretch. Whenever you're in the shower, after about 5 minutes under the hot water, massage/tug on them gently. Repeat in the evening. And basically keep your fingers crossed that your ears will naturally loosen up enough to let you pop them out with minimal pain/trauma. Every few weeks, lube up your ears with the oil and try to get them out after a massage. If they won't budge, don't force it. You don't want to traumatize your ear and cause swelling. That will slow down the process. If after 6 months, you've got no luck, then you are going to have to cut them out if you want them out. But don't just grab a tool kit and start hacking willy nilly. Go see a piercer, see what they say (actually, maybe do that first, but if they just offer to try and help you pry them out on the spot, you should go get a second opinion. If they can help you cut it out, let them... Or just jump right into my recommended method of getting them out, and if it doesn't work then return to them so they can cut the jewellery off.)  Good luck... And dude, don't pull this kinda stuff again. Either take care of your ears daily like you're supposed to, or just stick to single flares."

I'm pretty sure I remember the gauges correctly, but you seem shocked to hear they're 3 on the ends and 6 in the middle. This seems to be a very common taper in size according to saddles I've been browsing online. I just measured them and they're roughly 1/4"" on the ends and 1/8"" in the middle. They're about 1/2"" long. According to a gauge chart, this seems to match my memory of a 3g/6g size. (They look almost identical to the ones on the far left).  So as you can see, they have a fairly slender ratio. I can move them freely and easily back and forth in my lobes allowing me to wash them regularly. There is no gunk, there is no smell. I was under the impression that people who put in saddles just left them in. Yes, I safely stretched my ears to the larger diameter, then put the saddles in and they ""healed"" up just fine. There is no damage or scar tissue. As you said yourself, your ears get pissed taking flares in and out so I never assumed swapping saddles on the reg was normal. Re-stretching lobes every time you feel like a different style seems a bit dangerous to me and when I decided to put them in, I was comfortable knowing they were similar to a tattoo in regard to permanence.   So on to more proactive discussion...   I'm not keen on spending the next six months fucking with my lobes to get them out. If the advice you're offering is accurate, I'll just use a Dremel to cut them in half. (Again, they're of ample length for me to pull through my lobes, giving me plenty of space to saw through the thinnest part.) If it's not safe to try and force another pair of 3g/6g saddles through (I'll be left with a 6g hole, obviously) then I'll just downsize to an 8g, which should have something like a 5g on the ends. Surely that can be done in one day. I may head up to my local head shop to see what their piercer has to say first though, as the info I'm getting here is, uh, questionable.   Thanks again for chiming in, but please know that I have taken care of my ears daily."
Stretched,2om9y7,TwoSparks,-1,Mon Dec 8 16:05:03 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're reading between the lines or misunderstanding...  I'm not shocked about hearing that they are 3g on the ends and 6g in the middle; I never even mentioned anything about that. (Actually, to be fair, I didn't even understand what you were talking about when you said ""3"" as I've never encountered anyone who actually takes into account/mentions the gauge of the lip of the flares so I was skimming over that part entirely. On that note, I've never even heard of 3g. I've heard of the uncommon 1g, but not 3g... So.) And I don't know if I would say prejudice as much as stunned and terrified by your lack of knowledge (I say this based on your reply to /u/Damn-it-man in which you said:   Yeah, since they're saddles, they're semi-permanent right? I never bothered trying to take them out since it would involve destroying the stones or trying to re-stretch my lobes.   You claim that I'm misinformed, but it seems like you are. I admitted that I don't wear double flares as a disclosure that I'm not a veteran of the double flare, but I know enough that no, saddles/double flares are not ""semi-permanent."" And taking them out most certainly does not involve destroying the plugs or re-stretching your lobes. Not at all. That is why most people avoid double flares until they are at larger sizes; though they can sometimes be a little tricky, one should be able to take double flared plugs out without a problem. If you can't, it is because you haven't stretched large enough for your ear to handle it, because it is usually extremely difficult at such a small gauge. I also never said anything about whether you stretched safely or not, nor did I mention anything about scar tissue. So, not sure where you're getting that. And the only thing in regards to stretching being considered permanent is the act of stretching itself (as there are no guarantees that your piercing will ever shrink to original size), but not the type of jewellery you choose. So please consider that you are the one misinformed; I'm simply trying to educate you.  Feel free to use a dremel to cut them off; I gave the advice that I did based on the assumption that you didn't want to destroy your jewellery needlessly since that isn't how it is supposed to work. But if you don't give a shit, then by all means cut them off. And the whole ""surely that can be done in one day"" talk is really the epitome of uninformed. Nothing is guaranteed, and typically not within a day -- especially considering they've been stretched for 14 years. The reason this is significant is because over time, skin looses elasticity. Thus, its ability to ""snap back"" is reduced as people age. That is why at 20 you have lovely taut skin, but as you age your face gets wrinkly and saggy. Same thing applies with ears; the elasticity of your ears has decreased over the years since you first stretched, so there is a chance that your ears may not ""snap back."" But that is why I followed up with the fact that chances are good for you, though, because you are at such a small size so your ears haven't been very affected by weight over the years.  The info you're getting here from myself is not ""questionable"", actually, and that should be apparent by the other posters being utterly stunned by your lack of knowledge to the point that they don't even offer advice -- they are literally speechless -- considering you've had this modification for so long, and providing you with .gifs saying how absolutely wrong your thinking is and how little you know about the practice of stretching. Please, please, please educate yourself before you proceed."
Stretched,2om9y7,Eminetics,-2,Mon Dec 8 16:55:51 2014 UTC,"First off, I thought we'd all be friends here. But I was without-a-doubt attacked with hyperbole and prejudice:    absolutely stunned did major damage getting those in Jesus, I can't even imagine the ear gunk that has built up in your ears... Or hell, how they must smell without being cleaned! Yikes. stunned and terrified by your lack of knowledge  utterly stunned by your lack of knowledge to the point that they don't even offer advice -- they are literally speechless wrong your thinking is and how little you know about the practice of stretching   Again, I appreciate your help, considering all of the other brain surgeons in here have literally dropped dead from my earth-shattering disregard for the dogma of body modification and my utter disrespect to Lord Stretch. (Seriously, do you people think you're a bunch of Rhodes Scholars with multiple degrees in the technical and rigorous study of Putting Holes All Over Your Face? Get off your fucking high-horse; we're talking about piercings, not the Rosetta Probe.)  But just to solidify my blacklisting, I'd like to point out that your only source of expertise comes from your tag citing 11mm plugs. (What an accomplishment, your parents must be beaming.) Your posts are riddled with judgement, hypocrisy and hearsay.   I'm not shocked about hearing that they are 3g on the ends and 6g in the middle; I never even mentioned anything about that.   Actually, you did:   though, I would like to say... Wow, you managed to get double flares in at 6g? I tried once. Literally impossible for me; I couldn't even do it once I was at 0g. Either your ears are delightfully stretchy or you did major damage getting those in there, but I'm getting off topic...   I felt the need to clarify that they were 3g on the ends and 6g in the middle because it seemed to me that you didn't understand their shape, due to your surprise of me getting them in in the first place. What's so shocking about getting 6g saddles in? They come in sizes up to 2"", don't they?  And as for the 3g - it's been 14 fucking years. I don't hang out at my local tattoo shop/Center For Academic Advancement. Aside from the fact that memory may be a little fuzzy (which I humbly admitted multiple times) I am almost certain I ordered them from this site: http://www.organicjewelry.com/amber.html which still hosts an entry for their 6ga amber plugs stating ""$8/pair (all our remaining 6ga are discounted from $10-$12/pair due to quality issues or slight flaws, such as minor indentations (divets), texture on the faces, not quite round flares, or >6ga with flares a bit larger than normal, at around 3ga.) Even though my plugs are in seemingly perfect shape, it's quite possible they were sold as 6g/3g at one time. I know I'm splitting hairs here, but since you felt the need to dissect my imperfect posts, I felt the need to highlight YOUR shortcomings as well.    Please, please, please educate yourself before you proceed.   Oh I will! I've already booked a flight to Cambridge, where I'll be meeting with an esteemed congregation of figureheads in the field of ""Lobe Adjustment and Its Ramifications on Personal Health and the Advancement of Contemporary Culture."" I'm sure the PhDs will be stunned yet excited to study such a rare specimen of cochleal alteration!"
Stretched,2om9y7,Eminetics,5,Mon Dec 8 17:41:32 2014 UTC,"Don't know why you feel the need to attack  -- I hope it makes you feel better about yourself, I suppose.   I'm allowed to be stunned; you can't tell me how to feel about the things I read. I never said you did major damage getting them in, I was saying that I could only imagine you got them in be either having very stretchy lobes OR having done damage -- this was in reference to how difficult smaller gauged double flares are to insert, not claiming that you actually did the damage.  I'm entitled to be surprised at how one can thoroughly clean their ears and the jewellery when they do not remove them and suspicious of how effective cleaning without removing them can be. Again, I'm allowed to be stunned. And also terrified. The people did not offer advice. Just the equivalent of holy cow -- does that not count as speechless to you? Telling someone they are wrong when they are wrong isn't prejudice, it is called correction and education.    No one is on a high-horse. You're just mad because everyone here pointed out that you have numerous misconceptions about stretching. No one here claims to be Stretchor, God of the Stretch, or that you need ""rigorous study"" in order to have stretched ears. What you do need, though -- as anyone does in any matter -- is to educate yourself BEFORE following through with something. Not after. You wouldn't go for a nose job without researching the procedure and the surgeon thoroughly in order to determine 100% that you're okay with what is going on and have aftercare knowledge, would you? Same thing applies with stretching. Do your research and educate yourself -- either by looking things up online or by consulting with people who know about these things. The fact that you're here thinking that double flares are ""semi-permanent"" shows that you haven't done this, which is why I'm encouraging you to do research. You say it has been ""14 fucking years"" and that your memory is a bit fuzzy, but obviously 14 years ago you didn't do the research either or you would have known to not do what you did. I'm trying to help you for fuck sake, and you're being obnoxious and combative. Remember, you came here.  Also, what does my 11mm ears have to do with anything? Just because I don't have 30mm ears, my 5+ years of stretching and 10+ years of getting pierced is invalid? You're totally ridiculous, lol. My personal aesthetic preferences or choices do not detract from the fact that I have spent years educating myself before any and all body mod procedures. It isn't about the size of the stretch as much as it is the quality of the lobes, my friend. And if you're going to get ""size-ist"" on me, maybe talk when your lobes aren't a teeny 4mm and have plugs stuck in them that you can only get out with power tools, 'kay? ""Just because mine aren't as big as yours, doesn't make what I say invalid,"" I hear you shriek. Oh? Really? Didn't I just say something about that? Hmm.   And yes, I did say:   though, I would like to say... Wow, you managed to get double flares in at 6g? I tried once. Literally impossible for me; I couldn't even do it once I was at 0g. Either your ears are delightfully stretchy or you did major damage getting those in there, but I'm getting off topic...   But what does that have to do with the specification of 3g? Nothing. I understand their shape perfectly. Saddles, aka double flare. Bigger on the outside than the inside. And it is exactly that which makes me surprised -- ask anyone double flares are a challenge at smaller sizes. Yes, they make them as large as 2"" -- and bigger than that, too! But at those sizes, its significantly easier to get them in. Which is exactly what I said about it being much easier at larger sizes, and since it is easier at larger sizes, it is surprising that you got it in at a smaller size. See how logic works?  Now how about you stop abusing the people trying to give you the advice that you asked for and either smile and take it, politely decline it, or stop talking.  And yes, in case you needed clarification, there is now a prejudice tone in my text because you've come off as an absolute d-bag."
Stretched,2om9y7,Romeo_horse_cock,5,Mon Dec 8 18:36:54 2014 UTC,"Okay, I usually hate getting into this stuff but I feel the need to just add something in here.  OP came here for advice and help... He made zero claims in his original post about being an expert, in fact the very act of posting indicates to me that he was deferring to the greater knowledge of this community and thus acknowledging his lack of expertise.  You're right; you do have a right to be stunned, but taken with the overall tone of your comment, your astonishment (and reiteration of such) just seems patronizing. And while I believe that this wasn't your intention, I think maybe you should try to re-read your comments from another point of view. All of your advice and even your shock could have been communicated in a much more friendly and understanding manner!   I only say all of this because when I originally came to this subreddit a while back I posted some honest beginner's questions (with a different account) and was met with resounding condemnation and an astonishing lack of consideration. I was presented with so many worst-case-scenarios and judgements that I actually took my tunnels out and didn't start stretching again for a year because I was a) petrified that I would ruin my ears with even the tiniest mistake, and unsure of which self-proclaimed expert's advice to follow and b) repulsed by the self-righteous attitude of people whose modifications and lifestyles I had admired.  So with that said, I'm not trying to attack you here.... I know you meant well but I just wanted to suggest a re-evaluation for the sake of future encounters, and the environment of this subreddit. I never post or comment here because I find that I am much more likely to be received with hostility and belittlement than genuine helpfulness."
Stretched,2om9y7,Eminetics,-6,Thu Dec 11 05:29:25 2014 UTC,"I don't know shit about stretching, and frankly I don't care. That's why I came here. But I came in hopes of finding someone who had worn plugs for a great while - who could offer actual advice - rather than a load of BS someone like you seems to have collected from Xeroxed pamphlets handed out at your neighborhood crack-house and self-esteem emporium. I mentioned the size of your badass 11mm plugs because that's all you offered in terms of legitimacy. Are you a doctor? Are you a nurse? Are you a professional in any regard at all? How much experience do you have? You wanna know how much I have? Fourteen-fucking years with little pieces of amber in my ears that have never given me even the slightest itch. I'd say that puts an end to all of your presumptions about smell and gunk and whatever-else you or one of your street-urchin friends might have had to deal with in the past. I'm sorry this goes against everything that you have learned about stretching, but it's the truth. Read my keys: my plugs have sat in my ear lobes for fourteen years, been washed several times a week and have never smelled, itched, irritated, reddened, leaked, squeaked or given me the slightest bit of discomfort. They're just there. I'm in no way saying this sort of luck is universal, or safe for plugs of larger sizes, but it is my experience.   Here's a little insight into the illustrious mod ""industry,"" McStretch, MD: it's mostly bullshit. I've been to six different tattoo artists in so many states and you know what? Every single one has given me different after-care advice. It doesn't mean that any of them are wrong, it means that - just like an actual 6-year degree in medicine - it's all a practice. There are laws of mathematics and laws of physics, but no laws of body mods. And, as an aside, the term ""education"" really doesn't come into play; we're talking about motherfucking earrings, not the complexities of the human genome. So it's really swell that you've toiled over massive volumes of Encyclopedia Modificatia for the past six weeks and you now feel accomplished at SOMETHING in your life, but my actual experience with plugs in my own body has told me day after day that there's absolutely nothing wrong with leaving them in. Oh, and I've also now had the opinions and hands-on approval from four employees of a 42-year-old tattoo and piercing studio here in town, who assured me that not only are MY ears perfectly clean and healthy, but ""as far as [they] know, it's perfectly normal to leave saddle plugs in for years at a time.""  So the next time someone wanders in here, HUMBLY asking for advice and you feel like being a grade-A cocksucker with a massive inferiority complex and replying with opinions like ""Jesus, I can't even imagine the ear gunk that has built up in your ears... Or hell, how they must smell without being cleaned! Yikes."" You might wanna take stock of your own life experience and your own wisdom, because after speaking with the owner, a sales clerk and two fucking artists at this local studio, I've come to realize you and everyone else in this thread who've given me shit are fucking morons.   If there actually are active mods in this 19-year-old-circle-jerk of a community, I'll probably be banned, but just in case I'm not, I'll be sure to get some pics up of my ears before, during and after the switch, to provide evidence that daily care for permanent plugs is completely possible and not at all ""stunning"" to the point of causing ""speechless""-ness in all the Oracles that oversee this bastion of human knowledge.

Stretched,2olczx,Drewdle883,3,Sun Dec 7 23:23:59 2014 UTC,"First things first...1.6mm to 3mm is skipping sizes. Put the 1.6 back in and leave those in for at least a couple months. Your first stretch after those have healed should be to 2mm. This is why there has been so much blood and pain. A correct stretch should have some minor stinging, if anything...blood and pain are BAD signs...and as soon as you see/experience these, you should downsize immediately.  You say stretcher...what kind of jewelry are you referring to? If it's a taper, that isn't jewelry, it should only be used to stretch up...get some real jewelry in there ASAP. If it is a plug, ring, or other kind of jewelry, it should be of a good material (steel, titanium, glass) and NOT something unsuitable for fresh stretches, like acrylic. Stop pulling blood or ANYTHING off your ears...never pull. Do sea salt soaks to soak anything off. Don't touch them, and if you MUST try to adjust anything on your ears, wash your hands first.   Look at the sidebar on this sub for stretching advice. It's under the ""want to stretch?"" section. That will give you some guidelines on how long to wait, what size to go to next, what jewelry is suitable, etc."
Stretched,2olczx,eekasaur,2,Mon Dec 8 00:15:13 2014 UTC,"You should take them out as soon as possible, let your ears heal, and get them repierced. Opening a 4 year old healed piercing with a stud is not a good idea, but even if it was fine and fully healed, you've stretched way too fast. A fully healed piercing (6 months) can be stretched usually at about a pace of 1 size per month. Or you could just get pierced at 3mm. Using metal tapers to stretch is okay at smaller sizes, but if you wear them your piercing will heal unevenly. Wear glass or metal plugs instead. You should not be experiencing any pain when stretching your piercings - thats a sign you're going too fast."
