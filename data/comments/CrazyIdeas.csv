A roommate of mine is a football player though, a huge one at that, and he goes out to play soccer with another roommate of mine regularly who is very good. While he isn't the best on the field, his football training to be balanced on his feet while 250 pound men are slamming into him make him more than competent with footwork, and it's just practice learning how to handle the ball properly. With proper dribbling and shooting lessons you'd be surprised how many football players, especially people who are meant to have possession of the ball and outrun and dodge people, could be top soccer athletes. As far as their training goes, they don't have nearly as much downtown during the 6 days a week they practice as they do during the one day they play a game."

Bringing cameras into a voting booth (in the US, at least) is illegal, so you would have to either be really sneaky about it (assuming the cops or some snitch aren't spying on you), or participate in mass civil disobedience before something like this could be pulled off.  Edit: Although I have come to some doubts. There are some people who say, for example, that they are Democrat but secretly vote Republican or Libertarian because they might believe that the latter generally aren't as well-received in public as the former. They say one thing but do another. They might post their pic and then change their vote just before they cast it."

As someone who is a scientist who studies memes, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jokes memes. If you want to be “specific” like you said, then you shouldn’t either. They’re not the same thing. If you’re saying “meme family” you’re referring to the taxonomic grouping of Maymaydae, which includes things from rage comics to image macros to verticals. So your reasoning for calling a joke a meme is because random people “call the funny ones memes?” Let’s get reaction gifs and anime in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a memer or a narwhal baconer? It’s not one or the other, that’s not how taxonomy works. They’re both. A joke is a joke and a member of the meme family. But that’s not what you said. You said a joke is a meme, which is not true unless you’re okay with calling all members of the meme family memes, which means you’d call dub checks, rage comics, and other things memes, too. Which you said you don’t. It’s okay to just admit you’re wrong, you know?"

CrazyIdeas,3dqd5k,Rufus_T_Firefly_,5,Sat Jul 18 16:51:43 2015 UTC,"Actually navigating a spacecraft is relatively easy. (For a computer)  Most of the cost comes from:   Scientific instruments and other parts that are one of a kind and more or less made by hand to very tight specifications. Also those parts have to be rigorously tested. Everything has to be built to last because if a part on NH breaks, it's going to stay broken. In order to get NH to Pluto before all your scientists die of old age, you need to go really fast, which means you need a small spacecraft and a big rocket. Big rockets aren't cheap. Even with a big rocket, it took NH 10 years to get to Pluto. During that time you need people and equipment back home to keep an eye on things in case a software update or course correction is required."

It's not like video games haven't had their fair share of success with this approach. I think it's a completely feasible idea, and although they are mostly massive budget films to begin with, I think the superhero genre would be a perfect fit for this. Imagine an Avengers film where voting a certain way will kill certain characters, or result in cameos by other Marvel characters. Oh, you didn't see the version where Black Widow almost got killed, but Spider-Man swept in and saved her ass at the very last second? Bummer, better go watch it again, and vote differently this time.   There would be subreddits dedicated to mapping out each path the film could take, based on the individual choices made. Film screenings organized by groups who all agree in advance to vote a certain way, in order to view the version of the film they wish to see, and inevitably, groups of trolls who organize in much the same manner, but try to outvote the other group and force them to view the same shitty ending time and time again.

CrazyIdeas,3dtxsr,Nevadadrifter,2,Sun Jul 19 18:18:48 2015 UTC,"AMC and IMAX theaters have both toyed around with having mobile device friendly screenings of some films. Cinemark theaters have a mobile app that automatically turns your brightness to minimum, mutes your volume, and rewards you with free snacks for keeping your phone in ""CineMode"" for the duration of a film. Really, the whole thing would be an issue of cost. If a major studio decides to give this a shot, it's most likely going to be one-off trial run, and a mobile app would be far easier to develop than purchasing/leasing a voting box and accompanying computer system for every theater that's going to be running that film. And if you want to get really nefarious with it, you could let people opt in to logging in through Facebook with the promise of deleted scenes or other digital goodies, and collect all their personal data...   As a film nut, I personally can't stand the idea of allowing people to have their phones out during a film. It seems like film and home movies/TV are moving in opposite directions. Most theaters are still running the annoying, nagging commercials to silence your phone before a film, while there are a multitude of ""second screen"" experiences available for watching both TV and movies at home."
