fantasybaseball,3e42s6,nate317,12,Tue Jul 21 20:14:46 2015 UTC,homeruns dont count towards BABIP and hes been hitting a lot of them recently
fantasybaseball,3e42s6,bceagle411,4,Tue Jul 21 20:25:30 2015 UTC,"That explains part of it, but it also suggests that he's been unlucky on the balls he hasn't hit out of the park. So you would still expect it to be hanging around close to his career avg or probably a little below his career avg."
fantasybaseball,3e42s6,honey_baked_bham,2,Tue Jul 21 20:39:34 2015 UTC,"older, slower, power guys tend to have a lower BABIP. while i doubt it stays this low, i wouldn't be surprised if it stayed below league average ROS"
fantasybaseball,3e42s6,mdrico21,2,Tue Jul 21 22:50:43 2015 UTC,"I traded Pujols away in a dynasty league for Abreu.  Not sure how I feel yet about it. But I know in the long run, Abreu will obviously pay off longer than Pujols."
fantasybaseball,3e42s6,zuckuss00,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:32:05 2015 UTC,BABIP excludes HR.   He still should hit around .260 and hit another 12-15 HR. The .292 ISO won't last.
fantasybaseball,3e42s6,lakehousebytheriver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:41 2015 UTC,It's low because of his bum foot. Any groundball is basically an out.
fantasybaseball,3e42s6,prime416,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:41:14 2015 UTC,"Albert hasn't run out a ground ball since 2009, so that may explain the low BABIP."
fantasybaseball,3e42s6,Scanlon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:08:25 2015 UTC,"I traded him, wish I woulda held him a little longer to get someone better in return. I was in need of OF help so I traded him for Blackmon. Aye aye aye."
fantasybaseball,3e42s6,Jag13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:09 2015 UTC,Blackmon's possibly better than Pujols ROS. Probably similar. Lose some power gain some speed.
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,Stonewater,3,Tue Jul 21 19:58:59 2015 UTC,"Great work as always.   I'm a bit worried about Iwakuma, his stuff just looks incredibly bland. Can you please share some thoughts on ranking him 42.  Also agree with fawkes that Tillman deserves to be on the top 100. Thought he was showing signs of improvement even before this last gem, and was the definition of a serviceable horse in 2013,14  More importantly, if you want a good laugh I'd recommend watching Oliver Perez and his new windup."
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,NextLevelFantasy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:42:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks NLF!  Sadly it isn't reflecting in our league...Let's not talk about that.  I don't have much of a reason to believe that Iwakuma can't come close to replicating his 2014 campaign which were Top 30 numbers.  His floor is higher due to a miniscule walk rate, he can keep the strikeouts alive with his Splitter and as long as he maintains an average HR/FB (27% HR/FB so far!), I see good things ahead.  I'm willing to throw out his injury-laden April and first start back for the most part, and he's been solid since in those two starts.  I just can't seem to get on the Tillman train.  Sure, he's been a bit better lately, but I just can't trust a guy who still holds ERA/FIP/xFIP all well over 4.00 and nothing encouraging in the K/BB department (3.58 BB/9!).  He doesn't have the upside that would make you look over those numbers for the reward attached to a recent string of good starts.  And oh man, Ollie, what are you doing bud.  Thanks for that."
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,sideshwtodd,2,Tue Jul 21 22:33:29 2015 UTC,A quick nitpick and a question:  Kluber hasn't been as dominant this year. Why still ahead of Grienke?  Any lower owned pitchers we should maybe jump on before a potential trade?  Edit: I also wanted to thank you for the List. This is my first year doing Fantasy Baseball after doing football for years. Your list has helped propel my team to first place.
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,schwab002,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:44 2015 UTC,"Player A: 10.15 K/9, 1.85 BB/9, 2.47 FIP, 2.71 xFIP.  Player B:  8.02 K/9, 1.44 BB/9, 2.52 FIP, 3.05 xFIP.  I think you can guess who is who.  Trades are very finicky and it's tough to predict how a pitcher will respond being moved to a separate organization.  The only guy I can think of is Joe Ross, who would greatly benefit if a fellow Nationals pitcher was dealt, as it would give him a firm spot in the rotation.  I don't think that happens, but you should own him for today's start against the Mets anyway.  I'm happy you've enjoyed The List!  It's fun to make, and I'm glad it's helped you during your season."
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,BizarreBill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:06 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you about Kluber. He's been solid, with flashes of brilliance but overall he just hasnt been good or steady enough to be that highly ranked. I'd drop him to 10th or even a bit lower.  I do hope he pulls it together for a dominant 2nd half though."
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,cock_almighty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:57 2015 UTC,"how do you think the marlins will treat fernandez the rest of the year. are they going to shut him down early in a lost season or let him play it out and get his arm stretched. wondering if hell be there when you need him most(fantasy playoffs)     also has anyone watched him pitch. does he look as sharp as last year, velo and command good?"
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,cock_almighty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:41 2015 UTC,"He won't have many innings logged by September, so I imagine he'll be treated like a normal SP through the rest of the season, albeit with fewer 100+ pitches games.  I did a Breakdown of his first start and watched his other two as well.  He looks like the Jose of old.  He's back."

These rankings were more so my viewpoint of how I view them in real life, not so much in fantasy terms."
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,kdamp,3,Tue Jul 21 20:46:46 2015 UTC,No Grienke?
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,lakehousebytheriver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:56 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit shocked to see Wacha at #15 and Arrieta at #14, and of course no Greinke.  Since my rankings are 100% fantasy related, what guys would move around?"
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,thenewblack8,-2,Tue Jul 21 20:49:25 2015 UTC,"I legitimately believe Wacha is going to be a stud for years to come. Being a Cards fan and watching what he did in 2013 playoffs puts no doubt in my mind.   I made this list off the top of my head, I knew I would forget someone. I'd slide Grienke right after Scherzer at #3. Everyone would move down 1 spot, and I'd bump Arrieta out of my top 15 and keep Wacha at 15 too.   Maybe I don't watch enough of Arrieta, but considering what he's done his whole career, that's why he isn't on my list. Nothing against the guy, I honestly just don't view him as a perineal ace."
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,mayormcchee5e,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:20:07 2015 UTC,-What are your thoughts on ERod blow up yesterday? anyy reason for concern?  -When is Paxon going to be back and will he have any value this year?  -Where do you think Cueto and Hamels end up? Im in an AL only league with #1 waiver priority and either would be a big boost to my team so long as they land in the AL.
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,pumpkinpower05,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:19:01 2015 UTC,"I talked about Erod a lot in today's SP Roundup - I led with him after all - and pretty much I feel that he'll recover and these are young blips as opposed to major trends we'll continue seeing.   The latest I have on Paxton is that he'll be returning in early-mid August.  I think he can be productive, but we may have to wait until the final week of August to feel comfortable with him in our lineup. Honestly, I have no idea.  So much can happen with trades, that I'll leave it to guys who actually have insider knowledge to make those predictions.  If I had to guess, Hamels to Dodgers, Cueto to Houston."

I think Carrasco will make it into the top 20 by the end of the year.   I'm intrigued by the Cole Hamels ranking. He and Lester are remarkably similar. Hamels does have the better K rate, Lester the better ERA. I'm intrigued to see how they both fare the rest of the way."
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,micahsw,2,Tue Jul 21 20:19:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks Lake!  I have a feeling Carrasco does too, but luck has been against him all year and it's hard not to get the impression that he can't run away from it at this point.  I know it's silly, but it makes me feel like I'm missing something in the numbers.  I often compare Hamels and Lester myself, and I was really thinking about lowering Hamels this week.  I figured I'd give him one more chance to redeem + see if he gets dealt by then."
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,Gunkwei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks, for the list. Great stuff as always. Do you have a guess at which pitchers will be probably shut down due to innings limit? And does that factor into your rankings?"
fantasybaseball,3e40ha,fawkesmulder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:34:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Glad you enjoy it.  The only guys I can think of that may be scrutinized come September would be Carlos Martinez, Lance McCullers, and Noah Syndergaard.  Considering that all three play for playoff contending teams, I would be shocked if their respective organizations would remove them completely to risk the giant payday of a playoff birth.  Thus, I don't factor innings limits into these rankings.  I think they are often speculation and rarely come into play, while you should mostly be focusing on performing well now and less about a month or two ahead."

fantasybaseball,3e40ha,fawkesmulder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:41:57 2015 UTC,Hey Guinness!  I think that's a stable deal and you should expect a Top 15 guy if not Top 10 SP the rest of the way.

fantasybaseball,3dzy0f,dibetta,5,Tue Jul 21 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Entire Boston defense is pitiful, and 2 of the hits he gave up were hard hits, a couple of bloops, two seeing-eye base hits"

fantasybaseball,3dzy0f,TheNaturalBrin,7,Mon Jul 20 22:02:32 2015 UTC,He did on the Pujols HR for sure. It was an offseed pitch and he dipped his head before he threw it. The Calhoun HR was just right over the heart of the plate and Kole killed it.
fantasybaseball,3dzy0f,fawkesmulder,3,Mon Jul 20 22:06:47 2015 UTC,He's obviously not this bad.  Don't need to be an optimist to see that

fantasybaseball,3dzy0f,Xellos42,7,Mon Jul 20 22:04:30 2015 UTC,Hanley is NOT an OF...... the Red Sox blew this when they thought Hanley could play the OF. When they signed Hanley I thought the best move would have been letting Mike Napoli walk or trade him and let Hanley play first
fantasybaseball,3dzy0f,spaceisinthemind,4,Mon Jul 20 22:19:10 2015 UTC,Agreed on both points. Hanley played it terribly and Eduardo still looked like crap. I'm at the game and was hoping to watch the kid pitch a gem. Oh well.

Cesar will probably be cut anyway when Rendon comes back off the DL so really that's no big loss for me. I'm trying to boost my saves (Currently only have Papelbon and Familia).

fantasybaseball,3e24wp,ch435,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:39 2015 UTC,What about Burns? Their peripherals are pretty similar but Aoki walks more and strikes out less and has a more realistic BABIP.

I feel like I should ask for a little more in return for Gio though since he's been pitching much better lately. Maybe Belt plus a mid to late round draft pick next year?"
fantasybaseball,3e24wp,mwm5062,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:10 2015 UTC,Yeah you should. Your sp is still good without him and belt has the ability to get really hot.
fantasybaseball,3e24wp,cstigall23,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:21 2015 UTC,Gio's peripherals look better than he's performing. I'd stick it out one or two more starts (but not longer) and see how he's doing.
fantasybaseball,3e24wp,ch435,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:07 2015 UTC,I'd feel pretty good about that since I feel like Gio is a pretty mediocre pitcher this year. If you can try to sell high on his latest successful starts then definitely push for that. A mid round draft pick plus Belt would be ideal.

fantasybaseball,3e24wp,CountChoculahh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:55:42 2015 UTC,"Hopefully that's not a keeper league. Redraft, I mean it's still bad but it could be worse."
fantasybaseball,3e24wp,mwm5062,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:12 2015 UTC,I need to drop either Ramos or Rosenthal as I have an excess of closers.  I think I want to give Rosenthal the benefit of the doubt going forward despite his recent woes.  Also just the fact that he is the Cardinal's closer is going to mean many more save opportunities.    Thoughts?
fantasybaseball,3e24wp,HunterSChronson,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:01 2015 UTC,Definitely trade one of them. Way too valuable to drop. Rosenthal is elite
fantasybaseball,3e24wp,chiefqueef1,3,Tue Jul 21 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"Who are your other closers? You can absolutely trade Ramos or Rosenthal, dropping them is insane."

fantasybaseball,3e24wp,kaleidoscope-eyed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:43 2015 UTC,Would he be used in your utility spot then? I like Kang right now. Overall I think he and Pillar are pretty similar but Kang is likely to regress a little (.341 BABIP). If it were me I'd probably drop Pillar for Kang.

fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,xmasjayons,10,Tue Jul 21 06:34:37 2015 UTC,"Before he started playing every day when Harrison went down, he was batting .277 in about 200 AB's as starter, masked by his career .250-something. Not a very good pinch hitter. In games where he started twice in a row or more, he was batting .298, and nearly all of his xbh and steals came during those stretches. I've mentioned this before, it seems like he finds a groove the more he plays and he's been pretty dominant lately, easily a top 10 SS if he keeps it up. Harrison and Mercer are both out for at least 6 weeks, with the way he's playing you could start him at 3rd if you're desperate."

fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,krimsonidol,2,Tue Jul 21 19:12:18 2015 UTC,"I think you did the right thing. Desmond had a HR yesterday but that's about it. I wouldn't call that ""heating up"" because he's hit isolated HR here and there all season. And while everyone says he's better in the 2nd half, I had him last year and he wasn't this bad during his 'bad' half so I'm not totally buying a turnaround this season.  Worst thing that happens is Desmond heats up after you drop him and hits like 15 HR in the 2nd half. I think Kang will have a better avg (and OBP if your league rolls like that) and may be able to put up 7 HR. Depending on your team's needs, you might not miss those [edit: math] 8 HR when compared with the headache of owning Desmond. And that's in a best-case scenario for Desmond.  Honestly I think if a guy is killing your team, and you can't trade him, then drop him and wipe your hands of it. Find another player (or stream players) to fill that void, and enjoy your team again regardless of how good that guy might be doing now that he's not on your team."
fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,dmendo54,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:51 2015 UTC,"I felt comfortable dropping Desmond bc I have Kang. Then Desmond hit a HR immediately obviously. I feel your pain as a Desmond owner, I don't think you made a bad move."

fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,painintheneck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:22 2015 UTC,Hell no
fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,IAMADeinonychusAMA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:46 2015 UTC,Is he good enough to trade Correa for an ace and then pick him up as replacement?
fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,MingLama45,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:22 2015 UTC,"yes, but you'd need an ace. Correa is looking like he might compete with Tulo for the number 1 SS spot ROS. Treat him like u would a healthy Tulo"
fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,canswim99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. I offered Correa for Felix straight up and he is thinking it over.

fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,canswim99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:21 2015 UTC,Kang or Escobar?

fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,bonerofalonelyheart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:57 2015 UTC,Escobar has been playing really well for me as of late. Currently have Seager stashed and waiting for the call up.

fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,royaljohnson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:59 2015 UTC,Usually you want a 1B or OF in that slot for the counting stats but if you have another options he's a plus for average and OBP with mediocre power and speed. There's definitely worse options.
fantasybaseball,3e1kjj,TCAR26,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:04 2015 UTC,Keep Crawford and turner over him?

fantasybaseball,3e0usv,micahsw,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I saw that too.  Glad he didn't have to go on the concussion DL or anything.

fantasybaseball,3e0usv,Thejordanmac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:05:05 2015 UTC,Does this mean he's back tomorrow or is it still Wednesday?
fantasybaseball,3e0usv,theAbstr4c7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:24:54 2015 UTC,It was originally announced he'd be back Wednesday and he often sits against lefties (Alex Wood vs. LAD tomorrow) so I wouldn't be surprised if he's out again.
