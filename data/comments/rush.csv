The band sounded amazing on it, and the lights really brought the song to life. My funny anecdote about this one was, when I was at the Tulsa show, Geddy started talking after Spirit Of Radio and he said ""This next one is off of Permanent Waves, it's one we've never done live before"". My immediate thought was ""How are they going to make Different Strings work live?"". Geddy said ""This one is called Jacob's Ladder"", and my immediate thought was ""Oh, they've done that before. Wait - OH MY GOD THEY'RE DOING JACOB'S LADDER!"" Distant Early Warning - My third slot really changed depending on which gig I'm talking about. I'll go with Distant Early Warning though because every gig I saw that they did it at, I was just amazed how good it sounded on this tour. I saw it on the Snakes & Arrows Tour and I don't remember it having the same energy it did on this tour. Plus at most of the shows, it was the first song to get the entire crowd going.

I don't like David because so many people claim he's better than Alex, based solely off of the solos from Comfortably Numb. He can't solo/improv in odd time signatures (even though he's a so-called ""prog-rock guitarist""). He takes the pretentiousness inherent in prog rock and takes it to a whole new level."

I think that while they probably did acid, they pretty quickly moved away from the harder drugs and didn't let it influence their music. They specifically mention marijuana in several interviews.  I think it'd be fun to look more in depth at Caress of Steel's lyrics sometime, but to me I've always interpreted the ""cask of 43"" line as referring to the age 43 or mayybe the year 43. Because the way I see it, that particular section of Fountain of Lamneth (Bacchus Plateau if I remember correctly?) is about aging, and the transition from middle-aged to old.  edit: I just read that it may also be referring to a specific brand of wine which is sometimes just called ""43"" because it has 43 ingredients."
rush,3dp6qm,bytor99,3,Sat Jul 18 03:34:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was actually made in 1938 and tested on a few animals, but Sandoz put up the research until Hofmann wanted to see if there was anymore potential for anything else in 1943.  The problem with interpreting Neil's lyrics is that almost anything rational is possible. Something like this does sound farfetched, but I'm not quick to dismiss."
rush,3dp6qm,Underscore_Talagan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:59:48 2015 UTC,I think cannabis influenced their music far far more. I wouldn't be surprised if they took LSD and it influenced certain themes. But insist think they were tripping acid regularly and writing music

rush,3dkduq,CheerBear2112,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:00:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it makes me feel really- oh, wait."

rush,3dkduq,Jag2112,2,Fri Jul 17 13:18:59 2015 UTC,"Don't discriminate. I may be different, but I'm a working man. At least, I guess that's what I am..."

rush,3dkigy,pcgfm,3,Fri Jul 17 00:29:09 2015 UTC,This is why Rush is the greatest band ever. They can both play and make amazing music while being hilarious and down to earth.
rush,3dkigy,jeffray123,3,Fri Jul 17 01:08:18 2015 UTC,I have a playlist of La Villa rants from that tour. Alex is a comedic genius!
rush,3dkigy,jshhmr,3,Fri Jul 17 03:12:36 2015 UTC,"Actually, those are the original lost lyrics at the the end, unfortunately they never made it on record, as they forgot to press record."
rush,3dkigy,mitchellaaro,3,Fri Jul 17 06:42:55 2015 UTC,"This is silly, i love it  edit: google brought up http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/main/VTtournews.htm"
rush,3dkigy,Telanstus,2,Fri Jul 17 13:20:03 2015 UTC,"Porto Alegre, Brazil. Alex began the rant with a really poor guitar solo and said ""That's how our next album will sound"". Then the next album had a Neil Young cover on it. Now that's attention to detail!"
rush,3dkigy,Dertrommlinator,2,Sun Jul 19 01:42:05 2015 UTC,"I was in the front row for that show at the ACC, right in front of Geddy. And Bubbles was there! That was before I knew who Bubbles was and I was wondering if it was really Alex's guitar tech."
rush,3dkigy,ScottFromCanada,2,Fri Jul 17 11:30:35 2015 UTC,He was Alex's guitar tech. Didn't you see the episode?
rush,3dlatz,rideaspiral,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:50:10 2015 UTC,Well I'm in eastern Washington but I'd love to go to see Rush at least once!
rush,3dlatz,allmachine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:39:15 2015 UTC,Distance is certainly not a disqualifier. I'm just thinking if for whatever reason I get a bunch of responses I may just opt to take the closest person. But let's see how things pan out. Expect follow up from me this weekend.
rush,3dlatz,allmachine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:45:19 2015 UTC,"Okay I won't be able to make the drive after all, but enjoy the show!"
rush,3dlatz,Gliese667,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:44:28 2015 UTC,"You might want to consider posting to /r/portland if you don't find a taker here - lots of people do that when they have event tickets they can't use, and people usually find takers. (I've already got my tickets for that show - section 118, woohoo! So I don't need one but someone might!) :)"
rush,3dlatz,Gliese667,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:37:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I might cross post, but would prefer finding someone in /r/rush if I can!"
rush,3dh5yn,might_be_a_troll,10,Thu Jul 16 06:09:50 2015 UTC,"From what I understood, they were dressing the stage to look like how it did during previous tours... a retrospective if you will. Like they were going back in time... much like how the songs went backwards in chronological order. The last few songs played had them in a high school gym... just like how they started."
rush,3dh5yn,Shawawa,4,Thu Jul 16 06:15:29 2015 UTC,Also note that they were DISASSEMBLING the Marshall stacks... going back in time!!!
rush,3dh5yn,Shawawa,6,Thu Jul 16 06:16:25 2015 UTC,I haven't seen them  but my guess is that they're dressing the stage -  what are they wearing ? Maybe meant to look like the men on the front of Moving Pictures?
rush,3dh5yn,armorandsword,3,Thu Jul 16 08:28:46 2015 UTC,Correct. The red jumpsuits were a nod to the Moving Pictures cover.
rush,3dh5yn,hooswj,5,Thu Jul 16 13:56:55 2015 UTC,"Yes they were going back in time with stage setup. The washing machines are definitely in rush in rio.   Something about how they stopped using speaker stacks and were plugging into the PA? but Alex kept his stack, I dunno, for the look? So geddy decided he wanted useless equipment behind him too.  The whole show went back in time; you might have noticed the modern light show switched to old school laser show as the music got older. For the encore it was a massive disco ball, even older school.   Edit: Alex gave up the decorative speaker stack eventually I guess. Hence why it started off as modern cool looking shit and then turned into s giant stack, and then the stack disappeared as the music got even older."
rush,3dh5yn,farnsw0rth,3,Thu Jul 16 07:01:00 2015 UTC,"Geddy went direct into the PA on Vapor Trails, and to fill the empty space he replaced his speakers with the three dryers. R30 he had two dryers and a vending machine, Snakes and Arrows he had three chicken roasters, and ever since Time Machine he's had the sausage, brain, popcorn, steampunk stuff.  Alex used his speakers up through the first leg of the Time Machine tour. He used Marshalls through the Test for Echo tour, then switched to Hughes and Kettner starting with Vapor Trails.   The Time Machine retro amps were fully functioning. Here's a video about them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urNih6vLAQc  He ran his guitar signal through those for the first leg of the Time Machine tour. After one too many incidents with the pyro during Far Cry (first in Helsinki in 2007, the ""Still No Guitar"" incident, and maybe a couple others), he switched to a direct feed into the PA for the second leg of the tour. Then on the Clockwork Angels tour, he ditched anything resembling speakers on stage."
