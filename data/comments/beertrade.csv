beertrade,3e2hpw,kyteflyer73,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:12 2015 UTC,Abraxas+ should be a relatively easy get for the BASS. I think the variants would require more ammo on your end.

beertrade,3e2hpw,stouts4everyone,3,Tue Jul 21 19:18:02 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume that it was 2014 framboos then. Was there a lot of head or no head? The 2011 framboos is a whole other beast.  Completely destroys 2014 framboos. way more funk, more carb, more fruit. and trades way higher. The theory is that in a couple years the '14 will be better because it will have time to carb up and develop. I'm sitting on a few bottles for that reason. And then if you get into the 99 framboos, well if you even see one of those ever you call me."

Broken truck trades are all over the place, it's gone for LPF in one trade and for BA abraxas in another. It's all over the place. I think the vintage 14 is what is hurting your offer.

beertrade,3e2hpw,martinimike82,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I may try again for the Broken Truck after I pick up the next NG R&D release in a couple of weeks. I have high hopes for that one, but we'll see.  I have considered tossing out 2 Fous for it, but not entirely convinced it's worth it yet. I could be wrong, but there's more ""established"" beers I think I'd rather trade 2 Fous for at this point. Things like BA Abraxas that have tons of ratings and is still regarded highly."
beertrade,3e2hpw,DJPho3nix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:25:35 2015 UTC,I think the next R&D is going to be a very sought after beer. It's the first fruited offering they've released this year. That plus it's Bourbon Barrel Aged - so it's going to get a lot of people stoked to try it. (For those that don't know - it's Bramble Berry Bourbon Barrel)
beertrade,3e2hpw,passepar2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:04 2015 UTC,I've been looking forward to it since I first heard rumors of it being a fruited bourbon barrel offering a few months ago. When I saw the official Bramble Berry Bourbon Barrel announcement I instantly made plans with some friends to go up again.
beertrade,3e2hpw,Chuck-17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"I agree.  With the bottle count of Velvet (and Broken Truck for that matter), the hype may not ever go down.  Hell look at VR.  Tons of bottles of that and it doesn't seem to go down at all."
beertrade,3e2hpw,passepar2,3,Tue Jul 21 17:58:41 2015 UTC,Vanilla Rye for Huna?  Is that even or where would the plus be?
beertrade,3e2hpw,martinimike82,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:22 2015 UTC,Agree with others.  Huna needs a plus.  It shouldn't but it does.
beertrade,3e2hpw,chsasvbeer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:16 2015 UTC,Would Huna + Vintage '14 be overkill?

beertrade,3e2hpw,Tunerstyle63,5,Tue Jul 21 18:24:29 2015 UTC,Huna adds but nothing huge maybe a zhukov or a another one of their solid semi limited offerings. People tend to forget that vanilla rye was upwards of 30K bottles.
beertrade,3e2hpw,HoryShetz,6,Tue Jul 21 17:12:07 2015 UTC,Huna need a plus.

VSS easily trades for Prop and Vanilla.  It can go for more, but let's just leave it at that. BAVSS once traded for Prop.  It's now taking a small + to land a Prop, but still pretty Prop adjacent.  So you're telling me 2xProp + Vanilla is off to Rare?  You're out of your mind, and it's why I don't trade much anymore.  Trading shouldn't be to screw people and there's no way trading should ever be more expensive than the secondary market.  No wonder people nowadays would just rather sell a few bottles and buy what they want.  Selling 2 Props would easily give you enough to buy a Rare, and it should (minus Venn diagram) be enough to trade for a Rare."
beertrade,3e2hpw,IggyWH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:52:06 2015 UTC,VSS easily trades for Prop and Vanilla.   The regular one?
beertrade,3e2hpw,FlopFaceFred,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:12 2015 UTC,"I'm confusing people and myself because many of us in a SD beer trading group have just decided to call Velvet VSS for now, because it's easy and no one cares about Viet SS currently."
beertrade,3e2hpw,IggyWH,4,Tue Jul 21 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"1) I live in SoCal.  2) If selling 2x prop can get you money to buy a rare, you should do it because you aren't gonna trade for it."
beertrade,3e2hpw,FlopFaceFred,2,Tue Jul 21 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"And that's why beer trading has gone to shit.  When the secondary market beats out the trade market, that's a sad and quite pathetic thing.  Just to be clear, I'm not talking about preference.  I can understand if someone with a Rare prefers keeping the Rare over trading it for 2 Prop.  Value wise though, if the guy was talking about Velvet and BA Viet, that is fair value for a Rare.  That is not off."
beertrade,3e2hpw,IggyWH,2,Tue Jul 21 18:14:10 2015 UTC,"You think value is all $$$ and not opportunity cost which is not true of markets at all. No one with Rare needs to trade one for Velvet + BAVSS when they could flip a vanilla + and get a BAVSS or likely pick it off for a 4 pack of BCBCS. That's just the hard truth on the ground. BAVSS may have traded for prop once or twice, but that is not it's going rate."
beertrade,3e2hpw,kyteflyer73,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:37 2015 UTC,"You act as though Velvet Speedway has no oppertunity cost though.  It's going to take a high end beer to land it.  In the case of my example, the BAVSS is just making up the difference.  It's a solid +.  That's why it's more than fair, but also understandable if someone with a Rare prefers to keep his Rare."
beertrade,3e2hpw,IggyWH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm completely missing something, I think there may be some confusion on my original post.

beertrade,3e2hpw,stouts4everyone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:58:23 2015 UTC,I think you could get a 375 for assassin+FO. But for the 750 you'll have to do the velvet. Or if you don't want to give up the velvet you can always do Assassin+Rare. The blabaer is only going to get harder to trade for and you always have to over trade stouts to get lambic.

beertrade,3e2hpw,FlopFaceFred,2,Tue Jul 21 18:06:01 2015 UTC,VBDL is established. That's what it comes down to. It's consistently one of the best stouts you can get. Include that with $50 price tag and you have to win the lottery to get it. Velvet might increase to it's level pretty soon once reviews start pouring in.
beertrade,3e2hpw,pastle,4,Tue Jul 21 17:24:01 2015 UTC,Agreed. That and the fact that people are setting the bar too high for newly released beers (I'm looking at you FO hoarders!) People need to try the beers or at least see more reviews before letting go proven whales.

They ""only"" release 700-1000 bottles each year so there's a limited supply and the people that really want it go overboard with their offers so the people that have it get an expectation of being able to land 6-10 desirable bottles with it. In my (possibly unpopular) opinion: keep the Velvet. Any Alesmith stout I've had is way way better than any Three Floyd's stout."

beertrade,3e4hz9,craigs119,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:21:51 2015 UTC,15per bottle at 3 per person.  Saw limited distribution and lasted in the tasting room for a couple days.  It's delicious.

beertrade,3e4hz9,Thirst_Trappist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:57:14 2015 UTC,I've got cow boss and the other release after it (2 regular Joe's imperial stout). I'll pm
beertrade,3e3xo7,daebat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:39:57 2015 UTC,Should be able to get FFF this weekend. How much are you looking for for the Terrapin?
beertrade,3e3xo7,ThriftyGarmola,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:09:41 2015 UTC,We can probably just do an even trade on a six pack of zombie dust. They're about the same price.
beertrade,3e3bq8,Henrythehippo,5,Tue Jul 21 17:11:29 2015 UTC,...and my inbox exploded. Closed
beertrade,3e3bq8,steve032,3,Tue Jul 21 17:23:55 2015 UTC,Lol yep. I wish I would have gotten here earlier.
beertrade,3e2rlb,allen413,3,Tue Jul 21 14:47:31 2015 UTC,I've contacted 3Floyds before about cap issues (though not due to rust). Maybe try sending them a message and see if you get a response. 3Floyd's contact info
beertrade,3e2rlb,CrzzyLegz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:50:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, I am actually in the process of composing my email to them.  This is the first bad encounter I have had with them and feel bad because I really wanted to add these as extras as they are delicious."
beertrade,3e2rlb,g3ckoNJ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:36 2015 UTC,I've had infected bottle with rust on them. ( not 3 floyds) If that rust isn't making contact with the part that's capping the beer I wouldn't think it would be as big of an issue. My rust was under each cap. I'd open one if you have a few to see if it gushes or tastes off.
beertrade,3e2rlb,fungoid_sorceror,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:13 2015 UTC,"Looks like moisture from sitting in a cooler.  They're probably fine, pop one and see what the inside of the cap looks like."
beertrade,3e2rlb,jburley2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:09 2015 UTC,That would make sense had they been in a cooler.
beertrade,3e2cdg,RyanMcFly1985,4,Tue Jul 21 12:32:46 2015 UTC,This is done!
beertrade,3e38iv,brenduuune,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:01 2015 UTC,Anything from VA you would be interested in? I had a captains daughter last week and was blown away

beertrade,3e2rie,chewie23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:08 2015 UTC,PM'd. I'm actually looking to do the same thing!
beertrade,3e2rie,HopAnonymous,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:14 2015 UTC,Last time I was there you were not able to buy the green bottles to take home.  They would only open a green bottle and pour it for you in the brewery.  I can check on that this weekend when I head over there.
beertrade,3e3xad,colinwehrle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:37:25 2015 UTC,Only interested in this year's?  I have all 6 from last year.
beertrade,3e3xad,hefehead12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:24:34 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind this year or last years to be honest
