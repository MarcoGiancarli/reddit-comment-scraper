Windows10,3e1zrf,Padfoot240,2,Tue Jul 21 14:33:22 2015 UTC,GIFs shouldn't interrupt songs playing on the phone version. Really bugs me how gfycat GIFs do that on Readit.
Windows10,3e1zrf,b33j,3,Tue Jul 21 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"That's not really the fault of the app. Gfycat plays GIFs as HTML5, which can carry audio. It's likely that Gfycat includes an audio stream with every image, regardless of whether or not there is any audio with the image. Windows phone only allows one audio stream at a time, so it assumes that the most recently opened one is the one you want to hear. Since there is an audio stream of silence with Gfycat, you get music cut out.  It might be possible to suppress the audio stream, but it's probably a much more complex bit of programming to play and suppress audio rather than just play it."

Windows10,3e0tni,jravn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:41:00 2015 UTC,I just came from that. I loved all of its features but the basics of it was broken for me. It refused to open folders through an external source like qbittorrent or even the start menu. Only way it would work is if I have an instance of windows explorer already open. I looked through all the settings and enabled windows capture but none of it worked. Therefore I went back to Clover for its simplicity and its way more reliable for me. Rarely have Clover crash on me.

Windows10,3e0tni,SlendyTheMan,2,Tue Jul 21 08:19:47 2015 UTC,If a program gives me an option to choose where it installs I do it. Its not because of OS failure as reinstalling OS messes with programs as well. Its just for organization. Both partitions are in my SSD.

Windows10,3e0tni,lolmastergeneral,4,Tue Jul 21 06:36:42 2015 UTC,this is a VERY GOOD IDEA.....please Microsoft DO IT!    I want tabs
Windows10,3e0tni,Swaggy_McSwagSwag,3,Tue Jul 21 03:09:37 2015 UTC,I think they're working on a complete rewrite of Explorer for Redstone. It's gonna be a store app and probably use tabs.
Windows10,3e0tni,KashEsq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:57:05 2015 UTC,I really don't want the metro UI for the app honestly.

Windows10,3e2k2v,oldage,8,Tue Jul 21 13:46:04 2015 UTC,"The modern (Metro) version of Skype was killed off in favour of the desktop version. Why that's not built-in, I'm not entirely sure."
Windows10,3e2k2v,TLM_A,3,Tue Jul 21 13:55:10 2015 UTC,"That odd MS behavior, they seem to be pushing for metro apps yet they kill their own version of their own software I don't know what to think."

Windows10,3e2k2v,Nekzar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:53 2015 UTC,"They are only gonna build in some of the core functionality. Basically anything and maybe more you could with Metro app, so that's why that app is now redundant.  But they won't reach the levels of the skype desktop app, so that's why that's still available if you want all the skype functionality in one place.  ""built-in"" means the features are present in other Microsoft apps, like Messaging. And I'm going to assume that you'll be signed into ""skype"" when you sign into Windows."
Windows10,3e2k2v,Magicthize,7,Tue Jul 21 20:05:00 2015 UTC,It is going to be built in as part of the universal messaging/video/calling apps but it's not going to be ready for launch.  http://www.winbeta.org/news/no-plans-single-universal-skype-app-windows-10-microsoft-will-offer-skype-built-apps-instead  Frankly I think it's a dumb decision to turn off the app before the feature was ready to take over as it has clearly caused alot of confusion. If there's a good reason for it they could have at least given us an explanation.
Windows10,3e2k2v,Wolf_CZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly, instead of soon(tm).  Atleast there is that skype translation app for me, as for tablet its definitely better than desktop app."
Windows10,3e2k2v,jhoff80,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:11 2015 UTC,Especially dumb in my opinion when you consider that the desktop version doesn't work with Action Center.
Windows10,3e2k2v,jazza_uk,4,Tue Jul 21 18:52:37 2015 UTC,"Microsoft will be releasing a Messaging app, after the release of Windows 10, which will include Skype support. How long after, is anyones guess.   http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/22/7871919/skype-for-windows-10-features"
Windows10,3e2k2v,Rubnik,2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:48 2015 UTC,"I believe I saw a post a few weeks ago, that they were gonna discontinue the app, and only  have the desktop version. Tbh, I was surprised there was still the metro app in the previous builds"
Windows10,3e2k2v,3DXYZ,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:40 2015 UTC,I thought so. Theres screenshots of it on blog.skype but we see no evidence of it anywhere. I hope the desktop skype gets updated for a windows 10 look. I'd rather it look modern and have a better ui for touch. Right now I cant even exit skype for desktop without killing the process :( Skype should become the standard IM/voice communication platform for windows as its far better than google hangouts which I would like to get rid of. Skypes biggest problem is Microsofts lack of full initiative to make it the best IM/voice app out there. I hope they have something up their sleeves coming out at the end of the month for skype desktop because it needs an update badly.
Windows10,3e2k2v,TLM_A,2,Tue Jul 21 14:10:13 2015 UTC,"Right now I cant even exit skype for desktop without killing the process   What? Why? All you need to do is right-click the Skype icon in the taskbar (or longpress it) and choose ""Quit Skype"". The tray icon works as well."
Windows10,3e2k2v,3DXYZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:20 2015 UTC,I know. Doesn't work.
Windows10,3e2k2v,DrShibeHealer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:53:40 2015 UTC,"Skype should become the standard IM/voice communication platform for windows   You say that now, but as soon as you start joining small skype communities you will have to have one user use some extremely outdated version of skype just to add all the people you need, and then as soon as you start a voice call every user in the call will crash or expirience extreme lag. Old skype was good, new skype useless when it comes to group chats. Hell, even just having a few hundred active contacts tends to make the new mobile friendly client crash every time you log on. Imo Microsoft ruined it."
Windows10,3e2k2v,kinyutaka,3,Tue Jul 21 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the less bloatware, the better.  Since I don't use Skype, I won't miss it not being built in, and if I want to get it, I can download it."

It wasn't much of a theory though, because I have been running a clean Windows 10 install on my laptop ever since the 10240 build came out. All I did was upgrade from Windows 8.1 to build 10240, and then clean install after that. No product keys or anything."
Windows10,3e3stk,tangelopomelo,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:12 2015 UTC,Not unusual. It seems MS has a lot of bugs to sort out before the 29th.
Windows10,3e3stk,snaut,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"Search has been a hit and miss mess for me for the past two versions.  I hear that creating a new profile works for some people.  For me, killing off  the Cortana process (sometimes it takes multiple tries) works.  I'm really tempted to just do a ""fresh"" install of 10 come the 29th to see if that fixes it.  It couldn't hurt seeing as how I've gone from 7 to 8 to 8.1 and now to 10.  I'm sure it's due for a clean start."

Try Disabling ULPS.  Might want to try Windows Update or 3d party application like DDU [Display Driver Uninstaller].

While you're at it, if at all possible I would go ahead and unplug that hard drive from your system until after Windows 10 is finished installing.
