The whole poem can be read here but the section the phrase comes from is the refrain, which goes:   Come to the sunset tree! The day is past and gone, The woodsman's axe lies free, And the reaper's work is done!"

A dysfunctional household depicted by describing specific items of clutter, things that need fixing or maintaining and finally an expression of the speakers emotions."
themountaingoats,3dueqs,Face_Roll,14,Sun Jul 19 16:10:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I was thinking as well. Also, you know a song is powerful when the line ""half-eaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer"" makes you tear up."
themountaingoats,3dueqs,angelfromthecoast,13,Sun Jul 19 17:17:55 2015 UTC,"I think most of these items are evidence of the dysfunctional home---the clutter (1, 2, 7), the disorganization (3, 8, 9), but also the personal situation (the teachers and friends who mean well, but don't understand his situation and aren't actually helping; and the morbid notebook).  The two I'm not so sure about are the new straw and the fresh fuel.  New straw for an old broom might be about poverty---so poor you have to restraw a broom rather than just buying a new one.  I'm at a loss on the sodium flare."
themountaingoats,3dueqs,elseifian,7,Sun Jul 19 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"I think the flare is acting as a metaphor, all these items should be a warning sign to the other people in his life like teachers/friends and they fuel the flare that he 'shoots' hoping that someone sees it and can help him out of his broken home."
themountaingoats,3dueqs,SexualPunchline,5,Sun Jul 19 16:34:49 2015 UTC,"The new straw, I would put in the ""clutter"" category.   Yes, they have the new straw, but by the description, it seems it's just sitting around waiting to be put into the old broom. So right now it's just more clutter."
themountaingoats,3dueqs,unaspirateur,3,Sun Jul 19 16:27:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, I hadn't thought of that.  That makes a lot of sense.  And having a household where someone got around to buying the new straw, but then it just sits around being clutter because no one puts it in the broom matches the image of people repeatedly buying gallons of ice cream which get eaten for a while, and then abandoned in the freezer."
themountaingoats,3dueqs,elseifian,2,Sun Jul 19 16:38:03 2015 UTC,"""New straw for the old broom"" could be an extended metaphor with the title- both the broom and the people who live in the house are ragged and torn apart, with no one bothering to even try to piece them back together."

themountaingoats,3dueqs,CatMadeOfFur,3,Sun Jul 19 17:43:23 2015 UTC,"Sodium lights are for outdoors, hunting and stuff.   It's all just the random shit that accumulates in a broken household.

themountaingoats,3dueqs,fff8e7cosmic,2,Mon Jul 20 04:54:13 2015 UTC,"I thought it was just a list of items in the house to set the scene. He does that kind of exposition pretty often, this just being more of a stream of consciousness than his usual way of establishing setting. It makes sense for the second track on the album to be mostly a vivid description of the environment of the household -- Broom People being the first ""chapter"" of TST, You Or Your Memory being the prologue."
themountaingoats,3dueqs,alecksmugino,2,Mon Jul 20 16:30:45 2015 UTC,"I took this list as just him trying to paint a picture.  (Specificity is the soul of narrative).    I had just assumed that a sodium flare was some kind of lantern I'd never heard of.  Interestingly there are more Google results about the Mountain Goats than any specific thing.  This http://www.glassfacts.info/indexf1d0.html?fid=208 says that sodium flare happens when you're blowing glass, and there are special glasses to filter it out.  I'm guessing John had heard the word ""sodium flare"" and didn't remember what it really was."
themountaingoats,3dueqs,jfstepha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:12:10 2015 UTC,"I always read it more as being the dysfunction of the chaotic teen mind. The juxtaposition of being a child and becoming an adult in an already difficult situation and trying to fix things the old way and sometimes the things that make you feel better when you're young don't work anymore which is how I read the ""new straw for the old broom"" line and then juxtapose that against budding sexuality which at that age really does make everything feel better ""In your arms I am a wild creature""   The second verse brings the chaos and dysfunction to a more (inwardly) aggressive level with the notebook which kind of crescendos with emotionally breaking down to the same person (to me the line ""in the long tresses of your hair I am a babbling brook."" reads like the protagonist is holding his lover and sobbing, though I imagine it could also be a reference to sexuality."
themountaingoats,3dw5ov,i_ate_the_chair,7,Mon Jul 20 01:04:07 2015 UTC,"JD seems to prefer playing all-ages shows. Some venues simply refuse to do it, so at times he plays age-restricted venues. It's not the artist's choice most of the time - it's all about venue policy. If you go to the venue website for the show you're interested in, it will say if there's an age restriction on the show. And if it doesn't, there will be contact info for you to reach out directly and check."
themountaingoats,3dw5ov,Dashtego,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:26:51 2015 UTC,"I know that in StL minors need an adult to accompany them, although I was able to talk the venue into letting a 19 year-old bring a 17 year-old."

themountaingoats,3dw5ov,Dashtego,3,Mon Jul 20 04:55:32 2015 UTC,"I would bet that the Lawrence Arts Center is all ages. You usually only run into age issues when venues sell liquor/double as bars and have to contend with the various licensing and insurance issues that go along with that, and the implications that has for who they can let in. The Lawrence venue, on the other hand, looks like a non-profit theater/gallery that has like kids ballet recitals and stuff. You should contact them to double check, but it's almost certainly an all ages show."

DIY for yourself, g'wan witcha bad self. DIY for selling to others, even if what's at root is love of the band, no, I ain't down with that. Not even if you're offering to send me a cut or anything. I won't be sending lawyers after anybody but I'm just telling you how I feel; it's flattering to know people are making something to wear themselves, but I'm the only guy who has any right to be selling MG stuff - me, or the people I personally delegate to do it i.e. labels/distros.

I'm not kidding, I'm just expressing an opinion and pointing out that this kind of thing has been discussed before and that John's said he would prefer that people not make products that reference his work and put them up for sale (as opposed to gifts). This person has mass produced an item for sale that hasn't been endorsed by the artist and isn't benefiting them in any way.  If you want to be technical and suppose that the IP is owned by whoever designed it at 4AD, do you think they're getting anything from it?

People LOVE This Year (which I don't play too often but I will whip it out if I need something anthemic) and Dance Music (which I do whenever I need to play something fun sounding). The Mountain Goats have so many fun, high energy songs like Weekend In Western Illinois and Golden Boy, you need to be playing those."

Tallahassee was not something I would have though, but that is something I will have to play around with. Sunset tree is on my extended list to grow into for sure.  I was looking at a bit off of full force galesburg, ghana, and protein source of the future. From there work back form their new stuff.

EDIT: I should say I think people misinterpreted (as I did) the part of that video I linked to, where he talks about a song being about a friend who hung himself and then talks about people screaming out ""Golden Boy"" at concerts.

themountaingoats,3da3ja,logarythm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:47:09 2015 UTC,"Iirc, some people see Going to Georgia as misogynistic. I don't really share the view, but it is a song about angsty young men and I am the king of youth and angst."
themountaingoats,3da3ja,Haberdashery2000,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:27:55 2015 UTC,"It's a specific kind of misogyny, the kind that glorifies an unhealthy ideal of masculinity. A character like the one in Going to Georgia is rash and violent, and channels those feelings into impressing a girl; the tone and the lyrics suggest this behavior is utterly romantic.   Every single man and boy can agree that they've probably had a fantasy similar to this when they were young and (as you say) angsty, but it's not something you should actually want to commit, let alone hold up as a romantic ideal. It's not the content of the song's story that is by itself toxic, it's the way it's portrayed and rewarded.  Still, you can't fuck with the line ""The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you and that you're standing in the doorway,"" and I still yearn to scream along with it at a live show. He should write a completely different song that naturally incorporates the same exact line. Maybe."
themountaingoats,3da3ja,logarythm,4,Thu Jul 16 00:42:09 2015 UTC,"and channels those feelings into impressing a girl;   but where does the song state it's a man singing about a woman? unless there's a line I dont remember (a very likely possibility tbqh). I'll agree though the song doesn't exactly espouse good social behavior.   I think, too, that I had a different impression of the song than others. I always thought the singer was going to georgia to be free of this person, and the gun is to kill themselves. The person standing in the doorway is at your doorway, as your about to blast your brains in a sleezy motel room. the song is about momentary redemption, though the problems that sent you to georgia in the first place remain unresolved, so its kinda tragic in that way too."
themountaingoats,3da3ja,Haberdashery2000,2,Thu Jul 16 05:18:58 2015 UTC,"You're right, I think I was projecting gender into that. But I don't think that changes anything about the message, in my interpretation (and author intention) -- like I said, the root of its misogyny lies in its portrayal of masculinity.   Your interpretation is interesting though, and does cast it in a different light, though one that plays against tone. I find it iffy in a different way though, as it would seem to glorify a suicidal threat in the same way (Threaten to kill yourself -> beautiful person of unstated gender will forgive and save you -> Not a very healthy relationship either). But that's just my interpretation of your interpretation!"
themountaingoats,3da3ja,getmoney7356,2,Thu Jul 16 05:42:52 2015 UTC,"I never even considered the suicidal threat angle until John explained it in detail.  I always thought it was a young man running from the law or criminals (hence the gun, going to the middle of nowhere) and then when he finally saw his significant other where he told her to meet him, he forgot his worries (she slides the gun from his hand) and realizes everything is going to be OK.  Kinda a love conquers all type message."
themountaingoats,3da3ja,PiTheKhoz,2,Thu Jul 16 07:57:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on pretty much every point. First of all, I imagined the 'you' in Going to Georgia as being a guy, as well as the narrator. Because I did that, I was super confused when people said it was about misogyny. It makes sense, I suppose, but I don't think that it HAS to be interpreted like that.  I've thought about it and considered both what you said and the suicide angle. And I've come to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter which it is. The fact that the speaker is going to do something dangerous and reckless with a gun, no matter what it is, is what the 'you' in the song saves them from. Maybe they're gonna rob a liquor store, maybe they're gonna kill someone they blame for their problems, or maybe they're going to kill themselves. I do think the song is about a person who is broken, and I don't think WE should forgive them, but I do think that we should find it remarkable that someone loves them so much to forgive them."
themountaingoats,3da3ja,PiTheKhoz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:06:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be a little speculators here, so someone tell me if I've crossed any lines or anything. I really don't mean to, I'm just offering my idea of an answer.  Going with the 'suicidal' angle, I disagree that this song glorifies it at all. I think that it glorifies the idea that love can save you from the most desperate places. I think we hear the speaker has a gun and is reckless, and we're like ""Oh shit, that's not good."" But because someone came to help him, he was able to stop. I dunno, I just disagree with the idea that it's part of an unhealthy relationship for someone to help someone overcome suicidal thoughts. I know this is a super sensitive subject, and I've never had depression, so forgive me. It just seems that, in the event you are so sad etc., you might want someone who loves you so much that it can bring you back from the edge, as it were.  Again, I really don't want to hurt anyone with the post, so someone please tell me if I'm wrong or misunderstanding anything.

themountaingoats,3d1qtr,skiingperson1,3,Mon Jul 13 05:09:53 2015 UTC,"I've never read any of John Green's books. I'm going to say something and it's like ""Yeah, dude, why would you consider yourself a TMG fan?"", but a good portion of TMG songs, especially earlier ones, follow clichés of bad writing. They often work as songs but would be painful to hear at a reading. Compared to what bad writers most lyricists are, JD was on a different level from the start, but if those songs had been short stories, a good portion would have been cringey. I think of much of TMG like Arthur Russell, though, where there's just this preservation of productivity and that guarantees that a lot of it is somewhere between meh and cringey, but you gotta sit through that to get gems. Perfect example: Black Molly. Love the opening line, ""Black mollies in the aquarium, darted back and forth as through an earthquake were certain."" Then it gets corny in the way Going to Georgia is corny — very Guy in Your MFA corny. That song was written a long time ago, though, and WIWV is really an incredible book. It's also a sign of JD's maturity as a writer and person in general."

themountaingoats,3cyh90,angelfromthecoast,8,Sun Jul 12 02:05:39 2015 UTC,"This will be a reply chain to myself for a moment: clears throat  ""There is a second group of gold leaves which were found exclusively in two extraordinary grave mounts in Thurioi in southern Italy; they date to the fourth century BC. In one of them several people, who had probably died by lightning, had been buried successively; death by heavenly fire seemed to announce an extraordinary status in the afterworld. In the texts from this grave the dead man proclaims: 'I come pure from the pure, queen of the chthonic, Eukles, Eubuleus and you other immortal gods; for I am proud to be myself also of your blessed race.'Two texts add: 'I have paid penance for works not just,' while the third adds some especially imaginative verses: 'I flew away from the circle of heavy grief and pains. I stepped with swift feet on the longed-for wreath. I dived beneath the lap of the mistress, the chthonic queen.' There follows a blessing with the unprecedented claim: 'Happy and blessed one, god will you be instead of a mortal;' then an enigmatic conclusion: 'Kid I fell in the milk.' A similar texts comes from the larger grave mound in which a single man was buried, to whom ritual worship was paid: 'Be glad that you have suffered what you never suffered before. A god you have become from a man. Kid you fell in the milk.' The proclamation of beatitude, the suffering, and the code word of the kid most probably refer to some initiation ritual; Persephone, queen of the dead, plays a special role in these mysteries. The rest remains obscure: does the kid who fell in the milk point to a proverb or an initiation sacrifice? Does the lap of the goddess hint at a ritual of rebirth? With the promise of apotheosis these texts go beyond everything else that is known from Greek mysteries of the Classical Age. The order of what is sett down and apportioned, Themis and Moira, seems to dissolve. Here indeed mysteries infringe upon the system of traditional Greek religion. Yet this seems to have remained an isolated case for a long time.""  Transcribed for your reading pleasure from Burkert's and Raffan's ""Greek Religion""  as per the directions here"
themountaingoats,3cyh90,Centrisian,3,Sun Jul 12 01:50:26 2015 UTC,This is a paper on the milk representing immortality.  It covers four tablets that all have some variation of this theme on them.

The band stopped playing and told her that I was with them, and doing work for them lol. The drinks were nice too.   good times."

It started as me just wanting to find the best quality available by waiting and finding out who had what. People started realizing that I always found the best of the best. Then I worked out a proposal for the dealers, the general spiel was ""You don't need everyone knowing who you are, I'll handle the leg work and strangers and you just cut me in"" That and I can haggle like a king!

I am getting the special edition beat the champ {I have to order this online} and sun set tree next week. I think I have to just suck it up and get get lonely online as well.

I would wet myself if someone ever started putting out new vinyls for Sweden or the YoYo EPs though. With the medium in a growing bubble and reissues being pretty much everywhere, I wouldn't put the chances at nil (though they're still pretty small - it seems like AHWT was the only one pressed again because Merge picked up on the rights for its anniversary, and it was already the most popular and visible lo-fi recording)."

Misunderstood Metal Fans vs. Mistreated Altar Boys. At the end of the day, one of these songs will be eternally chewing the other in its mouth. Which will it be?  Denton?   By far the favorite. It's been the most encore'd and double-encore'd tMG song in live sets for eons, critically analyzed in national literary journals like The Believer, and serves as a rallying cry for hundreds of thousands of fans the world over. The underdog's underdog song is actually the vast overdog in this spot. Both songs qualified today beat their previous opponents in decisive triple-digit wins, but Denton had a 150 point total while Judas was edging 120. That, alone, speaks to the fervor Denton arouses in its diehards.   Judas?   You can argue this is a qualitatively better song, and you certainly won't be alone in that regard. But only a grassroots effort pulling these like minds out of silence can stop the Denton juggernaut.   My Vote?  Judas. Denton is the ultimate singalong, but damn you can DANCE to Judas.

Toppling ""Cry For Judas"" is no easy feat, but as I said in the previous .5 round, if anyone can do it, it's gonna be ""Cubs."" As someone-who-I-can't-be-bothered-to-namecheck-from-my-history mentioned last week, its bittersweet heart is bandaged deep within a practically oozing goofiness, the perfect recipe for a Mountain Goats Song Archetype 2. However, ""Cry For Judas"" is the perfect specimen of Archetypes 1 and 3: the survival song, and the complicated exploration of religion song. Plus, it can pump a fucking fist. The horns! The horns! Some more formal analysis would show ""Judas"" to have the edge here, as it more easily pulled triple-digits and had fewer close shaves, even against Tier 1 songs like ""Amy,"" ""Chavo"" and ""Sax."" This analysis is skewed by generally lighter voting patterns in the Uncreleased aisle, plus the fact that ""Judas"" pretty much only faced songs named after people. ""Cubs in Five"" aint named after no one. There's a good chance that we'll be seeing the same ""Cubs"" that struck down ""Ox Baker"" in a 30 point spread come out tonight. Betting Line:   Cry For Judas (3:1) vs. Cubs in Five (5:1)   Coming off the upset of the day, the upset of the week, the upset of the month, and the upset of the year, ""Weekend in Western Illinois"" is poised to unseat ""Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton"" for the upset of the century. Now, I don't wanna punish ""Weekend"" fans for dreaming their dreams, but I don't expect this to happen, but that this point, all bets are off.

Comparative strength in the final bracket: Despite the mammoth cleanup job it did in the rounds leading up to this moment, I would seed it in the bottom half of the final four. It finds a lo-fi match in The Best Ever Death Metal Band, and despite its unpredictable rise, still had an easier course to clear than Cry for Judas.   Mid-Fi: No alarms and no surprises. Best Ever Death Metal Band burns brighter than ever, gently walking on the heads of the opposition into its Learjet.   Comparative strength: The song to beat. Who else could pull off a 40 point spread on No Children?   Hi-Fi: Just stay alive! Just kidding! Amy's gone, and Judas put the knife in her back with another narrow victory.   Comparative strength: It may be premature, given we don't know who will emerge from the Unreleased bracket, but I think Judas has got good odds to at least make it into the finals. I've underestimated it so far all tournament, and unless it's faced immediately with Best Ever Death Metal Band (I'm gettin real sick of typing that whole name), it's in good shape to take down any of the other 3 boombox recordings it can potentially spar with.   Unreleased: And now the match at hand! The overdogs since day one, Cubs in Five takes it all the way to January against You Were Cool. Once again, it's John's sentimental side against straight-up goof, and the bleeding heart in me says that the more nuanced portrayal of one of life's underdogs gives You Were Cool an edge. Plus, Cubs in Five beat Store AND Ox Baker Triumphant. So fuck that song.   Comparative Strength: On the other hand, I actually think Cubs would fare better in the semis. Making the Death Metal Band exception, I think it's an even match against Judas and outstrums Weekend in Western Illinois."

themountaingoats,3bvywf,bashothebanana,6,Thu Jul 2 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it sounds like the narrator has gone legitimately insane. I mean the first lyrics are ""I'm coming in, try to stop me. Push furniture in front of the door, it only gives me something to push against"". The narrator is essentially breaking and entering into someone's home, who is telling him to  ""go away"" and then hides. There probably is no eight thousand dollars, though the narrator was almost certainly drinking when it came into his mind. His obsession for this girl manifests itself in a fabricated loan, giving him some sort of ""reason"" to pursue her. At the end, then, when John laughs like a madman, it's the babbling of a person driven insane through love and alcohol and whatever else. At least, that's my interpretation!   EDIT: Just realised this song is part of the Alpha series, so there may have been an actual eight thousand dollars, but I don't really listen to the Alpha songs as a complete story so I think my interpretation retains some validity :)"

You wouldn't convince me that was a semifinals game, won by a friggin 33 seed, even if you showed me. But damn, it happened, and Weekend in Western Illinois is now out to prove that there will be There Will Be No Divorce in the grand semifinals.  Predicted Champion: Weekend in Western Illinois cannot be stopped. There Will Be No Divorce was a strong favorite from the start, and its narrow-as-narrow-gets win over Elijah proved it could hold its own against any power player, but Weekend is too much of a wild card to make any foregone conclusions. A betting man sticks with the hot streak. I love There Will Be No Divorce, I might even love it even more than any song left in all the brackets, but Weekend gets the edge. Cinderella gotta get paid. Betting Line:   Weekend in Western Illinois (2:1) vs. There Will Be No Divorce (4:1)  No Children and Best Ever Death Metal Band Region:   Because was it really ever going to be anything else? The Father and Holy Ghost of the Holy Trinity of Mountain Goats songs finally come face to face, with Best Ever Death Metal Band given a slight edge. Everyone knows all the words to No Children, and no doubt hundreds of us want Death Metal Band to drown with no sign of land, but you only need to know two words to be on Team Denton: Hail Satan! Predicted Champion: The People's Champion, Da Best Eva Death Metal Band Outta Denton. No Children is a technical marvel, and gets points for making more critics' lists than any other TMG song, but you cannot deny the raw power of 1200 people chanting for Lucifer's love in unison. Hail Satan, indeed, Hail Satan all the way to the semifinals. Betting Line:   Best Ever Death Metal Band (1:2) vs. No Children (3:1)  Hi-Fi Region:   Once again, solid victories by two of the most highly regarded songs of the post-Heretic Pride studio era. And so much for Heretic Pride, right? Amy and Judas struck down their strongest champions without much effort, laying nearly identical 40-point smackdowns. But it's time for Transcendental Youth's dominance to stop being polite and start getting real: it's either Amy or Judas from this point on. And folks, this might just be too painful to call. Predicted Champion: Amy by a slim margin. Past history in the tournament would tell us that Judas might be a safer bet, and indeed it's also a richer composition musically and lyrically, but Amy plays the Hail Satan card in full force: you can't not sing along to ""STAY ALIVE! JUST STAY ALIVE!"" It's the clearest representation of one of John Darnielle's most prominent thematic throughlines, and it's one hell of a crowdpleaser to boot. Betting Line:   Amy AKA Spent Gladiator 1 (2:1) vs. Cry for Judas (3:1)  Unreleased Region:   Lagging a little behind once more, it's come down to four songs in the unreleased region. And once again, the larger field means more diversity in this final four: we're got Ox Baker representing the studio singles and EPs, You Were Cool holding it down for live staples, Cubs in Five repping lo-fi EPs, and Going to Alaska coming in from prehistory cassettes. Unfortunately, oddswise, everything still swings heavily in favor of golden boys You Were Cool and Cubs in Five. Still, it's now established that Ox Baker has no qualms with taking down such golden boys, and Going to Alaska's rise to prominence nearly rivals Weekend in Western Illinois's. I can't quite call it anyone's game, but it'll be not wholly unexpected to see a couple upsets come the fourth of July. Predicted Upset: This past round, the Unreleased region was home to four stunning buzzerbeaters, without a single match clearing a 20-point spread (and besides the Going To showdown, none clearing 10 points).

themountaingoats,3bnow2,FreeAsCheap,15,Tue Jun 30 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"Lo-fi Region:   Weekend in Western Illinois tears it up with no sign of stopping, positively beheading Grendel's Mother with a three-point victory. On the other edge of the bracket, slight-underdog Elijah proves that you should have saved a spot for it at the table by trouncing Baboon. It was a round of unexpected victories that has considerably shifted the odds going forward. There Will Be No Divorce still stands as region favorite, especially following a decisive victory over Minnesota, but the lone survivor of Full Force Galesburg is now primed to give The Alphonse Mambo a serious run for its money. Potential Upsets: Weekend in Western Illinois vs. The Alphonse Mambo. Is Weekend going to be the George Mason circa 2006 of lo-fi Mountain Goats recordings and pierce the regional finals? Time will tell (two days, specifically). Match to Watch: Elijah vs. There Will Be No Divorce. The strongest performers from The Coroner's Gambit finally face off. It's like picking your favorite kid, damnit. Betting line: Because I realized I'm pretty underqualified to guess spreads, I'm going with straight-up ratio odds going forward.   33 Weekend in Western Illinois (5:1) vs #12 The Alphonse Mambo (7:2)  15 Elijah (4:1) vs #11 There Will Be No Divorce (3:2)  Mid-fi Region:   And it comes to the final-est final four this tournament will ever see, four of the favorite-est favorites to ever grace the tournament. And what's even more surprising? This Year ain't one of 'em. That's right, Up the Wolves pulled through with the upset, and killed all the judges who judged it not fit to proceed. It now faces the one matchup that could possibly run tougher in Best Ever Death Metal Band. Could it pull off a miracle two rounds in a row and send Cyrus and Jeff packing all the way back to Denton? Your votes decide! Potential Upsets: Up the Wolves vs. Death Metal Band. Match to Watch: No Children vs. Dance Music. Two mammoth cuts from two equally acclaimed records, both of them pulling equally impressive victory spreads all tournament. It's a wash, folks. Betting line:   8 Up the Wolves (8:1) vs #5 The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton (2:3)  2 No Children (2:1) vs #3 Dance Music (3:1)  Hi-fi Region:   Four songs left. An even split between Heretic Pride and Transcendental Youth. Will the finals be dominated by one album, or continue the even split with one of each? Amy AKA Spent Gladiator has done more than just stay alive this tournament, but will Heretic Pride be its ultimate reckoning? Cry For Judas is still here, leaving all others lost in its wake, but will Sax Rohmer finally send it home with its own blood in its mouth? Truthfully, I don't know at all. This region is tight tight tight. Potential Upsets: Cry for Judas vs. Sax Rohmer #1 is as close as matchups come but, again, would be an upset in name only. Of the two remaining Heretic Pride, I'd say Sax has the better chance of making it into the finals. Match to Watch: Cry for Judas vs. Sax Rohmer #1 -- then again, I'd also say Judas is also the best song on Transcendental Youth. With both songs coming off three-digit victories, this match is a continental quarrel between equal-footed giants. Another word for Heretic Pride, though - Coming off of its victory against San Bernardino, while Amy barely squeak past its thematic cousin Heel Turn 2, it looks like an edge to victory would be a foregone conclusion. But I disagree. We need to remember its 4-point buzzerbeater over Damn These Vampires, remember how its defense falters when faced with other Tier 1 songs (and no offense to San Bernardino, but that was a Tier 2 cut by every definition, when up against a Tier 1 from the same damn album it had no chance). I'm parking my money comfortably in the Amy lane this time around. Its path to the top had among the highest difficulty ratings for any song in the region -- Animal Mask, Never Quite Free, Heel Turn 2 -- and its lowest spread against the toughest of these was still 9 points. It knows how to stay alive. Plus, those fucking DRUMS. Betting line:   8 Amy AKA Spent Gladiator 1 (2:1) vs #4 Heretic Pride (7:1)  7 Cry for Judas (3:2) vs #54 Sax Rohmer #1 (2:1)  Unreleased region:   And then there were eight. Two ""Going To""s, two food products, one place to buy them (unless that Store is in Hell), plus Cubs, Ox, and Cool. Live staple You Were Cool seems poised to continue its uninterrupted run at the top over Steal Smoked Fish, whose big leads have been challenged and narrowed in the past two rounds. Next, it's perennial goofball favorite Golden Boy against dreamlike wrestling fantasy Ox Baker Triumphant -- whoever wins, fans of melancholy, dirgelike Mountain Goats songs lose. Lots of interesting matchups in this region with only a few unqualified favorites. Potential Upsets: Store vs. Cubs in Five. The day Store beats Cubs in Five, I will love you again. That said, GO STORE!!!! Match to Watch: Going To (Maine U Alaska) finally asks how north is too north for Mountain Goats fans? I give the legacy edge to Alaska, plus the fact that John is pretty damn good with (what sounds like) a slide guitar, though Going to Maine's scores have been steadily improving since round one with no sign of stopping. Betting line:   1 You Were Cool (1:1) vs #5 Steal Smoked Fish (11:1)  33 Going to Maine (3:1) vs #20 Going to Alaska (3:1)  23 Golden Boy (2:1) vs #11 Ox Baker Triumphant (4:1)  50 Store (16:1) vs #3 Cubs in Five (2:3)"

themountaingoats,3bnow2,IronMikeWallace,8,Wed Jul 1 03:45:56 2015 UTC,Interesting Match-up Parallels:   WIWI vs Alphonse - choruses end with the name of a town Elijah vs TWBND - slow; could be seen as letters written to a significant other; mention God; culminate with allusions to rebirth/rising from the grave Up The Wolves vs Denton - stories of two people getting revenge on those who kept them down No Children vs Dance Music - songs about toxic relationships; narrator wants someone to die with Amy vs Heretic Pride - embracing the leadup to your inevitable death Cry for Judas vs Sax Rohmer - only songs on their respective albums to receive a music video; chalk (marks/Baphomet) You Were Cool vs Smoked Fish - the same four chords he uses most of the time; songs about old friends and hoping that they're better now Maine vs Alaska - going to; northernmost US point on the east vs the west; same chord progression Store vs Cubs in Five - The number five (in minutes/games)   (Anybody got anything for Golden Boy vs Ox Baker?)

Also, try not to jump octaves like between ""stuck in a projector"" and ""and you"". You sound more comfortable up high. Every ""you-oo-oo-oo-oo"" is perfect. If you sang the whole song in the range where you sang ""There are loose ends, by the score. What did I come down here for?"" this cover would be 10 times better. You're obviously a very talented singer, but you have got to make use of that."

themountaingoats,3bfle5,catamorphism,8,Tue Jun 30 18:28:39 2015 UTC,"Lo Fi Region:   The elite eight! On the whole, no major upsets besides Weekend in Western Illinois (you can reasonably count Elijah trouncing Shadow Song as well), but that just makes for another especially painful round of voting. This might be the tightest region of them all, at this point, with few clear favorites emerging out of all remaining matchups. Potential upsets: Weekend in Western Illinois taking down Grendel's Mother would be straight-up fairy tale, and given the lukewarm victories that have followed Grendel so far, it's a likely prospect. With its strongest opposition facing a volatile wild card, Alphonse Mambo seems to have solidified its grasp on the Western Conference, especially after a 2-point close call between its round-of-8 opponent Alpha Incipiens and Sweden heavyweight The Recognition Scene. Match to watch: Minnesota v. There Will Be No Divorce. Minnesota's victory in the last round wasn't as handy as There Will Be No Divorce's, but these two songs remain two of the strongest contenders for the region. Based on previous performance, expect There Will Be No Divorce to take it by a hair. Betting Line:   33 Weekend in Western Illinois vs #9 Grendel's Mother (+12)  15 Elijah vs #7 Baboon (+15)  3 Minnesota vs #11 There Will Be No Divorce (+7)  13 Alpha Incipiens vs #12 The Alphonse Mambo (+11)  Mid Fi Region:   Mid-Fi region laid waste to my expectations, seeing more wide-margin victories by its top seeds, casting out underdog favorites like Color In Your Cheeks. The Pigs That Ran Straightaway Into The Water have ended their great triumph, having never considered that the Tetrapod would edge them out to take on super-fave Best Ever Death Metal Band. Unless we see some Weekend In Western Illinois-style upsets this round, the likely final four in this group remains pretty open-and-shut. Still, the prevailing sense of ""all the big boys are winning"" could mean a sudden spike for underdog choices. Which brings us back to... Potential Upsets: This Year vs. Up the Wolves. If one song is able to take down the undisputed king of the Sunset Tree, it's the vengeful crown prince. Look for a thinner spread on this one, one that could potentially go either way.  Match to Watch: This Year v. Up the Wolves Betting Line:   1 This Year (+12) vs #8 Up the Wolves  2 No Children (+22) vs #7 Woke Up New  3 Dance Music (+28) vs #43 The Young Thousands  13 Hast Thou Considered the Tetrapod vs #5 The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton (+28)  Hi Fi Region:   So ends the songs of All Eternals Deck and Life of the World to Come. The legacy of Beat the Champ hangs entirely on the strugglebus chances of Heel Turn 2, which finds itself dwarfed against Western conference favorite Amy AKA Spent Gladiator 1. Now, basic arithmetic tells me that 2 > 1, but in this battle of changing allegiances and staying alive, it'll take more than a heel turn to beat the champ. Outside Heel Turn 2, it's a battle for supremacy between Heretic Pride and Transcendental Youth. Potential Upsets: Sax Rohmer #1 v. In Memory of Satan would be an upset in name only - Sax has pulled some of the biggest numbers all tournament from a position near the bottom of the barrel. Satan inched its way out of defeat last round, but I won't expect it to get so lucky this time. Match to Watch: The Diaz Brothers v. Cry For Judas. The two stars of Transcendental Youth squaring off on likely equal footing. One hell of a tough fight, nearly a wash. Betting Line   48 Heel Turn 2 vs #8 Amy AKA Spent Gladiator 1 (+19)  2 The Diaz Brothers vs #7 Cry for Judas (+6)  3 In Memory of Satan vs #54 Sax Rohmer #1 (+15)  4 Heretic Pride (+21) vs #12 San Bernardino  Unreleased Region:   With double the combatants and already so many words spent, I'll not be so thorough here in the unreleased region. Let it be known that Store kicks ass, The Anglo Saxons continue to be the strangest success story of the whole tournament, and Attention All Pickpockets continues to pull some of the most impressive numbers in the whole region. If there's a dark horse to unseat You Were Cool, count on Pickpockets. Potential Upsets: Alibi crushing Insurance Fraud last round was a little unexpected, but I count its days numbered going against mom-and-pop champion Store.  Match to Watch: Ox Baker Triumphant vs. The Sign. Both of them have proven to easy win in dominant positions, often by 40+ points, with The Sign pulling in greater numbers overall. But only Ox Baker went against You're In Maya and lived to tell the tale, complete with a 10+ point spread. It's a wash either way. Betting Line: to be introduced for Unreleased songs in the next round."
themountaingoats,3bfle5,Haberdashery2000,7,Mon Jun 29 00:25:18 2015 UTC,"This is awesome, i'm glad there are people as invested in the results of these polls as myself, and I hope you continue this through the end of the tournament. I feel like this deserves an explanation, but since the songs are seeded by the frequency they're played live on tour, and JD can never remember the words to Sax Rohmer and so rarely plays it, that one ended up getting seeded a lot lower than it probably should have been in terms of strict popularity. Even so, I didn't think it would get so far and have such a good chance of winning the whole thing."

themountaingoats,3bcy9o,Xamnam,9,Mon Jun 29 12:47:44 2015 UTC,"Warning: long, weird, poorly-worded, and emotional comment coming that I've been meaning to share anyways. This past year was my senior year of high school. The year before it, my ex-girlfriend broke up with me and it (along with other things) caused my depression to come back, and it came back hard. I was miserable for the rest of junior year (it got to the point where I couldn't even motivate myself to get out of bed in the morning, causing me to miss a lot of days) and of course, it carried into senior year. I started my senior year and not much had changed. I had a few good friends and that was nice, but I was still deeply unhappy with myself and had very destructive thoughts quite often. One morning, before I left for school, I got into a fight with my father and it was very close to escalating to violence (which is weird because I never really fight with my parents, we actually have a good relationship). I guess something was off that day, but I got into my car quickly and left. I decided to put on The Sunset Tree because why not, I just wanted to get to school. Now I don't know what it was, but during You or Your Memory, I just started bawling my fucking eyes out. It was as if all of the bullshit and stress and depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts had been building inside of me for months, and listening to that album just somehow cleansed me of all of it. I cried for a solid 10 minutes, and then had more random bursts of tears throughout my 30-minute drive. It was such a freeing experience and I had to sit in my car for about 10 minutes after I parked it to collect myself before I went into school. Did it cure me of all my problems? Of course not. In fact, I still struggle with my depression and feelings of loneliness. But having that moment, of me crying while those amazing songs played, changed me. I feel like if I had put on any other album, that wouldn't have happened and I would have never had had such an amazing emotional experience. To this day, The Sunset Tree is and always will be my favorite Mountain Goats album for having such a profound impact on my life."
themountaingoats,3bcy9o,angelfromthecoast,2,Sun Jun 28 04:14:55 2015 UTC,TST is also my favorite album by TMG. I can't say I've resonated with it as heavily as you have but it is extremely cathartic.
themountaingoats,3bcy9o,_Affexion_,5,Sun Jun 28 04:37:19 2015 UTC,ALL OF THEM.  But seriously the ones I can not possibly get through with dry eyes would be....  Amy  Deuteronomy 2:10  Never Quite Free  Maybe Sprout Wings  Cotton  &   Autoclave  That said I also burst into tears when I see roadkill and really process that it was a living thing and now it's just a mess being thoughtlessly smashed by hundreds of metal beasts.
themountaingoats,3bcy9o,Xamnam,2,Sun Jun 28 03:39:54 2015 UTC,"Deuteronomy 2:10   This song doesn't get nearly enough credit. I thanked him for playing it at one of the last shows I saw, and he mentioned that that's one of his songs that he's really proud of. He should be."

themountaingoats,3bcy9o,catamorphism,3,Sun Jun 28 01:47:47 2015 UTC,"I literally have a list of about 50 Mountain Goats songs that have made me cry at least once, though once I start crying I don't tend to stop, so some of those may not have brought me there on my own.  The more reliable ones for crying, for me, are Jeff Davis County Blues, Broom People (only after I heard some of the live versions with intros from 2011), and Matthew 25:21 (ex-lover died of cancer two years ago and I'm not over it). Minnesota will do it for me if I'm in the right mood.  It would almost be easier for me to make a list of which post-2004 songs haven't made me cry."
themountaingoats,3bcy9o,a_dag,3,Sun Jun 28 02:01:53 2015 UTC,Definitely definitely 'Noctifer Burmingham'. Even now after a thousand listens it still makes me sad.

themountaingoats,3bcy9o,BuildYourComputer,2,Sun Jun 28 17:52:18 2015 UTC,"Pale green things because I almost watched my abusive father die in front of me after a fist fight, and all up the seething coast because I used to be an addict. But that doesn't even scratch the surface of emotional connection I have with his songs.   EDIT: And Going to Georgia. That's a great one. Especially the live version he did for NPR. That whole little set was great."

Clears the way for The Alphonse Mambo to take the western conference. Eastern is definitely turning into a Group of Death though... I can reasonable see any one of Jaipur/California Song/Minnesota/There Will Be No Divorce taking the whole damn region.  RIP Oceanographer's Choice. Had my fake money on that pulling a stunning round-of-8 upset. Same with The Mess Inside.  Woke Up New continues to carry the weight of Get Lonely, but for how long? Time is definitely revealing that album to be one of JD's most underrated, at least by the reddit fandom.  Young Thousands continues its rampage. After seeing that song live in Chicago, I'm convinced it stands easily among TMG's best. Probably end of the line for the Pigs, though.  Did NOT expect Old College Try to destroy the way it did. Making me rethink the whole region. Though Hast Thou Considered's edging out of Game Shows proves that Sunset Tree still holds up to the strongest Tallahassee competitors. This Year v. Old College Try is shaping up to be the match to watch this round in that rivalry; though This Year is the heavy favorite, if College Try could narrow its win to a margin of 15 or less, that spells bad news for its future.  You Were Cool is emerging as the only clear favorite in its whole region, pulling the only three-digit victory (though Cubs in Five came close), plus an unlikely string of 50-seed upsets seemingly tosses the rest of its competition in the western conference into flux. But I don't care, because I'm on Team Store. Keep going Store!!!!!!!! Keep going and never stop!!!!!!!!!!!!  Predicted upsets for this round: Color in Your Cheeks, Matthew 25, Heel Turn 2, Sign of the Crow 2, Going to Chino (again!)

The full phrase is ""Would that the people of Rome had but one neck, I would slit it."" Though on the album art, the words ""I would slit it it"" are left out.  Additionally, it is worth noting that 'ceructem' is not a word, and in its place should be 'cervicem', that is to say, neck. It is reasonable to assume that when it was added to the album art, it was probably just written down wrong or misremembered."

themountaingoats,3b9dxr,descole0,3,Sat Jun 27 04:20:12 2015 UTC,"Not really, but very few triangle parts are simply ""hit it at these times."" Most will involve dampening it and letting it ring in some sort of pattern (I don't have a great way of explaining this) or rolls, which kinda suck because if you mess them up it sounds horrible. Also dynamics are tricky because if you're at the back of the band playing a small instrument it's hard to tell how loudly the audience hears it. Also occasionally the strings break during a concert and the triangle falls to the floor as you enter the slow section and everyone in the band, including the director, has to try (succesfully) not to laugh.   It's definitely still one of the easiest instruments to play, but it can get a little tricky at times."

themountaingoats,3b8ok1,abluecolor,3,Sat Jun 27 00:47:31 2015 UTC,"Alpha Incipiens.  It's just quick, in your face, and brimming with spunky passion that can only come from one man."

themountaingoats,3b8ok1,mouse_skeleton,4,Fri Jun 26 22:02:24 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with the other commenters about this song but agree with it for a few reasons; 1. the conflict of lovers 2. the finality of decisions in life 3. the inherent mistakes in our decision making processes 4. our drive for resolution in conflict vs. our love of conflict  i think this is the right answer.  I don't care what John thinks about the song, it still lives as the cultural center of MG fans.  Before/After."
themountaingoats,3b8ok1,BurroughOwl,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:21:15 2015 UTC,Does John not like this one?
themountaingoats,3b8ok1,TheAllStarrBand,3,Sat Jun 27 16:46:45 2015 UTC,"Eh, he did that song ironically. Plus it's his most popular. I'd say that's definitely not it, although it is a good song."
themountaingoats,3b8ok1,BuildYourComputer,2,Sat Jun 27 02:48:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, sorry, don't hold me to that, it's an impulse answer and there's realistically no way I could actually answer this."
themountaingoats,3b8ok1,mouse_skeleton,2,Sat Jun 27 02:52:16 2015 UTC,"I'd vote for Source Decay. It's wistful, poetic, about a failed relationship, and makes a lot of references to places and things."

themountaingoats,3b8ok1,longwinters,3,Fri Jun 26 22:33:05 2015 UTC,probably his most approachable song.
themountaingoats,3b8ok1,BurroughOwl,3,Sat Jun 27 03:22:45 2015 UTC,"Like, we all wanna say going to Georgia or something fairly universally adored but John has actively distanced himself from that song due to the unhealthy displays of misplaced affection, and it's not much of a reflection of the recent years. This year is a gateway drug. It's a window into the overall theme of endurance and survival above all things, and a story about how the other songs were able to be written, because the narrator did it. It really does have all of the most important elements."
themountaingoats,3b8ok1,longwinters,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:09:21 2015 UTC,that's an intersting dynamic.  His earlier stuff was about hating the person you love the most and his latest stuff is about enduring life no matter what.  Obviously neither is a perfect conciliation but you know...sorta' kinda' like how it is.
themountaingoats,3b8ok1,BurroughOwl,4,Sat Jun 27 04:25:48 2015 UTC,"Hebrews 11:40, Isaiah 45:23, White Cedar, or Against Pollution. Operative theme: being cleansed.  There are more I'm sure"

themountaingoats,3b74qe,_Affexion_,3,Fri Jun 26 17:05:57 2015 UTC,Where did you hear about it? Is it confirmed our rumored? It makes sense and I think I even briefly searched for it awhile back but nothing came of that...
themountaingoats,3b74qe,BabyBlueSedan88,4,Fri Jun 26 17:14:54 2015 UTC,"Detailed on the wiki. It has been played live a couple times :)   The song is a comical lament made by a ""face"" wrestler, who has been ""good"" his whole life and is finally tempted to the dark side just to stay standing in a battle royale."
themountaingoats,3b74qe,Haberdashery2000,3,Fri Jun 26 17:19:05 2015 UTC,"Heel Turn II is one of my favorite songs ever, and I was at the show in Chicago where Heel Turn I was apparently played, but I had a few too many and barely remember the show.  God damn I'm regretting it now."
themountaingoats,3b9p99,BurroughOwl,6,Sat Jun 27 03:16:38 2015 UTC,"i absolutely adore it. It was one that grew on me, because i couldnt listen to it after my first listen because i just cried after the first half then turned it off and didnt listen again for a month. Now i can deal with it and its actually an album that i really REALLY connect with. I feel the same way about Tallahassee. The sad songs are almost self assuring and make me feel warm and okay inside. Idk how to describe it."

themountaingoats,3b7nw4,CatMadeOfFur,4,Fri Jun 26 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"semi blind was earnest. It was roughly 5am and I was not going to get any sleep unless I put it on paper. I'm more a medium for my writing than a writer, it's like possession. I'll probably mill over this one till it comes back to me and gets finished, but yea, writing for me is weird...  TLDR; I actually wrote this in but the streetlight through the bedroom window, eyes blinded by sleep and darkness. I was legitimately surprised it was at all decipherable when I woke."

themountaingoats,3b66fl,lovelylayout,5,Fri Jun 26 12:57:28 2015 UTC,He's incredibly involved; It's real a passion of his. I know he's mentioned reproductive rights more than a handful of times on his tumblr. This is a good article as a whole that has some choice bits about the topic at the bottom.  And just look at the setlists he's played for  benefit concerts.  (Nice flair!)
themountaingoats,3b66fl,Xamnam,2,Fri Jun 26 13:16:15 2015 UTC,"(Thank you!) I really should have made the connection by now-- there used to be a two-song set on Youtube that I loved of him performing at some pro-choice event somewhere. I think it was Jenny and Color in Your Cheeks that he played. I've looked for it, but it doesn't seem to be up anymore."

Of course, one could make the argument that humor trivializes the seriousness of the subject matter...it should be noted, however, that the last time the Mountain Goats played Houseguest was in 2012, the same year they stopped playing Going to Georgia."
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,FreeAsCheap,9,Thu Jun 25 15:33:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd say Houseguest is romanticizing. They're both from the perspective of the person doing something negative, but with Going to Georgia, well, like the blog post says ""I can dig it! He must really be in love, to be so fucked up!"" Fast paced, major key, fist pumping, shouting along.   Houesguest, on the other hand, builds up a sense of dread over the course of the song. It starts off believably innocuous, but you're supposed to identify less and less with the actions of the narrator as it progresses.   Also, along professionalecho's, lines, go listen to the original by Nothing Painted Blue. It's not something that's a musical exultation in joy. It's almost stalker like: slow methodical build up to the violent chorus.   I guess, let's put it this way. Going to Georgia was about the positive repercussions of violence, to save/claim a relationship. Houseguest is about the negative repercussions of jealously/obsession."
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,Xamnam,2,Thu Jun 25 12:49:48 2015 UTC,"I personally think it's closer to the Ezekiel end, but also John didn't write Houseguest. It's a Franklin Bruno song."
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,professionalecho,3,Thu Jun 25 12:29:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly think John overthinks his songs sometimes because he forgets that his songs are about characters that are usually flawed and many times don't do good things.  There are songs like Oceanographer's Choice, No Children, or Alibi that are from the perspective of an individual that does bad things to someone else (domestic violence, extreme bitterness towards another person, cheats) but we realize that these are not things we should look at in a good light.    Going to Georgia captures the thought process of an extremely over-romantic individual and the euphoric feeling they have internally when they manage to terrorize the person they love into staying with them.  Yes, it's f'd up, but crowds are relating to that insane-like euphoric feeling (much like the pent up anger release in No Children) and not the part about doing destructive things to someone you care about.  Most fans of the song don't even realize that the main character is threatening suicide to his significant other and instead think he is just some crazed individual who needs a gun for some reason but realizes everything is going to be OK when he sees his lover.  I understand that John, knowing the full meaning of the song, would personally stop playing it... but I feel he should have stayed away from explaining why, as well as explaining the specific meaning of the song, because it ruined it for a lot of fans.  It is his song, but he somewhat is forgetting that every fan gets their own meaning out of each song, and for a song with vague lyrics like Going to Georgia, most fans just take away the crazy, uncontrollable exuberance for life that being head over heels in love can bring.  To specifically tell your fans it's not about that and actually is about terrorizing someone into staying with you somewhat ruins that.  A song may be an artist's creation, but what the listener takes out of that creation should not be dictated by the artist.  EDIT: Just to clarify, until I heard John talk about why he wasn't playing GtG anymore, I thought the song was about a young man on the run from either the law or some dangerous individuals (hence the gun) and was rushing home to his lover because things were out of control.  When he sees her, he thinks everything is going to be all right, feels euphoric seeing her, and doesn't need the gun anymore regardless of who is gunning for him.  That is an extremely romantic take on the song and gave this feeling that love can overcome even the worst of times and soothe even the most desperate individuals.  John's explanation blew that take out of the water and I can never look at the song in the same light again."
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,getmoney7356,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:33:55 2015 UTC,Houseguest is funny and the humor is at the expense of the narrator. Going to Georgia isn't funny - I don't really see a way to relate to it other than identifying with the narrator's heartfelt sentiments.

themountaingoats,3b2bjx,_Affexion_,2,Thu Jun 25 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"Sure, the song is relatable but over and over again people identify with it and use to validate their stupid, harmful relationship behavior. I think by not playing Georgia, John is basically saying: ""yeah, do what you will but not on my watch."" He's trying not to contribute to the problem.    For example, it's been deleted now it looks like but there was a tumblr post going around called Mountain Goats Gothic that contained a bunch of references to songs that were dark and moody etc...someone reblogged it along with a vivid, bloody Tarantino-esque description of a GtG style lover's execution.  It was very much that trope of crazy lover's murder and it was totally glorified and it was really close to GtG.  I think it's that kind of thing that John might not want to perpetuate.    By coming out and saying ""I'm not playing this song and this is why,"" he is actively making a statement AGAINST behaviour like that instead of just passively accepting that he wrote the song and doesn't feel like it's appropriate anymore.  I actually really respect that he took a stand on it. I think it's great."
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,skcup,2,Thu Jun 25 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"That's true. I entirely respect that he's actively telling people he doesn't approve of that kind of insanity. I guess I've never actually seen GtG as a kidnapping scenario, I've always seen it as another ""Going to..."" song about a misguided couple picking the worst possible way to run away from their problems.  Side note, WHAT THE EVERLOVING FUCK is with these random psychos latching onto tMG? This is not the first case I've heard of now."
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,_Affexion_,2,Thu Jun 25 18:40:02 2015 UTC,"Side note, WHAT THE EVERLOVING FUCK is with these random psychos latching onto tMG? This is not the first case I've heard of now.   His songs, especially his early stuff, contain many themes of anger, bitterness, conflict, and angst somehow being beautiful.  Most fans will take away the message of ""hey, even when things are messed up or I'm angry, there's still beauty in life"" while others will focus on ""anger and bitterness IS beautiful.""  It makes a lot of sense that a gothic mentality will focus on the second message and not the first.  Doesn't mean that the song is invalidated or that we are somehow wrong for being fans."
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,getmoney7356,2,Thu Jun 25 19:10:41 2015 UTC,"I guess I can understand that. It is an intricately blurry line, honestly. And it's not always an in spite of scenario.

But now we're touching on my convoluted life philosophy and Jesus what a mess..."
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,_Affexion_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:46:23 2015 UTC,"Let me elaborate. I went through a point in my youth where I had this detached romantic notion of violence. Writing was my outlet and I think that's a great way to handle the disturbed whims of puberty. I joke sometimes about what would have happened if I had been in school today and someone had found my writing, but the truth is, I would be on the news. I wrote about shooting up my school, killing the bullies. I'm not proud, but it kept me sane until I found peace inside myself. I even once wrote a short story about a couple killing their family and running off as reckless outlaws against the world. It was pedantic, I get that now, but I guess part of me feels like JD is taking away a bit of the validity of that personal outlet."
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,_Affexion_,5,Thu Jun 25 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people had that phase which is why the song is so relatable.  I can also relate to not wanting anything I produced from that mindset to be widely discussed in my adult life, TBH."

themountaingoats,3b2bjx,Staals,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"I personally have always seen it as more on the Going to Georgia side than the Ezekiel side, and I agree with JD on those two songs so I'm not really disappointed they don't play Houseguest any more, as much as I like it musically. The main reason I'm uncomfortable with Houseguest is it has that cathartically aggressive singalong feel to me, which I think encourages people to identify with the narrator. (This is based on the tMG version as I haven't heard the original, but then the tMG version is the only impression many people will have of the song.)  I guess the difference is GtG and Houseguest sound like they're reveling in how dangerous the narrator is to others, and Ezekiel 7's narrator just sounds kind of empty and hopeless, like he just does this because he has to and has to detach himself from sympathizing with his victims. Ezekiel 7 is also more interesting to me because the narrator is caught up in something much larger than himself and couldn't easily stop if he wanted to (and the cartel would just get someone else to do his job anyway), and there's a lot of ambiguity about how he feels about it.  tl;dr: Ezekiel 7 subverts the Scary Violent Guy trope, GtG and Houseguest play it straight, I prefer the former"
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,goat_blocker,2,Thu Jun 25 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"When I hear ""Houseguest"" I don't identify with the narrator at all (whose gender, by the way, isn't specified unless I've forgotten something.) I think ""wow, what an asshole."" I hear the ""when people refuse me love"" line and think that while the person performing the song might have a little bit of a connection with that line, the song is exploring what would happen if somebody took that mild tendency and decided to be a total asshole about it. It's clearly a fantasy.  Going to Georgia is, I guess, hard to read as anything other than a fantasy as well, but it really seems to romanticize that idea whereas I can't imagine taking any conclusion from Houseguest other than, ""well, I'm glad I'm actually a person with boundaries and wouldn't do this."""
themountaingoats,3b2bjx,catamorphism,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:33:49 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: Going to Georgia is one of my favorite Mountain Goats' songs.   I don't personally think that the song glorifies the subjects' behavior, i always took it as putting you inside the mind of a violent reckless person. Like Xamnam said, the fast-paced, major key, almost fight-song like quality, puts you into this person's perspective. He's so sure he's doing the right thing, that his behavior is just means to an end. He's thrilled cause he's going to get his girl back by any means necessary. As fans we shout and get behind most of Johns' characters and this is no different at first. I think you're meant to sympathize with this person initially but once you give it a proper listen you realize that this is another one of the broken and delusional characters John creates. He's in his own world unable to see how wrong he really is. I think it effectively shows that this person is delusional and ultimately dangerous. But everyone interprets these things differently and i definitely respect the decision to retire it."

themountaingoats,3b2bjx,kidsoftheblackhole,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:09:32 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm inclined to think there's no particular reason why John stopped playing Houseguest (you could ask the same question about, e.g. 9 of the 13 songs on All Eternals Deck, all of which have been played live either never or not since 2012), since he hasn't said anything about it AFAIK.  As far as Going to Georgia, I wonder why the people who are that into it, especially so far into it as to resent John for ""ruining"" it for them, are into that one in particular and not the hundreds of other Mountain Goats songs that you could be into. It's a good song (or at least the music is, and it has a few good lines despite the problematic theme), but it just doesn't seem that good to me compared to, you know, those hundreds of other songs. I wonder if people would be so into it if John had never said he thought it was bullshit, but maybe that's unfair for me to wonder."

You were not gonna hear their rendition any other way. I think I first heard it at a show in 2005 I wanna say, and then several times after that. So I think that's why it's interesting that it's been missing lately, but it also may just be that they're tired of it or don't want it to take up space in the setlist."

I think he just chooses phrases that sound cool to him (or they have some personal meaning). Half the song titles on the old stuff are bizarre.

themountaingoats,3b0sd0,catamorphism,2,Thu Jun 25 08:56:59 2015 UTC,"He mentioned in the same Gothenburg Radio interview that I linked to above (which isn't on the Internet anymore, sorry) that the fire alarm came from a pamphlet about UTIs that he picked up in a Swedish hospital.  How much that explains is in the eye of the beholder.  By the way, Kyle Barbour's fan site with annotations for most of the albums is incredibly informative and useful. I don't think it necessarily explains all the album titles, but there's a lot of useful background info there that you might like to read if you're wondering about this kind of thing."
themountaingoats,3b0sd0,catamorphism,2,Thu Jun 25 21:40:04 2015 UTC,"John explained the title of Sweden in this interview:   ""People keep asking me that. In Germany, when they ask me that, it's because they think I'm a fascist. It's true. It's because they think, this guy likes Sweden, he must be one of those skinhead types. But I'm not, but I grew up watching Bergman movies, Wild Strawberries, Cries and Whispers, and I saw Fanny and Alexander the week it came out in the US, and I love that stuff and I love the plays of August Strindberg, a lot, I love them. And also, I'm from California, now, can you picture US geography? So you know, California, it's the west end. You pass California, you drop off the face of the earth. I've always loved places like that. I'm rethinking all of this because of where I live now, which is Iowa, but my first love has always been places that are so extreme that you either can't go any further or you can never leave, right. And so, Sweden, I found out last year, in fact, parts of Norway are further north than Sweden, but to those of us in the West, when you think of Sweden, you think of, that's the top of the world. It's not going any higher. You cannot -- if you're running away from something, you can't run much further than to go to Sweden.""   From some comments elsewhere, Tallahassee seems to have been chosen as a setting for that album for similar reasons (the Alpha Couple ran from California as far east as they could get without leaving the US).  Wolf in White Van has a thing with geography and directions going on, too. I don't know if there's any connection between that and this theme of running away from things to places that are as far as you can go, but it's hard not to notice that it seems similar."

themountaingoats,3b0sd0,catamorphism,2,Thu Jun 25 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"John has talked a lot recently about his love for William Gass, an author who is known for constructing syllables, phrases and sentences, really focusing on the sounds and hypnotic qualities of words.  In Wolf in White Van, there's an image of young Sean creating the Trace Italian logo. I imagine this is something JD told from images he had in his mind of creating logos for imagined games, books and bands in jr. high or thereabouts.  So I think you can combine those two ideas together for how JD comes up with album titles: think of William Gass trying to come up with names for death metal bands. (I'm kind of chuffed with myself, i think that's a great description of TMG in general). ""Heretic Pride"" would be the most obvious example of this.  My personal favorite album, and album title, is ""All Eternals Deck."" It took me some time figure out what the hell it meant, although it was immediately obvious to some people — in a tarot reading, you might rarely get the eternal card and that's considered profound or auspicious, so then you have this image of a deck of cards filled with eternal cards. I think when I first saw it announced, I maybe had some idea of like a ship or something…way off base.  Much of the fun of being a TMG fan is that each song is a world you can dive into. JD invites you to go down various holes with him, and I think him being a kind of obsessive person with a touch of the Aspergers and most of the fans being similar, he often writes songs about really obscure stuff and then you learn about some weird little corner of the world as a result."

themountaingoats,3b0sd0,catamorphism,2,Fri Jun 26 03:27:15 2015 UTC,"I would actually say JD would never qualify for an official diagnosis of Asperger's because he has an unusual ability to name and describe a depth of human experience that very few people can. He's the opposite of Asperger's in that way. But I think he bridges a gap, too, and that's why he's created such a loyal (often described as cultish, fairly I'd say) fanbase. That gap he's bridging is that he's speaking in a language and using touchpoints of geek culture, and he's often been called professorial for his unusual speaking patterns. He's a translator of emotions for nerds. I remember reading a Vice review once and it was just like ""ugh, this is like someone singing the dictionary,"" which made me laugh. If you're that sort of prototypical Vice-reader, coked up at the first electroclash shows in 2001, TMG is probably everything you're not about. It's these things that you could read as Asperger's-like, but as Hans Asperger himself said, ""It seems that for success in science or art, a dash of autism is essential."" So in no way do I mean it as a put-down."
themountaingoats,3b0sd0,mcathen,2,Fri Jun 26 03:56:02 2015 UTC,"I would never dream of calling it a put-down, I just think it's better not to label people with labels they wouldn't use for themselves."

Hope you enjoy!  -lyrics-   huggie boy grew up on the right side of the street  and had conversations with all kinds the strangers that he'd meet  alright... most of them where in his head  but he didn't care about that it was those talks that kept him fed   the new kid at the school would flash people his knife  and i guess we wasn't getting enough at home cause he was always picking fights one day he decided that huggie would be his latest meal  i guess he never heard you don't bite from the hand whose lunch money you steal   so recess the next day as they met up by the swings  as huggie wished the the strangers knew about dodging things that sting  the line started to build up and crowd started to fade  then huggie ducked under a jab and yelled the only thing he could say   i will never stop loving you  and its totally independent of the stupid things you do  all i have is this hug for you  as he ran in to line with a healthy peace of mind and hoped punch kid felt so too

themountaingoats,3aze9f,skcup,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:14:42 2015 UTC,scary in what way? Let me fess up: I'm here and there.  I like the forums a lot. I find the reddit less accountable or something that I enjoy less but I'm not sure why.  Curious to know if there's a personality type or particular expectation that makes one platform work better for one person and not for another.
themountaingoats,3aze9f,skcup,3,Wed Jun 24 19:56:35 2015 UTC,"Well, e.g. Xamnam's comment: ""This subreddit also has the reputation for being very earnest for every possible scrap of material that exists."" I would rather not be someplace where it's considered shameful (or something? that's the best I can come up with as an interpretation of this sentence) to want to hear everything. If my enthusiasm bothers some people, I'd rather not bother them, you know?"
themountaingoats,3aze9f,Xamnam,5,Wed Jun 24 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"This is my personal opinion but I would not protest against ""earnestness"" for material but I would and do against what I perceive to be a sense of entitlement to it.  I don't know enough about the culture here on the reddit to know if that's a real issue but I think it's a weird thing how people seem to feel entitled to rare and unreleased material now that the internet has made it so accessible.  I think there is a more pronounced tendency against that sentiment on the forums than there is here.  I'm not sure if that's the same thing Xamnam is describing, just my two cents."
themountaingoats,3aze9f,abluecolor,5,Wed Jun 24 21:57:27 2015 UTC,"That's actually right along the lines of my thoughts.  /u/catamorphism, I love the Mountain Goats. I generally want to hear everything that John puts out. Barring stuff that he doesn't want distributed, I'd say I've heard most songs he's written. Don't let me come across as being against people excited for what he's made. If the literally impossible happened, and the West Texas Orphans were released somehow, I would be sprinting here to listen and talk about them. I'm not here to shame people for loving a band, at all, and I'm sorry if I came across harshly in what I said. That sort of enthusiasm does not bother me.   It's specifically those big bulky rarities/unreleased zips that I was talking about. Those festishize the collection side of things, the ""I need to possess every possible version of every song."" I understand the desire to do that, I've fallen prey to it myself at times, but I find that typically runs at cross purposes to appreciation. When you find one new song, you'll listen to it, think about it, reflect, listen some more times. When people get those zip files, suddenly, they have 100+ new songs, and it's easy to gorge on them en masse, without looking at each one with the individual attention it deserves.  This is just my opinion, and I know that not everyone shares it. But it's my opinion.   I will also say, I say all that as someone who generally hangs out here, not on the forums. My summation of their opinions isn't well researched."
themountaingoats,3aze9f,skcup,2,Wed Jun 24 22:26:21 2015 UTC,"I'll really never understand this- either here or on the forums, I've never seen anyone acting entitled to rare bootlegs or whatever. It's all just earnest ""I'd really like to hear this"" stuff, not entitled ""I have a right to hear this"" stuff. Just my opinion from browsing over the last few years."
themountaingoats,3aze9f,abluecolor,3,Thu Jun 25 17:34:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know about here but I've definitely seen people whining about how they don't have all the rare stuff and some people will trade rare stuff with their friends but exclude people they don't know.  I'd also suggest that whoever compiled the big rarities pack from last month demonstrated a serious sense of entitlement over work that someone else made and someone else recorded, neither of whom particularly wanted the material public.    Basically, ""I have a right to mass distribute this stuff and other people have a right to hear it despite the wishes of those who made it"" was the message I got from anyone doing that. To me, that's clear entitlement but I guess it just depends on how you perceive it. It's not that it's not also earnest at the same time."

Just for some additional info:  Out of print, but publicly released:  Pretty much in the clear, but John would really like if you made a donation of some sort to go along with it. That was the request he made with the free download of Satanic Messiah. Farm Sanctuary is one he's fond of.   Live shows:  John is big on the ephemeral nature of music, he's said repeatedly that his old stuff isn't always great, and doesn't necessarily like to be reminded of it, and thinks it's cool how some stuff just isn't recorded, but, he also understands the desire to share and trade this stuff. From archive.org's page:   RIGHTS From: John Darnielle Sent: Tuesday, July 06, 2004 9:12 AM To: Jon Aizen Subject: Re: Archiving Mountain Goats concerts [Internet Archive]  Hi Jon,  It's certainly OK with me for you guys to put up shows, I'm a longtime tape-trader supporter (though I do think online trading takes a lot of the fun/community out of things). I personally don't record my shows or keep copies of 'em & I'm always puzzled by artists who do.  Thanks for listening to my songs!  Best  John    CP: Does it bug you that everybody tapes your shows?  JD: I am totally in favor of tape trading, and file sharing never did anything wrong by me. People got into The Mountain Goats after downloading my stuff. The only people who are afraid of file sharing are the people whose albums are so dull presentation-wise that nobody cares about owning the actual finished product, and the people who have so little connection to their listeners that said listeners have no reason to care whether the artists they like are getting reimbursed for their efforts. My listeners are very kind to me and have tended to buy the albums whether the MP3s are available for free or not, and I always try to make the albums nice to look at and to hold in your hands while you listen. Usually by going completely overboard with text credits, but you know what I mean.   That all said, some of the members of the forum have a moderately different opinion here. That bit up there John said about online trading taking the community out of it? They're big on keeping the community aspect. They trade rare shows, or let people listen without giving away the actual files, build up friendships, and make something larger out of it. I'm not going to weigh in on that here. Just know that some people aren't in favor of every recording ever being publicly available.   The one big unapproved one  is Hail and Farewell, Gothenburg, and it's kind of emblematic of the entire issue here. I'll let John speak for himself, across a couple posts on the tMG forums. I'm going to go on for a bit here, because it's why I care about if John cares. I'm going to bold a couple bits that show his thoughts on both sides of the issue.    requests for unreleased material will be deleted and your post has been changed accordingly. People can talk about the album all day if they like, but using forums I myself am hosting at no cost as a place to do something I have asked people not to do is really uncool.   The tape of HAFG is mastered too fast, by the way - the voice and guitar on it are about a full tone higher than they were actually performed. I wasn't gonna ruin people's enjoyment of it by telling y'all this, but if people insist on ""it's not what you'd prefer, it's my right to your private stuff,"" then they can live with the truth of the matter. Word!  (this sort of ""I have a right to your private stuff,"" by the way, is why the All Hail West Texas outtakes - about fifteen songs - have all been destroyed; I would eventually have made them available for free, but the HAFG affair made it clear to me that if I wasn't willing to cede control over my own material completely, I had to kinda take radical steps)  (and finally, I hope people won't think I'm fuming mad or anything - I'm not! shit happens, album's easy to find now. The forums I am personally hosting though? Not the place to request material that I didn't want released. I love everybody OK thx bye!)  For those who're curious, yeah for sure the whole Gothenburg deal has had a chilling effect on me - I now delete/erase/destroy anything I don't feel like I'll wanna release, since I don't want this sort of thing to happen again. That makes me sad, 'cause I used to have archives of all sorts of weird stuff that at some point would all have been given out for free. New world, different rules!   Anyhow yeah though. Monkeyskull is not a bad apple, I'm just kinda touchy about this subject, since it does seem like people often say ""hey, if you didn't want people to hear it, you shouldn't have even recorded it,"" which is, as I say, pretty limiting to one's creativity.  it is my preference that people not listen to this stuff - obviously nobody's gotta respect my preference, though it's kinda weird that people are so cavalier about it (""well, I want it; end of story"") - it hurts my feelings. If that's ""thin-skinned,"" well, whatever y'know? That's how I am. I make myself available to people who like my stuff, and I'm open with them; it's one of the things that makes me different from other music dudes. It's gonna be a forum rule that requesting stuff like this will result in thread deletion etc. - them's the breaks.   to answer your question though - everybody who records makes HUNDREDS of songs they don't want anyone to hear, if not thousands. One learns from recording stuff. It's a valuable process, and it can be instructive to return to stuff and see how it went - what the process was. Now I know better than to leave it hanging around, and I destroy stuff I don't want people to hear. Such is the world, nothing to do about it!   (Your whole ""only people who are willing to satisfy my request are being reasonable"" schtick is a li'l bogus tho you gotta admit - my position, that people ought to respect my wishes and not listen to something I didn't choose to release, is as valid as yours & worth your consideration)  it's an interesting idea whether my opinion counts or not, but my experience shows me that such an effort would only encourage people to seek out the songs and say how great they are. I really appreciate people who respect my position on this & thank you for your sympathy, but the fact is that many people get an especial thrill out of knowing that I didn't condone the release of this material. That makes the material better for them - Q.E.D., the material is garbage and would have been condemned as such had I released it; any fool can hear that the tape is running at the wrong speed and my voice is sped up, but people like to say how good the tape is anyhow. But the special sheen it gets from my condemnation only makes it more appealing for people, and any attempt to erase it from collective memory would only increase that sheen for those same sorts of people.    So, yeah. Generally, if you google what you're looking for, especially within the Mountain Goats forum, the public sentiment will let you know if it's something John wants out there or not.   That said, this is just my understanding and recollection. Unless I'm directly quoting John, I definitely don't speak for him or his thoughts.   I hope I didn't scare you unnecessarily, and that this helped. I found it interesting to research, which is why it's so long, and for that I apologize. :p"

themountaingoats,3aze9f,mouse_skeleton,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:34:04 2015 UTC,"I had seen a few choice quotes from the Gothenburg incident, but overall I didn't know about any of that. I might have a copy of HaFG somewhere on my computer, but I've never listened to it because of JD's quotes there. So tapes are sort of a grey area depending on how he currently feels about the particular show... That's where I'm a little conflicted. I can understand where he's coming from, but there are those few live only unreleased tracks that- to my knowledge- he hasn't played again since. Every year the catalogue grows and the chance of some of those songs ever being played again gets smaller and smaller. I love some of those songs (like Any Available Surface) pretty intensely and there's a good chance I'll never hear them even if I go to every show. Technically, he owes us nothing because they are his songs. Technically we owe him nothing because he played them for an audience. The right answer is somewhere in between. So I think I'll continue to collect the albums in ways that directly support JD and listen to some of the live tracks he may or may not like as long as I have them. If I can have Any Available Surface and a few others, I promise to never open that Hail and Farewell Gothenburg zip file.  I'm really trying to do right by him because he has made his feelings clear and been in close contact with the community. I appreciate how genuine he is (I don't think he could make the music he does if he wasn't) and I respect that. But, there's also a point where you can't George Lucas your recordings just because you aren't the same person you were when they were made. Or shouldn't, at any rate."

Basically if he wanted people to have it, it would be released.  He's made it clear that it's generally cool to trade live shows but there's been a sense that he doesn't love the really old shows surfacing now.  I'm not sure whether he's expressed an opinion about the taper's rights to material issue.    Another perspective too (mine) is that releasing rare song batches from live shows is crappy because it disambiguates the songs from their context (i.e., banter, overall show vibe) etc which really detracts from the experience.  I really hate zips like those that have surfaced recently where there are a bunch of really rare songs all compiled together for mass consumption. It kind of feels like buying a case lot of cereal boxes and dumping them all out on the ground to collect the prizes.  But that's a personal preference and I know plenty of people don't mind."
themountaingoats,3aze9f,stephenp182,2,Wed Jun 24 21:02:40 2015 UTC,"I'd say that's a pretty good overview. There's really just one big thing that JD is categorically against that is pretty much out there to find, and that's Hail and Farewell, Gothenburg, which I'm going to go over in a separate post.   I definitely agree with your second paragraph there. Chopping up live shows just because there's one rare track is lame."

themountaingoats,3auecr,iGoByManyNames,11,Tue Jun 23 16:18:48 2015 UTC,"JD is very much against glancing at the past long enough to do something like re-record. I remember him saying somewhere that he even regretted re-recording those two songs for Nothing for Juice--he wished they could've been replaced with two new original songs.  For people who (and I can't fathom how) can't stand the wheel-grind, they may want to look into live recordings. A lot of those have even cleaner quality than the ""official"" versions of the old songs."

All live recordings are different and capture something of the moment and the mood that created them, and to a degree, I think this is part of what he's getting at regarding the lo-fi songs.

themountaingoats,3auecr,CatMadeOfFur,2,Wed Jun 24 03:13:36 2015 UTC,"I remember reading that, partially because of his addiction, in the early days of tMG if a song wasn't recorded in a short amount of time after coming up with it (I think 2 weeks? Maybe as short as 24 hours, I can't find the interview) he'd toss it and never record it."
themountaingoats,3auecr,d4mini0n,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"Not really because of the addiction, and not really a set time frame.

Basically he's sort of impatient with his songs: if it doesn't cooperate, he's more than ready to scrap it."
themountaingoats,3auecr,yeartwo,3,Tue Jun 23 23:25:38 2015 UTC,"The full liner notes are here:  http://kylebarbour.org/tmg/ahwt.html  When I read this part and really thought about it, I felt like I understood why the old songs sounded the way they did:   Of course the original signal is never actually anywhere near any recordings anywhere, but you all already knew that. You have been sure of it for quite some time now. You see the proof everywhere. It is the reason you started reading these lines in the first place."
themountaingoats,3auecr,catamorphism,15,Wed Jun 24 01:00:24 2015 UTC,"Why, why why? Why would anyone want them re-recorded?"
themountaingoats,3auecr,_Affexion_,6,Tue Jun 23 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"I think the predominant way people come into contact with tMG is John Green, if we're being honest, which leads them straight to the most recent studio albums. Considering BTC had some incredible instrumentation, fans that explore backwards and find the early stuff will probably be put off if they don't like that kind of stuff already.   To be honest I 100% agree with the point about Going to Maine, I'd love to hear an updated version of that.  edit: I guess i should expand upon the last part. I love the original version. I love it to bits. However, a different version of this track would be interesting. Something along the lines of the studio sessions for TLOTWTC."
themountaingoats,3auecr,Staals,7,Tue Jun 23 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"Well, tMG have been Hi-Fi for more than ten years now, and they've become quite big in recent years. John Green or not, a large percentage of new fans is going to think their whole discography is like the Sunset Tree or BtC, and then they suddenly end up with Ghana or Sweden and think ""Wtf, this wasn't the band I was listening to"". It's an understandable reflex, but it doesn't really have to do with JG, does it?"
themountaingoats,3auecr,_Affexion_,3,Tue Jun 23 16:43:11 2015 UTC,"I was the same way. It took me a solid year to even try getting into the LoFi stuff, but now I just wouldn't want it any other way (excluding live of course)"
themountaingoats,3auecr,Turdsworth,3,Tue Jun 23 17:40:04 2015 UTC,Best way to get in to lo-fi is All Hail West Texas because it's transitional and less jarring.

themountaingoats,3auecr,QDefenestration,7,Wed Jun 24 19:45:48 2015 UTC,"I was linked tmg by a friend. I respect jon green {I just don't dig him, his work} but how many people really get into them because of him?   I listen to a ton of low fi stuff, {Like my one of my favourite early dylan albums is the witmark demos, you can hear the tapes and coughing and the piano} so it was so easy to go from their studio stuff to their lo-fi stuff.   It baffles me to no end that people keep asking them to re-record their old stuff. You would not ask that of any other band. You might get something remastered, but that takes the charm away.  The whirling tapes and the raw energy of the early stuff is great. But it is not for everyone.   But if you can not listen to them, you cant expect someone to re-record them for that reason. They are played live, and clean. Listen to that."
themountaingoats,3auecr,Xamnam,4,Tue Jun 23 18:39:12 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. It took me forever to really get to a place where I could enjoy the LoFi stuff.

But there's still a small part of me crying out for a full band studio version of Sinaloan Milk Snake Song and it won't be silenced.

themountaingoats,3auecr,Naxek,2,Wed Jun 24 02:46:38 2015 UTC,"You know, I see both sides of this one. On the one hand, I think it's clear that the low fidelity of those recordings was an artistic choice. In many cases, I think it's also clear that that choice adds something really special to the songs. On the other hand, TMG has been doing awesome live shows since the beginning, which somehow managed to kick ass without the signature lowfi tape hiss. I'd argue that ""best ever death metal band"" is better live, in part because you can pick up so many subtle nuances that are just lost on the lowfi album.  And even if TMG did choose to do a hifi re-release of some early songs, worst case we'd just have 2 versions of some songs, and could continue listening to the lowfi version if it truly is better.   That said, of course, JD doesn't owe us his time and energy just because some fans think it would be neat. Ultimately it's his art and his life, so it has to be his call. Though there's nothing stopping some enterprising band from covering these songs in hifi. I'd definitely but that album."

themountaingoats,3av68m,_Affexion_,2,Tue Jun 23 21:18:41 2015 UTC,"with the comma it looks like you said sorry, hot sorry  Which I think should become a turn of phrase. If only I could figure out what it meant.  Also, seriously how don't you get the warm fuzzies from ""The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you And that you are standing in the doorway""? That may have actually been the first tMG lyric that ever knocked the wind completely out of me."
themountaingoats,3av68m,CatMadeOfFur,2,Thu Jun 25 03:40:18 2015 UTC,"We will make this a thing. Hot sorry.   Story time. Because I know why others don't like it. It is a amazing song with such strong lyrics. So I lived up and down the east coast, but for about four years I lived in a small  town in Florida right next to Amish. Now this was amazing because it was quiet, they are chill cats. The biggest fuss they made was about the mounted cops.   We moved to Atlanta {well right outside of Atlanta, by like 30-40 minutes} and if one could get culture shock by moved just a state away, it happened.   At first it was ok, It was hilly and cool, and everyone seemed nice. Well it did not last. We got some neighbours, who ended up moving out and on Christmas, the father killed everyone in the next flatblock. That was the first Christmas. It could have been next to us had they not moved them for reasons unbeknownst to us.  Soon the gunshots were a common nose,  was it in out block or in the one next to us? The duck and cover for hours became a pop your head out the door. Soon you never called. A whole lot of other stuff went on. That would drag this out.  But the great thing, really amazing thing about darnielles' lyrics are that you can hear one thing, me another and we can feel something totally different.   It is an emotion I can not put my finger on, Like no good can come of this, or  I can not turn away from this train wreak. This beautiful train-wreck*. Then it is kinda madding, because dude, why would you take your broken colt to your girlfriends house.   *The song again is not a a train-wreck, but the story could have taken a million and one different turns."
themountaingoats,3av68m,Xamnam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:03:34 2015 UTC,"I don't hate the song, but I think it suffered from hype backlash for me. I got into the more recent stuff, fell in love love love with it all, kept hearing about Going to Georgia, finally listened to it, and went, ""Well, I mean, I enjoyed it, yes, but..."""
themountaingoats,3av68m,tastyprawn,7,Thu Jun 25 11:44:50 2015 UTC,"I just can't get into ""Love Love Love.""   But, up until recently when I started seeing a part of my life in the lines And then Cathy showed up and we hung out / Trading swigs from a bottle, all bitter and clean / Locking eyes, holding hands / Twin high maintenance machines, I didn't care that much for ""This Year."" So maybe I just haven't yet had that moment that makes ""Love Love Love"" click with me."
themountaingoats,3av68m,catamorphism,14,Tue Jun 23 20:08:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't get ""Love Love Love"" and then I found this interview:   ""Questions That I Fear,"" chapter one. The point of the song is, you know, that we are fairly well damaged by the legacy of the Romantic poets--that we think of love as this, you know, thing that is accompanied by strings and it's a force for good, and if something bad happens then that's not love. And the therapeutic tradition that I come from--I used to work in therapy--you know, also says that it's not love if it feels bad. I don't know so much about that. I don't know that the Greeks weren't right. I think they were--that love can eat a path through everything--that it will destroy a lot of things on the way to its own objective, which is just its expression of itself, you know. I mean, my stepfather loved his family, right? Now he mistreated us terribly quite often, but he loved us. And, you know, well, that to me is something worth commenting on in the hopes of undoing a lot of what I perceive as terrible damage in the way people talk about this--love is this benign, comfortable force. It's not that. It's wild, you know?   And then I cried a lot and I haven't been the same since. If you don't get it, well, it's like ""No Children"": be glad you don't."

The worst part was a few weeks before my husband left me, I was listening to Tallahassee and ""No Children"" came on and he started listening and was inquiring about what it meant, he story behind it, all of that...

Fault Lines and The Mess Inside are okay and I find Fault Lines entertaining, but I think a lot of other tMG songs (including on that album) have captured the same things much better."
themountaingoats,3av68m,descole0,2,Tue Jun 23 20:38:30 2015 UTC,The 4 songs you mentioned are some of my all-time favourites...
themountaingoats,3av68m,bmbz,2,Tue Jun 23 22:40:12 2015 UTC,That's what I love about tMG! There are just SO many songs with SO many meanings that we can all love something about it unconditionally that has nothing to do with why others love it just as much.
themountaingoats,3av68m,_Affexion_,2,Wed Jun 24 01:21:13 2015 UTC,"One thing about Fault Lines and The Mess Inside is I'm not that into the ""we're spending all this money but it doesn't help with what really matters"" angle. I'm more into Balance's ""figuring the interest on delinquent loans"". On the other hand, Fault Lines works well as a lead-in to Balance."
themountaingoats,3av68m,catamorphism,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:09:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's crazy... I love that concept. I love the notion that there are two people who are completely aware that they're not truly in love anymore but want to be, and realise all this money should be making them so happy, because they're living perfectly... but it just doesn't. I love how desperate they sound and how confessional the songs are."
themountaingoats,3av68m,_Affexion_,3,Wed Jul 1 22:31:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know how popular either of these is, but I can't get into ""Sept 15, 1983"" or ""The Autopsy Garland"". In both cases, I know what the story is about, on the surface, I just haven't found the thing that makes it really gut-wrenching yet. In both cases, I know it's there. I just can't see it...  I also can't get into a lot of Tallahassee as much as some people do because it's so detached compared to what comes right after."
themountaingoats,3av68m,eigensheep,3,Tue Jun 23 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on Tallahassee. It's a really great album, but a lot of people treat it like it's a perfect album and I don't think it compares to some of the things that came after it."
themountaingoats,3av68m,redforfilth,2,Wed Jun 24 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"I have no life experience to make Tallahassee hit so hard for me, but it is my favorite album easily. I think it's just a testament to how good the songwriting is. That being said, I completely understand when people don't like it as much as I do."
themountaingoats,3av68m,Dr_Jaffa,2,Thu Jun 25 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"Is there a ""story"" to The Autopsy Garland? I that song hit me hard, but for terrible terrible reasons.   Be happy about Tallahassee. That is not an album you want to relate to. If I ever leave my current b/f I'm leaving that album as a note. That is not a fun place to be."
themountaingoats,3av68m,Xamnam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:54:18 2015 UTC,"I'm divorced, so I do relate to Tallahassee. With the exception of No Children, though, most of the songs are written with enough distance from the characters (first person or not) that it feels like you're not really supposed to like them. With pretty much every album later than that, I can like most of the characters in the songs.  The Autopsy Garland is about the death of Judy Garland, but with most of tMG's songs about famous people, you get a sense that the narrator identifies with that person in some way. With this one, I'm not sure where the connection is. It feels like someone detached from the story is telling it (unlike with, e.g., Luna, Song for Dana Plato, Tyler Lambert's Grave), but I'm probably missing something."
themountaingoats,3av68m,Xamnam,2,Thu Jun 25 05:01:02 2015 UTC,To me The Autopsy Garland is about the darker side of distinguished people. How the people that seem the most upstanding are often the most evil.
themountaingoats,3av68m,Xamnam,3,Thu Jun 25 05:44:49 2015 UTC,"I've never really been able to get into Birth of Serpents. The ""uninvited guest"" line is brilliant, but the rest of the song just doesn't do a whole lot for me, even though John said it's one of his most personal songs."

The only versions of those songs that I can listen to are more recent live versions of Color In Your Cheeks or Best Ever Death Metal Band."
themountaingoats,3av68m,Xamnam,3,Wed Jun 24 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"I hear nothing but praise for High Hawk Season, and I can appreciate the talent, but it just seems so out of place.  Honestly, and I recognize that it may get me castigated here, All Eternal's Deck was kind of disappointing as a whole.   Others: Until I am Whole, In Memory of Satan, Stabbed to Death Outside San Juan, Dinu Lipatti's Bones.  And while I wouldn't say it's exactly popular, Blues in Dallas is arguably my least favorite tMG song of all time. It wouldn't bother me so much if it didn't break up the otherwise seamless AHWT."
themountaingoats,3av68m,_Affexion_,2,Wed Jun 24 20:22:56 2015 UTC,What are your favorite tMG songs? I'm just curious because you named a lot of the songs I enjoy.
themountaingoats,3av68m,311TruthMovement,2,Wed Jun 24 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"Isn't that always the case with these threads? You can guarantee what ever song is is that you hate/love, someone feels the opposite way.   Off the top of my head, and in no particular order: TBEDMBiD, Jenny, Autoclave, Game Shows Touch Our Lives, Matthew 25:21, Fall of the High School Running Back, Werewolf Gimmick, Have to Explode, Oceanographer's Choice, Waving at You, Wild Sage, Deuteronomy 2:10.  That list would easily change by tomorrow, but those are all way up there for me. Top 3 albums would be Tallahassee, AHWT, and Heretic Pride."
themountaingoats,3av68m,Xamnam,2,Wed Jun 24 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"And my top 3 would be tLatWtC, All Eternals Deck, and The Sunset Tree, with Beat the Champ and AHWTX fighting for a spot. Just started trying to really to Heretic Pride this week and.. so far it reminds me a lot of AED so I think its interesting how you feel about those. After I feel like I ""get"" Heretic Pride I'm gonna tackle Get Lonely, and hopefully never fully ""get"" it."
themountaingoats,3av68m,311TruthMovement,2,Wed Jun 24 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"Life of the World to Come is waaaaay up there for me, doing the brackets helped me realize that.   I can objectively recognize that there are some similarities between AED and Heretic Pride, but whatever reason, the former just don't click as much for me. Not that they're bad, just not as good as I hoped for. Maybe some day.   Get Lonely is wonderful, but it's definitely fitting for the title, so make sure you're in the right mood for it. Wild Sage, Moon Over Goldsboro, Maybe Sprout Wings, Woke Up New, and In Corrolla have all garnered my obsession at some point or another."
themountaingoats,3av68m,descole0,3,Wed Jun 24 22:10:39 2015 UTC,"The studio version of High Hawk Season, I can not get into the barbershop feel of the backing vocals.

themountaingoats,3auio9,mouse_skeleton,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:26:02 2015 UTC,"found a review i did for someone before  Fields Of Our Home - strong opener, lost it's appeal to me with the harmonies, maybe a bit too much reverb, but calm acoustics  Darkness Of The Dream -  energetic but too long, vocals lost in mix  Singers - very nice, vocals at a good level, nice words, some of the added instruments don't add much, sounds a bit off in place with them, the violin is a nice touch though.  Slow Dance's good, one of the strongest. sounds sorta like King Of Spain, track two I think had an intro similar to the gardener, you'd think he'd have less similar sounding songs than most due to all the different tunings etc. but good mix, great words (which is what he DOES and shouldn't be lost anywhere), nothing felt outta place  Little Nowhere Towns -five - great song, highlight here though is the harmony parts, pianos too fast and he doesn't seem to suit the instrument, mostly superficial I don't like that! but kinda puts the track down for me  Sagres - same as when I first listened, vox lost, but not entirely... sounds very mumfords&sons-y, really energetic pop kinda stuff, nice one to listen to without focusing too hard, so far can see why this was the single for the album  Timothy - Very nice, everything has its place, he's really trying his hands at the ohohohohoho parts isn't he? - best part: energetic strumming during the line ""Why are you so complicated?"" probably favorite of the bunch  Beginners - very nice, classic sounding tmoe, everything slowly brought in, nice transitional track to this new sounding material, would've maybe used this as a single, possibly before sagres, replacing any highlight I had so far as the hit of the herd.  Seventeen - went from 0 to fuck you very quick. Nice sound, similar to sagres in its hey I'm the new mumford and sons attitude. Another one to listen with little or no focus required.  Dark bird is home - I think I did hear this one already. It's ok. It's whatever. Its main feature is the little riff he does the odd time, nothing special at all. Riff even gets annoying. 2/10  give it overall, 4.2452423245"

There's also a certain amount of sadness in it, though it's more hidden than it is in a lot of tMG songs.  They also had in common with early tMG the sense that these are people who just really need to make music and aren't being held back by somebody else's standards of what's ""good"".

Just knowing other people who have been touched by TMG is something else because John's music can literally relate to anyone. It's like everyone who listens to TMG is bound into a community because they know how life-changing they can be.  idk, maybe that sounds pretentious or silly but the meanings in John's songs truly are incredible.  As for me though, Amy aka Spent Gladiator made me realize that failure is okay through some truly ""flawless"" logic of mine."

themountaingoats,3arukx,kidsoftheblackhole,2,Tue Jun 23 18:49:44 2015 UTC,"IMO ""Damn These Vampires"" ends with the realization that the vampires are who you see when you look in the mirror.  Someone asked John why ""Steal Smoked Fish"" ends with ""God bless all vampires"" in contrast with damning them, and he said that that was because he wrote ""Steal Smoked Fish"" as who he was in 2012, and ""Damn These Vampires"" from the perspective of someone who he was years before that. (Can't remember where this was, I'm paraphrasing.)  I really like that.  Edit: Here's what I was referring to:  https://twitter.com/jrdkirk/status/590729729680011267  ""(the direct answer is that the damning speaker is me in 1986. the blessing speaker is the person I became.)"""
themountaingoats,3arukx,kidsoftheblackhole,4,Tue Jun 23 18:20:05 2015 UTC,"Oh boy.  I feel like tMG helped me learn/realize/come to terms with many different aspects of myself, so I'll just talk about my favorite realization.  It was the first one.  Several years ago I had gotten out of an abusive relationship, and as is common with these kinds of things, it took me years to really process and recover from it.  Maybe four years ago, I listened to my first tMG song.  No Children.  I'd never heard anything like it.  It was so bitter and furious and unapologetically angry.  It was a release of pressure, to feel that burden shared.    After hearing that, I found myself picking up songs piecemeal as they came across my path online.  Broom People.  Up The Wolves.  This Year.  I categorized it as spite music.  It's not hard to see why.  ""And I hope we hang on past the last exit / I hope it's already too late.""  ""I am going to make it through this year if it kills me."" ""It's going to take you people years to recover from all of the damage.""  It became my new favorite genre.  To me, doing things out of spite has always been categorized as something bad.  TMG made me realize that sometimes, doing things out of spite is what you have in your arsenal of tools, and you can use that spite for good.  You can hear yourself saying ""I can't do this, I'd look like an idiot, they wouldn't love me anymore, I can't do it, I shouldn't even try,"" and think.  Well.  Fuck that.  Fuck you, self-doubt!  Fuck you, imagined fears!  I'll do it anyway.  And I'll be proud of that.  That method of ""fearlessness"" has come in handy so many times.  I'm so glad I've embraced it."

themountaingoats,3ai134,catamorphism,4,Sun Jun 21 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"I was upset too when I first saw her Twitter feed. Hell, I'm still kind of upset...  I come from abuse, but it was just my mom and me growing up, so I never had any hope that anyone besides me was going to corroborate what she did to me (not that I even remember most of it, but that's how it usually goes). As a kid, I used to fantasize that if I had a sibling, we'd team up against our common enemy. As an adult, of course, I know that's not always what happens -- that often, one or more siblings in a family will side with the abuser even if they've all seen/experienced more or less the same stuff.  It must be so hard for John to have the one person who ought to back him up, who was there, deny it and attack him for being open about his experiences. I can't even imagine. I'm sad for him, but also for myself, because it's a reminder that as a kid when I hoped for a witness, I hoped for something that, on its own, wouldn't have necessarily have made it better.  At the same time, I have to be at least a little sad for her too, because you know that anyone who's that deep into denial and that ready to lash out at others who are less in denial must have gone through some seriously awful things herself."

themountaingoats,3ai134,311TruthMovement,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:29:11 2015 UTC,"Looking at her twitter feed, I was thinking this is more an obsessed fan with a serious problem who had created this persona. But…there's old pictures, and it does seem to check out. I really hope no more TMG fans try to engage her, though. She has as much right to her story as JD does, and I think she understandably feels like her truth is always going to be stomped on by JD's.  EDIT: There's still something very off about this…there's no way to explain the old photos without sounding crazy and conspiratorial about the haxx0rz, but here's an example of something I find odd: you get a general voice going for her, lots of misspellings of very basic words, and then a reply like ""least I got u a dm from ur guru the goat too bad his fingers aren't really on the pulse of humanity."" There's something about that that feels very much like breaking voice. There's the many RTs from Rumi, the stuff about boxing…it all feels very expository, like ""I must certainly be this person because I know so very much about John Darnielle and his interests."" Her last name is still Darnielle, because how else would we know that it's definitely very much his real sister?  I'm probably wrong and this is actually his sister, but I also think everyone should be a bit skeptical.  EDIT2: A good reason for why she might be going after JD now, at this specific time: Used to Haunt is going to be on a movie's soundtrack and that looks like dollar signs. Combine that with her anger that she's expressing about JD not caring for their mother and the likely costs involved with that and there's a pretty clear motive. Perhaps her hope is he'll pay her off to shut up?"

I know he doesn't get any benefit from releasing the song, but is it really okay to remove the only source of the song from the internet?  Now anyone who is interested in listening to Used to haunt will have to wait to buy the soundtrack or wait until someone uploads it again without John's permission.  And furthermore, why doesn't Will just remove all his Mountain Goats songs and not just Used to Haunt if John isn't giving his blessing.  Just my two cents."
themountaingoats,3ai134,catamorphism,5,Sat Jun 20 23:37:08 2015 UTC,By waiting for the soundtrack to come out and buying the soundtrack. You can make it through the next 20 days if it kills you.  The reason John asked for this one to be removed is that it's on an album that's about to be released. The other ones aren't. Presumably.

She always marched to the beat of her own drum and didn't give a fuck what other people said to her, to be honest I had a huge crush on her. But I was afraid, I couldn't approach this girl. She was the punk and I was the jock, what the hell would people think. I was so caught up in my own image and what other people would think that I let any opportunity I ever had slip through my fingers.

I can think of two other bands that scratch the same itch for me as TMG and front bottoms: neutral milk hotel and the Andrew Jackson jihad. They both embrace similar themes: soaring, prosaic lyrics in the service of a message which is simultaneously nihilistic and defiant, and so god damn fun. And I don't know if it's a coincidence, but they are all so very nasal.  Maybe there's just something about the aesthetic of these bands that you couldn't achieve with a more traditionally beautiful voice. Imagine Freddy Mercury doing the hail-satans from ""Best ever death metal band"" or Josh Groban singing ""I have this dream that I am hitting my dad with a baseball bat.""  It's like to sing about dirty places and broken people, you need a dirty broken voice. It's oddly similar to grunge, except no one is pretending to be tough."

I don't even like John Green's books and probably won't see this movie despite the soundtrack, but...dude. You can't call a respected advocate of feminism sexist, then call his supporters sexist, then call men sexist, then act like all the people who disagree with you are some bizarre minority that fell out of sky, based on essentially no evidence. No, you're the minority, because you're taking generalization and team-oriented black and white thinking to an unnecessary extreme.  edit: and yeah I know this is just fueling the fire, but I mean come on.

themountaingoats,3a1qy1,CatMadeOfFur,10,Tue Jun 16 23:49:59 2015 UTC,"/r/themountaingoats is one of the most accepting Reddit communities around. I've never seen any aggressive, disrespectful, or tasteless posts in here before and the people you're talking with are common posters on here.    You might want to reread some of your comments because you strongly indicate that you believe a book you haven't read is sexist, people on here are sexist, in general certain males have to be sexist by default, and now members of a very fun and loving community are MRA advocates (which if you were accused of being one, you probably wouldn't like it).    I can't really point to any user here being aggressive towards you, other than disagreeing with the fact that a book that you haven't read is sexist.  When they disagreed with you, you jumped to saying it was a knee-jerk defense of white CIS men, which came out of nowhere and, understandably, led to some people disagreeing with you a little more.  You're treating others here like enemies when a place like this couldn't be farther from the truth.  We're here to get along and find some joy together, not attack each other."

themountaingoats,3a1qy1,lightningrod14,8,Tue Jun 16 23:30:19 2015 UTC,"To a lot of people, the idea that a book can endanger someone simply by being read is a strange concept.  I don't think they considered the idea that reading Fault of Our Stars would put you in a bad place, especially when they don't see it as sexist.  I don't mean to insult you or cause you harm, but disagreement about an opinion, especially when people aren't being aggressively insulting or inflammatory, is healthy and not meant to be piling on.  You responded to the disagreement by throwing around that people here are MRA advocates, which can be taken as a slight or insult.  Look over the comments again.  Nobody is attacking you, insulting you, etc... they just disagree with the idea that a specific book is in anyway sexist.  Considering Fault of Our Stars is a coming of age book that has helped a lot of people get through rough times or discover themselves, and its author has led to a big surge in Mountain Goats fans, dismissing it as sexist without any knowledge of it is going to cause some disagreement (and perhaps some hurt because you're attacking their ""Chavo Guerrero"")."

This is from a woman. But that is your opinion. I can not take that from you. This is also not relevant to anything.  I don't think it matters about jon greens personal life, if he puts out good work and people like it then he is a better person then me. There are many a author who had unflattering personal lives yet people ate their work up. characters who were unflattering people and yet, the books sold. Fro what I know of green is that he is a rad dude, and trouble follows. Such is life.   The equivalent of what you did to people trying to talk to you was bring a knife to a fist fight.

Alternatively, you can stop behaving like a child and accept that the world isn't always partitioned into people who you agree with and people who are wrong. Part of growing up is accepting that you're not always right, and opinions and beliefs that don't match with yours are not always wrong.

themountaingoats,3a1qy1,bigatoms,-4,Tue Jun 16 17:43:24 2015 UTC,"Who said anything about Tumblr? (Anyway, Tumblr is a broadly used web site -- this is like saying someone is a target of ""The Internet"".)  I haven't read the book, but given that no matter how sexist a book is, you can always find someone who thinks it's not, given that structural misogyny is a thing, this isn't really giving me any new info. And I have plenty of books on my to-read list that I don't have any reason to think are particularly sexist, so none of that is likely to change."
themountaingoats,3a1qy1,descole0,9,Tue Jun 16 17:45:05 2015 UTC,"no matter how sexist a book is, you can always find someone who thinks it's not   This logic works the other way around too. Even if a book isn't sexist, there might be some people who interpret it as being sexist.  If you don't want to read the book or follow John Green, that's obviously fine. But without reading it, you can't call it sexist based on what someone else said."
themountaingoats,3a1qy1,iGoByManyNames,-1,Tue Jun 16 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it is sexist, but I do prefer to spend my limited reading time on authors I don't think will make me feel worse.  That's all i'm saying, and had someone not basically expressed surprise about my lack of knowledge of his work, I wouldn't have said that much.  Then the conversation strayed into knee-jerk defense of a white cis het man for existing, and that pattern is always toxic and it harms people no matter how great the work under discussion might be. I care about that because that pattern makes communities worse and less healthy."
themountaingoats,3a1qy1,christophollis,9,Tue Jun 16 20:15:35 2015 UTC,"strayed into knee-jerk defense of a white cis het man for existing   It wasn't to anyone's defense simply ""for existing"", and it wasn't knee-jerk, it was because you called him and his book sexist. If someone calls me sexist, or someone whose work I follow and who shows no signs in the slightest of being sexist, that deserves a defense.  If someone started saying John Darnielle is sexist and everything you know points to the contrary you're not going to say anything? Or simply because people accused him of being sexist are you going to (as you did with John Green's book) accept that as fact and stop listening to the Mountain Goats?"

When I first came across tMG it was the music that really hooked me, I loved the lyrics and how much they dug straight to my core, more than any other bands I'd come across. As I became fully invested in the band, I came across John's writings online, his interviews and such, and it just got better and better. John's eloquence, his confidence and the way he treated people and just life in general... it was something I could really, really aspire to. Everyone's late teens are intense and weird, and JD clearly knew all about that, so every time he said things got better and the bad things would never beat you I really believed him. I still believe him. He's still a reliable source of good words and motivation."

If we have to say somebody whose existence we knew about when we were literally children, then I guess I'd pick two fictional characters, Lisa Simpson and Anastasia Krupnik. Fictional characters seemed like a better bet than any real people in my life until I was about 15. For a non-fictional character, maybe Doug Marlette, the late editorial cartoonist (I read his book In Your Face when I was 11 or 12 and it had a big influence on me -- I wanted to be a cartoonist for a while until somebody punished me for dreaming my dream) or, embarrassingly, Bill Clinton (he was who was a big deal when I first started paying attention to politics).

She had to help raise her younger siblings, but she still completed school with honors and went to nursing school. She was also a musician and worked as a DJ at a radio station in the town she lived in. She got married, had three children, and then her husband passed away so she had to raise three kids as a single mother in the early '60s. She later remarried and had two more children, though her oldest son from her first marriage and her new husband really did not like each other, yet she managed to keep the peace between them. She is what held the family together. She passed away of cancer in '99 and that was so damn rough on me and my family has not been the same since (I have two uncles I never see anymore-- one has disappeared and we only know he's alive because every once in awhile he will attempt to use one of my other uncles' names to conduct business). I'm glad I got to know her for the time I did, but I wish she were still around.   As an adult, it is John Darnielle.

I found dylan coming out of middle school {though, I am certain I heard him before}. In school it never really helps if you do anything different, or even look a bit different. Even now, I get people at me for buying dylan or folk or the like. I remember a sort-kinda friend I sat next to in maths getting so irate with me because I had music for me, things that I enjoyed and not stuff that were for other people. I guess that is a thing. She would ask me where stuff from the top of the pops where, dislike the fact that I had not heard any of them and shove back my music.  Bob dylan could not spell, for love nor money, his handwriting was illegible. It was everyday for years I got comments on how bad my handwriting was, I had got it down to where it was legible, but so very tiny. I never understood it, it just happened, it worked for me. No one said anything. One day, I got berated for twenty minutes about this. It was around this time I did stop caring about my handwriting.   Bob dylan just did him. He did what pleased him. If people did not like that, in the end it was their opinion. I could go on for another two or three paragraphs about how in highschool I shaped some ideology and philosophy around dylans lack of care that suited me.  You hear all the same things, the movies where everyone ends on a happy note, etc etc. I did not fall into this box. No one ever had a box for me. I was ok with this, a outlander.  Bob dylan is the same way.   Kubrick has been my fall back. There doesn't need to be a reason for anything in his movies. He just does it because he can. I have found a trend with people I look up to and it is this. If I am in a uppity mood, His cinematography gets me, If I am down, The score, and just the mood of the movie, it is something to keep my mind on a linear path. To avoid dwelling on anything.   And the ever small list goes on to include Phil ochs, Nico, Bela lugosi, and Joan baez"

When I was a really young kid, I watched Mythbusters all the time and I loved it (still do, the new season is SUPER great). For me, he's one of the coolest dudes, especially since I discovered Tested and got to see all the material with him in his workshop etc.  And the other side of this coin is Alton Brown from Good Eats. He's very much like Adam Savage, except he's culinarily focused. Still, he's got the great humor and science, two big staples between Adam Savage and Alton Brown.  Now, for me they're not much like Chavo was for John, I feel like I never really had that exact experience, but they're definitely really cool people who I've inspired to emulate since I was a very young child.  Now, those are the non-musical answers. My musical answers are Ozzy Osbourne (the actual Prince of Darkness, excuse you /u/iGoByManyNames ), Simon and Garfunkel, Peter, Mike, Mickey and Davy from the Monkees, and Weird Al Yankovic.

As some of the photos suggest, it was raining off and on when I did this drive (last Sunday, on my way to the Dallas show... no, it was not the most direct route from Tucson). At the beginning, while I was still in Jeff Davis County itself, it was raining so hard for a while (on a questionable road surface) that I was worried about spinning out. It all felt pretty fitting to the mood of the song, though, all 18 live versions of which I took the opportunity to listen to while driving."
themountaingoats,39lmvb,tastyprawn,3,Fri Jun 12 19:39:51 2015 UTC,"It is so cool that you made this trip en route to the Dallas show. I hear that show was excellent.  The first day I was in the area the weather was pretty bad. I was in a tent during a tornado watch and experienced a hail storm (All Hail West Texas, indeed!) which was terrifying, but the second day everything cleared up and it was beautiful. I'm glad to hear that area is still getting rain because they need it, but I'm sorry to hear it was happening as you were driving... Though it does really fit with the mood of the song!  Edit: Bonus picture I took of one of the Jeff Davis County signs as the sky darkened. I wish I could have gotten some shots of the lightning that was happening behind it, but it started getting closer and I thought ""Hm, maybe I should go seek shelter..."""

I thought it would run away before I could take a picture, but it froze.  (That line, by the way, might be my favorite one in the song. That the narrator is so distanced from their own feelings that they're not even sure if they're panicking? Took me a while to notice that detail but once I did the song got to be even more gut-punching for me.)"

On the up side, very little traffic the entire way. You would want to be prepared for short intense rain storms if you do the trip in the summer. Probably early spring or late fall would be best - last weekend, anyway, it was hot. Also on the up side, pretty flat (though what seems flat in a car isn't always on a bike!) And you would probably want to either have someone pick you up in Midland or be prepared to catch a bus or something (not sure what if any bus or train stations are close to where I started - Van Horn, TX just off I-10 - either). Doing this as a loop trip would make it much longer.  Oh, also I assumed you meant bicycle rather than motorcycle :)"
themountaingoats,39lmvb,binary,2,Fri Jun 12 23:15:22 2015 UTC,"Yes! Bicycle indeed! I noticed some pretty good shoulders in the pictures you took... But pictures can be deceiving and often times you don't pay attention to the shoulders when you're driving.  And I've usually found it to be the case that if you think it's flat in a car then it's at least bearable by bike. If you think it's hilly... You're in for a rough rise.  I'll have to look into transport to get there.. But I'll probably be stuck driving.  I live in Kansas so it's a doable drive... Just perhaps not the most pleasant.  If I can talk someone into riding down with me I'll start in Toyahvale... If not I'll start in midland and do a loop down to Toyahvale and then follow the route to Midland so that I can be ""coming back to Midland""."

Lots of others that I disagree with in that vein. John's straight up said that Animal Mask is a song about a battle royale, and a song about a child being born in the delivery room, and all of that comes through loud as day.   Still, an interesting analysis."
themountaingoats,39bcxi,abluecolor,4,Fri Jun 12 01:05:47 2015 UTC,"I find the most obvious misinterpretation there to be ""Luna"" -- JD has said it's about Luna Vachon and it's hard to argue that the song isn't from her perspective. The author of this review doesn't seem to know that, and the assumption that all narrators are male bugs me since JD has explicitly said he writes both songs with female narrators, and songs where the narrator is gender-ambiguous.  I like far-fetched interpretations, but when an interpretation just contradicts the text outright, that's kind of boring, you know? Along those lines, IMO ""Animal Mask"" is also about the struggle within one person as to which persona is going to guide that person's sense of self, and how somebody might adopt a persona that isn't entirely true to them in order to survive. And to me, that doesn't contradict the birth and battle-royale readings of it, since those are both apt metaphors for internal conflict and change."

The performance of Stabbed to Death outside San Juan corrected one of the lyric problems that bugs the Hell out of me every time I listen hahaha. Maybe Sprout Wings and Never Quite Free were amazing, as usual.

I'm crossing my fingers for Ballad of Bull Ramos or Choked Out, and would probably ascend to a new state of existence if You Were Cool or Best Ever made the setlist, but they could sing grocery lists and I would be fine with it.

I think part of what got me into geography was my desire to keep finding new places so I could run from my depression for a bit, even though my depression had a lot more to do with me than my surroundings; I think John said somewhere that that's the unifying theme of the Going To songs, actually.

themountaingoats,38gjrj,binary,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:53:57 2015 UTC,"I grabbed the black/white one because it had the tour dates and looked cool. Might grab a ""I only listen to the mountain goats"" one online that I can wear semi-ironically"

The forums had a major downgrade for some reason or another recently and you can't post links, images, etc. anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if this was part of that. Keep trying to create an account and if that doesn't work out, maybe try to figure out from the tMG website who is in charge of it and email them?

themountaingoats,386vks,charliepark,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:18:02 2015 UTC,"Well, largely it's because I can't think of a better candidate. But also a pencil seems like a pretty solid foreign object with which to stab someone in the eye."

themountaingoats,386vks,descole0,3,Tue Jun 2 15:49:28 2015 UTC,Pretty sure 20 is The Best Ever Death Metal Band In Denton.
themountaingoats,386vks,lagaard,2,Tue Jun 2 16:53:44 2015 UTC,Fair point... but then what is #9?
themountaingoats,386vks,Dirty_Tleilaxu,3,Tue Jun 2 17:14:45 2015 UTC,"I figured that was the ""black velvet altarcloth / white chalk Baphomet"" from Cry For Judas."

themountaingoats,386vks,catamorphism,3,Tue Jun 2 17:48:27 2015 UTC,Pretty sure 9 is Cry for Judas? Maybe?
themountaingoats,386vks,gunslingerroland,3,Tue Jun 2 17:02:59 2015 UTC,18 could also be Werewolf Gimmick.

themountaingoats,384lod,Naxek,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:16:48 2015 UTC,"Darnielle: It varies from album to album. It depends. And it’s funny because when you get your first song, for one, you sort of know. It’s like, oh, that feels like something a little different. Often there’s some space between records where you don’t feel like you’re on any path. It’s not like your album is some radical departure, but usually there’s a little something that opens up that feels like a different path. But on this one, the first one I wrote was “Till I’m Whole,” and it was really dark. It was a super dark song with a lot of death in it. And I thought, “Wow that’s pretty good, that’s very bleak.” And then the next one, the same two-day stay at the hotel, was explicitly about schizophrenia, so I had a little pocket of two there. The first thing I was thinking about was, “Oh a seven-inch!” But I also think it’s really dangerous to immediately announce the theme to yourself.  Stereogum: Because then it becomes a guiding concept, whether you want it to or not?  Darnielle: When you have that then you have people writing songs where they’ve decided that the action is going to move from New York to Hoboken, so they have one song where they take the ferry to Hoboken, and it’s so visibly moving the narrative along, and you sort of want it to develop naturally. I’m lucky — it doesn’t take me too long to get my stuff together. I’m generally able to work from a spontaneous place.   While I'm sure he could do something great with it, I think he'd be wary of going that route unless he felt he could get at something new about them.   Or he might just get really excited about Sabbath again. Who can say?  But, I'd also refer to this:   stillborninlove asked: please tell me you're naming your next album The Excellence of the Possum. of any work of art you create next. please.  People always say this about good Twitter jokes but one of my few iron-clad rules for living is “if I made a joke on Twitter or Tumblr, that was the appropriate venue for that joke, and attempting to port it into some other mode of expression would be funny for maybe half a minute, after which half-minute it would enter Dad Zone and bear the mark of Dad Zone for all its days”  Dad Zone is a great place to be in one’s personal life but is a terrible look in album titles  that is my word on this proposed album title but I stand by the hashtag"

One big thing with TMG is you've got a lot of banter, and I would suggest doing one of two things: leaving it at the end of previous songs rather than at the beginning of the songs they're about, or making banter >15 seconds its own track."

themountaingoats,37kqey,FreeAsCheap,1 point,Fri May 29 02:16:34 2015 UTC,"If it's less than 15 seconds or so, it might feel unnecessary to make it its own track. It really depends on each individual case, but I agree with you, interesting banter that goes on for more than a few seconds should be its own track. I think if it's tedious, like JD thanking people, then it belongs at the end of the previous track. Need a flowchart here :)"
themountaingoats,37kqey,FreeAsCheap,2,Fri May 29 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I just think that banter about a song should go on the track of the song it's about, whether it is before the song, or after, if people are interested in keeping the number of tracks down.   Personally, I'm all for keeping banter as a separate track, though. I love me some banter."

I know now that that particular no was powerful enough for others to notice it, and not just me. The stillness the pause created was like the first step off of a building. The quiet.

themountaingoats,37hdej,angelfromthecoast,1 point,Wed May 27 20:55:51 2015 UTC,is this the first time that fire editorial has been played live? i don't remember seeing it at all in the sets for first leg of the tour
themountaingoats,37hdej,lagaard,2,Wed May 27 22:37:42 2015 UTC,"I believe so, yes."
themountaingoats,37hdej,FreeAsCheap,1 point,Wed May 27 22:47:28 2015 UTC,I'm intrigued by the placement of Going to Bolivia outside of the solo set. Did they do a full-band version? (I guess the studio version has bass iirc)
themountaingoats,37hdej,read-my-lips,1 point,Wed May 27 23:08:37 2015 UTC,"They did! Two guitars, one bass, one drum set."
themountaingoats,37hdej,sgshepard,3,Sat May 30 18:43:34 2015 UTC,Denver was a great show.
themountaingoats,37hdej,Mr_Timns,1 point,Wed May 27 23:48:53 2015 UTC,My first show. Amazing and very respectable crowd. I was ready to drive to next show afterwards. How often do they tour?
themountaingoats,37j80a,danny-rauger,1 point,Thu May 28 00:50:29 2015 UTC,I like it! The only problem I have with it is the instrumentals are kinda loud and it sort of covered the vocals a bit too much.  I'd like to hear more covers from you. I think you have potential!
themountaingoats,37j80a,FiftyCentLighter,1 point,Thu May 28 15:31:28 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! It's the first thing I've ever recorded so thanks for the tips. I'm thinking of doing The Recognition Scene next.
themountaingoats,37fc3m,Naxek,3,Wed May 27 05:25:37 2015 UTC,"So tomorrow my partner and I are going on a roadtrip and I was told I could bring along ONE Mountain Goats CD, so this is what I came up with. haha Just wanna hear people's thoughts and maybe share some of your own! (I tried to go for some of the more palatable songs too, except in a few cases.)"
themountaingoats,37fc3m,_Affexion_,5,Wed May 27 05:27:16 2015 UTC,"I have no idea where you are starting or ending (or if you're even in the US), but if you're passing through Central Ohio, I work at a hotel and have a running Mountain Goats fan discount when I'm working."
themountaingoats,37fc3m,descole0,1 point,Wed May 27 16:56:17 2015 UTC,Are you even allowed to do that? Can you just give someone a discount with no real reason?
themountaingoats,37fc3m,_Affexion_,2,Wed May 27 21:21:07 2015 UTC,I can find a reason! The only reason I'm not a manager there yet is because they would have to pay me more.
themountaingoats,37fc3m,_Affexion_,1 point,Thu May 28 03:46:16 2015 UTC,I will definitely keep that offer in mind in the future!
themountaingoats,37fc3m,lightningrod14,2,Wed May 27 23:45:07 2015 UTC,"always! My email is affexion@gmail.com if anybody finds themselves out this way in need of a room, e-mail me and I will tell you the location and brand so I can get you in at a discount!"
themountaingoats,37fc3m,abluecolor,3,Thu May 28 04:01:26 2015 UTC,"I know it's alphabetical by album, but damn if Vampires ain't a great way to start a road trip off."
themountaingoats,37fc3m,willneu97,1 point,Wed May 27 07:56:06 2015 UTC,"It surely is! (It's actually in the order I put songs on there, but because the albums are alphabetical it turned out mostly that way. A few are out of place. :P)"
themountaingoats,37fc3m,eigensheep,2,Wed May 27 08:03:47 2015 UTC,All those but live! Hahaha I just love me some god damned live goats. Excellent playlist imo.

themountaingoats,378j9c,TheManInsideMe,11,Mon May 25 19:19:35 2015 UTC,"I love it too!I think it's because JD writes for the underdogs and for for some people, it's nice to just feel a connection. There's no need for competition and I love it too!"
themountaingoats,378j9c,_Affexion_,9,Mon May 25 21:26:56 2015 UTC,"Especially when you realise that other people just as psyched as you about tMG. It's always a treat to hear how they found out about it, and what kind of path they took through the back catalogue."
themountaingoats,378j9c,Dumptruckfunk,5,Mon May 25 22:42:16 2015 UTC,"It's also really great because people are so open about sharing parts of their music collection. Nobody is looking down on anybody else because they haven't heard X song or because they haven't listened to Y obscure live recording or because they don't have Z album or whatever. And if they don't have these things or haven't heard them, we freely share them, instead of hoarding it all for ourselves.   Sometimes a little kindness is needed in the world, in whatever small form it takes, and I feel like that too, is something that is touched upon again and again in JD's music."
themountaingoats,378j9c,PantsBonanza,2,Mon May 25 22:02:00 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with this statement.  You haven't heard 'Going to Chino'? Here let me play it for you... I Don't have it on my phone, how did that happen? Well, let me and 3 other people sing it for you... but we don't know where it actually starts so we have to start from the beginning of the album and sing the whole thing :)  And I know we just met, but here is my signed copy of 33 1/3 that you can read... Read it and let's talk about/enjoy it together."
themountaingoats,378j9c,DocELB,3,Wed May 27 05:08:14 2015 UTC,"but here is my signed copy of 33 1/3 that you can read   Speaking of, when JD signed my copy, he tore out a part of a page to write my name on so we could put me on the guest list for a show in my hometown that I wasn't able to get tickets to, and as a result had to drive five hours away to go to a show this tour.  I think one of the reasons the fanbase is so nice is because JD himself is such a swell dude."
themountaingoats,378j9c,PantsBonanza,2,Wed May 27 05:20:05 2015 UTC,JD and TMG in general just brings out the best in everyone (besides Get Lonely).
themountaingoats,378j9c,TheAllStarrBand,7,Thu May 28 03:58:04 2015 UTC,"Not just that the fans are nice, supportive and go out their way to help others. /u/dumptruckfunk actually went out of his way to check out a venue for me.  In the words of Rivers Cuomo: ""How cool is that?"""

themountaingoats,378j9c,catamorphism,3,Tue May 26 00:41:16 2015 UTC,"It was only a few days ago but I inquired about the suitability of a venue on UK tour after they had said they lived a minute away. They popped down and checked it out for me, I really appreciated it."
themountaingoats,378j9c,DailySojourn,4,Tue May 26 00:44:20 2015 UTC,"It's not a competition to see who's the biggest fan or who's got the best collection.   This is good, solid wisdom for well-adjusted adults, but we are TMG fans ;) Seriously, though, I think there's a universal human desire, strong in some people, not so much in others, to venture out farther than anyone else has been, to know that you are the first man on the moon or the only one to travel down some tributary of the Amazon and come back with a rare flower. I don't think this is a necessarily bad thing, but I feel ya — watching other people try to gloat about it, it can be agonizing."
themountaingoats,378j9c,PantsBonanza,3,Tue May 26 00:53:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well, I once drove north on Mills Avenue."
themountaingoats,375as5,WhovianJackson,10,Mon May 25 00:27:13 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure 'like' would be the biggest word in any MG album. Dude loves his similes.
themountaingoats,375as5,A_A_lewis_,4,Mon May 25 02:12:56 2015 UTC,Here's a blogpost I wrote about exactly that some months ago. It's in swedish. Sorry.

themountaingoats,375as5,lovelylayout,2,Mon May 25 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see ""pop,"" which is a word that stands out to me at several points on the album. ""Old man Gordy could pop like a live grenade""; ""when I show up just in time to pop you can clear the goddamn floor""; etc. Actually now those are the only two I can remember. Maybe it's not as big a deal as I thought.   Anyway, I like the color scheme. :) Nice job!"
