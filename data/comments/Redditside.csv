I think that most jumps will work under 60fps, too. But they are not as consistent, i.e. they might not work every time. I am currently working on the third part with some Indar bases.

I still follow the game because the concept is great even though the execution was terrible, and probably not helped by SOE greedy behavior.  So I really have no idea what the video is about. I know the Orion is the VS LMG and that's about it.  The thing I hated about that website is that the video was made for ants and the embedded player lacked a full screen mode."

A bunch of heat is generated which attracts a bunch of zombies. The crates can hold traps too like zombies. Its not supposed to be ""home delivery"" service for gear.

You don't get to miss out on an ""oops"" opportunity and then complain that you got screwed. Next time, just wait until after the bundle is supposed to go off sale and see if another oops comes along.  SOE made a few bucks they wouldn't have otherwise.

They recently added deployable auto turrets. It's had a mixed response from the community but I think they're awesome, especially how they subtly use its drawbacks to encourage its proper use without seeming lame - You can only place it once until you resupply and only 1 is active at a time, this makes it only spammable near Sunderers and infantry terminals so Sundie defense is where it shines especially against Light Assaults.  You can run around with your knife out now too. Hold melee or press 8 to switch to it. They added 1hKO knives that have to be activated to deal more damage than the default. It's gotta be equipped then press b to activate, it starts making an empire specific noise people around you can hear. It swings a bit slower with a slight delay when it's activated/equipped or not in order to be balanced with the default. Sounds OP in theory but in practice it really isn't.  They changed knife mechanics hit detection to require more precise use. You now can get headshots with knives (+50% damage to infantry and +100% damage to MAXs when you do it.) Some people have been complaining that hit detection seems ""off"" since the change and it might end up getting reverted."
