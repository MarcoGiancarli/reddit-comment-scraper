learnart,3e3qq5,fredriklars,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:32:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words, it took what felt like forever to finish these.   Did you use specific any specific reference for this?    I just googled photos of different kitchen utensils.   Anything in particular you learned in the process?   Just that I have to be persistent and correct myself until I get it right if i want it to look realistic.Hopefully I'll be faster in the future."

learnart,3e68kf,PROUD_HUFFLEPUFF,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:51:54 2015 UTC,"Also, I would suggest spending money on some good art education. Preferably take some classes at a community college or some sort of events/training courses. Don't waste your money on art school unless you do your research because a lot of them are either scams or don't provide all of what they claim. Believe me, I went to an art school and all i got out of it was debt.  So. practice practice practice. Also, i highly suggest the book ""Drawing on the right side of the brain"", though it's clear you know how to draw, it's just a great book to have in your library to come back to."
learnart,3e68kf,Zenhabbit,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:26:18 2015 UTC,"the best thing you can do to improve is just draw from life, I walk around all day with sketchbooks and some favorite pens and i try to draw whatever I find interesting. I usually draw people, but buildings, lamps,trees etc etc. Also color is best achieved by viewing also life, if you want to learn about color and lighting you can paint outside. If you kept this up  your art will show so much more improvement and in the long run you will be better for it. Professionals will fill an entire sketchbook in one to to two months."
learnart,3e60gj,Portalboat,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:44:32 2015 UTC,you gotta do both  if you only draw from reference you become a slave to reference and will find it frustrating if you cant find perfect reference  if you never draw from reference (or study from life for that matter) your art will look like shit.  unless the point of your art is to not have any semblance of realism whatsoever.
learnart,3e60gj,tentativesteps,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:11:41 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people do the whole ""copying from a reference"" thing wrong when they first do it. I did for sure until it clicked for me. It's easy to just copy each line you see on the reference and hence creating a nice looking copy. But that doesn't help you much.  What you ought to do though is to understand the forms of your subject matter. What are the forms (e.g. simplified three-dimensional objects) that make up your subject? How do they connect and interact? What are their restraints when forming the subject? You have to understand and memorize so you can ultimately use what you have learned in your own drawings and no longer need to rely on a reference completely.  I'm still pretty new to drawing myself, but understanding how to properly copy from a reference has helped me immensely."

learnart,3e5bwr,rogueSnailio,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:01:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here ask the same thing, r/artfundamentals is a good place to start.    Also, I know you want to draw manga, but if you're just beginning I think you should learn how to draw from the real world first (eg. People, Still objects etc.)  In my opinion it makes it a lot easier to learn different styles, and if you ever get tired of manga you'll be able to find your own style maybe.  A lot of background art for manga is really technical, so you'll probably have to find some videos or tutorials teaching perspective drawing.    Another thing, get a small sketchbook, I just got like a $7 A5 sketchbook to do random doodles in whenever you want.  Just fill up each page everynow and then with things that come to mind or things you see around you.    Good luck!"
learnart,3e3vqc,PessimisticOptimist1,4,Tue Jul 21 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"What I found helped me most when it comes to drawing the world that surrounds our characters was to go back to the basics and learn how to create the illusion of form. I probably grew the most when I studied Dynamic Sketching at Concept Design Academy. You might want to check out the online version of the course. I also post a poor man's version of the material, covering the lessons as I understood them, over at /r/ArtFundamentals. It's not perfect, but it is free."

learnart,3e4en3,follymiser,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:54 2015 UTC,"Looks cool!  To me it's less that the proportions are off and more that the orientation of the torso is off.  The neck/head and legs are more or less aligned, but the torso is turned a bit too much toward the viewer.  You could probably fix this by bringing the entire right (from my view) side of the torso in about a fifth of the way and redrawing the breasts (they're facing a bit too much toward the viewer in my opinion)."
learnart,3e3uzm,hpizzle12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:07 2015 UTC,"Just looking at their drawings and incorporating what I've learned through fundamentals + imitating?   This is pretty much what I was going to say, actually. Stuff like the images on the first link you posted can be easily created with a program like Illustrator or Photoshop. All you need are good drawing skills, and an understanding of color and how it's affected by form and light. You'll have to learn the tools of those programs, though. Which can be daunting depending on how complex you want to get."
learnart,3e3uzm,Aaroniero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"Imitation is one of the best techniques when learning how to do art. Find the style you like and start drawing as many different things with that style as you can. When you think you have enough, eye-ball it and see what you like and see what you can personally change and/or add to it.   comics that I could acquire more tutorials   Tutorials can also be a huge help and can work the same way through imitation. Find one you like and change some things to make it work for yourself. :)"

learnart,3dzrq4,sleeper90,7,Tue Jul 21 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"What's great about this sketch is that it's not a photorealistic copy of your picture.  A portrait shouldn't just be a picture of the subject, it should also be a study of the artist.    It's clear here that you drew what you saw -- which is to say, what you focused on in the picture.  The only thing keeping this from being a finished picture is that it's a floating head -- there's no sense of where it is in space.  Even some light shading in the background would give it depth.  Plus you could shade in some indication of shoulders so that it's sitting on something."
learnart,3dzrq4,DingDongSeven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:30:45 2015 UTC,I was thinking that too. I think I'll add shoulders. Thank you for the encouragement
learnart,3dzrq4,mastermindwoof,5,Tue Jul 21 01:29:09 2015 UTC,"Hey, my advice is to not only try to draw ""realistically"" by copying photos, but focus on the whole page and composition. Use representation as a medium or motif, not as the main goal. This might seem like random advice but as someone who also loves to draw faces, I often don't know where to go from there to make a finished product, and I noticed this sub seems kind of focused on drawing representationally, but not engaging with the entire composition.  I think if you started this same drawing with quickly playing with the placement of the head, shoulders, and rhythm of the rectangles on his shirt and on the wall, it would look like a study for a finished work as well as being practice in getting the hang of a portrait. In addition, it would help you understand how his face fits in space and help you notice if a proportion on his face is 'off' compared to the whole scene. One thing I like to do is draw from photographs I have carefully staged and cropped, since I do still like to draw from photos.  Ok that turned into a rant, but basically you really did a good job in capturing his face and I love the texture of the beard and would love to see more of what you do."

learnart,3e26i4,Jamaz,3,Tue Jul 21 11:28:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it is the standard, but people are of course free to use multiple programs if it fits their workflow. If your lines come out pixelated then you are probably working at a too low resolution though.  As for line quality, it is definitely a good idea to work on this by yourself and try to get as good as you can. It'll save you a lot of time redrawing lines in the long run.   There is however a program called Lazy Nezumi that does line smoothing and works across programs including Photoshop. It is unfortunately Windows only though."
learnart,3e26i4,Toldea,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:06 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily standard, but you're free to use multiple programs. You absolutely should work on making your lines straighter yourself. Outside of that, I think photoshop is widely considered a better program, and it'd benefit you to learn how to use the pen tool in conjunction with the brush tool to make your outlines straighter."
learnart,3e26i4,nickgreen90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:34 2015 UTC,"I actually do use the pen tool a great deal, but it seems like cheating? I make these very crisp looking lines, but there's not really an organic feel to them. Do expert artists normally use the pen as part of their widely used tools, or do they normally not even bother with it?"
learnart,3e26i4,nickgreen90,2,Wed Jul 22 00:15:39 2015 UTC,"There's really no such thing as cheating in art unless you directly steal someone else's work. Like all things, the pen tool takes practice. Your lines will look artificial at first; you have to get the have of curving them just so. Yes, many artists do use the pen tool. It is very widely regarded as one of the most important features of photoshop."

learnart,3dzden,MineDogger,3,Mon Jul 20 20:16:01 2015 UTC,"I guess once you adopt cooler tones, the thing is to place/mix them correctly. I think the big hurdle for artists portraying flesh is that we tend to simplify images, and for most design applications this is good for consistency, clarity, symmetry etc. but then we forget that skin is translucent, its less noticeable in darker skin, but there is a radiance to the skin, it absorbs and reflects light but some actually penetrates the surface. This muddies/soften the tones seen because you're looking at a mixture of light that was reflected from the surface and light that got through, and was partially reflected back, so under certain lighting it has a fuzzy or glowing quality. Give the skin a bit more texture, (it seems too flat or slick, also capillary density makes areas of the face darker) and try to express some of that luminosity and depth."
learnart,3dzden,Pax9z,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice love!   That actually made more sense than all the YouTube videos I have been pouring over. lol
learnart,3dzden,hchano,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:52 2015 UTC,Color and Light by Gurney would be worth a visit. Look at how other masters or modern artists you look up to tackle the situation. Master studies are invaluable in this situation.
learnart,3dxepd,Harlequnne,6,Mon Jul 20 09:26:15 2015 UTC,"Are you still drawing on your phone, goddammit? :) You seem to be really finessing out the stroke technique. I was actually going to say you might be over-relying on the program to taper the lines, but I zoomed in really close and it looks like you actually did them all manually? Gettin it.  It looks nice, and you clearly have a style you want to incorporate. Where can you improve? I think you may be symbol drawing. I've only seen this and the profile shot on the other one. I don't know if your phone would allow you to work in layers, in which case, you should draw some underlying constuction. Without it, all the features have the look of symbols arranged in open space. Try some more varied angles.  Enjoyed the line weight variation on the body. On the hair it kinda read weird, it looks like it was hard to define that edge in places, where in others it kinda bled into space. Anyway, big improvement on technique!"
learnart,3dxepd,OftenPyr,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:04 2015 UTC,"LOL, yes!  I am.  I'm in the market for a tablet, though!  You called it on the lines, too, I can't get the pen to taper the way I want so I just shrink that sucker down and do it myself.  I do try to do some foundation work when I'm working with more body, but for the face, I have trouble translating the underlying shapes into something that looks correct on paper.  Shading is the bane of my existence, and something I've gone back to and back to to try and incorporate but I always struggle with it, so I end up not doing it.  I'd love some suggestions on good resources for it!"
learnart,3dxepd,toxicpretty,3,Mon Jul 20 17:15:48 2015 UTC,"For shading and underlying construction, break the face down into basic shapes...the head is an egg like shape, the nose is a bit of a squared off pyramid, eyes are deepset eggs....then practice shading those basic forms keeping a single light source at first. Google basic face shading for more exact forms.   Then when you master that, you can go back to line work but you'll be clearer on the forms your lining and how they relate. Thicks and thins in line work are often used to denote form. Thins can show light and where forms intersect and thicks suggest shadow and density."
learnart,3dxepd,karmaisanal,3,Mon Jul 20 17:47:57 2015 UTC,On a phone lol - it's a masterpiece for phone work.   If you want to improve you can think about the dimensionality that you want to achieve - the tattoo is a bit flattening - kind of a lack of contour indication in that area.   I love the hair.   Try and get every piece of the canvas to add to the mood / image - eg it might be enhanced with a background.  Don't be offended it is good work. And honestly even if you show me early Rembrants I can still bang on finding room for improvements from my perspective. I am just like that!

learnart,3dxepd,analogphototaker,2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:31 2015 UTC,"Have a look at what other portrait artists do with backgrounds. If you are painting a character it can be very powerful to have them set amongst their own furnishings. Their own personality then comes out both from the style of the room and from the person, it adds to the story, it enriches the story. Perversely you can use contrasting elements to create good images too, it creates a different effect; paradox and tension."
learnart,3dxepd,analogphototaker,3,Mon Jul 20 21:19:09 2015 UTC,I don't understand how you did this on a phone. Can you record a video of you doing something similar so we can see apps you are using/how you do it?

The line work from those are immpecible, and are worth the master study in order to get a better feel for line work. Lines are smooth and confident. Definitely learn the anatomy of the neck, as a major muscle should be poking out given her stretching of the neck. Unless you chose to leave that out to draw more attention to the focal point. In gestural work like this, try using C S and I curves primarily. They are easier to read and will make your piece easier to read as a result. This is technically hard, but try to wrap the pattern around the arm. The arm is a cylinder, so imagine taking the pattern and pasting it on the cylinder. Loomis discusses this in Successful Drawing."

What has helped me get through it the fastest is reminding myself that just doing something, anything, even a bad thing, will have brought me closer to my goal than say browsing reddit or something. What is equally as important to remember is that when you're faced with a block like this, all that perfect stroke stuff goes out the window; once you've built up some momentum you can start to worry about that stuff. It's not as hard to knock a top down when it's spinning fast, it may wobble but it will self-correct. Think of yourself that way, and by getting drawing  good or bad, you will start spinning.

Digital adds an extra layer of disconnection between you and the 'paper'. Further more it is easier to develop bad habits if you learn your fundamentals digitally because of the many clutches at your disposal.  Once you have a basic traditional foundation you'll be able to better decide if art is an interest you'd like to continue pursuing and if a tablet is worth the investment.   As for which one to get, Wacom is the commonly used brand. You can either get one of the cheaper models, perhaps second hand, and optionally upgrade later or jump straight into the Intuos Pro line. I wouldn't go for a Cintiq unless money isn't an issue or you are already making a living off of your art. The Intuos Pro is more than capable of producing professional work. Finally there are some lesser known and often cheaper brands, though I don't have any personal experience with them so I can't really comment on those."

It'll last long enough but you don't want the most hardy or expensive tablet to start with. Source: Im a long time tablet and tablet display user.  Don't bother with any other brand and don't even look at Wacoms more expensive product lines right now.  Lol I'm not being paid by them but I and many others have tried all sorts of tablet brands and in the end there's a reason Wacom corners the market.

During your application stage, whatever you struggle with or fail to do correctly is what warrants more study. Do not get discouraged, even if all of it on your first trial from memory is wrong. Just keep chipping at it. It gets better. Just rinse and repeat the method above. Never stop learning. Start with Drawing the Head and Hands, reading through sections and doing the sequence above with the plates. I'd recommend quickposes, pixelovely, and Croquis Cafe (youtube) for poses. If you're struggling with a subject within the books after multiple attempts, look to other sources for assistance. Loomis explains a lot correct but some of it is very hard to understand.   Regarding Figure Drawing For All It's Worth, just struggle through it. Personally, what I did is I did the figure drawing course offered by Proko (the free version) and the anatomy of the torso from Proko, then tackled Figure Drawing For All It's Worth.   Even though it sucks a lot, drawing from memory is the true test of your ability and it is what gives you the power to draw whatever you want given you have the knowledge and practice to draw it. ALWAYS fill in gaps of your knowledge that you notice in your ""tests"", otherwise it'll bite you in the ass later.   Good luck!"

So exposed turp evaporates while its sitting there and gets into the air around you.....so limit the amount that is exposed at a time.....keep lids closed when not using, use small amounts or only what you need on the palette or canvas. A great trick is to decanter some into a small squirt bottle that u can you a little at a time and stays sealed. The next biggie is ventilation .....circulating the air out and having cleAn air coming in. Fans , windows, these all help.

learnart,3dxtas,thevaliantx,0,Mon Jul 20 12:31:15 2015 UTC,"Like anything, oil paint has a shelf life and personally, I would never create a painting I planned on selling using a mix of old & new paint. Perhaps maybe if I was a beginner and just using them for practice pieces, but never on something I was going to sell with an expectation to be archival.   There's so many variables to your question it's almost impossible to answer in an online format:   What brand do you like? Each brand uses individual recipes for color and binder, not to mention grade of paint (e.g. student or professional)   What style do you paint? Impasto, impressionist or hyper realism?  What surface are you painting on? Smooth panel, gessoed canvas (portrait grade, student grade, museum grade, etc., etc.)   I use professional grade Winsor & Newton. They are packaged with different ""binders"". Some use linseed oil, safflower oil or a mix of the two. Some are packaged with more binder in the tube depending on the nature of the color. Earth based colors (yellow ochre, siennas and umbers) come out of the tube dry while cad red medium comes out soupy oozing binder. So, I use more medium when I paint with earth tones and less when I use man-made colors.   Bottom line, it's part of the learning curve when you paint. For instance, I've been painting for ten years and still just recently adjusted which colors are on my palette and what medium I use to get the results I want. Study the manufacturer's information on their website, read what other artists use and observe what results they get and go for it."

It depends on what you want to improve: color, shading, composition, brush techniques, figures, faces, still life, landscape, etc. Personally, I think that painting from photos is pretty good practice for almost everything except composition.

You're flexing your hand and eye coordination muscles, there's no age limit :)   I'll just give you my opinion about getting better at drawing: I am currently vistinging art school. The main 'advice' we get here is ""sketch, sketch, for god's sake SKETCH"". We're sketching on busses, trains,in the mountains, while hiking, while eating, while partying, while vistinging museums, while sleeping D:  Joking aside, it doesn't matter which course you're taking, you'll aways end up doing skechtes. A lot of sketches. If you can, document what you're eating, where you're going, what you're doing. Keep a sketch diary. Use those sketches for your work. Sketch everywhere and if you want to create a picture with a certain technique, google it, search for a local one time course and/gor get a book about it. There are some really good ones around. (just an all time favourite example: http://www.amazon.de/Color-Light-Guide-Realist-Painter/dp/0740797719) After you got the basics, use them as much as possible and try to 'do it wrong' in order to find ways beyond the basics.   And most importantly: Think about your sketches and artwork. What did you figure out, while sketching? Did you notice something that you never noticed before? (maybe a way how the nose is formed, or how a tree branches, etc). Drawing is, besides training your hand-eye coordination also a great deal about understanding, what you're seeing, and that requires to think and talk with someone about it :)"

learnart,3dpdff,LeEpicTrollchan,3,Sat Jul 18 04:07:48 2015 UTC,"This was a cool read with like useful links. I say use whatever. personally I feel that drawing from life is overrated. for instance let's say your drawing the figure. ok cool. your drawing from life with some random model with their giggling bits out, however you don't draw what you see. you design what you know. form is based on geometric shapes . if you can't see these geometric mass groups and make design decisions about how to convey them then you might struggle to classically depict the figure with any representatial accuracy. this goes for drawing from life and a picture . a figure drawing is a conceptual construct and those structural elements aren't just gonna speak to you without having knowledge of them .   If you move into photorealism like the works of charles bell or early chuck close. It's no longer about geometry or learning about form . It's about mapping tonality and depicting faithfully every value in whatever medium your using [period] It's just a specialized form of painting that's rather painstakingly technical that leads to what Ralph Goings, another early photorealist, calls the Gee Wiz factor.  That's where you say oh shit that's a painting!? Photorealism doesn't per se teach you how to draw rather its about techniques about how to get close to perfect placement, tones, tints, and shades. At least that was my experience when I practiced that method of painting.   Personally I feel that a cool way to learn to draw figures is with geometric shapes, perspective, anatomy , and proportion . If you have that knowledge base and skills you can draw figures without sources like a model or a picture. And when you do have a souce you can better utilize it cause you got a solid foundation. peace"
learnart,3dpdff,32mm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:05:45 2015 UTC,Each have their own benefits as you pointed out. I think the main point behind drawing from life is that you are forced to maintain perspective relative to the subject. If you move everything changes leading to frustration from the person drawing. This is not an issue when drawing from a photo. Drawing from photo as it allows you to study aspects lost by time such as a jump or a dive. This is especially helpful for people who don't have the image catalog to draw from imagination. I do not understand why this is still an issue to this day. It's like arguing that producers aren't musicians because they don't play a guitar.
learnart,3dpdff,tranzalorebreech,0,Tue Jul 21 15:27:04 2015 UTC,"OP's question placed 'drawing from life' and 'drawing from photographs' in contest, adding that 'drawing from life' is said to be more beneficial. On a subreddit about learning art, asking why one is better than the other is not a very good question and miss represents their respected uses.   In all honesty, I think you're being unfair to /u/headphone3157.  (S)he was asking for clarification of statements (s)he had observed, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  Such interest in learning the reasoning behind commonly held assertions should be encouraged on a sub dedicated to learning.   Is it really that uncommon to see a teacher drawing over a photo to explain something about seeing rhythm or simple forms?   I can only say that I have never experienced it, no professional I've ever encountered in university, college prep courses or private courses outside of school has taught that way.  I'm having a difficult time even remembering anyone drawing over an image, photograph or otherwise.  If they wanted to show a concept they mostly drew out a diagram themselves or used a pointer while referencing a large print, slide or monitor.  Now that may just be my experience but I've never come across anyone who learned the basics differently from a professionally guided course.   Is it really unheard of to hear about an illustrator or a comic artist who in their youth copied out of sports magazines?   Absolutely not, in fact there are some very controversial comic illustrators who still do it (and in the case of Greg Land trace from porn).  That practice, while fast, comes at a cost.  Often those who trace run into problems with repetitive poses and lack of cohesive character designs due to cobbling together poses from different sources.  Plenty of people draw from whatever media is at hand when they are young, I myself copied book covers in middle school.  But when we are talking about guided training what we did before becomes a moot point.  Otherwise the first step in any drawing lesson should arguably be finger painting with strained peas.   One popular use of teaching with photos is using them to study figure drawing. In lesson 4 Drawing the Human Form from The Famous Artist School's Correspondence Course photographs [3] are given as an assignment. And in lesson 5 it's suggested [4] to use photos of people to study for artistic anatomy. Artist Sarah Simblet published a popular anatomy book[5] that uses photos to demonstrate her points. Micheal Hampton in his Analytical Anatomy for CG Master's Academy course used[6] photos to demonstrate his ideas about drawing the human form. Croquis Cafe has several posing videos[7] , offering that as a supplement for artist who can't get access to a live model.   Ah, not here's an interesting point.  Your examples are all coming from courses that by their nature cannot use live drawing, so of course photos are the best option available.  And none appear to be advocating against life drawing if it's possible for the student.  No one here is saying ""live drawing or nothing"" just that given the option between the two there are some advantages to life drawing that photographs lack.  And if you are in the process of learning those advantages can be valuable.     Photos can be used as a learning tool early on much in the same way cast drawings were used in Bargue's drawing course[11] or like how illustrations are used in how-to-draw books.   I don't disagree with you there however I feel there's a danger in using any source exclusively without understanding the limitations.  Right now it is extremely common for new artists to learn exclusively from photographs and videos due to sheer availability, that's why so much of the pushback from the more experienced set is towards life drawing.  It's important for someone new to learning to have the opportunity to do so from multiple sources and have the ability to make informed decisions about their progress."

My major point is that one is not better than the other because their respected uses gauge different learning aspects about drawing. I also said that they benefit each other because of that relation. Life drawing will not teach the theories that can be learned from images, it will however teach the application of those theories. And visa versa with images (photos)."

learnart,3dp5od,DantetheLion,2,Sat Jul 18 02:51:20 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand your first question. Like... when you sign up for Adobe CC and install it on your computer, the software is on you computer. You're not using it through the web. If you're looking for a way to pirate or crack the subscription requirement, personally I pay for my subscription so I wouldn't know.  I think the subscription allows you to use the software on 2 computers concurrently.   The Adobe CC site is not particularly clear about some of its policies, but this site breaks down the common questions/concerns pretty well.   I think Photoshop for digital drawing/painting is more powerful and versatile. There is a lot of art software (Manga Studio, Corel Paint, etc) that are very good for what they are, but have limitations. In PS CC you can do a lot of editing as well as animation in addition to drawing/painting. The default photoshop brushes are ok, but with a pressure sensitive tablet and a more advanced brush pack (Kyle Webster's brush packs are inexpensive and are quickly becoming the name in photoshop brushes) you can do everything from replicating traditional medium to uniquely digital compositions."
learnart,3dp5od,cajolerisms,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:08:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer.  I forgot to mention that I tried PS CC15 on an old laptop, so I was worried that this $10/mo deal was ""tied"" to this computer only.  Is Kyle's $14 Megapack quite better than all the free popular Ps brushes in DeviantArt?"
learnart,3dp5od,cajolerisms,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:23:04 2015 UTC,"You would be able to use Ps CC on another computer. if you go over the 2 limit, you can deactivate it on one of the previous computers.   Kyle Webster's packs mimic traditional mediums and have a lot of amazing built-in variation as if you're using a physical brush or pen. If you're doing a very clean digital thing, you wouldn't need them, though his pen tools for inking/outlining are also very good without needing to mess around with the settings. He also provides free updates a few times a year, so the number of brushes in the pack will increase without any additional cost.  For $14 it's a lot of high quality tools that in my experience has been worth the money and has made painting in Photoshop a much better experience. I like them so much, I bought his other packs."

You could use tape, but test it first as some let a little paint bleed under the edge, or you could draw onto the prepped background with pencil and fill it in with a brush. I get the best control for edges with round and chisel brushes."
learnart,3dm79t,headphone3157,12,Fri Jul 17 12:04:04 2015 UTC,"Mostly the fact that you don't get real depth information from a photograph. Your two eyes looking at a real object have a much better chance at accurately understanding an objects shape and how the various objects relate. Also, photography by nature, changes the perception of depth depending on the type of lens used.   The best example I can think of at the moment is a person on a pose where their limbs are at different depths. While your mind tries to fill in the gaps from experience, In a photograph, then shapes comprising the figure will just look different sizes."
learnart,3dm79t,PencilPushing,6,Fri Jul 17 12:30:13 2015 UTC,"Both /u/PencilPushing and /u/Uncomfortable are right but I'll add another point.  A photograph is already a stylized version of life.  A photographer has already chosen how to frame the model, what lighting to use and what scenery and pose to use.  That means you never get the ability to make those decisions yourself.  If you're in a life drawing course for instance you will get the opportunity to choose which angle to draw the model from and how you want to frame the piece.  If it's not a class you get even more control over the composition, allowing you to learn more aspects of art than how to recreate details."
learnart,3dm79t,EctMills,4,Fri Jul 17 13:16:23 2015 UTC,"Beyond the issue of depth information that /u/PencilPushing mentioned, I've seen that many people who draw from photographs find it very easy to get into the bad habit of simply drawing what they see in the photo - flat, 2D shapes, in a flat, 2D world. Everything around us is composed of 3D constructions - basic forms that connect with one another and move through 3D space.  If you're dealing with a photograph, it can be much easier to just shut your brain off and behave like a glorified photocopier, carrying over detail after detail as it exists in the 2D plane. Doing so doesn't teach you how to reconstruct those forms and objects on your own, however.  Drawing from life is definitely ideal, because it doesn't do any of the work for you - before being able to put anything down on paper, you have to interpret it for yourself, taking what is presented to you as 3D information (with all of the depth and complexity) and simplifying it down into something that can be transferred to a 2D plane.  That said, I do feel that you can gain a little more from photographs by forcing yourself to interpret it as a scene in a 3D world. It isn't perfect, it doesn't give you the full benefits, and it certainly isn't easy (especially for a beginner) but by seeing objects as forms that exist through several layers of space, you will gain more than simply carrying over flattened information.  I will however say that doing so becomes significantly easier once you've actually had some life drawing under your belt, as you have a better sense of how to interpret those photographs."
learnart,3dm79t,Uncomfortable,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:01:37 2015 UTC,"Drawing from life doesn't have benefits over drawing from photographs. They have their differences, yes, mainly the translating of information, but one isn't superior over the other when it comes to teaching you how to draw. If anything drawing from life is usually better done after you developed a proficiency with drawing from static flat images.  In fact, it's been a long tradition at art schools to begin learning to draw from flat 2d pictures and gradually work your way to drawing from direct observation of nature. The idea is to build up an understanding of the theories about how to see things and turn that into a drawing. You start simple and continue on to more complicated things. From 2D to 3D.   What happens is that as more dimensionality is added you're tasked with using what you know so far to help manage that additional stuff into your drawing. Drawing from life in a sense becomes the ultimate test of your observation skills.   And once you develop keen artistic sight you'll begin to see that there is more to nature than its 3d qualities. Starting simple and working your way up learning more complicated stuff will help manage the new challenges you'll see. Life drawing isn't more beneficial if you never learned to draw from simpler observations, it's just more complicated.   So, learning from simpler experiences will benefit you more so when tackling more complicated experiences like drawing from life."
learnart,3dm79t,LeEpicTrollchan,2,Fri Jul 17 14:21:42 2015 UTC,"I've never come across a program that uses picture references before the most basic still life exercises.  Sure you do pattern and design exercises to learn mark making and use the basic ""here's how light hits a cube, cylinder and pyramid"" diagrams first but that doesn't use photographs as a source, at least not in any of the classes I ever took.  Where have you found a program that starts with photographs?"
learnart,3dm79t,EctMills,2,Fri Jul 17 15:43:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of traditional training was done like that from other drawings instead of photo's.  Very commen to start by copying ""plates"" them moving to casts, and finally life."

I have been through a ton of art instruction, and I was never asked to reference from a photo.  In fact, it was actively discouraged by every instructor I have had.  The only 2D reference I have been asked to use has been for master studies from actual artwork hanging in a museum.  And we were explicitly told to make our drawings there in the museum, and not from a photo of the artwork, even if we took the photo ourselves."

The drawings being used would have been made by a two eyed person instead of a one eyed camera (barring cycloptic master artists, which would be fascinating if they happened) and not suffer from the issues of depth that are unique to photographs.  Also it's worthwhile to note that it's a system that hasn't survived too well into the modern era.  It's generally more, markmaking practice > basic concepts of perspective, shading and composition > still life > live models."

I don't know if it was his meaning but since he mentioned tradition I was assuming that he was using the practice of drawing plates as his/her basis.  I'm not arguing the merit of using flats first, but simply that it was historically done in some schools.  I agree that it might not be the same with photo's vs etchings.  I'm not convinced that it not surviving into modern practice is a strong argument for not doing it.  When browsing art I'm often struck by the thought that we must be missing something now days.  :D   (said in a light manner, not a serious argument.  :))"

Well Ectmills did say ""picture references"" and not photo ref.   To be fair I did say that and while I meant photographic references like the OP was asking about I won't edit it now since it's part of the conversation.  I suspect you're right and /u/LeEpicTrollchan was either thinking of drawing plates or combining them with master studies.   I'm not convinced that it not surviving into modern practice is a strong argument for not doing it.   I'm not really arguing for or against doing things that way, but the original comment seemed to be indicating that it's still standard practice which is why I mentioned it.     When browsing art I'm often struck by the thought that we must be missing something now days.   That's an interesting observation and I wonder how much of it is the result of increased access to art in general and how much is related to actual changes in practice.  If you think about it, we only really ever see a few examples of each era of artwork, no where near the actual volume of work produced at the time.  There must be huge amounts of sub par work that were lost, destroyed or simply never made it into a text book or museum.  But now everything is saved and easily accessed on portfolio sites, reddit threads, libraries or just plastered in our everyday life on billboards and packaging.  We get hit by so much more visual media now that it's harder to notice the good stuff than when we're looking at the few Renaissance paintings that survived into our cultural awareness.  It's similar to impressions of old cinema.  We never really think about the flops or lame cash in movies from the 40's, they absolutely were there but most just didn't survive beyond a passing mention.  But you can't turn on the TV without seeing three ads for Transformers VI, another cop drama TV show and six kids movies that no one put any effort into."

I wonder about that all the time, and what the ratio was from good to bad.  You can kind of get an idea of some of the mass variation in quality from some era's at http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/ where there are photo's of a lot of museum collections that didn't make the display cut but are still kept in the collection.  I admit my bias and ignorance is showing for sure with the privious comment.

This is the best way to get natural looking poses because it is just that, natural.  -keep an eye out for good references, both photos and drawings.

I noticed my drawings of people got much better when I was able to see a model in front of me. Photos of 2-d flat images and they dont hold all the truth for what you are viewing, meaning we are all 3 dimensional and lines disappear and thin out as the face or body curves away from us. So take lots of life drawing classes and free model sessions that people start up in your neighborhood. Heck if not ask your family to pose for you for like 20 minutes or so. Next study human anatomy and make sure you learn all the important reasons why faces look the way they do, and the body's significant bumps that stick out and slim down.

If you are bad at drawing hands then spend an hour each day drawing hands. If you feel you could improve in composition/value/color then maybe do a master study each day. Do perspective exercises if they give you trouble. Etc.   Find something you are weak at and want to improve at and try to incorporate it into your schedule.

Amazon is decent for supplies but could feel generic depending on her preferences (I personally would be very happy with it, but your mileage may very). Dick Blick and Utrecht are big proper art supply stores with online stores and locations in most US cities.   Or pretend you're asking on behalf of a relative or friend who wants to take up art and have her give a rundown of her favorite art supplies. Brushes have the brand, model number, and size number printed on the handle. Paints are pretty clearly labeled.

There's a motto for runners: ""No matter how slowly you run, you're doing laps around the people on sitting on a couch"". It applies to artists as well, as long as you're doing something and having fun with it, who cares if it turns out perfect?  Dare to make mistakes, in fact, make it a daily goal. When you make it, instead of thinking ""How do I fix this?"", think ""How can I work with this?"". Throw yourself out there and try new things.

That way forces you to pre-visualise your marks and make bold confident lines or otherwise live with the results.  Finally don't worry too much about the paper. Sketchbooks or copy paper is cheap enough to be worth the investment. Otherwise don't get too attached to your results. Try to think of your work as mere byproduct on your way to improve. You probably won't even look at your sketch a week later but you'll carry the increase in skill with you for the rest of your life. Good luck!"
learnart,3dj7eg,Toldea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:29:28 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't the wasted paper, but the wasted time in ruining a two minute sketch in two seconds.  Practicing by inking my old sketches sounds like an excellent idea, though!"
learnart,3dj7eg,cajolerisms,3,Thu Jul 16 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"You're going to have to transition your thinking in terms of time scale. I realize you're exaggerating a bit, but a nicely drawn piece worth inking takes more than a few minutes, and inking can be a slow and thoughtful process that shouldn't be rushed. If you're always worried about taking too much time, you'll be thinking about that rather than focusing on doing whatever it takes to make the right marks. It doesn't matter how long it takes to make a successful drawing."
learnart,3dj7eg,jarwastudios,2,Thu Jul 16 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"If you have access to a copier, make copies of your pencil drawings and ink those as practice, then you don't ruin anything.  Also what I used to do was make copies then try out different ways of inking so I could practice shading with inking, line variance, overstyling/understyling, etc. I used to look at a lot of different comic artists as reference and I tried my best to emulate them to learn different artistic qualities."
learnart,3dj7eg,jawda1210,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:05:59 2015 UTC,thats actually a really good idea. I don't know why ive never thought to make copies. I may have to try this to practice shading and using color especially. Thanks :)
learnart,3dj7eg,EctMills,2,Fri Jul 17 14:16:42 2015 UTC,Do you have any examples of the types of drawings you're trying to ink and the style you would like to end up with?  What kinds of pens and ink are you using?  Can you show a piece that didn't go well so we can see where you may be going wrong?
learnart,3dj7eg,EctMills,2,Thu Jul 16 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"I use fine tip technical and ballpoint pens.  I don't have my scanner right now so I can't show any specific examples of anything, but a lot of my lines are choppy, wobbly, and don't connect well."
learnart,3dj7eg,LegendaryVegan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:27:14 2015 UTC,"A lot of the choppy and wobbly lines are only going to get better in time but for training yourself make sure your movements are coming from your shoulder and elbow as much as possible instead of your wrist.  It's hard with ink because you're making much smaller marks than with charcoal or a paintbrush but that mixed with practice will help.    For long straight lines there's no shame in using a straight edge, I do it all the time.  Just make sure you use a ruler with a raised lip so you don't smudge the ink.  I'd also reccomend doing exercises specifically designed to force you to make a lot of different marks.  Something like this or this for pattern and texture and this for getting your lines to connect.  A lot of my early inking was focused on Celtic knotwork which taught me control, pattern and continuing lines that had been broken, if you pick up a cheap book of knotwork patterns that could give you a lot of fodder for practicing.  Best of luck!"
learnart,3dj7eg,tehwabi,2,Thu Jul 16 19:45:03 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to ruin a sketch. It takes a lot of practice. You can use a lightbox or prints of your sketches to establish a safety net, but be wary of falling into the trap of re-doing the same piece again and again and not moving forward with a new piece, which is much more educational."
learnart,3dj7eg,searine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"I'm still not very good at inking. But a few months ago I started doing my practice drawing with a ballpoint pen on cheap printer paper. I'm a lot more confident with the lines I put down and it forced me to really think about what I draw before I draw it. The printer paper is good for practice because it's so cheap and if it's just practice, I have no reason to care if it's good or not.  I'm looking forward to what others have to say though, because I'm still not that great at inking sketches when I'm doing more than practicing."
learnart,3dj7eg,searine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:04:27 2015 UTC,What types of exercises do you use to boost your confidence with lines?
learnart,3dj7eg,tehwabi,3,Thu Jul 16 19:27:55 2015 UTC,"My go to line practices are :  Connecting two dots from across the page with a straight line, in one smooth motion.  Drawing a complex squiggly curved shape, and then going back over the shape as accurately/quickly as I can, while keeping a consistent line weight.  Drawing freehand circles quickly, of various size, in one smooth motion, while trying to keep them as round as possible.

learnart,3dj7eg,cajolerisms,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:18:37 2015 UTC,"with the ""perfect circle"" exercise I don't go back over the circle. I just try to connect the start to the finish in one smooth quick motion, making a perfect (usually imperfect) circle in the process.   Often, when I do the squiggly line practice, after I'm done, I'll fill the squiggly line with these kind of quick circles."
learnart,3dj7eg,ZombieButch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:30:33 2015 UTC,"Nothing specific really. I've been practicing drawing hair and heads, so I'll fill up a page with heads drawn at different angles.

learnart,3dj7eg,CeadMileSlan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"I never ink on my original drawings because 1) I like the freedom to be messy in my original sketch and don't like bothering with fine erasing, 2) sometimes I draw on whatever is on hand including paper that isn't great with ink, and 3) sometimes shit happens. My pen will bleed or my cat will knock my elbow or whatever.   So I'll either scan in the pencil sketch and ink digitally (Kyle T Webster has excellent photoshop brushes that replicate a variety of inks and pens) or I'll use my super cheap DIY lightbox setup which is just a sheet of acrylic plexiglass from the hardware store, propped up on something the right height like an art supply case or some books, and a cheap attachable light with a switch from the hardware store that fits underneath.

learnart,3dilvh,Clawse,2,Thu Jul 16 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"Plagiarism, and it's big brother copyright infringement, is copying something and passing it off as your own to credit for personal gain. If you're just practicing and not trying to profit it off it, it doesn't matter in the least.   In art, the line between appropriation and plagiarism is very thin. There are a lot of commercial pieces that clearly copy old classic paintings, but either there's no legal protection against using that particular original image or it falls under an exception for artistic expression. The practice of master studies and copying existing art for educational purposes is centuries old and still an accepted learning method.   From your post history it looks like you're still learning and not at a point to be selling or making a name for yourself. I say don't worry about it and just draw whatever you want.   Don't trace though. Tracing doesn't teach you anything, and is therefore a different kind of cheating."
learnart,3dilvh,cajolerisms,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:03:23 2015 UTC,"For it to be plagiarism you have to be claiming the work as your own.  Make sure to reference the original work and it's not plagiarism.  The rub is that even if it isn't plagiarism it may still be copyright infringement.  That depends on whether the original image is under copyright or public domain, if any money was made from the new piece using a copyrighted work and if your work qualifies under one of the exceptions allowed in copyright law.  Most commonly people use transformative work to allow the use, for that you have to substantially change the original.  All of this is a very gray legal area and generally comes down to a decision made by a judge if a suit is filed.  If you're worried about this and using photos to learn to draw check out sites that specifically cater to public domain images, create your own references or go out and people watch.

learnart,3dhdwu,wordbits,3,Fri Jul 17 00:47:21 2015 UTC,I'm currently re-reading Perspective Made Easy by Ernest Norling. It doesn't deal with anatomy but is an excellent resource for learning about perspective.
learnart,3dhdwu,LegendaryVegan,2,Thu Jul 16 15:42:04 2015 UTC,The book Figure Drawing For All It's Worth by Andrew Loomis is essential.
learnart,3dhdwu,allboolshite,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:24:01 2015 UTC,"Just people or everything? If it's just people, I'd learn more about anatomy. If it's everything then you may want to develop a grid system or learn to use your thumb or pencil for measurements. Either way, try to draw from life more. And when it comes to perportions it's often easier to figure out where you went wrong after the fact by viewing your work in a mirror. Try to find patterns in your style or common mistakes that are throwing you off."
learnart,3dhdwu,TheAngelW,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:27:08 2015 UTC,"I m going to go against the crowd here and be a little provocative.   Do not ""learn about anatomy"", you don't need it. Does a artist need to know spider's anatomy to draw a spider? No of course, if he can observe he can draw. I'll go even futher and claim that a wrongly mastered knowledge of anatomy will leave you puzzled and mistaken. You'll try to follow bones and draw muscles and end up confused by the complexity of it.  What you need to to learn to look at the body, and forget it is body. It is lines, valors, arranged together and viewable in a certain way from you eye. What you see is what you need to draw, no more, no less.  Now, some actual technical advice:   direction of lines: does the shoulder line go down from the neck? how down?  verticals and horizontals: where does the vertical line coming up from the right side of the knee cross the arm? forget about oblics as they're treacherous when perspective is concerned. empty space: imagine a model standing, this hand resting on the hip, the arm extends away from the shoulder then goes back to the hip from the elbow. Sure you could look at this arm and draw it... but why not look at the triangle, the empty space, between the body, the forearm and the arm? see what it looks like, try to draw it instead of the arm. use the background: whatever lines or references passing behind the model can be used learn to measure holding your pen at arm's length draw from the inside of the body and not the outside. Example: start from the collar bone to find the nipple then the armpit then the arm, instead of drawing the shoulder top then the arm.   Bodies and figures are hard because we instinctly know what they're supposed to look like, it IS very difficult, don't give up :)Good luck!"
learnart,3dhdwu,Kardtart,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:07:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I figured that learning about bones and everything is kind of pointless considering that it's all just going to be covered up, really. What I meant was proportion, like the little skeleton thing that artists use as a reference for a certain pose.   Whenever I draw that and block it in it always just seems off. I was just hoping that there was some definite way / ""formula"" to drawing an accurate human body."
learnart,3dhvs9,Jamaz,5,Thu Jul 16 12:09:46 2015 UTC,"There are very few ""standards"" in digital painting and everyone finds their own way to achieve the visual results they want.  What's good for doing this or that depends a lot on the style. The majority of successful digital art comes from a strong foundation in traditional art and also digital experimentation.   One way to figure it out is to first do some little drawings with your brushes, playing around with the blending mode, pressure sensitivity, tilt, jitter, etc just you have kind of an idea of how it works. It shouldn't just be making random marks, but try some very simple little things like a sphere, cube, coffee mug, etc so there's a visual context for the marks. Play around with the supporting tools at different settings like dodge, burn, blur, and smudge. At this point you're just experimenting and mentally cataloguing the differences between settings. You might even want to go on the Photoshop site and read up on tools.   It's like you know what a pencil mark looks like vs a crayon or a marker. If you see someone's drawing, you can generally make a good guess on what they used because you have experience with those marks and tools yourself.   So once you've expanded your mental library of digital painting tools and have a better understanding of what each one looks like, pull up some examples of art you're trying to emulate, and do some studies-- that is, copy them and try to figure out their methods by playing detective using your knowledge of the paint tools."
learnart,3dhvs9,cajolerisms,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"when i think about using brushes other than the basic ones its usually for some sort of texture application. If im making a wooden shield for a character i might use a brush that has woodgrain, or if im making some clothes i might use the stitching brush to apply some nice evenly spaced stitches. if im doing a face, I'll find a nice skin pore brush. for landscapes ill find some grass and tree brushes. fur brushes have been a life saver for creating clothes and animals.  I use them less for ""painting"" and more for ""texturing"" my painings.  Just search for brushes on deviant art...youll find hundreds for each thing you look for.  doing cell shading is going to be more geared to using mask layering rather than finding useful brushes."

My advice is to change the background -- it can still be simple, but try to come up with something maybe more elegant, and use a lighter purple/pink to go more with her dress. Also her body looks a bit flat, I think you should shade it darker. Last piece of advice is to establish where the light source is, and make sure the shading is consistent."

learnart,3df8d4,swimmingretards,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:20:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe this series on the foundation of light and shadow might help you.  Otherwise, fully rendering out a figure is kind of like a big puzzle. You need a basic understanding of all the different pieces like anatomy, proportions, form, perspective and light to solve it. If you don't know the anatomy and the proportions you can't build your figure. If you can't think of the model as existing in 3d space then you can't light it.  To do a fully 'finished' drawing you need to be able to use and connect all those pieces. However that doesn't mean you should try to acquire those pieces all at the same time. Whenever you are overwhelmed with complexity, try to think of ways to simplify and to isolate your different problems.  Don't start with lighting a figure for example. Start with basic 3d forms like boxes and spheres. If you haven't studied perspective yet then learn to draw those forms correctly first. Stick to simple poses and camera angles if you are learning proportions so you don't need to spend as much time worrying about perspective and foreshortening. Focus on one thing at a time and get that down well before you add in more complexity.  Clothing folds are largely dependant on the figure that is underneath, so my recommendation would be to work on the figure first before moving into drapery. Once you are reasonably comfortable you can start to specifically study the behaviour of clothing. Draw from life and try to analyse why the different folds exist. Is gravity pulling down on it causing the cloth to bulge? Is a certain muscle stretched causing tension? Consider using a mirror to see how moving your body around changes the clothing folds."

learnart,3dejzr,Pytwd,4,Wed Jul 15 17:34:33 2015 UTC,"Sometimes making art is more of an endurance run than a fun ride. There are times where you have to go into your work like you're headed to… work. For me personally the finished product is the fun part, not the process. There's always a point in the work where it feels like it's taking forever, and this point I may give up if I don't make myself finish.   This is why schedules and deadlines are useful if not necessary. When you get up for a break, set a timer or watch the clock. Give yourself 10-15 minutes tops to go the bathroom or stretch your legs. When the time is up, get back to work whether you feel like it or not.   As far as concentration goes, part of becoming an artist is discovering the kind of artist you really are. It could be you're more into observational art and you get into it more because that's where your affinity lies. Making stuff up sounds cool and can be fun but not everyone's mind bends that way. This isn't a bad thing at all, as an artist you bring your observations to life, whether they are in the world or in your head. I'm not saying give up on making stuff up, if you enjoy that keep at it until it gets easier… only don't fight it if it's not coming to you or if it's not fun enough. Go where the water of your talent flows. Sometimes where we think we want to go isn't the best place for us to end up, and where we didn't expect to go is the best place for us to be.   Good luck."

I know new things are awesome, but your skills are not going to improve because you are using another way to make the drawing. While I've never used the products you've linked I don't think the price range you're in is going to give you something you're wanting to work with and that will hold up. Wacom Bamboos run about $80 I believe so if you go with anything, I would choose that.  But I would say just continue to draw, do classes if you can, do things online through other subs (/r/sketchdaily , /r/ronedrawingdaily , /r/artfundamentals , etc) and websites: http://www.permanoobs.org/index.php   There's a great amount of information out there for you to choose from. If you decide to go with the tablet go for it but you'll always be relying on your experiences and your practices."
learnart,3ddmah,personalcheesecake,5,Wed Jul 15 13:39:02 2015 UTC,"I know how you're feeling. When I started attending classes and educating myself in art I found my self in a situation where it seemed as though ""my eyes were learning faster than my hands"". I KNEW what I was drawing was SUPPOSED to look like but could never replicate it and that was the most frustrating thing in the world. The slew of amazing artists online and within the class didn't help either. But as many others are saying, you need to learn the fundamentals first. You sound just like me a while back, especially when it comes to tearing out pages and throwing out drawing. The truth is that you will need to go through HUNDREDS of shit drawing in order to level up to less-shit  drawings etc, until you can get to a satisfactory amount of not-shit-ness. I'm no where near there yet- but keeping shit drawings does wonders for the confidence, as it leaves a cement time line to look back upon how much you have improved.   On the topic of tablets from my personal experience. What initially made me want to enter the church of digital art was so I would be able to worship the almighty undo button deity. Once I had my drawing fundamentals down pat I moved into drawing with my smartphone's touch screen. I bought I simple app called ""sketch club pro"" and a decent phone stylus from best buy. Recent updates absolutely killed it's ""user friendliness"" and it's a pain to use now, but it's what worked for me when I started using it 5 years ago, so scour the App/play Store for what works for you. Drawing on my phone really helped me grow accustom to what I should expect from digital art programs for computers for half the price. You learn how to utilize layers, the mystical undo button, and their plethora of brushes without throwing $60(paint tool sai)-$500(some versions of photoshop) and makes it so you don't have to enter this new world blind and overwhelmed by new names, tools, and functions.  Onto the topic of ACTUAL art tablets, you need to know what you want out of your tablet. The Japanese company Wacom is famous for a reason, amazing products with a price range from $10USD(bamboo stylus for touch screens) to $3,000USD(their large Cintiqe 27QHD) with something for everyone. If you are looking for a tablet to introduce you to the medium, I would probably recommend their bamboo series as the appear to be the most popular. They are cheap, decent quality tablets with a good amount of features(can't find an average price sorry. I think it should be between 50$usd and 500$ I think). The next up in their line is their Intuos series, a kind of successor to bamboo, prices ranging between $80USD(Intuos pen small) and $500USD( Intuos pro pen and touch large). My best friend has an Intuos of her own and she loves it.  Onto MY favorite lineup, the Cintiq series. My main concern when I came to transferring from pen and paper to tablet and computer was the visual disconnect. With pen and paper, the lines I make are directly under my hand. With the average tablet, you are drawing to your left or right while seeing what you are drawing on screen. I couldn't see the difference between a 500$ tablet and a typical computer mouse. The Cintiqe functions as a second monitor that functions as a canvas. You get to see what you are drawing as it happens just like pen and paper, but with all the perks of drawing digitally. I personally own an Cintiq 13HD, burning 800$ hole in my wallet. But I absolutely LOVE it! It has a HIGH resolution display with customizable buttons off to the side(once you program them you will never go back). The box it comes in gives you a removable stand, pen case, screen cleaner, and all the cables you need. That's the only downside in my opinion. You don't really need to plug your sketchbook into a wall outlet, usb, and hdmi at the same time like you do with the Cintiq. While the cables are long enough to allow you some movement and the Cintiq itself has a bonus usb on itself as compensation, it can feel a little crowded. The pen for the Cintiq is AMAZING in my opinion. It has interchangeable tips and pressure sensitivity(pretty much Wacom standard now) You can change how tactile the pen feels when moving across the screen. Replicating the look and feel of drawing with an actual pen, marker, or brush. You can even flip the pen upside down to automatically switch between drawing an erasing mode! Talk about immersion. A step up from their Cintiq series is the Cintiq companions. A fully portably, self reliant, stand along tablet. Basically a glorified Microsoft surface iPad love child that you can use for useful stuff. I've never had hands on experience with one so I can't give that much insite. I'll stop gushing now.  In conclusion, a tablet is an investment you need to be ready for. While it's not like buying a house or a car, you still need to ask yourself many questions. ""Do I have to money to spare"" ""how often will I use it"" ""do I have the basic skills to try a different medium"" etc etc."
learnart,3ddmah,ChristieIsBored,3,Wed Jul 15 16:25:50 2015 UTC,"TL;DR  -Sorry I get really rambley. What I'm saying in a few short words is this:  -Get fundamentals down pat. Improve until you are confident in where you're at.  -Rather than throw your money at the first cheap tablet that comes around, save up for a higher end good quality one that will last for the long run and comes with features you really want. Maybe compromise for an app in the meantime."

I should clarify though, I was getting rid of the pages in my sketchbook not because they sketches were ugly, in fact most of them weren't sketches. They were things like paintings of lines because she would make us practice using different kinds of brushes which I agree is not a bad thing but the paint was ruining the sketchbook.  Regarding the tablets, I know Wacom has the best tablets and maybe you're right, I think I should wait until I can afford something better if the ones I'm looking at right now aren't too great."
learnart,3ddmah,EllJustin,2,Wed Jul 15 18:38:04 2015 UTC,I appreciate your long post. I've been searching the internet for Cintiq 13HD feedback which is how I ended up here haha. Thank you kindly.
learnart,3ddmah,ChristieIsBored,2,Fri Jul 17 03:43:17 2015 UTC,"Save up and go for it! It's the perfect size in my opinion, the screen is the exact same size as my sketchbook so the transition was easy. I DO run into issues every so often, but not without an easy fix. I'm really lazy, so it can take a little push for me to plug everything in and see if drivers need to be updated etc, but once I have everything hooked up I can spend days just drawing.  I use the art program ""Paint Tool SAI"" which was ¥6000 when I bought it. It runs great with all Wacom products and it quite a lot cheaper than photoshop. My typical setup is drawing with my cintiq on my lap and having Netflix running on my laptop nearby. I also have paint tool SAI hooked up through steam, so my friends can ask what I'm working on and know not to tempt me with match invites when I'm working.  My mother gifted me with a carrying case for my birthday a while ago. I'm not sure if it was made specifically for the 13HD, but it holds everything perfectly and makes portability that much easier. I can see if I can find out what it's called when I get home if you are interested, because it is a must have if you plan on buying a 13HD."
learnart,3ddmah,EllJustin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you can find out that would be excellent thanks. I can afford the 13HD because I just got done with school and I'm working full time. I said I wanted to start digital art a very long time ago and I'm in the position to devote some time to it. I have a custom PC with Paint tool Sai and Photoshop ready for it, don't you worry lol."
learnart,3ddmah,OhNoRhino,3,Sat Jul 18 04:58:13 2015 UTC,bamboo is a great starter dont worry about size of the tablet - just get a small one to get used to not looking at your pen while you draw (youll be looking at the screen) but yeah your main focus should stay with pen and paper - but the tablet is just so much fun!! EDIT - also dont worry about saving your sketches - think of them as studies - the sooner you can let go of them and start on the next drawing the better - or just focusing on filling a sketchbook then moving on to the next - save to see progress but dont linger too long on a drawing - youll get stuck

learnart,3ddmah,DrewNumberTwo,2,Wed Jul 15 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"If you are a beginner I'd personally recommend you to stick to traditional for a while. Fill a bunch of sketchbooks then once you have a basic foundation consider if you want to invest in a tablet.  I don't see a spectacular need for a tablet if you want to dabble into 3d modelling. While I'm not much of a modeller any more, I've never really felt a need to use a tablet for that purpose. Though I can see why some people might prefer it, I don't think a tablet is as mandatory for modelling as it is for digital painting in Photoshop. Again I'd recommend practicing with a mouse for a while so you can make a more informed decision on whether or not to invest money into a tablet.  I have never heard of the brand of tablets you mentioned, so I can't really comment on their quality. I can say that Wacom tablets are great and the industry standard though. While there is no specific need to get the best of the best, I'd at least recommend you do some research into the tablets you mentioned. Get a feel for how they stack up quality and feature wise against similar Wacom products. Also look around for second hand older generation Wacom tablets. Once you are more experienced and better informed you can probably make a better decision on what would give you the most 'bang for your buck'. Good luck!"
learnart,3ddmah,DrewNumberTwo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:58:30 2015 UTC,I genuinely thought 3D modelling can only be done properly with a tablet after I tried messing around in 3DS Max and Blender. I'll definitely try practising with a mouse more to see if i can get a hang of it. Thanks for the info!
learnart,3ddmah,cajolerisms,2,Wed Jul 15 18:48:38 2015 UTC,"So you're talking about getting a tablet to use with a 3d program? You can certainly do that, but most people use a mouse with those programs. A tablet might be more comfortable to you, but it really won't make a big difference like it would if you were working in a 2d program such as Photoshop."
learnart,3ddmah,dv12900,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"Really? O_o From what I've seen, most use tablets. I've always wondered how it was possible to make characters and objects in 3D programs using a mouse as I had a lot of trouble doing it so I naturally thought it was because using a mouse to sketch is so unnatural for me. I'll try practising more in Blender and 3DS Max to get better with a mouse."
learnart,3ddmah,dv12900,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:42:55 2015 UTC,I don think I've ever seen a person use a tablet for those programs. I did it for a while though. The motions are just very different. You don't need that kind of control over a line when you're working in 3d.
learnart,3ddmah,OhHiAndie,2,Wed Jul 15 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"Something really important regardless of whether you're drawing traditionally or digitally is to sketch everyday. Go get yourself a new sketchbook. Go to a dedicated art supply store and flip through them, hold them in your hand, get a feel for the paper. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, some of my favorites have been pretty cheap. It depends on what appeals to you.   Even if you're going to go digital, the thing is that you can't take your computer set up with you, and having a smaller sketchbook available for you to draw wherever you are is a very valuable learning tool that's worked for centuries for a reason.   It also sounds like in your enthusiasm to get some momentum, you're stretching yourself thin. There's no harm in playing around with digital and 3D, but don't let that distract you from really learning the basics."
learnart,3ddmah,OhHiAndie,5,Wed Jul 15 18:36:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, get a tablet. Start with a cheap, but durable one. If you have the choice of either cheap or durable, go for durable. Wacom is popular for a reason.  Another tip I'd give you is that you shouldn't be afraid of making terrible art. By ripping out the sketches you hated you're setting yourself up for disappointment."
learnart,3ddmah,OhHiAndie,2,Wed Jul 15 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. Just wanted to clarify that I wasn't ripping out sketches because they were ugly. Most weren't even sketches, they were things like painting many lines to practice using different types of brushes but the paint was messing up the sketchbook so I just had to get rid of it. I actually kept many sketches that I think aren't too good so it's not like I was trying to get rid of ugly sketches specifically."
learnart,3ddmah,OhHiAndie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:45:56 2015 UTC,Ah I get it. I mostly re-use old paper to exercise straight lines and circles and stuff. I agree that using a sketchbook for that feels like a waste.

Wacom is popular for a reason.   Listen to this, OP!  Between a cheap ""Cintiq"" alternative, and a legit Wacom Bamboo, I'd go with the Bamboo. The bigger one from a less popular brand might seem like a deal, but you never know what quality you're getting.   I've had my Bamboo for almost 4 years now, and it's served me well. Still going strong, works amazingly. Other people I know have gone through 2 or 3 non-Wacom tablets in that time."
learnart,3ddmah,dv12900,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, Bamboo's are fairly small. I was wondering, does the size of the tablet not matter as much as I was thought? I thought that a tablet the size of a Bamboo may be too small to sketch with and would only be ideal for notes. I'm guessing I'm wrong?  Edit: I realized there's more than one type of Bamboo tablet. I now know of the Bamboo Pad and the Bamboo Splash. Which one do you mean?"
learnart,3ddmah,hpizzle12,2,Wed Jul 15 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, no, I didn't mean the Pad. That's definitely too small, and only good for taking notes or signing stuff.  I have the Bamboo Create. It's no 27"" Cintiq, but it ain't small at all."
learnart,3dc6zw,ghosteagle,6,Wed Jul 15 03:16:46 2015 UTC,"Practice drawing everything. Steal what you like from your favorite artists and observe what you don't like and think about why it doesn't work for you. If you enjoy the process, you will do it more often and get better.  Draw game characters, but challenge yourself to break them down into their primitive geometric shapes. Think about them in 3d space, and try to draw them from different angles or in different poses.  Draw from life too, it's excellent practice if you want to improve quickly."

learnart,3dc6zw,Noxate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:54:01 2015 UTC,"Instead of directly copying other pictures, maybe try copying their art style. If you draw something in a completely different pose but still manage to get it to look like it's in the same art style, you'll learn a lot more, as opposed to copying specific drawings down to every detail.  Drawing from life is more important though. Even if you want to draw in exaggerated art styles, drawing from life helps with things like anatomy and perspective, which can be useful in any art style."
learnart,3dc6zw,GoEnzoGo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:43:28 2015 UTC,"Go for it. Its good practice. You'll want to do live studies and draw from photographs too, but practice making dupes can certainly speed up your understanding of styles and techniques. Of course only copying other artists may not to lead to artistic mastery by itself, but if you just like drawing scenes or posters of beloved video game characters then you're golden."
learnart,3dcbh2,Mxdden,3,Wed Jul 15 03:55:22 2015 UTC,"Representational art styles are based on reality. While the final picture in a manga might look 'simplistic', it takes a very solid foundation in art to get to that point. The artist needs to know anatomy, gesture, proportions, perspective, light, etc. to understand how a certain pose would look in real life. He can then take that basis and start altering the proportions, simplifying the anatomy, pushing the gesture, etc. Because he understands reality he can make informed decisions on what to simplify into his style.  A novice artist might take that finalised image and do a reasonable direct copy of it. However when asked to change the pose or alter the lighting a novice artist often will run into trouble. Not understanding the original 3d form or how light would affect that form will make it very hard to know where to put the shading.   You might be able to look at an artist and see how he shaded his drawing (or any other aspect really) but without studying fundamentals you won't be able to * know * why he did things a certain way.  Using reference is certainly a part of drawing or making art in general. However unless you enjoy directly stealing other people's work it should be accompanied by your own skills to create something new. While doing a direct copy is great for training your observational drawing skills, it obviously isn't a way to create original work. Therefore no, it isn't 'what drawing is', it is merely an (optional) part of it.  Copics are fun. So are colored pencils if you have the patience. Both can to their own degree be quite an investment though. Therefore consider starting with pen or pencil and paper first. Once you are ready to move onto markers, consider starting out in greyscale or monochrome. That way you don't need to invest too much right away."

learnart,3da8ck,Scoutrageous,4,Tue Jul 14 19:28:11 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are if you're not already loving to draw with a pencil/paint etc there's a big chance that you could waste a large chunk of money on a tablet that you will likely abandon from simply not liking to draw in the first place.  You don't ""think about"" getting into art. If you like it, you'd be drawing. (do or do not, there is no try!... or think about!) It seems like you've idealized the end result of being an artist rather than loving and wanting to do the process itself. Tablets are not a fast track to being a good artist.  Traditional really does have many advantages for teaching beginners over digital too. Among other things, Traditional is simplified with less distraction from the key pillars of art, and it's anywhere any time.  I drew all the time from when i was little and ended up getting a tablet at age 13. almost six years later I still draw traditionally too. Here's a progression"
learnart,3da8ck,Scoutrageous,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:15:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I do hear what you're saying.

Same goes with any other hobby somebody might want to get into. Can't always start off with loving it =). Though you are right in that I have idealized the end results of artists I've found. I'm going to give it a go and start with traditional but have the tablet to play around with. I may end up loving art or I may end up getting tired of it, at least I'll know I tried! Besides, the tablet is only like $100."

The amount of work that's required to become a good artist requires a strong love of the process to have the motivation to actually do the hard yards.   If you're not liking to work traditionally right now, that's a big red flag that it could be a waste of money. A pencil and paper is less than two dollars."

You can try it out yourself before making a big commitment (like a wacom, etc.) by downloading a free or cheap drawing app for ipad or android tablet (and getting yourself a cheap stylus). I do all my art directly on my ipad now using sketchbook pro and then exporting to photoshop for text and effects.

It doesn't give you the sensitivity or functionality of wacom-type stylus, but as you can see, it's capable of doing fairly detailed and complex illustrations for a fraction of the cost. Since I'm not concerned with print and I'm not going for professional-level illustration, this setup has worked for me. At the very least, it should give prospective creators looking to go digital a sense of what the process is like before dropping big bucks on a wacom or its like.  http://www.amazon.com/Ten-One-Design-Sketch-stylus/dp/B002Q6GGZO"
learnart,3da8ck,DrawsACartoon,2,Wed Jul 15 02:04:50 2015 UTC,"Everyone of course is saying to start traditional first, but don't mistake that meaning you're only going to make something good with that route. In fact, I feel it's actually the opposite.  Digital art with a tablet is ""easy"". Shading in particular, whereas traditionally you have to worry a lot about the medium (charcoal, graphite) and the technique, in Photoshop it's literally just a few clicks away. You have to try numerous times to make a decent gradient of color in paint, in Photoshop nothing is quicker. Every time you made a mistake you could just use undo and forget about it, but you wouldn't improve much.  And in other places, digital art with a tablet is hard. Line work for instance. A lot of artists actually do their line work on paper and then scanned them. Unless you get a Cintiq or any tablet with a screen, drawing in them really takes time to get used to. It's just unnatural. I already started to learn to draw for about a year and a half, and even then when I got my first tablet my drawing there still sucked. It really takes time to get used to, and for someone with 0 art experience as you said that actually might be demoralizing."

learnart,3da8ck,Jamaz,2,Wed Jul 15 13:26:11 2015 UTC,"Photoshop and a surface pro 2. No guides just lots and lots of reading on theory.   Here's a breakdown of my process from a previous comment.   I refreshed a bit of reading of traditional (non-digital) methods before starting here, which helped me to recognise different light/colour ect. I've been editing images for years and years, and playing in Photoshop since I was about 5-6 years old (when I outgrew KidPix), so I know the program and some colour/light/form theory well from my experience there.  I work in photoshop CS2, on a Windows Surface Pro 2, with their pressure sensitive pen, which isn't the best, but does ok.    My workflow is basically this,    Find nice source image to study make it simple there's no shame in starting at the beginning. :)  Open source image and a new canvas in PS (I used A4 300dpi) side by side. Create background by painting in the various colours of the background (until you get your eye in for selecting colour, perhaps use the colour picker tool on your scource image to help you recognise differences in shade?)  I then make a silhouette of the shape I'm painting on a new layer, refine that and lock the transparent pixels of that layer.  It's then a matter of observe and translate. (I used almost exclusively a hard round (PS default) brush set at around 30% Opacity and 30% Flow and varied it in size as appropriate) Find the differences in colour and light and rough them into your painting, ensuring you get them in the right place. Build up the complexity, ensure you capture everything.  Don't worry about blending it all together as you go, I stop and do this in stages, in the following manner; At a point where two colours meet, with that brush I described above, select one side of the colour (hold alt to flick to the eyedropper tool while in brush mode) and paint that colour lightly over the join in colour. Then select the new colour you've created on the other side of your line where the colours meet (which should be roughly half way between your two initial colours that you're trying to blend) and paint this over the top of the join line, heavily. Then repeat on the new join you've make,  and repeat and repeat until it's all blended.     Other notes,   Zoom out often. Your eye is much better at determining oddness in light and colour when it's 'far away' and you're seeing the whole picture.   Avoid zooming in. I don't think I zoomed in closer than having the whole canvas on the screen more than 3 times on the gold ball, and never on the egg."

I drew very little in high school and couldn't dedicate time to it since I wanted to focus on a more stable career. Bought a Wacom Intuos4 three years ago for fun, and been on and off just learning on my own exclusively with digital. I draw anime/manga style characters and post them on an amateur JRPG-making forum. Here's something I did last year http://i.imgur.com/wybnIIO.png  . It's passable enough that people put my drawings in free/hobby games, but I'd eventually like to make art worth putting in indie-games or a popular desktop wallpaper - hopefully in 5-10 years, lol.  I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me, but I feel the only reason traditional art is pushed so hard is because it's what all the professionals/adepts had to do when they were younger since digital wasn't popular 1-2 decades ago. That and the fact that colleges and art studios don't even offer digital art specialization - unless its photoediting or learning to use the hardware. Digital painting/drawing courses are super rare. I'm sure the fundamentals taught in traditional art classes are still incredibly important - depth, perception, lighting, etc. I just find it very awkward having to draw on a huge 1.5' x 2' physical canvas and not have the technique transition well to a 8""x6"" tablet where I'm not even drawing on the monitor.

You should paint from good quality reference, such as a clear photograph or a live model. This is because you will not produce something as good as the original, so if you are starting from a flawed original in the first place (the simple cat sketch) your work will be of a lesser quality.   Get some good, clear photos of what you want to paint and practice sketching them first.

learnart,3d8y71,Toldea,2,Tue Jul 14 13:22:26 2015 UTC,"I think you've gotten some great advice, such as starting with the basics and just sketching a lot. I do have to say though, that I commend your work and think this is great for a first painting. After you've worked on your sketching skills, you may find yourself coming back to a more simplified style, which is fine."

learnart,3d8y71,carl2431,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:49:05 2015 UTC,"Hello,  I have noticed a trend on this subreddit.  Most people, if they see you are a clear beginner but attempting a finished piece, will tell you to go back and learn fundementals because that is how you get to be a good artist.  Thats what they did. For thousands of hours.  However, this is Artcrit, not artistcrit so I will give some feedback on this particular piece.  If you look at the line art, the line that makes the bridge of the nose stops.  The upper outline of the head is acutally the other eyebrow of the cat.  You seem to have transposed the bridge of the nose directly into the top of the cat's head leading your drawing to have 2 perspecives.  the mouth is slightly facing the camera, but the top siloette looks profiled.    I also notice a hard blue line between the cat and the background.  I would have simply allowed the background texture to meet the cat.  Personally I feel the hard line looks lazy.  There is no reason to not be proud of this piece although from a professional level, it wont hang in a gallery.  Just keep trying and learning from feedback like this."

learnart,3d55qb,BenBrommell,3,Mon Jul 13 16:38:31 2015 UTC,Let me try. I think he is using thinned oil paint or acrylic and subtractive drawing method with that paint. When I Google subtractive oil painting I come up with some results. But this type of painting reminds me of the American street graffiti artist who use tools to make a quick painting in  5 minutes. And for some reason they always make landscapes. Here's a video of an artist in myanmar that says it's an oil painting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riFX94JaJ6o
learnart,3d55qb,TheMaddLib,4,Mon Jul 13 20:10:30 2015 UTC,"I'd agree, based on the video in the comments. Watered down/thinned oil, acrylic, or maybe gouache?  He probably mixed a dark green, thinned it, and then set to painting. A flat brush, a large round brush, and a palette knife are the only tools you'd need, I think. Scratch in the light shapes quickly before the paint dries.  The rest is just his personal skill and style.  The paintings you bought look almost like ink, but it's probably just thinned oil or acrylic. No idea if it's possible to do subtractive stuff with ink (scratching light shapes out with a knife)."
learnart,3d55qb,SamadeusLux,3,Mon Jul 13 21:10:19 2015 UTC,Here is a video I have found on YouTube of a start-to-finish Burmese painting that'll hopefully help shed some more light to those who can explain what's actually happening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riFX94JaJ6o

learnart,3d55qb,mylicenseisexpired,2,Mon Jul 13 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"I don't recall the smell of them, but as he finished a painting he put it out in the sun to dry for about fifteen-twenty minutes or so before he could roll it up."
learnart,3d55qb,jack-dawed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:51:11 2015 UTC,"Drying that quickly doesn't really sound like an oil based paint, but I could be wrong.  Oil dries by oxidation and usually takes a few hours even for the thinnest paints.  I would lean towards an ink, acrylic or gouache.  Just looking at the tone of the samples makes me think this is a thinned printer's ink like would be used to print newspapers."
learnart,3d55qb,Thyrsus24,2,Mon Jul 13 23:09:01 2015 UTC,The technique is called sgraffito. The reason there's no real Western name for this Burmese style is because the artist uses a mixture of techniques.
learnart,3d6090,morgenro,2,Mon Jul 13 20:11:44 2015 UTC,"As throawaya said, don't be afraid to jump in.  Practicing fundamentals is really important.  But so is having fun, staying motivated, and seeing what gives you trouble.  For instance if your doing a study of a character but are having a hard time getting the arm to look right it might show you that a cylinder is where you need to work on.  Is it the shading or shape?  Maybe it's the connection to the shoulder so you need to mess with cylinders with globes connected etc.  I mean don't limit yourself to characters, or still life, or shapes.  Make sure and mix it up, it'll help keep your mind making the connections between how the practice relates to the other parts as well."

Start with simple forms like bugs(spiders, ants, etc) then move to animals (rhinos, gators) and transition over to figure drawing, portraiture, clothing, etc Learn basic perspective. You're not going to use advanced architect stuff but you don't want your characters to look flat or floating on the paper either. Build a really good visual library.

If you want to be a concept artist, I'd say mix in some design challenges in there aswell.  Drawing is a must for this field, but so is design.  I'd personally say to get a spare sketch book and maybe every day or every few days give yourself a challenge to fill up a few pages.  For example, on the top of the page label it character design and limit yourself, ""I have been assigned to design a robot set in an 80's themed future aimed at taking out aircraft and land vehicles"" or something.  I think these challenges are pretth fun, and come out with some interesting results in the end.  Good luck c:"
learnart,3d55ok,redeye998,6,Mon Jul 13 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"The ""problem"" is that I am not able to draw from imagination.   Your larger problem is that you appear to be under the impression that artists work purely from imagination.  There may be a few savants out there but for the vast majority that's just not how it works.  Take your cyber thing for example, if you're bothered by the lack of hands and feet then why didn't you find references for the pose and adapt them to your design?  I'm not talking about copying either.    Take one of the greats, Norman Rockwell.  He didn't just sit down with his imagination and go, he came up with a concept, developed references using models and setups he arranged himself and used those tools to create his composition.  He didn't perfectly copy his references either, instead making changes as needed to get the right mood.  Even in concept art don't think for a second that professionals don't use references to study lighting, depth and color when developing alien landscapes or fairylands.  Don't assume that creature designers are exempt from studying human, animal and even plant biology to come up with new ways to build a living being.  TL;DR Don't try to force yourself to live up to a standard that doesn't exist in the professional art world.   I'm doing this for only 2 months and I don't really practice.   Don't do that.  Can you become a soccer player by watching games and never touching a ball yourself?  No you learn the rules AND go out and drill the skills until you get the muscle memory to do it without thinking.  Why would art be any different?     Should I do value studies or sketches (which I'm terrible at)? What first and what last? Do I even use the correct brush with proper settings?   Study everything.  You have a decent start but you're green in all the fundamentals.  I'd consider taking a beginner drawing course, too many of your exercises are trying to start six steps ahead of your skill level and it's just going to frustrate you.   I am afraid it is too late... I should be making money right now... I should have a job and make a living... Plus, I want to! Do I stand a chance? Should I just quit and try something related to my degree?   Get a day job.  You may very well stand a chance but you're not ready to make a living off of this yet. With an economics degree you're in a good position to pay the bills while you learn, plus you should be able to get a head for the business end of things while you're at it."
learnart,3d55ok,EctMills,0,Mon Jul 13 17:53:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! I am not under the impression that you stated above. I completely understand how it works, and my query is based on that... (do I have to draw a million references in order to be able to ""guess"" it?). About getting a day job... Well, too bad I am Greek and I live in Greece in the worst time period ever... What do I have to draw now? Where to start?"
learnart,3d55ok,EctMills,2,Mon Jul 13 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"That's just it, you shouldn't ever need to guess.  Either you use references to know the pose or you get to the point where through sheer experience and knowledge of form you know the pose without references.  The latter takes decades of work so don't push for it, use the tools available to you.  I can understand dealing with terrible economies, I graduated shortly before the housing bubble burst here.  Sadly bad economies generally make for even worse job prospects in the art world than other industries.  If you want to try freelancing online job boards is your best bet but fair warning it's not a stable income.  Even people with experience have dry months and use day jobs to mitigate that. Your economics degree should be a big help but I wish you the best of luck either way."
learnart,3d55ok,theburritoman,3,Mon Jul 13 21:29:30 2015 UTC,"Drawing anything from imagination takes years and years of continuous drawing, studying, and observing. You're not going to have this skill in a couple of months time. The skill will come if you put the work in though.  Your values are still off. Squint your eyes when you look at an image. This helps you distinguish the values by blurring the details so that you are only able to see the big shapes/blobs of value. When you're doing this, compare one area to another. Is the area i'm looking at darker or lighter than the area next to it? Is this area a mid tone between these other to spots of value? Always try to compare one thing to another.  This rule can also be used to drawing. Can I ask, are you tracing? I ask because of a couple of reasons. First, the drawings are pretty close to the image but your values and rendering skills aren't as strong as your drawing replication skill. That is, you get a very strong likeness to your source material but aren't able to render that drawing out. Also, a lot of your edges are really sharp which leads me to believe that you drew the image, selected the border, and filled it in with color. Ideally, you want to strengthen your drawing skills first before you work on painting. Working with lines is, generally speaking, a prerequisite to working with value and color. If you ARE tracing, try to see if you can draw your reference without it. If you AREN'T tracing, try not to focus on details like skin wrinkles and hair strands.  Also, you're going to want to use better reference material. The 2 images of the girls (first and last) are good images to really study values. There's a good range of dark and light values (moreso in the first one) and have good depth of field (sharp areas and blurred areas). The 3 images in the middle are pretty bad. The floating male is a pretty amorphous image of a human with no real definition, the in-game screen shots are small representations of complex figures so its hard to really read them. The hooded female is very pixelated and the split image that seems to have been made up of two different pictures.  You're going to want to find images with good lighting that shows distinct light and darks and that aren't pixelated or distorted in anyway. Preferably of real people and objects. It's actually better if you set up your own still life of objects that you can use a lamp to shine light on. This way, you can better study how light works. Pictures are fine, but they're just not as valuable as studying an object that's right in front of you.  Basically, you have to know reality before you can construct imaginary things. You have to know how things work in real life. Only after you're able to see and understand the basic principles of light, color, perspective, form, anatomy, etc., along with art concepts like composition and technique will you be able to apply that knowledge to concept art work.  You're JUST starting your journey so don't expect to land a job tomorrow. Don't expect to land a job in a year or even several. There is just so much to learn from the beginning that it takes a long time and a lot of effort. If you DO want to get a job soon, you have to, quite literally, draw and paint every hour that you're awake for the next year or so. There's only one way to get to the top and that's through work. That's it. If you're worried about money, which is a very real concern for everyone and shouldn't be taken lightly, find a job that pays the bills and work on your art in your free time.  Moving forward, if you really want to do this, you absolutely CAN'T worry about what anyone else thinks of you or your work. All that matters is that you're working and trying to better yourself and your art. Continue to go to places like this subreddit and look for critique and advice. It'll take work for you, like everyone else, but it IS possible to do. Just go do the work!"
learnart,3d55ok,throawaya0101,0,Mon Jul 13 17:59:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply!   Can I ask, are you tracing?   No. I was told that once before but I don't even get how to trace values. On the very first image, I traced the eye shape, but that's all. What I do is to take the my painting layer and slide it on top of the reference for 1 sec to see if I'm getting it right (when it's still rough). In the other images, I might ""marked"" some spots on where an edge should start or smth like that (like that red character's spikes on his back). Since each piece took me many hours (from 6h to 2 days), I had the time to ""make it right"".   you drew the image, selected the border, and filled it in with color.   I only did that with that Sniper girl. I never do that, I don't like that technique at all, but I see many youtubers doing it, so I had to try once. My way is like that: I start from a feature, draw every single detail and then move to the other one. If you had the chance to look at an unfinished work, you would see half of being finished and the other one being a stupid sketch. After everything has a decent shape, I try adding more details.   The hooded female is very pixelated and the split image that seems to have been made up of two different pictures.   Yeap, it's 2 different characters that I combined into one, as an idea that I had on that day - combine 2 hooded females :)  It's Sylvanas and Valla (from Warcraft and Diablo Universe / Heroes of the Storm)  Final version: http://imgur.com/ORayNsL"
learnart,3d55ok,throawaya0101,3,Mon Jul 13 21:21:02 2015 UTC,"I immediately recognized most of your stuff is traced assisted. You're showing really strong skills in construction but making obvious simple mistakes on line weight and values. It's fine to use as a professional when you're facing a tough deadline or a stubborn client, but not when you're a complete beginner.   Stop using the tablet for now to prevent any trace assistance temptation like drawing on top of a referenced image and just use a basic sketchbook."

You're not using hand eye coordination to problem solve your weak spots. You're using a built in blueprint (the reference image) and automatically trouble shooting it. It's like saying you're learning math by using a calculator.   You have to realize the planning the drawing is where the real learning is. Things like how to draw eyes, how that eye relates to the  nose/ears/mouth, or where to place spikes, or where to start/finish a line. It's all design decisions and you can't just turn your brain off and follow a blueprint. You need to think about it.  I don't mean to insult, but the dangers of trace assisted learning for beginners is devastating. It gives you the false sense of accomplishment without actually learning the real fundamentals."
learnart,3d55ok,DaymanMaster0fKarate,0,Mon Jul 13 22:52:37 2015 UTC,"Moving your layer on top of the reference for a while and compare it is more like using a calculator for checking if you got the same results, not copying the result. If I don't get it right, I don't trace on top of it like a blueprint, but try for hours and hours to get it right. In fact, I had seen in a tutorial that it is OK for a beginner to check your reference sketches that way.  I know what you are trying to say and I don't doubt it at all. On top of that, I had a very tough moment on the ""tracing"" topic and I knew I was never going to actually trace. I don't want to cheat my own self anyway...  Thank you for your addition!"

Don't do this, instead practice measuring with your eyes or with a pencil, and do more, shorter sketches where you practice this instead of one really long picture.  Repetition and iteration always help me learn a lot faster.

learnart,3d55ok,DaymanMaster0fKarate,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:09:25 2015 UTC,"I think you're getting too focused on ""Making it right.""  When you're first starting out, your goal should NOT be to make pretty pictures. Your goal should be to learn.  If you're worried about getting everything just right, I think that shows a couple of things.    You're working from a reference that's too difficult for your skill set. You're spending time trying to get the image ""just right"" which means you're worrying about the specifics instead of getting the most important part of the exercises.   It's good that you're experimenting with different techniques and possibilities of getting to the end product, but I think you should start somewhere more simple. Try rendering simple shapes like spheres, boxes, pyramids, etc. This will be fairly tedious but doing these is absolutely necessary if you're going to grasp how light works, and thus, proper values. Once you're getting the hang of stuff like highlights, lights, midtones, core shadows, reflected light, occlusion shadows, etc., you can start to apply that to your figure studies and drawings.  If you're serious about making art for a living, there is no short cut. All of those great artists, including concept artists, are very versed in art fundamentals.  Also, as you're doing these studies, try drawing anything and everything. Do you like fantasy video games and Game of Thrones? Look up pictures of your favorite characters and draw them and pay attention to their armor, weaponry, facial features. Do you like fantastic creatures? Go study animals, the way the run, sit, act. Every imaginary thing is created through knowledge of real things."

When should I try to add any kind of value? These questions might seem easy but everything is chaotic on my head...

I'd recommend putting yourself through some online courses so you have more guidance about technique, theory, subject matter. Not talking about MOOCs or Udemy. More like classes on Skillshare, or signing up for Schoolism's new subscription model. Both are very reasonable investments in your education ($10-15 / month).  There's also the completely free and amazing Ctrl+Paint.com. Not sure if you're into traditional or digital drawing / painting, but Matt Kohr who runs the site covers but traditional fundamentals as well as the more technical photoshop stuff (which you can just skip if you're more into analog mediums).  Youtube also has plenty fo free content & tutorial videos for all sorts of drawing specialities - eg. Proko teaches human anatomy / drawing the figure. Concept Cookie teaches conceptual character design. Plenty more if you search around / the big reddit list is here.  Lastly keep yourself motivated and filled with new subject matter to practice drawing by joining in on r/SketchDaily or the SketchDailies feed on Twitter. Helps a ton to draw alongside other people and share progress.   Hope that helps!"

I had been looking into doing digital art but had read, and agreed with the fact that traditional should be learnt first.   Thanks for the help I will take a look at all the resources you provided"
learnart,3cyy1e,Clawse,6,Sun Jul 12 12:04:08 2015 UTC,"Watch movies, tv shows, etc. and pause them. Sketch facials, sketch posture, sketch bodies, sketch stills. Sketch real life people stopped in motion to get a better understanding for the body.  Definitely go on a lot of websites such as Drawspace and other helpful drawing websites, look at free courses online you'll have time to do (which REALLY help with concepts, drawing skills, and just everything - making art as well as understanding it), and maybe buy a couple of the highest-acclaimed books in the art world (a lot of drawing books are bs!). Stay motivated, keep all your work to reflect on, explore new medium.s Good luck!"

Thanks for your help"
learnart,3cyy1e,morgenro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:09:16 2015 UTC,"Oh no!! It's actually quite simple and it's a task recommended to beginners to get a good grasp of people (I'm a novice myself!). What you do is you just do a super rough sketch, outlines even, of the person/people in the shot. Just a quick 30 second sketch of their posture/gesture/action. They don't have to be good, and you can chuck them out after, but it really really helps with getting a feel for the human body and proportions and posture and poses, and eventually feeling natural when it comes to drawing bodies."

If you aren't enjoying making it then, yeah, you might want to quit. Hobbies should be enjoyable.   However, if its the lack of an audience that is making you unhappy then you just need to search for communities online that you can post your work to, tag the hell out of it, and spend time promoting yourself. Artists with big audiences don't get them by accident, it can take work. Find specific subreddits to post to, find Tumblr tags, Deviant Art groups, related forums, ANYTHING. If you do NSFW/nude art there are a lot of communities for that out there on the web, you just have to find them. Also, don't be afraid to contact artists with similar content, networking is helpful.   My last suggestion would be to consider combining your writing and art. Illustrated stories or webcomics are pretty cool and might help bring a spark back for you."

The webcomic community also seems really great about networking, especially if you're willing to reach out to people and do guest comic trades or link to each others' sites.

The only problem is that it's SO MUCH work to do a comic rather than a bunch of standalone pieces. Plus, like I said, I'm already writing a book. However, I like the idea of doing a separate comic that ties into the book. Maybe I'll try it again but doing all the writing, drawing, coloring/painting, etc. myself is an overwhelming thought..."

I kind of do it to pretend I'm doing productive with my time. At the same time, I'm not really doing anything to help my life out in a positive way. Its as if the past 8 months of my life were an attempt to ""draw myself out"" of my isolation.  What I'm learning now is that art making needs to come from a positive place. For me, that positive place won't exist unless I take measures to improve my life in areas that I previously tried to ignore. I honestly don't even know if I actually want to make art, I just use drawing as an escape mechanism like I previously used video games and TV. So that's my advice. Look if there are other areas in your life that are upsetting you and spend time working on those instead of escaping them with art."

I've seen the stuff you've posted and you have a unique view point and potential to improve. If you are suffering from depression or anxiety, please consider going to a doctor because you will feel better.   Two, I'm going to be straight with you. Making a career in art takes a ridiculous amount of motivation and self-driven work. You do not have to be great, but you do have to have hustle. A junior designers in NYC makes $30-35k on average, which is enough to cover you necessities and have some to spare for fun. If you're smart and driven, additional freelancing and passive income can push that up to $40k. If you build a strong portfolio and CV, within 5-8 years you can be an art director.   The people who are able to make a living as artists and designers are people who always push themselves to work smarter and better. Art and design is a rapidly changing field so the people who keep up are people who are always learning new skills. They are almost always not the best, but they put themselves out there, they learn from their mistakes, they learn from peers, they network, they deal with rejection and keep going.   Honestly if you don't think you have it in you to always push yourself even when no one else will, then art is not the field for you."

learnart,3czec7,SwordOfTheLlama,2,Sun Jul 12 13:32:02 2015 UTC,"Hi Saundersaur If you can't enjoy drawing and creating anymore, take a break :) Everyone who likes creating will get to a point, where they need a break and that's totally fine and absolutly normal! Or try something new, start sculpting for a little while, try mixing techniques or material, experiment.  If you're trying to monetize your artwork, let me put it like this: As stated by various people in the comments, it's hard (but not impossible) to earn enough to live. However earning money with something so self-driven like art is always hard and requires, well, a lot of self-driven work and practice. There's no recipe and there is no secure income. It's a risk and it depends, on how determinded you are, to take this risk. If you 'lack' worth, because 'nobody' is looking at your pictures on the internet: Join a real life drawing group. Srsly, you will boost your own skill, and you will be able to help other people with your art indirectly :) No art is worthless, it's communication, and communication is precious.  The internet is a place, where professionals display their artwork. So yes, there are ""better"" artists here, as there is anywhere else on the world. BUT don't look at them like rivals. They're your friends, and you can learn a lot by looking at the 'better' artwork.   And let me tell you this as an art student: Audience won't help the feeling of being lost and disenchanted. Creating art is not a 'Audience'-issue, it's, and i can't emphasize enough, communication. If you feel, nobody is interested in your art, it in some degree also means, you are not sure, if anyone is interested in what you have to say to the world. Don't feel this way. Especially not on the internet, where there is so much information accesible by anyone. As stated before, start small, search for a local group to paint and draw, join sketching sessions, sign up for a painting class, and if it's hard, start an online 'drawing' group. You won't just gain an audience, but friends and good souls who will help you improving. And believe me, THAT boosts your motivation more than any random comment on a forum :)  Edit: please do ignore my typos, english isn't my mother tongue"

learnart,3czec7,Madkat124,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:41:11 2015 UTC,"I considered going into graphic design, but I know it's mostly freelance   Nope. I don't know where you're getting this information, but it's wrong. There are thousands upon thousands of in-house marketing departments and advertising agencies that hire graphic designers.   it's not something you can make a living off off. I would need another job to pay the bills no matter what if I did went into graphic design.   Nope. I worked with a team of graphic designers and we all got full-health benefits, a great salary and raises and retirement funding.   I'm currently writing a book I plan on getting published, but I also know that I will still need a day job ...   Nope. Many writers scale back their life and expenses and live very modestly. Steven Pressfield lived in a van and typed on an manual underwood typewriter. He wrote The Legend of Bagger Vance.  People who draw appreciate the greater benefits of delayed gratification. These people don’t care how well others can draw; they focus on personal “little victories” and getting a little bit better each year. They know in five years they may even be better than most. When they get to that long-term goal these people challenge themselves even more and surround themselves with better artists to learn even more. Ignoring the shallow benefits of immediate gratification, for the more satisfying long-term benefits, trains your brain & willpower be even stronger.  People who draw well define self-worth on personal measurements of success that aren’t based on someone else’s approval. You do this by determining problems and setting objectives that lead to your ultimate personal goal. When you set personal goals, and with hard work and dedication attain those goals, others successes become motivation (e.g. if they can draw that good by working hard, it proves that I will be able to do it to if I work as hard!)   Drawing can actually boost your self-esteem which may improve your self-worth. Drawing and making mistakes go hand-in-hand. If you want to avoid making mistakes, then you will not learn to draw. Embrace mistakes and weaknesses and forge them into strengths. Here’s Rocky explaining how winnin’ is done.   Everyone suffers at some point with anxiety. It’s a myth that the pros reach easy street. The artists who embrace mistakes and bumps in the road, who drive on through the stormy weather, are the ones who continue to make art. A.) Every day great artists with amazing ability quit and find “real” jobs. B.) Every day average artists work through mistakes, fear and overwhelming obstacles to make great art.  People who draw well love drawing. These people appreciate the benefits of a long-term relationship with drawing. Like the mature love of people in long relationships, a mature love of drawing is: patient, kind, it doesn’t envy or boast and is never proud. These people aren’t self-seeking.   If the goal of your relationship, and drawing, is just ""measuring up to others"" and if they are the main reason why you want to learn to draw – then your motivation is superficial, shallow and basically just a dick measuring contest. Mature love of drawing always perseveres through the drama."

I have to ask, do you still want to do art as a career buy feel like you can't cut it, or do you actually just want to do it as a hobby? What would you want to do instead? It might seem like random questions, but I'm generally curious, because I can relate to the former.   What kind of writing do you do? Depending on what it is, it might be a good idea to transfer it to (web)comic form somehow, as others have recommended.   ""I've already heard all the ""Make your art for you"" advice and everything like that. But essentially I just don't matter and my art is worthless. There are hundreds of better artists than me""  Honestly, I wouldn't take the ""Make art for you"" advice very literally. Personally, I want to entertain and tell a story with my work. The way I see it, making art for myself means making something that I'd want to see. I will be telling you that being a ""good"" artist is subjective. What does being good constitute? Technical skill, composition, meaning? When it comes down to it, no one else can make your art, and when it comes to your art, you've got a certain style and such, if that makes sense.

Value has nothing to do with saturation, so no you can still use anything from completely desaturated to fully saturated.  Check out CtrPaint.com if you are new to Photoshop. That site probably will answer the majority of the questions you have plus teach you about a lot of features you might not know.  What brush you use of course matters. Different brushes will give you different effects and will be more or less effective for certain tasks. If you are new though try to stick with just standard hard and soft brushes. Experiment with opacity and flow settings and try to get a good feel for how both function before diving into highly customised brushes."

learnart,3cty74,DracoX872,5,Fri Jul 10 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"Frankly, you can waste a lot of time looking at other art, watching how-to videos and visiting artist websites, but as a beginner the ONLY THING that will help you improve is just cranking out the drawings for a bit. Don't over think it, over analyze yourself, and most importantly don't compare your progress with others.   Relish the idea that you are creating and having fun. Soon you'll get a feel for handling the charcoal and your eye hand coordination will get better. If you don't have one, buy a basic how-to book and read it and do the exercises. You won't understand it all but the more your eye and mind work, the better you'll understand it. Reading and watching tutorials is fine, but it must be accompanied by regular, steady work. Good drawing."
learnart,3cty74,JustToLurkArt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:38:50 2015 UTC,"What you are doing isn't far off base. In our first drawing class in college it was all in charcoal. We started off first with drawing straight lines then transitioned into two point linear perspective drawing of simple boxes. From there we went to calligraphic line drawings of our hands where there was no shading, shadow and pressure were implied by controlling the weight of the line.    The next project we did was to make 3 sets of 6 boxes. We left the first one blank and made the last box of each set totally black and filled in the rest with varying tones ranging from white to completely dark. The different sets were for different ways of filling in the boxes i.e. fill and smudge, hatch, and cross hatch. This really helped me understand the way that charcoal lay'd down and what could be done with it as a working medium.    The best you can really find is that it helps to set a ground. 1. Lay a light layer of charcoal down across the whole paper. This helps to differentiate the background from the subject later on especially for expressing highlights. We used a paper towel to smear it around to keep the oils on our hands from soaking into the paper and making it work oddly. The ground can be darker if you'd like depending on how you want to deal with cast shadows by the object. 2. Outline the basic shapes lightly. These should disappear in the final rendering if done correctly. At the final stage you don't want to be able to see any lines created in drawing the subject. You want the image to feel natural and if your subject doesn't have a strange line in it your render shouldn't either. This is also the stage where you correct errors that will ruin the illusion of the object before you go any further. 3. Work in the 3 values, shadow, main body, and lights into your shapes to establish the subject. 4. Lay in details until your sick of doing it i.e. fine details, textures, and so forth.    Some tools of the trade that worked for us were; 1. charcoal pastels, used to lay in the ground. 2. charcoal pencils, we used prang soft peel n sketch. 3. kneaded rubber eraser. 4. I found it easy to have an additional assortment of erasers for different things however others were just fine with taking the white vinyl erasers and cutting them up as needed for their work.    I hope this helps a little, if you have any other questions feel free to ask."
learnart,3cu4y4,Skariliak,7,Fri Jul 10 20:12:32 2015 UTC,Going through some of the lessons on /r/ArtFundamentals might be beneficial for you. Otherwise try not to overcomplicate things. Instead try to think of ways to isolate problems into their smallest forms.  If you know little about value then simply don't include it into your figure drawings. Just stick to linework. When you are ready to learn about value and light then don't jump directly into figures but practice with primitive geometric forms first.  Start with simple front view 'anatomical pose' drawings to cut out perspective and foreshortening problems. Get your basic proportions this way. Then when you are ready learn about perspective. Again by practicing with primitive forms first before moving to the figure.  Whenever you are seriously struggling try to identify what aspects you are lacking in. Then think of a way to cut out all of those aspects so you can take the time to slowly learn then in isolation before gradually bringing them back in.
learnart,3cu4y4,Toldea,2,Fri Jul 10 21:10:11 2015 UTC,Try Stan Prokopenko's videos: http://www.proko.com/library/   Also Matt Kohr at Ctrl Paint (http://www.ctrlpaint.com/library/) is great.  His emphasis is not on figure drawing as much but he has a lot of excellent videos on a range of drawing subjects.
learnart,3cu4y4,Zaxacarian,2,Fri Jul 10 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"Stick with one book's exercises. Study the ideas found in one book through the act of drawing. Try to get a feel for how the artist is approaching things. This will help when going on to other fundamentals. One thing builds on top of the other. But be reasonable about the details, not everyone agrees on what the fundamentals are or what they look like.  When someone says ""Fundamentals"" they're usually referring to conventions relative to a certain approach. Essentially it's what binds those fundamentals together, it's what makes them so fundamental. That binding element is usually how things are seen, the approach of seeing things in a particular fashion. From there the fundamentals are shaped.   Combining two or more approaches can become confusing because they each treat what is fundamental differently. They may all come from observation, but what they do with that may differ greatly.  Edward's approach starts with seeing the expressive qualities of what is observed. While Loomis's approach starts with seeing the compositional qualities of what is observed. Starting out the two are opposed to one another. Edward's focuses on the virtues of line expressing the unique qualities of a subject's form. She'll urge you to not break things down into stereotypical graphic froms--e.g. symbols. While Loomis immediately jumps into composing with those stereotypical graphic forms--e.g. simple primitives. Loomis would have you simplify the whole subject first and then work out the details.  So something like contour would be treated differently by each Artist. Edwards sees contour as a delicate movement of expressing the ins and outs of the form. While Loomis would treat contour as a spatial divider enveloping the form. One looks at character while the other looks at structure.  So, depending on what you want to do with drawing, what you want say with drawing, it may be best to stick with one Artist for now. Going through and seeing how an artist binds their fundamentals together may help when looking at how other artists bind their fundamentals."

Or was it ""10.000""? i'll let you know when i get there ;) That and proko is great to keep you drawing in a productive and educational way.   perspective is covered in Loomis effectively. I've seen some great painters who just can't for the late of them place two cubes next to each other in a convincing matter. Study a bit of perspective. One point, two point and then three point. It's easy stuff. connect-the-dots for adults really..."
learnart,3cu4y4,jpegjockey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"Perspective - Simple box exercise Draw a horizon line, mark your vanishing point and draw different types of boxes. Remember to keep your boxes clean. No wobbly lines or curved lines. Nice and straight freehand.   Form and Contour - Organic contour exercise. Draw an organic blob. Use heavy line weight on the bulbous parts to indicate form and draw curved half ellipses to show 3D space.  Proportion and Value are gained slowly through various life studies. Start with simple shapes. Here are the values of a  circle. Eventually you want to memorize these basic ones so you can apply them to more complex shapes.  These are some really basic exercises, so make sure you're properly advancing into more intermediate exercises after familiarizing yourself with these."
learnart,3cu4y4,throawaya0101,-1,Fri Jul 10 21:16:56 2015 UTC,"The understanding comes with working and reading. Art is different from other disciplines (e.g. History: read, study, understand, take the test and move on). Art is more like: read, draw, fail, re-read, draw, fail, re-read, etc., etc. and then with diligence at some point you get an ""Aha"" moment and understand the concept."

learnart,3cresl,MetalPandaDance,2,Fri Jul 10 15:42:44 2015 UTC,"This is a bit of a vague question. If you were working digitally, it'd be done in a separate layer with initial work done while you're doing the lineart. This is for detailed backgrounds like cities or other settings. For a decorative afterthought kind of background, you can look at examples of comic artists who need something for a character presentation. It's important that it isnt distracting. Manga artists use scratch sheets for shapes and patterns. In all cases, it's easiest to do the background in Photoshop after cleaning up linework. My suggestion is to scan your drawing, and add a background in Photoshop. There are lots of things you can do like gradients or patterns. I think my favorite is when you take the general colors of the drawing and generate a color field background. You can also duplicate and blowup the drawing itself and add a gaussian blur which I've seen many people do. I can't find any examples though."

I'll start by answering your last question - I think that nowadays it's a real strength to be a (good) generalist and studios are actually looking more and more for that role. I think it's a good idea to know a bit of 3D modelling, texturing and a bit of compositing/lighting/painting. After a while, once you start working, you can always choose to specialize!   When making a portfolio try to be as varied as possible, while maintaining a consistent style. It's ok to make different sets for different styles, but don't show them all in one set as that will confuse your employer! That being said, you need to know what you want and tailor your portfolio for that role.   If you want to work as a character concept artist for games, research the latest game art coming from big companies and try to do something of similar quality/style.  If you want to work as a generalist do a short video showcasing your skills in the areas you are familiar with.  And so on..."

It really fascinated me and so I applied for my first job as a matte painter.   Both industries have amazing talent, what sets them apart is the role of the artist. Gaming industry feels to me more friendly and free - the art team , for the most part, is like a family and you get to do a lot of explorations, concepts and fun research. Quite opposite, the film (vfx) industry is very accurate/precise and more technical. There's almost no room for exploration and - for the most part - there's very little creative freedom for you, as an artist. However, this doesn't mean it's easy or boring - as the challenge of creating complex environments that match live action plates is fun in itself."

In the temple I think some detail up close would be nice;  we are missing that atmospheric perspective idea, everything for the most part has a similar level of detail.  Same is true of the bridge, also I think there is a angular perspective problem in the right most supports,the top half seems to shift a little straight on."
learnart,3cokig,Theartistcu,2,Thu Jul 9 15:06:55 2015 UTC,Agreed on the bridge. It took me a little while to wrap my head around which way it was supposed to be going. It looks as though the support in the middle is in the fore of the support on the right.
learnart,3cokig,humanehero,3,Thu Jul 9 17:48:54 2015 UTC,"I think it is an issue of the initial composition. It lacks depth/perspective, giving it a ""flat"" look.  The rendering looks great. You just needed a more dynamic angle in each case to really sell the depth. I think, in the future, this is where thumbnails might come in handy to fine tune the layout of the major elements. Also, try employing perspective grids to help plan out your depth from the start."
learnart,3cokig,searine,3,Thu Jul 9 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"For me, it's that the perspective/sizing is just a bit off in places. For example, in your temple, the sizing of the two frontmost trees on the left don't agree with each other. They look like the same size, but when you compare them to the tiny shrines around the same depth level (draw a horizontal line to them from the tree), you see that the second frontmost tree is much bigger in size compared to the frontmost tree and shrine (it doesn't help that the big root sticking out from both trees are exactly the same size visibly). It's entirely possible that the tree is just that much bigger than the front tree, but the disrepency kills the depth a bit.   In addition to that, if you were to really go for depth, you can push the size variation much more. Those front trees? make them almost twice as big. If you want, you can take this as an opportunity to overlap more of your environment objects. Right now, there isn't too much overlap, so you don't really see many objects relate to others as much as you could.  Tonal-wise, if you're really going for depth, you're not going to see things as dark/black from far away as you would when it's close up. The simplified rule of that is that you only use your darkest values for your foreground objects. The farther things are, the more they tend to middle values, with significantly less contrast due to atmospheric perspective. You're doing a good job with the leaves in the background for the temple, but do you see how you used the same exact value for the foreground trees and the trees 500 feet in the back? Lighten the ones in the back some, and see if it pushes them back more.  Hope that helps! You're doing a great job."

You can start to get picky when the difference become obvious to you."

From my experience, traditional art does lend itself teaching to controlling your wrist and arms without the interference of lag from a computer, plus being able to sketch on the go with paper and pencil helps to pay attention to your surroundings. Traditional art is also very good to help you learn the basics of art without having to soley rely on the tool itself to make it look good since you have more control over the tool you're using.  You don't even need any fancy tools to start. Unlike digital art, traditional art could be learned with something simple as a #2 pencil, eraser, and computer paper and you won't need a fancy program to learn the ins-and-out of."

It could work nicely for pixel art, but when it comes to drawing with any sort of gesture or energy, mice fall short. The way I look at it, a mouse is great for very precise actions, while tablets are stronger at more gestural motion. They're not precise at all, but they will be more effective when it comes to drawing sweeping curves.  Ultimately, if you want to draw, you can't really get around having to learn how to draw. That means the 'physical drawing part'. The theory will only get you so far as far as understanding goes - you quickly reach a point where memorizing the concepts won't mean much without actually being able to actually practice the craft.  I run the subreddit /r/ArtFundamentals, where I post structured, exercise-based lessons for those who are looking for a place to start. Seeing that you're a programmer, the analytical approach I use would likely appeal to you. The fine art methods of drawing never really worked for me (before switching careers, I was working as a game programmer), but the constructive exercises I share on /r/ArtFundamentals really clicked.  Ultimately, it is important in my opinion that you start off on paper - adding the extra layer of abstraction that digital provides will make it somewhat more challenging to absorb the concepts and understand those fundamental skills. It will also take some time, but it is a reachable goal for anyone with functioning hands, arms and eyes."
learnart,3cnzjt,Toldea,2,Thu Jul 9 14:34:17 2015 UTC,"Drawing with a mouse definitely is a pain. You lack the accuracy and the ability to use pressure sensitivity of a tablet. A tablet is definitely a good investment if you want to delve into digital art. That said, in my opinion it is better to learn the basic fundamentals traditionally first.  Digital adds an extra layer of disconnection between you and the paper. It also has an abundance of clutch tools which if used inappropriately can easily lead to developing bad habits. Because of those reasons I'd recommend you start out with pen and paper. Once you can draw to a reasonable satisfactory level traditionally you can make a more informed decision on whether to invest in a tablet or not."
learnart,3cnzjt,fanatical,2,Thu Jul 9 12:21:29 2015 UTC,"If you're a complete beginner you'll have just as much benefit from just getting a pencil and some paper. In some ways more, since physical materials will give you a tactile sensitivity with the tools and materials that will never change with a tablet.   Remember that you can always scan and work on it digitally later if you end up going digital eventually anyway."
learnart,3cnzjt,yardaper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:17:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely buy a tablet, a mouse is very difficult to use for art.  Monoprice has cheap decent tablets.  I learned to draw a year ago with a mixture of digital drawing and physical pencil and paper, and the skills translate fairly well.  Just don't learn with a mouse."
learnart,3cnzjt,cRaziMan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:49:55 2015 UTC,"PC tablets are really expensive. I've got an android tablet (Note 8....it's really cheap now and has a stylus and digitiser built in). It works really well for learning line drawing with an app called ArtFlow. Colouring is easy enough with a mouse, but that can be done on the tablet as well.   I'd recommend a Note 8."
learnart,3cnzjt,Uncomfortable,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:51:40 2015 UTC,"/u/yardaper was referring to graphics tablets, the most well known of which are made by Wacom - USB devices that you plug into your PC, that give you a surface on which you can use a pressure sensitive stylus. A tablet PC goes a step further to build that functionality into the screen itself, which is why those are more expensive. Standard wacom tablets and the alternatives (monoprice, huion, etc) are much less expensive. The one I use professionally was about $300USD. Probably still more expensive than your Note 8, but not being able to use industry standard software is somewhat limiting."
learnart,3cnzjt,cRaziMan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:13:12 2015 UTC,"I know what you were referring to, I've had a USB pc tablet/digitiser before as well.   I'm talking about an alternative that is much much cheaper than a pc tablet with a screen, much more intuitive and user friendly than a pc tablet without a screen and much more portable and multifunctional.   Especially if the needs are more basic (like mine) then I find it much easier to draw on the Android tablet (which has layers and pressure sensitivity and everything) and then importing it into GIMP if it needs to be manipulated on PC software."
learnart,3cnzjt,Kinuika,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:27:09 2015 UTC,"Practice with pencil and paper now and save up for a tablet. A lot of the basic skills such as understanding forms and getting gesture can be easily transferred between traditional and digital mediums. If you want a cheaper tablet look at some huion and monoprice tablets and try to buy the biggest model you can afford (a tablet is an investment, chances are it will last you for a good amount of years)"
learnart,3cnzjt,Atreides_Blade,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"I started with a Wacom Bamboo. While I could not make anything super precise with it, it was a less expensive means of getting into an art form and practicing enough to know whether or not I wanted to take the next step. I know some people can use a mouse for digital art, I am not one of them. I was not great using a tablet, but I now own a Cintiq wx12 and an Intuos 4 medium and using both allows me to create art competently enough for it to stay a life long hobby.  My opinion is, you are going to have to spend some hard earned cash, there are worse ways to spend it on than on art supplies... so long as you actually use them. Don't worry about the skill part, that takes time for everyone. Have fun!"

learnart,3ck65q,nbates80,2,Wed Jul 8 15:27:52 2015 UTC,These are your first drawing?!? Wow you have a lot of talent. The only thing that I can really recommend is to push your dark. A teacher told me once that there should be at least one thing in every piece that has at least a shade on it that is absolute black.
learnart,3ck65q,Everybody-thought-it,2,Wed Jul 8 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I'll try to make some parts darker. Maybe the shadow behind him, to the left of the drawing. I remember I tried making some things darker but for some reason I don't remember now I didn't achieve a black as dark as the tip of the owl's feathers."
learnart,3ck65q,throawaya0101,2,Wed Jul 8 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"Proportion & construction are on the right track. Value + line weight + texture need more work.   Plague Doctor   The doctor has really detailed clothing folds with super crisp textures The rodents give the image a sense of dynamic movement. Without them, the doctor feels static and 1 dimensional The highlight on the lamp is way too harsh. Lamps light a room circularly. The strongest highlight is in the middle and gradually moves outward losing value.   The owl   The line weight is really weak throughout. Some parts like the feather need light wisp like strokes. While the end of the wings are heavy and dominant. The talons also need to be bold and heavy. Just like the plague doctor, you're missing really key textures and details with the feathering   The highlight here is also really strong. Remember the owl's feather isn't all white but short strokes of white.    Also I really recommend beginners work in tan or dark grey sketchbooks because it makes student add more subtle value + addictive highlights (through a white colored pencil, white gel pen)"
learnart,3ck65q,cajolerisms,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed critique!  I'm watching the video and I'll definitely research on those topics. Fabrics is something I really struggle with and I think I'll focus on that on a later drawing.  About the line weight, you are right... I now see I didn't really thought about it and made some parts look too heavy (like the small hair-like feathers on the owl's back) and some parts to washed out (talons).  Once again, thank you for your time!"
learnart,3ck65q,Kinuika,2,Wed Jul 8 17:58:35 2015 UTC,"I think both of these are very strong for a relative beginner, so keep up the good work! The big thing I'm seeing is that you jumped into the ""fun"" stuff like shading, color, and texture before being entirely solid on the underlying drawing. A lot of proportions and angles on the plague doctor are nearly accurate compared to the photo, but not quite there. The body of the owl doesn't communicate much-- like I can clearly tell that it's an owl from the head, wing feather, and feet, but the body is reading as marks and shapes. For both, you're also approximating details and seem to have rushed through the more repetitive forms like fabric folds and feathers.   There is a fair amount of flexibility when it comes to natural forms like human poses, clothing, and animals so as long as it look mostly accurate, most people won't make the effort to look for those difference. It's up to you as the artist to develop the discipline needed to power through the tedious stuff like double and triple checking every part of the drawing and to maintain the same level of care and attention to every aspect of the work."
learnart,3ck65q,BlackRiderCo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:03:54 2015 UTC,You seem to be copying the images without really understanding the underlying forms. I suggest doing some drawings from life before you start picking up some bad habits :)

learnart,3chrg3,mbendhiab,3,Wed Jul 8 00:28:39 2015 UTC,"Lighting of an object as well as the type of material the light is hitting is pretty important for determining what the end result will look like. Since Blitz is made of metal his type of lighting would be seen as more reflective and the highlights are more noticeable and brighter than if he was made of stone for example (like malphite). For realistic lighting you also have to take into account that some of the light is coming from his ults lightning and in the splash you can see that the bolts on his hand are reflecting some blue light because of that. I'm not a total art expert so a good tutorial i have seen would be http://androidarts.com/art_tut.htm, as it goes further in depth than I do on lighting in as well as other stuff. Hope I helped."
learnart,3chrg3,Champ723,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:56:06 2015 UTC,Ty very much for your help friend! I have redone the shadows and lights along with some other changes and the drawing became much better: BlitzCrank V2  it would be nice if you could give me your thoughts on this picture and what i can improve on next =)
learnart,3chrg3,DaddyBishop,2,Wed Jul 8 22:45:49 2015 UTC,"Since you said your light spot was coming from the top right, the bottom left would logically be the darkest area. This also depends on where exactly the light is too. Is it more infront of Blitz, or behind him? You have to remember life is 3 dimensional, so top left only indicates 2 dimensions, figuring out if the light is infront of or behind Blitz is your 3rd dimension.  If the light is infront of him, his right leg would be mostly out of the light, due to the mass of his body (kind of like how the splash art is), yet you coloured the leg with the same brightness as the rest of him.  Don't forget about the shadows cast from other object. Like how I mentioned the right leg should be darker, it is because his body is casting a shadow over his leg. When the light hits other parts of his body, they also cast shadows. His head should cast a shadow like in the splash art. In the splash art it is from the blue electricity on Blitz's right hand and the shadow is cast on the left side of his neck. Also, look at the spikes. They too cast a shadow onto his neck area. See the two shadows? This is caused from the unknown light source coming from the top right of the splash art.  All in all you have a pretty decent idea of how to start your shading. I would continue to study the splash art and utilize similar shading techniques. For practice at home, to get an idea of shading, you can use a desk lamp and aim it at different objects with different surfaces (like a shiny apple or a dull cardboard box) and try using the light at different angles round the objects. This will help you get an idea of shadows being cast by the object and how the lamp lights up the objects. You can also try grouping objects together to get an idea of how they cast shadows on each other."

learnart,3cgfht,canlickherelbow,2,Thu Jul 9 03:33:50 2015 UTC,"You can't do comic/manga style properly without life drawing, it will just look like a 13 year old made them. You must understand what you're drawing before you try to do any kind of stylisation, otherwise it will fall apart. It doesn't matter if you only do it for recreation, you'll still get frustrated if it's bad.   I really need to prioritize what little time I have outside my fulltime job   Ok, I understand that, but you really don't have to do everything at once, like take a fuckton of courses and try to fit them all in your schedule. Take a basic one, finish it, move on to a comic art or character design course and so on. I'd take weekly life drawing courses all along the way so I don't get rusty. Believe me, after the life drawing courses it's 80% faster and easier to draw from imagination, so why struggle to do it without them?  Where do you live, anyway? If there are part-time courses like that in my shithole of a country, there should be some options where you live too. Google them."
learnart,3cgfht,throawaya0101,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:00:53 2015 UTC,"Short answer is you're out of luck. The classes you're looking for are going to need a portfolio presentation or at least basic understanding of fundamentals. Comic design is essentially simplified real life design, so without good foundation then it's going to look horrible.   Here's a class brochure from my art school if you want some direction. Look for classes that have entertainment design, concept design, story boarding, etc.  Honestly, I would just take a writing course/basic story prompt class and just dive into making your first comic. Most comics don't really need a strong art background if you have a really strong writing background."

It might help to recognize what type of learner you are.  There are plenty of people who can pick up a lot via YouTube videos but for me, I need the hands-on, in person setting, so I can ask questions, receive immediate feedback, and have someone make suggestions for where to go next in my practice and study.  I highly encourage taking classes, but that's because I had a good experience with mine."
learnart,3cdv28,calaveracatrina,2,Tue Jul 7 04:34:46 2015 UTC,"I don't do visual art, just following the sub since I'm thinking about getting into it, but I wanted to say I think lessons and having someone to get feedback from are immensely helpful when you're getting started. I think YouTube videos and online resources are great once you can hold your own, but half the battle when you're getting started with a new skill is learning what you need to learn. I taught myself guitar, and it took a long time to become proficient. When I started drums I immediately got lessons and it was wild how quickly I progressed because I had someone to show me what's important as a beginner and gave feedback on what I was doing well and what I need to focus on. I could ask a question and get a good answer right away, and they could tell me about related things I might be interested in, versus searching online for an hour. It's also difficult to discern good and bad advice and what's even worth your time as a beginner."
learnart,3cdv28,SpaceCadetJones,4,Tue Jul 7 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with u/perrocontodo, it's totally worth it. Firstly, being in a class of fellow beginners will show you that your skills aren't as bad as you might think. The problem with online resources is that you might find yourself comparing your work to people with years and years of experience which can become very discouraging. Seeing other peoples work with your same level of experience will help you and the others see your own development.  Also, a good instructor with experience can quickly spot bad habits before they form, and also guide your drawing which will help you develop faster. I personally learned more in one semester of life drawing with a teacher than I did in two years of open life studios.  Lastly, attending a class will force you through the tedious exercises you might otherwise skip. The dreaded ""draw and shade a cube/sphere/cone"" task is one I personally hate, but truly has merit for a beginner.  Tldr; Go. Its worth every penny even if you just do one class."

Maybe there is a club or art group in your area that will let you join them, they tend to have a mix of both beginners and more experienced artists in them. You can learn a lot from the people there and it is a good chance to see if you like art enough before you commit to a full time course in the subject.  Do not be scared to try a mix of resources as in the long run finding out what works for you is what matters most"
learnart,3cdv28,perrocontodo,4,Tue Jul 7 07:36:42 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. The free resources are there, but they won't teach you what to see, what to avoid in terms of how you even hold the pencil, a good teacher will tackle those issues right on the spot.  When I was in the university, I was a class assistant, which in real life meant that the real teacher will just leave the classroom, me taking entire responsability of the students, which I shared some other classes with. Some of them were plain lazy or weren't interested in drawing, probably more typography of web design, whatever.  And I learnt, just seeing they ""mistakes"" and without trying to plain fix them, understanding them and guiding them through their own personal development. I learnt more than that when I was part of the class.  Sorry for the rambling. I agree in part with you, there are plenty of resources, free and paid, online, to get better, and I use them 50/50, www.posespace.com, www.posemaniacs.com, www.quickposes.com just for starters, but there are plenty of reasons to go, to learn from your peers, to try a different tool, to force yourself to do stuff you think you won't like. The social experience is the least of it, there might be a nice bunch, but drawing is ultimately a personal, intimate, lonely experience, and if any, being too much into socializing -there- will detract from your own development.  Another danger, just using references from the screen, will DEFINITELY fuck with your skills, again, I'm talking from my personal experience and some respected artists, which I know personally some, see, the brain works different when copying than when creating, and even more differently when copying just from photos. Even guys like Norman Rockwell, who used well-produced photoshoots to use as reference, started with life drawing, academia, the basics, then when he saw a photo, he knew exactly was was happening in terms of volumes and weights, so he could change it at will to fit his idea, which always came before the photoshoot.  At the end, you're right, depends of what OP wants to learn. But even if he decides he doesn't really want to be an artist or an illustrator, taking a class will prepare him/her way better to understand and apply the online resources with a sceptic eye and not so seriously.   Cheers and sorry for the rant. Check my rather poor submission history and you can see I love drawing."

learnart,3ccd7z,ProductofUnreality,8,Mon Jul 6 21:50:46 2015 UTC,"Building two accounts will be beneficial. Your pricing will be different for each style, and it won't confuse the buyers if the art comes from two different personas. Also, the branding and marketing will need different strategies as the audiences will be different, what will work for getting people to follow your photography, might not work for the illustrations and vice versa. You can use something like Hootsuite to manage your different social media accounts.  In the end, you'll have to try different approaches and find what works for you. If you want to be known for doing two very different things, then you can find a way to play that as your strength."
learnart,3ccd7z,d2artist,2,Mon Jul 6 22:26:51 2015 UTC,Also important is that if OP (or anyone else reading) is ever looking for gallery representation galleries always want to know exactly what they can expect from an artist.

learnart,3cd9iq,GlyphInBullet,3,Tue Jul 7 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite actually. In my opinion it is easier to develop bad habits if you learn your fundamentals digital instead of traditional.   The extra disconnection between your hand and the digital paper combined with the many clutches digital software offer make it quite easy to develop a lot of bad habits. For instance relying too much on infinite undo's and the transform and warp tool to get your lines right, instead of actually spending the time improving your line quality.  My recommendation would be to stick to traditional and specifically do a lot of your work in a very unforgiving medium like for instance a felt tipped pen. Having to commit to your lines forces you to plan ahead or live with your mistakes. Any issues you have will be presented very clearly to you which makes them easier to spot and fix early on.  Once you have that traditional foundation it won't really be that hard to transition to digital. It'll take a little bit to get used to drawing on a tablet or cintiq plus you'll need to learn about all the digital tricks. However your foundation will carry over almost flawlessly, which is a lot more important than any medium specific thing."
learnart,3cd9iq,Toldea,2,Tue Jul 7 11:58:51 2015 UTC,"Drawing ability will transition regardless of medium. It's all about the mileage. Do as much traditional media as you can, especially painting. Strictly digital artists usually have no good understanding of the way color works."

learnart,3c7np9,Chrisbscotland,5,Sun Jul 5 17:39:02 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on how you're going about drawing. What's your process like?  I think a good way of working is to work BIG to small. When studying animals(in your case lizards and birds because they are the main inspiration for the people who created dragons), you want to start with the big overall shapes and work your way down to smaller and smaller shapes and details. This goes for studying anything, actually.  Look at the picture of a dragon done by Mike Azevedo.  And here's a simple draw over of his work to kind of show what I mean  Try to find the big overall shapes of the dragon. The head, body, wings, and tail are all made up of simple shapes (Red). Then go into more detailed shapes like adding traingles for the mouth, some horns, and the wing segments, cylinders and spherical shapes for the body, limbs, and tail (yellow).  Slowly build up the creature. Try not to focus on details until the end.  Also, its very normal to feel frustrated. Every artist does. Even the best. The thing is, you have to push through it if you really want to get better."
learnart,3c7np9,theburritoman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:20:21 2015 UTC,I do try get overall shape but think I may be rushing it as well. trying put too much finer details down first. Hard to visual 3d objects at the moment. But thank you for the comment and those links they were helpful.

learnart,3c7np9,cajolerisms,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"That is the thing with creative work, sometimes things just work in this moment.  That's one reason why i often work on several drawing/paintings/sketches. If one thing just doesn't tick i lock into one of the other things to do. Sometimes you might have to lay the pen aside for a full day.  Also: A few months might not be a long time for practicing drawing, depending on the amount you are actually practising. Don't await too much and don't await it imidiately.  Sometrimes the process of learning kinda clocks up your creative drain, you get stuck. Keep at it, with a bit of work you migth get trough and have an eureka moment.  One of the most important things (for me) to fight frustration is to safe/keep safe, label and date my drawings. Even when working digitally i always put a copy of the recently finished drawing, withe the date in the  name in a folder named ""finished"". No matter if digital or physical/traditional it helps to look at all of your finished works once in a while to actually see te progress you have made. You might surprise yourself how far you have gotten."
learnart,3c7np9,cajolerisms,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:32:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just lack of experience is frustrating as I have idea but its how I want to show it makes it difficult cause I dont know what techniques I can use to convey the idea.   I might reduce to drawing to 30-40min time period and take 15min breaks."

learnart,3c5se2,ThoseRntMyKidz,3,Sun Jul 5 06:00:42 2015 UTC,"pixelovely.com is great for practicing and getting a feel for the human body.   Also I like to use DAZ Studio, which is a free (well, at least the basic content is free) posing program and great if you want to set up & study a certain pose from different angles. Basically it substitutes life models for most cases."
learnart,3c5se2,ThereGoesMyUsername,3,Sun Jul 5 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"The cliche wooden mannequins are honestly my go to. All it takes is some imagination and you have the exact pose you need right in front of you. The beauty of them, in my opinion, is that the wooden mannequins outline basic body composition and muscle structure/location. With this its easy to turn the basic position into anything from a cartoon style drawing to a realism painting. The possibilities are endless. Although it might take some work to get accustomed to; it is the most useful tool I have on my drafting desk."
learnart,3c5se2,Fearrless,2,Sun Jul 5 05:00:28 2015 UTC,"When learning, photo reference comes in handy, but it cannot replace the benefits of drawing from life. Life drawing can be a challenge at first, but with enough practice you will learn the human form, the proportions, and you'll be able to create dynamic and accurate poses with or without reference."

learnart,3c66zp,Uncle_Skeeter,2,Sun Jul 5 05:19:18 2015 UTC,"Nope. That is really not going to happen for that small amount of money. At least not a new device.  Go to eBay and search for Asus ep121, Samsung Note 10.1. Stuff like that. $300 isn't a lot of money for a computer that has pen pressure technology built into the screen. The stuff you will find will probably be several years behind in terms of tech power, FYI."
learnart,3c66zp,theburritoman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:50:25 2015 UTC,"I figured as much. I pretty much knew the answer when I asked the question as I did research before I asked, as always.  I did find the Asus Transformer book with the detachable keyboard and it could be had for $200. Might go that way if I know I can use a stylus with it."
learnart,3c66zp,theburritoman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:15:10 2015 UTC,"Just know that there's a difference between normal touch screen tech and the wacom (and other companies') tech that's used in the Cintiqs and Surface Pros of the world.  The Asus Transformer looks like it only has capacitive touch meaning that it can only register a click. There is no variation of pressure. You can buy a stylus from the store but those aren't pressure sensitive so they'll be like using a mouse in the form of a pen.  The Asus ep121 is a Windows computer that has a wacom pen digitizer. I own one of these and it is a fairly capable machine. You won't be able to work on files that are too big or with exceedingly large brushes, but for sketching, it works well."
learnart,3c66zp,throawaya0101,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:09:10 2015 UTC,"You're not going to find any tablets with direct to draw like the cintiqs at your price point. There are, however, really decent graphic tablets you connect to a desktop/laptop but you have to look at monitor while you draw.   Monoprice Great drawing space and affordable price. Also good sensitivity. Wacom A nice standard tablet from a dependable company. It's a little more expensive than the monoprice but it comes with the brand name   If you're willing to go outside your price point then you have two options. Tablets (ipad, surface pro,etc) and Tablet Monitors (cintiq,yiynova)."
learnart,3c66zp,sleepycapybara,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:58:56 2015 UTC,"thinkpad X220 is your best option, though a bit bulky. Or just save up for a surface 3."
learnart,3c66zp,SamadeusLux,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:20:13 2015 UTC,"You can get a Fujitsu Lifebook t900 or t901 for about that price on ebay. I have one, and it works fine for the most part (A couple things don't work in Windows 8). They are kind of thick and heavy, but for your price range it's all I know of. But Honestly for drawing, pencil and paper is a much better experience.  With tablet PCs the cursor almost never lines up perfectly with where the pen is, and it's bothersome. You can ignore it, but it still grates on you and after a while if you go draw with pencil and paper, it feels like such a relief to have that perfect tactile interaction and subtle manipulation that you can't get with current tablet technology.  That said, I do a lot of digital painting, but mostly on my regular (very) old wacom tablet. When you're painting, you tend to use bigger brushes, and the exact precision isn't as important. And the lack thereof isn't as noticable.  I recommend asking yourself if it's worth it to you to get an imperfect jack of all trades tool for 2 or 3 hundred dollars (Or perhaps 100 dollars or so on a regular drawing tablet?), or spend 10 dollars an pencils and a sketchbook and focus on drawing."
