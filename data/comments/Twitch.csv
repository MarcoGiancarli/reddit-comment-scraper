Twitch,3e0eqs,distortednet,9,Tue Jul 21 00:25:48 2015 UTC,"Sure. On the Twinge site, a third-party data collection platform, myself and later my editor helpers were given an editing toolbar that allowed us to go through and tag pre-appropriated channels in the system. We started with the top 2500 and then did a random section of 2500. Our data was limited to about 110k streamers overall, since Twinge restricts down to those who have had 15 concurrent viewers or more.   Hope that helps. I'm willing to share more raw data with you privately."

Twitch,3e0eqs,goatyherd,4,Tue Jul 21 02:12:17 2015 UTC,"How was gender established; simply from looking/listening to the streamer, or by asking them personally? Was this based on presumptive gender identity, or the streamer's self-identification?   I ask because I've known some streamers to be trans or non-binary; sometimes they get crap for that, sometimes they get crap because of people's presumption of their gender. I've also seen some streamers with very ambiguous features and voices, so I'm curious what standard the data collectors were going by."
Twitch,3e0eqs,jkkennedy,8,Tue Jul 21 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"That's a good question.   We used a combination of methods. Sometimes it's very obvious, and sometimes we combed through social media, profile descriptions, VODs, etc. If they identified as a different gender than they appeared, we marked it as what they identified with. If they identified with neither, we were planning on marking those in ""other"" rather than creating new categories, but don't think we've run across that example yet.  When in doubt, we'd share the channel with the rest of the team until someone figured it out with sleuthing. We tried to be very careful, because we knew this was important."
Twitch,3e0eqs,jkkennedy,2,Tue Jul 21 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"I ran into one caster who in their info section said they identify as girl or boy, so they were marked ""other"" the most common channels that I found to put into ""other"" were channels that had no information, no vods, & no other social media to be found."
Twitch,3e0eqs,joan_hickson,5,Tue Jul 21 14:38:10 2015 UTC,"Awesome to have something like this study occurring. Looking forward to the full report when it comes out and interested in possibly reading up on analysis for ""why"" certain results are what they are both from the data viewpoint and from personal streamers viewpoints.  For example, I can only guess on why women stream fewer hours average, but I would assume that streaming takes a larger mental toll on women streamers due to the toxicity in chat at times."
Twitch,3e0eqs,jkkennedy,4,Tue Jul 21 12:31:55 2015 UTC,"That's very possible, and it's one of the theories. We have developed our own theories to answer the ""WHY"", but our next steps will to be distributing a survey that gets some info directly from male and female streamers.

HOWEVER, your point about toxicity is 100% true."
Twitch,3e0eqs,defeatedbird,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:20 2015 UTC,Oh I can definitely see that as well. I wonder if their is a age difference and family situation difference between the average top male streamer and the average top female streamer.

Twitch,3e0eqs,G33kGrrly,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:17 2015 UTC,"You should do the same study and throw out the top 200 and bottom 200 of the pool of 2500. It'd give you a lot better representation of the current growth of each gender.  I've been using streaming platforms since jtv and owned, I'm mostly a lurker and always have been, and I must say that it's a bit ignorant for anyone to think it's not exploding in the direction of females currently.  I think things you should not include in this are any eSports related channels(as in, ESL, Dreamhack, any LoL tournament, etc etc) and also you should toss channels like Sodapoppin, Forsen, KittyPlaysGames, etc. These few channels will so dramatically destroy any average that there's no reason they should be included if you're doing a study based on average gains for the typical twitch streamer.  Out of curiosity, do you honestly think your results are accurate? If a male were to create a channel today he would most likely finish a 6 hour day with one or two viewers. If a female did this she would finish most likely in the 10-15 range. Assuming equal attractiveness and skill level in the game they're playing.  If you really want to dive deep into this you should be doing viewers based on the number of users currently logged into the IRC room for each streamer, as the number of bots(or unauthenticated viewers) is far higher in the larger the streams go. (I'm not saying everyone bots, I'm saying the larger the number of viewers the more likely there are bots being used by someone(duh?).  I think this would give very surprising results to most people who seem to have no clue how the twitch viewership model currently works. Unfortunately I don't know anything about data collection, but I'd love to see the number of authorized(logged in) viewers compared to the unauthorized for different streamers, viewer counts, etc."
Twitch,3e0eqs,Ketku_RiGhT,4,Tue Jul 21 12:11:28 2015 UTC,"minus the top 200 would be interesting as far as average goes. The ""random"" data is only from casters who receive over 15 viewers. There were two data gatherings, one was 2500 of the top & the other was 2500 random to be able to compare. The esport channels like ESL, DreamHack, etc are in the category ""Company"""

Twitch,3e0eqs,joan_hickson,2,Wed Jul 22 01:32:36 2015 UTC,"Love what you guys are doing.   There are a LOT of other myth's on Twitch as well, such as:    Using a webcam will help stream growth streaming at a bitrate over 2mbps will hurt stream growth Having a follow/sub notification will increase follows/subs And many, many more.    Any chance you guys could take a look at some of these? It would be great to know if you are actually hindering yourself not using a webcam. How about 60fps? Does having a 60fps stream mean more growth, vs a 30fps stream?"
Twitch,3e0eqs,DoPlusSee,2,Tue Jul 21 09:10:38 2015 UTC,"The bitrate one is tricky because a lot of it is dependent on where you are in relation to your viewer base. I'm in Boston but the vast majority of my viewers are in Europe because of the hours I stream, so pushing my bitrate up too high tends to have a more dramatic negative impact on them than my US viewers, even with transcoding. So in short, that one would be VERY complicated to address (but still very interesting!)."
Twitch,3e0eqs,DailyProblem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:48 2015 UTC,"I stream at about 2,500 bitrate out of Boston area too, and I can agree with you about anything higher. Though usually if they have an issue watching our stream, it's fleeting."
Twitch,3e0eqs,Dariath,2,Tue Jul 21 21:19:49 2015 UTC,Good ideas. I'm passing some of this on to the team.   The one that's the most interesting to me is webcam off/on. My general understanding right now is that a webcam is important for a new streamer (to get initial clicks) but not as important if you've never used one and are an established streamer. But I might be proved wrong there.
Twitch,3e0eqs,SuperTerrz,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about that too, it may say a lot about how much gender matters if the ratio of webcam / no webcam growth is higher for one than the other."
Twitch,3e0eqs,shiny_dunsparce,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:06:15 2015 UTC,"A few Ideas came to my mind after reading. I will just write them down because I'm lazy:  -You have to show data more relative to a fixed amount. The reader shouldn't have to realize that Men stream more from a diagram, it should be clear from the beginning.  -On the same note: Make groups of 100 or something. It would be interesting to only see the Top 100 and how it distributes in lower groups. (Like Percentiles or something.)  -You could probably get the subs through IRC. After One Month you could also get the sub amount in theory.  -> You should also get the topics of the stream through the API or something. The usage of things like ""raffle"" or ""subs"" would be interesting. If someone uses ""sub"" in his/her topic it is likely that they have a subgoal or make something for subs only  That's it for now. I will probably add something."
Twitch,3e0eqs,lulusoccer,2,Tue Jul 21 09:11:40 2015 UTC,"that's a good point about the stream titles, i wonder how many women as opposed to men advertise raffles, giveaways, etc..."
Twitch,3e0eqs,witoldc,6,Tue Jul 21 19:30:36 2015 UTC,From what I read I didn't see anything on how females get a better advantage when starting to stream. I.E. them gaining viewers faster and earlier on. (as i've witnessed around 4-5 girl streamers on their first stream get more views than me in 3 years)
Twitch,3e0eqs,motigist,3,Tue Jul 21 13:01:30 2015 UTC,"Give me some parameters and we might could study that. You mention within three years, but what would you say is ""starting to stream""?  Keep in mind that I do have one limitation that our entire dataset is limited to those channels who have had 15 concurrent viewers, which limits the number of channels I can run stats on down to about 110k channels, a small fraction of the channels who stream overall, but Twinge decided that was the cutoff."
Twitch,3e0eqs,CommentShaming,3,Tue Jul 21 19:11:12 2015 UTC,Maybe I see this differently. But from what I have noticed. Female streamers seem to get to about ~2500 followers before they stop growing so fast.
Twitch,3e0eqs,heresiarch,6,Tue Jul 21 18:42:55 2015 UTC,I'm actually curious about donation amounts and frequency for female streamers versus male. Any data on the topic?
Twitch,3e0eqs,ItzWarty,10,Tue Jul 21 21:20:55 2015 UTC,"I really, really wish we had access to that data. Unfortunately, these alert services don't collect gender data or have any way to access these kinds of logs. We could ASK streamers how much donations they get, but why would they want to tell that to strangers?"
Twitch,3e0eqs,CommentShaming,2,Wed Jul 22 00:15:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, lets be honest, if women had to get by on their personality or their gaming talent, pretty much 98% of female streamers would get no viewers.  I understand this may sound harsh but this is 100% true.    However I don't see anything wrong with it because lets be honest, people ultimately can do whatever they like with their time and their money, and if they want to spend time viewing and giving money to someone on the internet who will never even acknowledge their existence than that's their choice."
Twitch,3e0eqs,Brawli55,6,Wed Jul 22 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"I'd like to know if any of the female streamers that made the 15 viewer cut-off weren't using webcams, or even the top-2500 women, my bets on no."
Twitch,3e0eqs,Brawli55,2,Wed Jul 22 00:53:44 2015 UTC,"The mindset thought that girls can't play games is pretty ridiculous. I've been a female gamer since I was a child and while I'm not a top major league gamer I can hold my own in most games. I'm primarily a destiny streamer - I have max grimoire and platinumed the game and have well above average PVP games/scores. I also dress very modest on my twitch account. I stream to share my passion with the games I play and I do value skill In a video game, I'm a very competitive person."
Twitch,3e0eqs,Tenmar,3,Wed Jul 22 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"Interesting data points.  I'm not sure they lead to the statements made.    If most of the channels are dominated by men, men will dominate most of these stats.    It would be interesting to see how much in donations similar channels get, men vs women.  You can segment by follower count and average viewership and see which gender gets more money and grows faster.  I am not familiar with what data you have access too, and I realize this might be tough to obtain."
Twitch,3e0eqs,icechalk,4,Tue Jul 21 04:22:13 2015 UTC,"same impression here.  I got a strong feeling that since Twitch has a strong long-tail structure, and most people on the top of the curve are men, that will be reflected much more in top-2500 analysis (especially whenever averages are concerned).  In general, whenever you use averages, make note that biggest channels will have disproportionately high weight in those metrics"
Twitch,3e0eqs,Tchaikovsky1812,6,Tue Jul 21 06:13:58 2015 UTC,"We would really, really, really like some access to donation amounts and rates for the study. We just don't have any way to get to that data. I do think it'd enhance this study."
Twitch,3e0eqs,GL1513,-2,Tue Jul 21 04:41:05 2015 UTC,"I think the title ""Is it easier to be a woman on Twitch"" is a bit misleading. That doesn't take into account things like harassment, average donation size, donations per hour, people who follow but don't return.... I could probably think of more. Sure, there are a lot of men on Twitch, but...   ""Women get almost double the pageviews and triple the follows (for their size and hourly ratio) versus the average male streamer""   ... seems contradictory to the notion being presented. Most of the other points don't seem like myths to me, it's pretty obvious when you look at the channel list that there are a lot of men with high page view counts/followers.  The big takeaway for me was the way the percentage of women streamers tapers off from 19% to 9% as part of the top."
Twitch,3e0eqs,pascalbrax,3,Tue Jul 21 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"They're focusing on the actual output metric that matters - concurrent viewers.

Something like Just Dance or Dance Central isn't what I would call something marketed to men, but if a woman is streaming it, you get the idea of what the viewer base would be.  I appreciate the work and look forward to more of it. Thanks! Very insightful."
Twitch,3e0eqs,spla08,6,Tue Jul 21 02:03:04 2015 UTC,"I don't believe /u/spla08 counted by hand - she used http://socialblade.com/, and their data of the literal 100 top streams and had a looksie on which were female and found that only 8 were female. If you consider that to be ""counting by hand"" fair enough, but it's not like she came to her conclusions with unjustified information."
Twitch,3e0eqs,pascalbrax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:22:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, basically what I meant. Channel-by-channel analysis and recording. Same process we used for the 5500 tags we've completed so far."
Twitch,3e0eqs,spla08,2,Tue Jul 21 04:02:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, all you have to do is look at the top streams at any time of the day - rare are the female streams. It's nice you got actual data to perhaps prove this, but anyone without an axe to grind could tell you female streamers don't make the majority of streamers and don't really appear to receive any special boost because of their gender.   /u/neodestiny made a post here almost a year ago basically saying the same thing, that other than initial page views female streamers don't see any improved growth over male streamers"
Twitch,3e0eqs,pascalbrax,0,Tue Jul 21 04:38:15 2015 UTC,"I didn't believe them the moment they said ""counted by hand"". Any person who claims to actually be doing quantitative research would of just used Excel.  Also, their study is screwed up and creates a false narrative. Just like all the other crap narratives that have affected hobbyists who play games by dividing people by gender. Which is ultimately pointless and missing the point of entertainment and consumer demands."
Twitch,3e0eqs,Brawli55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"A decent start. I'd say there's more to the discussion of women streaming on twitch and your listed study purpose than the infographic lays out.  ""Is it easier for a woman to be on twitch?""  Yes and no. With what I figure to be the majority of twitch's audience, women have both unique opportunities to exploit(intentionally or not) that demographic for channel growth, as well as unwanted attention from people who for a list of reasons will want to say less than nice things.  I'm not convinced there's a need to prove that, yes, some viewers come by to say something abusive at a higher rate in female streamer channels. Just surf some popular mmo/league/popular release streams and you'll see some deleted comments. You insist that ""a lot of people don't realize"", but I'd wager anyone who doesn't see the problem isn't paying attention or is being dishonest. Is it worth spending energy providing evidence for those people, or are you merely pissing in the wind in that regard? Something to consider.  On another note, I'm surprised at the gap between genders in streamers above 15 viewers and to a lesser degree at the top 500. I assumed the split would exist, but be closer. My perception must be badly skewed by the games I tend to browse channels for and the streams I follow."
Twitch,3e0eqs,KCIV,0,Tue Jul 21 07:56:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with your post as a whole, but I think you're over-simplifying the usefulness of data on abusive speech. How big of a problem trolls in female channels isn't readily apparent to many viewers. There's value in gathering that data. You aren't going to convince people to ""your side"" if they choose to ignore the problem, but you can open people's eyes to just how widespread it is.   Looking at yourself, you knew a split existed, but didn't realize how large the gap was. Knowing the extent of these issues won't solve them on its own, but getting data on problems female streamers face is a good launching point to start from to fix them."
Twitch,3e0eqs,Brawli55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:44:18 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people are even making this assumption that women are taking over Twitch. Maybe it is much nicer, aesthetically, to see a gorgeous woman streaming (not flaunting), so what? That should be a GOOD thing. Maybe there are some women out there flaunting their breasts for attention, but there are as many guys (in my experience) who use their bodies by wearing sleeveless t's to get attention from their muscles. I think it would be perfectly fine to have just as many women as men streaming, some of them can kick *** in their respective games."
Twitch,3e0eqs,KCIV,3,Tue Jul 21 02:06:06 2015 UTC,"And even if the statement ""women are taking over Twitch"", I would be perfectly fine with that. More female gamers = more gamers = more streams = more choice."
Twitch,3e0eqs,lowdon,7,Tue Jul 21 10:05:13 2015 UTC,"well, first off I think there are more men than women on twitch, men showing off their muscles doesn't pull in the same as a woman in with boob cam. (unless you are pasha)  So I don't think those 2 comparisons are equal. but that might be a whole other issue completely.   But the issue of ""exploiting"" your fans is something that was brought up in a video series seeing the like of TB, Sky, Kacytron, YellingHD (SivHD) and others. here is a quick link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta8Dt24G8XU  its important to be very careful in these topics. My personal opinion on Kacytron should have no bearing on other female streamers such as Dodger or MargaretKrohn (and they don't). But I think when we start to say Woman should have boob cams or should not have boob cams, it is a very complicated and messy road. It's not a simple one and done conversation. Specially when trying to discuss intent.  I will also so. Bikini streams are supposed to not be allowed and so are ""shirtless"" streams (they are not equal but such is the TOS). so at least in that regard the rules are the same. the ""enforcement"" of that is pretty all over the place.  I also feel like there is a fear of disliking someone as well. Saying ""I don't like X streamer for Y reason"" is almost forbidden in many contexts. People have a hard time separating Rights/Opinions/and TOS."
Twitch,3e0eqs,ItzWarty,7,Tue Jul 21 04:44:17 2015 UTC,"here's the thing. i have nothing against boobcam streamers. they have a reason for what they're doing. whether they're trolling,  trying to gain views, or simply want their bodies to be appreciated, i have no problem with them, or their streams.   my problem is when their viewers, having been given approval of disgusting chat behaviour, toddle into MY stream and start making creepy compliments or asking me to show more skin. my viewers are my buddies, some of them are other streamers. we call each other dude. it throws a wrench in the works when someone who walks in and seems cool starts telling me how pretty my eyes are.   i feel like it just encourages a negative baser instinct that a lot of us are already fighting tooth and nail to counteract."

Twitch,3e0eqs,pascalbrax,3,Tue Jul 21 13:47:37 2015 UTC,You're right - it is arbitrary to demonize women who don't hide their sexuality when there are multitudes of all kinds of streamers using all kinds of abilities and features they are uniquely in control to get a leg up in attracting viewers.
Twitch,3e0eqs,kittakee,5,Tue Jul 21 14:19:02 2015 UTC,"""hide my sexuality"" and ""displaying for views"" are not the same thing. a ""bikini"" stream vs a ""normal T shirt"" stream are not necessarily comparable. Wear a bikini to the beach and its normal walk around the mall in one and its not exactly average. The context of streaming on twitch is very important. Its super complicated and I may have some misconceptions in this area so I am open to hearing everything :)  Need to be very very careful on these topics to not make generalizations on these things. Twitch does not say ""hide your body now"" but it does say ""streaming without a shirt is not allowed (male or female)"".  Are mens chests more enticing than barely covered breasts? considering the Twitch user base probably not, however Twitch does make a TOS that removes both of those cases.  You do make extremely accurate points about using abilities and features to attract viewers. its all ""exploitation"" People watch people because many reasons. To assign some of them as bad or good randomly gets really complicated. Specifically when you are trying to identify goal or intent.   Girl playing video games while sucking on the controller in a bikini pouring oil on her body isn't the same as Dodger having a morning talk show stream. This is an extreme example but I think there is a context that is often left out. HOWEVER I also think they both have a right to do both of those things. I just think Twitch also has the right to say what they want on their site. And while I may not agree with Twitch, it is after their site. so that also provides context as well."
Twitch,3e0eqs,pascalbrax,5,Tue Jul 21 03:26:20 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right - there is a stark difference between using your assets and not hiding your assets. My generalization came from a place of having to read posts on this subreddit, ones like in the recent ""your stream turn offs"" thread where a number of people said cleavage for them was an instant turn off when entering a stream.  Unbeknownst to these people there are women who have ample cleavage and really don't care if viewers are there to ogle them or not, though they'll get lumped in with ""those kinds of streams"" all the same, despite as I said in my original post, deriding these streams is utterly arbitrary and asinine."

Twitch,3e0eqs,kittakee,0,Tue Jul 21 05:25:29 2015 UTC,"This data is in no way conclusive. You cannot claim whether women are/aren't taking over twitch, the top of twitch, getting more or less viewers, or growing faster/slower than men. This inability to prove comes from a lack of disaggregation and numerous confounding factors which likely overwhelmingly skew your data set.  Take esports, where streaming truly took off. Esports is dominated (exclusively in LoL, at least) by males. Many viewers wish to and do watch professional players. As all (or the overwhelming majority) of those professional players are male, then the overwhelming majority of viewers watching professional players are watching male professional players. Due to this, there is a much lower concurrent viewership for females compared to males - that's why this data needs to be disaggregated by the professional state of players.  For this reason, it isn't correct to state whether men or women are growing faster on twitch, as the data does not disaggregate by the professional state of players. Clearly, individuals high on the viewer list will get more new viewers (why would I watch someone with 5 viewers playing Master Yi if Cowsep's online?), and from there, more followers - there might even be an exponential factor between viewer count and follower rate, due to the location of a stream on the listings, activity of chat, social network promotions, etc. The surveyed channels are simply not representative of the average twitch player because the surveyed channels include esports channels.   Furthermore, even if we removed the esports professional channels we wouldn't get any meaningful conclusions (I want causations); we need to look at the distribution of males vs females in games - I can guarantee you that the number of female individuals playing LoL/CSGO/DOTA does not come CLOSE to the number of males playing those games - this influences both the streamer-base of that gender AND the viewer-base of that gender (and yes, I realize there aren't 1000 LoLs). Not to mention that we don't have data showing whether females might prefer to watch females while males might prefer to watch males. We also don't have data on how social networks come into play - do average-joe females share their channels on facebook like men do, for example?"
Twitch,3e0eqs,kittakee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"This data is in no way conclusive.    I can agree with that. These are just early findings and presented in a very short way. More like an infographic than a study.   Esports is dominated (exclusively in LoL, at least) by males   Totally agree. In every sector of esports we looked at, it's very male-dominated.  Esports wasn't our focus, but we know it's a factor   This data needs to be disaggregated by the professional state of players.   We actually have been tagging esports professionals as such in relation to this study and have the ability to run the numbers again without those players. So that may remove your biggest complaint. Didn't include that info in this study, however.   individuals high on the viewer list will get more new viewers   Agreed, no arguments there. We did separate top from random, which helps some. And tried to examine percentages per hour streamed, not overall numbers, as that's how Twitch's official metrics are also designed for maximum fairness.   we need to look at the distribution of males vs females in games    I've looked for data. I don't have great data. Other platforms are also bad about reporting on gender. According to unofficial studies done on Steam, I did discover roughly 17% of Steam users are women, which falls in line with Twitch findings.   we don't have data showing whether females might prefer to watch females while males might prefer to watch males   Correct, we don't, although that is a question on our upcoming survey. We want demographics of viewers, too, but these sorts of numbers aren't publicly available to anyone.    We also don't have data on how social networks come into play   We would guess that a good 90% of top Twitch broadcasters do have social presences in relation to Twitch. I don't think that's a GENDER study, but I do think it'd be a good data study for someone. Maybe someone else will pick up that project (and they'd be free to use our gender data for it, as well)."

Twitch,3e0eqs,spla08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:55 2015 UTC,"4chan raids can be a nasty business. Ultimately, it's your channel and  your rules, so you and your mods can dictate the type of environment you want to have. In the long term, your channel will reflect you, so I recommend outlining some rules and expectations for your channel to follow. You develop a thicker skin to it, after awhile."
Twitch,3e0eqs,shiny_dunsparce,2,Tue Jul 21 00:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I just totally wasn't ready for it. There were probably 8 people in my room before the raid (it wasn't a big one but they killed my comment box with insults and spam) my only mod is my bf, as I'm brand new and I thought it was best to shut the stream down before they started digging for personal info.   For example, I had my real first name in my intro... I spell it uniquely and one Google or Facebook search would bring it up. My profile picture on twitch was an old Facebook profile picture. I shut my stream down for safety really.   Now I've taken out my name, taken new pictures specifically for twitch that can't be linked to Facebook, and tried to be as vague about myself as possible. Hopefully if I get raided again they won't find me."

Twitch,3e0eqs,KCIV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:23 2015 UTC,"a ""raid"" is an organized group of people showing simultaneously in your channel in chat. Preferably a raid should be bigger than the viewership of the channel before the raid, this way the raid can ""overtake"" the chat (mods are probably not ready do deal with such a surge of activity).  Raids can be entirely positive - just to bump someone is search ranking or come say hi, or they can be toxic. The most common type of raid is a streamer being done for the day with their stream and redirecting their viewers to someone else's channel to help them."
Twitch,3e0eqs,KCIV,2,Tue Jul 21 04:28:32 2015 UTC,It's worth mentioning here that any raid without the broadcaster's permission/agreement is a violation of the Twitch Rules of Conduct and abusive raiders can be reported for review.

Twitch,3e0eqs,spla08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"Very interesting data! I fully support your project, as someone who has a bit of experience with statistics (BA in PoliSci) allow me a few remarks concerning presentation and methodology, though.  1) While I wholeheartedly support the sentiment, going about a collection of data with the express intent to ""research"" or even debunk a ""myth"" makes your whole project more open to attack than necessary.   There are always specific motivations for collecting data but just seeing the results as a foregone conclusion can in some ways become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Data isn't as objective as we'd like to think. How and what we collect, how we present it and what we focus on can skew results towards our perspective more than we might think.  I'm not saying that is the case here - but it might very well be used as a point of attack.  I'm also not a fan of editorialising statistics by providing readers with a tl;dr in the very first sentence - ""confirmed"", ""partially confirmed"", etc. Why not just let the data stand for itself?   2) The second graph is a mess in so many ways. Putting percent on the y-axis is - while not a formal mistake - certainly uncommon. Putting the ""Distribution of gender"" on the x-axis is just bewildering, especially considering that ""Top 100"" is not a value you can express ""Distribution of gender"" in. Moreover, the values on the x-axis aren't consistent. The same distance represents very different things (0 (?) to Top 100, Top 100 to top 500, later top 2500 to random 2500 are all represented by the same distance).  All those values shouldn't even be on one axis at all, the data points shouldn't be connected at all, the spaces in between shouldn't be coloured. The data here should probably just have been presented in five separate pie charts.  3) What is the purpose of the up and down arrows in the third graphic? Are they supposed to signify a trend, maybe? If not they just seem like an effort to further editorialise the data - which really wouldn't have been necessary in this case, as it pretty much speaks for itself.  4) Are those dials/circles about the average hours streamed to scale? What are the values? How many hours does a male streamer stream on average? How many a female streamer? Why not mention this information?  5) I just plainly don't get the next graph. Maybe I'm overlooking something. What do the filled-in circle for pageviews and the empty circle for followers mean? What does ""Growth percentages. Adjusted to per-hour"" mean? Growth per hour streamed? Growth in what? Followers, concurrent viewers, page views?  All in all I think the data is very valuable and interesting. Please don't read this as an attack on the project or misinterpret it as me disagreeing with the findings. Just a couple of points I noticed. :)  Cheers"
Twitch,3e0eqs,Blackfan,-4,Tue Jul 21 01:58:00 2015 UTC,"Did you run data on viewer spikes?  You proved no concurrent viewers growth men vs woman did you run data to show non concurate viewers?

Many streamers top% all say its about time and consistent streaming long term. If that is true, then does not that answer the question? less average hours streamed thus less average growth?  Did you take into consideration Average hours streamed against growth (long term) and viewer growth (short term)?  I would love to see more graphics as well :) I love the nitty gritty. Box plots are typically my favorite, I could see some of these graphics being applied nicely to a box plot.  I think a few things are important in this discussion as well, firstly A.) the assumption of females taking over twitch is frankly dumb but is more than likely a result of seeing ""new girl streamers"" with unique dress and stream styles getting more attention quicker than the average male streamer. (not proven just a typical theory). I see the page view results being more or less the indicator of that theory.   B.) So the question isn't Females are taking over twitch as so much as it is ""its easier to get popular on twitch as a female"" which is proven not to be the case with the concurrent viewers data but would technically suggest its easier to get noticed (page views). Very interesting results indeed!  I would love to see some Semantic analytics applied to chat data from female vs male streamers but the issue of ""moderation"" comes into play. Sub only vs non sub only. Also comparing Communities as well. Average word per chat per channel, Top words per chat per channel, Time spent in Sub mode/non sub mode. Some very awesome work can be done to this discussion :) Glad to see a team working to that end!  I have a feeling various spellings of ""girl"" and ""boobs"" would be in the top% of words in female streamers (Sadly). But showing that data might be good towards the factual conversation about the treatment of women in online settings (specifically twitch)  REALLY nice to see data science being applied in useful ways like this. Also Love the fact you mention wanting of a larger data size, That is a credibility + in my book! Keep it up! Its good to see my passion of data being shared by you guys and applied in such a positive and unique way:)"

Many streamers top% all say its about time and consistent streaming long term. If that is true, then does not that answer the question? less average hours streamed thus less average growth?   Absolutely agree. I think that is the single-biggest factor why the women's concurrent growth is less than the men's: streams need consistent and lengthy schedules in order to gain traction. When we isolated to individual smaller streamers who streamed lots of hours, we found women to do as well as men in one-on-one comparisons, but we can't rule out potential other factors yet.    Did you take into consideration Average hours streamed against growth (long term) and viewer growth (short term)?   Not on an individual basis. Although that might be data we could produce. I think in general it's known that streamers (regardless of gender) grow best when they stream longer hours in a consistent way. That's what Twitch staff officially tell streamers.

Twitch,3e0eqs,KCIV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:09:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the service Twinge was already tracking a lot of information. Kind of a very deep data recording and reporting custom stack of software. We just ran reports and pulled from the data in special one-off queries. But there is talk of an API later because we recorded more than just gender meta-data to that database, which could be very useful to some people."

Twitch,3e0eqs,joan_hickson,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think I understand,  The goal was to show data on this topic, I didn't see any bias in there data.  The results show that females can pull in more page views but that doesn't turn into long term growth (debunking the myth).   can you explain more where you see any perceived bias? Or clarify what you mean :)"
Twitch,3e0eqs,shiny_dunsparce,2,Tue Jul 21 03:22:52 2015 UTC,"And ""the myth"" you seem to claim is debunked yourself, is a very 'wide' statement ""It's easier to be a woman on twitch"" ?yay/nay?  From this report, that doesnt even cover all questions that need answering, there are some things that seem to be easier for women and some tyings that seem to be harder.  So is what people decide is ""the most important thing when considering if a streamer has an easier time or not"" something subjective?  We need an objective definition of what ""having an easier time streaming"" means, before concluding anything from these numbers."
Twitch,3e0eqs,saintgravity,0,Tue Jul 21 03:31:28 2015 UTC,"I dont' think this report was meant to be a conclusion.... but rather an exploratory context that is a continuing process.

If OP has already concluded that these common claims are myths, then that's a conclusion drawn before analysing, and not a hypothesis he wants to prove or disprove."
Twitch,3e0eqs,nissepik,2,Tue Jul 21 03:59:04 2015 UTC,"No, he had a hunch, a hypothesis, and wished to engage in research to find if it's true. He and the group that helped him were open to the data proving or disproving these hunches. The myths were something I posited for debunking months ago because in my 1.5 years running this subreddit, I am often faced with presumptive struggling broadcasters who blame women and women's bodies for their short comings as a streamer. I mentioned one short statistic I managed to uncover myself, that women only make up 8 out of the top 100 broadcasters on Twitch and therefore are NOT taking over Twitch with their cleavage, and I shared this on an episode of Dropped Frames."

Twitch,3e0eqs,Tarfu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:57 2015 UTC,"well Those are good points. However the hypothesis will typically always be a ""bias"". But I can agree at least in part to tweaking the sentence to a little more scientific ;) But that is a small thing in my opinion. I could see it being ""Purpose: Exploring male and female growth in the area of twitch through data and gender comparisons"" But I will touch on this below.  the bias comes in the presentation. Did they present the data correctly? or with a slant. I did not personally see a slant.  I can see your point about the ""purpose"" however, clearly stating your purpose and being upfront about the data prevents that from being an issue. Readers are fully aware. That is the most important part. I see it more like sponsors, I hate people that don't state their sponsors on twitch, But when I know they are sponsored, I know to take things with a grain of salt.   I think this paper was honest, transparent, and upfront about itself and its goals."
Twitch,3e0eqs,TheLionFromZion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:26 2015 UTC,The way they present things: Claim presented>conclusion>representation of data.

Twitch,3e0eqs,One_Rocky,0,Tue Jul 21 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"But an educated person such as yourself should be able to read for your own and draw your own conclusions ;) that is the point. I can show you a graph PROVING (or at least showing)the relationship between Doritos sales and Suicides. That doesn't mean its true and educated people should evaluating these things.  the point is not for 1 person to make 1 claim and then that be the end of it. the point is to start a discussion bringing this report to the table. Were discussing minute issues in presentation. I think the presentation was good for its goal, and that goal is to start a conversation and explore this topic WITH data. Not definitively prove true or false in this 1 report. :)  I would rather discuss finer points about the process rather than the presentation.   That being said I can see your points."
Twitch,3e0eqs,Blackfan,-2,Tue Jul 21 03:53:51 2015 UTC,"I own Twinge and provided a lot of the data for this study. I think you make a valid point, we're seeing some interpretation of the data here. There are factors that need to be explored before it is 100% conclusive, in my opinion, but it opens up a lot for discussion. It does provide valuable insight about the current gender share and success on Twitch imo."

You probably should not cheat on stream in a multiplayer game like that  It's probably fine, Twitch staff are not especially strict with that.  Yes  Yes, as long as it's not the central focus of the game and its not especially pornographic. A sex scene in a bioware game is not going to get you banned, some genitals in GTA won't get you banned, but a tasteless dating sim full of graphic sex might. Also, that list of banned games someone else posted is another good place to start."

Twitch,3e3m0h,Monkeylarry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:53 2015 UTC,"Building a desktop will almost universally give you better results for your money than if you purchase a laptop. Only sticking point for that might be the peripherals like a monitor and keyboard since the laptop obviously comes with that.  That said, I wouldn't expect this laptop to do that well with streaming. Most of the time, you are limited by the CPU power of your machine when talking about encoding a stream, so a CPU in a laptop that is limited to a much lower wattage than a desktop is probably not going to give you the performance needed to produce a high quality stream. If we look at the best CPU in that laptop line, it is the i7-5500U. It scores on a 3,947 on CPU Benchmark here: http://cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-5500U+%40+2.40GHz&id=2470  A desktop Pentium G3258 scores higher than this chip, because it's a laptop chip with a TDP of 15W. It's not made for the kind of workloads that streaming will throw at it. I definitely would not get that laptop with any expectation of being able to stream. You might be able to handle a 360p or 480p stream depending on the game you are playing, but don't expect more than that."

Here is a pretty good build for under 600 (less if there are rebates or sales) that would function more or less the same, if not better. This post also includes a guide on how to build is well. My first build was about 550$ and lasted me about 2 years (I was also a bit of a building newbie) before I upgraded (Upgrading is also a massive plus for pc owners).  Gaming laptops, in my experience have always cost exponetionally more than a pc (probably because different parts, demand, yadda yadda). I would recommend building a pc and getting a cheap chromebook. The Toshiba Chromebook 2 Full HD is a great choice. I got one for my dad for his birthday and he loves it. Hell, I love it, Its a breeze to use and really quick with a nice display- Perfect for on-the-go. I'm not sure if this a good answer, but I hope this helps.

I do this a lot and I know many who do the same. If you have bad audio, people are far less likely to just lurk and listen in. Video quality for a non-partnered streamer is not as important since you really shouldn't be streaming in 1080p without transcoding. Stream should be smooth, not dropping frames, but professional quality video is not as important (nor is a camera/greenscreen) as good audio."

Twitch,3e4bwg,Pengwynd1,3,Tue Jul 21 21:19:24 2015 UTC,"Never compromise and do something you're not conformable doing. There is a different dynamic between streamer and viewer than there is between two random people on the internet. Some streamers have no problem doing things with their viewers off stream and the like, others don't (I can only assume a majority).   The best you can do is explain that it doesn't make you comfortable. If they don't understand that then perhaps it's better they aren't going to be one of your viewers."
Twitch,3e4bwg,Brawli55,2,Tue Jul 21 21:30:08 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this. I'm often asked to play follower games in CSGO, but I usually just say ""I'm not a fan of smurfing and it's not fun to beat up on lower ranked players and not .. blah blah blah"".  Whatever reason you have, it's your own and that's that.   The way I see it now: If I say, ok, enough people asked... I guess I should just do a follower game... <<< This is already a bad attitude and will take away from your stream. (In this case my stream). I won't be as into the match, I won't be talking as much (bored or feeling guilty). It ends up taking away from the stream in some ways.  (Though it does add to the stream in some ways too. I interact with viewers. But I usually notice viewership dip during a smurf game because I no longer am 'myself' and doing 'what I would be best at doing'. If that makes sense?).  But yea, don't do anything to put yourself out of your comfort zone. It takes away from your appeal as a streamer in my opinion just through how you'd act afterwards."

Your channel, it's graphics, layouts, choice of colours, games and style. Are all forms of you expressing yourself. In being active broadcasters it unfortunately seems like we have to deal with people almost demanding that appeal to just their ideals, likes and comforts.   I think of Twitch channels as equal to television channels, or even programmes on a certain channel. If you like one programme you're going to watch that programme.  I wouldn't call the writers of House of Cards and ask them to cast me in the next episode, sure they might consider it, but I'd be an absolute fool if I expected them to instantly write me in to the next episode and fly me out to film it.   The analogy, in short, tried to say in a very convoluted way, that TV executives don't bend to the demands of single viewers and they don't lose an ounce of sleep over it. So neither should you."

Twitch,3e3avf,CandyFrag,2,Tue Jul 21 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"Don't know about the direct answer to that. You'll probably want to make sure you screw it into a 2x4 honestly, not just the dry wall. Unless this is a REALLY light monitor. You'd have to see what your apartment complex says about it. It might be more reasonable to get a monitor stand that is meant for one monitor above another.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA3BG16C7864&cm_re=2_monitor_stand_vertical-_-9SIA3BG16C7864-_-Product  ^ Becareful however... the base takes up a lot of space 'towards you'.

You can also go horizontal with a side by side version of the above mount, but only if you can fit a second monitor on the side, and the desk base is your problem.  Also also, if you do get a second monitor mostly for chat, I HIGHLY suggest making it vertical rather than horizontal. The real estate is spectacular."
Twitch,3e3avf,ollee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"I'd be careful with any orientation, however. First of all, being vertical when it's already above your head is kind of... daunting in my opinion. Just way too much 'need to tilt my head back all the way to see anything'.   But more importantly, there's a reason the base is as 'far reaching' as it is on monitor stands. It's to prevent it from tipping over from all the weight above and in front of it. If you tip the monitor too much, expect to have a mini heart attack (unless you fail to catch it. Then you'll have an actual one)."
Twitch,3e3avf,Kalikovision64,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:54:07 2015 UTC,"Owning one of those stands(the 3+1 model) I can attest to it's stability until you get a lot of weight on top of it. It is better to clamp it down, and theres hardware to bolt it through a desk if seen fit, but have the 1+1 setup is actually surprisingly stable with just the feet that come with it. That is as long as your desk is stable of course, and not a plastic folding banquet table like I was using."

Twitch,3e46rg,Imagine42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:59:22 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, a lot of it is about branding. Having distinctive graphics that work together to create a style that works with the streamer's style. These days, the streamer has to stand out too. You have to think about what you bring to the table that's different. Also, a HUGE thing isn't just viewers, but chat interaction. If you have 100+ viewers and no one is ever talking, that's not something Twitch wants to see. Also also, Twitch is looking at different numbers than you are (unless you're the streamer). I'm talking about the numbers in your dashboard that aren't available for 24 hours after the stream. Sorry for not being more articulate, I'm running on way too little sleep at the moment. =)"

Might  be worth looking into. In terms of your question, I don't believe you will see any difference in viewers from 2500kbps to 2000kbps. I've been streaming at the 2500 for well over a year now and I get very few complaints that people are unable to load my streams."

Twitch,3e37ei,Pipnotiq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:46 2015 UTC,Alright so I got home and tried this but yea.... it basically its like running a second OBS. My best option for this is using a capture card on another PC and use that to do both but to record at 1080p60fps and stream at 720p60fps on the same pc is not going to be happening on an i7 3770 even as a streaming only PC. I might be able to do it on my 5820k but honestly its probably not worth it. I appreciate the info tho.
Twitch,3e37ei,MellowNebula,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"Well, there's no way around running 2 encoders if you want to record and stream at different qualities. Multiplatform should at least be better than running 2 instances of OBS at least because there is only 1 renderer rather than 2."

Twitch,3e2lv7,pascalbrax,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:49 2015 UTC,"Record yourself using a Clapperboard (or clap your hands) and import the resulted video in a movie editor with separated video and audio tracks.  Slide the audio tracks until it matches with the video track, the difference is the amount of time you have to delay."
Twitch,3e2lv7,Upstagebuffalo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:57 2015 UTC,Just keep changing the delay slightly until you get it right.  Start at 2 seconds and work your way up or down from there.
Twitch,3e2lv7,JNeill98,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:20 2015 UTC,"Right but my question/concern is that, I am confused which audio I need to delay.   My PS4 microphone is my blue yeti USB which is being used to speak to party chat in PS4. However, the microphone my stream hears me talking in is my Astro Headset Mic which is connected through my optical cable to the PS4 as well. This is how it worked and was set up. Stream runs crystal clear and audio works but my audio and reaction is about 1-2 seconds behind  I am unsure which audio I need to delay in that case, any suggestions?"

Twitch,3e3yx4,flyingsmitty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:05 2015 UTC,This is also one of my least favorite things about Twitch on XB1. I've heard people will use a Skype call to mic all of the players in the group. I've never tried it though.
Twitch,3e3yx4,Actionfrank315,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:50:27 2015 UTC,"Skype works great, as long as you have the call connected on your computer so the audio runs through OBS. You could also rig up your controller to connect to your Elgato, provided you're using one, to capture party chat.  Skype is basically included with your XBL account, so everyone has an account, and it's free. The second method of connecting your party chat to your Elgato, while not expensive at all, does have a minor cost associated with it. I got the cables required at an electronics store for ~$11 total, but I'm sure you can find them on Amazon a lot cheaper."

Twitch,3e0spx,Pawn1990,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:43:21 2015 UTC,What about consistency regarding games ? I don't always wanna play the same game until it's through. But I'm afraid that switching between games will hurt the stream
Twitch,3e0spx,Td4rk0n3,2,Tue Jul 21 10:44:42 2015 UTC,"I had to figure that out too. These days I do 2 (or 3) two hour blocks. I have 1 of 3 main games people can expect every night (Dirty Bomb/Garry's Mod/TF2) and I use the opening few hours to experiment with things. I've done Half-Life 2, Psychonauts, Ninja Blade, Rocket League, Hitman, Condemened and so many others over the last few weeks. Doing it like this allows me to start a game and get feedback on whether or not I should continue with it. People also don't expect me to just focus on one game now. I used to just do games start to finish and then move onto the next one. Doing the block system with my streams worked wonderfully. Viewer Fatigue went down. I got less burned out (I seriously had a month where I only did Persona 4) & I have what feels like two completely different chats through the night (some people show up just for block one. Others show up only for block two. Some show up for both). Having a main fallback game is great because if an idea for a new playthrough you wanted to do ends up being a bust you have something to fall back on without having to worry."
Twitch,3e2g63,hfcobra,2,Tue Jul 21 13:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yes you can!  I have a 144hz monitor but most capture cards only capture in 60 hz.  If you have nvidia you can use the nvidia control panel to clone your main monitor onto the capture card via the the second dvi port or hdmi, whatever your card has.  The thing is once you clone it, your 144hz monitor will be defaulted back to 60hz and nvidia control panel won't let you set it to 144hz.    But there is a work around, just right click your desktop, select screen resolution, select your clone monitor(s) and set it 144hz, hit apply and you're done!  You now can game at 144hz while the capture card sees it in 60 hz.  Message me if you need more info."

Twitch,3e2g63,wda_exodus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:23:07 2015 UTC,I am using Dual-DVI.  I could use DP though if I bought a cable.
Twitch,3e2g63,Upstagebuffalo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:08:41 2015 UTC,For NVIDIA cards you can clone your display so that you can use your DVI for 144hz and send HDMI out at 60Hz to your capture device/stream rig.

After what i assume to be a decent amount of planning, futuremangaming was born. he posted his intro on reddit and began his maiden voyage.  When i saw the intro and popped in, i was hooked. He is an excellent example of a persona done right. he can act the role, he can still make people feel comfortable, and it doesn't come off as ""forced"" or any of that, so i think that's the key.  either way you go, you have to make it feel natural. if you create a persona, and act that persona out but don't do a decent job at it..it comes off as pretty cringe.  Personally, I just go with my old, natural self. i know  that at least right now, there is no way i would be able to create a persona and have it come across as something not cringe.  the biggest setback of ""just being yourself"" is the obvious one: you (likely) won't attract many viewers in a quick time frame, but there is no guarantee even if you have a persona...but it does help!"

I realize /u/futuremangaming has an amazing persona he created, which is a part of his theme.  In this case his theme would be the NERF idea, and he went full force and created a persona with it all.  Would you say that if you do have a theme, that you need to be 100% and create a persona as well? I can definitely see that if you create a theme from the start, you might need to be that hardcore about it.  In that case, it might be better for a natural theme to be created that the community creates and rallies around."

Most channels in that sense i think it tends to happen more organically to begin with, often from an inside joke that happens on stream with your viewers. i also think that's why building a community on twitch is such a powerful thing, because your viewers help you effect your channel, which isn't something that happens anywhere else usually!"

Your problem, however, will be the delay it takes for it to get from Giantbomb to Twitch.  It won't happen by Friday, even if it already exists on Giantbomb.    I swear, the connection is broken or something. I tweeted TwitchSupport looking to get some games added already on GB and it's been dead silence.    Software Inc. has been on GB since June 26th, still not on Twitch. Holy Potatoes! A Weapon Shop? on GB July 15th, also not on Twitch (but a far more recent add).    It typically does not take this long at all.  I've seen a game added to GB sync up with Twitch the very next day.    What you can do is free-hand the game name to your channel on your channel page (Not Dashboard).  Believe it or not, that 'Edit' field will accept a game name not in the drop-down.  The consequence of doing this is that your video will not save to that directory page, because that directory page doesn't exist.  As well, no one will find you playing that game, because again, the directory page doesn't exist.    Ultimately, we're at the mercy of the poor Giantbomb directory system and Twitch Support."

Twitch,3e24n8,FadedSlowBro,2,Tue Jul 21 11:04:21 2015 UTC,"There are two options:   either your viewer has a bad connection that can't handle the stream or you are streaming at a ""too high"" bitrate for Twitch to be delivering the stream reliably to everyone (small channels having their stream only delivered by one server in LA).   Whatever reason it is, just make sure you stream at something like 1500-2000kpbs as long as you have a small viewer base so that almost everyone can watch you in good conditions. But there will always be people with worse connections (or on mobile) or Twitch having hick-ups at times. It's just a matter of reducing the chances for it to happen."
Twitch,3e24n8,Epileptic_Toad,2,Tue Jul 21 13:33:17 2015 UTC,Don't worry my bitrate is pretty low sitting at 2000 right now. The reason why he's having issues is because I believe he's in Aussie.
Twitch,3e24n8,weefz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:28:26 2015 UTC,My viewers usually recommend Livestreamer with VLC for people who have problems like that. Not used t myself but worth a shot for yours.
Twitch,3e24n8,mk101,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:52:18 2015 UTC,"Livestreamer works great for me, I use it for the same situations. Seems to prioritise bandwidth or something.   If I'm downloading on Steam and watching Twitch in the browser, it'll usually lag, but if I watch using Livestreamer while downloading, it's the download rate for Steam that drops, not the the stream."
Twitch,3e24n8,RJBEntertainment,3,Tue Jul 21 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"This is an issue that I've been having for a year now. It's because you're broadcasting at a high bitrate (aka a good bitrate). Twitch has the quality options that they're supposed to implement on streams that run at higher qualities and have a certain number of followers/viewers. Sadly, these ""guidelines"" are generally not followed and instead they largely select based on gender. My female friend tested this idea out by starting streaming. Three days later, with 20 followers, she got the quality options. It's pathetic but that's Twitch."
Twitch,3e24n8,iambgriffs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:52:11 2015 UTC,"So not for nothing here but transcoding options are based on concurrent viewers. Your stream being higher bitrate or ""quality"" has nothing to do with whether or not you get them."
Twitch,3e24n8,flexstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah its this, during the quiet times generally having over 20 viewers will get you quality options!"
Twitch,3e24n8,RJBEntertainment,2,Tue Jul 21 12:44:40 2015 UTC,"I know when the question of guidelines has been asked on Twitch's help page, on several occasions over the past few months moderators have stated that it took bitrate, viewers, and followers into account. I've been following the issue over there for obvious reasons. Could have just been some misinformed mods though. Either way, they still are very inconsistent with their selection process."
Twitch,3e24n8,Epileptic_Toad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:41:56 2015 UTC,"There is no ""selection process"", it's automatic as far as I know. When all the partners don't take all the resources for transcoding, the remaining resources will be allocated to non-partner streamers in concurrent viewer order."
Twitch,3e24n8,RJBEntertainment,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:05 2015 UTC,I was just going on what I was told. It made no sense to me for there to be a manual process. It should be automatic. That's just what some mods said. It still doesn't dismiss the fact that it doesn't work correctly all the time. That's the only point I was trying to make.   tl;dr The best option for him (or anyone) is just continue streaming and hope that eventually you'll get the transcoding feature. Otherwise you'll have to lower your stream quality.

Twitch,3e02wi,weefz,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, there was a bug in a recent version that broke the auto-updater. Once you get a fixed version from the website, it should update as normal again."
Twitch,3e02wi,jkkennedy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:28:15 2015 UTC,I had the same thing going on. I did the followimg to get the newest version.   download the newest version from the website install the newest version in another directory where you installed AnkhBot. copy the Twitch folder from your old version to the newely installed AnkhBot.   This way you import your settings etc. etc.

Twitch,3e0xiz,BuffyDoesBroadcast,3,Tue Jul 21 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"OK, so will do my best to give you some pointers.  Keep in mind I only have about 270 followers but have doubled that in past month or so.     Quality is important - Mic, video, your gameplay, knowledge, interaction. Be respectful to your viewers/followers.  Treat them like gold.  Interact with them, be personable.  If they followed you, there was SOME reason.  It's your loyal followers tuning in regularly that will help you grow. When someone follows you, acknowledge/thank them.  Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT have a bot or something setup to acknowledge someone specifically that is viewing but not communicating with you except for follows. It's creepy and a turn-off I have both read and found by just viewing others' when they say ""Hi TheNinjaGuyDon.... when I'm just checking them out for 2 minutes"".  My opinion, but wouldn't do it. Wizebot, Moobot, Nighdev.  I'd use a combination of all 3.  I recommend Wizebot starting out for follower notification until you get better with other resources.  But it will show up in chat and seems pretty reliable, a good option for beginners.  I use Moobot for Raffles and Nightdev for other notifications like reminders to checkout youtube, or whatnot.  If possible, have a schedule, make your channel look legit, and have fun.  It is a lot of time and effort, but it is worth it.     Oh, and don't stream games that 1000 other people are streaming, you'll never get noticed (GTA5 for example).  I streamed Rory Mcilroy PGA Golf today and had 50-80 viewers for 4 hours tonight.  When only 4 people are streaming a week old game, the odds are in your favor.    Good luck!"
Twitch,3e0xiz,TheNinja_GuyDon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:33:38 2015 UTC,Nice advice! I've never heard of Wizebot before!
Twitch,3e0xiz,BuffyDoesBroadcast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"You don't really have to worry too much about getting botted. It's an ongoing issue that twitch is working on, so all you really need to do is report it and move on. Report and ignore and the botter will eventually get bored and leave.   If the bots are spamming too much then just use some moderation commands to limit it. Commands like /subscribers or /r9kbeta or /slow are useful for this.  What other topic you have in mind?"
Twitch,3e0xiz,Oblimix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:12:29 2015 UTC,"That's a relief then. Well, two days ago I learned how to actually make someone a moderator (haha). My next questions are:   Is there anything you recommend I should download to help my Twitch? Like moobot - I downloaded that today. Don't really know how to use it. But I'll figure t out. What do you recommend not doing? I have a 1 month of EA access I would like to give away. But of course, I have barely just started. Around when do you think I should do this? And how? By viewers? Followers? Any specific things I should watch out for? Like I previously said, the whole viewer botted thing.  What do you recommend I do about the.. Uh, well let's say the guys that come into my Twitch and say inappropriate things. I sometimes ignore what they say. Should I block certain words or things or.. I don't even know. Like I said, I'm new to this."
Twitch,3e0xiz,Oblimix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:08:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really worry too much about adding moderating bots when you're just starting. If by some point you do get frequent viewers or spam then I'd recommend trying Nightbot or Xanbot. Both bots have an easy to use control panel on their site and are easy to set up. Whatever you do, don't go advertising your channel on someone else's channel. It is quite rude to do so. Many people do giveaways in order to grow their own channel, and it works when starting out. I'd recommend organizing a goal before doing a giveaway, like once you reach 100 followers you could pick one of them to win or something similar. Just be aware of Twitch's ToS and you should be fine. Remember the site is largely gaming related site, so streaming movies or showing illegal content is a big no-no. Certain 'Adults Only' games are also banned on twitch. Also people discussing piracy in chat and sharing piracy-related stuff can even get the streamer in trouble if not moderated. You're free build your own community as you like. Some people like to discuss mature stuff with others in chat, but then you should tick the 'mature content' option in settings. If you don't like a person that joins your chat, then you're in full right to either timeout the person for however long you want or permanently ban him if you want for whatever reason. It's your chat after all."
Twitch,3e0xiz,Oblimix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:57 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your feedback oh my goodness. I didn't think you would reply! I have a few more questions (if that's okay).    Is there anything I can download that tells me when someone has followed my Twitch? To thank them. I always see streamers being notified whenever someone new has followed them.  How exactly does nightbod work? I've seen some people using that but I'm a little bit clueless on it.
Twitch,3e0xiz,ShinyGoombah,2,Tue Jul 21 05:57:36 2015 UTC,"No worries.   The same people that made Nightbot also have a follower alert you can use. Simply go here and follow the instructions as you install it. You can get nightbot to join your chat by going to https://www.nightbot.tv/  You just have to log in with your twitch user account and authorize it. The control panel's interface is very user friendly, but you will just need a few minutes to familiarize yourself with it. You will also need to mod the bot once it's in your chat by typing ""/mod nightbot"" in chat. Once it is in your chat you can customize it to follow certain commands if you'd like, or just leave it by default."
Twitch,3e0xiz,riseyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:27 2015 UTC,"Hello!  I know you have gotten some pretty good help already, so I will just kind of add my two cents.    I visited your channel and noticed that you don't have Past Broadcasts on. I would highly recommend enabling this. You can find the option in your settings. I don't remember which tab it's under, but the reason that it's really helpful is so for situations like this where you're looking for help/advice people can go back and look at the streams you've done and understand you as a streamer better. I noticed in your conversation with /u/Oblimix you were wondering about follow alerts and such. Nightbot does have a good one, but I personally you streampro.io. It's still new, and still in development, but the people working on it have been outstanding. I have been in personal contact with /u/Jokosmash several times about potential future features, and issues with getting something on my overlay up and running. I would suggest looking at it if you are interested. I use moobot, and really the only thing I have used it for is to set up a custom command that gives links to my twitter and facebook automatically based on certain requirements (time passed, and how active chat is). Setting up a twitter would be very helpful, and making a link to it in your panels. Use it to keep your viewers updated about any issues, and you can use it to tweet out when you are going live. There is even an option to have you twitter send out a tweet automatically when you start your stream.   Hope I've helped, might stop by your channel at some point. I gave a follow."

Something must have changed, any way to find out what the problem is? :/"

Twitch,3dyqa2,joan_hickson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:55 2015 UTC,"i'm having the same issue, i watch streams on multiple devices- they buffer out at exactly the same time, a few times a week, whether or not the streamers have transcodes. could be my isp? but i'm not sure.  i'll have one stream going on my laptop and a different one on my ipad mini app. the streamers are all in different locations including east coast, west coast, and canada. the buffering started around the time of transcode benevolence, it was fine for 2 months before that.   ISP: Cox comm.,~50mbps,  LOC: PHX, AZ metro"
Twitch,3dyqa2,chhopsky,3,Mon Jul 20 19:00:53 2015 UTC,"The originating streamers location only affects how the stream originates to Twitch - after it reaches us, and is rebroadcast/transcoded/transmuxed/whateveryouwanttocallit, our ""best path"" to your computer is going to be the same no matter where it came from originally.  That's time relative though - the system is constantly updating itself trying to find ""better"" paths so your path one day could be different from another.  To put it more simply, the stream goes Streamer->Twitch->You.  The Streamer picks which part of Twitch they send to, but the Twitch->You algorithm is going to pick the best path at the time, to you.  Hope this helps."
Twitch,3dyqa2,Anubis169,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:24:59 2015 UTC,"I'm getting the same problem from the UK, it started on the 16th. Currently on GCI Com and in the UK (east anglia).  Before the 16th I used to be able to run 1 stream on source and another on medium, ever since then I've struggled to run one stream on low (medium at best if I don't mind the stream dropping/rebuffering every minute or so).  I've done a traceroute to one of the streams I was attempting to watch if it'd help? :)"
Twitch,3dyqa2,chhopsky,2,Mon Jul 20 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"That will help!  The other thing you can do is right click on the stream and click Video Stats.  This will show you all the important data about your current video stream, including latency, framerate, frame size and bandwidth being used etc.  Most important is buffer size.  If your buffer reaches zero, your video will stutter.  Pay close attention to whether this buffer is refilling rapidly then burning down, or staying reasonably constantly low.  Let me know how it goes?"
Twitch,3dyqa2,Anubis169,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:40 2015 UTC,"I've PM'd the test to ya :)  My buffer was filling slowly and emptying shockingly fast, ended up never getting above 3 seconds worth in its store at the best of times. Rebuffers are very frequent, approximately once every 8-9 seconds on source, less on high but still very frequent."
Twitch,3dyqa2,be4rgryllzz,4,Mon Jul 20 21:56:09 2015 UTC,"/u/chhopsky Pretty much the same here, I'm from Germany though. This is what the stream looks like on source: http://i.imgur.com/1lEqt4B.png  Buffer size is constantly very low, sometimes it's a bit more stable though. Seems to be a bandwidth problem with one of Europe's servers I guess? I haven't noticed any other websites besides twitch being slow tbh.  For reference, these are the stats for the stream on high:  http://i.imgur.com/0egXAzE.png (btw those drops in fps/skipped frames is from switching tabs, nothing to do with it.) Buffer size is around 5-12 seconds, and it very rarely buffers. But as you can see from the red bar, it gets pretty close sometimes. I remember that my source streams looked like that, having a ""spiky"" buffer size and staying around 10s roughly. Something definitely changed, started on the 15th/16th like /u/Anubis169 said."
Twitch,3dyqa2,chhopsky,3,Tue Jul 21 01:34:29 2015 UTC,"So, we can take a look at the spiky buffer a little closer to show some details about how streaming works in general.  The computer will try to maintain an optimum buffer size, so it will fill its maximum buffer size, then bleed some off and start filling up again.  The fact that the 'up' side is faster than the 'down' side means that you can receive it faster than you can play it back.  It quickly refills the buffer and slowly bleeds it off, predictably.  It needs to get 1.5mbps to keep itself full, and it gets it.  Now look at the slow buffer.  It's struggling - you'll get an instant of bursty download and then it just starts bleeding.  When it does come back it creeps up slowly - you're only very slowly pulling down data faster than you can play it, and then it bleeds dry slowly again.  It's not regular either.  Notice how each upward and downward curve is unique.  The stream is fighting for bandwidth in order to maintain its 3.1mbps rate.  I'd say your bandwidth is peaking at around 3.4mbps but then getting congested and falling back to around 2.3mbps.  Even with this minimum it's still managing to keep a High stream afloat but at Source it just can't keep the pipe full.  Hope this helps explain what you're seeing!  In all likelihood this will be a congested transit link somewhere.  I suggest testing streaming at different times of day, as most congestion is time-based due to user habits.  Try in the middle of the night, or early morning, any time you normally wouldn't.  If you want to post back the stream graph then, I'm sure the other users would appreciate it!"
Twitch,3dyqa2,be4rgryllzz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:16:57 2015 UTC,"The tests above were done at about 2AM in Europe, GMT+1 to be exact. Streams buffer no matter what time it is, even in the morning which is weird imo. Only on some rare occasion a stream will not buffer, I watched one at 10PM yesterday (which should be peek time) and it mostly ran fine, still a pretty small buffer size though that kept getting close to 0, but hovered more around 5. Anyways, the question is how to fix this problem? It's greatly influencing the experience many users - including myself - have with twitch. Do I have to ask my ISP to route differently? Even though the ""problem"" is not twitch's fault directly, there has to be something you guys can do about it. I mean every other site runs fine, there must be some cheap hosting/routing between some of us Europe users and your servers here :/ I'd be glad to help troubleshoot it, I just wanna watch twitch again with 60fps and decent bitrate :P"

Streamers are providing literal free content on Twitch, even more so if the viewer has ad block turned on.   I simply cannot understand the mentality of someone who would find a tip / donation button erroneous; your outlook on the matter is the audacious one, not the streamer suggesting they be compensated for their time.  That said, streamers who spend a lot of their asking for donations are another matter entirely, a discussion for another thread, but to lump streamers with any form of tip / donation under the tent of something empirically wrong is just asinine.   The common justification of that mentality, that that thought process is only reserved for  newbie streamers with less than 100 followers is utterly arbitrary. From Lirik to someone who started streaming today, they are giving up their time to provide free entertainment for others; it would be like kicking away the hat of a street performer as he strums his guitar because they aren't as big as Jack Johnson.  Full disclosure - I stream and have a donation button (so my opinion on the matter can be considered biased)."

If you are looking for opinion, then here's my 2 cents, which is the same way I am building my channel. You have to develop your channel first. Spend some time figuring out what people can get from your channel that they can't get anywhere else. Learn what your audience responds to. Find ways to improve every new cast. Become a channel people WANT to watch. Streaming is a very personal venture, so you will need to be invested in your audience first. If they know you genuinely care about them, then they will be more prone to return the favor. Monetary support is only ONE way people can do that.   I personally do not have a donate button yet. I am in the process of developing several show on my channel, content on other platforms, as well as producing other peoples channels. When I get to the point where I believe that my growth is predictably trending upward, my quality is solid, and I've shown that I aim to provide value and entertainment FIRST then and only then, I will put up a button. Promoting that button is another conversation :)  There are my thoughts. I can talk shop all day. If you want to chat, HMU! :)  Cast on!  Dom"

Twitch,3dzpxd,NerdyChinaMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:00:36 2015 UTC,"Thats why i added my button. people asked for it. But i also think it can not hurt to have one after a few month of streaming, even without people asking :)"
Twitch,3dzpxd,WaterTribe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:05:40 2015 UTC,I think having a donate button is fine so long as you don't ask for donations. People that don't want to donate will never even know it's there and it is great to have for those that wish to donate.
Twitch,3dzpxd,murderbits,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:31:57 2015 UTC,In my opinion it's perfectly fine to have a tip/donation button as long as've you put some effort in your channel. If it's the first and only thing you did when setting up your stream I don't really like it.
Twitch,3dzpxd,rallei_lol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:45:11 2015 UTC,Add the donate button to your stream.  There is no harm in having it there as long as you aren't shoving it down people's throats.  People who are against a donate button on small streamers aren't the types of people who spend a lot of time donating to and watching small streams
Twitch,3dzpxd,pascalbrax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:16 2015 UTC,"Two or 3 of my followers have requested I put a donate button up. I'll start a patreon eventually. People have opposing expectations, but that's to be expected with any large crowd."
Twitch,3e21li,ANIMATE1016,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:22:58 2015 UTC,Quality is good enough for normal twitch user. You do need to remember that 60 fps smooth quality needs more bitrate and then it come´s to problem bc there is people´s who cant watch even 2000 kb with 60 fps. But nice to see that you dropped settings down for your last post..

Twitch,3e21li,hapa90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:53 2015 UTC,I posted a link in a previous post. I'm curious really if anybody has any comments in the log file regarding the custom x264 settings
Twitch,3e21li,purplekoolaidguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:28 2015 UTC,One particular streamer I watch( and we have a similar setup) is twitch.tv/darkness_429  He is at 720p60 and it looks great. If u look at his past broadcasts u have to go back a little to find some BF4 stuff. He's been on the Rocket League lately :-)  I appreciate u guys taking the time to look at my stuff!
Twitch,3e21li,Tyrant84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:08 2015 UTC,I am streaming too on second computer playing with Battlefield 4 so we are same boat :). But for me 2000 kbs and 30 fps is good enough if people´s can actually watch that. And i don´t think that it look that bad. Look´s pretty good for that resolution btw.

This will likely be my primary source of tracking bugs/issues moving forward since my codebase will live on github for others to fork and help out with.

Twitch,3dxnq3,Growlibi,17,Mon Jul 20 11:33:54 2015 UTC,"Research, and show evidence of personal investment in your own growth. I'm not talking like ""dropping mad stacks"". Instead, I am talking about a streamer who is constantly reading about equipment, software tweaks, practicing talking, getting better at making overlays or improving layout. Generally investing in the quality of stream, commonly time invested, and shares what they're doing. Over the next Y months I want to grow this much each month, and I want to make these improvements by doing this and this. If I go off track, could you just yell THIS WORD in chat and I can get back on track, thanks!  That sort of stuff."
Twitch,3dxnq3,ollee,8,Mon Jul 20 13:27:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I got a ""don't try so hard"" a few times when I talked about stuff you mentioned. My viewers just don't realize that streamers spend a lot of time not streaming working on their streams."
Twitch,3dxnq3,Nyaliah,3,Mon Jul 20 15:36:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love the effort shown. Making it known that you CARE about your stream, you will be there the next time they return, and you REALLY want to succeed. It shows a certain character trait as a level of dedication that I admire."
Twitch,3dxnq3,ollee,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:25 2015 UTC,I really like this as well. I do find myself going to see older content that streamers had produced(usually on YT) and seeing how far they have come.

Twitch,3dxnq3,reedmanisback,4,Mon Jul 20 13:36:54 2015 UTC,"So as a viewer I theoretically agree with you, and prefer streams to have about as little of this as possible (outside of asking for viewers to kindly raid someone, etc.)  The problem there is - if you ask for these kind of things correctly, they're straight up more likely to happen and will be beneficial to you and your stream's growth.  There is definitely a balance to be found, of course, and lots of levers that can be tweaked.  E.g., you don't need donations scrolling on screen, but you can have a brief popup when one happens.  You don't need to tell people to follow every 20 minutes, but you can ask for it when you go on break or have a bot that periodically drops a follow request every hour."

Also don't get so invested in pleasing specific viewers. Do what you are going to do.

Of course keep your following happy, but remember, you can't please them all."

Twitch,3dxnq3,SwordofPoke,7,Mon Jul 20 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"Yesterday, I was raided by approximately 25 'trolls' they were spamming nightbot commands, telling me mic didn't work, other nonsense. I welcomed the raid, we banned a few for being extremely ridiculous, timed out some others. I talked with them, asked them questions, thanked them for the views and of course the 'Test'. A few were confused by my acceptance and stuck around and gave me follows, which I then allowed them to participate in a little game we were playing. I still expect a couple more to unfollow, but it has been 24 hours and of the 7 people from the raid that followed me, only 1 has unfollowed.    I worry for streamers who have never experienced these trolls and have no mods on. It can really crush someones confidence! Anyways my point is, look at the trolls as a test because as we grow, there will be plenty of them! Learn from them and move on."

Also a filled out profile is nice. Invest in a quality mic. I don't care how awesome your video quality is... if your mic is a potato, I don't stick around long.  For bigger streamers, aside from a high quality laid back stream, if you're capable of keeping your chat from becoming a spam-filled AIDSfest and manage to have a clean mature chat despite having hundreds or thousands of viewers, you have my full attention."

Personally, I'm a variety caster and I've carefully constructed a strong playlist of music I use while streaming, and it is specifically a reason people visit and enjoy my stream.  I've cultivated the playlist such that 20-second junk tracks (e.g. 'sleeping at the inn' in and RPG) aren't present.  I attempt to have a moderate variety of music (chiptunes, classical, techno) while also trying to ensure that nothing is excessively jarring for non-fans of the genre or disruptive to the stream (volume equalized across the board, minimal lyrics, no intense metal or EDM).  Basically - do it how you want to do it, while keeping the viewer in mind.  I use the playlist when starting up the stream, for games without music, and for games I'm not fond of or tired of the music, but otherwise will generally use the game's music."

As long as I launch the notifier on my gaming pc, the sound will be played on it."
Twitch,3e0quv,Brawli55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:33 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to imply you use should beer using Xsplit, more showing that we have a similar setup. I'm still scratching my head as to why you are using Skype though. Is it so you can talk in-game to people while you stream?"
Twitch,3e0quv,Brawli55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"I understand the confusion, it sounds weird when I think about it myself.  Basically I can only send my mic to my gaming pc and because my capture card is only capturing video, it has no way to pick up my mic.  Hence the Skype call with the two computers, so the streaming pc will hear my voice."
Twitch,3e0quv,Brawli55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:36 2015 UTC,"I have the same capture card as you - it can definitely capture audio. That said, unless you need to talk to people in-game on the gaming PC (which I don't know if this is the main reason you're audio is set up this way for), the streaming PC can get the audio from your mic and you can use the audio from the streaming software to hear the game, notifications, etc."
Twitch,3e0quv,Brawli55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't know it could do that.  I thought it's audio capture was for consoles only.  But yes I do need to talk to people on my gaming pc, though I will look into this.  Do you notice any delay in the sound when going through the capture card?"
Twitch,3e0quv,purplekoolaidguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"If your source uses HDMI you can use something like this to aget the audio: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002EVPCRO/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_TcMRvbVPD743N  We use HDMI as a source for our gaming PC and HD consoles; it's a common misconception that DVI can only do video.  Anyway there is a delay on the card's capture - for some people they can't sense it all (like my co-host, for example). It's less then a second, half a second even, but that doesn't matter since we use a splitter - the HDMI source goes into the splitter then from there an HDMI goes to the capture card, and another goes to a monitor we use as our playing screen. We use Xsplit to hear the audio from the game.  As for your issue, I'm assuming you are playing games like DayZ that have a proximity based in-game mic system? Cause if not, and you're playing something like ... League, you could just talk to people over an audio call on the streaming PC itself."
Twitch,3e1d6p,Knort27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt you'd be able to use up 500GB of data a month by watching twitch streams, unless you almost watch 24/7.  Let's assume your average stream uses a bitrate of 2000kbps. In order to use 500GB of data you would need to have it running for 23.15 continuous days (unless I miscalculated).  Of course it does contribute a lot to the overall usage, but I doubt you use it that much.  edit: And yes, lowering the quality of the stream does lower its bitrate, and thus use less data. This option is only available in channels that are twitch partners, so it won't work everywhere."
Twitch,3e1d6p,Oblimix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:27:46 2015 UTC,"If you watch a 2000 kbit/s stream for 4 hours a day on 30 days a month, then it comes to a bit over 100 GByte.  Just to clarify, when you say your data cap is ""500gb"", do you mean it's 500 Gigabytes or 500 Gigabits? 500 Gb (small b) technicially means Gigabits, although it's less commonly used I guess, so most people mean Gigabytes in that context."

If you really need a solution to moderation then convince the streamers to add more a few mods or use one of the bots available (nightbot or xanbot are great)  Of course if you really want to multitask then you could use a multitwitch site, like this one, and watch a few simultaneously."
Twitch,3e0ned,Oblimix,2,Tue Jul 21 01:47:12 2015 UTC,Modding is short for moderating as well.
Twitch,3e0ned,laagone,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"Not really. Modding is slang for modify, as in modifying contents in games. Mod or mods are usually slang used for moderation."

Twitch,3e0ned,Ramautso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:58 2015 UTC,"Having Chatty on background and configuring it appropriately (e.g. setting highlights and desktop notifications for stuff like bad words) does help if you want to mod multiple chats at once, but unless there is a complete lack of other mods, I find it better in the long run to focus on the one you're watching. If you can focus on watching and modding multiple streams at once (which I like doing by popping out chat and the stream and placing them side by side), that's of course good, but it shouldn't be expected of you to be able to do it for up to 53 channels. Switching between them rapidly has its disadvantages, for example you may miss context on something and not know it's no longer allowed."

Then maybe consider trying to contact twitch to convince them this is a sport they need on their platform for people to see."
Twitch,3e16e8,distortednet,2,Tue Jul 21 04:55:46 2015 UTC,"It isn't necessary to be mainstream. Very little of what Twitch serves up is mainstream and it is by nature a service with a niche audience. Chess-Boxing is precisely the kind of thing that would draw a crowd (and the reason it isn't more popular is simply because there generally isn't any organized way to count on viewing it).  In fact, it would be beneficial to get in on establishing the popularity of something, rather than coming in on top of it. You can already watch poker on ESPN, so Twitch isn't offering something unique, by also broadcasting it.  In an environment where every other league of everything game related is broadcast (and rather huge), I can not imagine a world where an audience would not be nearly instantaneous the moment the front page of twitch has a live Chess-Boxing match. I mean, it's chess (a game). And boxing (a sport). It's practically built for a service like Twitch to capitalize on.  As an entrepreneur, I'll tell you that I don't ride the wave. I find the niches and ride them to greater popularity."
Twitch,3e16e8,BristolPalinsFetus,2,Tue Jul 21 05:08:45 2015 UTC,Hell yeah. Chess-Boxing on Twitch would be awesome. I would definitely watch it.
Twitch,3e16e8,Mattock79,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:18:33 2015 UTC,"As with all things Twitch... Poker is more popular, hence the increased chance to have viewers/ad views, hence more money for Twitch.   I have never heard of chess boxing until this post as I imagine is the case for your average Joe. So less likely people will watch, less ad views, less money.    So I suppose the answer to your original question is, ""probably never""."

Can you still have the xbox chat audio output to the speakers? You could do that on the 360.  As far as your diagram, I'm guessing a splitter could allow you to go from mic to controller/mixer, but you'll probably need several different cables, and I'm not sure how phantom power will act. I mean, in theory I suppose this would work, but it might introduce some lag."
Twitch,3e0f87,PeefHats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:46:30 2015 UTC,"The Xbox One doesn't have that function since the Xbox Live Party is a separate app and only outputs the audio from the other party members to your headset which is connected to the Xbox One controller. You'll have to do this to get it to work if you only want to use the Elgato HD60.   I'm mainly trying to be able to record Xbox Live Party Chat and only having to use one microphone for talking on Xbox Live and the Stream at the same time.   If I use for example a USB mic and route all my sounds to ""line in"" and ""mic"" on my computer I'll end up with having to have to use two microphones at the same time :/  EDIT: Would connecting a MIC that needs Phantom Power to something like this and then splitting the output of the adapter to the controller and the Sound Mixer work?"
Twitch,3e0f87,PeefHats,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:48 2015 UTC,"Ok, so here's what I've come with up:  First, get the CTIA splitter and plug it into the controller. Run the headphone to the mixer.  Next, take your XLR mic, and plug in an xlr splitter. Then from one of the ends, run it into a phantom power, then run that into your mixer. From the other end, run a xlr to 3.5"" cord into the mic in on the controller.  It's important to note that not all phantom power is equal and you need to be sure that your mic is getting the proper amount of power. For most condenser mics (the ones streamers like to use) this is 48v. Have you already bought any audio equipment?"
Twitch,3e0f87,PeefHats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:48:55 2015 UTC,"Alright, that sounds like it could work.   No I haven't bought anything yet. But will the ""Behringer Q502USB"" work with the input needs I have? (It does have 48v Phantom Power for Mics via Input 1.) And will connecting them to the mixer like this work?   From Streaming PC -> Input 2/3 From Xbox One Via Optical Adapter -> Input 3/4 From Xbox Controller - Headset Sound -> AUX IN"
Twitch,3e10r6,CLPockets,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:14:07 2015 UTC,"Best way to organize sound this way is to use an audio mixer.

If you want a cheaper solution then you could get a nice pair of 3.5 splitters, just be sure you get the right kind."

Some streamers use the word 'retard' a lot, but they don't use the word to actually discriminate against people"
Twitch,3dxof3,Ramautso,3,Mon Jul 20 12:07:04 2015 UTC,"I view and treat Twitch like the real world market- as businesses and brands. These people provide a service (entertainment), which we, as viewers, indulge. Saying ""faggot"" or ""retard"" on a stream would be like if Apple had ""Designed by Apple in Cupertino, California, Faggot"" on the back of every iphone. Is it allowed? Yeah. Is it their business and can they do anything with their products within legal bounds? Once again, yeah. Can the government (Twitch, in this analogy) really do anything? Maybe, but not really. They'd probably be sued (reporting, in this case), at which point, it just goes through the judicial process.  I think it would hurt their brand considerably and thus, they would kind-of phase out. When you start to offend people (and rightfully, they should be), it's the beginning of the end for your brand- you've lost their trust, thus their business (views).  I know this was about ""Whether or not you could use the words within the ToS of Twitch"", but you can't really have that answered correctly without touching upon ""whether or not you should use those words""."
Twitch,3dxof3,Beazleburbicus,5,Mon Jul 20 16:04:28 2015 UTC,"It is allowed but frowned upon. I've noticed a lot of non primary-English speaking streamers, especially on MOBAs, will call people ""retards and faggots"" all the time.

Twitch,3dxof3,ThisGuyBryan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"I don't remember reading anything about a specific word or words in the ToS when I last read it. However, if it's used repeatedly and someone wants to report for harassment, it would probably fall under those terms."
Twitch,3dxof3,DrShadyTree,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:51:33 2015 UTC,I'm sure it wouldn't be against ToS since there is no way Twitch could enforce it.

I don't mind swearing, or even someone messing around with friends and saying ""fuck you"" but once you start slurring, I'm not into it.

Twitch,3dzn6g,Theowl12,7,Mon Jul 20 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't stop streaming because of not growing. However, it did bother me that I only got a few viewers. The main problem I had was that I had spent so long on overlays, OBS, chat bots and so on, and people weren't really noticing. To be honest though, I look back and think it should never have bothered me.    But that wasn't the main reason I stopped. After a few streams, I soon found that it wasn't really what I wanted. I didn't have the environment or personality that a streamer needs, and I accepted that and decided that enough was enough. I have thought about going back and streaming so coding every now and them; but I never actually streamed. I am also concerned that people I am close to both online and in real life would find it. I didn't want that to happen.    As for what keeps me going on Twitch, where do I begin? People don't realise that there is a whole different side to Twitch when you don't stream. I decided to start helping out around the @TwitchSupport feeds, and ended up being picked up into the group of volunteers (which I didn't even know existed). Through that, I have come across so many brilliant people and streams. Continuing to help out in the community through writing guides, answering questions and so on makes Twitch a completely different experience. I only look forward to what comes up next..."

Twitch,3dzn6g,catdragonnamedrose,2,Tue Jul 21 07:42:30 2015 UTC,I've tried streaming and i don't really think I want to be super consistent because I really don't have a good environment to stream. I can't speak loudly and I don't have the greatest mic. I also would benefit from a decent webcam because I have a habit of making faces and moving my arms but I won't say much. I can try to talk as much as I want but like I said before I can't really speak up. I also don't have a good set up in general for streaming.

I haven't given up, but its def not something that is a priority at current time. I was growing just fine, but to be honest I am not even sure if streaming is for me. It is something I am good at from a technical standpoint, and people found me entertaining, and I loved it, but I just dunno if its what i really want to do within the twitch community.  Recently, I was made a global moderator, and with that I have had a bit of a refocus on where I would like my role within the community to go, which is mostly through supporting other users, helping solve problems, developing tools and stuff.   Streaming is fun, but it doesn't exercise my brain. the challenge just isn't there for me i guess haha.  That's the great thing with twitch. You can do a lot of things that can lead to a lot of different types of opportunities, there is sooo much more beyond ""streaming"" and I think that's pretty awesome."

But I'm on a prolonged break right now dealing with some real life stuff (work, medical issues, family).  I hope to jump into it on the regular (something I haven't been able to do yet) soon.    I love twitch.  I work from home mostly and I can watch twitch all day.  I find it more entertaining than day time TV.

If I was streaming every night with barely any viewers I feel like I would be down on myself a lot more often and that probably would have been the difference for me just giving up."
Twitch,3dzn6g,flexstar,3,Mon Jul 20 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"I had a baby :)  But in all honesty, sometimes life gets crazy and priorities change drastically. Streaming became a pretty trivial and potentially harmful part of my life when stacked next to getting ready for a baby, getting rest and exercise, and maintaining good mental health. It was a lot of fun for a while but I started having trouble finding enjoyable games and got stressed out, so I stopped because it wasn't as fun anymore and I had lots of real life stuff to focus on.  Fast forward four months and my life is much more in order now but I'm having difficulty making time for streaming. Fortunately my kid is on a pretty good sleep schedule now and goes to bed around 7:30 or 8, so now I have a designated time I know I'll be free, so I'm trying to pick everything back up again. I've had a lot more fun playing games I want to play instead of games I think people will want to watch me play.. and I think that's made me more watchable honestly haha.  tl;dr Sometimes real life stuff happens and sometimes things lose their fun. Good thing is, it doesn't stay that way forever!"

Twitch,3e0csc,gh0stingRS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much it, no charge back possible after that. But it's tricky tbh, sometimes banks don't care aboit your 6 months, the chargeback is happening no matter what."
Twitch,3e0csc,Aiekillu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:38:21 2015 UTC,I think the longest period of time in the past that AmEx charged something back for me was a few days over 3 years. I would just float it and not spend it unless you could afford to lose it.
Twitch,3e0csc,EDGAR_SEC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:32:09 2015 UTC,"Basically a card issuer has 180 days from the billing date to ""charge-back"" a transaction.  So once you are outside of that window, it's safer.  BUT, if it's via PayPal, well, good luck.  Read there Terms and Agreement.  They basically have the right to do whatever they want, but rule of thumb, you should be safe after that 6 months period generally speaking.  At least do what others suggest and keep that max amount available just in case an issue arrives."
Twitch,3e0csc,TheNinja_GuyDon,4,Tue Jul 21 06:03:56 2015 UTC,"Just leave the money in the account until the chargeback period is over, then the money is yours if its legit :)"
Twitch,3e0csc,CaptNikolai-08,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:36 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, when doing any type of business, the best way to protect yourself against charge backs is to keep a reserve of funds. Typically you will want to keep your highest donation amount in reserve and then build an emergency fund from there. Charge-backs are a nasty thing and you want to keep the mentality that its not your money until the card companies say so, because they can snatch it right back. http://www.dailyfinance.com/2012/07/31/credit-card-chargeback-merchant-disputes/  People abuse charge-backs and it is good to keep a record of all your donations just in case your processor is asking for evidence."
Twitch,3e0csc,be_lujan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:18:02 2015 UTC,Also with paypal I found some useful anti fruad functions like they will class multiply donations as fraud becuase if some donates $1 x 10 then charges them all back and you've taken the funds out youll be hit with a seperat fee for each $1 donation.
Twitch,3e0csc,CaptNikolai-08,2,Tue Jul 21 02:35:41 2015 UTC,"Each charge-back will cost $20.00 to the vendor(streamer) and a couple hundred dollars to PayPal. Each individual transaction needs to be disputed and if you lose you will get charged a charge-back fee. That fee is imposed by the card company (not by PayPal) for the transfer of funds, and cost of operations to dispute the case.   In the case of someone charging back multiple charges, their account will be flagged as buyer abuse - like you stated."
Twitch,3e0csc,be_lujan,3,Tue Jul 21 03:15:24 2015 UTC,"if you don't feel like you can wait 6 months, then immediately refund his/her money. You could be saving yourself a lot of trouble."

Twitch,3e0csc,scudpunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:57 2015 UTC,Because somebody who just comes into your stream and gives you $400 is most likely a troll and is waiting to fuck him with a chargeback. I doubt most people can hang on to that $400 without spending it.
Twitch,3e0csc,joocrazymang,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:56 2015 UTC,"Did you read the post? The dude comes into the stream a few times a week and is a somewhat regular viewer. It wasn't a completely random person. Also I think ""most likely a troll"" is an overstatement. Yeah its possible the donor was a troll but that's an awfully big amount of risk and effort for a troll to go through. and trolls fuck with people for a reaction, if they did do a charge back they wouldn't even get to see OP's reaction.  I think its more likely that this is a real donation, I've had like $1500 dollars donated to me since I started streaming and I've never dealt with a charge back. I think OP should hold onto the money."
Twitch,3e0csc,scudpunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:50 2015 UTC,"Let him send you an email with the paypal email adress stating that he gave you the money out of free will and that there was no sale transaction and or service expected. Just that you have a document that stats that you didnt sell anything to him and that he gave you the money because he wanted to like a tipp.  Dont touch the money for a while though. *edit * make sure you block donations from credit cards. i am not sure where to find that option but its there, somewhere."
Twitch,3dxhin,theupsman,9,Mon Jul 20 10:06:59 2015 UTC,"The best way is to remember that it's a community, not just a bunch of people who like watching you. Part of that is people who like hanging out with each other, so you need to make it as easy as possible for them to do so.  This is where a stream schedule comes in - when people know what times the clubhouse (your channel) is open (streaming), they're more likely to show up. They get to hang out with you, talk to each other, have time to build up in-jokes and all that other social stuff that people do.  Sounds like you're off to a great start. I'd consider sticking with the same or switching around similar games until you have a crowd of regulars. When you do change, let them know when you'll be playing [favourite game] again, so those who are mostly only interested in that game know when to come back."
Twitch,3dxhin,weefz,3,Mon Jul 20 10:46:20 2015 UTC,"This -  talk to them - find out what they're into - what games they like watching, and what they like about the way you play them - and make sure they know when you're going to be online."
Twitch,3dxhin,streambritish,2,Mon Jul 20 11:21:58 2015 UTC,"Schedule is definitely the best way to go! This and I found some streamers I watch have one day where they play a story game, so for example, every Tuesday night they will play a story game then other nights they'll play an online game or something else. As a viewer, I find that really cool, especially when they play story games I never got around to playing myself."
Twitch,3dxhin,gagsy92,3,Mon Jul 20 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"You can't force people to stay, only your attitude and how much people like your personality and you as a streamer will determine if viewers stick around from one game to the next.   The best thing that builds a community is time, it's a long road but with enough effort, time and care anyone with a good attitude and head on their shoulders can have a very solid community that will follow them regardless of what they are playing.  Anyone can get 500 viewers playing a popular new game, but it takes a true dedicated streamer to get 100 playing ""Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus""."

Twitch,3dxhin,AylaJayn,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:45 2015 UTC,"I wrote this in another post with a similar topic (sorry for the rehash):  Your stream is not the games you play, but you yourself. Start branching out. Yes, You'll lose viewers but also gain new ones. You don't want to be shoe-horned into a certain game (unless you do, in which case uhhhhh I dunno), it's the way, I found out, to disappoint both viewers who are use to you playing a certain game day-in; day-out and frankly, I never found playing the same game for so long to be all that fulfilling. If you want to be a streamer that provides a unique experience every time you push record, then just branching out is the most direct step. Good viewers are like good friends- They understand.  If you don't want to completely alienate a majority (or a part of) your audience, try to find games in the same vein as what you are currently playing. Then slowly branch yourself out. People don't like change, we're kinda wired for it. Compromise is usually an easier pill to swallow. Hope this helped and good luck to you!"

Twitch,3dxhin,Riposte_This,2,Mon Jul 20 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"I wish I could answer you my friend. I have been in the same boat as you. I was on an amazing spree a couple weeks back playing Rust. Didn't have less than 30 follows a night and was getting over 100 views per night as well. My concurrent viewers went from 20 to 80 gradually over a week as well and stayed consistent for a couple of days.  Then Rocket League came out. I started to play heavily and the first night I was still getting 40-50 or so, but only got a couple new followers (literally a couple). The past couple nights it has drastically reduced back down to 20-30 concurrent, which isn't worth complaining about but is quite a decrease.  I will say that the 20-30 there I absolutely adore. I recognize their names and know they are the dedicated ones. This is why I do giveaways for those in my channel with a certain point amount. They deserve it. I just wish I could find a way to pull in more views. You can't keep everyone forever, so even though you have a certain amount, you will need to continue bringing in more.  I guess my main advice here is if you play something, stick with it for a few weeks and see how it goes. Maybe you'll get a name for yourself. Get active in forums for the game and maybe people will check you out and tell their friends. That's a big maybe, not sure if it's worked for me yet. :("
Twitch,3dxhin,xyeLz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:53 2015 UTC,"If you become well known enough for playing your new game, then your loyal core will tell others who are interested in that game, and might even recommend you as a raid target for that new game, and from there your loyal core will increase, from people who were introduced to you via that new game who weren't interested in your previous game; then once your loyal core is large enough you can have an interesting chat even with games that almost nobody likes per se."
Twitch,3dxhin,lewisje,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"It's tough when you switch games b/c your viewer-base is built on the game you were playing, obviously.

Viewers who contribute to the channel get special VIP access to stuff on the SFX board and exclusive giveaways. Being a funny, likable character helps too. Good luck!"
Twitch,3dy5wx,Deadsens3,5,Mon Jul 20 14:24:48 2015 UTC,"There's a lot more to being a Twitch partner than just the quality options. Twitch recently increased the amount of transcodes that are available so that's why people who aren't partnered and average 25-60 viewers get quality options. Also just because someone is getting quality options doesn't mean that their chances for partnership are increased or even decreased. I'd say if you really think that you have something that Twitch would be interested in then apply. The worst that can happen is that you get denied, but you can always reply to the denial e-mail and ask what you can improve on, etc."
Twitch,3dy5wx,conceptional,2,Mon Jul 20 14:36:04 2015 UTC,40-50 might be a little too low for partnership. It honestly doesn't hurt to try though.

Twitch,3dxy7q,vroman1989,9,Mon Jul 20 13:19:09 2015 UTC,"I generally find having a YouTube channel that consists solely of your Twitch exports to be kind of lazy. The way I see it, YouTube is the place for offline edited videos, and Twitch is the place for live unedited interaction. When you try to ""double up"" it just sort of comes off as lazy, unless you very clearly list your YouTube channel as an ""archive channel"" or something like that whose sole purpose is making sure your VODS last forever.  A good way to combine the two is to have edited highlights on your YouTube channel that link back to your Twitch. That way, it's clear you're not just trying to double up on views but you're still utilizing both services in a cool way."

Twitch,3dxy7q,Brawli55,5,Mon Jul 20 13:48:31 2015 UTC,"(Warning this post contains links to our YouTube channel as a means of demonstration - if the mods feel this is inappropriate let me know)  We don't produce new content for YouTube, but the benefits of having an active YouTube presence is a no brainer.  If you're just uploading old content to your YouTube it isn't that difficult to get into a flow. You just need to be consistent. I try to upload at least one thing a day. This usually consists of a 1 hour chunk of a past stream (usually ones no longer available via Twitch's VOD service) or a 1-5 min highlight.   Here's our channel to get an idea of the daily content we put in ours: http://www.youtube.com/user/OverBoredGaming  People have been really enjoying our YouTube as a place to consume our content when we're not live.  Since adopting a ""something"" a day upload we've seen an increase in activity on our YouTube. It's a great place for exposure and down the road maybe revenue too.  I upload entire streams. I just do it one hour at a time. That's mostly due to YouTube's limitations of 2-hour long videos (our streams generally last 4 hours) and me not wanting to encode videos over an hour long in Adobe Premiere (I have to do some video editing to stitch the 30 min chunks together, sync audio, etc).  In order to organize it - I set each stream as a separate playlist.  1. EXAMPLE - Stream Playlist  I also have a list of all stream playlists.  2. EXAMPLE - Stream Playlist List  Once a game is complete I'll compile the parts into a full playthrough playlist.  3. EXAMPLE - Full Playthrough Playlist  And finally, I have a list of all full playthrough playlists.  4. EXAMPLE - Full Playthrough Playlists list  What's cool is since every stream makes at least 4 separate uploads, as long as the stream keeps on going I'll always have content for YouTube!  I tried doing 15 minute segments but that was cumbersome to produce, and viewers have said they prefer the hour long uploads."

Twitch,3dxy7q,Mugros,2,Tue Jul 21 11:44:49 2015 UTC,"Twitch is a platform of raw content; Youtube, on the other hand, is a platform that requires more polished and focused content.   You can stream for 6-8 hours on Twitch, but an 6-8 hour Youtube video is unthinkable. You're best bet is to either break down your streams into digestible and polished pieces (by use of editing and no down time or dead air, etc) or create a Youtube only ""show"", if you will.   Thats the beauty of Twitch is that you get a raw experience, emotions are genuine, it is rarely acting, forced or fake. Youtube is more strategic and calculated, which could be associated with a forced feel (not always, by any stretch), but it also means a more quality experience, as a whole- a concise piece of satisfying entertainment. Different platforms require different content, to bluntly put it.  So my suggestion? Start thinking about doing something new- something different for Youtube. A show or series (along side with highlights video, which are gaining a lot of steam) that is unique to Youtube so:  A) People on twitch who enjoy your streams could also be funneled to something new and interesting on Youtube.  B) The opposite- People on Youtube could be exposed to you as a personality and then simply let curiosity do the rest  C) You are building a personal brand, neither defined by Youtube or Twitch, which is a very important thing. This will help to avoid being just another flash in pan, but a main stay success for years to come.  Of course I'm basing this all off of years of watching Twitch stream and Youtube videos, my own streaming and videos, following/subscribing patterns, etc. I'm am also basing this off my job of helping brands rank higher on search engines (SEO). Unique content is key on Google and, subsequently, The Internet, as a whole. It is not a guarantee. At any rate, I hope the best for you and Good Luck!"

Streaming requires constant interaction, but who's going to watch you talking to a million people when they have no idea what they said (unless you have active chat on stream, which I think takes away from the stream).  I wish there was a way to remove the webcam from your stream specifically for YouTube. This would make it very easy to redo the commentary and add effects, which would allow us to use the same video.  Anywho, I'd call them both separate entities. I'd upload highlights from time to time just for hilarity, but other than that I'd make YouTube videos separate if you wanted to become a YouTuber."
Twitch,3dxy7q,murderbits,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:57:24 2015 UTC,"There's no harm in putting your streams up there.  If you do, I'd advise considering the way I'm doing it.   Maintain a separate and ordered playlist for your Live Streams. Provide a better video quality than your Twitch stream. (While my GTAV stream had to be within 2.5Mbps to accommodate Twitch, my local encode was 6.5Mbps - and when I go with a dedicated streaming/encoding rig, I could easily do a 20Mbps 1080@60fps stream, etc). Brand it clearly and separately. My thumbnails are very identifiable and make it clear that they're from a live stream. Disable ""notify subscribers of update"" so these uploads don't cause spam to your Youtube subscribers.   I primarily use Youtube  as a backup archive of slightly better quality encoded versions as well as a place people could go view older videos that are no longer retained on Twitch. These videos are not intended as ""the primary content"" for the Youtube channel. But since they exist and since archiving them on Youtube serves a purpose, there's no reason not to.  If you're looking to make something of your Youtube channel, then also make exclusive better quality content for it, too. If you're just looking for a place to dump your archives for your own reference and so others can find them whenever they want, then you probably don't care about ""making something of the channel"", so it doesn't really matter, as long as it fills your ""archiving"" need.  Of course, don't count on it as your only backup. It's just an ""availability"" backup. You are not backed up unless you have three versions of a file - at least one of them in a separate location."

However, you can definitely stream with less and people won't really care.  This is somewhat game dependent, and will work far better with a minimalistic indie title than it will with a a fast-paced FPS.  Myself, I was partnered streaming at ~550kbps, 540p, 20fps streaming titles like FTL and Spelunky, which lose very little from the lower quality.  Since then I've been able to upgrade my Internet and CPU - both of which were required to up the stream quality - but it mattered a lot less than one might think for me starting out."

Living alone advice: Clean for 10 minutes every day. Be vigilant. Do laundry weekly. This will help you keep your life together.  Plan on streaming every day: regular 5 - 10 minute stretch sessions(can even make it part of your stream, like ""HEY GUYS!! TIME TO STRETCH!!!"". I've seen people do this with water breaks). Also drink water. Also also, plan things outside of streaming to get out and see daylight. A good reason to bond with the lady as well. Happy wife happy life and all that. But definitely have time set aside to unplug, see sun, take care of yourself, cook healthy food, exercise, experience something in the area, even if it's just sitting in the park reading for half an hour. Also brings up food, don't eat junk food, don't drink soda. Treat your body well and it will hold up to those long regular stream hours better. One last thing: have at least 1 day off a week. This comes back to the fact that the biggest reason people fail out is not being dedicated for some reason or another, and not treating yourself well is a bad reason to fail."
Twitch,3dz3gl,ollee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:40:39 2015 UTC,"Definitely at least 5 upload speed, and more never hurts. I recently upgraded to 100 down/10 up and it's AMAZING.  You may get complaints if you stream late at night, during the day most people aren't home or may not mind as much. It never hurts to introduce yourself and bring it up in conversation. Also make sure you use headphones if you aren't already, speaker bass can vibrate through walls/floors easily.  Set yourself a dedicated schedule and stick to it, making sure to give yourself one or two days off. Get plenty of rest and make sure to take 10-15 minute breaks (you could even include a handy countdown timer on stream for this).   And pay attention to your girl! My wife is super supportive of everything I do but that doesn't mean she wants to come in second place to it! I wish you the best of luck on your new life!"
Twitch,3dz3gl,Td4rk0n3,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:58:55 2015 UTC,I can answer the first one. I would say at least 30 down and 10 up
Twitch,3dz3gl,LBPRacers,3,Mon Jul 20 18:32:27 2015 UTC,30 up and 10 down? Internet speeds are structured that you're more likely to find 30 down and 10 up.

Twitch,3dz2sa,tagsrdumb,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:20 2015 UTC,Verified twitter accounts? Verified email account's only in your chat. Only accept accounts that are older than X days old. Base the giveaways on a point system bot that rewards activity? Few idea.s
Twitch,3dz2sa,ollee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:52 2015 UTC,Verified twitter accounts? Verified email account's only in your chat.   Would you mind expanding on this? How do I set it to only allow verified accounts in my chat?
Twitch,3dz2sa,ollee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:45:12 2015 UTC,Under the channel & video tab of your settings there is a check box to only allow verified email accounts to chat in your chat: http://i.imgur.com/jizK6LO.png
Twitch,3dz2sa,CrisuKomie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:34 2015 UTC,Verified accounts are nice... by please be aware you can register multiple usernames to one email.  I currently have 2 registered to my email... my main account and a test account.  I know people that have upwards of 10 accounts for 1 email address.
Twitch,3dz2sa,CrisuKomie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:50 2015 UTC,"So I need to go the verified twitter account route then? I feel like a point system could still be exploited. The one i looked at gave points for time present, like 1 point per 15 minutes, and 1 point for time active.  That would still allow someone to park an account for an extended period of time and gain points. I need a solid way around these cheaters if Im going to throw hundreds of dollars into stream growth I dont want it to be the same 5 guys just making multiple accounts."
Twitch,3dz2sa,HammerIsMyName,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:11:21 2015 UTC,In all honesty... there's really not much you can do. Its pretty easy for someone to make multiple Twitter accounts as well.  For example.. I have 3 email accounts... one for business... one for personal... and one for twitch.  Pretty much all you can do is accept thst there will be cheaters and just hope you catch them before you give them the prize.
Twitch,3dz2sa,HammerIsMyName,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"Most giveaway bot functionality shows you how old the account is - You can take it a step further and look at who the account follows. But there's no way to get around it, and it would truly suck to disregard someone who JUST made their account to be part of your giveaway just because you think it might be a fraud attempt.  My giveaways are fairly simple. People must follow the channel and they must be present in chat. That's it.  I do so many giveaways that it doesn't even matter if someone is cheating or someone wins twice (I've had 2 viewers win twice already) - I giveaway 6 items on average every time I do a giveaway so there are plenty of chances to win for everyone."
Twitch,3dz2sa,drewlinskii,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:26:01 2015 UTC,"So basically get over it. if someone wants to tilt the scales they can, all I can do it take the steps that have been offered here and understand that someone may still slip around it.

There are mature filters that can be enabled on channel pages for those streamers or games that are a bit too graphic/violent, that's as much as should be needed. If you want a totally wild and unmoderated livestreaming platform, then I'm sure there are other services out there :)"
Twitch,3dzssl,NerdyChinaMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:32:12 2015 UTC,I agree - Twitch's theme is people connecting with a community while playing games. An adult section seems to be for those that are looking for more than a friendly connection with their viewers.

Twitch,3dzqc6,catdragonnamedrose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:35:12 2015 UTC,"having a facecam can help you seem more animated than if you were just a voice. If you choose to not facecam, make sure that you sound animated."
Twitch,3dzqc6,Brombeere,0,Mon Jul 20 21:13:32 2015 UTC,Wich is quite hard. Especialy on very hot days for example.
Twitch,3dzqc6,Brawli55,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:10 2015 UTC,"Can you stream without one? Most assuredly. Should you feel pressured to use one if you have an anxiety about it? Nope. Do what feels most comfortable for you.  That said, streaming is an interactive medium. When you host your show you have  access to a chat that allows for instant communication for the host and the viewer. What better emulates a real world conversation between two human beings - one where people can see each others faces or one where you cannot see each other faces? Now, since the host can't have a feed of every single viewer, the real life reactions of the show is on the part of the host, the person the viewers are talking to.  I don't know about you, but as a viewer I am much more likely to connect with a host if I can see them. I can gauge their body language and see if it matches up with their voice; I have a better window into their personality that I would otherwise have no access to if they were just a voice. Overall, I am willing to say that this simply isn't just a preference that I have, but is the default mode of communication most humans prefer. Thus, webcams are a popular tool and overall are more likely to provide an advantage over those that don't use them.  Overall though, preference is king. If you are an individual that doesn't like webcams - there are streams to watch that don't include them. Twitch's breadth of streamers is huge.   If as a streamer, and more importantly as a person you have an anxiety about using a cam, a troubling notion in your brain that worries at the thought of people being able to see you and you not them, then I wouldn't use one.   No one is saying not using a cam is wrong, perhaps just not as optimal."
Twitch,3dzqc6,RSVJ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:39:01 2015 UTC,"Look at Lirik, look at VaderRP.  They don't use facecam.  They seem to be doing just fine.  I wouldn't see it as a requirement, but there are some people (close minded, mind you) out there that won't look at your stream without one.    But these two are very ""animated"" and funny as hell to watch.  Just keep that in mind if you want to keep the viewers that do show up."
Twitch,3dzqc6,ekuskrash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:08 2015 UTC,Those are two well established streamers. They have great quality stream and content wise. People use them too often as an example when they are actually the exception. :)
Twitch,3dzqc6,Darktire,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"All large streamers are the exception though.  It isn't the norm to get to their size regardless of facecam.  There are plenty of other successful non facecam using broadcasters though, it all depends on the person/content more so than use of cam."
Twitch,3dzqc6,ekuskrash,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:35:09 2015 UTC,"I personaly enjoy having a camera for my stream because I communicate a lot with facial expressions, thats just the kind of person I am. Cam or no Cam if the content is good, people will stay."
Twitch,3dzqc6,Darktire,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:48:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, I use a cam as well for those reasons, but if using a cam makes you uncomfortable it's probably better to just not use it"
Twitch,3dzqc6,FMAlcoholist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:51:27 2015 UTC,"Not at all. When it comes to the viewer it's a complete preference thing. Some people want it, some don't, most probably don't care as long as the caster is entertaining to listen to.   The best advice I've heard from successful streamers is probably just to be consistent. Both with your streaming schedule and the games you play."

Twitch,3dzqc6,Brombeere,0,Mon Jul 20 22:14:22 2015 UTC,It will make it harder to grow. People will grow more fond of you seeing your face and also sometimes without people seing your expressions they might missunderstand you.

Twitch,3dzqc6,snowlit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:09:28 2015 UTC,"Not having a facecam is not a deal breaker, but like many in this thread have already said, it does mean you have to put a bit more effort in. Viewers not being able to see your face or reactions means one less way for them to interact with you, and all they really have is your voice then. That said, it's entirely possible to see success without a facecam. I managed to build a community quickly, got partnership a little over 2 months of streaming, all without ever having used a facecam. So it's what you end up doing to make your stream stand out and worth watching and listening to. Facecams may help but definitely not a dealbreaker if you don't have one. :)"

Twitch,3dyojm,Nerosix,2,Mon Jul 20 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/Nerosix,  Here are the recommended specifications for a PC that is gaming/streaming or simply a streaming PC, or if you simply want to upgrade a part.   Each section will go a little bit into detail about why each component is important.     CPU:  You will want to go with the best CPU you can. Ideally that is where most of your PC build budget is spent. Due to how streaming works, the CPU is the most important part.   General recommendations for CPU's:    Any of the following or newer Intel Core i7 CPU's, with better ones in descending order.  Core i7 2600k Core i7 3770k Core i7 4770k Core i7 4790k Core i7 5820k Core i7 5930k Core i7 5960x   AMD CPU's are not recommended for streaming as they have very low IPC(Instructions-per-clock) performance. A top-of-the-line AMD 8350 CPU will perform as well or maybe worse as a i7 2600k, a 4 year old Intel CPU.     Ram:  Ram is not very important when streaming. Typically, when using a program like OBS, no more than 500MB will be used. Of course, this may very depending on the amount of source, plugins etc.   General recommendation for ram:    8GB DDR3 or higher     GPU: The GPU is the next most essential part of streaming. Popular programs like OBS, Xsplit and others perform actions on the GPU, like compositing, which is when the game video, webcam video, overlays, etc are all mixed into one picture, and scaling, which when your stream is converted from 1080p to 720p. Other actions include anti-alising, which can be applied after scaling to increase the quality, and other effects.   General recommendation for GPU:    Nvidia - Any GTX 650 series or higher (700, 900)  AMD - Any Radeon 6850 series or higher (7000, R7, R9)     Thats pretty much it. Other parts like the case, power supply, and hard drive is up to you, as they do not make a huge difference. If you will be doing lots of recordings and/or recording your streams, a 2TB or 4TB HDD would be beneficial to your build.   Cheers,  -Royal"
Twitch,3dyojm,LtRoyalShrimp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:34 2015 UTC,Hi there!  Thats one hellova list!  Afraid the cheapest i7 you get these days costs about 2-3 times what I have to play with each month. But I got my 955 (not 965) working! And I have the GTX 560 Ti (Twin Frozr 2) which works pretty well. I am going for a new RAM chip I think:)
Twitch,3dyojm,chhopsky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:27:59 2015 UTC,"TBH, any modern CPU from medium to high end is going to be fine.  I wouldn't overthink it too much!  As someone who used to be a student though, I would say to think about how long you need this CPU to last.  Overclocking may be free speed but it does lower CPU life.  ""Here for a good time not a long time"" etc.  If you can afford to replace it in 2-3 years, awesome.  If not, leave it stock.  I'm not up on current AMD lineup so I can't be specific with those, but I would be extremely surprised if anything mid-high couldn't handle it with ease."
Twitch,3dyojm,thechet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:24 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that if you want to change CPUs you will probably need to get a new mother board too. You are most likely going to see the most improvement from getting a better cpu or an internal capture card. IF you plan to overclock you will want a good after market heat sync or it wont be worth it anyway. if it is working fine for you right now, just put the money you were willing to spend to the side and save up till you can get a real upgrade."
Twitch,3dyojm,DiamondRyce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:51:13 2015 UTC,Is an i5 an option? depends on the motherboard that the G550 is running.   Ram is always ideal for streaming but 8GB should be considered after swapping out that celeron cpu.   My advice is to not buy the g3258 if you are going to be playing and streaming pc games at the same time.  Also if you can get 965 stable with that new ram then that would be the best option as it is the most cost effective and should handle your new 720p capture card.
Twitch,3dyojm,DiamondRyce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:57:23 2015 UTC,i5 costs a lot more than I'd like... But i managed to get the 955 (not 965 as i wrote) working again! And it works like a charm:D Thanx for the reply!
Twitch,3dyojm,ollee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:23:19 2015 UTC,I take it that the ram worked then. 955 is nice and still overclockable. At this rate more ram and your new capture card should be okay then.
Twitch,3dy3yc,painstorm506,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:09 2015 UTC,Oddly enough I had a few viewers also complain about buffering issues during my stream - and there was nothing wrong at all on my end.
Twitch,3dy3yc,Growlibi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:04:47 2015 UTC,Well I thought it was just a user band with issue. Like they were on mobile or something.  But it even happens to me viewing his stream on my laptop with nothing else connected.  I go and purposefully watch other streams from top partners to someone with 2 viewers just to see and they run fine but his just locks up.
Twitch,3dy3yc,Growlibi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:28 2015 UTC,I'm shooting in the dark here but I think it might have to do with Twitch giving encoding options to smaller channels to compete with youtube.  But I'm very uninformed on this subject I have to say.
Twitch,3dy3yc,Osiris-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:59 2015 UTC,Buffering is never a problem on your end if you are not dropping frames.
Twitch,3dy3yc,gagsy92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:47:55 2015 UTC,"A streamer I watch has this problem as well. It sounds similar but from a viewers point, the stream goes to 'loading video' then repeats the last 7 seconds or so, it then hits another 'loading video' screen and repeats until eventually the stream video fails to load.   Eventually it comes back online after a minute or 2 but it seems to happen quite frequently."
Twitch,3dy3yc,gagsy92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"exactly, or it has the spinning circle in the middle for 30+ sec.  But if you refresh the page boom loads right up.  It's weird."
Twitch,3dy3yc,chhopsky,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's definitely something on Twitch's end. The guy I watch has great internet (which I'm jealous of) and streams through the PS4 broadcasting, so we figured either PSN was messed up and causing it or it's something to do with Twitch."
Twitch,3dy3yc,gagsy92,2,Mon Jul 20 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to tell.  The internet isn't just 'the internet' as such, you can have great bandwidth to some sites and terrible bandwidth to others.  All that having 100/100 means is that it's a maximum you can achieve, as that's the choke point at your end.  99% of the time when we (or any other service) see problems like this, it's somewhere between the users ISP and us, and is out of our control.  These issues can be solved by ISPs joining a public peering exchange that we're on, and/or directly peering with Twitch.  It may be worth petitionining them to do that.  If this is something you're interested in, tell them you want them to peer with AS46489."

Twitch,3dyf7s,vroman1989,2,Mon Jul 20 15:35:00 2015 UTC,I recommend having a look at the Twitter section on this guide. That should give you a few tips on using social media.
Twitch,3dyf7s,Heep123,2,Mon Jul 20 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"I'm an SEO, by trade. So social media managing and brand building through these platforms kinda comes with the territory, as well. I am of the school of thought that traditional social media is dying. slowly, but surely. In favor of your more abstract and visually-appealing social networks- namely Instagram and Snapchat (Vine kinda too, but not really, unless you got a really good angle). Twitter and Facebook are pretty terrible for brand building because you aren't getting out there without paying for ad space. They should be used to engage an already established fanbase.   Instagram is an interesting, yet somewhat, accessible choice that I don't see a lot of streamers use effectively (probably as it requires more work making nice, appealing art, optimizing posts yadda yadda, but anyway). People are more likely to find you on Instagram, simply by using hashtags of course. The audience on Instagram is more curious- they tend to use the discover feature a lot more than most other social media, such as Twitter, where they tend to just read what is posted by the people they are following and rarely branch out. Facebook is even more tight-knit, both by design (Facebook algorithms to ensure businesses pay for ads) and the fact that users prefer people over businesses/brands.  Snapchat would be a perfect choice for the ""guerrilla advertising"" angle, but once again, it has it's risks and rewards and using it effectively means thinking outside the box a little bit- people need to add you first, but advertising it on your stream/website and not long before you would have, at least, a few curious parties.  My ultimate suggestion would be to make a website, a hub. A place people can go to get all the info they want (which will, hopefully, lead them to your streams and social media, thus building your brand). SEO is basically the process of getting ranked on Google (and other search engines) through content, backlinks, and optimization. Anyone can do it, but it does require some research, and it can have major benefits to you not only as a streamer, but also as a Internet personality, as a whole. A optimized website can get you ranked on page 1 of Google for something like ""Twitch Stream Counter Strike"" or something of the sort (requires a lot of research and optimization, but still completely doable) and that would give you exponentially more curious parties.  However, if you adamant about brand-building on Twitter, optimization is about the only way (along with shoutouts from other, more famous accounts or ads, which I would not recommend for anybody- business or otherwise) to ensure you've done everything you could. Utilizing logical keywords (twitch, stream, lets play, [insert game title here] and hashtags in posts. Using images is a huge plus as it gets people's attention (though Twitter isn't very image friendly either).  I know that was a bit of a lecture, I apologize for the long-windedness (and probable grammar mistakes) of that all. Hope this helps and good luck to you!  Edit: Words."
Twitch,3dyf7s,Beazleburbicus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:32 2015 UTC,"Twitter is more of a way to keep in touch with the viewers you already have, not a way to get new ones. I can't imagine many people browse hashtags for streams when they can just browse streams directly."

Twitch,3dyf7s,conceptional,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"True, if you have a someone with a large following who follows you already though. People with huge followings aren't just sitting there browsing stream hashtags."
Twitch,3dyf7s,DamnNoHtml,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:32 2015 UTC,"(not really saying this to you specifically, but to whoever might be discouraged by this)  While it is true that it's hard to get new viewers with Twitter, by no means should that discourage people from using it! Social media can be a great way to further engage your audience, and (as a result) develop both a personal connection and an overall community with it.  No matter how much you might push for greater exposure, you and your social media accounts are a single vector. It is up to other individuals to spread your word around, and there's no better group to do that than your current fans, who can become evangelists for your content. Treat your old fans right, and they'll help bring in the new ones."

Twitch,3dyf7s,Nehssa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:10:50 2015 UTC,"The trouble is, most of these spam accounts are followed exclusively by two groups.  A) People who are desperate to get their own name out there, and aren't necessarily into discovering other talent  and  B) Other spam accounts.  The biggest issue is that people don't trust these sorts of accounts to provide them with quality entertainment. Even if they tweet out entirely enjoyable streams, the average user knows that literally anyone can get a shout-out from them, and as a result, they lose all accountability."

Twitch,3dxna1,unrulytriangles,4,Mon Jul 20 11:27:48 2015 UTC,"Copy pastasing a post I wrote a few months ago about this topic - I think you will find it interesting.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2rjtym/an_honest_and_optimistic_discussion_about_channel/?sort=top  If you have spent any time here on /r/Twitch then you've seen many, many posts asking the question, ""is my channel growth good?"" then the OP proceeds to detail how long they have been streaming and what their current follow and concurrent viewers counts are.  The common thread in all these threads is the general response is that there is no general response to these kinds of question. I firmly believe that everyone's stream will grow at vastly different rates for vastly different reasons. Time slots, games chosen, networking, luck are just a few of the factors that will come into play when trying to parse out the growth of any single individual channel.  So what's the point of this post, you ask? This isn't a reinforcement of the ideas above, but more so my thoughts on a kind of ""goal"" all streamers can aim for when it comes to any form of ""expected"" growth.   It all breaks down to converting one true fan a week.  For anyone familiar with the 1,000 True Fan Theory (Found here) this might ring a bell. At its core the 1,000 True Fan theory states that an artistic endeavor can be supported if there are at the very least 1,000 people who are life-long fans.   Obviously the validity of the 1,000 True Fan Theory can be disputed, and the author agrees, but I believe there is some basis for it and the pursuit of those ""1,000 Tue Fans"" led me to a realization about stream growth that put all my efforts into perspective.  You'll get to a point  when you realize how ""worthless"" the follower count truly is. Don't get me wrong, having a high follower count most certainly has its perks, but overall it does very little to serve as a gauge of how you are doing as a streamer. Our stream has almost 15k followers, but at best we'll get viewer counts ranging from 120-250 (game depending).  That means we are getting a little over 1% of our follower count in terms of concurrent viewers. What I would give for  a consistent 2% or dare I even dream, 3%. From what I've seen of streamers of similar size - this is a common ratio. It's because a follow is the easiest thing a Twitch viewer can ""give"" to a streamer. There is no consequence to a viewer throwing a follow to a stream they will never go to again, even more so if the account was made for a giveaway; if you are a streamer that advertises frequent giveaways expect an even greater threshold between follows and concurrent viewers.  The overall point of above is to emphasize that your focus should always be on the viewers you have in your stream right now and not the top end viewer count you could theoretically get if every single person who ever followed you were to just come back (it's never going to happen).  This is why as a streamer I focus on converting viewers into True Fans and from what I've seen if you can convert one True Fan a week then you have a shot at making it as a streamer.  That said, keep in mind this isn't a get famous quick strategy. There are 52 weeks in a year and if you manage in one year of streaming to convert a true fan a week then you have 52 viewers who will stick with you. In terms of ""making it"" as a streamer you are still way off in terms of financial stability. As others have mentioned on the subreddit - streaming isn't a sprint it's a marathon. You have to be in it for the long haul - because you love it.  52 True Fans in one year is, I feel, a very conservative estimate. And keep in mind your first year will be difficult since the lower amount of exposure you have the harder it is to convert people. You might go a few weeks where you don't convert anyone, and then you might hit a week where you convert tens of people. As is with TwitchTV, growth is exponential and things come easier the more people are present in your stream. Keep them around and start to disregard your follower count entirely.  Let's take our stream for example, OverBored Gaming. Come February 25th we'll have been streaming for 2 years. I imagine our follower count might be around 15,500 then and our common concurrent viewer counts will still be around 120-250 (I was 100% correct in my prediction!). We've had the opportunity to convert 104 true fans in the past 2 years of streaming, and by going subs and concurrent viewers I feel we're more or less on track with my estimates.   Don't get me wrong - it's hard work to impress another human being enough to want to spend their time with you everyday, especially people as discriminating in tastes as internet users. But it's possible - it really is.   I just wanted to provide some semblance of metrics for you to follow, something to help you feel like you aren't totally in the dark when it comes to trying to measure if your growth is ""good.""  What I'm trying to say is your growth doesn't suck quite as much as you think it does :)"

You'll get excited when your viewercount/followers rise, but eventually it may decline and you may lose followers too.  For me, for the first three months of streaming I gradually grew until hitting about 30 viewers on average, and since March or so, it's gradually declined on average so I'm back down to about 12.  Follower/viewer count depends mainly on the game."

I'm no doctor but I'm sure I'm not the only one to say that I don't think being a ""big time streamer"" is your issue. Your underlying obsessive compulsive is your issue. The way I interpreted your post is that regardless of this was streaming, or anything else you're passionate about, you would still have this issue of obsession. Its a shame that you only realized this after reaching your goals, however that's not to say you're doomed. I seriously recommend you see a professional and talk to him/her about this issue and try to find something that works for you, both financially and emotionally. It's 110% possible to balance this. Good luck friend.   Apologies for no formatting, on mobile"
Twitch,3dvyfi,ComradeAlec,22,Mon Jul 20 08:56:45 2015 UTC,"Hey dude,   Maybe you need some advice. I'm not the biggest streamer in the world but I took a read at your post and I'll mention a few things.   I got to and am at the point where I am addicted to my view count.   You should never be addicted to your view count. The biggest lesson any successful streamer will tell you is to ignore it and only focus on your community and chat. That is the most important thing.    Everything, down to what I eat, when I sleep, when I wake, What I do that day, evolves around my stream.   I think most streamers who are daily broadcasters (like myself) can relate to this. This difference is a lot of us get enjoyment out of this. Most understand the sacrifices and the difficulty maintaining relationships. I only have a few close friends that I see once a week or less. I talk to them about what I am trying to do and how devouring and time consuming is. They support me.   Making my depression even worse as I get so high and reach a whole new low. Which lead to my alcohol addiction to feel better about how crap I felt, This is also something I have noticed with a lot of streamers in the same situation as me, an alcohol addiction   I would suggest trying to break that habit. Instead of having a beer at night go outside for a walk. Try to find new hobbies to break up your day and get help. Maybe consider speaking to a physiatrist.    I stopped leaving my desk, I only wanted to get better at the game I played, I never left my room, stopped talking to my friends and put on an abundance of weight. I never want to take a day off, of fear of losing my followers and regular viewers.   Also relatable. This isn't really an active ""job"". Again I'd suggest working out before or after your stream to break up your day. Most daily streamers are also very active offline.    I just want to warn people to not make the mistake I did and get wound up and focus my entire life on views.   Building a community isn't easy on Twitch. It's one of the hardest things to do in online media. Stress is a big killer man. Maybe streaming just isn't what you truly want to do with your life. If you wake up every single morning hating what you do - start focusing on changing what is causing you to become stressed.  I decided to start streaming full-time to leave my stress filled sales job. I worked and streamed every single day for over a year and I just decided to take some time off to focus on building my streaming community. Every day I wake up excited to broadcast and I do spend almost every single additional hour either communicating with other streamers or finding ways to make a better viewer experience. It's consuming and isn't for everyone.  TLDR; Get some help. Speak to a career counselor and psychiatrist to help you with your depression. Start getting some exercise in. Not exercising is one of the leading causes of depression. Stop excessing over your view counter and instead only focus on your community and chatters. Ask yourself if its worth it and is this really want you want to do with your life. It may not be and take some time away to discover who you are as a person.   There is more to life then Twitch and broadcasting. Get out there and discover it."
Twitch,3dvyfi,deadlyslob,4,Mon Jul 20 00:25:40 2015 UTC,"Streaming is not a great way to make a living. You simply cannot live, what most would consider, a decent quality of life. You have no benefits, little vacation time, poor work/life balance, unsteady income, you're building little to no work experience,  relationships are harder to maintain and the list goes on. I'm not trying to rub it in but it's a reality if you're trying to make streaming a living. My suggestion is this, scale back for a little while and possibly get a part-time job. Focus on adding some physical activity into your routine, run or work out a bit. You'd be surprised what even a little physical activity can do for you mentally. If you find yourself missing streaming a lot, by all means, go back to it full time. I would just make sure it's what you really want and is worth the stress that it's bringing to your life.    I work hard at what I do for a living and sometimes it takes me away from home but I am compensated for it. I do not see that happening for the big streamers. Gaming is a lot of fun and so is interacting with viewers but turning that into a job is a great way to ruin your hobby. It takes a very particular type of person to make it work and swallow the hardships that come with it."
Twitch,3dvyfi,unph4zed,4,Mon Jul 20 08:34:48 2015 UTC,"Your very first mistake was doing it to beat ""your competitors"" and working for your ""dream job""."
Twitch,3dvyfi,IAmTriscuit,3,Mon Jul 20 04:53:07 2015 UTC,"I too am above the 3000 top followed channels, am partnered, and doing it fulltime.  And this is my honest advice, you need to do something about this mentality. And fast. Everything about this is unhealthy. I usually stream well over 60 + hours a week, and have gone to having 150-200 viewer averages, to as little as getting 20 viewers a stream (even at over 15k + followers.) so I understand everything you mean.   Obsessing over view counts, ditching friends, and ditching life in general is awful. If your stream is that overwhelming it's causing you this much emotional discomfort, you need to take a break. It's NOT healthy to be that emotionally effected by your stream. Now, I say this as someone who has worried about this too.   Sometimes you have an awful stream and you feel like shit the rest of your day. 6 hours of awesome content and barely any new followers, or donations, or subs, or anything. It fucking sucks. I understand. As well as nothing compares to the high of triple your normal viewers, sub trains, and stream record donations. But, realize that while streaming is important it's NOT your life.  But, of course some people are full time streamers... which leads to this. If you're barely making enough money to live off of streaming, you need another out. Find another job and take less hours streaming. Streaming doesn't work out for everyone, and I've seen streamers with good view counts not even be able to pay bills (from low donations / subs). Life comes first. Never forget that.  Also, don't forget streaming should be for fun. That's cliche as fuck but I wouldn't be doing 13 hour streams back to back if it wasn't fun. If you're stressing about things, you need to remember that. It's about having fun and making other people with similar interests feel great too.   Though this is a pretty preachy post, and I'm sure you'll hate to hear this. I do understand loads of streamer woes, so if you ever need someone feel free to pop me a PM. Life gets stressin', and sometimes a good bitch is always good.  I hope whatever you try to do goes well, and good luck with your future broadcasts!"

Twitch,3dvyfi,trippychrissy,3,Mon Jul 20 03:09:24 2015 UTC,"Some ideas (As a viewer, I would love to watch these).   Go out and play Ingres or any other real-world-exploration games, livestream it with GoPro camera or something. Invite friends and/or family members to a poker or any other card games, livestream it. Go out and challenge strangers on the street in a game of chess, livestream it. Go to arcade center and challenge random strangers, livestream it."
Twitch,3dvyfi,MarioTinton,3,Mon Jul 20 00:41:51 2015 UTC,Although you bring up great ideas - streaming outside a strong connection doesn't really work unless you want to spend hundreds of dollars on mobile data a month. Interesting ideas. When data gets cheaper as the years go on I bet you'll see more of this.
Twitch,3dvyfi,deadlyslob,2,Mon Jul 20 03:08:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's quite right, on my plan I pay around £30 a month and I get unlimited data, as for speed, I have 4G everywhere I go in my city at least. But I guess if you live out in the sticks that could cause problems."
Twitch,3dvyfi,Zweihander98,4,Mon Jul 20 03:24:36 2015 UTC,Welcome to the US. Unless you pay a premium price there is no such things as unlimited data here. Most unlimited data plans are at least 100 USD (70 GDP? Don't know the converaion). I can get unlimited data with my carrier for 70 USD but the coverage is terrible.
Twitch,3dvyfi,Farva85,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:37:42 2015 UTC,"Good luck man, hopefully it all gets better. I'm not a big time streamer, but I still make a point of taking breaks. Make it a 'part of your stream' kind of thing maybe? I saw a streamer (200 viewers maybe) just kind of a do a 'stretch time' or 'break time'. I thought it was neat. I always believe in that sort of thing. Though others might hate it (don't know why).  Your health and well being comes before the stream in my opinion. Same for any job, not just streaming. So I'm not coming here from the 'streaming' stand point (as if it's my job), but just from what my actual job is (software engineer working from home alone. Gets pretty lonely in here. I made a point of taking an hour during lunch to work out (or before or after work). I feel so much better.  Yet again, realize you're not looking for advice (like others have said). Thank you for sharing though. Good luck and I hope it gets better!"
Twitch,3dvyfi,Kalikovision64,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have a myriad of issues, but one I'd point out is that ""top 3,000 streams for follows"" really isn't that high, when considering you're trying to make twitch a job.  That would be only 16K followers, which is most likely not enough to make a job out of twitch.  The fact is that very, very few streamers are able to pay for all their living expenses via twitch alone.  The added pressure of trying to make it a job before you're able to can make you miserable."
Twitch,3dvyfi,Tapeworms,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:20:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that streaming has become this horrinle, difficult monster in your life.  Have you thought about not streaming every day and taking a day off per week to hang with friends?"
Twitch,3dvyfi,AvalonAngel84,2,Mon Jul 20 06:33:24 2015 UTC,"The partnered streamers I sub/follow all take at least a day of not more off. I can't imagine someone being on 7 days a week for several hours, that can not be healthy. I definitely need two days off of my desk job that is only 8-12h a day.    I believe viewer can smell if a streamer isn't happy or healthy, no matter how good of an actor someone is they can smell it. Being happy and healthy results in a higher quality of life and higher viewer count in my opinion. Watching someone honestly enjoying what they do is much more appealing than someone struggling or constantly drunk.    This now honestly makes me question why the one streamer I watch irregular is constantly drunk :/"
Twitch,3dvyfi,Nyaliah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:55:20 2015 UTC,"one streamer I watch irregular is constantly drunk   It is commonly used as a social crutch, sort of the ""I'm not interesting enough to be entertaining without alcohol"" mentality. I speak from experience, which is why I haven't streamed in a while. When I am not streaming, I'm perfectly capable being a casual drinker. When I am streaming regularly, alcohol dependency is a real issue."

Twitch,3dvyfi,Nyaliah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"I've seen this before, in other streamers that I have come to know in my year + of streaming. Knowing how to balance your life in terms of sleep schedules, eating habits, and finding time for the real world is truly far more difficult then most will even begin to understand when one decides to be a serious streamer.  We're not machines, however I do understand that some viewers expect us to be. We get the whole ""Oh you can stream for a living, how hard can it be playing games all day?"". Having a schedule that includes ample amounts of time for yourself away from the computer is key here, ensure you get days off, ensure your chat knows you're going to take days here and there for yourself, and ensure you remember to make time for sleep and other required functions.  At the end of the day, you'll always have viewers that don't understand we're not chained to our computer desk 24/7, and do happen to have real lives. You'll never please everyone, ever."

A lot of streamers don't have jobs outside of streaming and get by on goodwill. Like if someone is streaming all the time and doing their best to entertain you, why is it so offensive for them to accept donations in exchange for that service?"
Twitch,3dtx31,alientonx,5,Sun Jul 19 23:43:41 2015 UTC,"Not offensive to accept tips, but pushing on your audience to pay your bills so you can basically play video games to maybe 20-50 people is a really cute way of saying ""As much as I really wish this would take off I refuse to take fiscal responsibility for my life.""   Even if my channel reached a point it could pay my bills, I would still get a part time job for the sole reason that people are coming to Twitch to relax, not get your by-proxy stress that you can't take care of yourself so pls hit the button and donate!!!  I don't ever want money to change how I do my community, because when you have days you don't make money, and you are relying on the Twitch Russian Roulette, that stress will come out, and it will turn off the people who support you."

So they can sit and watch what they get, and see the odds, without spend any money themselves.  It's like going to the casino, and you see someone who keeps winning big on the slot machine. You might sit there for a couple minutes watching them to see if they hit the jackpot. Doesn't affect you at all, and you won't get anything from it; but you still get a bit of entertainment out of it."

I was buying a Heros of the Storm key, and it kept pestering me to sign up for a free trial, so I decided why not, can't hurt. After I made my purchase, I looked a bit and decided it wasn't worth it, so I decided to cancel the free trial. Apparently, you can't do that until 28 days have passed in the 30 day free trial! If you are on vacation or forget about it it just autorenews, and even support can't change it.

They buy cheap keys from Russia or other countries where games are sold at a much lower price. In several cases the keys they are selling are stolen.  The keys tend to be legit though, but developers don't get a cut and there's also a risk that the key you buy is fake or it'll eventually be revoked by the publisher/developers.  /r/gamedeals for example have totally forbid grey market re-sellers because of how they operate."

Just have to use common sense, I've bought a ton of games on G2A through their official site while using G2A shield and I've never had any sort of problems.   You can't justify calling it a scam because some people sell shady keys on their site."

Steam has been using Luxenborg as a loophole to avoid paying taxes in EU countries. So they're scummy as well.  Pretty much every online key seller can be seen as shady.  I can understand why'd someone would choose not to use these keyseller sites but deciding not to watch a streamer because they're affiliated with G2A seems kinda silly to me personally.

Kthx, be back later to see if you fixed it"".  I only stopped by one stream where I actually said ""I can't hear you. The guys in teamspeak/mumble are 4x louder than you.

I don't know if it's an issue in other games as well, but if I come to watch you play Counter Strike i don't want to watch you chuck away a few thousand bucks on some shady raffle site. It seems to be more of an issue with bigger streamers (since the small once aren't sponsored or can't afford it) but it really gets my goat.  The other one is an overlay that takes up 50% of the screen. I get it if you're playing an old game that's a funny aspect ratio or needs a little bit of extra fluff on the screen but some people seriously overdo it. The best overlays are ones that compliment your content, not drown it out."

I see this happen with bigger steamers really when they don't have to hide their hate for things anymore and they can be their smug self. For example I was watching a streamer playing a Elder Scrolls game and he is known for playing them and someone in chat asked him if he was going to play Elder scrolls online and the streamer was very rude to him about it. Look I don't care if you have 10 viewers or 5k you don't act rude to the people who are watching you and supporting you, he could of simple said ""no im not that interested in ESO"" he just bashed the viewer and bashed the game, I left and followed him(was not the 1st time) sad I watched him for 3 years.

I personally dislike streams that feature women who overexpose their bodies. I know a lot of people don't mind them, this is just my opinion! And I don't dislike the women themselves, I dislike the stream attitude.   I'm a girl, and I understand the bad name that these types of streamers are giving 'normal' girls, even girls without facecam altogether. There's the negative outlook on girls who play games and they seem to add to it.  Another thing, I believe that a lot of these girls are in Twitch strictly for the money. Showing cleavage is a quick, easy way to obtain a 'donation hoard' following. A lot of them hardly read the chat and only pay attention to those who donate, which is upsetting.  Finally, a lot of them foster communities built on a negative empire. Whatever troll thing they can do to get a few more viewers, they will do it. This goes against everything that I've learned so far in my experience on Twitch; long term channels seem to require the positive attitude of their community to bring in new people and keep the old ones.  I'd love a good discussion here! What do you think?"

Twitch,3dtx31,sterlingwriter,7,Sun Jul 19 23:48:35 2015 UTC,"I completely 100% agree. I'm a female streamer as well. I've come across other female streamers who make it their ""shtick"" to put out their cleavage and to make themselves seem like ""super hot nerdy girls lolol"". What truly takes the cake for me is when girls cams take up more than 40% of their screen and their gameplay window is tiny and in the corner. What are you on twitch for if you aren't even focusing on gameplay. One streamer in particular that truly made my blood boil was a girl who ONLY had her cam on, full screen, and was getting FLOODS of followers because all she was doing was saying "" Hi thanks for following!"" To everyone. She even at one point grabbed her boobs and shook them for a commenter that told her to do it, and another commenter told her to show her feet and she did that as well. It really pissed me off. Absolutely ZERO gameplay or any thing to do with games at all."
Twitch,3dtx31,gumby_arobics,5,Sun Jul 19 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"It's a shame, really, that Twitch allows this to happen.

It's disappointing that Twitch fosters this tactic, but they have no intensive to stop when money rules over morals.

Twitch,3dtx31,PreferredSelection,6,Sun Jul 19 21:59:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not generally picky. I don't mind big streamers who use sub-only mode, because, once you're past a certain threshold, people can't chat anyway and it just becomes senseless meme spam. I don't mind people who use slow mode for the same reason. I also don't mind if someone's chat is filled with memes, however, because I can always just turn the chat off. I also don't mind people who hype themselves, because sometimes it's a good idea to let people know what you're planning for the future. And I don't mind when people's audio is fucked up, because sometimes it's difficult to check your audio while streaming; so long as an effort is made to fix it once it's pointed out, that's fine.  Here's what I do mind:   Taking the troll bait. I don't come to watch you argue with a troll. Ignore, ban, and move on. If you are going to argue with someone (who is not trolling), do it in a reasonable manner. Resorting to calling someone epithets (especially offensive epithets) will result in me closing your stream and never returning. Public disciplining. So someone broke the rules. Unless multiple people are breaking the same rule, you don't need to mention it in stream. People who constantly do this, and provide running commentary for every ban are not people I want to watch. If you're tilting, don't tilt in an unreasonable manner. I understand sometimes you just need to vent. ""The fucking RNG, man,"" is perfectly fine every now and then. But the same epithet rules from #2 apply in this case. The moment I hear you say, ""Why are you playing that deck, you f***?"" I'll turn off your stream. I hate when people have tons of shit all over their screen. This depends on what game a person is playing, however. For something like Hearthstone, I understand. There's a bunch of space that isn't used by the game. However, if you're playing a story-based game, I really don't give a shit what your chat has to say, who your last sub was, how much your last donation was, etc. I get that you want to acknowledge your supporters, but some games don't work well with that. So please turn it off and take periodic breaks to acknowledge your supporters. Otherwise, I probably won't want to watch you play it. Another personal preference, but constant negativity is a huge turn off. If all you have to say is negative shit, I probably won't follow your stream or watch it ever again. This is especially true if you make negative comments with long gaps where nothing is said in between. This suggests to me you don't have a positive personality because you don't use the time you could be saying something to be positive, constructive, or insightful. To be clear, there's a place for negativity, but if you have room to say something positive or constructive and you don't, I'm out. Not making an effort to fix the stream when someone points out something wrong. Again, I don't mind if come into the stream and something is off. I'll point it out if people aren't doing so already. But if you ignore my suggestion that you turn down your music, I'm out.   There are some other things that might cause me to close a stream, but they are personal preferences and often conditional. Someone can be funny and entertaining for others, but maybe I just don't like their style of humor or I think they talk too much. There may be some streamers whose music I don't like. Or maybe I don't like that they've muted a certain game's music in favor of playing their own. But those are not worth listing, because they are conditional and don't always apply. I might return when they aren't playing music I dislike, for example. Or I might return to see them play a certain game because maybe their personality fits with it even if it doesn't for other games. Stuff like that."
Twitch,3dtx31,FieryStix,5,Sun Jul 19 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"With regards to #5, the reason I show some chat on the screen is so that, if someone comes in right in the middle of a conversation, they can see at least half of the context for it. I'm always frustrated when I tune into a stream and the streamer is engaged in what seems like an interesting conversation, but I have no way of knowing what it's about. The previous chat helps to clarify that to some degree."
Twitch,3dtx31,jargonfacer,3,Sun Jul 19 22:49:13 2015 UTC,"Additionally a lot of streamers post VoDs to Youtube and having the chat on screen is a really useful point of reference (I mean, reading what your responding to is a good habit to get into but whatever.)

But I had multiple viewers asking for the chat overlay because most of my viewers apparently watch in fullscreen mode or on their cellphones and they want to keep up with the chat so I added it.
Twitch,3dtx31,SexyFishHorse,2,Mon Jul 20 11:37:27 2015 UTC,"So I stream (don't know why i never got the flair...) but I have to use a laptop for now. I have a few of the things people mention in here:   Audio Imbalance happens a lot, I don't have great equipment and have to use a laptop mic but do try to fix it when someone suggests a change.  Me and a few other streaming buddies will often dual stream or just voice chat during the stream to keep company. We poke fun of each other a lot. One is gay so he pokes fun at us for being straight and we make fun of him for the opposite, and things like that. Not sure how much of a turn away that is since we are being super sarcastic and always act this way... Lastly I do have some  stuff on my stream: Our Group's Logo, Recent Follower, Follower Count and a donation widget thing. The widget say PC Build and says I'm putting $$$ from my summer job towards it but should I remove it altogether?  The stream isn't professional looking to say the least but I would like to improve it for the time being until I have a desktop and second monitor."
Twitch,3dtx31,elsrjefe,2,Mon Jul 20 05:29:35 2015 UTC,"Audio Imbalance happens a lot, I don't have great equipment and have to use a laptop mic but do try to fix it when someone suggests a change.   As I said, if someone is making an effort to fix it, it's fine. So that's not really on the list.   Me and a few other streaming buddies will often dual stream or just voice chat during the stream to keep company. We poke fun of each other a lot. One is gay so he pokes fun at us for being straight and we make fun of him for the opposite, and things like that. Not sure how much of a turn away that is since we are being super sarcastic and always act this way...   This isn't the same as arguing with a troll or someone who is just being argumentative. Playful banter like that isn't on the list and is often entertaining.   Lastly I do have some stuff on my stream: Our Group's Logo, Recent Follower, Follower Count and a donation widget thing. The widget say PC Build and says I'm putting $$$ from my summer job towards it but should I remove it altogether? The stream isn't professional looking to say the least but I would like to improve it for the time being until I have a desktop and second monitor.   It only really applies to games where it matters. For example, The Walking Dead Game, The Last of Us, Bioshock. Anything story-based, really. That's where I don't want to see clutter. For competitive games where the focus is mostly in the center of the screen or not around the edges where the clutter is, it's fine."

But People who have Sub Only giveaways, Sub Only priveliges, Only read the subs chat even when sub only mode isn't on, that pisses me off."
Twitch,3dtx31,Da_Truth1400,3,Mon Jul 20 03:08:33 2015 UTC,"Well, these people pay an additional 5$ a month to keep the streamer doing what they do. I see nothing wrong with it at all, they want to attract a larger following of subs so they can stream full time, but then you have to give the subs some of their moneys worth to keep them happy. You pay, you get privilegies. That's just how the world works."
Twitch,3dtx31,Monobrah,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:36:08 2015 UTC,"Not the OP, but I agree with what you are saying. That being said, I was in a stream where a sub got timed out and the streamer basically said they shouldn't have gotten timed out because 1. they were a sub and 2. what he said wasn't that bad. The second reason was correct, he didn't really say anything that bad (was just a bad joke), but the first reason irked me. Obviously, this kind of goes back to the whole ""their house, their rules"" kind of thinking as well."

Others clearly don't see things that way and find that a turn-off, which is fine."

Twitch,3dtx31,rallei_lol,6,Mon Jul 20 07:15:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everything besides ""having fun with a game"". If you're not playing a game, go away; if you hate the game, go away; if every word out of your mouth is an excuse for why it was someone else's fault you lost, go away. Everyone loses once in a while, own it!  Lately I've been watching Cohh play Terraria. He's playing it on Mediumcore mode, which means that when he dies, all his stuff falls on the ground and he has to go get it . . . inevitably, this is right next to whatever killed him. I've watched him fail to retrieve his gear for half an hour straight and he's still laughing and trying to come up with a new plan to get it."

I believe this thread has some very good opinions and could help new streamers out a lot (myself included). Just remember, these are just some people's preferences and that doesn't mean you have to make your stream cater specifically to them. Just look at the most commonly agreed upon deal breakers and go from there. :)"
Twitch,3dtx31,spla08,2,Mon Jul 20 10:04:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not fussed by gamer-rage, stopping for chat discipline, music/no music, cams/no cams, or really anything else. I watch almost anything and love many streamers. The only things that will turn me off a stream and I'll probably never go back are:   Being a mean/trainwreck drunk. Drinking for fun while playing a game is fine. But I'm out if I sense the venom is real and not just messing about with your friends. Having a daily/monthly donate goal when you're not raising money for charity. Back in the day, donation widgets forced you to have a goal. Nowadays it just seems in poor taste. Using the term ""fag"" or being homophobic at all. It's also a good way to get banned and blocked from my channel and twitter, as one guy recently discovered. Having a shitty mod that just times out all your viewers while you're focusing on a game. I saw this recently and I peace'd out pretty fast. He seemed proud of it which makes it even worse. Breaking ToS/RoC. This won't just make me leave a channel, it'll make me report it for handling. Follow the rules, peeps."

Buuuut, I don't really like watching girls with their boobs out, I don't care if they wanna do it, but it gets annoying.   I also don't like it when people don't talk (if there is no one in the stream) they gotta seem entertaining!"
Twitch,3dtx31,Taj_Ramos,4,Sun Jul 19 12:52:46 2015 UTC,"The whole ""girls with their boobs out"" thing is a very difficult one.  There are many instances where a girl wears a tank top or something and gets shit for it on Twitch even though I've seen girls wear the same thing and get not a single nasty look from my super-conservative grandmother.    And I mean, it's not a good look when people who are known to overwhelmingly oppose the level censorship of nudity in American media have such huge issue with even partially exposed breasts."
Twitch,3dtx31,VampiraPassista,3,Sun Jul 19 22:51:50 2015 UTC,I honestly don't care about what they wanna wear. I have no problems with it. I just remember one girl with amazing boobs but it just kinda took over the whole screen and was a bit much haha.  Maybe I'm just jealous 😝

Twitch,3dtx31,Lynxaria,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:03:47 2015 UTC,No game music is fine but its more like music on top of the game. So I don't like listening to techno while I watch someone play hearthstone for example. I'm usually playing something on my other screen and you music interferes with my game experience so I usually watch streams that are quieter.

That's absurd in my opinion :p I don't have a camera though. I just switch that intermission screen on and tap away. I get if you're constantly on your phone, it'd be pretty bad to watch.

Question- if i welcome them to the stream, say ""hey so and so welcome"" if they say hello. Is the issue after the initial interaction and singling someone out?  On topic, i dislike when new or small streamers have a donation button as well. Once their community grows ill start to accept it. It makes me think theyre in this just for money, not the enjoyment or their community. I also hate when they dont check chat or show no emotion during stream if they have a cam. Let us know youre enjoying the game, please!  Other than that, if playing competitively i hate seeing bm. I feel its a little hypocrtitical as i  get really salty but its sonething that would turn some people away. And i have to work on it.

Twitch,3dtx31,Chewydon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:13 2015 UTC,"The issue is with if, say, a streamer's looking at the chat list, seeing someone and calling them out, without them saying anything."

Twitch,3dtx31,abbymakeup,2,Sun Jul 19 22:23:13 2015 UTC,"some good tips in here. also some weird ones.   if you see that the streamer has very little followers(perhaps new?) give them time to see you in chat and respond. I find that people jump into my chat, say HI and then leave if I don't instantly respond. I use chatty for the chat and whether it's the program or just twitch or whatever, I sometimes don't see that someone has joined or typed in chat until they are leaving(i quite often get all the notifications at once). I'm sure there are some people that ignore chat, or don't know how to play and watch chat(only one monitor). I do insta ban G2A links and the like tho.  as for what make me not watch a stream, generally someone wearing their revealing clothing, all hangin out and such. Kinda feels like i'm watching a cam show and not a stream about a game.  Also I don't play a lot of the games that other play, and I'm not going to watch a stream for something I'm not interested in."
Twitch,3dtx31,Mr_Quackums,3,Mon Jul 20 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"This happens to me all the time! I've only been streaming for about a month. I always interact with my chat, but I got really into my game and would only look over at my chat once every 45 seconds or so (which is longer than usual for me). Every once in a while I will get someone that comes in my chat and says hi, and then not even 20 seconds later says ""you need to interact with your chat if you want a following."" :( I'm trying! It's just I'm playing a game while also reading the chat and there's about a 30 second delay between when I say things and when the stream hears it! GAAAAAH!!!"
Twitch,3dtx31,Kylex89,3,Sun Jul 19 16:39:40 2015 UTC,I know its a catch 22 but if your chat is large and active enough then the people who are there to interact will tend to interact with chat and not be so upset that you are not personally greeting them.
Twitch,3dtx31,didrosgaming,-3,Sun Jul 19 19:21:00 2015 UTC,People who have like 5 followers and put a donation button on there page. Sorry but that really bugs me.
Twitch,3dtx31,Nextbignothin,29,Sun Jul 19 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"okay, I wasn't going to respond to this, but it really really bothered me. Now imagine that you go downtown and there is a walking mall and some people have decided to perform on the street, you know street performers.  Now imagine you and a friend are walking around enjoying all of these performers for free and you stop at one who is way off to the side with no one watching and you stop and watch them juggle or what have you. Your friend comes up to you and immediately says, ""lets leave"" you inquire why, as it's an entertaining show. Your friend looks you dead in the eye and says, ""they don't have a following and have a hat out for donations, I refuse to watch a person like that"" and what do you think of your friend in this moment?  I already think the amount of support streamers get is incredibly low for the amount of effort they put into entertaining us. I totally understand if you can't afford to tip someone you are watching for entertaining you, we all have been in that spot in our lives, but the people that get mad about people simply allowing tips in a small stream make me sad. who do you think needs a tip more? a streamer with 1 viewer who streams 48 hours a week, or the one with 4k viewers and streams 20 hours a week and has a sub button/ad revenue...  tl:dr This turned into a rant, but seriously, think about twitch more like street performing and tip if you enjoy a show for a few hours."
Twitch,3dtx31,abbymakeup,9,Sun Jul 19 13:50:09 2015 UTC,"I love this train of thought.   As a former streamer (and tiny one at that) I worked my butt off on my stream.  Spent a lot of money on it, trying to be entertaining and it was a confidence boost when things go well.  So imagine my excitement when I got my first (and only) tip.    As a result, I will tip anyone who works so hard to entertain strangers.   Plus, you know it makes their day.  I know.because that $5 bill made mine."

(One of the reasons I also unfollowed iPwnstar4hire or whatever the hell he goes by now.) Showing off your boobs. It's cool if you wanna wear a tank, i know it can get hot with two computers on and no A/C or bad A/C but having a high camera angle to show off maximum cleavage is a big turn off. It just shows the kind of people I'm going to encounter in chat, which is the main reason I stay. Keep the camera at eye level, just like you would have learned in film school. It's fine if you show it, but don't make it the focal part of your stream. Too high quality. If they're not partnered, I hate being forced to watch 1080p quality. My internet is shit and generally if anyone streams above 720 and doesn't have the option to tone it down, I leave because it'll constantly buffer. Annoying rules/mods. If I have to follow you on all your platforms and fill out a form to just be able to say ""hi"" in chat, then I want no part of you. If you're mods are a dick to me then I'll leave. If you time me out for just saying something interesting then I'm never coming back. People who take the game way too seriously. I get it that sometimes you want to beat a boss, but don't visibly get flustered if you don't get a flawless gameplay or something."

Twitch,3dtx31,ItzWarty,7,Sun Jul 19 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly surprise this post has so many dislikes.  Everything sounds fine until the last one.  1) Don't ask for donations.  You can put up a button to donate and have donations pop up on screen to thank them, but don't be asking for them.  2) I'm pretty sure this point is against Twitch's Terms Of Service or something.  What was it, something about Nerds are beautiful people but please keep you're clothes on?  3) If you're not partnered your viewers cannot change you're quality.  If you stream in HD you'd fry some computers.  Stream at a low quality that isn't too low.  You need to find the perfect medium  4)  Rules are important.  I don't know what DrShady's talking about with an application but your moderators are a representation of oneself.  If one of my mods were to do something stupid in chat, the translation is that Dcat's stupid.  5)  People who take the game too seriously.  I actually think it's funny when people get so into a game that they stop thinking of anything else but beating the boss or level they are stuck on."

Having a follower alert is nice as a new streamer because it won't be constantly going off and it's also nice to show people your appreciation by following you as you're just starting out.   I can totally agree with the second point though, it definitely doesn't belong on Twitch and I avoid streamers like that altogether."

Be on a Skype call, especially with more than one person.  Yes, this includes multi-streams.  If you're playing a game and chatting with people on a phone call, you're ignoring chat.  It can be acceptable in some situations depending on the person, but it should be pretty rare.  The last thing I'm interested in for a new streamer is to listen to two people I don't know have a conversation that has nothing to do with the game. Being rude to people in chat.  Yes, chat is a bunch of assholes.  Just ban them.  Don't act out.  If you rise to the trolls, they'll just come back, and wasting everybody's time with trolls is really tiresome.  You know those streamers who get the same weird question over and over and it clearly pisses them off?  Why do you think it's just them that get that question? Being angry or frustrated with the game.  Some people can pull it off and be amusing to some people (MANvsGAME).  You probably just turn people off or look immature. Follower notifications.  Seriously, just don't.  Sub and donation notifications are already out of hand."

Twitch,3du8ix,FlushGun,12,Sun Jul 19 15:01:59 2015 UTC,"I think, and this has been my experience, that paying too much attention to how many viewers u have every stream can drive you mad.  I started streaming on justin.tv back in 2011, but i only streamed for like 3 weeks and had to stop, durting that time i was doing the whole looking at my viewers every like 30 secs. Looking back now i feel like that was a really bad thing to do. It takes you away from the game, and makes you lose focus. Also it can bring your attitude down, because maybe nobody is watching and so u feel down and sad, and as a result the stream suffers.  I started streaming again about 2-3 weeks ago, and said to myself ""I am not gonna look at my viewer count EVER"", and that is what ive done.  So far ive broadcasted around 12 times ( had a 2 week vacation to hang with family) and im at 48 followers, with maybe like 1 concurrent viewer haha. But even with that, not looking at the viewer count HELPS A TON, makes me focus on the game and my commentary, you never know when someone is watching so it makes you keep the commentary fresh and constant throughout the stream.  This is just my experience :P anyways i wish you the best man hang in there and keep doing what you do, good luck"
Twitch,3du8ix,arc_joe,5,Sun Jul 19 16:57:42 2015 UTC,I have to second not looking at the viewer count. My boyfriend is a partnered streamer who often reaches 1k+ viewers per stream and he still has NEVER looked at the viewer count since day one. This is the biggest advice he gives to all new streamers. If you're having fun the viewer count shouldn't matter. It only gets into your head if you see a sudden drop.   We even purge messages that state the viewer count and it's a rule in the channel to not post the viewer count. It keeps the anxiety down and makes sure you're streaming for the right reasons.  Best of luck to you and everyone else! :)
Twitch,3du8ix,aim_b0t,2,Sun Jul 19 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely dude and thanks for stopping by the stream! I 100% agree  that it is best not to look at the viewer count. While it is tempting, I'm still learning to not look at it. Thanks for sharing your experience, I hit you a follow and will be stopping by your streams in the future!"

Twitch,3du8ix,kevinelguapo,3,Sun Jul 19 16:29:18 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, thank you for doing this challenge and thank you for this post. Extremely informing and I think many of us can learn a thing or two here.  Now... on to the real talk. After 42 days of streaming straight, I looked at your profile and saw that you have almost 400 followers + you mention you consistently average over 10 concurrent viewers and oftentimes much more. You seriously thought about quitting? Do you know how many people dream of having those numbers after one and a half months? I'm sure many of us in here have tried just as hard, maybe even harder than you have in the past month and haven't found that kind of success yet. I've watched an awesome streamer, who has streamed almost every day for the past month. He's very nice and very entertaining. Yet, I'm usually the only one in there. Streaming is a roller coaster. You're gonna have bad days and good days... bad weeks and good weeks. I'm sorry, I know I sound jealous/frustrated and it sounds like I'm bitching; I really don't mean it. Just want to keep your head up, man. After all, I understand exactly where you're coming from. It's easy to feel discouraged when your numbers start to decline, plus a combination of being burned out from streaming every single day. The reason this post relates so much to me, is because we have the same exact stories. I also started streaming 8 months ago, on and off. Like you, I also took the challenge of streaming every single day over the summer, before school starts up again. Over the past two months; I gained over 150 followers, just hit 300 last night, viewers will peak at 20-ish during stream, concurrent viewers is generally around 10-15, and the highest peak ever was 32. As you can see, our numbers are similar. I felt the exact same things that you mentioned in your post. It wasn't until recently that I changed my mindset and realized just how fortunate I've been. I would like to think that hard-work has helped me the most, but I would be blind to not acknowledge that a little bit of luck fell into my lap.  Anyway, thank you for reading and good luck all the way man!"
Twitch,3du8ix,NightCulex,2,Sun Jul 19 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"Great read. Yeah, I have to admit it got to my head once I started to go up in viewer counts, it was hard for me to see it go down as well. I felt like I was doing something wrong, and that only worsened my mood and overall stream. Taking a few days off the stream helped me remember what I had and that I should be happy for those that do stick around. I'm learning as I go along in the stream. Thanks for the story, nice to know we have a lot in common! I gave you a follow, love me some Hearthstone! Good luck to you too my friend!"
Twitch,3du8ix,slipknutz,3,Sun Jul 19 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"Dont play for views, play for fun or it's a job. Views will be a side effect. There's a mathematic formula determining how many followers you get over time. Looking at socialblade our grade is the same despite me being only 3 weeks. There are times I'm not streaming I get followers. Lawlz. I set up one scene for everything since obs will delete it's scenes.config if you blue screen. Green screen rocks though. Some games get more viewers, I don't care. Any game can get 200+ viewers with enough following. Gotta put in the time, people will come to know you after a while. Have a girl use your webcam if you want a different math formula for subscribers. I mean viewers. Not really."
Twitch,3du8ix,Pipnotiq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:42:08 2015 UTC,"I had that happen with OBS, so I export my OBS profile, and OBS configuration. It saves everything. When OBS blue screens my PC, and wipes all its settings, I quickly import the OBS profile and OBS configuration and everything is exactly the way it was before the blue screen. Just remember to update your exports of OBS profile and configuration.   If you are unsure on what I mean, let me explain it in detail. If you know what I mean, maybe this will help someone else.   1.) In OBS, in the top menu bar, I select profiles, then export. It saves by default to your documents. I then delete my old save, and select save.   2.) In OBS, in the top menu bar, I select scene collections, then export. It saves by default to your documents. I then delete my old save, and select save.   Now when your OBS wipes everything, instead of hitting export, do the opposite and hit import. BAM! everything is back. Get as crazy as you want with your settings. You will never lose them again!"
Twitch,3du8ix,AngriestBird,2,Mon Jul 20 17:26:33 2015 UTC,"I would encourage you to keep the donate button going forward, after the 24 hr stream. I know me personally, I like contributing to smaller channels and having the alert pop up, me put on a ""wall of fame"" or whatever they happen to have, and be thanked for it. It's kind of like an investment in a sense, and I'm more likely to continue tuning in to streams I've donated to.  I've been donated to on my stream, and I'm always like ""oh hey thanks"" but it doesn't give that same satisfaction as donating yourself. It was a big surprise discovering that."

Twitch,3dw7ro,Ramautso,3,Mon Jul 20 01:55:29 2015 UTC,The only thing I could think of is contacting a staff member after putting in your partnership application and tell them the situation.

Twitch,3dw7ro,Birdor000,3,Mon Jul 20 01:56:33 2015 UTC,Since you're 20 now - no it won't affect you. When you become partnered you sign a partnership agreement and W8 form. If they require ID or some proof of age you'll have it.

Twitch,3dwbcc,puppyhugger,3,Mon Jul 20 01:55:29 2015 UTC,"That's a bummer =( - Maybe get other viewers to come and help you votekick? Have you tried the in-game report system or contacting the game's customer service? If it's not F2P and prone to account creation, I'm sure they'd help you out under the lines of harassment.  I think the other thing's to not feed the trolls - don't react to them and they usually disappear. Back in 2010 I streamed LoL and made practice games with my viewers (full 5v5s). Some viewers would routinely join and intentionally feed, to the point where I needed a banlist, and I let that get to me."
Twitch,3dwbcc,ItzWarty,2,Mon Jul 20 03:29:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't have many viewers so I'll have like maybe 2 of them in the server to help me votekick him/them ;-; I've reported him and his friends in game and on Steam.

Twitch,3dwbcc,ItzWarty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:39:04 2015 UTC,"Customer support systems often have faster turnarounds than report systems (especially if you put them under something like harassment/stalking, since those are usually pretty clear-cut cases).

Twitch,3dwbcc,deadlyslob,2,Mon Jul 20 03:40:00 2015 UTC,Go offline on steam. That should prevent them from joining your game. Also try to hide your server details.

Twitch,3dwbcc,Brawli55,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:16:00 2015 UTC,I'd also try not to make a point of it and to not bring attention to it. Especially if you know he's following you. They do it because they get attention. Good luck! Lots of good suggestions though I think so far (going offline mode when you're with your friends already in the lobby if possible).

Twitch,3dw72w,crowbargames,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:17:01 2015 UTC,Could livestreamer be used to display someone else's stream on your stream? Maybe as a brb screen or something? I know some people don't have the internet necessary to run two streams at once.
Twitch,3dw72w,Pipnotiq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:20:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand your question. Livestreamer basically just takes a channel url as input and directs the video into some media application on your PC (vlc by default but I think any major media player would work).      If you use livestreamer to view someone's stream on a media player on your PC and then capture that video into your own stream, you would be using essentially the same bandwidth as streaming it through twitch.      Livestreamer just eliminates the use of a browser. This has been my experience with it anyways. If in doubt, watch your network monitor while viewing a stream through a browser and through livestreamer and see how they compare."
Twitch,3dw72w,crowbargames,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:28:19 2015 UTC,"I meant like if I hypothetically wanted to do a picture-in-picture with my stream and someone else's via OBS, and allow people to watch it that otherwise wouldn't have been able to use multitwitch due to bad internet."
Twitch,3dw72w,Pipnotiq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:05:24 2015 UTC,"Oh! From the viewers perspective? In that case, yeah I guess what you're saying would be right.      As a broadcaster, you would be using more bandwidth (you would be downloading another users stream as well as uploading your stream with the other stream included in the video) but as a viewer, they would only be downloading your single stream instead of two streams.      Though I'm not sure what the etiquette is for playing someone else's stream within your channel. But aside from that, I believe it would work as your intending."
Twitch,3dw72w,crowbargames,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:53 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay that's cool. Yeah bandwidth is no issue for me now that I've upgraded my net, and I'd for sure ask for permission before playing other peoples streams. At least the options there. :)"

It's hard to say what brings viewers into streams because not everyone wants to watch the same person. Everyone is different, so as long as you have fun playing your games and talking to your chat, you'll have viewers.  GL/HF"
Twitch,3dvx0y,userrnam,2,Mon Jul 20 00:54:35 2015 UTC,"I'm new too!  I found that there's tonnes of great information on this subreddit already. I read most of the top rated posts and searched keywords like ""tips"" ""advice"" ""new"" ""grow"" etc. And also searched for my game (Runescape)   I think the biggest thing is being consistent and setting yourself a schedule to stick to. Then interact and be friendly with your chat. :) they will come back."
Twitch,3dvx0y,kittakee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty much just repeating information here. I used to stream speed runs of a game that no one knew, trying to get friends to come in and have a good time and spread word of my stream around. Never happened.   I just started streaming a challenge run of dark souls, completely relaxed, and ive been growing, albeit slowly, day by day. While i second something like ""be yourself, dont stream things just to get views"" i also have to say, dont stream things that dont get views. If no one is consistently in a game dont expect it to grow much, if at all. All in all, just be yourself. Dont focus on growing all at once, let it come naturally. Look over your vods and ask yourself, ""what did i dislike about my own stream? Where can i improve?"""

Twitch,3dupsx,LHBaconworthy,8,Sun Jul 19 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"Your stream is not the games you play, but you yourself. Start branching out. Yes, You'll lose viewers but also gain new ones. You don't want to be shoe-horned into a certain game (unless you do, in which case uhhhhh I dunno), it's the way, I found out, to disappoint both viewers who are use to you playing a certain game day-in; day-out and frankly, I never found playing the same game for so long to be all that fulfilling. If you want to be a streamer that provides a unique experience every time you push record, then just branching out is the most direct step.   If you don't want to completely alienate your audience, try to find games in the same vein as COD Zombies (like Left 4 Dead or Contagion) as a compromise of sorts and then slowly branch yourself out."

The ones that watch you play a different game other than your main/regular game(s) are the viewers you'll learn to appreciate more, because they like you as a person rather than the game you play. :D"
Twitch,3dupsx,drewlinskii,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, you're the entertainment - the game is just a tool.  It also helps to think about what kind of people your viewers are. Big companies put a lot of work into profiling their users to figure out what they want.  But as some other people have pointed out, perhaps your current audience may not scale out directly, and you'll have better luck with a wider demographic.  Since you seem to have a solid FPS follower-base, perhaps you'll have more luck with other games of the style?  It may also help to make a 'thing' out of your different games.  ""FPS guy plays ETS2 and fails horribly"" or what have you - make the quirk that you ARE an FPS main and make a point of trying a new random game every week, maybe even get the users to suggest it (or say you'll play anything that someone gifts you on steam :)"
Twitch,3dupsx,chhopsky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:08:43 2015 UTC,"Set dedicated timeslots for games like COD Zombies where you know you have a fanbase. That way, when you're playing something else you can say ""Yup, I'll be playing that on Monday/Thursday/whatever."" Then they know that you haven't abandoned the game they enjoy.  As a variety streamer, you just need to remember that you'll never bring all your viewers across to every game. Some people only care about FPS action, some only watch Euro Truck. Others will want to hang out with you no matter what. Find a good balance that keeps you interested and don't get down when numbers are lower. Put on a good show and you'll slowly increase the group that will watch you play everything."

I loved GMod, but I didnt want to play it 24/7. When I did switch to other games, my active viewers would drop from 35-50 to 5-10."
Twitch,3dupsx,Brawli55,2,Sun Jul 19 23:09:29 2015 UTC,"You don't.  There are tribal communities on Twitch that only like to watch a single game, or genre of games. If you get in good with one these communities it can often be very easy to grow your channel, but these people are more so there to see the game being played and not you. There is nothing wrong with that - just the nature of the beast.  That said there will be some viewers who grow to really enjoy the channel itself, and it those kind of viewers you should be cultivating. How do you do that? Hell if I know - each viewer is an individual, so coming up with a game plan to cater to each viewer's idiosyncratic needs is impossible. The best you can do is put on the best damn show possible and be personable with your viewers; make them come to your channel for you, and not the game."
Twitch,3dupsx,Jesuswept669,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"I'm semi successful doing this. I started with Zombie games and have slowly branched out still keeping my core viewership.

It's a much slower process building that more solid foundation of core viewers that will follow you to the ends of the earth, but ti pays off when switching it up."

Twitch,3dvod5,shelbychiin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:32:33 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I'm not an artist, but I'm also a Twitch streamer that rarely plays games on stream (I'm a programmer that streams game development). My stream isn't usually very interesting to watch, since I'm mostly hacking away at code that most viewers don't understand, but I still have followers that spend hours watching my stream and seem to enjoy it. One of the things that some of the regular viewers really enjoy is that I have NightBot in my channel to take song requests from users. It can be a bit annoying when people play music I don't enjoy, but for the most part my viewers select decent music, and being able to take turns playing DJ keeps people around to listen to the songs they picked.  If you're normally quiet, talking more on stream and interacting with viewers always makes a stream more engaging. Other than those suggestions, as you get bigger and put more time into improving your stream you might want to get an extra web cam, seems like some of the more popular art streamers have multiple angles on their stream, like one camera showing a close up of the painting/drawing, and another smaller window showing a zoomed out view of you working on your art.  Other than that, just stream a ton, or at least stream on a regular schedule! A lot of Twitch viewers are just trying to find a channel to hang out and make friends in. The more often your stream is up, the easier it is for a community to form around your channel since users can start to expect when it will be up. On the other hand, when you take a break and don't stream on your normal schedule, you might upset some viewers, so make sure to pick a schedule you can stick to. Good luck!"
Twitch,3dvod5,PeoplePoweredGames,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:29:21 2015 UTC,"Hi! Thank you for the input. Yes, it does seem to provide a relaxed atmosphere and such. I don't think I can mic because drawing and talking is indeed really difficult aha. Oh alright, my schedule is kind of unbalanced, is that fine? I do stream everyday but at random times; would that affect gaining viewers greatly?"
Twitch,3dvod5,roodleypoodleydoodle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"The obvious answer is to just be skilled at what you do. People will naturally flock to artists better than them for questions and critique.   If you're just grinding out some rendering, gestures, etc. and have music playing, I know that some people like to turn streams on solely to listen to another person's music  Maybe draw things your viewers request in chat?   I feel like art streams tend to lean toward a more relaxed atmosphere just because of the nature of the content, and talking while drawing might be difficult. Especially after several hours. I know I don't get much done if I'm splitting my attention between chat and a piece, so I opt to do art stuff offstream.   And if you're a studying artist, I'd just advise focusing on forwarding the art itself versus foot traffic."

Twitch,3duupj,Ferhmal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:18:28 2015 UTC,"A game that is played in virtually the same way by a large group of people. Lack of diversity in play style, team dynamic, and personality, for example."
Twitch,3duupj,Beazleburbicus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:34:05 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Do the number of active channels ever influence your choices?
Twitch,3duupj,Beazleburbicus,2,Sun Jul 19 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"Yes and No. If I feel I can create a unique enough experience for my audience, then I will play anything, regardless of saturation. However, If the game is too linear or lacks diversity in play, then more likely than not, I won't"
Twitch,3duupj,Chewydon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:06:44 2015 UTC,"If I'm letting myself play for viewers (dangerous mindset), I stick to these three rules:   Less than 1000 watching but greater than 50.  Largest streamer in game has at most 500  Next closest steamers have 20-50 before wall of 1-5 viewer streams.   Don't play for viewers, it becomes borderline masochistic. Only feeling I can relate it to is an addiction to gambling."
Twitch,3duupj,weefz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:10:05 2015 UTC,"By over saturated, you mean too many for me to stream on? I don't care about the number of channels in total. As others say, it's about getting on the front page.  Assuming it's my normal stream slot, I can count on x number of regulars to show up and any more is a bonus. If x puts me out of the top 10 for that game then it's too saturated for me. There could be 10 channels lower than my average, or 1000. They're all irrelevant to my purposes.  Of course, I'll still stream popular games like ARK because I enjoy them. Some days you want to maximise your chances of being discovered, some you just wanna have fun with your viewers."
Twitch,3duupj,Oremm,0,Mon Jul 20 11:32:14 2015 UTC,"If the game's category takes up more than one screen on my browser, it's too full.  So about 24 channels then we're done 'cuz I'm not going to go scrolling."
Twitch,3duupj,doomrah,2,Sun Jul 19 18:25:31 2015 UTC,2nd page of twitch is starting to become the 2nd page of Google search results. Your % drops drastically on viewership IMO.   If you play one of those be prepared to have 0 viewers or get a lot of people you know to bump you up pages.

Keep doing what you're doing, however you feel safest doing it.  The only thing to worry about is the perception that you're rigging it for your friends.  There are plenty of ways to get around this, especially if you think creatively.  Perhaps there's something you could do with pastebin, or some other external third party site that requires the user to visit and find something on the page - that way there's visibility to the fact that someone legitimately won.  I'm sure you'll come up with something!  But even if you don't, just don't sweat it - you did nothing wrong.  Just shake it off, shake it off, ah ah"

Better yet, download the chrome extension for giveaways, and it allows you to do a giveaway based off of a keyword, or simply being active in chat (Towelliee uses it for all his giveaways)"

Twitch,3dudem,Sadzeih,5,Sun Jul 19 15:50:18 2015 UTC,"Silly as it sounds, streaming with a french accent differentiates you from other people and instantly makes you more interesting .. possibly more dreamy.

Twitch,3dudem,chhopsky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:54:14 2015 UTC,It's a good point. Honestly I would prefer to stream in English but I could only stream with internet people and that's great but I also want to share games with my french mates. I don't really know how I could do both.
Twitch,3dudem,chhopsky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:10:37 2015 UTC,I suppose it's a targeting problem then!  It's difficult to do both.  Two channels?

Twitch,3dudem,Epileptic_Toad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:54:12 2015 UTC,"absolutely.  but it's even more difficult to maintain a dual brand identity, unless you can somehow incorporate these in a way that are of interest.  People are going to get notifications that you're live, and tune in to find its not the one they want, so there's going to have to be something for them, regardless, I think.  Just my thoughts anyway :)"
Twitch,3dudem,Heep123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:58:08 2015 UTC,"I forgot to answer the friends part in my other reply and it comes down to 2 things : what kind of game do you plan to stream and do your friends speak english ? If you plan to stream singleplayer game, you can go with whatever you prefer. But if you want to stream multiplayer with friends only speaking french, I guess you'll have to stick with french unless you're ready to explain your viewers what's going on (and that would be pretty hard to do, live)."
Twitch,3dudem,Dejawon,2,Mon Jul 20 12:03:05 2015 UTC,"You are more likely to appeal to more people when streaming in English. But, you will be much more unique than other streamers playing in the same directory as you."

Twitch,3dudem,Beazleburbicus,2,Sun Jul 19 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"Well, to be honest. If you stream in french you will get big! If you are serious! less competition.

Twitch,3dv5ni,Pipnotiq,2,Sun Jul 19 19:53:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd go with Monday-Thursday but stream between 4-6 hours instead of 2 every day....  4+ hours give viewers much more time to show up to your stream compared to 2 hours.
Twitch,3dv5ni,AvalonAngel84,2,Sun Jul 19 21:03:31 2015 UTC,"Every channel I've studied has lower viewer counts on a Friday night (BST timezone) than other evenings so I did what you're considering and just dropped Friday from my schedule. There's an argument to be made that streaming at off-peak times makes it easier to attract new viewers but for me, having that little bit of social life outweighs it.  I'm in a similar boat with fiancé and friends, so I've made Friday and Saturday my guaranteed non-streaming days. Mon-Thu I get about an hour with my fiancé over dinner when he's home from work, then stream for 5-6 hours. He gets loads of uninterrupted time to watch boring documentaries on Netflix or whatever and we make the most of the weekends."
Twitch,3dv5ni,weefz,2,Mon Jul 20 11:55:49 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to stream less days but longer times. Building an audience can take a while sometimes,   good luck buddy   Rocky"

Twitch,3duyxr,jblumz,2,Sun Jul 19 18:57:50 2015 UTC,I believe there are some tips within the side bar about how to avoid this problem. A quick and easy tip would be to go into your settings and make your ip a globally banned word in chat so it will only show *** when some tries to use it.
Twitch,3duyxr,Birdor000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:51:05 2015 UTC,People get around it unfortunately :/
Twitch,3duyxr,chhopsky,2,Sun Jul 19 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"Twitch itself doesn't expose your IP at all, so it'll be something else you use doing it.  Do you use any plugins or external tools for music / voice / donations / etc?  Skype, for one, exposes your IP.  If they've got your skype username chances are that's how they're finding your IP.  People frequently re-use usernames, so most of it's just sheer guesses."
Twitch,3duyxr,chhopsky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't post my skype username. I have the song requests, and do take viewer calls via google voice. They wouldn't be able to get my phone number though via google voice, I used a fake one."
Twitch,3duyxr,chhopsky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:54:14 2015 UTC,"It's more about any direct connections from your computer.  It's possible that they captured the Google Voice SIP traffic, and the annoying thing about SIP is that it often includes the originating IP, even after NAT and SIP gateways etc.  It's worth thinking about any other services in which you use a similar username, as it could be something you haven't thought of that someone's tracked you to.  Perhaps posting links to your channel on a forum, or similar."

Twitch,3duyxr,Smagjus,2,Sun Jul 19 20:19:08 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately not - everything that leads to this kind of thing happens outside of Twitch, and is completely out of our control.  It's all about the personal internet habits of the person in question.  In the corporate world we'd enforce security restrictions on the end-user computer, and putt in fancy firewalls, but it would be really unfair to try to enforce minimum security requirements on end-users.  It's easy to see how it happens, because people want to increase their online visibility .. and in doing so, increase their online vulnerability.  It's kind of like being famous - the more info about you is out there, the more people can use it.  The best we can do is try to educate users on better securing their online presence, and hope that they're careful.

Both will get a reasonable starting point for you.  It's important to note that the settings are generally settings for the x264 codec and will be the same no matter what software you are using (OBS, OBS-M, XSplit, Wirecast, etc.) The big differences are between different codecs, such as NVENC and QuickSync."

Twitch,3dtusx,Fash202,2,Sun Jul 19 12:14:55 2015 UTC,"Try using a different channel on the wireless. perhaps get a program to show all the wireless networks and which channels they are on.     If you have a lot of networks on the same channel as yours, that can confuse a lot of devices and make the internet crappy."
Twitch,3dtusx,Pawn1990,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:16:30 2015 UTC,"Wifi speed isn't as simple as just you get x speed and that's it.  Because you're sharing the air with everyone else, the chances of a collision with someone else's packet are too damn high.  Each chunk of video that comes down has a chance of being corrupted by collisions on your Wifi.  Now even if you only lose 10% of your packets, the chance of losing a chunk is still quite high.  The protocols and formats do their best to work around packet loss and interruption of the stream, and there are a lot of cool tricks in play to keep it running.  But long story short, even if your wifi is fast, there's no guarantee that it's also reliable.  The best thing you can do is use a wifi listener to find out what other networks are around your house and what channels they're on, then configure your wifi to the channel that's used the least.  Try Wifi Explorer if you have a mac, or Wifi Analyzer if your iDevice is jailbroken."

Twitch,3durpe,FadedSlowBro,3,Sun Jul 19 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"That's really cool!  I'm glad it was such a great experience for you.  The easiest thing to do is to buy something for him that's already in Wales, from a welsh web site and get it shipped straight there.  International mail makes everything way more expensive, sometimes prohibitively so.  I gave away one of my old macbooks once to a guy overseas, which seemed like a great idea at the time.  But then there were all sorts of problems because I was shipping a battery overseas, then had to ship it separately, with special packaging, and there was customs, and all sorts of trouble.  It ended up costing roughly 4x what I had expected.  But, something from you will be much more personalised and form a stronger viewer connection, especially if that user then shares about it on social media.  So it's really up to you whether you want more expense / difficulty but better result vs easier.  But all that said, getting free stuff is awesome and he will be stoked anyway.  So my vote is for buying local to him."

While streaming it's obviously lots more space for your chat and whatnot"
Twitch,3dttal,kitkamran,2,Sun Jul 19 12:18:52 2015 UTC,2 monitors allow for a game screen and a stream screen. So you can have chat+OBS+music+whatever on one screen and the game on the other. A capture card allows you to play console games and/or have a 2-pc setup.
Twitch,3dttal,GrindheadJim,2,Sun Jul 19 13:24:32 2015 UTC,"I used a single screen with a tablet or smartphone for chat monitoring for a long time.  Upgraded to a dual monitor setup, and I will never go back.  Being able to manage anything on that second screen while gameplay is on the primary is so much better.  I use a capture card for consoles, and game capture PC stuff - having the second monitor enables me to have the exact same setup, no matter what I am playing, and I love it!  I do use a green screen, but took a hiatus when I got the new monitor setup, as I moved the part of the room I was in, and ordered lights - eerie parallel to the OP's question. :p  TL;DR  Multiple monitors aren't required, but they make life as a streamer so much easier."

Twitch,3drowh,illuminauhty,3,Sat Jul 18 20:47:25 2015 UTC,"This post is great! I do have one question, though:  How quickly would you suggest a person set up all these things? Or even just some of them. I've sort of been using my personal Twitter to promote when I go live, but as for everything else I'm wondering if it would be overzealous of me to, say, set up a Facebook page branding myself when I still have less than 50 followers, y'know?"
Twitch,3drowh,P_TOG,4,Sat Jul 18 22:22:12 2015 UTC,"Hey there, I am not that big on Twitch but I have a few subs on YouTube nowadays. In my opinion, having social media pages dedicated to your Twitch channel looks professional, not overzealous. There's not been a single time that I've seen a smaller streamer or YouTuber being active with their fan base on Twitter or Facebook and thought anything but highly of them.  Having social media drives the interaction that you really want in the early stages of growing a channel. At 50 followers, individuals matter, and interacting with them is a good way to establish a community and grow off of that foundation.   Having a foundation of people who come back to your stream again and again is priceless, I've realized. I used my YouTube channel to skip right over the early stages, and it's a shame to have a 'web' community instead of a solid 'fabric' community, if that makes any sense. People come and go, and I don't recognize people in the chat.  I personally found that Twitter is the easiest to maintain (as it's considered a microblogging site) but Facebook can be just as easy. Reddit is less of a 'social media' site, however it can be extremely useful (Reddit communities such as r/leagueoflegends can pull hundreds of thousands of viewers, however, the occurrence is rare, random, and unreliable). Twitter and Facebook are fantastic, I believe.  All in all, I say run the pages! It will benefit you with time, I promise. And it's fun!  On a side note, I would also invest a little bit of design into these pages, try to purchase some personalized artwork for your banner and avatar if this is something you really want to do. Even if it's a hobby, you can feel good with your pimped out channel! Best of luck to you, I'm sure things are going to go great."

Twitch,3drowh,luckyariane,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:56:56 2015 UTC,If I make a Facebook page from my personal Facebook account  will it be linked back to it in any way?  Or is it safest to create a separate FB login.   Also another platform that I've been trying out as a streamer is Discord. It's a replacement for voice chat programs that also has really nice chat features. I've been advertising it on stream as a way for viewers to continue interacting with me and the community when I'm offline. Im a small streamer but I have a core group of dedicated viewers and they all love it and I've had more success getting people to join Discord than any of my social media. I believe it's still in Alpha but it's very functional and has a ton of great features with more coming.
Twitch,3drowh,Madhat_Gaming,2,Sun Jul 19 13:31:09 2015 UTC,"If you add moderators/admins and so on to your Facebook page, they may be able to see your personal profile.

Don't put all your social media handles on one panel-image (especially if they [handles] are different for each website). It requires retyping and lowers the chance that people will actually visit a profile."
Twitch,3drowh,redonculous,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:50:17 2015 UTC,I've added that into the main post. What I find to work best is just having a large Twitter logo with your handle underneath that people can click on to go to your Twitter - instead of a markdown link.
Twitch,3dufni,kevinelguapo,4,Sun Jul 19 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"For me I can't stand a lot of stuff on the screen. When I see a stream with follow list, sub list, chat, donation list, music info and cam, I normally go somewhere else unless the caster themselves seems interesting.  The above can work in retro consoles streams and such since the games are 4:3 and leave a lot of open space.  I don't mind popups that come in the fade away. I want to see the game and the caster, not a lot of info that just clutters the screen."
Twitch,3dufni,RiceWineVulpine,2,Sun Jul 19 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's perfectly fine so long as it's not huge. Text on screen is your only way to show appreciation to a follow or donation besides reading it, but making it take up a huge chuck of your screen just sucks.  Small as possible and out of the way is the best."

I agree with BurkeBlack's comment about making the text out of the way and not too big. If the text is huge and takes up the entire top half of your stream, then it's a turn-off for me as a viewer. I'd count that as not putting effort into making your stream look nice."

Twitch,3dtjt5,Skullkid442,2,Sun Jul 19 08:58:54 2015 UTC,"I have a blue yeti, and about four other active condenser mics to compare it against.  Value for money, for the purposes of recording voice audio from a computer, you really can't go past it.  For quality, I tend to use my Røde NT1-A whenever I get the chance, because the sound is just stunning.  It makes everything sound truly beautiful.  Also, it sits in a shock mount so desk vibration isn't going to carry through as easily.  However, for streaming it can be a bit more problematic because it's not USB.  It requires 48v phantom power, meaning you need an audio interface to run it.  Add in the cost of a Focusrite Scarlett Solo and an already-more-expensive option just became more .. expensiver.  Than it was before.  What I'm trying to say is that it's a lot of money.  The NT1-A unquestionably sounds better, but more often than not, I end up pulling out the Yeti, because it's super convenient.  Capture is a whole other beast.  One option that I'm quite fond of is sending my video through a home theatre receiver, as it has a Monitor output which sends a copy of the video out it.  That way, my gameplay isn't delayed by having active electronics in the path, and it can still farm off to a capture card easily.  I'm more Audio Guy than Video Guy though, so perhaps someone else can weigh in on a good in-line capture device.  Hope this helps."

One thing I will say for Røde is that their customer service is spectacular.  The people on the other end of the phone are experienced audio engineers with electronics backgrounds, and they've been able to help me more than a few times with really weird problems.  So if you plan to do anything unusual or quirky with your setup, that could be a good argument for their Podcaster range.  They're also super responsive on Twitter, if that's your thing."
Twitch,3dtjt5,mlanutti,2,Sun Jul 19 09:45:37 2015 UTC,"best streaming card would be the magwell, you get what u pay for with 700$ tho. streamers like silent sentry and lirik use this. other cards boast 1080p 60fps but in the fine print clearly state they dont , but the magwell truely does. a microphone is important you wouldn't want to cheap out on it"

I dont know if this makes me kinda weird but i dont care about 60fps, Im not trying to be the next big thing I just wanna stream from my consoles. Is it really that important with 1080p 60fps? On the microphone front im going to buy a yeti because its kinda cheap and good"
Twitch,3dtjt5,ggROer,2,Mon Jul 20 09:26:06 2015 UTC,"I have both a Blue Yeti and an AT2020, which I believe are the most common entry level Twitch streamer/YouTuber microphones. I personally prefer my AT2020 for a few reasons.  The Blue Yeti is a good microphone in sound quality. The issue is that if you want a boom arm, or a shock mount, you need to pay much extra to get ones that meet the specifications of the Yeti. The only desk arm I've found that can hold a Yeti is a PSA-1 which is a $100 desk mount arm (a Yeti is over 4 pounds, difficult to hold). The cheapest shock mount that I found that could hold a Yeti was a $45 one, and the official one runs you about $60.   The Yeti, like most of Blues products, is also very sensitive. It picks up a lot of ambient noise, like AC or showers nearby. If your keyboard is on the platform you are going to be using to type, you're going to have a difficult time without a shock mount (to avoid desk vibrations going to the stiff factory mount), and then there's also the issue that the keyboard will be closer to the mic on your desk.  I would personally only recommend the Yeti to someone who has multiple uses for it to get value out of the many different recording paterns that it comes with (omni-directional for example is good for interviews). As a YouTuber and a streamer I only used cardiod, which is what most people will do. I still paid for the other features, however, I never once in my life used them. This would be different if you made an array of content (skits, or live action vs gameplay only)  To me, the AT2020 picks up base better a little better, but otherwise sounds the same (while being slightly cheaper). It is less sensitive, and doesn't pick up background noise as much. It does come with a small starter stand, all the wires you need to plug in and go, and an attachment for a boom arm. It weighs about a pound making it easier to buy a boom arm for, and easier for transport, while still having a sturdy full metal body (like the Yeti). It is dark grey and matches most peripherals on the market. It may only be cardiod, but for game play this should absolutely be the option you use anyway!  I believe that although the Yeti is more flexible in dealing with multiple arrays of content creation, the AT2020 is the best bet for anyone creating game play content because of the lower price, smaller and more universally accepted body while having the same (if not, very slightly better) audio quality of the Yeti.  (With the Yeti, you're paying for all those audio patterns. If you're not going to use them, don't bother! And there is a reason why Blue makes their microphones strange sizes and shapes. To buy accessories to improve the Yetis audio quality, you're going to spend as much as the Yeti itself on Blue's brand of Yeti accessories.)  Edit for capture card: I have an Avermedia Live Gamer Hd and an Elgato. I would highly suggest the Live Gamer HD, if you have an extra PCI-E adapter in your computer if your computer NEEDS a capture card. I must admit, capture cards aren't what they used to be while having not fallen in price. I just use OBS nowadays."
Twitch,3dtjt5,SunnySplosion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:34:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with so much of what you said, even the sensitivity, however with the sensitivity you have noise gate to kill the ambient noise if you set it up properly, and since v11 of OBS-MP you have it included as well. But else I agree with everything, the Yeti may be overkill, but it is a solid product."
Twitch,3dtjt5,ggROer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:16:01 2015 UTC,"OBS has a noise gate meant for ambient noise and audio peaks, that is true, but sensitive mics don't only have ambient noise issues.   It will pick things up in your vocal range as well. Keyboard typing, mouse clicking. It's worse if you use the stand that it comes with!   Although I must agree, having a noise gate or, better yet, a limiter, help with sensitive microphones."
Twitch,3dtjt5,SunnySplosion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:37:11 2015 UTC,"True, I still use the standard stand and wish I had something to put it on, as well as a good fitting pop filter, those are I feel hard to find, good fitting ones that is."

I wouldn't have thought of it as piggy-backing off of Achievement Hunter at all, I think Let's Plays are their own huge thing now.  I kind of had an identity crisis earlier this year :) When I first started streaming, I really wanted to play Pokemon and used a ridiculous hand-drawn giant sketchy overlay of a Pokedex, but I found out quickly that the only way I was going to get viewers was if I streamed the newest version of Pokemon and I didn't have a capture card hahaha, AND that the overlay I was using may have been cute in the Pokemon art community but probably not on Twitch :) I also found that I had way more fun playing other games. Pokemon gets old.  Also, I don't really think my stream username matters much. It's silly, which is pretty reflective of how streaming goes for me haha, but in the end it's really just my internet alias.  Good luck with everything!!

Twitch,3dtfmz,Falco_77,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:56:18 2015 UTC,I've only been streaming a couple of months and I've been playing Payday and Dead Space so far. Play some games you enjoy and just see what you can do with them.
Twitch,3dtfmz,Hi_its_Zero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:37:17 2015 UTC,"Literally any game. Doesn't matter if its old or not. Dark souls works and lots of other games. New games and popular games like LoL, CS:GO have a large amount of streams and pro players as well who basically dominate the entire views. If you stream those kinda games you'll get buried since the pro players and the famous streamers are all in the top etc. Just look for any game that you enjoy and play it. And don't let the number of viewers effect you that much. a lot of today's streamers went through this phase. Most important advice i can offer is this: Always be consistent, play games you like and don't let the viewers and money be your number 1 concern. Trust me viewers will eventually come. Streaming is not easy, but you'll eventually get viewers if you stream normal games. And the most important thing of all is having fun while doing it! :D"

Twitch,3dtfmz,cenofett,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"""If you build it, they will come"" is my general philosophy when to all things Internet-related. I'm a SEO (search engine optimization) by-trade and content (with a focus on unique content) is king on any platform whether it's Google or Twitch. Just keep your chin, Rome wasn't built in a day. We have been streaming for a little over a month under our new channel pretty regularly, but haven't had more than maybe 7 or 8 viewers at any given time. We still have a ball regardless. We play games because we want to play games, having others join in is just an awesome side-effect."

Playing different games, guest stars, giveaways, an odd angle- all these things I look at as both a viewer and a streamer. I only have a finite amount of time to watch anything, so I would like to spend it watching something unique.   That being said, being comfortable is probably the most important to me. All great things stem from a good personality.  My personal philosophy on streaming is it's not so much the games you play, but you yourself that makes the difference. You will lose viewers with every change, this is true, but you will also gain new viewers every time too."

The Internet is far more complex than a simple 'i have x mbps so i can watch y quality'.  It's more like .. like a series of tubes.  No, scratch that, like a road system.  Sure, there's no-one on your street so you can drive down it easily, or to your neighbour (Netflix, Youtube) but perhaps the roads between your house and Twitch are congested.  Meanwhile, people on the other side of the congestion are saying ""idk man i can get there just fine"".  Except it's all invisible to the end user so all you see is ""that works and this doesn't"".  I spent ~12 years working on and maintaining the Internet infrastructure of Australia and all ISPs are certainly not equal, especially when it comes to International transit and peering.  It's Sunday here but I'll message you on your Tuesday to show you a few things you can do to help diagnose the problem.  None of them will actually help, but it may give you something to go back to your ISP with and say ""yo, goober - fix yo' shiz""."

Twitch,3dtc4a,Scrubterminator,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:46:53 2015 UTC,"I would recommend using your Elgato to stream but don't use the capture card software, instead download OBS and use that. The advantage to using a capture card with OBS is the amount of customization you have access to that neither the Twitch app or the Elgato software has. Although streaming from the app is a lot more user friendly, you won't be able to get the quality that OBS can. The biggest benefit to streaming off the app is that it can be potentially easier to get noticed because there is a front page spot dedicated to the top Xbox One streams and also your stream might be featured in the marketplace section of the particular game you're playing."

Twitch,3dsocv,Kamehameornah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:31:13 2015 UTC,You can use the elgato software on another screen and capture that entire monitor. Crop the interface out for OBs. You can record the raw elgato gameplay while you stream with your overlay in OBS.    Note: this is resource intensive.
Twitch,3dsocv,Laraeph,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:39:44 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Is this the only way to do it?
Twitch,3dsocv,Laraeph,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:31:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure for the Elgato, but my Avermedia program can also ouput the video in a borderless, overlayless player.

I had some minor Photoshop skills and always had an affinity for flat design. Luckily, Flat design is a hot commodity nowadays and fit in with our ""kinda"" angle. I just finished (for the most part) Our Website today as a matter of fact. I tried to give a unique color palette that would compliment the flatness of the design itself. Making the character pictures was a first for me (making a person in flat design) and I'm actually very happy with it.   All in all, the best advice I can give about self-promotion and graphics would be to design for the channel you want to convey, never compromise the spirit of what made you start the channel in the first place when it comes to design. If that means taking a few online course and watching tutorials in order to create a polished, unique art style- then so be it."

Overall the best way to find clients is to get involved in the community, people are more likely to hire you if they know you personally and you can start building your portfolio that way. Lastly, whenever I finish a commission I share the portfolio piece on Twitter to show my followers what I can do! This has been really helpful as well.

That said, I take breaks when needed and am not afraid to delay or shorten streams if I need to - I feel that streaming can burn you out if you do too much.

The longer I did it the more I began to fall in love with the community that began building in the chat, we even have this whole cannon with the main character I play in every game, Bloodaxe Thunderscream. It became something more than a pipe dream.  Recently, after discussion with my viewers, it was decided that a donation button would be good to plop right on there, and so I received my very first.

Twitch,3ds8th,PvPretender,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:44:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on your audience probably, or at least the style of your stream. For example it's obviously important to look ""clean"", hair brushed, nothing in your teeth, etc. After that it varies between persons.  For example on my stream I do no makeup or styled hair (beyond the fact I brushed it). This is because I want my stream to be very relaxed and chill-ish, especially since I stream before bed and often in pajamas. The only makeup I will wear is some to cover a giant red pimple if one is too appear. That being said it's up to you! If you feel more comfortable with some foundation on go for it, a streamer who's confident is an infinitely better streamer than one without."
Twitch,3ds8th,PvPretender,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:35:24 2015 UTC,you make a very good point I would prob put on a little just to cover my nose since it looks really red and for my hair I like to spike it up as it does make me feel more attractive rather than having it slumped over my face.
Twitch,3ds8th,PvPretender,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:42:35 2015 UTC,"I would say I depends.

I have the same problem, but It's kinda fixed with an HDMI Switcher. Either way, the problem is just that the computer doesn't know it's plugged in, you gotta unplug it and plug it back in, either the USB from the PC, or the other end of the USB cord in the elgato box.  What is happening is that you're trying to use a source that isnt connected(Even though it is, technically), and OBS crashes. For some reason, switching sources with an HDMI switcher makes the computer recognize it is plugged in, which I found out accidentally.  Also, make sure you're using OBS 32bit, elgato doesn't work with 64bit."

Other recommendations would to change your art to reflect your transition (like in your cover photo adding a little blurb like ""Now streaming on Xbox One). Try adding a similar blurb front and center on your panels to really drive the idea home. If you're on social media, a post every now and again could also really help."

Twitch,3dru3q,Derelium,2,Sat Jul 18 21:53:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think it is a ton of work, but there is definitely behind the scenes stuff. I'll share with you a few things that I do before stream.   I'm a woman, so first things first: hair and makeup. If my face/hair isn't on point, strangers will come into the stream and totally derail everything by making fun of what I look like. I have a thick skin and I don't take it personally, but it detracts from the conversation I am having with my viewers. Furthermore, my viewers get all upset at the jerk and come on we all just want to have fun. That's a half hour of time before every stream - I can't just use every day makeup because there are specific tricks to looking good on camera. I consistently review my streams to look at content, analyze down time, and consider my attitude and ability to communicate with my viewers. I plan events ahead of time in order to  make sure the stream is fun the second I get there. I don't want to pop up and think ""uh, what do I do now?""  I go to other streams to look at what they are doing, how they are behaving, and consider how I want to apply these things to my own stream. I gauge their popularity, the tone of their audience, and try to see why I think these things are happening. I also look for other new streamers to host. I browse through small channels and if I like what I see I host them. This sends over a couple of my viewers, but more importantly it makes the streamer feel special and happy. I remember how tickled I was the first time somebody hosted me. I felt so special all day, and I want to give that feeling to other people.  I try to be a constructive and useful member of the community here, because I want to help. I offer advice, read reviews, and use info from other people to improve my stream."
Twitch,3dru3q,bashella,2,Sat Jul 18 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"Yup, all of this and as another woman, make-up takes a good chunk of time.

Sometimes artwork for when I tweet out the stream. I usually only do this for special streams.

MOST broadcasters choose to not use them, but the option is there.  I wanted to address the folks who were ""annoyed and/or disappointed with Twitch"" in the comments.  First of all, Twitch never dictates what a partner can or cannot do with their own subscription product (outside basic Rules).  In every channel that has a subscription button, this is dictated by the broadcaster and ONLY the broadcaster.  As such, EVO dictated the $12 price tag as well as the paywall for source.    It should also be noted that the few folks who are saying ""Twitch/EVO is greedy"" must not know that 100% of the proceeds will go to the Evo Scholarship Fund.  This is a community funded initiative that gives Fighting Game players and fans the opportunity to send someone to college who otherwise couldn't.

I can certainly understand your dissatisfaction and that's probably why you don't see this with our non-esports broadcasters."
Twitch,3do1au,djWHEAT,23,Fri Jul 17 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"One of the worst things is that viewers are unable to express their dissatisfaction via the Twitch chat, which can normally be responded to by admins on a relatively quick basis. Putting the quality AND the chat behind the paywall just ensures that people who aren't happy are silenced. Awful practice and I cannot believe that EVO are doing this."
Twitch,3do1au,ShirtProtect,3,Fri Jul 17 23:15:47 2015 UTC,It forces people to go on twitter to complain about it which is a much more direct and easier place to express yourself to admins than twitch chat IMO.
Twitch,3do1au,Sonicrida,4,Sat Jul 18 03:50:52 2015 UTC,"Lets be honest. With that many people watching, the chat wouldn't be anything other than spam if it wasn't behind a paywall. Just go watch a League Of Legends eSports event and try to have an intelligent conversation about what's going on."
Twitch,3do1au,S1ayer,2,Sat Jul 18 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, CCP Games does a similar thing in regards to EVE Online's 'Alliance Tournament' and 'FanFest' stream events; you can watch, but to watch on Source quality you need to pay a small sum.  It sucks, but definitely not unusual."
Twitch,3do1au,Nomicakes,4,Sat Jul 18 04:15:40 2015 UTC,"I just don't see how this can help anybody. Making this a pay wall feature in general is just bad PR. Even though it is Evo's choice, as you can see, Twitch is going to get most of the blame for it regardless, due to implementing it as a feature.   It's just such a non-progressive thing to do. It's backwards thinking, like the Xbox One's resolution limitations, and console limitations in general. It's like the stupid things that companies like EA and Ubisoft do where you just implant your palm into your face and find it hard to fathom the thinking behind it.  The whole thing is just a ""What where they thinking"" moment."
Twitch,3do1au,Piku_Chan,7,Fri Jul 17 23:21:32 2015 UTC,No it's not a what were they thinking moment.  Evo does this every year.
Twitch,3do1au,plasticspoonn,8,Fri Jul 17 23:29:11 2015 UTC,This has been an EVO thing for years and its been around in Starcraft 2 as well for fucking ever.
Twitch,3do1au,aznheadbanger_,2,Sat Jul 18 03:13:53 2015 UTC,GSL paywalls medium quality. Be thankful for what you have.
Twitch,3do1au,Zebracak3s,-6,Sat Jul 18 07:35:10 2015 UTC,"Paywalling for Source is as bad as sub only chats (but nothing tops the connect to facebook to chat). The thing is most people will want to watch on Source if they have a nice big ass screen/tv and maybe want to chat to everyone in the chat about stuff and who knows... maybe make new eBuddies.  The flip side of this angry coin would be you can just simply pop out the video on High/Medium and just watch it casually or just have it there if you're doing other things (what I assume most people do anyways).  Option 2 would save you a popped vein and you can just be like ""Paywall? Meh, whateves"""
Twitch,3do1au,OutsanityDotCom,3,Fri Jul 17 23:16:11 2015 UTC,It's not even the actual video quality that makes this awful. 60FPS is a complete necessity when playing Street Fighter and watching it at anything less completely takes away from the experience
Twitch,3do1au,ShirtProtect,-1,Fri Jul 17 23:21:11 2015 UTC,Oh.... yeah 60fps and 1080p is overkill for viewers unless you have gigabit internet. That I never understood why people will do that unless it's for highlighting/exporting to YouTube purposes.
Twitch,3do1au,OutsanityDotCom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"They should just give us the option, even a trade-off would be nice.. I'd rather 480p at 60 compared to whatever 'high' is at the moment. A lot of games aren't dependent on FPS and that's fine but fighters are completely reliant on it"
Twitch,3do1au,ShirtProtect,0,Fri Jul 17 23:34:14 2015 UTC,True but the quality and fps of the stream is on the steamers settings. It would be interesting to see if it's possible to have quality options similar to YT when the video is like 4K and 60fps. Not sure that's possible for Twitch as it's live vs a recorded video
Twitch,3do1au,OutsanityDotCom,0,Fri Jul 17 23:40:07 2015 UTC,Oh.... yeah 60fps and 1080p is overkill for viewers unless you have gigabit internet.   Lol.
Twitch,3do1au,EnadZT,10,Sat Jul 18 12:35:45 2015 UTC,"Have you got any other examples of streams that go over the standard 4.99 sub price? And I have NEVER seen anybody paywall video quality, was this ever a feature? Or is this debuting on Evo right now? This is legitimately the first time many people have seen something like this, evidently by this whole situation. Twitch didn't do a very good job of telling people anything about this development.  Also, why would it matter who it goes to if it's mandatory? It's annoying. SGDQ does it right. I only care who it's going to if it's optional, why make it mandatory if it's a charity? Don't force me to pay for a charity to unlock something important like video quality. Doesn't it just make it a business if it's not a donation?  Then again, none of this would matter if Twitch's quality settings were actually useful. Bitrate scaling is fundamentally broken in all quality settings. None of them are feasible for any situation, which makes the people who aren't subbed to evo (majority of people) unhappy. Twitch's quality settings and Evo's incompetence is to blame. So it's irrational to say Twitch is blameless. Twitch development has been basically non-existent for a very, very long time."
Twitch,3do1au,Piku_Chan,13,Fri Jul 17 23:00:29 2015 UTC,"Here are a few examples of streams that have gone over the 4.99 sub price over the past 4 years:   GSL (2012-2015) FFX14 Fan Festival Killscreen Smite World Championships SOE LIVE 2014 WCS (StarCraft 2) Gearbox CCP Fest EVO (this is the 3rd time they have gone above the average sub price) NASL   I could keep going but I think you get the idea.  Regarding's EVO's decision to make it mandatory, that's something you'd have to take up with them, as mentioned in my original post, they are the sole decision makers on how they want to setup their ticket for the event (from price to quality options)."
Twitch,3do1au,djWHEAT,2,Fri Jul 17 23:08:59 2015 UTC,"Ok, sorry for the inconvenience by the way, I understand you aren't here all day to answer a single guy's questions.   But is the video quality paywall not a new feature? Because I'm sure there would be equal controversy if that was ever the case anywhere else, but I've never heard of that either."
Twitch,3do1au,Piku_Chan,3,Fri Jul 17 23:13:54 2015 UTC,It's no problem.  I just want to make sure people have the right information.    Video Quality Paywall was introduced back in 2012.  I could go into my channel right now and paywall Source for my subscription if I wanted to.  The reason you probably haven't heard about it (or seen it) is because it's NOT typical behavior from the broadcasters you see on a daily basis.  It's mostly adapted by Esports tournaments or big festivals who will wrap other benefits around subscription (i.e. The FF14 Fan Festival where subscribing also granted you a bunch of in-game items).    EVO actually did this last year as well.
Twitch,3do1au,djWHEAT,2,Fri Jul 17 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"Sure. But as the director of programming, don't you feel like this is eventually going to gimp Twitch as a platform?  If enough people use the feature that you implemented, then it'll be laughable when it becomes standard. Everybody laughs when the Xbone can only do 720p, everybody will laugh when major twitch streams can ""Only do high quality"", whereas competitors like Hitbox can do much better and haven't even implemented the feature to purposely gimp streams for cash."
Twitch,3do1au,Piku_Chan,2,Fri Jul 17 23:27:46 2015 UTC,"This product has been around for years. Again, its up to a broadcaster and most choose not to use it. If that were to suddenly change then of course, we would monitor, asses and re-address if needed."
Twitch,3do1au,Mucx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:45:10 2015 UTC,"One main problem I see is that paying $12 on one stream only allows for that one stream to be unlocked for higher quality. There's currently 6 srkevo(x) streams up with various viewer counts and games. If you subscribe to one, it doesn't affect any other evo streams, just that one. I get the paywall and I understand that it's been done by primarily esports streams before (OGN and GSL are the ones I've personally ran into) but having 6 streams up, all behind a separate $12 paywall it's kinda silly. Would be nice to have a ""all access"" sub or something.  Edit: Please tell me if subscribing to one steam allows access to all source quality evo streams, because when I click on source, it says ""Subscribe to EVO 2015!"". I could see that unlocking all the streams, but I'm not willing to pay $12 to experiment with it (Mainly because I'm not even interested in watching them, I just think this is a issue that should be brought up).   Edit x2: Clarified by /u/MellowNebula below my post!"
Twitch,3do1au,Ehaw,5,Sat Jul 18 01:59:46 2015 UTC,It's a Team Subscription and should provide you with subscriber benefits across all channels within the team. Just like with the ESL team.

Twitch,3do1au,Zebracak3s,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:36:20 2015 UTC,"GSL actually paywalls High and Source, I believe. $12 for 4 channels and 3 days of quality streams, thats a beer at some places. Choose your battles, I don't think we need to be raging about donations to a scholarship fund. If its a problem, watch on high, which actually looks pretty decent imo."
Twitch,3do1au,amokie,2,Sat Jul 18 13:25:36 2015 UTC,Reckful was asking for a $2.99 sub cost not too long ago and a Twitch admin came into his channel and told him that it wasn't going to happen.
Twitch,3do1au,lolatredditors,3,Sat Jul 18 00:54:42 2015 UTC,"It's because anything lower than $2.99 is not something that is supported. The few channels that have this are grandfathered (Maybe 3 channels, 2 of them being active)."

For games live MVC3 this isn't enough, at least not with the current encode settings. You end up with video that looks very ""pixelated"" because of the constraints on the encoding end.  I was wondering if it would be possible, if EVO organizers were to request it, to change the default bitrate of the transcodes. Let's say they wanted the high preset to run at a higher bitrate then what it is currently running at, would you guys have the possibility to actually change that?"

Twitch,3do1au,Inoka1,5,Sat Jul 18 04:22:05 2015 UTC,These type of paywalls have been around for a long time but $12 does seem extreme.

I was just saying that they haven't done this for like 9 months now"
Twitch,3do1au,plasticspoonn,3,Sat Jul 18 02:01:51 2015 UTC,"Koreans do it because its part of their culture. They've been doing paywall stuff for like 4 years now for high+ quality.  EVO's doing it because they can't monetize in any other way mainly because they have been snubbing ""esports"" and talking about their ""grassroots"" for all these years that most sponsors no longer want to offer lucrative deals.   Still though without a different streaming platform to compete with Twitch (youtube Live), and no other major gaming tournament for the FGC, they will get away with this with almost no repercussions. They'll probably get at least 1000 subs over this weekend and everyone else will still watch via high. Its not much money but then again EVO never had much money to begin with otherwise they would offer a lot more in their prize pool and have major sponsors like every other esport."

Twitch,3drk77,streambritish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:53:19 2015 UTC,2 separate internet connection on each pc? That's very cool if you have capacity to have a  whole line just for your streaming pc :)  - Yeah would be cool - that way any streaming congestion isn't going to impact your game-play and visa-versa.
Twitch,3dq4nx,OneCoolZombie,2,Sat Jul 18 10:29:22 2015 UTC,I usually just stream what I want. The viewers come and go but the main thing for me is that I have fun doing it. People will feel your energy.

Twitch,3dq4nx,Dejawon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:40:38 2015 UTC,I stream games that i enjoy. you should do the same don't stream a game you don't like.
Twitch,3dq4nx,Craftablee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:38:42 2015 UTC,"You're pretty much right. I'm not the streaming master as I'm in the same situation you're in, only been streaming for 6 days.  What I can tell you is if I want viewers I can't play certain games. Would I LIKE to play CS:GO? Yeah I really would, but realistically I won't get viewers. Who is going to scroll down 3 pages to find my stream? Very few people. If you're willing to take that huge risk don't strategically pick the games you play.  If you want to sway the odds in your favor there's a little bit that you can do. I chose a past title that A) I'm good at B) I enjoy and C) has OK following with like 3-4 other people streaming it. In the past week of just starting streaming 140 follows have come my way and like 12-15 people frequent my channel (not all at once).  Something else I've found is if you start with that title that brings in the viewers and they LIKE you and your stream they will stay when you switch games. So just because you start off the day playing the title you originally chose doesn't mean you're always tied to that game. Of course some people will just leave, but whatever. All you can do is put in your best effort to make them stay!  Hope this helps. I'll be sure to stop by your channel sometime."
Twitch,3dq4nx,korrupt_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:56 2015 UTC,"I believe that streaming games you dont like just to get viewers will make you come out as someone you are not. This is because you are going to be ""faking"" enjoying the game and having fun with, so in a way you are not being who you are. This is just my opinion im not saying that  about you, its just how i would feel if i did it.  Now if you stream games that you enjoy and like playing than that will be the real you. Viewers will come and go of course and maybe you wont get as much as before but those that do stay will be staying mostly cause of you and your personality so i feel its the best way to go.  But of course the each his own. Good luck on your streaming adventures and i hope you do great."

Twitch,3drfjn,DrakenZA,3,Sat Jul 18 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"What would stop someone from starting in a game with no other streams and switching games after getting transcoding? It's a nice thought, but it could never work because people would abuse it."
Twitch,3drfjn,TheXseption,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:11:41 2015 UTC,"People who would abuse that would most likely just get 20 bots into their Stream and get transcoding like that, i dont think Streamers are as concerned about quality levels as viewers are.  Ive seen viewers using bots lately to just get streams up over 30 so they can get quality settings etc."
Twitch,3drfjn,TheXseption,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:28:01 2015 UTC,"If this was in place, it would be 10x easier and more accessible for people to abuse than botting for transcodes. Twitch just doesn't have the resources to give transcoding to every streamer, and they aren't going to create a way for people to abuse them and use up the resources they do have available. Because they are limited, Twitch gives transcodes to partners and then the rest are given to those with the most audience, and that means that the largest amount of viewers possible can have transcodes on the streams they're watching. Giving transcodes to someone even not abusing the system, in a small game, with less than 30 viewers means that a less than optimal amount of viewers are able to view with quality options. Example: Twitch can handout transcodes to 100 streams. 100 games are also live. That means that only the top person in each game gets transcodes. In 20 of these games the top streamer has less than 20 viewers. In the top game, everyone on the first page has over 100 viewers. Those people with over 100 viewers aren't getting quality options, yet people with 20 viewers are just because they are the only ones streaming a game. This is an extreme example, but it demonstrates why this would be a bad idea."
Twitch,3drfjn,TheXseption,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"Im pretty sure twitch can handle way more than 100 streams as once, it already starts auto transcoding non partners at 30 viewers, its transcoding a lot more than 100 streams at a time for sure."
Twitch,3drfbl,SKS81,3,Sat Jul 18 19:02:25 2015 UTC,"Secondary monitor is the most common solution, i think...   That's what i do anyways. Makes it really easy to read chat and reply quickly."
Twitch,3drfbl,awkwardwildturtles,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:29:13 2015 UTC,I mean allocating space for it on my streams and then the highlights I make after it. I already have 2 monitors.
Twitch,3drfbl,awkwardwildturtles,2,Sat Jul 18 22:32:34 2015 UTC,Oh. If it blocks stuff on your screen then there's no way around it really... maybe make the chat window a bit shorter heightwise?
Twitch,3drfbl,tduva,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:36:00 2015 UTC,Yeah that is what someone else suggested. I guess I was just in love with the idea of trying to put a lot on there.
Twitch,3drbek,scapeman1231,8,Sat Jul 18 18:29:33 2015 UTC,Pros:  -- People will sub to you so they can chat  -- Your chat will be way under control  -- Practically no trolls  Cons:  -- People will call you a sell-out  -- Loyal viewers who don't have money to spend may get frustrated and turn on you
Twitch,3drbek,AnEternalEnigma,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:43:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on the type of stream you're after I think - Some streamers just want all hell to break loose in their chat and are fine with it (Forsenlol, Sodapoppin etc), whereas others like 'more order' (Lirik etc). I think it probably depends on your amount of subs, because if you only have a few chat is going to be fairly quiet (unless that's what you're after). It does encourage people to subscribe though. I think people like chatting but they aren't really put off by sub mode, and some streamers physically cannot read chat without it on, so if you're going for interaction during peak times it's probably a good idea, and then you can always disable it when less people are watching or towards the start/end of your stream"
Twitch,3drbek,Ramautso,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:42:45 2015 UTC,"Agree with what /u/AnEternalEnigma said. But you have to understand that you won't be able to interact with every single person on a personal level and you're sure as hell not going to read every message in the chat, especially with a larger number of people in your chat. I have about 10 people in my chat, and it's hard to read all thos messages. That's something that your viewers should know or try to understand... remember the main focus of your stream is the gameplay, right?"
Twitch,3drbek,drewlinskii,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:07:53 2015 UTC,First of all: I have never subbed to a channel on Twitch  I think streams going sub-only (only chat!) is completely fine. Maybe not always but like on specific days. People sub to a channel to support it and imo they should get a few extra things in return. I really don't mind it as long as the chat is not completely dead (Chat still is part of the twitch experience).
Twitch,3drbek,echodev,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"I agree! if there are 50 viewers and only 5 are allowed to chat, it's actually quite lame. I've never subbed either, and I usually just put streams on my TV anyways and neglect chat so I guess I'm somewhat of a lurker anyways, but I wouldn't ever be turned off from content just because I can't chat.   good content is good content. it's hard to find and if im entertained by the streamer, I don't really care."
Twitch,3drbek,-SpitE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:25:05 2015 UTC,"I wish Twitch had a sub-only mode where if you've ever subbed to any channel before you're able to chat.  This accomplishes the same thing as sub-only, but doesn't give the stigma where it's ""pay to chat"" necessarily."
Twitch,3drbek,schizo01,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:09:40 2015 UTC,"That sort of idea kind of defeats the purpose of it. That's $5 to be able to talk in chat regardless. If a streamer says they want to start doing sub only chat, a bunch of people will ultimately subscribe in a clump and then the number of subs would go down to however much it was and then sub only mode for the motive of control is eliminated."
Twitch,3drbek,Monkeylarry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:11:52 2015 UTC,"I really don't like it, in general I just don't watch streams that use it. I think sub-only is something that should only be used in special cases (like bots overrunning chat, sub-only giveaways, spoilers!).   Chat is such a big part of Twitch that blockading it hugely impacts the way viewers can watch your stream. I can understand it's hard to keep interacting with chat while playing a game, it's just that it  is not something I like to see fenced-off for the in-crowd. Everyone started out as a new viewer, meeting the streamer and the community, sub-only chat places a big threshold right at the beginning of that.  Of course it all depends on the streamer/the mods, on chat activity and on the people in your chat."
Twitch,3drbek,Another_Bernardus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:04:02 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't spend much time on a channel that requires sub to chat. I'm not ashamed to say that I want attention from the streamer. Not a lot but if I like someone's channel, I like being able to say hello and chat with them and the community.  The occasional sub-only day is fine if it's clearly flagged. In general, if I encounter a stream that always wants me to pay to say hello, I'm just gonna move on to someone else."

I was streaming some Witcher3 the other day straight from the ps4 and I got excited because it said I had 5 viewers (the most I've had so far haha). I went to check my dashboard at one point and it showed only me.
Twitch,3dr6ys,Vaderzer0,2,Sat Jul 18 19:33:39 2015 UTC,Yeah i got excited because i had 7 on my first stream but when i checked the website it said i only had 3. It seems that it only shows the greatest number of viewers you had at 1 time.

Twitch,3dqosn,Falco_77,2,Sat Jul 18 15:02:48 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/Falco_77,  Here are the recommended specifications for a PC that is gaming/streaming or simply a streaming PC, or if you simply want to upgrade a part.   Each section will go a little bit into detail about why each component is important.     CPU:  You will want to go with the best CPU you can. Ideally that is where most of your PC build budget is spent. Due to how streaming works, the CPU is the most important part.   General recommendations for CPU's:    Any of the following or newer Intel Core i7 CPU's, with better ones in descending order.  Core i7 2600k Core i7 3770k Core i7 4770k Core i7 4790k Core i7 5820k Core i7 5930k Core i7 5960x   AMD CPU's are not recommended for streaming as they have very low IPC(Instructions-per-clock) performance. A top-of-the-line AMD 8350 CPU will perform as well or maybe worse as a i7 2600k, a 4 year old Intel CPU.     Ram:  Ram is not very important when streaming. Typically, when using a program like OBS, no more than 500MB will be used. Of course, this may very depending on the amount of source, plugins etc.   General recommendation for ram:    8GB DDR3 or higher     GPU: The GPU is the next most essential part of streaming. Popular programs like OBS, Xsplit and others perform actions on the GPU, like compositing, which is when the game video, webcam video, overlays, etc are all mixed into one picture, and scaling, which when your stream is converted from 1080p to 720p. Other actions include anti-alising, which can be applied after scaling to increase the quality, and other effects.   General recommendation for GPU:    Nvidia - Any GTX 650 series or higher (700, 900)  AMD - Any Radeon 6850 series or higher (7000, R7, R9)     Thats pretty much it. Other parts like the case, power supply, motherboard and hard drive is up to you, as they do not make a huge difference. If you will be doing lots of recordings and/or recording your streams, a 2TB or 4TB HDD would be beneficial to your build.   Cheers,  -Royal"

Twitch,3dqosn,catdragonnamedrose,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:42:16 2015 UTC,"You have a good GPU, depending on what motherboard you have upgrading the CPU would be more efficient for streaming."
Twitch,3dqgc7,catdragonnamedrose,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:28:15 2015 UTC,I'm going to do an upgrade probably this winter this is the case motherboard and power supply i'm thinking about getting. With power supply look up how much power your gpu takes and add 400 watts and that's the minimumish number of watts you want for your power supply.
Twitch,3dqgc7,RaN96,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:58:52 2015 UTC,"I'd go with a different case honestly. The 650D is pretty old at this point. The 450D, 550D, 750D are newer and have more updated features. That and the 650D has a few issues. 1 being the hard drive cage being sort of cheap and there's no noise dampening on the cage so any loud HDD will make a lot of noise. And the front fan is prone to start making a whining noise that's incredibly annoying.  Source: previous 650D owner."
Twitch,3dqgc7,catdragonnamedrose,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:20:00 2015 UTC,i think when i looked newegg didn't have the 750D case but i might just buy the case elsewhere so i can get that case.

Twitch,3dqgc7,RaN96,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:20:56 2015 UTC,"the case you just want something that will give you good airflow and a case that will be easy to build in. The motherboard i just choose because it's a decent one in my price range and i can have the cpu, gpu, and ram i want."
Twitch,3dqgc7,LtRoyalShrimp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:30:55 2015 UTC,thanks. i'll take a look at those!

Twitch,3dqbx1,Aldaz108,2,Sat Jul 18 12:28:36 2015 UTC,"I have the same specs as you except I'm running a gtx 970 currently.   It is 100% capable of streaming and playing demanding games.   The only thing I've noticed is that if I'm streaming something that's fairly heavy on CPU I lose a couple of fps (we are talking like 80-90 down to 60)  Your mileage may vary a bit due to graphics card differences but overall that machine will do really well for streaming. You don't need the 16 GB, just get 2x4 GB and upgrade to 16 later if you feel like. Don't get a single stick of 8 GB as it will run slower than 2x4 due to the two sticks running dual channel.   8 is perfectly sufficient for gaming and streaming and web browsers open, music playing etc. 16 would give you plenty of buffer space and keep you good for the absolute newest games that may use a bit more ram.   You will also be able to play on a slower preset (I use fast personally, at a 2k bitrate and 30 fps 720p obs uses about 19% CPU)  One thing to be aware of is the i7-4790k with a stock cooler runs HOT. get an aftermarket cooler, or be willing to turn off turbo boost (that's what I did) until you get one. So my CPU is only running at 4.0 GHz and doesn't boost up to 4.4 under load, keeping temps much more reasonable.   Good luck, you'll love it :)"

Twitch,3dq2nu,ErinMyLungs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:18:07 2015 UTC,Processor: AMD A10-7850K APU  Graphics Card: Sapphire Radeon R7 260X 2GB  RAM: 8GB  Here are screenshots of Encoding and Advanced.  http://gyazo.com/6d5d39b0df94dac77e89f369a8734414 http://gyazo.com/4b8a9063bc2d6c1ffda5d9ad37d95f13
Twitch,3dq2nu,ErinMyLungs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:13:43 2015 UTC,"Can you give a screenshot of video settings as well?  So a couple things I'm thinking about. Your bitrate might be too low to look good. What's your upload speed? If you can sustain 2000 kb/s bitrate, it'll help improve the quality. The less bitrate you can maintain, the harder you need to run your CPU to get equivalent quality. On the flip, higher bitrate can compensate for a less-powerful CPU.  So I'd highly recommend increasing your bitrate to start. Your CPU is somewhat underpowered for streaming, but glancing around on the net says you might be able to pull off 720p30fps assuming your network isn't a problem. Also don't go overboard on it, 1800-2200 kb/s is optimal for 720p30fps.  Another thing to do is try and change the preset to veryfast, superfast, or ultrafast. I'd honestly guess that superfast or ultrafast will be pretty important on those. Encoding at slower speeds takes a ton more processing power (I have an i7-4770 and probably could stream most games on medium for 720p30fps). If your stream performance isn't a problem, then don't fiddle with this too much.  Also I cannot recommend enough decreasing your broadcast resolution to 720p. Either through downscaling in the video settings or just running everything at 720p. It's very hard to push 1080p/60fps or 1080p/30fps if you're not a partner because you need very high bitrate to keep the visual quality looking good. You might even consider downscaling further. It's less intensive and requires a lower bitrate to look good.  If you want to get a little bit crazy or weird, you might want to try the xsplit free version and try out using AMD's VCE hardware encoder. It's similar to shadowplay for Nvidia cards and quicksync on igpus for intel's iX processors. I think this is definitely worth looking into for you! the integrated graphics on your APU can totally run the hardware encoder and your graphics card also is able to do it! This'll lower your CPU overhead and might give you the smooth 30 fps you want although it does come at a cost of quality. x264 CPU encoding looks better for streaming, but it requires a much stronger CPU. Check out this thread and the youtube video there, it might be worth looking into. If you can't upload 2k+ kb/s, then I'd keep working on tweaking your x264 settings.  I looked into possible CPU upgrades but unfortunately the FM2+ socket doesn't have much and none of them worth it. The A10-7870K would be a minor upgrade, but I don't think it'll help for the ~150 dollar US investment. You could get a new mobo and snag an FX-6300 for about 200, but you mention on your page that you're trying to save up for other basic things like a webcam, so I'm guessing you probably don't have the scratch to upgrade your PC. If you want, check out /r/hardwareswap and you might find someone with a CPU+Mobo combo that they'd be willing to sell pretty cheap!  Also I followed you on twitch! I was watching one of your sleeping dog videos and laughed really hard at this one goofy scene. Good luck!"

Twitch,3dq2nu,ErinMyLungs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:43:54 2015 UTC,"if it's not too much of a burden, your upload speed is quite slow for streaming fast paced action style games. an upload speed of anything over 3MBPS is ideal for these so you can increase your bitrate.  games that are fast paced where what's on the screen is constantly changing require a little bit higher bitrate to look smooth. thinks like hearthstone where there isn't a lot of stuff on the screen moving look fine at a low bitrate, so that could be bottle necking your stream too"

A lot of times I couldn't hear you over the game. There was a few times there would be a lot of dead air when you were concentrating on something like picking a lock (I still struggles with that) and when you would be reading something on the screen. For the reading maybe read out loud. Not sure what the blue bar is for at the bottom of the screen. It was empty and just covered part of the screen. That's just a small thing.  I would just crank up the mic volume and keep at it. Your still really new and can take a long while to start pulling in some viewers. Just keep at it.

Twitch,3dovkz,aselhd,2,Sat Jul 18 01:51:38 2015 UTC,check that your not dropping frames. Also make sure when your streaming your fps isn't dropping on obs.  If it is reconfigure settings to be less intensive on your cpu (use quicksync or nvidia.)

Twitch,3dpfrq,Oremm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"Ok - looks like you might be pushing the CPU just a tad too hard.

Twitch,3dpdcv,TheOriginalKiiD,2,Sat Jul 18 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"avermedia.  Black magic intensity (and their pro line) are not designed to work with capturing computers or consoles, however they can.  because of this, it flat out may not work at all for you, as was my case. the support rep told me that. they are designed more for capturing HD cameras.  I went with the avermedia c985 (live gamer HD) internal card after returning the blackmagic intensity pro and have been super happy with it. I am not familiar with their external cards, however.  the avermedia live gamer portable is usb 2.0, so you'll still have the delay. I would strongly advise getting an internal card over usb if you can do it, because the delay is usually 300-500 milliseconds.  I don't know of any usb 3.0 capture cards, but that would reduce the delay and be the next best thing if you cant get an internal card"
Twitch,3dpdcv,distortednet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:48:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with the Avermedia cards.  The Avermedia live gamer HD supports a lot more resolutions then the Blackmagic Intensity Pro (non 4K). Mainly 1080p 60fps which can be good for later use if you make a stream box for PC gaming. Granted the card is only HDMI.  The Blackmagic card can be good for streaming consoles, but it's a bit limited on the resolutions it supports. PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii work great, but if you wanted to do NES, SNES or anything in the retro time frame it will not support it. The Blackmagic does have some issues with it settings in Xsplit, but that is more of Xsplit issue and is in its known issues list.  I know the Avermedia live gamer extreme is USB 3.0 and actually captures 1080p 60fps, but have never tested one. So no Idea on a delay with it.  I have two of the Avermedia live gamer HDs and they work great. Really easy to setup and use in both OBS and Xsplit.  I have a Blackmagic Intensity Pro (old non 4K one) and it does ok. I use it mainly for my camera since I use Xsplit and can't really change its settings real well."

Twitch,3dnb75,RiceWineVulpine,3,Fri Jul 17 17:46:04 2015 UTC,"Streaming at a constant time is a big one. It doesn't have to be every day, but if you can show viewers that you'll stream at a certain time on certain days every week, it can help build your stream up as an item in their weekly routine.  Otherwise, just keep on keeping on. Games like Hearthstone and League are hard to break into (especially nowadays), but as long as you keep pushing along, you'll build up a dedicated group."

I mean there's a few things you'd need to consider like how often you stream, if it's consistent, and is the quality overall good (which isn't really that hard to accomplish), but if you're only averaging 8 viewers after 4 years then something is off for sure.

For some reason it is really eerie and I think it takes away from some of the gestures you make--I watched part of your rocket league stream, so lots of emotion there that I think was missed. I doubt this is really costing you viewers but my initial thought was that it was weird and hard to watch a floating head play video games. I think it takes away from that ""real person"" connection people enjoy so much on Twitch.   P.S. Silly people are saying things like ""keep a schedule"", etc. when if they take a minute to view your profile it's right there.

The chromakey shirt is probably going to stay tbh, I like it, it's at least a little bit unique, and I don't have to worry about covering up UI elements as much with it. There have been enough people who love it that I think it's worth.  As a note, my schedule is also literally right in your face if you go to my channel as it's my offline screen image :D  Having seen what you did though, would you agree or disagree with assessment that I'm doing most things ""right""?

I was only able to watch the Tales of Graces VOD, but I agree that it took away from any hand gestures that may have otherwise helped to convey emotion. In this particular stream session, the energy felt a little low. I didn't get the sense that you were really having fun, so as a viewer it's hard for me to have fun. But maybe you totally were! Conveying that to your audience may be harder depending on the game type, but it helps keep things engaging.

The floating head cast thing seems to be a little bit of a polarizing opinion, there have been people who have lived it, others who think it's maybe offputting (though I have had some who initially said that but stuck around for a while after anyways). My hands are still there so I figured that was probably still enough, and I personally feel like most of emotional response comes from the face anyways, and I'd rather have you see as much of the screen as possible and not worry about covering up UI elements.  As for not having fun, it's actually maybe a little possible, depending on which Graces VOD you were watching. The game near the end was wearing on me quite a lot to the point where I was just... mad at the game, so it's possible that's what was coming across, just kinda wanted it to be over already. Probably didn't help that it was the 4th straight JRPG I had played in a row which are generally notorious for having the dumbest characters/plotlines :D  But thank you for the feedback either way, I will keep it in mind!"

I know since you only have 5 viewers that it might be tougher, but go to the top 5 and see if what the lowest persons viewer count is. if it's under 40, I leave it followed. if it's over 40, I unfollow that game. also, it's important to keep an eye on those games during the times you would be streaming them to see how big the channels are that you would be up against.  next, I try a few of these games out. this week I tried one game out for 5 days. it went amazing! definitely gonna try that one out later to see if the impact was random or not.  only take note of games that you would actually want to play. if you don't actually want to play, you're going to look bored or unexcited on stream and people probably won't stick around."
Twitch,3dnb75,-SpitE,2,Fri Jul 17 23:06:24 2015 UTC,"This is what I did.  Made a schedule and try to stick to it. Being consistent really helps in building an audience.  Pick 1 game you think you can play for a long period of time and designate one of your stream days JUST to that game. Example, I stream Tuesdays and Thursdays. Thursday is a guaranteed XCOM: Long War day, while Tuesday is a ""whatever the hell I want"" day.  That way, people who want variety know to tune in on Tuesday. People who want XCOM know I'll be playing it on Thursday."

If it's a multiplayer game, maybe you guys can stream together and share an audience. Help each other out. Just an idea!"
Twitch,3dnb75,sodakite,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:24:49 2015 UTC,I started doing this:   Pick a game that interest you that are in the 100-1000 view range and roll that in to your game rotation. Start asking your viewers for ideas what they want to see. A schedule is good and being consistent with the times you go live will help.

Twitch,3docyt,SirPoofius,4,Fri Jul 17 22:31:50 2015 UTC,"Emotes are approved by an actual person, they check to make sure the emote doesn't violate the TOS and also if the image is copyrighted. The person approving it probably didn't know it was a copyrighted image being used, and they caught it after the fact. Also, if the image is different enough like Witwix's emotes they are approved since it isn't an exact copy of the copyrighted work. I'm a partnered Pokemon streamer myself and I know of others who have emotes with copyrighted images too, but they simply haven't been caught yet, or Twitch determined that they were different enough to be approved."

Twitch,3dmpei,Zaalie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:53:28 2015 UTC,"Go in with a plan. Have a schedule set for yourself, it really helps. Obviously go with the flow depending on how ya feel, but a general idea of what you're going to play helps. I did Valve games last night. Next will probably be Ratchet and Clank series, or KH, or Jak and Daxter.   I purchased a small brita pitcher a couple weeks ago, I don't have to get up as often to get a drink, so I don't get parched from talking to my viewers for...like...12 hours straight. So I'd definitely suggest that.   Same general rules of streaming apply, make sure you're having fun first and the rest will follow easily.  Unless the persona you've made for yourself is gruff and antisocial greet everyone with a smile. People will be much more likely to stay if they know they can just relax and watch someone play a game and chat.  Also, take breaks. 5-10 minutes every hour or two, that way you won't burn yourself out. I can't stress this enough, I don't think I would have been able to make it through a 10pm-10am stream if I didn't stretch my legs every couple hours."

By the last third you are going on an autopilot, spaced out. Getting rid of the accumulated exhaustion takes quite a bit of time and I don't mean one long-ass 16 hour sleep.  It's really exciting, but can't be done too often or you will hate yourself."

Twitch,3doccm,GrrrlStyleNow,5,Fri Jul 17 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"Play something that you love, and isn't in the top 10 games on Twitch.  Ignore the numbers, because they won't be pretty (at first).  Talk like you're doing a Let's Play, or a pre-recorded show. Treat chat interaction like a special treat, because it won't always be around.  Build a schedule of streams, and stick with it. If you can't guarantee that you'll make at least 75% of the streams at that time, don't put it on the schedule.  Have fun!"
Twitch,3doccm,Shado_Temple,2,Fri Jul 17 22:37:12 2015 UTC,"This is perfect advice right here, I couldn't have said it better myself. I think all of us who are becoming successful with Twitch didn't do so until we became consistent and set a schedule for ourselves. Its a huge part."
Twitch,3doccm,BouseFeenux,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:57:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's interesting, I had kinda assumed that if you were chasing numbers playing a top ten game would have been a good idea.  I don't think I'll be in much danger of that though, since my favourite games rarely show up there, and I want to play a lot of nostalgia titles."
Twitch,3doccm,Shado_Temple,2,Fri Jul 17 22:53:33 2015 UTC,"It's a pitfall a ton of new streamers fall into, and it's completely understandable as to why. I explained this in detail in a previous post; the following is an excerpt (albeit with more sass than what your current question calls for):  The reason why you won't see growth occur while playing these games is because by streaming them (and for a lot of you, only them), you're throwing yourself into the deepest holes on Twitch. We get it! There are a lot of people watching these games, and you figured you could nab a small slice of that viewer pie, rocketing yourself to stardom in a few streams. The trouble is, so did the other hundreds of folks who are sitting at the bottom of the stream list at any given time. When you search for a game (say, LoL, for example), the list of streamers broadcasting said game are ordered from most viewers to least. That means the top 10 streamers for that game are listed first, and have 75%+ of the viewership as a result. If you're just starting off (aka 0-1 viewers or so) a random passerby would have to scroll through hundreds of channels doing the same thing you are just to get to you; why in the hell would they when there are obviously popular channels before yours that people have already flocked to, thus proving their ""value""?  Plenty of patient regulars here have tried to tell you all that you've got to get away from these saturated games, and they're not saying it for shits and giggles. If you want to get out of that single-digit (or single-viewer) rut, you have to branch out, and try smaller games. Yes, they won't have the thousands of potential viewers the big games do, but suddenly you'll be fighting for attention in a certain game against a handful of other streams, instead of 500+. You can always try going back to those big games after you build an audience."

Twitch,3dp1mz,gweeds,3,Sat Jul 18 02:12:20 2015 UTC,You might be able to do it with Dxtory. It allows capturing audio and mic is separate audio channels. With the VoIP audio you might need to look into VAC to be able to separate the VoIP and Game audio.
Twitch,3dp1mz,RiceWineVulpine,2,Sat Jul 18 02:28:15 2015 UTC,The only problem with that is the extra processing power to record/stream/encode with obs plus the same with dxtory. (minus the streaming for dx)
Twitch,3dp1mz,BastionConquers,3,Sat Jul 18 02:34:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would add a lot of stress on the system.  Might not be the best way, but a way that it could be done."

As a quick test, if you happen to have an iPhone earbuds with the microphone built in... plug them into your Mac.  It should work.  To get it to work with a gaming headset, you just have to buy an adapter to split the line in from the line out.  The cable you need is a 3.5mm TRRS (Male) to 2x 3.5mm TRS (Female).  I'd link one for you, but I'm sitting on the subway in New York City right now—cell service isn't fantastic.    The question now is how to get the audio from the headset to your Mac and the Xbox One at the same time.  Possible, but you'll have competing voltages... so you'll need a transformer of some sort.  Lemme do some more research when I get better cell service and I'll get back to you."

Twitch,3dn9fu,Actionfrank315,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:56:29 2015 UTC,"Alright I'm back.  The adapter you need is something like this.  This will enable you to use a standard PC headset with your Macbook Pro.    The other half of the issue is getting the microphone audio to both your Mac and your XB1 at the same time.  On the surface this isn't a problem, as you can just split the signal with a cable like this.  However, both the Xbox Controller and the Mac are providing what they call bias voltage.  Bias voltage, which is 2-5 volts DC in this situation, is what powers the electret microphone.  Powering the mic from both the Xbox Controller and the Mac isn't a good idea.  The solution is to use a transformer or a capacitor, which will block the 5V DC from one of the devices.  BUT, I can't find one.  You could make one fairly easily... but you'd have to be handy with electrical circuits and soldering."
Twitch,3dn9fu,Actionfrank315,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"I've soldered at work but I don't have the necessary equipment to do that.  Thanks for the help though.

If I were trying to set you up on a budget, since I started exactly where you are now (with a 2010 MBP to be honest), I picked up a Blue Snowball USB mic. ~$50 and can produce a great voice over track. On the flip side, you could get a splitter for your XB1 chat adapter and run that into your Elgato. I've been toying with this idea to pick up my party chat, but haven't gotten around to trying it myself. Doing it this way would/should put your commentary on the same audio track as the game audio though, if I understand how it works properly, so be prepared for that. With the snowball, you'd have a separate track that you can mix independently of the game audio, which makes editing for YouTube a lot easier."

This card will capture 720p60 or 1080p30 to your hard drive. It does have 1080p60 pass through however. (I have my 985 running into my El Gato HD60 so I can capture at 1080p60 and also have no input lag for my stream)  It sounds like you are using one monitor? You should be able to do the resizing window thing with this card. Bring the C985 in as a video source into OBS or Xsplit, then resize the window/viewport to your liking. You can also just fullscreen it, and then adjust those playlist or messages by stepping out of full screen, that way you can enjoy all of your monitor without having to switch sources :)"
Twitch,3dnko2,SwingPoynt,2,Fri Jul 17 19:14:08 2015 UTC,"You can RECORD @ 720/60 AND 1080/60  You can STREAM @ 720/60 AND 1080/30.  There is a clear delay (~200-300 ms), so if you were to play on a preview screen, it's VERY difficult."
Twitch,3dnko2,Blacerrr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:39:57 2015 UTC,"I know that OBS will have a clear delay (it never was to plan to actually play from OBS's preview screen), but what is with the delay in the software which comes with the capture device itself? I think it's called RECENTRAL or something similar. Will I be able to play at 60 FPS in their preview screen?  I might end up buying one and test it myself. I can still return it if it doesn't perform the way I like it to."
Twitch,3dm81j,DocBenzedrine,6,Fri Jul 17 12:13:19 2015 UTC,Before you start streaming use OBS to do a local recording. Let it run a few minutes with you just testing out sound levels. Then review it and then go live.
Twitch,3dm81j,iambgriffs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:56:43 2015 UTC,I didn't even think to do a local recording. Good idea. Thank you.
Twitch,3dm81j,ChromeBits,6,Fri Jul 17 13:11:15 2015 UTC,"As a general rule your mic input should be louder then game audio.  Of course at first you can fiddle around with pre-recordings to check general audio levels. First thing you want to do is max out your mic audio to where your voice isn't distorting when your talking at your loudest. Use your ""loud"" voice, one that you actually use a lot while streaming. You want to almost max out the volume meter while talking like this, but not completely. Make sure it doesn't max out at peak levels aka shouting.  So that's your baseline volume for you mic, don't touch it anymore.  Now, take some well mixed music. Electronic preferably, but make sure it has no vocals. Anything instrumental from monstercat will do nicely. Use that song as your Desktop sound. Now record something with that song playing and you talking Loud. Test different audio levels of the music, Don't toucht the mic settings, and keep looking at the volume meter in OBS to get a visual idea on what that peek level looks like. Keep track of the different audio levels you're testing by a number (just call them out while you're adjusting); use the windows volume mixer for example. beware, if you change windows main volume, the individual progam's numbers will change. Set your windows Main volume to exactly half and keep it there  Now listen back to the recording and search for the perfect balance between what is going to be your max mic input (loud voice), and dekstop audio. Obviously you're looking for a point where your voice is Clearly audible, and the music is more in the background. But, that's a personal choice ofcourse.  The main is to remember / don't change your base settings from that point on. Especially your mic. If your voice is cool, you'll learn how to know if the balance between mic and desktop is cool just by looking at OBS while streaming live.  Sometimes I check the audio of my stream live through my phone and headphones while streaming."
Twitch,3dm81j,Pengwynd1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:05:17 2015 UTC,This is solid advice.. I'll be doing this as soon as I get back to my place. I really appreciate you taking the time to put that together. Thank you.
Twitch,3dm81j,ShinyGoombah,4,Fri Jul 17 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"I think most people just do it live because games can all be wildly different with how loud their audio is. And, like me, since you're new to it you probably won't have viewers right away to tell you if the audio is good or not (which is what I see a lot of bigger streamers rely on) so I just start the stream, make sure the game audio is running and talk over it, make sure I have my stream running in the background muted, then after my test I un-mute the stream to see how it sounds. There is probably an easier way, but that's how I manage. I also find lowering -most- game volumes to about 20-25 in the volume mixer works. Then I just use the OBS microphone volume thing to manage myself."

The bad news is that the vocal community of any game does not choose who they want to represent them. That choice is instead made by the community of people who watch that game as a whole. If it happens that the most viewed broadcaster of any game happens to be rude or unfriendly.. Well, to be perfectly honest with you, there's not much that can be done. The only thing you can do is to not watch them, using your power as a consumer.   Of course, this is not to be confused with streamers actually breaking the Terms of Service. If that's the case, simply report them and I promise you an Admin on duty will read it, taking action if necessary."
Twitch,3do5ex,Luuchan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:30:29 2015 UTC,"They can be viable, provided you work with 2 things:  1) You have a voice that people won't mind listening to a lot, since you'll be reading every line.  2) You keep a consistent schedule if you don't finish the novel in a single stream.  In the past 6 months, I've streamed Persona 4 Golden (1/2 JRPG, 1/2 visual novel, really) and (currently) Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc almost every other night. Considering my usual stats, both games have done amazingly well, with the latter breaking personal records with almost every sequential stream. If the game has an engaging story (and bonus points for mysteries), it can really bring in a crowd that wants to see what happens next. I do believe there's a ceiling you can hit in terms of gaining new viewers (niche games bring in niche audiences), but it's still a fun ride."

I've been streaming for a little over a month so let me just throw this at you. open up whatever game you want to stream. how's your frame rate? could you play it happily with 20 less fps? now, 20 fps is a pretty dramatic frame drop, and you probably wouldn't see THAT much of an impact, but it's nice to give yourself wiggle room.  give us more info! what do you want to stream?"

You have to really really stand out in some way. You've got people killing crota while blind folded. You've got guys who are amazing in the crucible and help their subs do flawless runs. You've got guys that run raid after raid on hard with their subs.     You mention you want to be like Enraged Cinemas, but why would anyone stop watching his stream to watch yours? They already have that guy. That niche is already filled.     I play a ton of Destiny and I do stream it from time to time. But in all the time streaming it I have gained maybe 2 followers.     But that's not the main game I stream because you can't break into it without a unique hook. And when there are hundreds streaming it, how in the world are you going to do something that NOBODY else is doing ya know?

Twitch,3dnklg,Birdor000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:11:41 2015 UTC,"I might be the only one to say this but don't do a 24 hour stream. I know it sounds like a good idea and that it will attract viewers but realistically it probably wont net you more than you would on a typical day.   A 24 hour stream is just going to wear you out and possible ruin your sleep schedule and your streaming schedule which are probably the most important parts of your stream. Instead, stream for 8 hours and use whats left over to work on your stream outside of streaming. Then get a good night's rest so you can be chippy for your next stream.  I see a lot of small streamers try to do 24 hour streams and it seems to hurt them more than it helps.   Of course you can do what ever you want and if you do do the 24 hour stream let me know.

People can't resist correcting you.  But in all seriousness, any pop culture stuff is always good.  Film, television, other games.  I tend to stay away from Music, Politics and Religion as those three never lead anywhere good and bring out the inner hater in everyone.  I'd recommend finding some way to segway into the topics as sometimes it can be awkward or weird for the streamer to just flat out ask ""What are your favorite movies?!"" as it can come off as prodding to talk if that makes sense.  Outside of looking for topics to talk about, work on keeping a line of banter going while you play.  I'm not saying talk all the time for the sake of talking, which can be detrimental, but try to explain what you're doing in game and why you're doing it.  If you're knowledgeable about the game talk about it.  Get comfortable joking around and reacting to the game.    Best of luck!"

I played DotA 2 on 20 FPS (didn't even realize it) and reduced ALL the video settings to basically as low as they get, I didn't interfere with resolution though. Runs at 60 FPS on stream no probs...

Twitch,3dnan9,DailyProblem,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:59:57 2015 UTC,"That depends on the resolution at which you're streaming. With H1Z1 and CS:GO you will probably get higher quality by lowering your resolution anyway - head to StreamCalc.net to figure out what resolution best suits your bitrate. If you end up lowering the resolution you'll use a lot less CPU too, so your in-game performance should be better."

As /u/BoomLiam stated, MS Edge supports HLS, which is what we use; we can sort of just point you at the stream and call it a day for ""does some shit show up? okay, good"". We fall back to HTML5 when Flash isn't available, so if you guys do disable flash and rely on the browser implementation, you'll have a similar experience. The controls aren't Twitch-branded, and you can't switch quality (quality is external to the stream itself, and not a native feature of HLS), but you can totes do it.  We are very close to releasing the HTML5 controls that will appear over the video playback element - flash if you've got it, HTML5 otherwise. This will allow you to switch qualities. Don't know how useful that is for the lot of you who just want your extra crisp Source, but the rest of you that are sensitive to bandwidth will just have to wait a bit."

You'll get a much improved player, certainly, but we can't take Flash out back and put it down until some other (mostly external) issues get ironed out.  You'll just have to trust me when I say everyone internally hates Flash too, and would love nothing more than to put it out of our misery (we don't give a single shit about it's own misery).

Unless you use a program like virtual audio cable or something similar, you have to do a per use solution.   Set your primary audio device > The device you want everyone to hear in your stream.  Launch all of those apps that are related to streaming. Set the new primary audio device > This would be your earbuds or speakers... whatever you want to hear music from. Launch your medium for whatever your listening to and enjoy.   If anything gets shut down or you restart - you have to start over again. It's a terrible thing. Why Microsoft!! WhYYYY!"
Twitch,3dn0qt,Haptikfeedback,2,Fri Jul 17 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"Still possible, although possibly not the solution you're looking for.  Most modern computers have at least two audio outputs, and if not you can get a cheap USB sound card for $10.  Just assign a program to a different output than the one you're using for your streaming and it /should/ bypass the capture altogether.  Keep in mind it won't come out your existing speakers/headphones - I bought a $5 pair of creative speakers for this, but it was worth it to avoid any messing around with Windows audio routing.

Lets say i have headphones plugged in to 1 output and speaker to 1 output and lets say i listen to netflix through my headphones and i have the game sounds coming from the speakers, wont that create an echo from the mic picking up the sound from the speakers? :P"
Twitch,3dn0qt,chhopsky,2,Fri Jul 17 17:58:45 2015 UTC,"Good question!  Smart question.  It depends how you've got your mic configured.  Most close-face boom mics really shouldn't pick up much of anything around you.  If you're running the mic on voice-activation noise gate, you'll have to tune the cut-off level.  If you're running it in push-to-talk then it won't have enough time to build up a feedback level.  Alternately, if you're willing to spend a little bit of money, you can buy an external mixer to re-combine those sounds into a single headphone channel.  Something like the Rolls MX42 will do this perfectly, and because it's passive it won't induce any hum or interference into the circuit.  For $47 it's surprisingly handy, and actually has a heap of uses that people don't think of.  It'll let you listen to both of the outputs from your PC into your headphones, but still have only one of those outputs get picked up by your streaming software.  I have something like this hooked up to my computer on the input side so I can listen to music from my phone onto the computer's speakers without having to worry about AirPlay or any of the other things that depend on wifi etc working properly."
Twitch,3dn0qt,chhopsky,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"That device looks awesome and i might have to get one of those :P For now i think i figured out a bandaid solution, since the cable of my speakers is long and i dont need the game sounds my self, ill just put the speakers in a drawer that is far away from my mic, my mic shouldnt be able to pick that up :P Anyways thanks for all your help, you were very helpful!"

Twitch,3dmv4j,farbenwvnder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:41:08 2015 UTC,6mbs is an odd upload speed. It sounds like your speed is 2mbps and you have a boost that's up to 6. User testmy.net and upload a larger file. I have no issues with 3mbps  upload for streaming  and my ping does not change unless I'm also downloading something.  My Max upload is 10mbps. What most don't realize is you can't sustain your Max upload and download at the same time. If its still occurring after confirming the correct upload speed then then it could be your network bottle necking it.   Tldr: issue isnt twitch. check your upload on testmy.net and use the  manual test.  Make sure you are making sure to also keep track of your download traffic. If your router has a way of viewing real time traffic then use that as there could be something else on your network.

Twitch,3dlt8h,Tarfu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:12:30 2015 UTC,"When you mention VPNs, I'm curious whether you can clarify, just for signing into Skype? Or in general when you're streaming, have a VPN set up?"

Twitch,3dlt8h,Tarfu,0,Sat Jul 18 04:47:02 2015 UTC,"I can't say much because it's an ongoing investigation, but be careful when contacting your local PD. I was a victim of coincidence and called my local PD to discuss swatting as a general issue ten minutes after a swatting incident occurred in my town. That turned me into what they believed was the prime suspect, calling to taunt them. I was brought down to the station (for what I thought was to discuss swatting) and interrogated for hours. They didn't even tell me about the incident until about an hour in. It was easily the worst experience of my life and it happened 100% due to  the ""contact your local police"" advice I've read on this sub over and over. Be careful when talking to the police."
Twitch,3dlt8h,Tarfu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:38:03 2015 UTC,"You should of asked if you were under arrest and of course they would of said no and you could have left, especially if they were ""interrogating"" you."
Twitch,3dlt8h,Tarfu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:49:29 2015 UTC,"You mean when I asked if I was being detained and they of course said yes because I was the prime suspect in a case with no other leads and I was sitting in a locked ""interrogation"" room being ""interrogated"" by 2 detectives who were working on getting the FBI involved with the case? The fact remains that I went against my better judgment and followed the advice of many streamers on this sub, associated myself with the police, and got fucked because of it. It was just a really shitty coincidence, but it happened and there was no way out of it. When the case is solved and they catch the guy who actually did it, I'll be posting a thread detailing the situation."
Twitch,3dlt8h,Scrubing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:57:39 2015 UTC,If you were not arrested they illegally detained you and you had the right to ask for an attorney if you were detained and should have seeked legal council. All I know if that happened to me I would be filing a law suit against the city.
Twitch,3dlt8h,CaptNikolai-08,4,Sun Jul 19 00:47:00 2015 UTC,"Contact local law inforcement and let them know what swatting is, show them your link and what you do, and possibly ask for them to give you a call if anyone ever threatens something at your home.   I'd also encourage to not give out last names, living addresses (even for fan mail / free things!) and be extremely careful on who you trust.   This isn't something you should be constantly scared of, but I do recommend keeping it in the back of your head."
Twitch,3dlt8h,Legundo,2,Fri Jul 17 09:11:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty much make it as difficult as possible to be linked to your actual home address, I have a fake address on skype and linked to my email as well and using proxy's, vpn's usually help to keep yourself hidden from people trying to get your IP which leads to everything being uncovered."
Twitch,3dlt8h,Legundo,2,Fri Jul 17 09:13:42 2015 UTC,"HERE is a link I posted on an alt a while ago, when I was still shaken up about being swatted. I caught it, no one was hurt, and things turned out well, but damn it was a rough week or so.    I've spoken with the local police many times since then, and check in regularly. They tracked down the person who did it, but they were international, so they reported it to the local authorities, but nothing will probably come of it, since no one was hurt. Getting ahead of it means that I wasn't impacted as heavily, but the person who perpetrated the crime won't be either, from what the PD has told me.    Check any domains you own, make your paypal a business account, and never reveal personal information. Use a VPN if you can. Be safe. Shitty people are everywhere, but you can't let them control your life."

For multitwitch you just add your streams to the url i.e. multitwitch.tv/streama/streamb For kbmod you go to kbmod.com/multistream/ Once there you put both twitch channels in the empty boxes and select the layout, it'll generate a url that you can post on your twitch, twitter, etc.. that people can go to and watch and chat with both streams.

You could do this with with another streaming machine (if you had a 2 pc setup).  Basically on that machine connect to his stream on twitch or whatever and show his stream on the desktop - that would then let you combine a window of the local desktop showing his stream and camera, and a window of video capture from your computer in a split screen way."

Depending on the game, it won't be very enjoyable to watch  You'll also use twice as much resources, if you're on a data cap, you'll be reaching that data cap twice as fast since you'll be viewing his stream and streaming at the same time.

If you have a second machine it would be easier and cleaner, but you could either screen capture or CLR browser the website.  You can even select portions of the screen to format it as you please. It would require a second screen or a second computer to accomplish easily.  There are a few other ""multi Twitch"" sites as well. Kadgar.net is one I just checked out."
Twitch,3dm91i,purplekoolaidguy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:36:01 2015 UTC,How are you going to fit two 16:9 streams on one 16:9 image? Best option is use one of those sites that streams two channels next to each other. The other option which is the best  for audio and video syncing purposes is setting up another PC as a server and both you streaming to it and then stream to twitch from that PC. This is also a lot of data and your internet bandwidth could easily be a limiting factor a long with your router/network bandwidth

Twitch,3dm8w3,yesanothersephiroth,5,Fri Jul 17 12:22:46 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing you can do is agree a schedule with the family and stick to it. With full time job, and family responsibilities (like me) you have to make sure that they know they come first, and they allow you time-out to stream.  By all means stream extra if you can, but try and stick to whatever days you've said on your profile.   Don't sweat about the donations button, everyone expects to see a donations button, as long as you're not begging for money in your stream and live chat!"
Twitch,3dm8w3,streambritish,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:33:37 2015 UTC,"agree a schedule with the family   Just wanted to reiterate this point. I tried to set a schedule based on my personal obligations as an individual, forgetting that those ""obligations"" included my relationship with Fiance. We had to have a figurative ""come to jesus"" talk, and I decreased my streaming time in favor of a permanent Date Night with him.  So just because your schedule looks open, doesn't mean it is--not if you want to maintain your relationships with family and friends. Set a maintainable schedule while consulting with your significant other, and avoid my mistake! :)"

Twitch,3dm8w3,iambgriffs,2,Fri Jul 17 16:12:50 2015 UTC,Family life is the life :) I set a schedule of 3 nights a week. It's a balance. I trade sleep for more stream time. It's not easy and I commend you on your efforts!  About donations - If you don't want to ask for it - setup a donation goal banner on your overlay. So that people can see that you're trying to raise money for XYZ and how much you need. If you contribute your own money - add that to the $$'s.   Crowd funding is a thing of today! People love to help and support those who need a little help. It's an amazing internet world. Best of luck
Twitch,3dm8w3,Haptikfeedback,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"I am in the same situation you are PC wise. I actually stream from my laptop. I had a lot of struggle with this, but here is what I have learned from my viewers.  I originally had a twitchalerts donation goal on my video. My viewers told me they didn't really enjoy that (almost too in your face). They suggested to me adding a panel strictly for my donation goal. I went through a long process of looking at what I wanted in a computer, monitor, and desk, and then got a price range for it all.  I then went into my donation goal panel and talked about each piece of the goal. I didn't go into extreme detail, because the people watching probably know that a computer to play and stream on at the same time is expensive.  So, how do you let people know that you're accepting donations without outright saying it? You can go to your alert site (I use streampro.io) and add a total donations received, and most recent donator to your stream. It's seen as more of a thank you to viewers.  Something else I noticed is that some popular streamers I watch actually put their donation button as one of their top panels. I think it has to do with accessability. It's right there, and easy to find.  Something I have done (could be a bad idea idk) is during my stream I've just brought up in conversation why I want a new PC (keeping it completely stream related). This could be seen as begging, but I haven't had anybody complain about it so far, so idk. Hope this has helped :)"

They don't just help hydrate and energize, they help prevent your lips from smacking (that sound you make when your lips slide over your teeth). Let your stomach do the work. You're going to be talking constantly, but when you're not, turn away from the mic and take deep diaphragm breaths. You'll end up feeling less winded in the long run. Like everyone has been saying, drink water and take breaks. Don't just pause the stream, actually stand up, walk around, stretch, do some jaw/throat massage/exercises.

BUT -> have a look at what else permitions an editor has on your channel. I'm not fully aware of what an editor can actually do with the channel.

So at peak internet times there may be some buffering.  Additionally I urge you to try using LiveStreamer + VLC to try watching a stream (Quick google search will bring you to both of them.) and see if they work better there, if it doesn't than it's could be an issue or a combination of issues between your browser, your ISP, your PC, Adobe Flash, Twitch's site, the Streamer, etc etc you get my point."

Twitch,3dlw88,xander42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:17:11 2015 UTC,"9 mbps is great. The reason I asked is because you can have an awesome computer, but if you don't have the minimum upload speed to support a decent stream then it's all pointless."

Twitch,3dlrhy,Majegs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:24:34 2015 UTC,I used to have very similar issues. Some games would work and some would black screen on OBS. Fixed it by changing desktop wallpaper. I had inadvertently changed the theme of my computer which was disagreeing with OBS. I simply switched it to default theme and never looked back.

Twitch,3dl5y4,leokim246,2,Fri Jul 17 18:48:32 2015 UTC,you would need to put the webcam above the game footage so that it would show up on top.

Twitch,3dllwj,Haptikfeedback,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:53:12 2015 UTC,DM has the best question here. Why do you believe you're being DDOS'd? Big streamers get DDOS'd because it's fun to the group doing it. A normal streamer doesn't really have to worry about it too much.

Twitch,3dk09g,thegodoflions,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"No worries, /u/drinking69!  I'm not even in support, I just like reddit.  Web-based VPNs like unblock.us don't really actually do any real VPN functionality, they're just a geo-unblocker.  If I were in a country that experiences issues like this (and until recently, I was), I would get a $5/month VPS in the U.S. and set up an OpenVPN or PPTP VPN to it.  It's not difficult, and can be well worth it when your country is having Internet issues!"
Twitch,3dk09g,chhopsky,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:12:20 2015 UTC,"PLDT haven't been working properly with Twitch for a year or so now, I used to use tardsplaya to watch streams and it seemed to work without lags but something happened within the past 24 hours that even blocked that avenue for me so now I'm resorting to a public VPN like ZenMate and using /popout to watch streams, it's working that way but free public VPNs usually aren't that reliable.  I seriously think PLDT is deliberately throttling Twitch.tv or blocking it to save bandwidth or something. Philippines has one of the Worst Internet infrastructures in the world mainly because PLDT has a Monopoly over the whole country. That's why my advise to everyone I know is to GTFO of this backwater country or don't come here to begin with.  Btw any of you PLDT users have a PLDT Fibr connection? are you experiencing the same problem? I'm thinking of switching to Fibr to stream myself on Twitch but it's looking bad now since PLDT seems to be allergic to Twitch."
Twitch,3dk09g,thegodoflions,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:35:19 2015 UTC,"Alright, it seems like it fixed itself. It's now working for me. Maybe PLDT was just doing some tweaking or something on their side. For now I'll just observe it and hope it doesn't happen again."

Twitch,3dlaxg,AlpacanBullWorm,2,Fri Jul 17 04:51:09 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I'm not a huge streamer but I've been lurking around the subreddit for a while so let me take a shot at your question.    Network. Get your name on social media, follow other streamers, and talk to other streamers from the same game you're on. Networking has gained me some extra followers, and can be a good way to make connections within the streaming community. Supporting other small streamers may lead to them helping you out, too! Play the right games. I don't quite agree with this but it's tossed around a lot here. You'll grow at a slower rate if you play saturated games, so keep that in mind. League, CSGO, etc will all be difficult to break into.  Don't get discouraged! There will be days when no one watches you, and days when you'll be very successful. Just remember the reason you started streaming, and have a good time.   Hope that helps! Best of luck to you."
Twitch,3dlaxg,xTreasure,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:02:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big stream name but I found I got a better quality of audience by hanging about in a lot of streams that I enjoyed on games that I enjoy. Chatting in those streams meant that I built a rapport with twitch regulars, sometimes even being modded, much to my surprise. Some of those guys would see that I was on and host me, thats when I'd get a bit of a follow train tooting along.   Don't get disheartened though as I've had many streams  without a single follow, in fact I've had unfollows recently.. but thats the nature of the beast that is Twitch.   Most important of all... enjoy your stream, interact with your chat if you can and it will come across well in my opinion. Im not going to follow a grumpy streamer with a grouchy face that doesn't interact."
Twitch,3dlaxg,jimmysqueeker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:15:29 2015 UTC,"Look at games that have a lot of viewers but not a lot of channels...  For Example, Bahroo is doing a Mass Effect 2 playthrough, he has around 1200 viewers every stream. There are normally only 4 or 5 other channels streaming that game. The idea is that you get some of Bahroo's viewers if they don't like chat being too fast in his channel or they still want some ME2 action when he signs off.  That might seem cheap but lots of people do it..."

Twitch,3dj44l,SOMMARTIDER,6,Thu Jul 16 18:08:35 2015 UTC,How come lots of broadcasters have 0 viewers then?
Twitch,3dj44l,RiceWineVulpine,4,Thu Jul 16 18:49:03 2015 UTC,"They probably don't view their own. Xbox and PS don't count themselves as viewers as well. Also I don't think it counts you if you watch on your phone and you're logged in, so if you use the chat from your phone you could still have no viewers."
Twitch,3dj44l,m4xc4v413r4,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:55:42 2015 UTC,It does count on the phone unless you have chat only I believe. But I know if you are watching the stream it will count you.
Twitch,3dj44l,g33z3r_hd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:31:28 2015 UTC,"Because they don't have their own stream open, and to be honest, you shouldn't, you're just handicapping your own connection and by extension, your own stream.  You can have your page open for chat or use chat in a million other different ways, the viewer count just counts people as viewers if the video playing is working."

Twitch,3dj0nz,Zeholipael,3,Sat Jul 18 22:59:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the small streamers I follow get quality options near 30 viewers. That's really cool of Twitch."
Twitch,3dj0nz,Tenthisle,2,Thu Jul 16 18:43:07 2015 UTC,Really? That is awesome.
Twitch,3dj0nz,drewlinskii,2,Thu Jul 16 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"Recently, they gave quality options to the top 1200 streams (pretty much the 1200 streams with the most viewers), and then a couple days after that, I read that they added even more so that number of 1200 could possibly be a lot higher now :D"
Twitch,3dj0nz,bashella,2,Thu Jul 16 17:48:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, a week or two ago twitch made an announcement that they would allocate processing power for buffering for as many streamers as possible, depending on traffic."
Twitch,3dj0nz,slimscsi,6,Thu Jul 16 17:48:46 2015 UTC,We have been using excess processing power for transcoding for a while now. The change last week was to add more excess.

Twitch,3dj0nz,MellowNebula,2,Thu Jul 16 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"Twitch recently upgraded their transcoding capacity, here's the blog post. Twitch transcodes all live partners then any additional resources, which will change dynamically based on load, go towards transcoding non-partners."
Twitch,3dj0nz,OneNightStanz,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:22 2015 UTC,Yeah it's awesome! The last three nights I have gotten the option after breaking 40 ish viewers. Feels good man :)

Twitch,3dj0nz,StrangerSin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"This is a step in the right direction, however, your 540p/30fps/1000kbps stream will still be 540p/30fps/1000kbps if you somehow do get encoding options mid-stream.   It's helpful for viewers who still can't view the stream at that quality, but for broadcasters, the dream of streaming at 720p/60fps/3500kbps isn't there unless you're regularly pulling in 30-50+ viewers from the get-go."
Twitch,3dj0nz,cerulean_skylark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:42:28 2015 UTC,I just noticed I got Quality options for the first time two nights in a row. Usually pops up around 40-50 viewers.

Twitch,3dj0nz,jano2006,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:56:11 2015 UTC,i dont like it being random because i stream so that everyone with a 16k connection can watch but when i hit enough viewer for transcoding in mid stream i would have to restart the stream and crank it up to 3500 bitrate so i make full use of the transcoding
Twitch,3dj0nz,slimscsi,3,Thu Jul 16 21:40:40 2015 UTC,"We are aware of that use case and will one day have a solution. But for now, I suggest you change the bitrate once your stream is promoted. OBS (and I believe xsplit) allows you to do this without stopping the stream. | Its not truly random. For some people whose average viewer count hovers around the threshold, it may be unpredictable."
Twitch,3dj0nz,scratchisthebest,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:01:33 2015 UTC,"If you are using OBS, you can go into the settings and change the bitrate, press Apply, and the bitrate change takes effect right away - no downtime needed. It's one of the few settings you don't need to restart your stream to apply."
Twitch,3dirjm,pillowman205,5,Thu Jul 16 16:34:53 2015 UTC,Too be honest. I do find that rude. I am a streamer and If someone notices me and ask me about my stream. I always ask that person to message me on twitch privately or ask the broadcaster permission. As a streamer I don't want someone coming in my channel advertising their self. I find it being desperate.   If someone is doing that in another persons channel without their permission you can call them out on it. Others might follow in example or might tell you its okay. Either way you said your peace and you showed the broadcast you respect their channel.  I do not see any harm in speaking your mind as long as it has good intentions. Hope this was helpful.
Twitch,3dirjm,JagTheNerd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, you have a really high follower to view ratio. What do you think contributed to that?"
Twitch,3dirjm,bashella,2,Thu Jul 16 20:38:00 2015 UTC,On weds I do giveaways. I get people who just want giveaways. That is why my ratio is high on followers But the purpose is to actually meet new people who might like the stream and for people who follow to show my thanks. Its a struggle to get notice these days. Giveaways help a lot. I only do it once a week so then the rest of the week the people who come back can get to know me and the community. My goal is to build a community and just have fun streaming. Being partnered of course I want it but its not my main priority.
Twitch,3dirjm,JagTheNerd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:14:59 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for the detailed reply!
Twitch,3dirjm,bashella,2,Thu Jul 16 22:30:26 2015 UTC,No problem. not everyone agrees with what people do on twitch. I do not like doing giveaways to gain people who just want giveaways but I feel I have to in order to get notice. There's just too much streamers these days.
Twitch,3dirjm,JagTheNerd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:32 2015 UTC,"Well then good thing the haters don't have to follow, lol! I've been thinking about doing give-aways but I have successfully spent zero dollars getting set up by just using crap I had lying around, and I want to continue that trend."
Twitch,3dirjm,bashella,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:54:54 2015 UTC,I recently just starting to do them. They do bring in a lot of followers but majority of my followers was from me jumping in other channels introducing myself and getting to know people on twitch/twitter/reddit. So there's other ways of getting notice. But just remember not everyone has the same schedule as you so just keep on streaming and you will get people all different times coming into your channel. I am a low streamer still. I am still learning. It's just what helps me.

If it comes up in conversation and you're just casually talking about it, that's perfectly cool and welcome. If you are outright saying, ""Come to my stream if you wanna see xyz!"" then that's an advertisement and it's at least a purge, maybe a ban if it's the only thing you've said so far."

Twitch,3dj5po,IBitePrettyHard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"Some of the camcorders in the Canon Vixia line can output 1080p60 via the mini hdmi. I believe GoPro's 3 and higher are able to output 1080p60 over hdmi as well. (Not 100% positive on this, I don't own one.)    You would then have to capture the hdmi via something like a Avermedia Live Gamer HD or Yuan SC512 N1-L DVI  (converter hdmi to DVI required)    I don't think all that hardware keeps you under $400 though."
Twitch,3dj5po,unph4zed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that GoPros can only stream via WIFI and the quality is terrible, something like 480p.

Twitch,3dj5po,unph4zed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:01:49 2015 UTC,Some of the GoPros are able to send uncompressed video out via HDMI. Not all of them.   I think using a capture card for 720p60/1080p60 is your best bet.
Twitch,3dj5po,CronoRegen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:04:03 2015 UTC,"I think /u/unph4zed is correct. I don't think you are going to get your 1080p/60 from the USB interface (I think that is what you mean by ""straight into the computer""). But many cameras have HDMI live video output that you could capture via a capture card of your choice. Make sure when choosing a camera though, there aren't any sort of weird nuances with the HDMI output stream (HDCP, etc.)"
Twitch,3dj5po,CronoRegen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:25:36 2015 UTC,What about an HDMI camcorder connected to a Firewire 800 port through an adapter?
Twitch,3dj5po,funnymike31,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:05 2015 UTC,I don't know too much about that interface but it needs to be capable of live outputting over that interface. The reason why we keep saying HDMI live output is because it has been tested that the live output option works with HDMI. You are in uncharted territory with any other interface.

Look at the streams a bit bigger than yours and see how they broadcast.  You are competing with all the other streamers for the same viewers in game..

Twitch,3deyxc,AtticaOnline,6,Wed Jul 15 19:22:58 2015 UTC,congrats man! I love the feeling of having a random person stick around and chat with you that isn't actually one of your friends. it makes you feel good. I'm glad you got to experience it :D
Twitch,3deyxc,Heep123,2,Wed Jul 15 20:06:03 2015 UTC,"It was awesome, first time I really had fun streaming and I hope really badly I can experience it again!"

The same happened to me as I was going on a datacron hunt in Star Wars: The Old Republic. Somebody popped in and provided me with a better guide than the one I was trying to use. I streamed a couple days later and the same viewer came back to check on my progress. Feels great!"

Twitch,3deyxc,LonelyQBONE,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:27:27 2015 UTC,"You could probably do with getting that monitor back or find a method of keeping your dashboard open while you stream, for all you know there could have been a thousand people watching while you were full screened and unaware, i use my laptop for most of my stream monitoring, which has the added bonus of freeing up system resources that get sucked up by displaying the decoded video preview, while the system is encoding the same video... /mindblown  The way i see it with the whole 0 viewers situation though is treat is as if you're recording for a video, one that you're gonna trim down later. Even if you're not, try make it so you'd have loads of funny/awesome/reaction moments to choose from when it comes to the editing stage, rather than just maybe 2 or 3. Think out loud if you've got nothing to talk about, discuss what you want to accomplish this stream, have a debate with yourself, it's not a sign of madness, it's live streaming :P  (And yes i know you might not be making videos, but try that way of thinking see if it works)"
Twitch,3deyxc,MrFluffy4Real,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:08:12 2015 UTC,"A little trick I use that I'm sure is ALWAYS in your face is the Twitch mobile App.  :)  You can be playing&streaming full screen, one monitor. And just set your phone/tablet in front of you with the app open. It shows how many people are watching, what theyre saying in your chat,  and you can type out responses,  obviously.   And as well if you don't want to or can't use the app just go to Twitch on your mobile browser.   No more Alt+Tabbing to distract ya :P  I figured this out as I usually stream via PS4 since my PC is ooc. I needed an easier way to chat and respond than the PS4 allows, and as well accurately see how many viewers I have since PS4 will Show you how many there are but it's a cumulative number based on that session,  which is stupid as hell.)"

Twitch,3djpm6,bashella,2,Thu Jul 16 20:51:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your equipment. I had actually been recommended that microphone by a colleague and wanted to hear it in action because I feared the price may reflect on its quality.  Plus, I'd never heard of CAD.  Popped on over to your most recent video and I was pleasantly surprised on the quality, though, I swear I heard someone doing dishes. xD"
Twitch,3djpm6,SpazMan777,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"Good, I'm glad it was useful! I want to modulate the audio quality a bit better - I shout when I get excited and it crackles. I think that this is a software problem, and I'm going to look into programs that will fix that. I think the mic picked up on the crap on my desk moving around, I live alone XD. Also, I was running my AC at the time, it sits right next to me and I think you can barely hear the rumble inspite of it being quite loud IRL"
Twitch,3djpm6,bashella,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"Fantastic! That's actually a nice little additive there, about your A/C.  Comically, I too have a unit only a metre away.  It's occasionally picked up with my microphone now, so I was hoping to move toward something with a bit better noise cancellation.  The price variance between USA and Canada is outrageous, though!  $46.52 USD from Amazon US (about $60 CAD), or $89.00 CAD from Amazon CA.  An extra $29?! Why does Canada have to suffer with stupid pricing on Amazon?  Ugh."

Twitch,3djn1t,tduva,3,Thu Jul 16 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"Chatty uses the nick colors it gets from Twitch Chat, so they should match the regular chat, except for two cases:   Chatty does some color correction to prevent nick colors from being too similiar to the background. So if you have e.g. a black nick color on black background it changes the color. People who haven't explicitly set a color in Twitch Chat get assigned a color based on their name (because Twitch Chat doesn't provide any color for them). Webchat used to do that as well, but last I checked it's now assigning a random color every session, which means there is no way to make it match (not even between different instances of Webchat).   In Chatty, when you click on a username it opens the User Info Dialog, which shows what color the user has on the bottom right. When the user doesn't have a color set, it shows one star behind the color, indicating it's a default color (e.g. Blue*). You can also hover over the color to get a tooltip with some more information. This is also explained in the help (although that section should be updated a bit, could probably be explained better)."
Twitch,3djn1t,b3george,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:19:44 2015 UTC,i think that second option is what's happening cause orange in a black background shouldn't be an issue. i will definitely check that user info dialog. (i did try look at the help but i didn't really understand what was the issue) thanks!

Twitch,3dhrtz,iambgriffs,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:30:56 2015 UTC,It'll need to be addressed by twitch. The smaller player isn't sized correctly so the bars are showing.
Twitch,3dhrtz,Growlibi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:12:45 2015 UTC,"These bars are appearing because the player is not in the aspect ratio of the playback (The playback is mostly 16:9).  This can be caused by how you have resized your window, what bars you have open and minimized (minimizing the left bar with following and stuff creates black bars for me as an example).  If your native screen resolution isn't 16:9 either I think you're going to have a rough time getting rid of them - untill you press Theatre mode. which you should. theatre mode is god tier."

Twitch,3di7qn,Tenthisle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"It is. I have used both and the Yeti is a little better.   Oh, that's right. You can't adjust the gain on the Snowball, huh? Damn. But yeah, the noise gate will kill all that background noise when you aren't talking. I'd suggest getting your noise gate set up properly then deciding if that's good enough for your purposes. You'll need to learn how to do it regardless of which mic you are using. Might as well do it now.  If you do end up grabbing a Yeti, I use mine with the gain turned all the way down. Otherwise it will pick up car doors opening outside, people walking around two floors away, and all sorts of other things."
Twitch,3di7qn,Tenthisle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:41:03 2015 UTC,so i listened to some of your other highlights and you need to adjust your noise gate better or search for a program that filters such sounds out(adobe audition + virtual audio cable) but those are expensive so just play a little with the noise gate in obs until you get the correct level.

Get a bot to frequently post the link in chat. Then change your title, put up channel art and permanently host your new channel.   Sure, it will suck that not all 1700 will move over but your regulars will. Those who won't, I guess they weren't that loyal to begin with.

Twitch,3di1wv,charge_in,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:44:03 2015 UTC,This problem has been there since i can remember and the problem is the CLR browser not twitch allerts if you notice on their site it pops up normal but sometimes it just gets lost carrying this data over to clr browser and it simply dosent pop up I reccomend you using the green screen one instead of the CLR never failed me and works perfect.
Twitch,3di1wv,charge_in,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:16:57 2015 UTC,"I can try the green screen version, but the thing is, whenever I send a test follow or donation it works perfectly fine in OBS. I was starting to think it was something to do with me changing the scene and the CLR Browser plugin not properly registering with OBS or TwitchAlerts when the scene changes. It seems like if I uncheck and recheck the source, it works again (at least for a couple follows/donations)."
Twitch,3di1wv,jamacanbacn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:53:42 2015 UTC,I think the CLR plugin still needs lot of work and I had problems with it in past and now ever since i have switched to the green screen one I had zero problems and i change scenes alot as well. I think it could be that the clr browser just gets some kind of lagg and you have to uncheck and chek again. For your next stream use the greenscreen one and see hw that goes.
Twitch,3di1wv,jamacanbacn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:59:20 2015 UTC,If the alerts work in the green window and not in CLR browser then its a CLR browser issue. TwitchAlerts does not make CLR browser. Generally make sure you have the latest version and all the files CLR browser asks for and make TwitchAlerts a global source. Some users have reported having issues after updating obs so you may need to delete the CLR browser files.  I can confirm our services have not been down the whole week.

Twitch,3di0k9,KhaineGB,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:04:48 2015 UTC,when you go live search your channel and you should see it with the cam icon then click into that and just leave it up while you stream and you can click names to mod

Twitch,3di0k9,KhaineGB,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:06:41 2015 UTC,I use a laptop. I'm actually repurposing an old Dell machine for chat and my chat bot. That way I can monitor the stream how my viewers see it AND respond to chat

Twitch,3dh69e,TheRebelToast,2,Thu Jul 16 06:13:38 2015 UTC,"I stream a lot of Witcher 3, and being a small channel I asked myself the same thing.  The Witcher 3 has so much dialogue that if I let the game take focus I would never be talking.  I find it is best to react to the dialogue like ""damn"" ""I wouldn't do that"" etc.  Ask chat to make some decisions and choose the other one once in a while if you don't agree.  I've noticed I get a great response when reacting like this and I answer all questions after the dialogue has taken place and I am not speaking directly over the character, just in between dialogue between two characters."
Twitch,3dh69e,Monnix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:42:29 2015 UTC,I tried Witcher 3 and my community just did not like all the dialog. I completely understood and switched gears.
Twitch,3dh69e,Jesuswept669,-1,Thu Jul 16 13:32:11 2015 UTC,how did you get it to show your stream beside your comment
Twitch,3dh69e,xWaNTeD_DeAd,2,Thu Jul 16 10:31:39 2015 UTC,"I streamed some dialog heavy games and I found making witty comments or sarcastic remarks to some of the choices helps. or generally mocking the characters, thats what I do anyway :)"
Twitch,3dh69e,CaptNikolai-08,2,Thu Jul 16 07:18:26 2015 UTC,"I played several dialogue heavy games like Deponia and Witcher3 its always good to throw some small comments in but if you really have to say something, maybe respond to the chat, a question etc.... wait until the dialogue stops for a choice or something. Some people really really want to hear what the character sais ;) So basicly i react to the dialogue bitween the lines or something ^ ^"
Twitch,3dh69e,Brombeere,2,Thu Jul 16 08:48:23 2015 UTC,"I say it's okay to a point, I don't stream a lot of dialogue heavy games but I did stream Assassins Creed Unity for about a week, I would talk through most of the dialogue because ppl who were there either didn't care about story (including myself) or already beat the game. So I say do what you would want to see, would you like to see someone make fun of this games dialogue? would you care if you didn't get the story? would that matter? in the end viewers may agree with you"
Twitch,3dh69e,Deveral5,2,Thu Jul 16 09:12:45 2015 UTC,"I say your good bro, go with what you want to do, Ive been playing a lot of life is strange lately, and just be you, be genuine with yourself and things work out great in the end. I would explain my thought process on how i made certain decisions and i would share stories of things ive been through similiar to the in game content. Like there was a moment in the game that people were saying Devin therapist OP. because it literally relies on you saying the right things to save someones life. but its honestly your personal preference, i talk a lot during games but thats me in real life. Just be you and dont stray from your actual personality or else people will notice. I need to start streaming regularly again. But anyways good luck my friend, and just be you and youll love it, People are drawn to real people, not fake personalities."

Twitch,3dhrlx,UltimaN3rd,2,Thu Jul 16 11:30:42 2015 UTC,"It took me almost no time at all to get to 47 followers, then I hit a wall. Took me double the time to break 50. After 50 however the follows started pouring in xP You will always run into walls like this among other ones while streaming. Everyone has a different wall, the thing that makes or breaks a streamer is how they deal with it. Try and figure out what changed.   Did you switch games? If so losing a few is understandable as some people only watch for a specific game. If you want to be a variety streamer this is something you will notice and have to deal with. The ones that stick around are the ones that will watch anything you play! Keep gathering these individuals and you will have one classy community!   Did you change times? I used to average 20ish viewers before I changed my time (I had no choice as I started my job and had to work around that). When changing times you lose some people due to their own schedules. If you can make sure you are paying attention to how the time hurts/helps your stream. Look at the game you are playing and see if when you start a big streamer is just starting, or another big streamer starts shortly after your time. If possible move your time if that is the case. I don't know if you watch Dropped Frames, but they discussed this yesterday. When you start to not only pay attention to your stream but those surrounding you, then you will start to see massive improvement.  Are you using social media? Make sure you use twitter! Follow people and some will follow back. Make sure you are using hashtags correctly!   Stream title name This is a new bit of information I found out due to dropped frames. In your title make sure you have the game you are playing first, then other stuff. Example: Rust - Playing with viewers. It may seem redundant but by having the title of the game first it allows people that search the game find your stream. So if someone typed Rust, my stream would pop up for them due to the name.   Other things to note You can try and become part of a team! Teams help a lot and I have met some awesome people from team rejects (There is a post for that team somewhere here). You should also check out game streaming central (a bunch of classy individuals) as well as dinosaur mustache. Both of these communities are filled with awesome individuals that want to grow and help others grow. Also make sure to become friends with other streamers! I have a group of streamers that I consider myself friends with. We raid each other all the time as well as give shout outs! Do not ask for raids, or shout outs on another persons stream however. That can be considered advertising in another persons stream which is a terrible thing to do.    Other than that just have fun! Yes some of us here are trying to grow and become partnered/live the dream. Is it easy? No not at all. Twitch is time consuming. It requires a bunch on networking, studying, hard work, and a good amount of luck! Everyone grows at their own rate. Do not compare yourself to another streamer just make sure you do your own thing. Study and do the research, as well as network and use social media to your advantage :P Good luck with streaming and don't forget, always have fun :D    edit made it look pretty...kinda?"
Twitch,3dhrlx,Dorbii,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:07:51 2015 UTC,I am as small as you are and my advice is: 1. have fun streaming not just for the numbers of followers 2. game/topic selection is key (no AAA games or hyped games) 3. Check ur stream quality 4. Maybe you changed something or you are just getting boring for viewers cuz only doing the same.  I can not repeat that enough: you should really constantly ask yourself if you think you would watch yourself. Maybe this helps you seeing mistakes.  There is no general success path because everyone would take it if there would be one. So it's more or less about trial and error. And you should be ready for it.
Twitch,3dhrlx,dookey1337,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:10:02 2015 UTC,"I've been streaming on and off for the last year.  In the last couple of months I've become more committed to streaming and stick to a schedule now (Three evenings a week I commit to broadcasting for at least three hours or so). My followers are still going up extremely slowly (I'm under 70 atm) but since getting back in and streaming regularly that number is going up, any stream where I get one follower I consider a success!  The advice about not playing AAA or extremely popular games is pretty much golden. Having a unique sticking point about your stream may help you stand out. My channel is dedicated to the massive gaming backlog I've accumulated over many years so the stuff I play will vary greatly from game to game. The smaller the viewerbase for a game, the more likely you can get yourself to the top of that list and pull in any potential pundits.  Of course really getting on with your viewerbase is key too, I've got a small but great little community and a handful of regulars who keep coming back. Treat them as your priority and when others see you doing that they'll hopefully want to get onboard with that interaction to.  Most of all though, just have fun.  Happy Streaming!  Marc."
Twitch,3dhrlx,LolatronHerperOfDerp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:30:57 2015 UTC,What I do when  I stream I only have my chat window and my follower alert open so that way im not bothered with the viewer count as  it could be very daunting for you just respond to chat. Do you mainly stream the same game? are you good at the game? There are 2 type of streamers verity streamers and man game streamers which one are you ?I recommend watching back your streams.

I haven't started on the part of the project that needs a constant connection and socket reads so I haven't tested timeouts/bans yet.    Edit: The bot account is not my own channel account (1billionhex) but has mod permissions and has a verified email account. The streamer it is trying to host is online and streaming."
Twitch,3dhpdi,MysteryShadows,4,Thu Jul 16 10:45:55 2015 UTC,"Sure, you could use a cryptocurrency, Google Wallet (idk about their age limits) or other online payment system. Or you could have your parents/older sibling set up a PayPal in their name and let you use it, though I would suggest they set it up as a business account to preserve privacy. Music.twitch.tv is were you'll find stuff that Twitch has agreements with the copyright holder not to mute. Alternatively, you can stream any music you want, which is actually not legal but in practice, very few copyright holders are sending DMCA takedown notices to streamers. Segments of your VODs will get muted though. Finally, you could spend a lot of money on a broadcast licence and be totally legit. You'll have to research this as methods differ from country to country. It's not hard, just takes a bit of time. Services like TwitchAlerts, SubAlert and TNotifier all have tutorials so pick your poison.   Have fun streaming!"

Twitch,3dhkjz,thegands,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:51:55 2015 UTC,twitch is currently in the process of converting user's streams from FLV to HLS. all the partnered streams are converted but they are still rolling it out to everyone else. look at the URL of your past broadcasts. if it contains a /b/ then it is still FLV and you will not be able to view it in the twitch app. if your past broadcasts contain a /v/ then it is HLS and it should be viewable in the twitch app.  it is explained in a bit more detail here: http://blog.twitch.tv/2015/05/weve-updated-our-content-appeals-process/

Twitch,3dhezj,Redzombie18,2,Thu Jul 16 08:12:17 2015 UTC,Honestly depends on which games and resolution you are going to stream. Fps is best with 2500 bitrate 60 fps and 720p.  Where as I seen some hearthstone streams with 1000 bitrate look beautiful as well.   So post your current computer specs and current upload and download speeds so people can help you out.  Honestly 5 upload is alright. I have an upload of 8 and its runs perfectly for me.
Twitch,3dhezj,Splinxes,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:33:13 2015 UTC,Here are my speedtest results.
Twitch,3dhezj,KhaineGB,2,Thu Jul 16 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, you want to be using 75% of your upload for twitch. So if you're doing a 2000 bitrate stream, you'll want about 2700kbps upload. 3500 is the max, but that's only recommended for partners.   I personally don't go above 2000 due to people mentioning buffering issues above that."
Twitch,3dhezj,TeamKennedy,2,Thu Jul 16 08:42:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say have 5 mbps upload at least. Max of 3.5 mbps upload for streaming and then the remaining amount to count for playing games online or anyone else in your house who may be using your internet.  As for download? What ever you want/comes with the plan really. I'd suggest at least 20 just for things like downloading games, watching streams, etc. But chances are with a 5 mbps upload plan you're almost guaranteed to at least have a decent download speed so shouldn't be too hard or an issue."
Twitch,3dhe5r,-SpitE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:59:34 2015 UTC,It takes a while to update and sync usually half a game for me.  Also the feature does not kick in until you are over 20+ solidly viewing.

Twitch,3dhrhw,DerikTI,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:16:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're asking here.  Anyway, if you want to have a better looking stream without using more bandwidth and you have a decent CPU, you can change the encoder preset from veryfast to fast (or even more if you can handle it) and it should improve the stream quality a tiny bit."

From a software standpoint, if you're using an Nvidia card you can turn the brightness much further down in the nvidia control panel, this is what I do as I'm fairly photosensitive. ATI probably has a similar solution.  Someone else mentioned FLUX, and while that's a program I use, that is more about yellow tinting your screen to cancel out harsh blue light, than actually darkening the screen much."

Twitch,3dh205,DorkyNinjas,2,Thu Jul 16 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"These posts come up so often. Way to often.  The Blunt of it and the answer every time is to play what you want to play. There is no magic play list that will make you a instant star.  Yes it can be demotivating to stream to a empty room, but you have to look at streaming as a hobby. You have to put the effort into it even when nobody is there. If you think you couldn't do a month of streaming with 0 viewers, then it probably isn't worth it."
Twitch,3dh205,RiceWineVulpine,3,Thu Jul 16 05:32:32 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I don't consider my answer the universal and single correct answer either. It's just my approach of choosing a game (and I also don't always follow it because I'm lazy )  While I agree with you about that there is no magic bullet, I don't consider ""play what you want to"" as the universal answer for that question. Sure you should play what you want to. But at the same time, you most probably don't like only one game. So within your pool of games, some are better for being streamed where others fall behind on that.  I personally would go for this (even though I didn't do it for my current game, I normally choose the games to play by that):   Look at the games you want to choose from on twitch. Look at what place you could make in the game directory if you'd stream that game at your schedule. Do you make it to the top row in the Directory? -> head on to the next point Look at the viewerbase of the game. Is it big enough that someone would click you and you still would hit the first directory row after going live (with your regulars)? -> go for it, stream it ... if not, start over your evaluation for the next game.   So that's basically my answer is not far from the standard ""don't play over saturated games or games with low viewerbase"". But what I constantly try to aim for is a systematic method for applying that stuff. Because ""over saturated"" and ""low viewerbase"" means different things depending on your actual live performance. All the evaluation you do, has to consider your viewer count, because that's the single property twitch is rating you on. So for a small channel with something like 4 or 5 regular viewers, games where the first 2 rows in the directory are filled with channels having 30 or 40 viewers would already be considered oversaturated for me. Because in that case I'd never get the exposure in the directory I'd need to make good growth from streaming that game. For a bigger channel, that already has these 30-40 viewers, that game is perfectly fine. For an even bigger channel, that has something like 500+ Viewers, that game very vell qualifies for the ""low viewerbase"" award, because it can't provide that growth, that stream would want to see. At some point though (speaking of even bigger channels) it doesn't really matter anymore what you play. Because when you maintain your 2k (or whatever high number you want to choose) viewers independt of the game, they will come anyway watching you. I don't know how growth would be affected though, but I guess they also see lower numbers there, when playing games with small viewerbase.  I know for sure that there was some ""tool"" for analysing viewers vs channels for different games on twitch somewhere on this sub ... but I can't remember the link. Anyway, that tool didn't consider your own channels size and lacked some other important numbers like ""distribution of viewers over channels"" and ""what place in the directory would you make by streaming that game"". Furthermore that tool just made a snapshot of the current timeslot ... so no historical data, which is extremely valuable for that kind of analysis. You simply don't want to rely on one single data point and then ""invest"" 100+ hours in a game that wouldn't be worth streaming because it doesn't fit your channel size."

But I've observed that on my nexus 7 2013 I do get a black screen with audio playing while watching some streams at source. The android version is currently 5.1.1 but it also happened with previous versions.  The only stream where I can remember it happening consistently is http://www.twitch.tv/margaretkrohn, when turned down to high it works just fine. Sadly I'm not currently subscribed so I can't check the vods but I suspect in my scenario it may be caused by 1080p at 60 fps. Someone who can check her past broadcasts might be able to verify this.  If I have the time I'll try finding some other channels that cause it or maybe just see what Maggie's stream does on the other Android devices available in this household: - Nexus 7 (first gen, also with some version of android 5.x.x) - Samsung Tab S 10.5 inch - HTC One X+ (android 4.2.2)"

In an un moderated situation they can type some thing in your chat and see the reaction on your face in real time.  All of this with complete anonymity, no real world consequences and not having to leave their bed room.

If you just answer them like everyone else and don't react in any way to what they're saying, they'll just grow tired and go away.   They're just like RL bullies.   I streamed some Clash of Clans yesterday. In that community it's normal that newer streamers gets asked for base reviews. This is basically finding the viewer in game, showing of their base and talking about it and giving feedback. It's a good way to interact with viewers.   So I set up a queue system with deepbot and did base reviews when I had time. Some had to wait 5 min and some 40 min. One guy came in and asked for bare review. My bot told him how to enter the queue, he wanted it straight away. I told him to join the queue like everyone else, and he left. Everyone else seemed to like the queue system."

Twitch,3dcuaa,kitiaralol,2,Wed Jul 15 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"The sense of entitlement with some viewers is astonishing   Yeah, this is a general thing you'll find on the internet when you're a creator (versus a consumer). If you create anything (jokes, articles, streams, videos, guides, etc) consumers (people who read/watch whatever you create) will be largely negative and demanding.   I think it comes from the fact that they have alternatives at zero cost. Lirik's stream costs nothing to watch, I can read a different guide on how to do X, I can google other jokes or watch network late-night television, I can watch another stream, etc. People are just so used to getting everything for nothing that they have no problem demanding perfection. The internet also works on hyperbole: everything is ""fucking terrible"" or ""stupid as fuck"" or ""amazing"" or ""genius"". There is no middle ground at all. And since they are only consumers with no experience trying to create, they have little empathy. Add in anonymity and you get what you see.  Of course they can never make any money or create anything of value if they remain as consumers, whereas you have the possibility to take a leadership role (streaming to X amount of viewers while they watch), develop skills and possibly create a revenue stream. You grow as a human being by trying to create something that others want to consume, you develop skills from the process that can be carried over to other pursuits; they stagnate staring at their computers, passively consuming."

If you don't give them a reaction they will move to the next stream and do the exact same thing there. It's helpful to remember, it's not personal.

Twitch,3dfdk3,Ferhmal,3,Thu Jul 16 00:57:10 2015 UTC,"Took me a few weeks before I had my first few viewers. I can give you the scarce few tips I've collected (Heck I only have like 44 followers atm) from much more popular streamers than me.   Stream mid-popularity games. It's all about reducing the amount of clicking/scrolling before people find your stream. While popular titles on twitch are at the top of the list, people have to scroll three pages down just to find your stream. Same goes for the less popular games. Unless people are specifically looking for it, it'll be so far down the browse page people won't just wander in. Games with a few thousand viewers, and maybe 15-20 streams seem to get the most ""pop in"" viewers. Make your overlay eye-catching. When I went browsing, I noticed I gravitated to the streams with the cleanest profile, and the best quality. Get a sharp webcam boarder, a nice bracket for the game you're playing, maybe some features like a follower scroll. Don't clutter your stream up to much, but make the little thumbnail people see when browsing attention grabbing. Smile, talk, laugh. Seriously, you wouldn't believe how many sour-faced streamers you see, sitting silently jabbing away at a keyboard. Who wants to watch that? It's your discretion if you greet every new viewer, but in the least be happy, make comments about the game. It will make viewers come, and stay."

Twitch,3dfdk3,MrFluffy4Real,2,Wed Jul 15 21:30:23 2015 UTC,"This. If you stream something really popular (LoL Dota, HS, etc) you'll find yourself buried at the bottom of a reaaaaaaally long list. Same with flavors of the month. Sometimes, though, some people are willing to try out small streams, so I wouldn't avoid popular games entirely.  I've found more success (that said I'm still really small) with either smaller or older games that still have people interested in them. People still enjoy watching Warcraft 3 custom games or Dark Souls I or WoW private servers, but it's best when you find people that'll follow you around to whatever games you like playing if you can't stick to just one game like me.  That being said, don't just jump into streaming games outside of your interest because you think you'll pull in viewers. If you're not enjoying the game, people who wander into your stream will pick up on it, so don't force yourself to play it too long or ever again if you don't want to.."

Twitch,3dfdk3,thejdubb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"I'm no super-streamer but for what it's worth I found that I get the most viewers who follow on to the next game by playing older games that have a solid community around them, and having a relatively regular schedule. For a while I was streaming whatever I fancied playing and there was very little consistency to my streaming. Occasionally I'd get a passer by pop in and say hi, but rarely would they hang around or come back. That changed when a friend bought me a copy of Dark Souls in a steam sale. Once I settled into doing regular streams of the same game, I noticed I got a lot more return viewers. Look for games that you want to play that are in the 100 to 1000 viewer range regularly, I call them perennials. Xcom, Dark Souls or Skyrim are good examples. If you stream them for a full run-through, most of the community will probably pass through your stream eventually. Most will just move on but some will like what you're doing and follow you onto the next game. By the time I finished Dark Souls I would get 10 viewers fairly regularly, however be prepared to lose many of them when you change games. Of those 10 regulars I still see most of them from time to time, but only three or four continued to follow the stream regularly. These are the cool kids you want to find. From then on it's a case of rinse-repeat until you're confident you can go play something outside the perennials and have your newfound followers, er, follow."

I have also been successful doing this intentionally as well.  I keep an eye on the latest released popular games on Steam (Popular New Releases I think its called). Check the ones you are interested on Twitch to see if anyone is streaming them. Many times, there are zero streams. Do it and be the only one.  I did this with a new MMO once and had almost 120 viewers because everyone was trying to decide if they wanted to buy it.  I have about 10 regulars from that stream to this day...that was over 6 months ago.   Again, not a great strategy, but can help you get off the ground."

There are some that I can play on stream and it looks and plays fine, others that I just can't, and a whole bunch in between.  I reckon a decent new gaming laptop would be fine so long as you're not trying to push 1080p 60fps at 3500 kbps. I would strongly recommend a second monitor, though. Trying to run a stream and interact with chat off a single 17"" (or smaller) screen is pretty much infeasible."

Twitch,3dfzkx,MCofTime,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:44:09 2015 UTC,look at more guides and stuff about settings. I don't know about your pc because the settings for streams are determined by a mixture of your pc hardware and internet speeds. Are you using the 2800 bitrate and 60 fps in the video? try turning it down to 2000 and try 30 fps. What resolution are you using? You can set the base resolution at 1080 but down scale it to 720.   You really need to use a lot of trail and error with obs to find what works best with your internet and pc. Also don't stream with a really high bitrate and 1080p if you aren't partnered because then people with shitty internet are going to have a hard time watching you.

It's actually pretty easy if your good at following along.    Couple quick things to get you started though!  Download OBS or XSplit - Both have pros and cons to them, xsplit is easier to setup imo, obs has more customization options  If you have not gotten a capture card yet, avermedia makes some good cards. I just picked up the Extremecap u3 and its working out great for me so far.  USB 3.0 is required though if you pick that one up.   Other than that check out google, just google capture card setup for whatever program you use to stream ( xsplit or obs ) and the rest is easy.  Good luck!"

Twitch,3dfj8t,ninjazor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:55:47 2015 UTC,I have the same problem. The issue is actually with the playstation gold headset. Because it's wireless thru the usb dongle all audio is ported thru the headset. This is a problem on both PS3 and PS4 with this headset.   The only way I have found a solution to this is to unfortunately purchase a new headset that routes your audio thru the optical jack on the PS3/PS4. So Astro A40 or A50s would work. I'm sure there are some other headsets too but I am looking at getting an A50 to get around this issue.  This problem could be fixed in the future with a firmware update but I doubt it will happen.

Also, as a console app streamer, I've found streaming at higher than the suggested bitrate is not good, even if you have the internet resources to manage it (I myself have 75 up, and still only stream at 2000 kbps).   this is because, even though you have the resources to stream higher than that, many people watching will not, so the stream will become choppy.

Twitch,3dfct0,RiceWineVulpine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"Both do 1080p 60fps Edit - only Extreme USB 3 does actual capture at 1080p 60fps (sorry my mistake, thanks ricewinevulpine - below)  I actually have both of these devices, My first was the USB 3 Extreme, It lets me do captures as input on my laptop. The PCI I got was for my main streaming PC.   You must have usb 3 for the extreme, and if it's an old desktop you've got and you've bought a usb 3 PCI expansion card then it can be very picky over what it likes. Also remmeber that usb vdeo devices want to eat up all your usb bandwidth - so you'll need to be careful about what other usb video devices you're using at the same time. (e.g. camera's). I'm sure newer motherboards have less of an issue than my 2010 machine.   I haven't played with component inputs on it.  The live gamer HD is the PCI card, I don't use the HDMI output on it so can't comment on lag if you're going to use it for your video out. But I have to say I love it - it's awesome - I've never had any problems with it, and any framerate issues I've had are from my gaming rig and not the live gamer HD in my streaming pc. It means I'm not using usb bandwidth for capture and can save that for usb cam's and audio inputs.  I know there are more expensive cards out there, and more professional ones. But those gave me the best results, at the best framerate for my budget.  hope that helps :)"

Twitch,3dezwj,MrMagius,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:23:25 2015 UTC,"Keep an eye on your ingame fps. Hit tab, then stat fps.  this will help you make graphics adjustments for best performance.  Some things you THINK will help, actually do not.  Also, when you change certain settings, like textures to lower, you will need to wait for the textures to update before you see the fps increase.  I currently stream ARK using 2x 560 ti's running three monitors(game on one of them)and a 2600k @ 4.6.  I'm fairly certain SLI is still not supported :(  I start at low preset, then turned all sliders to zero and unchecked all boxes.  I then go 640x480, fullscreen window, resolution scale to max, AA at epic, world tile at epic, textures on high. This is the combo that works best for me right now and I get about 40fps.  I downscale in OBS to 720, and bitrate is 1700.  Here is one of my latest videos from before my PSU crapped out last week, although it doesn't show these specific settings.

Twitch,3detq5,eSportWarrior,2,Wed Jul 15 21:12:43 2015 UTC,"In Denmark there's no risk of ""Swatting"" - We don't have SWAT. We do have ""Politiets aktionsstyrke"" (Police task force) which covers the same bases. They however do not operate the same way, and I confirmed this with my brother who's at the police academy.  The Police Task Force is stationed one place in the country (The capital) and has a 1 hour response time. They will not be dispatched before a threat evaluation has been made - This simply means the local police will take the call and respond, evaluate the threat, and if it's real, then a ""swatting"" can occur.   What this boils down to is that if someone calls in and say there's a hostage situation at my address, a police patrol comes over and knocks on the door, I open up, and they leave seeing there's no threat."

My school got evacuated like 2 months ago or so because someone claimed that there was a bomb. But luckily there was no bomb and it was safe to go back to school in the course of a couple or days. Me and my classmates was absolutely in no danger because we were on a school trip to Bornholm (a Danish island).

I imagine Canada has something similar."
Twitch,3detq5,LtRoyalShrimp,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:12:43 2015 UTC,Yes - Canadians have similar task forces. For example I believe the Toronto unit is called Emergency Task Force (ETF) and they likely have very similar response styles to American swat though I'm only making assumptions.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Task_Force_(TPS)  I'm sure similar units are throughout the rest of major Canadian cities though I have no idea about details.
Twitch,3detq5,hubsmash,0,Wed Jul 15 22:55:16 2015 UTC,"can viewers even just ""pull your info"" from twitch at all? I may be wrong but the way I understand it is the streams themselves aren't directly uploaded to users from streamers unless i misunderstand the way it works. The streams are routed through twitch servers acting as a proxy of sorts.   They can get your IP address if you use something like skype to chat with your viewers i hear. Anyone care to weigh in on this?"

If that's not it, right click the source and there should be audio settings on the right half of the window. Make sure it's enabled properly.  Also you don't want to try to listen to the game from the capture (using the headphones on your computer). There's a delay and you won't hear sound in sync if you're watching the monitor/tv. For streaming you may also want to offset your mic and your camera (if you use one) so viewers get the best timing on your reactions.  Let me know if this works. It's what I can remember immediately.

I'm just salty because I love twitch and I finally got my identity back after 10 months of bullshit.  It was the worst experience of my life.  Was it because of twitch.tv and flash?  Probably not, but who the hell knows? All I know is that to use the website I love:  I have to either operate using a very insecure plugin that many hackers exploit on a site with a recent, massive security breach, OR watch twitch through an annoying third party app which does NOT help support the channels that I watch which deserve the support.    I understand I'm being a complete dick and everything, so sorry about that, I'm just venting my frustration at the situation.   And I don't know what percentage of Twtich.tv's operating budget is targeted directly at getting off of god damned Flash, but if you've been working on it since 2013 and nothing yet, I think that it's fair to say its not enough.    Maybe it's not so much that the management is cheap, and more that they underestimate just how insecure adobe flash is so they aren't dedicating the proper resources to it.  I would've thought that recent security breach where you emailed me telling me that my information was comprised would've sparked twitch to get moving but I guess not"

I totally don't blame you for being pissed that you feel like something you love is exposing you to risk, after going through hell for nearly a year!  I would be security-conscious too, hell you would be a bit silly not to be after that.  So yeah, completely understand your reaction.

Twitch,3d94gc,hootener,8,Tue Jul 14 19:38:54 2015 UTC,"Twitch.tv's competency   Hmm...   Twitch.tv's priorities   FTFY. :P  As a developer that's deployed my fair share of Flash and HTML5 based live streaming software, HTML5 streaming video isn't ""hard"" in the known space of Difficult Things You Can Do on the Internet. It's a solved problem.   That doesn't mean it isn't challenging at scale, though, particularly when you're replacing a legacy system. Twitch has been delivering Flash video since the JustinTV days. That's over nine years of accumulated cruft around supporting a medium that basically died out from underneath them. In the span of their explosive growth, who knows how many kludges and weird little Flash related quirks have to be rooted out, understood, and potentially remedied before an HTML5 based system can take its place.  Not only that, but Twitch has to roll out something that's stable and performant across millions of users. Can you imagine the backlash if Twitch releases too soon and it's buggy or unreliable? Chaos.   I want to see Flash die as much as anyone else, but I can't blame Twitch for being extremely cautious with this rollout. When you're a live streaming platform, the ability to live stream* is sort of crucial to your business model. If you deploy something too soon, and it stands the remotest chance of jeopardizing that ability, you're treading on very thin ice.  *In before ''it doesn't do that very well now!""

Large scale work that has to meet or exceed a previous systems' QoS is a big, time consuming challenge.

Twitch,3d94gc,hootener,6,Wed Jul 15 02:08:59 2015 UTC,"The management team sucks by your assessment, which seems to only be concerned with dropping Flash.   By all other sane metrics, Twitch's board (and company) has been killing it since 2013, in terms of growth, infrastructure, and reach. Just compare the 2014 annual report to the one the released in 2013:   doubled their broadcast time in a single year added even more infrastructure to support European viewers Expanded into new verticals (music, etc.) Got bought for nearly $1B dollars   This is every definition of success except yours, apparently.   I'll reiterate, Twitch is in a real hurt to drop Flash support. It needs to happen and soon. But irrational vitriol and hyperbole helps no one. Understand that this company is spinning a million metaphorical plates at once, and only one is labelled ""Drop Flash Support"". As a customer, you have limited awareness of only those plates the company chooses to talk about. So anything you have to say concerning Twitch's budgeting, motivations, and future plans is likely completely and totally incorrect."

They don't have a competitor. Games as sports is growing. That leads to 1 thing. Twitch's growth. You can bitch and moan about peoples hyperbole here all you want, but it's true.

Twitch is one of those companies like Riot - people see Pool Party skins and scream about priorities but they don't see the massive network upgrades, the infrastructure rollouts, the platform code, the thousands of man-hours that go into improvements every week.  It's just way too easy to say 'well this should have happened by now', and every competent developer who's worked at scale is busy saying to chill.  It's just plain not that easy to turn on.  How do the server loads vary when the changes are made?  What adds milliseconds on a single server could add up to block conditions that add seconds to a stream.  Will it use more RAM?  How much?  Is the ratio of RAM to CPU in the servers still sufficient?  Will the network traffic look different?  If there is a difference, will our existing QoS policies be sufficient?

Twitch is one of those companies like Riot - people see Pool Party skins and scream about priorities but they don't see the massive network upgrades, the infrastructure rollouts, the platform code, the thousands of man-hours that go into improvements every week   You mean Twitch is just a bad as RIOT? Riot claimed to be ""working on"" fixing East Coast ping disparity since 2011  We still get 90 ping higher than the west coast.   Most games open with a fucking east coast server.  They're stupid enough to make only ONE server for all of NA in california, and 5 years after they know its a problem, they still havent fixed it.  So i dont know why you're proud to be like RIOT they are trash too.  EA Studios is more honest than twitch + riuot combined and thats saying something"

Can you share the source you're quoting their budget numbers from so I can know what their priorities are, too?  I keep asking for sources because you keep piling on the hyperbole.

In fact, you can find posts on this thread where I agree with you. It's all the bogus assumptions you make about twitch that I'm disputing you on, because they do little to help or inform the discussion.  Let's take your ""source"" from your reply. Okay, he's the guy working on the ""player"". What does that mean? The ui? The in browser playback? The back end methods necessary to support whatever other functionality they had integrated into a nine year old bespoke player? Is he doing all of that? Some of that? You have no idea. I have no idea.   Yes, they need to get their player done, but you have no idea what's going on at twitch, you have no idea the scale of the rewrite, you have no idea what budget they've allocated to it or their priorities, or the other challenges they may be facing alongside this port.   Your anger at the situation isn't what bothers me, it's that you're using what scant information you have to support uninformed opinions and useless hyperbole. It's not helping, your downvotes and others telling you to ""calm down"" illustrate that.  I'm not saying don't be angry, you're well within your rights. If twitch isn't meeting your expectations you should by all means support another company that does. But when you just spout snarky uninformed comment after snarky uninformed comment you're not helping anything...you're just being another angry neckbeard shaking a pitchfork on the internet. And we both know you're better than that, right?  But really, man. We share a similar mind on this. Twitch needs to get this done. So can we just agree on that and move on with our lives?"

We most certainly were not working on HTML5 playback in 2013 - we started the process at the very end of last year, and the real work got under way the beginning of this year."

Twitch,3d94gc,xeramon,3,Wed Jul 15 12:47:53 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely - it's easy to see the confusion.  The move to HLS made for massive increases in capacity and (I believe, it was before my time) paved the way for HTML5 video.  Without criticising the support staff involved I'd say that was just not explained well.  Historically these technical things haven't been well explained to the community - something I plan to change!  Question: would you watch a twitch stream where we give updates on projects in the works and engineering developments?"
Twitch,3d94gc,iambgriffs,3,Wed Jul 15 13:58:25 2015 UTC,Thank you for the clarification. I personally would prefer a update video or a blog post to a stream with updates since it's easy to miss a stream.
Twitch,3d94gc,terriblehashtags,10,Wed Jul 15 14:22:50 2015 UTC,They've also said they switched from HLS which is what they were using to MSE so they're rebuilding everything. Chat just got finished on HTML5 so they are making progress.   Is it as fast as I want? No. Is it something? Yes.

It needs engagement from video, infrastructure, capacity planning, network and web frontend.  So there are at least five teams involved.    I should make a comment on the Resources thing though - 11 months is not a long time to scale up from Startup mode.  The only thing worse than not hiring someone you need, is hiring the wrong person.  And the wrong person always tells you that they're the right person!  It's very frustrating.  There are currently ~50 positions open at Twitch.  That means around a 20% increase in staff is happening right now.  Someone new starts literally every day.

Twitch,3ddmgb,Bazeleel,2,Wed Jul 15 13:16:23 2015 UTC,"Frankly, you don't have the upload to stream at 720p. For 720p you want to have at least 3Mbs up total anything lower than that is just not really possible. Keep in mind that even 3Mbs is cutting it fairly close, so if you do upgrade try to get the highest you can."
Twitch,3ddmgb,DangerDitto,2,Wed Jul 15 13:33:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, now that I notice it, if ""9/2"" is your internet speed, OP, you may want to turn down your bitrate and see if that helps."

Twitch,3ddmgb,DangerDitto,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:36:51 2015 UTC,"I dont know what to tell you, by all accounts 1600Kbs is just too low for 720p. If you were playing a game that had a lot of static elements on screen (ie. Harthstone) you might (might!) be able to scrape by, but for anything like an fps that has alot of movement and constantly changing elements you just need more upload to support it."

Twitch,3ddmgb,DangerDitto,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:18:06 2015 UTC,"Using a lower bitrate won't result in dropped frames though, It's just a quality issue."
Twitch,3ddmgb,Mugros,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"The OBS information page on dropped frames states that definition of dropped frames is ""that your connection to the server isn't stable, or you can't keep up with your set bitrate."" His connection can't sustain the 1600Kbs he has it set to so it's dropping frames."
Twitch,3ddmgb,Mugros,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"Well, your argument was that 2mbit is too low for 720 because of quality, not too high because of his upload capabilities. Quality wasn't his problem though, it's dropped frames and they are not caused by low bitrates.  A 2mbit line should be capable to sustain a 1.6mbit stream. It's close to the max, but not that close. He would need to check that there is no other network activity though... or upgrade his internet connection, what he did."

Twitch,3de7zl,LtRoyalShrimp,-2,Fri Jul 17 10:04:37 2015 UTC,"The delay can range anywhere from 20-60 seconds, I find. Depends on how graphically intense the game is. Also depends on how fast your computer can process the stream."

Twitch,3dazxu,bonellia,9,Tue Jul 14 21:43:49 2015 UTC,There's some great ideas in there. I always thought they should have a friend list of some sort.    The problem when you start packaging that much into a single program is that it can easily become bloatware. People tend to stick with smaller/more efficient software that is updated more frequently. I think Twitch looks at it like why pay to reinvent the wheel?    There is definitely potential for something more. I'm not sure an all inclusive program is that something though.
Twitch,3dazxu,unph4zed,2,Tue Jul 14 22:34:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go so far as to say something like this would be like bloatware. But what I would say is this stuff would be COMPLICATED. A desktop app would be pretty sweet, but that would require a ton of programmers and money, and I could totally understand if Twitch didn't want to drop cash on that."

Give them all the tools they need to produce quality content, rather than having to spend hours setting up multiple applications to provide all the bits of functionality that is pretty much expected of a streamer nowadays.

Twitch,3dazxu,Diirge,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:34:34 2015 UTC,They partnered with some companies back in the JustinTV days and it didn't work out very well. Most people eventually went with xSplit or OBS when each came out.
Twitch,3dazxu,Blinity,5,Wed Jul 15 15:49:38 2015 UTC,Steam is mostly just their website wrapped in a desktop package. Same thing could be done for Twitch.

With all the chargeback problems, profane customized alerts, and all that good stuff, it would be too big of a mess for Twitch to deal with. Twitch would have to assume an overseer role and regulate all the content. As it is now, Twitch puts the blame on the broadcaster for anything done on their channel."
Twitch,3dazxu,Nyaliah,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:04:38 2015 UTC,"Anyway, in short, I think this shouldn't be a hard thing to develop    That statement is so confusing. your first point is ""broadcasting tool"". Do you think they ""just"" should integrate OBS? Or is it a ""not hard thing"" to quickly develope their own tool? Most points in your list are complete new features.  But shouldn't be a hard thing to do.... Should be really quick too /s  Why would this help with the HTML5 integration? And why mention the resources used on the apps? What got that to do with a completely new product? Why do you assume that they use ""not that big"" amount of resources in the apps?"
Twitch,3dazxu,_TassadaR_,-1,Wed Jul 15 07:38:39 2015 UTC,"Your point are valid, I really did assumptions that I won't defend with passion, but my point is, it must not be hard for such a big company, that's all I'm saying. About html5 thing, I just think it's honestly easier to decode/encode with local codecs once you are not dependant on browser limitations, such as vp9 webm on Firefox etc.  About mobile apps, I don't accuse of them with anything, I'm just saying it's probably not that ""huge"" investment for such popular thing.  Still, I'm sorry for being kinda lost between technical parts of this idea."
Twitch,3dazxu,Blinity,0,Wed Jul 15 07:57:02 2015 UTC,"I am just getting tired of people in this sub assuming that everything is so easy. You can't magically produce software. And why do you think it is not a ""huge"" investment? Most of your suggested points are completely new features. A broadcasting software by itself is a huge project, you can't just take excisting software and put it into your product. Twitch will have resources (=developers) and those are most likely working on excisting projects already. You can't ""just"" hire a bunch of new developers and assume that they know the project right away.  Let alone your donation button suggestion. I have no idea about the legal aspect but I can imagine that there might be some issues if they ""just"" implement it. Not to mention that the technology to ""just"" donate doesn't excist. Streamers right now use third party solutions. And twitch would obviously want to get a cut from it, more legal blubb and technical things. Everything is possible but your repeated ""just"" and ""can't be that hard"" is not correct. And a step further, why should they develop features, the main application doesn't have, for a desktop app that most likely not everyone will use? And for example ""Improved customizable profiles"" is something that would be have to be adjusted/implemented on all platforms."
Twitch,3dazxu,Altruit,2,Wed Jul 15 08:42:28 2015 UTC,"You have no idea what you are defending even. Just blindly throwing obvious shit around. If you are to not prefer using it when existed, then don't. But I see no reason to not use it if it ever existed. I believe it is doable and just because it is not ""easy"" doesn't mean they shouldn't. Who the fuck even said ""it is magically producible"" and you can just ""put existing software"" in your product. If I say ""just"" do it, it doesn't mean that it is not doable.

Twitch,3ddsur,Zaalie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:38:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, bitrate will affect quality in terms of how the stream looks (as in, if it's pixelated or not). If you're not partnered, you should stick to 2000-2500, otherwise your viewers are going to have a problem with buffering.  Another thing you can do to reduce delay is to go into settings, and under Channel & Videos, there's an option to reduce the delay. I only have a 15 second delay in my stream with that turned on.  Good luck!"
Twitch,3ddsur,Ramautso,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:59:12 2015 UTC,"Twitch does have its own natural delay of around 20-40 seconds, but you can reduce this slightly by enabling the 'reduced delay' option in settings which to my experience reduces it to 10/15 seconds. Usually when I stream the video of my stream is a lot more delayed than the viewers receive it (because I'm also streaming so it buffers slightly for me), but I find pausing the video resets the delay and gives a more accurate representation of what the delay actually is - the buffering queued up so if you buffer for a few seconds every 10 seconds you'll have about a minutes delay eventually. But definitely the most accurate way of working it out is just by asking your viewers"
Twitch,3ddsur,Ramautso,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:37:07 2015 UTC,"But it was just weird to have a 60-70 seconds delay, and that my stream would literally just freeze. I tried to turn my stream on and off then, and it happened again and it was instantly at a 60-70 seconds delay. I know that it usually builds up whenever it buffers, but is this something I can change in the settings? It seems to just buffer freeze or something.  My stream usually freezes whenever I alt tab, and it looked just like that, except I wasn't alt tabbed.  I'm pretty bad at wording myself here, hope you understood what I wrote just now."

Twitch,3ddops,moocaten,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:43:48 2015 UTC,"even weirder now, I uninstalled and reinstalled the assistant,(third time now), and then selected the documents directory for my user. This time the song title file was empty, so when I added a new request it worked."
Twitch,3ddjrc,Kn3xis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:49:38 2015 UTC,"Hi pal, I use Ankhbot in my channel to help keep the running of my stream smooth. You should check it out. I use support the stream for my donations, twitch alerts for my host notifications, and tnotifier for my follower alerts. I use these different sites because each has their own benefit. I have my overlay at the bottom of the screen with my camera on the left side coming out of my overlay. I use a green screen to help the effect. I have a different overlay for old games that don't run in widescreen. This overlay has a thick bar down the left with a quadrant for my camera at top and the chat underneath. On my usual 16:9 display, I have the chat in the top left. It's only small, it's transparent and it fades as it scrolls. I like a minimalist approach whilst giving all the info about recent followers, followers goals and social channels on the overlay at the bottom of the screen. Next time I stream I'll take a screenshot and post it on here so you can see what I mean. I hope this helps. Remember to check out Ankhbot, it's an amazing tool."

(basically not using chromes native build in flash player - you can swap to non native chrome flash plugin using chrome://plugins/ or just swap to firefox and take a look)
Twitch,3dd66c,streambritish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:26:28 2015 UTC,"u can swap to non native chrome flash plugin using chrome://plugins/    yep, as soon as i switched to firefox it uses a max of 2-4% CPU. (mainly spikes when loading a page), disable flash in chrome and got the same result, but obviously that inhibits me from watching anything on twitch. I would love to stick with chrome, since firefox uses like, 700MB of ram, but that cpu usage kills me."

He has like 200 something followers, which by twitch standards is not much, but it's better than CohhCarnage where people get drowned out by emoticon spam. The little guys just spend more time interacting with their viewers and it feels more intimate."
Twitch,3d8ygn,gagsy92,2,Tue Jul 14 13:44:36 2015 UTC,"As a fellow small streamer, I also love the...intimacy?  Yeah we're going with that...the intimacy that I'm able to have with my followers.   Building relationships and friendships with people is amazing, and one of the things that does scare me is, if I somehow get big, how do I maintain those relationships.  However, I stream for me and that was one of the most important things that I had to learn to keep from getting discouraged.  Don't let some shithead's comments bring you down.  I'd rather have 3 viewers who are genuinely interested in what I'm doing, than 100 viewers who are just there to be assholes."
Twitch,3d8ygn,Mugros,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:50:12 2015 UTC,"oh, I would call it intimacy for sure. I know tons about my regulars and they are great people. I would have never met them if it wasn't for twitch. They are literally from all over the world. A Quality community is definitely what I'm shooting for. They all get along and talk with each other as well. Haters generally don't stick around because my followers always are looking out. Differences of opinions are great but flat out vomit spewing isn't tolerated."
Twitch,3d8ygn,DrunkieMunkie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"We actually discussed this the other day on someone's stream/talkshow that I was on.    I think some of the trolls are necessary.

However, you start messing with my viewers, then we have a problem."
Twitch,3d8ygn,Legundo,2,Tue Jul 14 15:04:46 2015 UTC,"I've been stuck the past week or so, haven't really gained/lost followers, just... blegh.  BUT! My regulars are there the moment I start streaming (sometimes before, I've opened that tab to active chat sometimes) and god are they excited when the stream starts. That's what it means to me, and why i keep streaming 3 or 4 days a week to 20 people or less."
Twitch,3d8ygn,gagsy92,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"My streaming adventure has been really dynamic. Some days I lose a follow or two and some I gain new regulars. Twitch is a really interesting creature, and regulars really keep me motivated. Lets not forget the ""luck factor"" as well. I have yet to be raided or really hosted by a big streamer for that matter.  Having a non follow week isn't that uncommon, so no worries. Every time I stream I learn something, no matter if people are watching or not. I always review my past broadcasts and take some mental notes or what I can do better."
Twitch,3d8ygn,kammello,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"What you said here shows the importance of a solid schedule, they know when your gonna be online and they get hyped for it!"
Twitch,3d8ygn,gagsy92,3,Wed Jul 15 06:44:17 2015 UTC,"The smaller streamers are always the better streamers because they offer a lot more in terms of interaction. I think there are almost like 3 sides to Twitch;    The first being the big streamers who rake in anything from 1,000 viewers to 10,000+. These are the streamers who have the chat move so fast to the point where they read about 1 comment in 50, which makes it difficult to interact with the viewers so it's pretty much a stream of watching someone playing a game. You then have the semi-successful streamer, getting a few hundred views regularly and have a nice balance of interaction and gameplay. They'll miss comments for sure but they'll still reply to every comment as best as they can. Then you have the underdogs (which, in my opinion, are the best), these will get a handful of viewers, maybe get up to a few dozen on a good day and maybe even hit near 100 on a really good day. They have the perfect balance of gameplay and interaction because a comment rarely goes unread and it's a lot easier to get to to know these guys. Some small streamers who I randomly stumbled upon, I am now friends with and play games with. They've even given me tips and encouraged me to stream myself.    I've only streamed a handful of times myself, but someone said they find my stream entertaining and they like my sense of humour, and just like you said, I felt flattered and really appreciate comments like that."
Twitch,3d8ygn,imthetroublesolver,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:03:38 2015 UTC,"This hit the nail on the head. I just can't watch the largest streamers, it's just not my cup or tea. The chat is insane and I don't get that interaction that makes Twitch so great for me."
Twitch,3d8ygn,Kaphira,2,Tue Jul 14 14:07:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you get a hell of a lot more out of smaller streamers than you would from the bigger ones. There are big streamers which really do stream great content though, for example, CDNThe3rd, he plays H1Z1 a lot but he role plays that he's in an actual zombie apocalypse and asks random players stuff like 'So how long have you been surviving?', 'What did you do before the outbreak?' and whenever someone mentions anything related to the game, like servers or something, he slaps them and says 'This isn't a game, this is the apocalypse! You need to snap out of it!'.   When gameplay is that entertaining, the interaction is kind of forgotten about. He does set aside like 20 minutes at the start and end of his streams (and sometimes in between) to focus 100% of his attention on chat though, because he knows when he's playing he can't read everything that pops up."

I see Summit get a lot of views and heard him mentioned on different streams a few times so thought I would go give him a watch. I honestly don't understand how he gets so many views, he just looks like a normal guy who plays games. He doesn't seem to do anything exciting, he doesn't seem to have any sort of high energy, he's not particularly that funny, I just don't get the deal with him.   I remember he appeared on the real life Old Spice survival game and it was like they just brought in a random guy off the street. He didn't make any jokes, he didn't make the guy do anything entertaining, he kinda got a bit quiet at times, it was just awkward to watch."
Twitch,3d8ygn,Gadgeit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:53 2015 UTC,"I watch summit as well, and while I do see your point, I feel like there is one aspect to streaming/the viewership that has not been mentioned so far: people who watch streams the same way they would watch a highlight reel/tutorial on youtube. They watch the stream to see good players play.  I know some of the streams I come back to regularly, I do so in the hopes of bettering my own game. When I do so, I sacrifice the experience of a lively community.  Not saying there's a right or wrong way, just that this is one of the ways.  However, especially since I started to work on streaming myself, I am gaining a new appreciation for the small streams. Just yesterday I stumbled on a streamer with about 40 views, in which the chat was extremely interactive and welcoming. It was refreshing. :-)"
Twitch,3d8ygn,Gadgeit,2,Tue Jul 14 22:48:40 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. I do the same with a guy who streams Fifa, although he's one of the middle class streamers, he's partnered but only gets a few hundred in per stream, so I can definitely relate.   Yeah, I know a couple of small streamers who have regular viewers which are so nice and that I've made friends with. I'd very rarely get that in a popular stream."
Twitch,3d8ygn,rallei_lol,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:26:40 2015 UTC,Agreed! Actually i enjoy smaller streams more than very big ones. mostly because its easier to commuicate and chat with the streamer!   Ill definitly hit a follow and check your stream out bro!

Maybe entrust one or two of your regulars with the ol' banhammer to keep order.  Generally, using your twitch URL in-game is not received well by other players.  This incident was a little overboard, but when you promote your stream to an online game, expect pushback.  Try not to dwell on the negative. Most people aren't like that."
Twitch,3dco3a,Oremm,2,Wed Jul 15 06:26:46 2015 UTC,"I've already committed to not advertising in game anymore. It just invites trouble.  I've made two regulars mods, might make more. Thank you for the suggestion, and I'll try not to dwell on it."
Twitch,3dco3a,miellarino,2,Wed Jul 15 06:32:50 2015 UTC,"It probably won't get better, but eventually you learn how to deal with it.    Get a bot like moobot that will allow you to automatically time out spam/bad words.    You can also go to their profile and report them to the admins. They review pretty regularly, so they will TOS them if you include actual information about what they did (I just copy and paste their d-bag comments into the form).  If you can, try to get a regular to mod for you so you can try to focus on the stream instead of the trolls.  At the end of the day, they are just internet trolls. They say stupid shit because they have issues with themselves."
Twitch,3dco3a,miellarino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:06:06 2015 UTC,"Just tonight I've tried out Nightbot. I might switch over to moobot, since people claim it's a better.  I reported the first spammer I ever got, with screenshots and everything, but the ones I had tonight were just throw-away accounts made to target me directly. Not sure what admins can do about that.  Either way, thank you, I'll try not to focus on the trolls."

You could always try both and see which you prefer!  Coming from JTV, I've probably had the worst of the worst.  TTV ones are pretty tame.  My old method back on JTV when I amassed a lot of viewers (and trolls) was I'd troll them back and a lot of times they would leave.    They are all pretty spineless, after all, as the streamer, you're the one putting yourself and your face out there, and they are the ones hiding behind a computer screen."

Twitch,3dco3a,miellarino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:31:12 2015 UTC,"Here in Germany most people use DSL. Getting a new IP manually is a matter of seconds and you will get a new one every time the modem establishes a DSL connection anyway. An IP ban would be useless. Additionally, banning an IP could and will just affect the next user who gets that IP. And this system is not only used in Germany.  So, while an IP ban is possible, it would be a bad move for a big company to implement it. At least not with certain limitations."
Twitch,3dco3a,distortednet,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty positive twitch still does it, even though they know it is pretty useless. Most ISP providers in North America use static IP addresses.  They have also been known to IP ban a range of IP addresses.  This is why i say if it's a dumb troll who isn't able to change their IP and/or doesn't know how to use VPN, it is useful.  Without disclosing identifying details as to the staff member who has done it to me ""as a joke"" I know that it has been used in the past and it's done in a manner of one click."

Twitch,3dch0w,AylaJayn,2,Wed Jul 15 16:28:12 2015 UTC,OBS probably. the program provided is nice due to the flashback feature but thats pretty much it.   Also 32 bit drivers suck crashed my system alot when using the Elgato I borrowed from a friend. Results may vary though.
Twitch,3dch0w,DiamondRyce,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"I own a Roxio Game Capture HD Pro, don't buy it ever. If you can't afford something better like Elgato HD60 or Aver just save up instead until you can. But never buy roxio. The captures aren't recognized by just about all streaming tools. If you use window cap instead it lags. Finally the editing software that comes with it freezes and crashes constantly. Also the system requirements are inaccurate."
Twitch,3dch0w,raunchyram,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:04:57 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you will be using it for.   For connecting consoles to a PC the Elgato and Avermedia are most commonly used. Blackmagic offers some nice cards with more connection options, but they are pricey.  I can't personally recommend Avermedia as I'm in the process of sending mine back due to poor quality and stability issues with OBS.  For high resolution/refresh monitors and you'll want to look into Magewell or Blackmagic.  If it's a streaming pc set up, research will be key. There are multiple ways to go about cloning your screens. How you go about that and obtaining the best quality is dependent on your current hardware."

If you get this version you'd either need a splitter or to capture the game footage from something like Amarec   https://www.sabrepc.com/yuan-sc512-n1-l-dvi-single-channel-dvi-capture-card.html  I suggest this card because it has very, very little latency, is easy to plug and play one you have the drivers installed (no fiddling with the capture card's resolution settings to get it see whatever it is you're trying to capture), can pretty much capture anything, and won't incur any screen tearing when capturing a second PC unlike some cheaper capture cards.  I couldn't recommend this card more - it rocks."

Twitch,3dard5,IAmGuise,8,Tue Jul 14 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"After all it's a live streaming site, running replays half the time somewhat ruins the purpose of that (and I suppose it's seen by some people as a cheap way of getting ad revenue). As past broadcasts are implemented, personally I don't see a reason - in the interests of viewers - to rebroadcast past streams, other than possibly circumventing around VOD muting or chatting with other people excluding the streamer themselves."
Twitch,3dard5,laagone,4,Tue Jul 14 20:50:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see a reason - in the interests of viewers - to rebroadcast past streams   Twitch audiences do not watch past broadcasts.  It's a combination of the way they are stored/archived being somewhat obtuse and the prevailing attitude of ""it has to be live or else I can't enjoy it.""  DansGaming does a whole MONTH of re-runs every October (with 1 new livestream per day) and nobody complains...in fact, his viewership tends to be at its highest for the year."
Twitch,3dard5,Oremm,4,Tue Jul 14 21:02:57 2015 UTC,"I think the core of Twitch is that it's live broadcasts, so airing re-runs seems out of practice. Giving that convenience to your audience who missed your broadcast should be done via local recording and export to YouTube.  E-sport events and convention re-broadcasts are an exception to the unspoken rule.  This is what I figure. I didn't look up anything, so if there's an actual rule on the matter I figure it'll pop in here soon enough."
Twitch,3dard5,Infiniteus,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:54:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the re-broadcasts of e-sports events is what made me think of it.  We seem to be okay when big companies do it, but not the little guys!"

His goal is to keep the stream more consistent and broaden exposure.      The problem is that even with (R) in his title and Nightbot doing auto announcements people mistake him for being live and ignoring their comments. When that isn't happening, chat is completely dead. The viewership of his live streams has risen (not sure if it's a result of the rebroadcasts) but his rebroadcasted streams always have very few viewers.    I don't think he's been successful with it but he is sticking to his guns. As I speak he has rebroadcast playing. 8500 followers and 4 people viewing. No chat overlay."

Twitch,3dbkk7,Reaxram,3,Wed Jul 15 01:02:09 2015 UTC,verifying your email is the easiest thing. It also helps the trolls that you're dealing with because they would have to get all their account emails verified to chat. Also how do you know your viewers don't have verified emails?

The person is very obsessed with me and keeps making new accounts, there is clearly something wrong with them.  I've reported them to Twitch using the report feature in their profile and reported each alt account.  This person pretends to be other people but is VERY recognizable in their actions and speech.  My mods and I also use http://bashtech.net/twitch to look up when the account was made.  An account made immediately after a ban + the usual tell tale signs of this person make sleuthing them out easy.  Still, I hate having to be skeptical of each new person.  I submitted my first complaint 4 days ago I believe and have yet to hear anything.  Today SEEMED OK, but the person might have just learned to be quiet.  So yeah, I totally relate to you.  It does impact the mood.  I try to not antagonize the situation and just ban and move on, without discussing it in chat any more than I have to.  I would say to have any witnesses and friends report the person as well, to help build evidence.  It can't hurt.  I see that people have said the time it takes Twitch to respond can vary and I know Twitch won't really discuss what actions they have decided to take against said person, but does anyone know if Twitch will respond to our complaints to let us know they were dealt with?  Even a simple ""We handled it"" would make me feel better and less paranoid of new viewers."

This is enough for every other application you are running in the background, even for multiplayer games. For the VPN solution you might have to just try it out yourself to see if it's any better with the new connection."

Twitch,3db9xo,GL1513,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:24:21 2015 UTC,"Your CPU is definitely on the lower end. Since you mentioned it's more FPS drops rather than lag, it's more likely your computer can't handle streaming.  OBS takes a big toll on the CPU not to mention the game running itself and any other programs you have open.  Try lowering the resolution, and stream at 30FPS.  Additionally, make sure you're using the Game Capture rather than Screen/Window. Those can tank your FPS if trying to capture a game with them.  Capping your FPS to your monitor's refresh rate can potentially help also."

Twitch,3d8xq1,Jesuswept669,3,Tue Jul 14 13:05:08 2015 UTC,"I've lurked around twitch for a long time and what keeps me in most channels is non-forced viewer interaction. Where the streamer interacts with his chat as much as he can, without trying too hard to be anything other than himself. If that means he disagrees with me, I still like that better than the TV commercial-type ""I agree with what you're saying. I also want to add that this product and anything you say about it is amazing"". I also like it when they play for fun.

Twitch,3d8xq1,Dcat682,2,Tue Jul 14 20:15:38 2015 UTC,"Well, that bot would call out people who really have no intention of being called out or interacting with chat.

I would much rather watch someone that I disagree with half the time, but is always honest.  Be Humble What I mean specifically is remember that you were once a viewer yourself with no audience. I love to see broadcasters that interact with the little guy (responding to Twitch/Twitter messages and such). You might think that responding to some random person's comment is not a big deal, but to them it might be.

Twitch,3d8xq1,SledgeTheWrestler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:25:21 2015 UTC,"As a viewer, I mostly end up gravitating towards streamers who are more basic in their setups ie less overlay clutter, extra noises such as alerts, etc.  I usually want to just chill out and relax as much as possible and some of my favorite streamers just get me in that zen mood instantly.  Also it's a massive thing for me that the streamer keeps up with chat as often as possible.  Obviously when tough sections of the game come up its hard to read chat and play but if there's one thing i can't stand, its a caster who goes a long time with zero interactivity.  As a caster, I try to provide that for my viewers and keep things chill and fun.  EDIT: i should also add that audio quality IMO is far more important than visual fidelity.  I can forgive some heavy pixellation during action scenes but what I cannot tolerate is microphone quality from the 90s with gameplay audio that sounds like a 144P youtube video"

Some will stream for a myriad of these reasons, and that's what makes it worth it to them. Sometimes you'll complete your goals and have new ones (setting new milestones).

Twitch,3daj78,PeoplePoweredGames,2,Tue Jul 14 23:18:40 2015 UTC,"There are several people who stream 3d animation in Creative (And as mentioned a few in Game Development as well). However, none of them are particularly popular.  It's probably a combination of little to no conversation and not a lot of actual action on stream.  I've done 3d animation myself a long time ago and fiddling with vertices, while fun to do, isn't very fun to watch, which is also why I don't watch any of the 3D animation streams myself.   There's no reason not to stream it while you're at it, but you should be ready to hold a conversation and talk if you want to engage any viewership.  I believe there are/were some Dota 2 3d animation streams who were doing fairly well - Probably due to it being DOTA 2 related. My advice would be to make 3d animations related to a game to engage with fans of said game. If you're making content related to a specific game you're also allowed to stream under that game, which may help you engage more viewers. (Though I should say that Creative is a very nice place to start out and you can get a comfortable viewership there if the content is good)"

Twitch,3daale,DigitalAnomaly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:48:32 2015 UTC,"The Source engine, particularly CS:GO's implementation taxes the CPU quite a bit already.    My advice would be to set your fps_max to the refresh rate of your monitor or up to double your refresh rate. This will ease the load on the CPU.    Another thing you need to do is disable multicore rendering as it introduces an unnecessary load on your CPU."

Right click the game source > Filters > add a Color Correction filter. This won't let you adjust saturation, but it will let you adjust Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma. As for resource usage, it may be a small bit less resource intensive but it might be hard to notice depending on your system. Performance is certainly a goal of OBS Multiplatform but the largest part of the performance impact of streaming is from the encoder, and there's not much that can be done about that. OBS Multiplatform has a browser source written specifically for it: https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/browser-plugin.115/"

Even in television you have your trash tv shows (stuff like jerry springer, cops, etc) because there is a market for it.  combine trash tv style with chat, and you have one interesting dynamic to say the least.  as with all things though, if ya don't enjoy it, change the channel!"

Ignoring a problem makes it bigger, which based on the recent trends of less desirable streamers, it is nearing a tipping point.

For me, it used to be the case that I could just watch anyone as long as they were entertaining. Now, that's definitely not the case. The standard for visual quality has definitely gotten a lot higher over the past 2-3 years."
Twitch,3d9y0t,CronoRegen,2,Tue Jul 14 17:31:25 2015 UTC,"for me, the visual quality isn't nearly as important as the sound quality.

Twitch,3d9y0t,BlackDahlia1147,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:53:50 2015 UTC,"For me, its pretty important. With all the competition out on twitch you need to keep your ""game tight"". I think the most important thing for me is audio quality. A good sounding mic is probably first on my list."

Twitch,3d9y0t,TheXseption,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:39:01 2015 UTC,"I won't watch a stream that has bad quality, but I would watch a low quality stream as long as the audio was good and the video didn't lag/buffer/skip. I, as well as lots of other people, usually put streams on in the background so as long as I can hear and glance over to see whats happening from time to time then that's all I need to enjoy a stream."
Twitch,3d9y0t,riseyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"Quality is very important to me, my standards are very high, higher than most. I primarily watch 60fps streams, I only watch a couple 30fps, and only because they are my friends and cannot stream higher than 30 (streaming straight from the PS4.)  I tend not to watch streamers with webcams or overlays. I understand why they are used and how they can improve a stream, but for me it does the opposite. I come to Twitch to watch gameplay. Overlays and webcams reduce the amount of game I can see. I prefer a well setup green screen if a webcam must be used.   Mic quality is important as well. Not as important as video quality, in my opinion though. As long as your mic isn't distorting, sounds somewhat clear and sits well in the stream mix, I can get by with less than stellar mic set ups.  Like I said, my standards are very high, much higher than most. I'm very, very picky about who I'm willing to spend hours of my day with. I don't refuse to watch streams lower than 720p60fps 3000 kb/s but, tbh, I don't enjoy them as much."
Twitch,3d9y0t,rockstarking,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"The sad part is that I feel that you and I are in the minority here on this sub which makes us the %1 of the %1.  Audio quality is honestly more important than video quality but so many people don't know what good audio quality is and/or have speakers/headphones that are so terrible they wouldn't know the difference because they use speakers that cost literally $5 new.  So many huge streamers have mic quality and audio mix quality that is so abhorrently awful it gives me a headache within a few minutes. Many of these people make enough from new subs in one day or just sub income to literally pay for an audio engineer to come to their house and pay for the absolute highest quality of equipment to be setup for them use and be trained how to use it. Stream audio should sound the best with it at the loudest on the slider.  I've spent probably 300 or more hours just on my audio since fall 2014 or so when I got rid of that crappy Blue Yeti.  People that make money from streaming and clearly don't put ANYTHING back into their stream to improve it essentially insult the thousands of other streamers that do improve their stream.  There's no point in a green screen if it isn't setup correctly with proper lighting either. I spent 16 hours one day just to perfect the software settings of OBS/Webcam and down to the direction the light bulbs were of my lighting which was already somewhat tuned to the ideal within the room I'm in. All just to get rid of all the most artifacting as possible etc.  with about 3,000 hours of live time since 2013 I have at least 1,500 -2,500 in offline time improving something about the stream."
Twitch,3d9y0t,riseyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:37:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a lot of dedication. Much respect to you, sir!   I agree. These big streamers make a lot of money, (I don't think people realize how much money this big streamers actually make) and getting good audio is pretty simple, (In theory, troubleshooting on the other hand...) so I don't see why the bigger streamers don't invest in better streaming equipment. The guy streaming for fun in his off-time shouldn't have better equipment than the guy making thousands a month (at least you would think, right?).  I also agree about the green screen. If you can't set it up correctly, you honestly shouldn't even use it, it's just a distraction seeing edges, or 'fuzzies' on-screen. Do it right or don't do it at all (imo)"
Twitch,3d9y0t,ShinyGoombah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:04:09 2015 UTC,"I only really care about video quality if the game has a lot of small text. For example, if I watch LoL I need high quality, because most streamers keep their in game chat small, and I love reading the flaming that goes on. If it's something like CS:GO then I can watch on low quality, because I can see the gun, the opponent, and that's enough to know what's going on in the game for me."
Twitch,3d9y0t,Shado_Temple,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"Stream quality is something I've struggled a bit with; that is, whether to shoot for the highest quality my setup can achieve, or find a compromise that allows greater accessibility to viewers. Until the recent Twitch update, I kept my streams at a solid 540p 2000kbps, because I was afraid of losing fans who can't watch anything more than that. Since quality options have become more commonplace for non-partners like myself, I bumped up to 720p 2500kbps, but the transition to a transcoded stream doesn't happen immediately, and so I'll get a handful of messages in chat before it happens, complaining that their internet can't keep up."

Twitch,3d9306,Jesuswept669,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:45:40 2015 UTC,Attracting trolls aren't necessarily a bad thing.  It's how you handle trolls that make you break you.  In my opinions a troll is just another viewer.  They can mess with me and I'm fine with that.  However if they mess with other viewers and the other viewer doesn't like it...

Anyways, with the trolls, you just kinda have to deal with them. Putting that you're Learning is a bit of a double edged sword, it'll bring in new viewers just because you're new and it's always fun to watch new people do anything... But then you have the trolls who are looking for that just to start shit.  My recommendation is just to boot them from your stream if it starts to get out of control, but if you ignore them, usually they go away."

Twitch,3d7rnc,Destro190,2,Tue Jul 14 18:39:05 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'd recommend with the cheaper kits is to buy some clamps from a hardware store too (get the rubber tipped ones so they don't tear the fabric) and fold the screen in half so there's 2 layers of it, the fabric is just thin enough on the cheaper kits to see through if it's not folded in half and can artifact slightly when you chroma key it.  Another thing I'd recommend is iron it before use because the creases make it tough to get an even solid green background.  And finally, make sure you've got some lamps to light it up with, try getting 2 identical lamps or 2 of the same kelvin temperature (depending on your budget, lamps measured in kelvin are typically pro/prosumer stuff) and go for an even light that makes the whole thing as near to a single shade of green as possible :)  And as always, TEST BEFORE STREAMING! nothing worse than going live, getting viewers and realising your green screen is all flaky on stream doh   Best of luck, you can have all kinds of fun with a green screen :D"

Twitch,3d9emq,Jokosmash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:50:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, so we can say that there is most likely a problem with the Browser Plugin installation.  What version of OSX are you running? And which Browser Plugin version did you install (copy and paste the file name from the Browser Plugin page).  It's probably a computability issue, but more information should confirm this. Also, as a sanity check, completely kill the OBS (Cmd+Q) process and re-open OBS after you've installed/re-installed the Browser Plugin to see if it lets you choose BrowserSource as a Source."

My favorite youtuber is something like a beauty guru but not really and I personally wouldn't expect mean comments. But holy hell, half of the comments are like ""just die please"", ""you are so ugly it hurts my eyes"" and so on.  I can handle twitch trolls because I always have someone lovely in my chat, but dear God I would die reading those shit comments on YT. And I have no idea what kind of messages she is getting privately...  There are shit twitch communities too. Tried streaming LoL for a week and questioned if I should be streaming at all, switched to Hearthstone and loving it. Even some trolls are nice.

Twitch,3d98bh,slimscsi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:40:32 2015 UTC,"FireTV, Roku 3 and chromecast support up to AVC level 4.0. So 1080p@30 will play fine. But anybody broadcasting at a higher frame-rate and does not have transcodes will not be viewable on these platforms. 720p@60 will play fine."
Twitch,3d98bh,hubsmash,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:38:25 2015 UTC,Wait I thought my chromecast only did 720p. Am I an idiot? Is there something I need to do to enable 1080p because I'm almost certain it wasn't listed as an option.   Again I may just be an idiot.   Or perhaps you mean the device is capable despite the software not offering it?

But here google claims AVC (H.264) level 4.1. Level 4.1 can support 245,760 macroblocks per second. A macroblock is 16x16 pixeles. Hence 245,760 / ( (1920 × 1080) / (16 × 16) ) =~ 30fps = 1080p@30"

Twitch,3d958a,FaV_Valentin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:53:34 2015 UTC,You need a higher upstream bandwith. This can be solved by having a better internet package/provider. For 720p you need about 2500KBit and some spares for your game 3000 KBit recommed. At 1080p you require at least 3000 to 3500 Kbit with spares about 4000.
Twitch,3d958a,Dashproject,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:10:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the fast reaction. Currently I can't have a better internet package/ provider, but isn't there anyway to increase the bandwith?"

Twitch,3d94k4,kammello,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"I would say the PC is fine (even over the top if we're talking about streaming, and not about the playability of the games). I am new, but in my testing have not had any issues with a Xeon 1230v3, an R9 290 and 8GB RAM.  Depending on what resolution you are planning on streaming on, I think you will run into issues with your bandwidth. I believe 3.5 mbps is what is recommended by Twitch, which allows for ok looking 1080p@30fps when streaming MOBAs or RPGs. If you're looking to stream FPS or action games at that resolution or any game at 60fps, your 5mbps will not be enough.  Only testing can really tell, though. Downscaling to 720p would also an option. My personal opinion is that a good looking 720p stream is better than a bad 1080p.  EDIT: Anyone with more experience than me (pretty much everyone on this subreddit :D), feel free to correct me if I'm wrong."

In testing on the demo stream I've found that the clip tends to start from 40 seconds prior to when I press the button and loses the final 10-12 seconds. i.e. I press the clip button when the countdown timer is at 15:00 - the clip starts at 15:40 and finishes around 15:11. Is that intentional?  Edit: teh

One was a girl named double crosser who was playing hearthstone with maybe a dozen viewers. They dropped 2-3000 people into her stream and they donated over $300. She is now partnered, has started streaming dota (The game played in the international), and just a few days ago did a 24-hour stream with a bunch of to scene personalities and raised almost three grand for the Alzheimer's association."

But yeah, as someone who experienced an incredibly positive raid, I think it's an awesome thing that bigger streamers can do for others to help them out. There's no way I would have the channel I do without the raid, and I think that positive raids can give huge opportunities to those who otherwise wouldn't have that kind of exposure."
Twitch,3d7qg8,TwitchDouble_Crosser,5,Tue Jul 14 13:34:18 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a tough spot. On one hand, you can really offer some good support to a streamer who might be having a hard time getting started, but on the other, it can scare the bejeezus out of them. I wish there was a way to get the message out that there can be good raids, and that they shouldn't be afraid of all of them.  For my streams, I've put one of my mods in charge of finding raid ""targets"". Usually, the targets themselves are fans of the show, and so they're at least aware of the possibility, which makes my life easier. In the case of really new folks, however, I have previously sent someone in to tell them ahead of time; I know that kinda kills the spirit of the raid itself, but at least they can brace themselves for it."
Twitch,3d7qg8,Shado_Temple,2,Tue Jul 14 04:28:45 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I thought when I read his question. Just let them know and let them ease into it before the raid arrives. Especially if he's really new. And maybe wait for him to be more experienced and used to the Twitch community. Just write his name down somewhere if you liked the guy and want to help him out and wait a month or two until you raid him someday.

Twitch,3d7qg8,DLMousey,2,Tue Jul 14 05:00:09 2015 UTC,"Raiding - raiding is a GREAT way to support and network with fellow streamers. It allows your community to be introduced to casters you personally enjoy which will not only strengthen your bonds, but can help introduce you to other communities/games/etc. KEEP IN MIND! - Raiding CAN technically violate Twitch ToS (terms of service) and you CAN be rightfully reported. My advice - know your raid target. I don't recommend raiding some random channel as not everyone may receive a bulk of viewers the way you'd expect. Hopefully this information helps a bit :D Stream on!"
Twitch,3d7qg8,AurynMacmillan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:54:18 2015 UTC,"thank you, I never realized this, but I guess it can get you banned. It's better to be safe than sorry."
Twitch,3d7qg8,ShinyGoombah,2,Wed Jul 15 05:10:10 2015 UTC,"It's Definately a nice thing to do, I've been on streams before where there's been a raid and you can't help but feel happy for the streamer having a ton of views and followers being dropped on them, but I can Definately see how it could overwhelm someone who's a bit more shy and/or inexperienced, so it probably would help to know your target well, maybe even do a mini dry run with 10/15 friends see how they react to that.  As a small streamer myself I can only dream of being raided xD it'd be a dream come true, I absolutely love it when my chat goes wild and people get involved I'd be in heaven if I got raided fingers crossed"
Twitch,3d7qg8,AurynMacmillan,2,Tue Jul 14 13:05:48 2015 UTC,"People do this? That's awesome!... I mean sad that this guy may have been scared off, but the concept of raiding someone's stream is awesome! How might one go about enticing people to raid his stream? Perhaps some type of reward for raiders?"
Twitch,3d7qg8,AurynMacmillan,2,Tue Jul 14 13:30:14 2015 UTC,"I hardly see people raid. Most people do it for fun and on a whim. Sounds like these guys do it as a regular thing on their channel. Honestly it's the first time I've ever heard of that. The only issue with rewarding a raider is that because you never know when it's going to happen it's hard to do that, because you may not have the money to get them something. Especially if the person being raided is a small streamer with only a few viewers."
Twitch,3d7qg8,ShinyGoombah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah we do it all the time, we stream agar.io, a lot of our viewers are playing with us, and build connections with the other viewers, sending them to one location to keep playing is the best way to go about it, we find some one and tell them to type in rage raid or something along those lines, and follow if they like the streamer."
Twitch,3d7qg8,filskit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:17:24 2015 UTC,"Very cool! Just discovered agar.io the other day, will definitely be incorporating it into my streams on some level. Will probably play while I'm waiting on LoL load screens."
Twitch,3d7qg8,Destro190,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:00:03 2015 UTC,"The way we have done it now, is by building a connection with the streamer, whether it be from having them pop in the chat and talk to us, or we watch their stream prior."
Twitch,3d7qg8,DrunkieMunkie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:19:16 2015 UTC,"Very cool! I'll have to come check out your stream and be part of one of these raids. Sounds like it's a lot of fun, kind of like bar hopping with a bunch of mates."
Twitch,3d7qg8,TheUnreliableGamer,2,Wed Jul 15 22:07:20 2015 UTC,"I love watching streams where the streamer raids people. The reactions are PRICELESS! The last one I watched was Nightblue3 who raided 3 people back to back, and by the end of the raid they were all doing really stupid things that the raiders were requesting. It was great, it was hilarious, and if you guys enjoy it keep doing it.  One thing I noticed about this last situation is that you said he had only been streaming a week, and it was his 2 or 3 stream. That probably means he doesn't have a ton of extra time to stream, so don't beat yourself up too much for that."
Twitch,3d7qg8,cheesedoodleempire,2,Tue Jul 14 13:43:59 2015 UTC,"Dude, I LOVE being raided! My chat gets super excited, the raiders have a great time, everyone's a winner. It's a shame when you see streamers who are just totally not used to talking to larger groups of people completely retreat into themselves instead of embrace it and have fun with it."
Twitch,3d7qg8,DrunkAndInsane,2,Tue Jul 14 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I wouldn't feel bad about it for sure.  You can't control how people will react to even good things which you did.  If a viewer count greater than 2 makes him nervous and scares him off then streaming might not be his cup of tea."
Twitch,3d7qg8,OutsanityDotCom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:53:00 2015 UTC,"I have only just started to stream again, and so far i have had to change my heart rate a few times when i have received a Raid.  The adrenaline is real! I do however think that sometimes Raids will help streamers really realise if they are cut out for it or understand what they are really offering. I accept that a lot of streamers are there to enjoy the game online and offer the chance for others to watch, however i think you can learn a lot about yourself when your numbers do rise and you can understand if this really is what you want.  I think there was not a lot you could have done differently, in fact i think @Flaimbot summed it up well: ""Edit: what i try to say with this is that you have to be careful with who you raid. People at the bottom might be the most thankful, but they are the easiest to break unintentionally""  dM"
Twitch,3d7qg8,Flaimbot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:14:19 2015 UTC,"Here's the way I see it. If you're looking for someone small to raid. Make sure their stream looks presentable and they look confident and are already having fun. A long time ago a guy ended up raiding me . At the time It was maybe my second ever stream and much like the first one everything looked awful because I never had anyone telling me about how bad it looked and I was so new I didn't know how to optimize anything, I also didn't have panels set up or a picture. The whole thing looked like I just randomly decided to stream without any care, which at the time I did. So like 10 people came in with him and I was nervous but I kept my cool however the audio and and video just looked and sounded god awful.most people left within 5 minutes and maybe one followed me, and at least 2 stuck around more than 10... I wish I could get a redo of that raid now that my stream at least looks mostly professional and not like a pile of dog turd.   So if you're going to raid someone, don't waste people's time. Raid the smaller channels who have been small for a long time and at least look like they know what they're doing. The brand new people still need time to figure everything out. Its like if you working on a new product and someone pushed you to sell it in a beta stage. Yeah a few people will buy it, but they will probably never use it more than once due to its shoddy looks compared to if it at least looks presentable."
Twitch,3d7qg8,MrSlyProductions,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:21:08 2015 UTC,"I once was raided by 4chan and it wasn't so bad (you know, minus all the shoe on head stuff!) It upped my view count and a few of the guys stuck around!   One of my friends was raided by a big-name Dota streamer and went from about 100 to 600 followers overnight. Never seen him happier. :3 Now just waiting for my turn someday."
Twitch,3d7qg8,DrunkieMunkie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:01:19 2015 UTC,I was raided by a great medium streamer and it was the best time of my life! I want to be raided again.... So much interaction in the chat and they helped me build a better character in ESO.  But then once I sent a raid off from my stream of about 20+ viewers and the guy we raided didn't even notice. He wasn't watching his chat and people left. If I get a chance to raid again I will look for a good streamer who is watching their chat and seems like they are having a good time.
Twitch,3d7qg8,i_make_doors,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:00:08 2015 UTC,"See, I thought the idea of the host feature was to kinda stop or tone down all the big raids and all?"
Twitch,3d7qg8,MrSlyProductions,0,Wed Jul 15 05:17:15 2015 UTC,"Once i was raided by about 30 people on hitbox. That took traction so i went straight to 150 viewers (i assume people having viewbots) and with that to the frontpage. Before i was averaging at around 5. That was a shock to see what streaming could turn into if i really got up there, because i was overwhelmed by the chat. Long story short i took a few weeks break to evaluate whether that was something i would like seeing everyday at a certain point. I was about to stop forever, but i caught myself. So i can see that your raidtarget decided that having such an experience was not what he would like to deal with. Natural selection at its finest.    Edit: what i try to say with this is that you have to be careful with who you raid. People at the bottom might be the most thankful, but they are the easiest to break unintentionally"
Twitch,3d8ydi,da_reflexa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:50:59 2015 UTC,Th heart next to your stream is your total # of followers.
Twitch,3d8ydi,SciGlass,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:53:11 2015 UTC,I know. But i want like a total followergoal in my stream. It has to say followergoal 74/125. Now it says 5/10 and resets everyday. I can edit the 10 part it can be 5/125 but i want it to show my total followers in the screen.
Twitch,3d8ydi,Ramautso,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:00:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure you can just use the Twitch Alerts app, but not reset it so that it doesn't reset the counter back to zero. I think you might be able to edit the .txt file to change it to the number you want to start at, and then each follower subsequently increments it - if not, you'll have to start at zero"

Twitch,3d8sj5,at_netherbrain,0,Tue Jul 14 11:58:59 2015 UTC,I guess just getting a start to a viewerbase
Twitch,3d8sj5,AvalonAngel84,2,Tue Jul 14 12:22:45 2015 UTC,I stopped by your stream today. It seems you don't have a microphone. People will rarely watch a stream that lacks a microphone.
Twitch,3d8sj5,AvalonAngel84,0,Tue Jul 14 14:43:07 2015 UTC,"I've got one, just didn't feel like using it today"
Twitch,3d8sj5,Growlibi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:07:01 2015 UTC,Well then don't be surprised that no one is watching.  You're supposed to entertain people with your stream and watching somebody constantly alt-tabbing to chat cuz he didn't feel like using a mic is not entertaining.   Viewers don't magically appear. You need to put in some effort.
Twitch,3d8sj5,ShinyGoombah,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:26:34 2015 UTC,Do some research.  Finding a game with lots of viewers and low amount of channels will guarrantee you some viewers atleast.  Do things in game that will make people WANT to watch you instead of being like every other stream  And find a place where you can reach out to people that may have never heard of Twitch or are plain interested in the category (for me this was /r/zelda )
Twitch,3d8sj5,Jesuswept669,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:05:40 2015 UTC,"One thing I would suggest, and I thought it was dumb until I actually tried it. Make your title interesting. I don't know what game(s) you play, but I'm sure there is some way you can make a title sound more intriguing. I'll give you an example. I am playing Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix right now, and I got to a boss that is known for being a pain. So, I set my title to something along the lines of ""Fighting Roxas! Come watch me die a thousand times"" Sure enough people showed up. It's all about taking a simple title and adding to it to make it seem more than it really is."

Twitch,3d8oxu,Pick_Nick101,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:39:50 2015 UTC,I would try lowering bitrate to 2000. Twitch seems to have been causing issues for none partners the last week. Any stream above 2500 bitrate cause all the streams to buffer and eventually stop for me when I watch them. :S
Twitch,3d8n2t,BaneWilliams,4,Tue Jul 14 10:43:57 2015 UTC,"1) No, you will always use the same bandwith depending on your settings, not on your viewer count. Twitch cares about distributing the stream to all Viewers. So Twitch needs more bandwith the more people are watching you, but that's not really something you have to worry about.  2) No need for such a service because of 1. However if you want to stream to several services (Twitch, Hitbox, ...) at the same time, there are services for that. If you're interested in that, just send me a pm. Not sure if it is allowed to cross promote such services in this subreddit, although it is nothing illegal to stream to several services at the same time (except you signed some agreement in a contract or so).  3) don't know, sry. Someone else has to answer that. But I have to say, a 10 second delay is good ... I face something like 20+ secs really often."

I initially started creating content on youtube with that platform as my primary, but in May I gave streaming a shot and fell in love.   I have many of the same thoughts as you. I don't have much time to dedicate to actually recording content specifically for YouTube - so I want to utilize content from my stream but I want to do so in a quality way.   I'm still not sure.   One thing I plan to do is be more cognizant of my ""good moments"" that I can highlight later, since I'm not sure that throwing up a 6 hour stream (even broken into 15-30 min chunks) is necessarily what people would want on YouTube.

Twitch,3d7tj6,Jokosmash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:07:57 2015 UTC,I'm using 64 bit obs and 64 bit CLR. But i also tried installing the 32 bit CLR browser with the 32 bit OBS and they still don't work. I also installed all the pre requisites.  I even uninstalled and reinstalled :\
Twitch,3d7tj6,Jokosmash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:28:19 2015 UTC,"Okay, so just to clarify, are you at least able to add a CLR Browser scene to OBS and include the TwitchAlerts URL in the scene's properties?"
Twitch,3d7tj6,Jokosmash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:31:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have the option to add the CLR Browser & I add the TwitchAlert url but still nothing shows up. I also use the NightDev OBS chat, but that is not working now either."
Twitch,3d7tj6,Jokosmash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:42:28 2015 UTC,They were all working perfectly fine before the OBS update a few days ago. So I honestly have no idea what happened or how to fix it.
Twitch,3d7tj6,Jokosmash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:43:02 2015 UTC,"Hm, log out of Twitch and log back in. Then, goto Nightbot and Twitch Alerts, and do the same (logout, then log back in). There may be some issues with your token connecting to each service for some reason.  Also, at TwitchAlerts, goto the http://www.twitchalerts.com/dashboard/api-settings page (after you've logged out and back in) and refresh your API Access token.  Once you refresh your API access token, you'll need to copy & paste a new URL from your Twitch alerts into CLR Browser scene, because the URL will have been updated.  Try that and let me know if that works."

They also have ""labels"" that you can integrate into your OBS to show more stats and you don't have to open a million windows to have them show up on your OBS.  Twitch Alerts takes a % of your donations every time you get one, but Stream Tip invoices you ONLY if you meet a certain threshold. I.e., you won't pay a % on a single $10.00 donation if you don't make $x amount of dollars in a month.  Also, I'm not sure about the support at Twitch Alerts (haven't needed it yet), but Stream Tip's FAQ and ""self-serve help"" options are lacking."

The direction it comes in on, how it appears, the looks, the sound that's made.  If you're good with Java you could do some wild things with it.  Or if your like me and you want to customize only the appearance or the sound alerts.  No coding experience needed.  It even has follower, subscriber, and donation alerts.  The best part is once it's working I've never had a problem like it didn't work when somebody followes, i heared twitch alerts has this issue but since I dont use twitch alert I cannot say much more on this topic.  Donations do not touch teeboard so you aren't charged through teeboard.  However it only works through imraising which does take 2% of the donation and then sends it to paypal which takes another 2% or so."

Check your Audio tab in OBS' settings and see if Mic/Aux Boost is set higher than 1. If so, turn it down.

Twitch,3d78vz,chuxsux,3,Tue Jul 14 01:49:41 2015 UTC,In OBS allow the capture card to play audio to the desktop and plug your headphones into your PC. This is what I do for all my consoles. Works flawlessly while OBS has preview/stream/recording going.

I'm not sure how it's solved in OBS, but you can easily solve it in XSPLIT by right clicking the source and refreshing it.  I have to assume that OBS has something similar.    I got into the habit of refreshing my C985 about every 1 hr until I basically replaced it with a USB3.0 external alternative.    So, basically, yes you're not crazy!

Twitch,3d6l2e,Epileptic_Toad,2,Mon Jul 13 22:41:51 2015 UTC,You should probably invest in a HDD to save all of the files. HDD's are pretty cheap now-a-days. You won't need to re-download them if you store them locally!
Twitch,3d6l2e,riseyyy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:50:00 2015 UTC,I was considering that yeah but I always fear the hardware crash. Maybe I should do both Youtube in case of issue and HDD for easy access.  I just hope Youtube will be ok with 50GB of data uploaded every month (on top of other stuff).  Thanks :)
Twitch,3d6l2e,hubsmash,2,Mon Jul 13 23:19:15 2015 UTC,YouTube won't compress your files much because your local recordings are likely the same bitrate as your stream. YouTube usually drops it down to about 8-10k bitrate for 1080p I think - so you should be totally fine and shouldn't notice much quality loss if any.   I would try it out. You can always keep them private until you're ready to publish something.   As for what to do with them - beyond that or buying more storage I can't offer much opinion on the subject.   If I were in your scenario I'd upload em to YouTube :)  If you are recording locally at 30k bitrate or something while streaming then yeah you'll lose quality.
Twitch,3d6l2e,OutsanityDotCom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:51:38 2015 UTC,"Weird, the last time I tried downloading a file I had uploaded myself on Youtube, it gave me a very bad quality one (like 360p or 480p one). But now that's I'm quickly checking downloading some of the highlights I've already uploaded there, it seems that they have indeed the same quality as the original.  Well I guess that's the best solution indeed. That or buy a new HDD as soon as one is full xD  Thanks anyway :)  I'm still curious as to what other streamers do with their broadcast if they store them?"
Twitch,3d6l2e,OutsanityDotCom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:17:42 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced most streamers don't even local record. They just export to YT making them miss out on the fun of video editing.  Also, I think, with OBS at least, you can have different video settings for your strem and local recording. They don't have to be the same since local recording is a separate button you would press to start and ending a local video while streaming."
Twitch,3d6l2e,hubsmash,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:30:53 2015 UTC,I just use the auto local save when streaming so it's the same quality as the stream. Not sure how OBS (and my CPU) would handle both recording and streaming (with different settings) at the same time.  But maybe you're right and I'm one of the few recording all the casts locally?
Twitch,3d6l2e,OutsanityDotCom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:52 2015 UTC,"I like local recording because figure this: A streamer can have  maybe 10 funny highlights from a broadcast that might be about a minute or under but if they put them together as a single video, that I would watch versus the VOD system. But, that's me."
Twitch,3d6l2e,hubsmash,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:14:00 2015 UTC,Do you know how to actually record at different bitrates or are you just theorizing? I would love to record at 15k or something and still stream at the 2k bitrate - but I didn't think it was possible without using a second way to capture at the same time.
Twitch,3d6l2e,catdragonnamedrose,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:49:52 2015 UTC,"I believe, last I remembered, there are separate settings in OBS for streaming and local recording. I did somehow find a guide but it says you need two copies of OBS which, to me, sounds semi-complicated for something that should be rather simple to do in just one instance of the program.    In the OBS settings, go to Output and switch it from Simple to Advanced. There should be 3 sections now (Streaming, Recording and Audio). Go to Recording and put that from Standard to Custom Output. At that point you just need to set the folder the local video will go, bitrate of the video and audio bitrate (also the Rescale Output if needed). I would say if you want to make sure it works to your liking, test it out a little."

Twitch,3d5nqi,Heep123,3,Mon Jul 13 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"8Ball You use the command and include a yes or no question as a parameter/argument. The bot responds with an answer. For example:     User: !8ball Am I awesome? Bot: Magic 8ball says: Of Course!     Roulette This command is basically just a chance to show off your luck. You send the command, and have a 50% chance of being timed out. For example:     User: !roulette Bot: /timeout User <time> // User survived!      Seppuku Seppuku just times you out... yay!  For example:     Me: !seppuku Bot: /timeout User <time>     Love You send the command and the bot returns a percentage of love between you and the person specified.

Twitch,3d6jl5,near_oh,3,Mon Jul 13 22:30:20 2015 UTC,"Just checked one of your previous stream and your FPS never drop under 100 and your ping is solid. So I don't really see where the issue is?  If you feel a difference while streaming and since your connection is good enough, my guess would be that your CPU might be overloaded. Did you check the CPU use while streaming (or while doing a test)?  What you could try is:   reduce the bitrate (it's too much anyway for a non partner streamer, a lot of people are probably not able to watch your stream because of that) to 2000 or lower. stream at 30fps (so that the quality isn't too bad with the lowered bitrate) capture your game with ""game capture"" instead of ""window capture"". check the advance settings in OBS and see if the x264 encoding is on superfast or higher.   All those will have an impact on the CPU use and you should be able to see if that's what's causing the FPS dips you are feeling."
Twitch,3d6jl5,Epileptic_Toad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:08:19 2015 UTC,Well I think I've got it figured out mildly.  I had to keep csgo in full screen windowed mode.  720p at 30fps.

CPU: AMD FX-8350 Black 4.2GHz   This is one (possible) problem in my opinion. AMD CPUs are good for multicore applications such as video encoding... but the single-thread performance is pretty much terrible compared to modern Intel chips. Now I'm not exactly sure how many cores CSGO can utilize and how CPU-intensive the game is in general... but this might be something to keep in mind.   Other than that, unless your internet connection is giving you problems while streaming (high ping), Game Capture is the only obvious thing I could see - but since you said it was the same as Window Capture - if not worse - that's probably not it either."

Twitch,3d42hr,HellManGaming,12,Mon Jul 13 10:32:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's mostly about stream ownership, supervision, and contracts. There is also the children's online privacy protection act which summarizes to ""companies can't collect personal information of children under 13 unless their parent has given permission"".   Edit: forgot to link https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act  So, if you own the account, your daughter is not a twitch user, and you are supervising - I think you'll be ok.   It's not much different than having a guest visit the stream with you. Or if you were to put up YouTube videos with your daughter in them.   I'm not twitch staff - this is just how I imagine they would see it."
Twitch,3d42hr,hubsmash,8,Mon Jul 13 10:58:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend it. It's a good idea, really refreshing and watching a father and daughter playing together would be cute to watch. But we all know all the weirdos who are on twitch, she will receive comments you don't want to read."
Twitch,3d42hr,TheRedViper85,9,Mon Jul 13 12:16:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's all about mod team and supervision. Don't let your daughter read chat. If the father has been on twitch for any length of time he should know to ignore any filth that gets said and not let it get to him.   I think it's an awesome idea and I was considering doing this with my son (4 years old right now) and he watches fgeetv on YouTube and really wants to record his own stuff (with my help and supervision of course)  Even the heaviest moderated chat would not be appropriate to let a 6 yr old read, imo. If he gets partnered he can put it on sub only and in that case it MIGHT be ok. Or he can pull out the things people say that are positive and relay them to her.   I don't think as a community we should discourage this at all - I think it just requires some extra thought into how everything is set up and I hope op does it (if you do op, pls pm me and I'll come hang out or tweet at me @hubsmash)"
Twitch,3d42hr,hubsmash,2,Mon Jul 13 12:55:20 2015 UTC,"The thing about weirdos is true, but still, the parent would be responsible to either configure spamfilter/bot/... or just hide the chat. In the end you as a parent are in charge of what your kid sees and what not. I mean there are weirdos all over the internet .. and children definitely have access to all kind of stuff before the age of 13 as soon as they own a smartphone ;)  In my opinion I even think it would be a good thing. Because she'll probably learn how to responsibly use and behave on twitch and such services from her father, even if the main point is not educating the child here. She would just start to mimic the behavior of the parent, so if the father behaves responsible, I'd expect the kid to get a similar behavior. That's at least what my 1 1/2 year old does ... already hammering her hands on the keyboard and having fun when she sees letters apear ... though I don't show her on stream mainly because I start to stream when she's already asleep. But you could observe she's already imitating my behavior (as good as she can :D ).  tl;dr Weirdos -> true Still parents can protect children from insults and stuff."

My soon to be 4yr old daughter interr... uh walks in on my streaming all the time, and because I stream so many hours in a day I decided that I would allow her to play a small role in my cast rather than shoo her away so I will sit her on my laap, place the headset on her ears and let her play for a few minutes. My community adores her, and because she can't read anything I feel there is no harm done.   Now, with your specific situation is she just going to be playing the game alongside you as you stream and handle the chat? If so I dont think this is an issue, however I would not under any circumstances give her access to read the chat and instead leave that to you, and your moderators."
Twitch,3d42hr,Docgotgame,0,Tue Jul 14 01:04:19 2015 UTC,"Because you're basically the actual streamer and the adult to accompany her, I don't really see much problem with it.

Twitch,3d6f4b,Ashadur,2,Mon Jul 13 21:57:37 2015 UTC,"As a non partner streamer you'll want to stream at a bitrate around 1500-2000kbps. That means an upload of 4-5MB is sufficient for that. Don't expect crystal clear quality though; that's the current problem with Twitch: even with a good enough upload you can't stream at a very high quality without the risk people will buffer (either because they don't have the sufficient bandwidth or, most likely, because Twitch servers aren't able to deliver your stream to everyone).  Even with a 50% reduction, you would still be at 2-2.5MB so 1500-1800kbps would still be possible.  I personally stream at 1500kbps which is around 750MB per hour so you would be under your cap (but then you would have to add some upload if you are playing multiplayer games). So I guess it's just a matter of testing but that seems to be good enough ;)"

Be careful not to clear your throat aggressively and avoid coughing if you feel like something is stuck (try to cough without activating your voice instead). Use hard candies instead of throat lozenges if you need soothing, as the lozenges often contain harsh ingredients that can further irritate your voice! Practice good breathing (use good posture and make sure your breath is coming from your diaphragm and not your shoulder area) and try not to use a loud voice (as StrykerNoStriking said, adjust your mic volume instead). Make sure you give your voice a good rest in the hours you're not streaming (as long as you're able) - a good rule of thumb is to have quiet hours a few hours before you go to bed.  It may also benefit you to do some vocal warmups before you stream too. Here's a good list of these tips and more that should hopefully help you.  MOST IMPORTANTLY though, if you don't notice any change or things get worse, go visit an ENT doctor to make sure there isn't an underlying problem with your vocal cords!"

I'll make sure to remember a few of these and start putting them into practice.  I'm weening myself off of the sugary and caffeinated drinks. Down to one a day, which is a lot better than before.  Trying to train myself to drink water more frequently. Do you have any resources for breathing exercises or how to tell if you are breathing right? I feel like I breathe from the diaphram but wonder if I may not be in reality.  My voice is almost back to normal now, but I am still slightly sick so that might be hindering it.

You want to make sure your stomach is what rises! It's pretty easy to intuitively change once you see how you're breathing, but this may help if you're having trouble (and don't worry about that link, I don't think you have pulmonary issues haha)!"

Twitch,3d5c6v,Shado_Temple,2,Mon Jul 13 20:12:34 2015 UTC,"Hahaha thanks! It was terrifying until I had him, and now it's pretty awesome. I took a long break from streaming and have only just over the past few days started trying to hop back in the game. It's not an energy thing as much as a timing thing. I never know when he's gonna decide to nap and I can never be sure that he won't wake up starving 15 minutes later haha. He's just 2 months old though, so hopefully we'll fall more into a routine soon."
Twitch,3d5c6v,lunchkat,3,Mon Jul 13 23:05:33 2015 UTC,"This is some great advice! Quick question: when I got into streaming, I've been habitually having a cup of tea (no sweeteners) with every broadcast. While I do enjoy the feeling of a hot drink on a heavily-worked throat, is the caffeine content of said tea hurting me more than helping?"
Twitch,3d5c6v,iambgriffs,2,Mon Jul 13 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"Caffeine is okay in moderation, and I feel like the content in tea is negligible compared to coffee and soda (but I could be very wrong!). I always tell my patients with coffee habits that I don't expect them to quit cold turkey or cut it out at all. Just cut back a little - if you drink four cups a day, try going down to two. If you really like the warmth and feel like trying it out, warm water with honey and lemon is supposed to be soothing without the potential damaging effects of caffeine. But a cup or two a day shouldn't be a problem, and if it's the only factor contributing to a voice problem there's more than likely something bigger going on with the vocal mechanism!"
Twitch,3d5c6v,LoneSloth,3,Mon Jul 13 20:02:23 2015 UTC,I drink water all day including during the stream to keep hydrated. I also do phone based tech support so I'm talking all day. Haven't lost my voice yet! knock on wood
Twitch,3d5c6v,StrykerNoStriking,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:37:03 2015 UTC,Thanks bud! I'm going to just have to train myself to drink more water :D Best of luck!
Twitch,3d5c6v,StrykerNoStriking,2,Mon Jul 13 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"Also, you shouldn't have to talk very loud at all. Talk at your comfortable normal volume and take breaks. Quality over quantity. I'd much rather hear some hilarious/skillful stuff than you rambling or making random comments about stuff. You'll get a feel for it. Turn up your mic if they can't hear you that well."
Twitch,3d5c6v,StrykerNoStriking,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:05:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks again :D I'm very much a laid back streamer and I have my audio down. I completely agree though, and having a good setup (and knowing how to use it) helps a ton!"
Twitch,3d5c6v,Tenthisle,3,Mon Jul 13 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"I lost my voice to tonsilitis once and still streamed. Worst. Decision. Ever.   ...then again, apparently it was a pretty funny cast, with one of my viewers giving me lines from Lord of the Rings and Batman to read in my shredded voice--so that was fun. Still, hurt like the devil and kept me home recovering an extra day.  Basically, drink lots of water and avoid sugary drinks to keep your voice intact--singer's trick there, with the soda-avoidance--and if you do lose your voice, don't force it. Oh, and see if you can adjust your mic so you're not needing to yell--it'll preserve your voice for longer."
Twitch,3d5c6v,StrykerNoStriking,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:52:32 2015 UTC,"Oh man it hurts really bad >.< I took my Friday stream off and had the weekend to recover, so it came at a good time I guess.  I'm pretty bad with the sugary drinks. down to one a day at lunch time. I've been drinking some hot teas which seem to help recover as well. I appreciate the tips though :D  I have my mic 6-8"" from my mouth and have it hooked up to a pretty nice sound board and the levels set so that I don't have to yell. I'm not a screamer streamer, which helps as well xD Thanks again!  As a singer, do you feel vocal warm-ups help? If so do you have any tips for those?"
Twitch,3d5c6v,DrunkieMunkie,2,Mon Jul 13 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"Tea is a godsend. Tea with a smidgeon of honey in it is even better for sore throats, though you'd think it wouldn't with the whole sugary drinks thing. And I'm bad at not drinking soda, too, but it does make a difference.  Caveat to the singing: I sang in my church choir, took lessons for a year and a half, and have been told I sing well. (I also played the flute for 15 years, which does require similar breathing/vocal chord use, oddly enough.)  But as a former-singer-now-streamer, yes, I find vocal warmups help. I'll often take a shower before stream and sing Disney songs to my shower head or on the ride home from work. Your throat has muscles that should be prepared properly before a workout. Would a marathon runner run a race without doing a lap or two before the start? No, or else he'd be cramped up and hurt before he got halfway through. Warming up has been a great way for me to get my ""radio voice"" up and going from the first minute."
Twitch,3d5bt4,DailyProblem,3,Mon Jul 13 17:22:32 2015 UTC,Change your IP - explain to your ISP what's happening and they will likely do this for free.   Alternatively you can try leaving your modem unplugged for 30 min or so and then plug it back in. It might grab a new IP

Yes, I do not have any idea what I am talking about. That is why I am asking the internet."
Twitch,3d5bt4,notR1CH,2,Tue Jul 14 21:46:06 2015 UTC,"Your router is just listing random packets that it doesn't understand. This is most likely a legitimate server you have accessed in the past, your connection timed out or otherwise disconnected on your end, but the remote server is still trying to send you packets. Your router doesn't realize it used to be an old connection and thus lists the IP as an ""attack"" since it doesn't know any better.  Most firewall protections in routers are useless because they don't have enough CPU or memory to maintain a full connection state table, so it would benefit you by disabling it if you are actually being attacked.  To stop the attack though you need to change your IP and prevent it from being leaked, which most likely involves not using Skype and not clicking on weird links or using IRC."

If we're talking about services for Twitch users too, then Streamtip already offers support for Coinbase wallets, in addition to PayPal. We also have a third payment gateway deal in the works that would also levy no chargebacks for broadcasters.  Coinbase allows you to also auto-convert funds to your local currency and export to your bank, so if you don't want to deal with BTC or its (somewhat) unstable market this helps you with that. Viewers can also fund Coinbase accounts from their banks, similar to PayPal.  I'm a big fan of cryptocurrency because chargebacks are becoming an increasingly annoying side-effect of accepting payments online. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually further restrictions get placed on chargebacks (especially with new innovations like virtual card numbers that services like Apple Pay employ)."

We could always write our own android app and force viewer that want to donate to download the app... mh.. maybe I just should start selling apps to streamers that do that :D

Twitch,3d4w3g,Gokudera,5,Mon Jul 13 15:27:45 2015 UTC,"Someone please feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken, but this is how I understand the situation thus far:  Ultimately, there is no 100% way to make donations non-refundable. If a person donates to you and then files for a charge-back, the company that handles their finances essentially takes the money back right away. PayPal then processes this and forwards that information to you letting you know.  You can dispute this charge-back, but if you do and fail (which you are almost certainly going to), then you are charged a fee for each appeal (something like $25/appeal).  Posting a disclaimer (posting mine as an example; please do not donate) on your donation page increases the chances of your appeal going through, but ultimately the most hassle-free option is to leave the donation money in your PayPal for some period of time (3-6 months, I've heard) before withdrawing it. After a certain period of time, the chargeback cannot be filed anymore and your money is safe to withdraw.  As a last layer of defense, you can also use StreamTip, which will blacklist users from ever donating to you again if they issue a chargeback."

We kind of like the idea of keeping this editor free, we just need to think of a way to keep supporting it. I think we're just going to listen to the users and ask you guys what you think we should do."
Twitch,3d4ui2,Blazin_Bullets15,2,Mon Jul 13 15:15:46 2015 UTC,Since your upload speed is ~5 you should meet the required bit rate to stream at either 1080p or 720p. You may also have to do some additional experimentation to check that your internet service provider (ISP) can work efficiently with the Twitch servers.
Twitch,3d4ui2,SamClose1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:26:06 2015 UTC,5 up should be good enough for a nice 720p stream. Best of luck!

Twitch,3d4nwe,cdarius16,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:23:06 2015 UTC,"Personal preference. I have two monitors but one of them is able to go into vertical/portrait mode. Saves some desk space and also is just really great for reading chat and has plenty of room. I find it better for observational stuff and not being the active monitor.  I don't know much about the Samsung Meteor and to be honest; unless you're an audiophile or extremely picky, the mics will get to a certain point where you won't be able to notice much difference. For example a Blue Snowball and an AT2020 will have a fairly noticeable difference but an AT2020 and a Blue Yeti are more comparable. The best difference comes from your recording environment and editing settings such as a noise gate. I use the AT2020 and have found that one to be amazing. Just do your research and go from there, that's what I did.  As for stands, most higher end mics come with adapters so they can fit a variety of stands. I use THIS ONE and really like it. Popfilter wise though, I don't think there'd be TOO much of a difference between them. Some might last longer than others but I'm sure you can pick any and be fine. Someone more knowledgeable can tell me otherwise xD  As for tips there are plenty of those floating around. Again, being resourceful is good so just look around :). Having a set schedule is a good thing and if you're able to stream the amount you mentioned, you have a good chance of growth!  My main tip for people starting out now would be to not get caught up in all the shiny things. The notifiers, graphics, etc. I think people nowadays look at the larger channels and assume you won't get anywhere without that kind of stuff. They can help, but no sense in getting ahead of yourself. The main thing is to just,  BE ONLINE. Really. The more you're online, the more people will see you. Simple as that.  Hope this helps!"
Twitch,3d4nwe,Dancingg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:22:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for all the help and tips ! I think I will be looking for a stand similar to the one you .
Twitch,3d4nwe,GiiRR,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"Best of luck to you when you get to start streaming! I currently use Audio Technica ATR 2500 and I believe it is an amazing condenser mic. It also cost less than its suppressor. As far as second monitor, it is quite useful to stream. In my opinion, doesn't really matter what you use as your second monitor. Heck I still use a classic 17"" LCD monitor because I don't have the funds to pay for another monitor. Good luck!"

Twitch,3d6dn5,Accident_Pedo,2,Mon Jul 13 22:00:40 2015 UTC,I used to feel that way. I'm starting to think it's lowering the quality of streamers we see 'make it' because decent people give up trying to make it through the horde of < 2 viewers.
Twitch,3d6dn5,Accident_Pedo,2,Mon Jul 13 22:05:07 2015 UTC,but if you keep working you'll regardless pass them up eventually.
Twitch,3d6dn5,riseyyy,5,Mon Jul 13 22:06:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think they should disappear (even though I agree with a lot of your points). However, you do bring up a good point about listing them separately."
Twitch,3d6dn5,luckyariane,2,Mon Jul 13 22:12:09 2015 UTC,"I have seen very few console streams like you described but many many PC streams like that.   I don't think it's an issue with console streaming. With streaming becoming more accessible, more people are going to start streaming and more of them will be low quality. It's a cross platform issue."
Twitch,3d6dn5,SamuraiENIX,0,Mon Jul 13 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the game. If you go down the list of BF4, for example, you will see a ton of console streams. More and more games are being released cross platform which means more and more streams are coming directly from the console.    Exposure definitely plays a part but on PC you have to put more effort into getting a stream going. It's not just enter your stream key and press go."
Twitch,3d6dn5,SamuraiENIX,2,Mon Jul 13 22:15:23 2015 UTC,"Often times I'll just stream a game for my girlfriend to watch at her place. Sometimes I'll stream for others and cater to them if I feel like it. If people don't like it, I honestly don't give a shit. I'm a grown man with a job and I use Twitch however the hell I want.  If you are trying to turn Twitch streaming into a career, it's going to start feeling like a career as you fight with other streamers to gain viewership. Complaining about other people gets you nowhere in life and you sure as hell won't get away with it at a real job."
Twitch,3d6dn5,Oremm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:24:13 2015 UTC,This is definitely not about turning streaming into a career. It's about the sheer number of streams coming from consoles that put no effort into the hobby. That in turn makes it more difficult for new streamers that are putting effort into the hobby and eventually get discouraged. I've read stories of people on here stuck at 0 - 2 viewers for months. I think it lowers the quality of Twitch as a whole.
Twitch,3d6dn5,CronoRegen,0,Mon Jul 13 22:29:00 2015 UTC,Well I think the answer your looking for could be with user submitted channel ratings. Maybe an algorythm that moves highly active channels to the top of the search list as well.  There's no way to prevent people from using free services for fun though.
Twitch,3d6dn5,Mr_Quackums,2,Mon Jul 13 22:31:48 2015 UTC,user submitted channel ratings   twinge.tv
Twitch,3d6dn5,bluesmcgroove,2,Mon Jul 13 22:33:36 2015 UTC,"I think there is definitely a better way of formatting this so twitch could utilize it as feedback. Just try to be less confrontational about it. You don't have to call the channels low quality, easy-mode, or no effort.       It's nothing more than a cancer filling up the channel list.     If I read your post as is, I feel as if you are just complaining about design and that twitch should cater to all your needs. An alternative way of putting it would be:    I think there should be a to filter out console streaming when I browse twitch channels. Then explain how it can be kind of cluttered when browsing low viewer count channels."
Twitch,3d6dn5,Lostsoldier23,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:35:17 2015 UTC,Political correctness should not affect whether or not something can be utilized as feedback. Either others agree with me or not.  Thanks for the free lesson though.

Twitch,3d6dn5,Oremm,2,Tue Jul 14 02:24:09 2015 UTC,"""You're a dumb fuck and your opinion is stupid"" is way less constructive than ""Maybe you need to think about things a little different, man""   Sure, the same point gets across, but if I call you a dumb fuck you probably won't listen to me, if I suggest more politely that you should be a little more open minded, though? You're probably more apt to hear what I have to say.  It's not a matter of ""political correctness"" it's a matter of speaking in a way that might encourage someone to listen."
Twitch,3d6dn5,Imagine42,-1,Tue Jul 14 05:55:16 2015 UTC,"It is written in a blunt fashion. No one was called stupid or a dumb fuck. If people get offended by that post I can't imagine how offended they would get in other aspects of life.    If you are putting no effort into your channel and ignoring chat, you are a cancer to the channel listing. That's about as nice as I would put it."
Twitch,3d6dn5,Oremm,2,Tue Jul 14 06:20:30 2015 UTC,I couldn't disagree with this more. Although I am biased as I am a console streamer. I love it and I put effort into it.   One of the first things i check out when entering a channel is the Bio. If there's no Bio I generally leave because obviously this person is just streaming for the sake of it and because they can. At least in my opinion.  You also mention this is making it difficult for new streamers to get noticed and that they then lose interest in their hobby? Well if it's just a hobby then they wouldn't care and would keep at it.  Anyway I do get some of your points but I disagree they should be separated. They are still playing the same game you are looking up. Just maybe start checking out the Info first before committing :)
Twitch,3d6dn5,SexyFishHorse,0,Tue Jul 14 02:04:14 2015 UTC,"That's one way to do it but I have stopped wasting my time trying to sort through the mess. I wonder how many others have done the same. Ultimately I don't think it's good for Twitch.    The fact that it is just a hobby doesn't stop people from getting discouraged. Eventually some just feel like it is a lost cause. Like I said, there has been posts on here with people stuck in that horde of 0 viewers for months. They had a face cams and second monitors. I'm glad I don't have to start out right now..."

I plan on saving money to fix my stream up and make it better so I won't have to stream off my xbox anymore, but I make do with this. Most people in my chat don't seem to mind the problems that come with it. I think it's unfair to remove console streaming. This has created an opportunity for people who only have consoles or don't PC game to join the Twitch community. Taking that away would be a huge mistake."
Twitch,3d6dn5,SexyFishHorse,2,Tue Jul 14 04:36:11 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear that you put so much effort into your stream.

Twitch,3d6dn5,sketchymidnight,2,Mon Jul 13 23:04:54 2015 UTC,"I do have all whispers disabled in BTTV.  But I moderate for a decent-sized channel, where whisper-trolls have been a problem lately.  Users are still not fully aware of what the system is and how it works, and there has already been backlash that ""the mods aren't doing their jobs"" and ""the chat in here is getting intolerable.""  The caster even lost subscriptions thanks to these events."
Twitch,3d6dn5,TheMissingLink5,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:08:07 2015 UTC,It's not only used for bad stuff.

Twitch,3d6dn5,TheMissingLink5,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:09:29 2015 UTC,I know that there are plenty of good uses for it - but the fact that there is zero moderation on something that is being inserted into the chat has given the bad side of things too much leeway.

Twitch,3d6dn5,matter1317,2,Tue Jul 14 07:22:14 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your partnership. I think you're in the extreme minority but I don't have any stats to back that up. I've just never seen a partnered streamer streaming from console. I bet you would have still made it to the same position listed separately though.    The ones I take issue with are the streamers not making any effort and essentially wasting bandwidth. I notice it more coming from consoles than PCs, at least in the games I watch."
Twitch,3d6dn5,matter1317,2,Tue Jul 14 07:33:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you I appreciate that a lot. I don't know what has been done to put me in the extreme minority but it only took a few days to really blow up. Didnt have anything more than gameplay + a microphone when it happened. I think a few MKX players stream straight from their PS4 actually, but I may be the fastest to have been partnered doing it.   Regardless, I mean if they're wasting bandwidth and aren't putting effort in... They're only soaking up in the ~2 views section. If you can't get past that in the first place it doesn't really matter does it? I'm not sure. I can scroll through the top streamers lists for games and you'll see a distinct difference with the casual streamers and the people attempting to get a viewer base."
Twitch,3d4jsb,ZzerkzZ,6,Mon Jul 13 13:46:49 2015 UTC,"Just develop a consistent schedule and stick to it so people can count on you being there! Anytime is a good time really, unless you are targeting a specific region of the world."
Twitch,3d4jsb,GL1513,2,Mon Jul 13 13:54:53 2015 UTC,"This, really. There's folks on twitch at all hours and while it's possible to tailor your stream times to certain demographics, it's wildly more important to have a set schedule that you can make work always: people need to know that at X time on Y days, you're going to be there for them to watch."
Twitch,3d4jsb,fortrfire,4,Mon Jul 13 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"In case you only want to select 1 single day, I'd go through one of the following processes: Keep in mind that this is just the way I think about things. This is not something that can be considered a general best practice, but rather an attempt to apply a system to something as vague as selecting a time slot. I assume each and every day and time is equally ok for you ;)  1) If your target group is world wide... just what /u/GL1513 said  2) If you are targeting a specific region: - define your target group as well   find out what your target group is doing in freetime (everything you'll get there is vague information at best, but still it is better than just guessing without ANY information, in my opinion) E.g. If your target group is people between the age of 16 - 25, find out what they do ... probably going to a club at weekends, staying at home on week days With that information you should be able to guess a time slot where your target audience is most likely at home and willing to dedicate time to watching a stream .. that's the time slot you want to hit.  In the above examle (16 - 25 year olds), I'd assume I have better chances to get viewers on weekdays compared to weekends Last and most important point: Test the assumptions you made above, measure them and readjust. Especially when you start streaming, you don't have a huge community relying on you streaming on a certain day. So you are flexible in a way that you can switch days for testing purpose without having to fear that you lose a huge part of your community   3) If you don't care about target audience and location but about a certain game   Monitor the activity on that game. Number of channels, viewers per day/time Select a day/time where you have good chances of getting at least into the ""top row"" of the broadcasts shown when you navigate to that game through the twitch/directory page. That's what most people see and click. Keep in mind that if you play a game with low viewerbase at all, this approach won't help much. You would just hit the first row (first - fith place or sth like that) independent of day + time... but you'd still not get any viewers because with low viewerbase at the first place, who would ever come to click on your channel? Again, and I can't emphasis that more: Test and readjust as long as your community is not too big. You don't want to lose a huge part of your community later on :)"
Twitch,3d4jsb,at_netherbrain,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:19:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for specifying target audience and geography. Sure, there's folks on Twitch at all hours, but there's a larger English speaking audience at certain times over others--or a French one, or a Korean one."

Twitch,3d4f7u,One_Rocky,2,Mon Jul 13 16:04:01 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that if the streamer is part of a large team then the numbers could be coming from hosts. It's very common for multiple other channels to host others within the team which will boost live viewers but usually doesn't add much chat. It's obvious that viewbotting is an out-of-control problem but it doesn't mean 100% are doing it.    Rocky

Twitch,3d4f7u,at_netherbrain,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:10:47 2015 UTC,"tl;dr  I don't think you as a viewer or streamer can tell for sure if someone is viewbotted. At some point things get obvious though ;)  Hmm... I think everything you as a viewer/streamer could do is to make a ""best guess"" about whether someone is being viewebotted or not. But some indicators which give you a good sense of whether someone is viewbotted or not in my opinion: 1) Unusual high viewer count compared to other streaming sessions (ignore that for giveaway streams, they often naturally attract more people)  2) Many accounts with weird names. I'd assume such viewbots are created in a way that they generate twitch accounts. So choosing usernames would be most likely an act of randomly selecting alphanumeric characters. At least I as a software dev would do it that way ;) (although there are probably user name dictionaries out there which a sophisticated bot could use).  3) Many new accounts in the stream. Don't expect a viewbotter to only bot you with one single account. That's not worth the risk and effort. So there should be kind of a pattern if you browse the viewers audience (many viewers with near to no follows, 0 followers, probably 0 views)  4) Many viewers joining within a short timeframe (possible even the same minute/second).  That's something you could track on your dashboard when you think you got viewbottet the other day. Not sure if bots are implemented in a way that they try to hide their usage... if they did you can't apply 4). The bot would probably add a random delay to each client before joining a certain channel, to hide the pattern of ""create twitch account -> join stream""  That's the stuff that comes to my mind right now... probably there are way more indicators from which you could guess. But in the end, since you don't have the possibility to make any real time measures, you are left with making a GUESS and if you think someone abuses bots, report the stream to twitch."

Twitch,3d0piv,Sponge5,0,Sun Jul 12 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"Some streamers use stream tip, but I’m not sure if you still pay through paypal or not"
Twitch,3d0piv,I_like_cocaine,3,Sun Jul 12 19:03:51 2015 UTC,"You will still use PayPal. Streamtips and things like that are just ""Front End"" sites."
Twitch,3d0piv,joocrazymang,0,Sun Jul 12 19:19:01 2015 UTC,BTC would be cool if the market didn't crash every other week
Twitch,3d0piv,shavitush,2,Sun Jul 12 20:29:04 2015 UTC,"I thought this was the case too but recently had someone try to take back a $250 tip. I was told it was ""under investigation"" and I could end it by ""sending him goods"" but I e-mailed them back and they saw it was bullshit and denied his chargeback request. I honestly was surprised they helped me."
Twitch,3d0piv,DamnNoHtml,3,Sun Jul 12 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"To be clear, this ONLY works when they claim you didn't ship them anything. If they say ""unauthorized purchase"" its pretty much 50/50"
Twitch,3d0piv,iijeriichoii,6,Sun Jul 12 17:59:40 2015 UTC,I must have gotten lucky then
Twitch,3d0piv,DamnNoHtml,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:10:54 2015 UTC,"More like 0/100 from what I've heard. If it's unauthorized, the buyer will always win :/"
Twitch,3d0piv,KyleInHD,2,Mon Jul 13 03:06:49 2015 UTC,There is a picture directly above you proving otherwise.
Twitch,3d0piv,DamnNoHtml,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:40:43 2015 UTC,"Shh, don't interrupt the anti-PayPal circlejerk with facts.  They will take seller info on board, but they also have their own ways to tell if a transaction was unauthorized or not."
Twitch,3d0piv,Takseen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:52:20 2015 UTC,What is a good alternative service for accepting donations?
Twitch,3d0piv,l3ftsock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:13:35 2015 UTC,"There is none that I know of. PayPal is an intermediate company, so theoretically you could have your own service where people pay you via Square/Google Wallet and you handle everything. This puts you and ""your biz"" directly at risk for every dispute though."
Twitch,3d0piv,iijeriichoii,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:37:38 2015 UTC,"As of a couple days ago, Digital Goods are covered by paypal protection now IIRC (or is it a few days in the future?)"
Twitch,3d0piv,rallias,2,Sun Jul 12 23:03:31 2015 UTC,"Right, which is bad for us. It means that now the burden of proof is again on the streamer to prove that it wasn't fraudulent. This used to be the easy way out for chargebacks. Great in principle, bad for us as a group."
Twitch,3d0piv,iijeriichoii,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:12:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, at this point, you might have some better luck calling it a gratuity rather than a donation."
Twitch,3d0piv,rallias,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:17:05 2015 UTC,You kinda broke it to me :(
Twitch,3d0piv,Dr__House,2,Sun Jul 12 15:45:00 2015 UTC,You can email the charge back department directly and they will probably refund the fees given the situation. I ran a game that sells digital goods and I had this happen. I emailed them and explained what happened using the support site on PayPal and they refunded the fees.
Twitch,3d0piv,joocrazymang,11,Sun Jul 12 18:06:15 2015 UTC,I thought PayPal only charges a fee for chargebacks if you dispute the claim?
Twitch,3d0piv,MrLlamaSC,4,Sun Jul 12 16:18:06 2015 UTC,"This is what I thought as well, and from the looks of it   I lost all the cases and all the chargebacks went into his favour. And there is, where the problem starts.   Looks like they did try to dispute and lost. From my knowledge, if someone does a chargeback I just refund it immediately and don't try to dispute it at all. Saves me any fees. If this is wrong I'd be interested to know"
Twitch,3d0piv,skwert99,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:39:43 2015 UTC,What is the timeframe fire charge backs?  I suppose then it's best to not transfer the money out of PayPal until that time runs out.
Twitch,3d0piv,MrLlamaSC,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:02:59 2015 UTC,Honestly I run 3-6 months before they can no longer chargeback. It's a very long time
Twitch,3d0piv,MrLlamaSC,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:05:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I disputed the fact, that we accused me of robbery, cause he chargebacked transation, because he bought goods from me, which wasnt true. I dispute that fact. But I wrote there, that I have no problem with giving the money back. So what the hell."
Twitch,3d0piv,KyleInHD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:02:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah the dispute is what costs you though. I'm not sure what you can do here but I would keep calling. In the future don't worry about any reasoning, just don't dispute and you will be fine"
Twitch,3d0piv,Takseen,2,Sun Jul 12 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"Well I didnt know that :( But its good to know for the future, but I really hope, that in the future, I will never need to solve anything like this :("
Twitch,3d0piv,Dr__House,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:34:26 2015 UTC,So is the correct thing to do just sit back and do nothing when someone charges back? Because even by refunding I'm pretty sure that automatically opens a dispute case for review
Twitch,3d0piv,kitiaralol,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:09:09 2015 UTC,"In the case of a Twitch donation it seems pointless to dispute a chargeback, after all there's no actual good or service being provided, so there's no real loss to the streamer as such."
Twitch,3d0piv,Kanthes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:01:36 2015 UTC,Or if you ignore it and don't refund. They consider that a dispute.
Twitch,3d0piv,Dr__House,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:07:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, happened to me."
Twitch,3d0piv,Kanthes,6,Mon Jul 13 03:21:19 2015 UTC,"I've heard stories of streamers have put disclaimers in their donation pages or who's contacted Paypal over the phone to successfully challenge chargebacks, but by the sounds of it you've already tried that.  Unfortunately all I can say is that Twitch cannot assist you with this, as any tipping is done between you and the user with a 3rd party service; Not Twitch.  You may want to post on /r/legaladvice about whether or not a lawyer can help you, but do know that getting one could very well cost more than $500 if things end up going to court."
Twitch,3d0piv,gempir,10,Sun Jul 12 16:28:17 2015 UTC,"Since tipping has become such big business on twitch, you guys should be the middle men and provide an escrow for this at a small price. Protect your content creators or they'll head over to your competitors."
Twitch,3d0piv,Rybaka1994,8,Sun Jul 12 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I'm not the guy to tell this to (shoot feedback@twitch.tv an email!), but I do hope Twitch will implement something along those lines in the future!"
Twitch,3d0piv,gempir,8,Sun Jul 12 18:12:22 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping Twitch gets a donation service and they don't take likt 50% of it but only like a few percents.   Paypal is probably the only useful site right now for donating there are really no good alternatives.
Twitch,3d0piv,reddevil18,5,Sun Jul 12 19:47:23 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if twitch does its own thing and takes the 2 or 3% that paypal does it will be sweet."
Twitch,3d0piv,Dr__House,2,Sun Jul 12 20:21:38 2015 UTC,Yeah and then offer the same pay options like subbing.   If twitch handles chargebacks that would be great. And you could also know exactly who is writing the donation (twitch name)
Twitch,3d0piv,StrykerNoStriking,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:23:56 2015 UTC,So long as its not partners only :(
Twitch,3d0piv,redditcringearmy,4,Sun Jul 12 22:58:07 2015 UTC,I've fired off a detailed email explaining the idea. Thanks!
Twitch,3d0piv,carthroway,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"Considering that YouTube already has a system in place with Google Wallet, I'd be very surprised if something weren't in the works at Twitch somewhere... Maybe they're making secret deals with PayPal, just to make us all grind our teeth. After all, most streamers are already set up through PayPal, so authorizing/streamlining the service (no pun intended) makes sense from a corporate perspective--plus, it'd take YTG out at the knees, I bet."
Twitch,3d0piv,Dr__House,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:31:59 2015 UTC,"Now that Twitch is owned by Amazon, this is a great idea. Twitch could even keep the transaction fee if they wanted, and they would have the tools to assist streamers with chargebacks since they understand the process and could review the actual donations."
Twitch,3d0piv,Nyaliah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:21:29 2015 UTC,The problem there is that they'll have to start reporting your tips to the IRS ;)
Twitch,3d0piv,justmeandmyself10,4,Sun Jul 12 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"Only if you go over a certain amount (correct me if I'm wrong). Paypal also steps in if an account goes over a certain yearly amount, in order to collect information to report to the IRS so thats already a thing streamers have to deal with anyway."
Twitch,3d0piv,KyleInHD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:45:23 2015 UTC,Amazon Payments is already a thing... why not use that? It is more costly than paypal but oh well it is amazons own payment system. I could imagine integration of a wishlist from amazon too. So many options...
Twitch,3d0piv,GothamTeam,6,Mon Jul 13 07:08:05 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why a streamer wouldn't just refund someone's money in a case like this? Sure the person who donated is probably being a douche, or it could be an unauthorized charge and the person didn't know how best to dispute it.  But 15 dollars per charge back on PayPal's part is still pretty steep."
Twitch,3d0piv,poleo222,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:11:29 2015 UTC,"In my experience, you don't get the option to refund. The funds are sucked from your account, dispute case is opened, and seller loses. Then you're hit with fees. Even by disputing, you'll lose an unauthorized chargeback case no matter what"
Twitch,3d0piv,distortednet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:11:07 2015 UTC,"Paypal deal with people like that? Meh paypal, meh."
Twitch,3d0piv,ZeusAllMighty11,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:25:49 2015 UTC,Why is paypal to stupid :(
Twitch,3d0piv,distortednet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:29:26 2015 UTC,paypal can take up to 90 days to reverse a chargeback if i recall.
Twitch,3d0piv,AnEternalEnigma,0,Sun Jul 12 15:37:02 2015 UTC,Even after the cases are closed? Because they are already decided to his favor
Twitch,3d0piv,Takseen,2,Sun Jul 12 15:38:31 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that 'case closed' is truly case closed. I've had to deal with chargebacks too, not Twitch-related, but in a similar fashion. I never lost a case, though I would've if I hadn't called as a very frustrated customer. In addition, I threatened further legal action if it was necessary, and I ended up being transfered from a PayPal rep to someone higher up (I don't remember their position) and the problem was solved within a few hours, in my favor.  However, you can take further legal action if you really think the cost of all the legal fees is worth the amount of money you lost. I know it sucks and it's total bullshit, people are assholes."
Twitch,3d0piv,poepz0r,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:25:50 2015 UTC,"yikes, in that case there isn't anything you can do as far as i am aware"
Twitch,3d0piv,FanaticDreamer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"This shit sucks so bad. If I ever get a tip/donation over $50, I just let it sit there for three months before touching it unless I know the person who did it pretty well. I recently got a $46 tip, but I knew who did it and knew they won't chargeback."
Twitch,3d0piv,Belhifeto,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:16:29 2015 UTC,"There's two kinds of chargebacks people can file. Item not received/not as described. This obviously wouldn't work with Twitch donations, because there's no service being provided(realistically).  Or they could file a chargeback for an unauthorized charge.   This could be a genuine case of one of your stream viewers donating you money using a card they know to be stolen, and then the real owner does a chargeback when he sees some wtf charges on his statement a month later.  Or it could be some prick who donates a bunch of money to you for a laugh, then fraudently tells his card issuer that the charges weren't authorized. Though to be honest, I can't imagine this would be very common. A serial abuser of this would have a very hard time making any online purchases, and if you are going to commit chargeback fraud, it'd make more sense to buy an actual product or service with it."
Twitch,3d0piv,DehiXeM,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:53:15 2015 UTC,"What i dont understand is that a chargeback is possible but when people sub to you through PayPal a chargeback is not possible if im correct, whats the difference paypal and 3th party services? hy cant Streamtip etc not making something that a chargeback is not possible, even for 1% extra fee or something."
Twitch,3d0piv,Jhny_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"For future reference, put somewhere on stream a disclaimer that donation is optional but when you press the donate button you're consenting that you own the funds and waive any right to a chargeback.   If you have that, you can send Paypal proof of that and it should help your case. I know quite a few streamers who do it."
Twitch,3d0piv,unph4zed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:47:25 2015 UTC,"Don't dispute the chargeback, refund the money --- no charge back fee."

Twitch,3d0piv,twist_s,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of young viewers on Twitch that get a hold of their parents credit card and go on donation sprees. This is something that you, as a streamer, must plan for. Do not touch the money for at least 6 months or at the very least be prepared to lose any of the money that was donated. I would not dispute any small charges. Dispute the large ones only if you have plenty of proof and are prepared to pay the fee for doing so."
Twitch,3d0piv,majorstevens,2,Sun Jul 12 15:39:54 2015 UTC,"Looking forward to your return, sir!"
Twitch,3d0piv,OruTaki,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:46:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like you are trolling me, or you didnt read my statement at all. I said, that I have no problem with giving donation back. I dont care if he gets the money back and you wrote, that the money should sit on accout....THEY DID! The money were on account, just sitting.   And I dont care of giving the money back. Only thing that I dont want to do, is pay fees, that are twice bigger as money donated itself."
Twitch,3d0piv,Ehrq,3,Sun Jul 12 21:25:03 2015 UTC,"I did read it. I responded in a way that should help others, not just yourself. I would suggest, like others already have, that you contact PayPal and explain the multiple fraudulent donations. They have reversed these fees in the past.    In the future I suggest you read through the fine print before you start accepting money from people. PayPal clearly states how it handles charge backs. You aren't selling a tangible item so you are very likely to lose these types of cases. I hope you at least setup a business PayPal account so people are unable to get your personal details.    Here is a good post explaining why a business account is way better for accepting donations.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/34b375/follow_up_how_i_avoided_a_paypal_nightmare_1500/cqt9d35"

Twitch,3d61ps,pillowman205,6,Mon Jul 13 20:21:26 2015 UTC,"I'd love to say no, but maybe I'm sitting at a laptop in a library because I lost my house and my dogs, taking a break between applying for jobs and obsessing over my now-ex-fiance's Facebook page, where he's replaced me with a more athletic model, and I'm not sure if I remembered to grab blankets as I dashed out of my former home so I can sleep in the car. I probably haven't slept for 36 hours from stress, anger, and despair.  In that case, I'd take the $200--if it were guaranteed that I could collect.   Thankfully and in reality, I'm in the financial position where I can take the moral high road. So no, I wouldn't at this moment in time.

Twitch,3d61ps,StrykerNoStriking,3,Tue Jul 14 09:57:09 2015 UTC,"Harassing someone else is against the Terms of Service. I guarantee you they're not going to pay. They're just a troll trying to get you to break the rules. Or they want you to do something dumb, so they can record it and make fun of you on YouTube. They'll want you to put shoes on your head, delete the 'Windows System32 Folder' or other such nonsense. Go to YouTube and search ""Twitch Trolls"" and watch how these guys get a comfortable viewership, by laughing at people like you, because you struggle along with 5 viewers and are 'dumb' enough to fall for their tricks. They win, you loose. Don't be that guy. Worst case scenario is they'll have video proof of you breaking rules."

Twitch,3d61ps,riseyyy,2,Mon Jul 13 22:54:53 2015 UTC,Of course not! Nobody should do this and I would have banned that user who offered the money on the spot. You made the right decision to not take the offer - harassment is against the rules of Twitch.
Twitch,3d61ps,Heep123,0,Mon Jul 13 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"Just curious, but is there a difference between harassment, and trolling?"
Twitch,3d61ps,compugasm,2,Mon Jul 13 20:31:39 2015 UTC,"Harassment starts as soon as you tell someone to stop doing whatever it is they're doing. If you ban someone, that is the warning. You don't even have to give a warning first. So if this troll creates fake accounts, or whatever, so they can continue doing whatever it was that lead to the ban... that's harassment. You should report this user to Twitch. They have a special drop down box for this."
Twitch,3d61ps,Heep123,4,Mon Jul 13 21:35:18 2015 UTC,It depends on the type of trolling. I see this type of it as harassment.

Twitch,3d4688,DanishTechhead,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:03:22 2015 UTC,"This is the best I can do personally  The cpu will be good for rendering with the extra 2 cores and the gpu will play most new games on medium-high in a usable framerate for streaming. More ram and proper cooling for the cpu might be a priority down the road but to begin with the included stock cpu cooler will be fine. And I have only 8gb ram myself and have no problems, so you might want to upgrade cooling first.  This build is without an OS though, but you can pick that up for cheap on r/microsoftsoftwareswap   If you post the link to the build on /builapc you might be able to get som more suggestions so you can perfect the build, as this is only one guys knowledge :) good luck with the stream! :)"

Twitch,3d4688,DanishTechhead,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:41:53 2015 UTC,"Fair enough :) you could always put in a gpu later :) AMD CPUs er generally good for the money, I have never used one myself as I have never built a budget pc for my own use, but people who have them usually love them. If you can get a high end i5 or i7 now that the gpu is gone, you should totally go for it though :) just keep in mind that you will need a new mb since amd and intel use different  CPU sockets :)"

Twitch,3d3vpl,distortednet,2,Mon Jul 13 09:34:05 2015 UTC,Solid answer. Also keep in mind not every speedrunner uses gold splits (Zfg1 a popular OOT speedrunner used blue splits for his best segments if I remember correctly)
Twitch,3d3vpl,Growlibi,2,Mon Jul 13 10:17:15 2015 UTC,By default gold means that you basically got a personal best on that specific split. It doesn't have to be gold though you can change it . mine are rainbow colored.
Twitch,3d3cwu,itswade,3,Mon Jul 13 04:53:52 2015 UTC,"I use a 4690k for streaming cs:go at 720p/60 fps and 3k bitrate. I have no problem. I assume you only get the lag when streaming, but clarify if this is wrong.  There's a couple things you could try.   Method 1: Try streaming a different(but similar genre) game with the same settings as what you use for cs:go when you experience lag. Method 2: Try streaming a different, less intensive game like hearthstone or LoL with the same settings.   In my opinion, you may want to invest in a new GPU at some point. I'm not entirely sure what impacts a GPU has on streaming, but I'm sure you'll want to replace your 760 sometime soon.  Good luck!"

Twitch,3d3cwu,Ghetto-Banana,2,Tue Jul 14 06:36:01 2015 UTC,"Have you tried something other than OBS? Maybe xsplit? Just to rule that out.  Also on OBS, what kind of capture are you using? Game, window, monitor?  Does it happen when you are previewing the stream?  What's your usual frame rate when not streaming?"
Twitch,3d3cwu,Ghetto-Banana,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:52:30 2015 UTC,Haven't tried xsplit.  Might give that a go.  I'm using game capture when I'm ingame and monitor when I'm on my desktop.  Preview and actual streaming cause the game to feel the same way.  Screen tearing and a low hz feel.
Twitch,3d3cwu,ForwardGaming,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, in OBS try changing your x264 setting to super fast, or ultrafast and let me know if that's any better?"
Twitch,3d3cwu,d2_ricci,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:44:13 2015 UTC,It's a little bit better. I'm trying to figure out what the issue is as a whole without effecting stream quality because I see people with an inferior cpu streaming at 720p/60fps with veryfast default with zero in game issues.  That's kind of what I'm trying to get to.  Thanks for your help
Twitch,3d3cwu,hubsmash,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:55:03 2015 UTC,"Ahh I understand. Sorry about these lists of questions.  Are you using 64bit OBS (If your PC supports it) Running it as Administrator? (right click run as admin) What mode is CSGO in, windowed, fullscreen, fullscreen windowed?    And yeah, don't worry :)"
Twitch,3d3cwu,hubsmash,2,Mon Jul 13 19:15:31 2015 UTC,The graphics card takes the load of the game and xsplit or obs. With a better card your frame rate could be enhanced greatly due to xsplit/obs not taking up your resources to display what you are streaming. You say that your in game is laggy? Have your tried minimizing your streaming program while you play/stream? You could have an issue with your drivers or even with the priority settings.  The issues could be endless. I wish I was there to help.
Twitch,3d3cwu,riseyyy,2,Mon Jul 13 13:27:30 2015 UTC,"First, check your launch options.  If you have  -high or -threads 8 in there, remove them and see if you can game without them (you probably can).  both CS:GO and OBS take up use of multithreading so the they are probably directly fighting eachother for CPU time.  Second,  if your game is running at low res (1024x768 or 1280x720)  then your game will use up much more CPU than GPU.  this is a fact with almost all games.   You might be making your game use up more CPU than it needs to, and since OBS is using that as well, there in lies your issue.    Maybe consider raising your in-game resolution (or even using AA)   OR   Using a hardware encoder like NVENC or VCE, which will put the stream load back on your GPU effectivly balancing out your computer-load."
Twitch,3d3cwu,butterkipz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:43:24 2015 UTC,no -high or -threads.  I do play at low res but when I'm ingame and streaming I'm only seeing about 45% usage so maybe it's not that?
Twitch,3d1wsd,redditcringearmy,21,Sun Jul 12 21:22:41 2015 UTC,"You are probably referring to my charity stream.  I agree, it is shady but it was the best way to do it. Almost all charities I have done have gone through my paypal account. Many broadcasters in the past used to use chipin to set a goal while having it pay out to their paypal and then sending the money raised to the charity but that doesn't really solve the problem.  When I was setting up my charity event I could have gone directly through Doctors Without Borders fundraiser or through gofundme or justgiving. The problem with all three sites is that the only way to donate is to manually put in your credit card information. It was ridiculous. I did also email Doctors Without Borders about a custom paypal link but they never responded to me so that didn't help.   I put myself in the viewers perspective and wanted to make it as easy as possible to donate. Every path just lead back to me using my current donation setup, having a goal on twitchalerts, and then donating the money raised to charity.  The pros were that I was able to associate everything charity related with my current overlay with notifications as well as information about the top donation.   I'd go out on a whim and easily say that if it wasn't for paypal support I would have not raised near $43,000.   About the tax write off, that didn't cross my mind at all nor was it a reason to go through my personal paypal but now that I think about it, you are right... I could do that.    typed on phone, sorry for typos"
Twitch,3d1wsd,Lirikk,2,Mon Jul 13 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was referring to it. However after I made the post and another person commented on it, I realized that one of the main draws to get people to donate - the stream notification - would not be possible if the donations were made directly. Without that, and just trying to rely on your viewers to donate directly without the ""reward"" of reading their donation message, I don't think you would have raised nearly as much. I might be wrong on that, but I think the donation interaction with the streamer is critical to driving donations and subscriptions on Twitch. That's why it would be nice if Twitch offered an official avenue for this and some integration through the site.   Although your stream was the impetus for thinking about this, I hope it didn't come across as if I was implying your charity drive was shady or was indicative of some of the other comments I made. I know you hate 24 hour streams so that was a pretty big deal. And as someone whose father is currently in Doctors Without Borders, I really appreciate it."
Twitch,3d1wsd,wolfej4,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:45:06 2015 UTC,"It does seem a bit shady, but with myself trying to do charity streams, collecting money with PayPal and then sending it off to a charity seems too be the easiest and most logical way of doing so.  When you stream for charity, do you contact who you are raising for and inform them or do you just set up a stream and donate on a whim?"

Twitch,3d1wsd,SlammingAtom,2,Mon Jul 13 11:24:16 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it, Lirik will actually need to declare the 45k as income (since Paypal will report it as such to the IRS). When he then makes the donation, that income will be subtracted, which basically makes the whole thing a wash as far as obtaining a tax benefit from it. I never really considered that."
Twitch,3d1wsd,HammerIsMyName,4,Mon Jul 13 22:47:47 2015 UTC,"I used to do this for my stream. It really seemed the best way to set it up, for the purposes of stream alerts. I actually even asked here if there was a way to do it without being able to have access to the money myself, but no one seemed to have any idea.  I wound up raising a couple hundred bucks for Childs play last year. The thought of keeping it had never crossed my mind, but I guess it could have. I was open and honest about how I was doing it, and told everyone if they had any doubt whatsoever that they shouldn't donate.   After I donated the money, I tweeted the confirmation number and sent a message to everyone who donated with the number they gave.  While it wouldn't be feasible for someone of Lirikks size to do that, I'd like to think that at a certain size, people will stay honest. People who are going to keep the money or try to do something shady with it would probably get called out or caught way earlier in the game."
Twitch,3d1wsd,imwaltermcd,7,Mon Jul 13 11:12:16 2015 UTC,There should be a requirement that all charity events/streams should have direct donation setups so the streamer is not the one handling the money. There is zero reason why the streamer should ever hold the funds - Not the forget that receiving and transferring funds on PayPal has a transaction fee attached to it.  I highly recommend that people never donate to charities through third parties. Do it directly. There's no reason for it to go through a streamer.
Twitch,3d1wsd,djsupersoak,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"Those are some great points and I didn't even think about the Paypal transaction fee aspect of it. So the charity then gets less money as well. What is the transaction fee, 2%? That would be an additional $900 in this case. Although I'm sure this streamer will donate the entire amount when he makes the donation, but after reading your points, I'm starting to side more with the idea that the streamer shouldn't touch the money. I would assume most larger charities have some type of group donation page you can set up.  The only downside to this that I can think of, is that I'm guessing you can't set up tnotifier to let you know when someone donates directly to the charity, so you would lose a lot of donations from the people who donate mostly to see their donation message on screen. That's why a setup through Twitch would be good."
Twitch,3d1wsd,StrangerSin,2,Sun Jul 12 22:12:51 2015 UTC,"When I have watched and been a part of a charity stream, the streamer doing it has always done the donation to said charity on stream for everyone to see and provided verification emails.   It all comes down to trust. I don't see one of the best know streamers such as lirukk or trick2g compromising their twitch status and name to make some extra money. Think about all the future money they would lose out on.   But I agree, there should be some stance on this from twitch.   I will be starting a stream soon (moving and going to have good enough internet finally) and part of my plan is have a % of ALL donation goto a different charity each month."
Twitch,3d1wsd,matthewdubya,3,Mon Jul 13 16:34:56 2015 UTC,I run a charity stream and we only work with charities that allow us to create direct donation links to track our donations. I wouldn't recommend doing it any other way.  Child's Play is fantastic for this.

Twitch,3d1wsd,Dcat682,-1,Sun Jul 12 23:59:58 2015 UTC,"Because your question is long I just want to make sure I understand it before answering.  Your question is, ""Is there a way to donate directly to the charity instead of to the streamer? Can we donate to twitch and then twitch to the charity?""    There is a slight flaw in your logic if I have read your question properly.  If streamers have the ability to make off with the money why can't twitch just make off with the money.  If you aren't comfortable donating to the streamer, why don't you donate directly to the charity and skip the middle man?  Any streamer worth his merits would have two different donation links to donate to a charity. 1) A link to the streamer's paypal - this is going through the streamer but it allows him/her to keep a running total of all the money donated to the stream. 2) A link to the charity's main website.  This website will have a donation link that goes directly to the charity itself.  If you aren't comfortable donating to link 1 then donate to link 2.  Please Note: I only used link 1 and link 2 as an example.  I have no clue which links will take you where and sometimes streamers only have the donation straight into their paypal.  Be careful before donating and donate in whatever way you are most comfortable if you intend to donate."

Twitch,3d11m2,GroundTar,4,Sun Jul 12 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"""Breaking rules"" isn't really an issue anymore as Twitch has introduced multiple categories these kind's of streams can now fall under."
Twitch,3d11m2,PensiveLionTurtle,-3,Mon Jul 13 00:40:47 2015 UTC,"Abusing drugs on stream, showing bare tits multiple times, showing people ""grinding"" and ""twerking"".  All those are against the rules and have nothing to do with music other than the fucking morons who listen to that garbage."
Twitch,3d11m2,WhimsicalPythons,2,Mon Jul 13 01:57:58 2015 UTC,"Grinding and Twerking? Sure, maybe, although that isn't typically the dances associated with this style of music.  Abusing drugs on stream and tits? Since I started watching about halfway through so I suppose I can't deny that with 100% certainty  but I'd challenge you to find those on the VOD where it actually hit the screens.  Much like other broadcasted concerts, there's a production crew and people organizing the cameras to not pan to those specific types of things."
Twitch,3d34ju,SamClose1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:36:07 2015 UTC,"If you play low-motions games where large amounts of the screen remain static require considerably lower bitrates compared to high-motion games (CS:GO, etc). So streaming low-motion games at 720p @ 30fps will require bitrate of around 1700, for high-motions games you should be able to get 720p @ 30fps for 2500. This is presuming that you are using some sort of capture device and broadcasting software. Hope it helps a little."

Twitch,3d10zi,Phalconer,3,Sun Jul 12 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"My understanding of this issue is that you are only allowed to stream three different kinds of music.   Music you personally have created from scratch. Music you have obtained the proper license for from the copyright holders. Music from the approved list on the Twitch.tv web site.   Playing music from anywhere else is not allowed. There is a list of Spotify playlists that includes (I think) only approved music that Twitch has posted are acceptable to be streamed.   Also, the majority of commentary I saw while looking for a guide mentioned that music playing on streams is pretty annoying since people can play their own music in the background on their computer, but they can't mute the music alone on the stream if it's not their type."
Twitch,3d10zi,Stripes88,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:09:50 2015 UTC,"but what about the whole nightbot playlist thing?? Ive seen plenty of people do song requests without having to obtain licenses from anything, that part has always confused me"
Twitch,3d10zi,Tron_JavoIta,3,Sun Jul 12 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"Simple: it's against the rules to play music protected by copyright. What music does that entail? Basically all of it. If it's been commercially released then it's got a copyright, essentially. (And before some numbskull comes in to split hairs: Commercially released music is music released with the intent to make profit or bolster sales. Even if no one buys it because it is awful, it's about the attempt to make money, not how successful it is at making money.)     Nightbot doesn't differentiate between it so you're taking the risk your self over it.    The worst I have seen in a long time is the replays get muted. Has twitch or others gone further than that to prosecute people violating copyright? I personally haven't seen or heard of it, no. But does that  mean it can't happen? Also, no.    Currently, the system is rather rigid to those outcomes, but if someone gets an itch to start busting people over it, well, they can.    In summation, I officially advise against but hey, it's your choice. Trust me when I say that if heads do start rolling over it, I'd bet a bottle of the finest Kentucky Bourbon that twitch will sell out anyone guilty of it without a second thought and no amount of crying or screaming will save them. Currently, the coast seems clear, or they would have sold out violators en made by now.    And now you know, and knowing is half the battle...    Cheers."

It doesn't have integrated graphics so you'll need to get a gpu, which you plan to do anyhow. I can't say too much about the the minimum requirements of the gpu needed for streaming but coincidently enough I'll be building a dedicated streaming PC with my Xeon and I'll be picking up an evga 750ti SC, its about $100-120.   It all depends on what cpu preset you want to use in OBS and what your budget for the processor is. People say that the cost to utilize the slower x264 presets doesn't justify the quality difference between medium and slowest.   What's in your encoding rig now and what presets are you using in OBS?"

If not then just get whatever doesn't break the bank it's not going to impact to quality of your stream at all."
Twitch,3d278p,LtRoyalShrimp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:32:27 2015 UTC,Cool. I'll be going with a 4790k. I'm really trying to decide on a gpu for this. I was thinking a GT 730 as a few people mentioned. Royal suggested a minimum of GTX 650 so I'm a little on the fence with a gpu still.
Twitch,3d278p,LtRoyalShrimp,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:31:50 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/ANIMATE1016,  Here are the recommended specifications for a PC that is gaming/streaming or simply a streaming PC, or if you simply want to upgrade a part.   Each section will go a little bit into detail about why each component is important.     CPU:  You will want to go with the best CPU you can. Ideally that is where most of your PC build budget is spent. Due to how streaming works, the CPU is the most important part.   General recommendations for CPU's:    Any of the following or newer Intel Core i7 CPU's, with better ones in descending order.  Core i7 2600k Core i7 3770k Core i7 4770k Core i7 4790k Core i7 5820k Core i7 5930k Core i7 5960x   AMD CPU's are not recommended for streaming as they have very low IPC(Instructions-per-clock) performance. A top-of-the-line AMD 8350 CPU will perform as well or maybe worse as a i7 2600k, a 4 year old Intel CPU.     Ram:  Ram is not very important when streaming. Typically, when using a program like OBS, no more than 500MB will be used. Of course, this may very depending on the amount of source, plugins etc.   General recommendation for ram:    8GB DDR3 or higher     GPU: The GPU is the next most essential part of streaming. Popular programs like OBS, Xsplit and others perform actions on the GPU, like compositing, which is when the game video, webcam video, overlays, etc are all mixed into one picture, and scaling, which when your stream is converted from 1080p to 720p. Other actions include anti-alising, which can be applied after scaling to increase the quality, and other effects.   General recommendation for GPU:    Nvidia - Any GTX 650 series or higher (700, 900)  AMD - Any Radeon 6850 series or higher (7000, R7, R9)     Thats pretty much it. Other parts like the case, power supply, and hard drive is up to you, as they do not make a huge difference. If you will be doing lots of recordings and/or recording your streams, a 2TB or 4TB HDD would be beneficial to your build.   Cheers,  -Royal"

Twitch,3d23de,crakyLPs,2,Sun Jul 12 22:16:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's not bad for not even 3 weeks of streaming. Getting started is always the hardest part, and if you can get someone who keeps coming back, you're already doing better than most. Your game selection seems to be alright, since you've picked games that aren't necessarily oversaturated, yet appropriate given the current climate (Arkham Knight is still the latest big release, people are hyped for Fallout, etc.). You just have to keep going!  I took a quick look at your channel, just to check if there was anything you were missing/doing ""wrong"" that could be easily corrected. Your channel appearance, first off, looks great! The panels match, you have a good-looking offline slate, etc. The stream itself seemed alright, and you've got commentary, which is better than the lack thereof from plenty of other new guys. Two quick recommendations:  1) Let the stream run a bit before doing your welcome. The VoD I watched of one of your Batman streams started with you mid-sentence, which means you started speaking as soon as you hit the broadcast button. A ton of streamers like to run a small intro, with either a simple slide saying stream will start soon, or a countdown, both accompanied by music. That way, you know you aren't letting of that content slip.  2) I know this is going to sound harsh, but get rid of the donation bar on top. It's pretty low res, takes up too much of the screen, and (unfortunately) will be useless for your first 1-2 months of streaming (if not longer). By being someone new with very few viewers, it gives the impression that you're only jumping into this to make money off of your broadcasts, and even if that's not true, it can be enough to drive people away. Let your donation panel do the selling for it for now, and set up drop-in alerts that only appear if someone donates. At worst, if you absolutely demand that to be up (against my, and I'm sure many others here's judgement), at least put some of your own money into it to get that counter off of $0."

Twitch,3d1qc3,NeXoSp33d,2,Sun Jul 12 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, a partnership. Right now it is very difficult to stream @60 FPS and have viewers who are able to view your stream. The vast majority of your viewers will run into buffering issues if you try to turn the dial up to maximum immediately.   Partnership increases the bitrate Twitch will let you stream and offers you transcoding (quality options) so 60FPS is more viable then.  In the meantime, the ""golden ratio"" of accessibility to quality is the following settings:  Resolution: 1280x720p (Downscale within OBS if needed)  Frame Rate: 30fps  Bitrate: 2000kbps"
Twitch,3d1qc3,Marstead,2,Sun Jul 12 20:57:50 2015 UTC,I saw a partnered steamer today that was running a dual computer setup (not sure how that works)  and was pulling off what appeared to be higher framerate than anyone I had seen before on Arma 3. I'd love to be able to put out a good quality image for viewers.
Twitch,3d1qc3,Marstead,2,Sun Jul 12 21:07:15 2015 UTC,"It's not really whether your computer is able to handle a 60FPS stream (I'm sure it can!) it's whether the majority of viewers on Twitch are able to see it. Until you get a partnership you don't have transcoding options, so buffering viewers aren't able to tone down the stream quality to be able to watch you. You can try streaming at a high quality like this and I'm sure it will look great, but if you want strangers to be able to stumble in and watch you're going to lose ~50%+ viewers to buffering issues. (Buffering is already an issue for many rural viewers at the 720p/30fps/2000 kbps ""golden"" ratio).  Viewers having buffering issues with your stream will be a problem regardless of how you set it up on your end -- dual computer or not. If their internet quality isn't very high they won't be able to watch, and if you're just starting out you won't be able to tell as they will just pop in, see it's buffering, and leave without talking to you.  EDIT: Alternatively, YouTube does provide transcoding to everyone immediately. You could try dual-streaming to both YouTube & Twitch via restream.io; and then put some kind of note in your overlay pointing buffering viewers to try watching on YouTube if they're having issues. If you really, really want to stream at 60FPS."
Twitch,3d1qc3,Marstead,2,Sun Jul 12 21:13:18 2015 UTC,That's kind of Shitty that you can't let them choose quality until you have a partnership..  I'll probably have to look into that streaming to YouTube option as well.  What reason to people use dual computers / capture cards.  Would either of these new relevant until I get a partnership or good options to have in mind?
Twitch,3d1qc3,Gamefan211,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:23:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Apparently, transcoding (viewers being able to set quality) is extremely expensive technology. Counter-intuitively expensive. As in, Twitch decided it still wouldn't be worth it for them if they offered transcoding to Turbo subscribers, so it clearly costs them more than $20/month/streamer. YouTube can offer it for free just because Google has more capital to throw around. There's some hope competition from YT Gaming will push Twitch to do the same thing, but we'll see.  Dual Computers do make sense depending on what you're playing. You're basically off-loading the CPU cost of encoding and loading your stream to a second machine. For a lot of games this can be excessive; you'd really only need to look into this if your gaming computer sees frame rate drops when you start streaming. I play some very recent, demanding games at the ""golden ratio"" and haven't ever had a frame rate drop when streaming."

Twitch,3d1qc3,Mugros,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:09:47 2015 UTC,"Twitch only guarantees transcoding to partnered streamers. However they have enough resources to support some # of channels. If they have extra resources (i.e. not all partners are streaming) they will dynamically give transcodimg to nonpartners in order or concurrent viewers.

You don't need anything really amazing to pull off 1080p 60fps. I always live stream to YouTube at that rate. Twitch of course handicaps users who aren't partnered.

I have run bitrates from 2200-3500 and while nobody has complained to me about seeing my stream buffer at 3500 I'd highly suggest going somewhere between 2200-2700.   One question I do have though. Does it make any sense that I think a lower bitrate at 60 FPS looks smoother than a higher bitrate at 60 FPS?

What you are looking for is a unique attention grabber that is easy to spell without any guidance. Many other streamers, including myself, solve this problem with a phrase. Some examples I can think of are: ThatGuyLirik and Itmejp. These are Simple and sweet. So maybe you could try something like ""ItsMistaJay"" (Also a fun batman reference).  If that's not your mojo then two words put together like MistaTechno.  Or maybe Mistafied  or maybe don't listen to me because I'm bad at coming up with names :P"

Twitch,3d2tvy,Mugros,2,Sun Jul 19 21:14:26 2015 UTC,"Like what everyone said, try and fiddle around with it to get something that's open on as many platforms as possible. Personally I scrapped all my old common usernames for security reasons (new name means less history to try and dox).  Core things to try and achieve with a username - it should be simple! Using the name ""01189998819991197253"" despite being an amazing reference is hard for most people to remember and harder for people who vaguely remember you to look you up later.   The second is memorable. Make it interesting, funny, or somehow catchy. My handle (ErinMyLungs) is a fun pun that all together is a nifty phrase. Another example is a streamer's name DolphinChemist (note - I'm just a follower of his! no shills here ;P). It's goofy, unique, and very memorable!  The third is having it easily shortened. This is more important if your handle is longer or a phrase. Mine is easily shortened to Erin, DolphinChemist goes by DC, and you mention keeping Mista.  So look for stuff that's simple, memorable, and easy to say or can be shortened to a nickname.   What type of streaming are you doing? Building computers or programming? Gaming? Maybe incorporate some aspect of what you plan on streaming about. Be careful not to make your name TOO specific so it's not like MistaPokemon in case you decide to switch to digimon and everyone keeps asking why you aren't playing pokemon.  Maybe something like MistaGHz? Or MistaHertz! Mista-HaveYouTriedTurningItOffAndOnAgain? :P  Play around with it, brainstorm ideas! And maybe draft up usernames that don't use mista. You might think of something that's worth changing your nickname. Good luck!"

We aim to have the best quality emotes that we can. In order to achieve this goal, we have created a set of rules that emotes must abide by. The rules for every submission are stated on the right side of the upload page, if you have not read them yet.  We require transparency for much of the emotes submitted, unless the background is clearly intentional. If it's clear to us that the emote you submitted doesn't need a background, or if it's black or white solid colors, it will be rejected.   How can I get a gif like SourPls if it has to have a transparent background?   SourPls has been an emote for a couple years, so special provisions are in play for it. Any other GIFs that have been uploaded since already conform to the new rules."

Twitch,3d147f,Dancingg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I have an AMD FX-6100 Six-Core Processor @ 3.30 GHz and an AMD Radeon R9 280 card.

When I stream Payday 2 can drop to like 40ish FPS but I don't think my hardware is the issue. The stream goes offline, I don't think OBS itself freezes/crashes, it just won't let me move the mouse or use any keys."
Twitch,3d147f,Dancingg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:37:48 2015 UTC,"Your CPU is a little on the mid-lower end. Streaming takes a fairly large chunk of CPU power to utilize, not to mention the actual game and any other extra programs you have running.   Do you get frame drops while playing games and NOT streaming?  As for the Mouse/Keyboard. Could be some bad USB ports. Try utilizing other ones if you can. Also if they're in 3.0 ports, maybe try 2.0. If this kind of problem happens off OBS, it could be bad ports or a motherboard issue.  Lastly, if you're trying to stream on a wireless connection, try switching to a wired one. Wireless connections can be a bit finnicky, especially with how much data is being transferred while streaming. Massive frame drops can result in OBS just shutting the stream off. You mention you don't think it's a hardware issue. Try lowering the bitrate or downscaling the resolution.  Posting pics of your encoding, video, and advanced settings would help too but you might get better help just posting on the official OBS forums. They'll likely ask for a log and would likely be more helpful than me haha."

If you want to show multiple consoles at once, you'll need a capture card for each one. However, if you want to only show one console at once, you might be able to use an HDMI splitter off each console. Then you can run one cable to the TV the participant would be using, and the other into another HDMI switch which would allow you to select an input to view that player's console.  The downside to only using the one capture card is the delay it would take to aquire the signal when switching and any additional lag the splitter might induce (mostly for the stream, not the player)"
Twitch,3d0g8p,MatheusDebull,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:52:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for replying.  Lag on the stream wouldn't really be a problem so using HDMI splitters and a switch could work.   However it is more than likely we can get access to multiple capture cards as one of the participants dads owns a tech store. Would we need multiple computers or is it possible to run 4 capture cards into one computer?
Twitch,3d0g8p,MatheusDebull,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:02:09 2015 UTC,"That depends on the computer used and the capture cards used.  If using internal capture cards, you'd be limited to the amount of lanes allowed by the cpu. If you're using External capture cards via usb 3.0 might not be an issue"
Twitch,3d0wbn,JackOreoTV,7,Sun Jul 12 16:20:13 2015 UTC,"Here is my opinion:     I wouldn't watch/follow a streamer where there is a quite large banner constantly on the screen. Sure, other streamers have banners, but I'd say that are normally smaller and have less blaring colours. The banners also don't offer anything of value for the viewer. I know that I'm on Twitch and I watch your channel, no need to tell me on the banner. If there is a banner, I can tolerate last subscriber, sub goals, donations, but not static channel ads. The banner on the VODs I checked also makes it look like you are a Minecraft streamer. This might put people off. Don't limit yourself. Your name might cause problems in the future. Don't use brand or products names.   Most important:    I'm just now watching you live stream and it is a constant slide show. The quality is awful. Bitrate is too low. Constantly dropped frames.

Maybe you can get away with old games that don't have high resolutions and little detail or very static games. But always remember that there are possibly other streamers that are in the same position as you but have more upload and so can provide a better stream quality. If I follow/watch a streamer then only if the quality is spot.  If your PC can handle more encoding, use a slower preset for x264. It will make the stream look better with the same amount of bitrate.  But if you really want to get into streaming, you need to look into getter faster upload speed."

Yes through your IP a lot of information can be found. First off your ISP can be found and through some programs your address even. Once they have your home address they can easily obtain your name as a resident of that house. With your name they can now look you up and find your phone number. The thing here is really think if this ""troll"" we will label him, will do anything. He is probably nothing more than some man-child with no obligations or friends. If you're that shaken up or scared for your life then contact the authorities. Sadly this guy probably used some internet phone service to call you and the police don't take the time to track all that information down. I'm a staff member of a quite hated gaming community and as such get DOX'ed all the time (That is the term for the collection of information with malicious intent or to be released online).

Twitch,3cyb3g,Daylen,7,Sat Jul 11 22:05:41 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that it is literally impossible to get a home address through an IP even if IP is at all found and used. There's no public data on street addresses and even tracert doesn't go further than your nearest ISP substation. Calling ISP would be the only option but they generally don't disclose address information.  The only way to get a number is through publicly available info like Facebook with default privacy settings.

Twitch,3cyb3g,TheMissingLink5,5,Sun Jul 12 05:30:29 2015 UTC,"There is no direct route from IP to home address and/or phone number in like some big database or some software. You can get an approximate location, you can get a home town and thus paired with a name likely a Facebook and Skype, eventually you get a massive digital trail which contains all kinds of data.  Unless you shared your phone number and/or address somewhere on the internet there is literally no way anyone can find your address/number through your IP address. Unless, obviously, you're the only one with your last name living in a small town and the IP goes to an ISP substation in your hometown, which means that if you're in a phone book or something they could just look up your phone number like anyone could."
Twitch,3cyb3g,Daylen,0,Sun Jul 12 06:00:06 2015 UTC,Assholes use IP address to SWAT people all the time.

However, I've been taught name/address/numbers can be found through IP addresses. Takes work, and what to do, but it's a very real possibility. https://www.priv.gc.ca/information/research-recherche/2013/ip_201305_e.asp"
Twitch,3cyb3g,Daylen,3,Sun Jul 12 06:35:19 2015 UTC,"Again, digital trail. That page still shows that there is no way to go directly IP > address or IP > phone number, there's just ways to find out what an IP address has done and there's info on roughly where it is which with some cleverness can lead to in most cases a few good candidates and in some other cases a specific person."
Twitch,3cyb3g,TheMissingLink5,0,Sun Jul 12 06:38:39 2015 UTC,"I agree, we're both saying the same thing pretty much. I just took it as, an IP address won't get you anywhere, when in fact, that's the start to it all..."
Twitch,3cyb3g,Daylen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah but then again, I doubt IP is relevant here since you can't simply get the IP through Twitch (you connect to Twitch servers not the broadcaster since broadcasting a couple thousand streams at various qualities from one streamer's PC would be pretty bad)..  Either way, some info leaked somewhere"
Twitch,3cyb3g,TheMissingLink5,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:03:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%. I'm waiting on OP to confirm or deny if he told the mod about the incident or not. If he didn't tell the mod what happened, it's point black, 100%, the mod who did it. If he did tell the mod, there is still a huge chance it was him.  I know it's hard to gain the IP from Twitch for a broadcaster, but for a viewer in the chat to have this happen, seems not possible what so ever."
Twitch,3cyb3g,shadowrelic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:32:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure how Twitch chat works, think it's just IRC. Would be possible to get a hostname and if it's the default (probably Twitch's own network so they won't allow custom hostnames) it would get someone close. Broadcaster and mods are generally in chat too so it would kinda make sense if it really was like that but that's a long way from an actual address..  It's likely just the mod who was able to get the IP through skype, tracert it to town/city and then use first + last name of OP who he happens to have enough details of to find the home address and through that a phone number is easily found too."

Twitch,3cyb3g,kroom_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:07:17 2015 UTC,They can also call the ISP and sniff information out. This is why the isp should always ask for account numbers or other personal information before even talking to the person on the phone. It's annoying to us who are legit calling but could save someone else calling and getting your personal info.
Twitch,3cyb3g,Daylen,-3,Sun Jul 12 07:30:17 2015 UTC,"lol wrooooonnngggg, it's not impossible at all... If I do an ip lookup on my ip, the location it gives me is just a few meters from my house...  Btw genius, how the hell do you think those location queries from websites like Google maps work? They get your current location from your ip, or did you think your pc had a GPS tracker?"
Twitch,3cyb3g,NormThaPenguine,3,Sun Jul 12 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"The accuracy depends very much on your ISP. When I look up my IP I just get a location roughly in the town I live in, Google maps doesn't do a better job either. Google however has a different trick for positioning you - it can use your phones location history, and then show it on the website version as long as you are logged in."

We took it a couple steps further even towards actually trying to get private data from a random person's first name and IP address with a few different people from a forum we had moderator access to, which was surprisingly easy with the digital trail people leave behind. Didn't do anything bad in the end, nothing specifically illegal, just checking out how it actually works.  But all in all, IP address is nothing, you need at least a first and most often a last name to get anything. Some IPs might give you a direct address or street name but most won't."

Twitch,3cyb3g,LtCuppycake,3,Sun Jul 12 23:31:11 2015 UTC,It's very easy to dig up information on people. Virus scans wouldn't pick up the type of virus used to get into your computer.

There are sites that can legally have your information available (name, phone number, and address) because they are considered public domain. If it could be found in a telephone book, it can be online. The same with your mod. It just takes a little digging online and maybe a fee of a few dollars for them to easily have that kind of basic information. They can do it without even ever getting your IP or ""hacking"" anything of yours."

Twitch,3cz2gv,lefondler,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:20:19 2015 UTC,Still not safe. A regular PayPal account still uses your real name/address from the financial statement that is created. A Business account lets you create a business name and does not send your address on the final billing statement.   Example:  PERSONAL PAYPAL Name Address  BUSINESS PAYPAL Name of business you created.

Should anyone do anything you listed above, report them (try to include proof).     Don't click random links. I recommend getting a bot to filter unpermitted links as they could contain malware or an IP grabber. This IP can help people to find out where you are in world. Don't give out Skype information. Make sure said Skype information is not similar to your Twitch ones. Set up a Skype proxy. Don't give out many personal details.

Twitch,3cz2gv,thatlookslikemydog,2,Sun Jul 12 08:38:26 2015 UTC,"I used to stream on JTV, and doxxing and hacking were VERY common over there as a streamer.  A few tips that I have learned (which still haven't prevented it 100% but lowered the chances).  Use 1 username (or slight variation of) for all streaming-related activities, and make sure NONE of them have your real name attached.  That means make a dedicated email solely for twitch/paypal/etc and make sure your password security is on lockdown (I usually use a good old fashioned pen and paper for recording all of my passwords).  All it takes is a hack into your email, and all of your login information can be stolen (think password resets, etc). Don't even use a variation of your username for anything personal-related or send emails back and forth to your personal account.  Make sure to use 2 step authentication on all log-ins & also have notifications set up for when you log in (I get texts/emails for facebook/twitter/etc).  If you have multiple social media accounts (facebook/instagram/twitter/linked in), don't xpost pictures with your personal accounts. They can do a reverse google image search from your streaming-related accounts and find your personal accounts VERY easily.  If you are setting up any accounts that need your actual personal information (paypal/domains/etc), get a PO Box so that you can use that address.  If you live in a recognizable city (e.g., Vancouver, where I'm from), do not show the stream anything outside of your window.  It's very easy to find out the building you live in from a quick look (especially if you have VOD).  Set up a business paypal account and MAKE SURE you are using your business name and not your real name.  I like to go a little google search of my username every once and a while just to make sure nothing has popped up connecting my accounts.  Luckily I have a very common real name, so it's hard for people to find my personal accounts, but the dedicated ones still do."

Even a malicious viewer who knows a low-level Facebook employee could screencap your stream (assuming you use a webcam), then have them run it through the Facebook database. Even if you yourself don't have an account, there's a possibility someone you know (coworker, relative, etc) could have a picture of you up on the site somewhere.   If you have a facebook account and have posted pictures, you have probably run into that feature where suggests friends to tag. How would it work? Through Facebook recogniction. Yes, I've personally seen someone identified on Twitch by this method. Heck, you can find these people with this sort of DB access on specific forums willing to identify individuals for a mere $50 a pop.

Twitch,3czn3y,luckyariane,2,Sun Jul 12 09:25:34 2015 UTC,"While in this case due to the streamer banning you when questioned it is very likely they were viewbotting, keep in mind that hosting can often make a stream look viewbotted.  I had someone question my stream recently after I was hosted by one of the larger streamers for the game I was streaming.  I had over 400 viewers at the time and less than 100 followers.  Also keep in mind that during a large host, only a subset of viewers will actually go to the hosted streamers page, anyone watching from the host's page won't show up in the hosted streamer's chat.  I don't know exactly what number I had in my chat, but it would have been significantly less than the 400 viewer count I had.  Now granted when the person questioned them, my mod quickly explained that I had been hosted, and my chat was fairly active at the time as the host was rather recent at the time.

I mod for a talented young lady who streams her heart almost every day for 4-5 hours per day for almost 2 years now. She regularly has 30 - 60 people in chat and does everything she can to promote a fun and engaging streaming environment. At least 5 times I can recall, usually right after declining to give her server details to some new guys in chat saying ""hey baby, you sexy give me the IP for the server and I will come give you awesome gear!"" then when they don't get what they want suddenly her viewers jump up to 800 even though she's not being hosted and some of the new people in chat start accusing her of view botting."

If it's a viewer that you had no idea would ever make racist remarks, then that's out of your control and the best thing you can do is not allow them to play any more (Though personally, I would just kick them off my stream).

Twitch,3cziq1,jmsucre,4,Sun Jul 12 05:02:56 2015 UTC,"First off,  I'd definitely recommend a good usb mic if you don't have one.  The AT2020, Blue Yeti/Snowball, or Samson Go are all pretty good microphones.  Next get a pop filter if you can.  After that, you'll need your streaming program, like OBS (free open source/local recording software) or xSplit (costs like $20 I believe). With that you should be able to setup your stream along with the general appearance of the stream.  Some other programs I use are Twitchalerts (Sub, donation, or follower notifications), Photoshop (to edit overlays, whether it's one so bought or one I made, I use both.), and if you want, a video editing software.   I use powerdirector to edit videos for my YouTube channel, Justlegos.  However programs like Adobe Premier and Sony Vegas are excellent if you can afford them.  Editing VOD's is optional, but I have a larger audience on YouTube that on Twitch (Im still a uber small streamer and youtuber), but it all depends on what you want.  Generally, do what sounds fun!  You don't need an expensive mic to start, but they're great to have eventually.  Same goes with programs, ect.    If you need any help feel free to message me.  I could also help you with overlays if you'd like.  I'm not amazing at designing them, but I find them fun to work on.  Your computer should be fine for streaming, I currently am using a GTX 980 and it works great for every game I throw at it.  Maybe eventually I'll do SLI for fun, but as a broke college student, that'll be a while!  Best if luck!  Feel free to pm me, I'll be riding home from the Grand Canyon, but I should be home tomorrow.   EDIT: I forgot to mention Nightbot.  I use that to moderate Chat to prevent phishing links while also banning certain words.  There's similar software to that, but I find it easy enough to use, plus the autoDJ and request song feature can be nice."
Twitch,3cziq1,Justlegos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:37:18 2015 UTC,"JustLegos gave a pretty awesome rundown, but I'll drop in a few more tidbits.   OBS is amazing. However, it might not suit your needs. For some of the features, additional setup is required, such as installing an OBS plugin called CLR Browser, which allows using webpages as capture sources. (Saves you from having to run an actual browser in the background, as well as a few other useful little tricks) NightDev actually provides a repackaged version that includes a handy install script as well. I think xSplit supports embedded webpages by default, but I'm not 100% sure on that. I've so far used OBS exclusively. Speaking of NightDev, he has a plethora of tools at your disposal, and is probably one of the most trusted non-official Twitch devs out there. NightBot is probably his most well-known project, but I'll talk a little more on bots in the next point. Anyway, his website has an astounding amount of tools for Twitch (under Projects). Here are a few more you might find useful:   Chatty - A chat client that's got some nifty tools such as graphs of people in chat, chat logs, and much more. Useful for either just keeping up on chat, or for use in displaying your chat on screen1. Ultimate Twitch Bot - A client-run (you run it on your computer) bot that handles things like contests, loyalty points2, timed messages, and more. A couple alternative bots are AnkhBot, NightBot, and MooBot (NightBot is suuuuuper feature-rich, with everything from automatic chat moderation (CAPS protection, link protection, long-message protection, etc., MooBot is as well, though I haven't used it myself) TwitchAlerts - This is sort of an all-in-one thing for statistics, donations, follower alerts, donation alerts, and a few other tidbits. Honestly, none of the alternatives really compare in terms of functionality or ease of use.  Remember your ABCs. Always Be Chattering. You might have a few dozen people watching you off the bat, or (unfortunately the more likely possibility) you might have nobody watching you. I know I've done a few 2+ hour streams where there was nobody. At all. It was just me, myself, and two hours of commentary on whatever the hell came to mind. The most important thing to remember, is you need to be entertaining. You could try and find a niche, or you could stay rather general and just play what you feel like. The most important thing to remember is to not get discouraged. I think it took me a week's worth of streaming or so before I got any real interaction from the chat, but that feeling was amazing. Also, it doesn't hurt to tell your friends to watch. Microphones are important. A talkative host is an entertaining host, though it doesn't do much good if people can't understand what the hell you're saying. At the same time, don't think you have to go spend another $100 on a microphone just for streaming. Especially since I think the Razer Kraken has a decent one. Decidedly better than most built-in microphones. Admittedly, it will pale in comparison to a $100-$300 microphone. I've heard good things about the Blue Yeti, though it's worth it to do your own research. Once again, you really probably won't need one off the bat, or at all. Watch out for spam, scams, and shams. Unfortunately, the internet can be filled with terrible people. It's a sad fact. It's important to protect yourself from them. Just as a general rule of thumb, avoid downloading anything from random people. Some people might try something along the lines of ""Hey, your sound isn't working. Try downloading this audio driver. [insert evil link here]"", or claiming to be from Twitch support, asking for your Stream Key, or shit like that. Just remember that those people are scammers, trolls, or something of the like. When in doubt, don't do it. You might not need this kind of warning, but I see people in here every day that have been the targets of bad guys, so just keep yourself safe so you can keep streaming for years to come!   Hope that my rambling points were at least of some use. Good luck with the streaming! Hopefully I can stop in one of these days. Feel free to shoot me a message if you need help with anything, and I'll do my best.   [1] Displaying your chat on screen can be useful for a number of reasons. Whether it be to give context in your VODs, so if someone asks ""What's your favorite species of pineapple?"", people who don't have the chat open won't be as confused as to why you just started rambling on about why Pernambuco pineapples are the best, and that people today don't get enough Bromelain.  [2] It's nice to reward your viewers sometimes. Not everyone can or will, and that's fine. If you want to reward your viewers, a loyalty system can be a fun way to do that. Allowing viewers to earn points as they watch your stream can increase engagement, and just generally be a fun time. Hell, they don't even have to do anything."

Twitch,3cvx5f,SkittlesAreTasty,3,Sat Jul 11 14:48:13 2015 UTC,"Can you talk any kind of numbers in regards to donations at the level you're at right now? 6 months was going to be my evaluation period for whether or not it was worth doing ""full time"" (That is, 6 hours a day with the help of my friend). I figure if we can get a few hundred a month just to bring down rent, it'll be more than worth it. I've always loved streaming, just because I really do love attention, but obviously some money would be an incentive to have longer streams."
Twitch,3cvx5f,SkittlesAreTasty,2,Sat Jul 11 06:29:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say at this level it is nothing that I would consider more beyond some play money (few hundred dollars total). I am extremely grateful for all that has been given to me and for the support, but it's not anywhere near enough that I would do it if I didn't absoutely love streaming and playing videogames. If I was doing this for a fulltime job, I would stop and go get a job bartending or something to make WAY more money."
Twitch,3cvx5f,TheTranceGG,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:43:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, that's about what I was expecting to read. Keep up the good work!"
Twitch,3cvx5f,SkittlesAreTasty,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:57:00 2015 UTC,The amount one streamer makes from donations will be drastically different than another's. Much like subscriber revenue / ad revenue. It all depends on who your followers are.
Twitch,3cvx5f,Statuemantv,2,Sat Jul 11 06:46:05 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, I didn't even think about that. I guess it'd be impossible to predict, kinda like how CPM changes between youtubers."
Twitch,3cvx5f,SkittlesAreTasty,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:58:53 2015 UTC,"Donations are a bonus to what you earn and should never be added into the equation when deciding if to take streaming full time.  Not only are they super inconsistent in terms of how many donations aswell as the amount being donated, there is also the chance of it being charged back.  Income generated bu subscribers and ads however is more consistent, sure you can lose/gain subscribers but for the most part there is usually a number streamers tend to hover around, when that number becomes something you could potentially live off of then that is when you might want to think about going full time, also you know when somebody subscribes that is 2.50 in the pocket for that month which will be paid by twitch so its pretty safe compared to a random donation."
Twitch,3cvx5f,Statuemantv,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:38:50 2015 UTC,"Woah, so you only get half of the 5 dollars a month that subs are paying? I didn't think Twitch would take 50%."
Twitch,3cvx5f,Tapeworms,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:49:16 2015 UTC,"yeah twitch takes 50% of the subscription fee although i know you can negotiate more, some streamers get more than 50% but im not sure at what point they are open to negotiate, i would guess the more you have the more open they would be to it"
Twitch,3cvx5f,TheOriginalKiiD,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:53:20 2015 UTC,"Never agreed with the argument.  Despite donations being up and down, there is still a month minimum that you can be sure you are going to hit (I am talking once you are streaming for a couple hundred+ people, which you should be if you are considering going full time)."

Twitch,3cvx5f,Jesuswept669,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:15:11 2015 UTC,I really appreciate this post and how detailed you are. I still can't figure out what exactly I need to do to ramp up my follower and view count. I have good quality everything and I've been pretty on point with my commentary and interaction especially my past few streams. My game choices aren't the most popular but they still have decent communities. I streamed hitman last night and it organically turned in to me trolling the game and was really funny and fun. Had some new viewers pop in and lurk but no follows.
Twitch,3cvx5f,Astral_KaT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"I would say really be honest with yourself. Go sit through a couple hours of your stream and ask yourself if you would want to continue watching or check out another channel. One thing I notice a lot with people who aren't growing is that they believe they have a great stream and don't work to change it up. Gotta really scrutinize everything and work hard, especially when the viewers are so thin"

I'm a new parent as well so I've found keeping a consistent time to be the hardest part. I need to work around naps and feeding and bedtimes and most of the time I'm pretty exhausted as well.

This weekend I'm on vacation so everyone knows that, then on Monday or Tuesday they'll be able to check in and see my schedule for the week. I think it's not Quite as good as an every week/day same schedule, but I just can't do that and it sounds like that would be tough for you too."
Twitch,3cvx5f,musicchan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:29:38 2015 UTC,"It depends on if I manage to get my schedule more set. I have a general idea of how a day will go between his feeding and sleeping schedule but I need to make sure I also get more work done and get better sleep so I can be awake when he's napping.  That's a good idea though, the weekly thing.  There will be times when I have more going on than normal due to doctor's appointments and all that jazz so it's a good alternative to an ""every day at this time"" schedule."

Look, I'm not saying it's smart to try to start streaming while being a new parent, but I've not been known to make smart decisions."
Twitch,3cvx5f,lynxzyyy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:25:54 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat as you. 4 year old boy. I can't do anything stream or game related until after his bedtime. And then if I start my stream at say 9 pm and go till 1-2am I have to be up to start the day at 7am which can cause major burn out. So I tend to take days off from streaming to keep my sleep up anyways. So far so good. I'm up to almost 700 followers. Slow and steady. Gl!!

When he goes to kindergarten I will have more free time. :) good luck to your stream as well! It's possible to do (streaming), but certainly takes a different approach for us parents. I find getting the right amount of sleep and being coherent enough the next morning to ""mom"" is the most difficult challenge. My son has infinite amounts of energy. Thank goodness for minecraft. So, in a way you get a little more free time, but be careful because free time is never free haha, if they are being quiet there is usually a good or very bad Reason. ;) of course every child is different and you might have been blessed with a little angel."

In OBS, I'm pretty sure you can make the microphone the Astros once you have them plugged into your PC.  Regarding your questions,  yes, OBS will get your voice, in-game noise and whoever is in your party and game noise.  People in-game tend to be quieter than in a party though.  You can also have your friends in a skype call through your computer to make it easier for the stream to hear them or any audio service like TeamSpeak etc....

I really don't think that it's the mic its self though, as I've never seen it happen with DXTory. Granted, I've not ever recorded for the same length of time as I stream with my current setup, but idk.  Thanks anyway. :)"
Twitch,3cyr3b,PumpkinMilkshake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:26:04 2015 UTC,"What kHz is your audio at in OBS? I know sometimes if I'm streaming at 48kHz and the computer is set to 44.1kHz, it can make my voice sound way deeper, but I can't really see how it's cutting in and out of sounding normal and weird.. If anything, check to see if either your recording device in Windows is mismatched with what you have it set to in OBS. Other than that, I don't really know. Sorry :c"
Twitch,3cyr3b,PumpkinMilkshake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:07:37 2015 UTC,"Well, the computer is at 44.1 and OBS was 48, so I'll give that a go... Other than that, I'm not sure what else I can do. I think I'ma just run a stream for a couple hours and actually record the files at the same time, so I can see whether the issue is actually OBS/my computer or if it's something with Twitch.  Hopefully changing OBS to 44.1 will fix it though. It's just weird with the cutting out thing, agreed."
Twitch,3cyom7,ANIMATE1016,3,Sat Jul 11 23:53:37 2015 UTC,"integrated graphics will not be enough. Stick some cheap old gpu in there, that will work.  the reason is OBS still needs the gpu to render some things, you don't have to use it, it just needs to be there and set as the default gpu in obs's settings. without it, your capture card is going to eat a ton of cpu resources it would otherwise not eat up.  EDIT  do not confuse integrated graphics with integrated GPU. they are two different things. if you have an integrated radeon GPU for instance (although rare) you'll be fine. if you have one of those amd cpu/gpu things, you'll be fine. stuff like intel HD are not really considered a GPU, they are just integrated graphics, which (at least in my experience) isn't enough for obs."
Twitch,3cyom7,distortednet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:53:42 2015 UTC,"I'll attest to this as well. From experience, broadcasting at 720p/30 FPS was capable with the integrated GPU, but rewatching the vods would point out small graphical errors like artifacting and such. As soon as I added a GPU (nVidia 750Ti in my case), the artifacting went away and if i wanted to, I could up it to 720p/60FPS casting."
Twitch,3cyom7,drelloktv,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:08:15 2015 UTC,Can u recommend a gpu I'm looking at a GT 730 or a bumping up to the gtx 750 or 770?

Is there a recommendation between the two?   Side note: I'll be selling my i5 4690k CHEAP. $150 out the door with PayPal
Twitch,3cyom7,EDGAR_SEC,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:50:08 2015 UTC,"Jim (and other devs) over at the OBS forums has stated many times that the iGPU is usually more than enough since the GPU only composes the scene. The real brunt of the work is done by your CPU.  Here's a quote from a mod over there saying the same thing.  Back when I had a 4.6ghz 4770K in my dedicated stream PC, I was able to push out a 960p/60fps stream (at Fast preset and downscaled from a 1440p canvas) while only using the iGPU."
Twitch,3cyom7,distortednet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:55:48 2015 UTC,"maybe if you're not changing cpu presets, but i don't see why you wouldn't if your gonna dedicate an entire rig to it. I was using an integrated card in mine, and the cpu usage would peak anywhere from 80-100%. on a whim i threw my old radeon hd 5770 in there, and the cpu dropped to a much, much more reasonable amount."
Twitch,3cyom7,EDGAR_SEC,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:44:19 2015 UTC,"The GPU has virtually zero bearing on the encoding when using x264. Any of the more recent i5 and i7 iGPUs are more than up to the task. What is your specific CPU model? The only thing I can think of is maybe you are running an obscene amount of Global sources (more specifically video overlays).  A reason why you might not throw in a discrete GPU is that you were using a miTX form factor (like I was) and had the PCIe slot taken up by an internal capture card. I'd post a highlight of mine (BF4, ie a high-motion game) from when I would use the iGPU in the 4770K while streaming at 960p/60fps Fast preset, but I don't know if that would be considered advertising."

Have even put a lot of videos, images, video sources in a scene just to test it and it ran everything perfect.  I had tried a GT 240 card thinking that GPU wasn't a issue, but was surprised to see the weird issues it caused. The biggest was that everything would say it was doing 60fps, but you could look at the source window and see the video was only doing about 15fps. There was a lot of artifacting and such when adding a lot of things to a scene.  The GPU may not need to be the newest thing out there, but it does have to have some power to it."

Very useful information when I was digging for my stuff for my setup. =)   I personally use 2 neon-green plastic stuff that works just fine that my wife got for $2 for them.

Right now you have a whitish spot in the middle of whitish green, which could be tricky. Do some googling for three-point lighting   Anyway, the way I do my settings with slightly dodgy lighting is this:   Use the colour picker to choose a nice spot that sits in the middle of the colour range of the screen. Whack up the similarity until the screen disappears.  Dial it down until you're fully visible. If most of the screen is once again visible, pick a different-coloured spot until you find one that works. You should be fully visible with maybe a halo or some speckling around the place. Whack up the second setting until the speckles are down to something you can live with. Fiddle with the blend spill reduction a bit so that you look human and don't have a green halo. I barely use this myself.   Also: get your camera to figure out the right white balance and then turn off the auto-balance setting."

Twitch,3cxq5a,ComradeAlec,3,Sat Jul 11 18:45:08 2015 UTC,stream what you want. Many people stream a variety of games.
Twitch,3cxq5a,catdragonnamedrose,3,Sat Jul 11 18:53:03 2015 UTC,"Variety streaming is fine. Your best bet though it to spend as much time on a single game as you can enjoy. If it's a RPG, do all the side quests or similar so you're part of that community longer to attempt to draw in more people from that game community. If people enjoy your stream some will follow to other games."
Twitch,3cxq5a,iambgriffs,3,Sat Jul 11 18:57:06 2015 UTC,"I think as long as you're comfortable with what you're doing that's the most important thing. The people will come and watch if you're having fun or have good banter, I don't think it matters if you switch games often or not. It may actually bring some freshness to your stream too!"
Twitch,3cxq5a,ragnarrtk,2,Sat Jul 11 19:09:55 2015 UTC,I'm in full agreement with these folks ^ I am a partnered variety caster which hopefully showcases that you can be successful by mixing it up in your show. I personally feel that variety allows you to appeal to a multitude of viewers and will (imo) help the channel stay fresh. I for one am not for watching someone play the same game over...and over...and over :p Many successful variety casters DO have a dedicated game they play on a set day while other days are for something fresh. Best of luck and stream on brother!
Twitch,3cxq5a,Smokaloke_Twitch,2,Sat Jul 11 19:16:33 2015 UTC,If people are coming to see YOU then it won't matter too much what game you play so make sure the show is about how you play games rather than just another way to see a game and you will do great!
Twitch,3cxq5a,MattPeddlesden,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:35:55 2015 UTC,"You can make it as a variety caster, but it is significantly harder if you do not have some sort of recurring game. There are so many couch-type ""chill and play what I feel like"" streams that you need to be VERY entertaining to make yourself stand out. Not impossible, just know what you are getting yourself into."
Twitch,3cxq5a,44moth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:37:07 2015 UTC,"If you haven't yet reached the point where people come to watch YOU then you may want to stick to one game.  When I first started streaming I stuck with just one game and I was determined to do everything possible in that game until I was done. While playing this game I would have upwards of 40 people watching me at once, which I thought was pretty good for just my second or third day streaming.  These numbers did eventually drop but I still managed to get 20+ viewers sometimes. When I was finally done with that game and moved on to a new game I noticed a huge drop in my viewers, I would barely manage 5 viewers. Obviously most of the viewers I was getting was because people wanted to watch someone play that game. The game I moved onto was more popular than the first so people had more streams to choose from.  Still, as others have pointed out you should play what you want. You're probably going to burn out quicker if you're playing a game you don't want to be playing just for the sake of viewers."
Twitch,3cyfcp,oSnuggleBunnyo,4,Sat Jul 11 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"I would start with the following:    Scan your system for malware/virii/rootkits Change your IP (hinder DDOSing) and don't give it out Don't Skype with strangers, don't provide your IP in anyway to anyone, don't click links in chat and/or block all link posting Change your twitch password and possibly your stream key Remove all moderators (not sure how else they had access to banning unless they had your twitch password)"

I realize this doesn't necessarily help when it's already occuring but it can't hurt to prevent future attacks.  Some things I forgot to mention in my other response:   Unadd everyone you don't not trust on Steam. Steam has P2P messaging which allows people to obtain your IP without you even knowing.

I mean gtav sandbox I feel is only that fun for a hour and that's me just commentating. Another issue is I didn't want to ask days off of my lame go kart job that I work unpredictable hours 6 days a week. I figured that I should try and get viewers before taking off days to stream. If that's what needs done I can probably do it or wait u till I leave for college in a month and a half to get a consistent schedule. I just wanted to get a start before then.

Twitch,3cxpdt,Virus610,2,Sat Jul 11 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"1.) I use the USB version with a USB3.0 PCIe card, which kind of mimics the exact same process. I have zero problems with this method so I assume direct PCIe would work perfectly too.  2.) I personally use OBS and use Window Capture (not game capture or capture device) through the software. Works fine. You can just make it full screen and you can't tell the difference.  3.) Not entirely sure on that one. I use the portable version (http://www.amazon.com/AVerMedia-Portable-Capture-Xbox360-60Mbps/dp/B00B2IZ3B0/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1436642390&sr=1-1&keywords=avermedia)  With the portable version, you just do HDMI from the Console into the device, then USB into the computer. Really simple.  There is no delay at all. I use the software to play games on my monitor as if it were my TV."

Twitch,3cxpdt,Smokaloke_Twitch,2,Sat Jul 11 21:21:20 2015 UTC,"I personally have nothing but GREAT things to say about the Avermedia LGHD. On to the questions!  - 1. PCIE has virtually NO delay unlike many external USB cards (you won't have to deal with setting 300-1500ms delays!)  - 2.  I use OBS and it works almost flawlessly.   - 3.  The PCIE card is practically plug n' play. Connect HDMI console to the IN port of the CC (capture card) and simply connect your tv/monitor to the OUT port. From there, you can set OBS to recognize the Avermedia as it's own Video Source ( like you do a webcam) OR you can use the RECentral software for Avermedia and do window capture (this alleviates having to switch to a separate input on your monitor).   - 3.1 The PS3 is protected with HDCP. You have two options. You can either simply use the RECentral software mentioned above to window capture the PS3 OR you'll need to invest in an HDMI splitter :D  - 3.2 As mentioned above, the PCIE card is connected directly to your mobo and transmits the inputs with virtually no delay. I don't think the naked eye could see it even if we tried :p  Once again, I've had nothing but awesomeness from this card. It's a bit more costly than most externals, but WELL worth the money.

If so, those are awesome but difficult to make.  Or do you mean, for example a clock counting down for 5 mins while music is playing - giving eveybody time to show up? Those are great as well and I'm all in favor. I have music playing for around 5 mins and then I play my ""hype"" song and then I start talking..."
Twitch,3cw9uv,AvalonAngel84,3,Sat Jul 11 08:41:50 2015 UTC,I've seen a lot of streamers have music with a title card saying the stream is about to start soon why people are showing up.
Twitch,3cw9uv,luckyariane,5,Sat Jul 11 09:02:41 2015 UTC,I like having an intro because it allows me to start my stream on time even if I need a couple mire mins to get myself ready.   Even having only a few regulars it's nice to give them a few mins to get to my stream so I have some audience when I actually start.   What I do for my intro is stream a random clip from my previous broadcast so that if new viewers open my stream before I'm live they get a taste of what to expect and will hopefully stick around.
Twitch,3cw9uv,Statuemantv,3,Sat Jul 11 08:54:35 2015 UTC,"Intro depends on your following, maybe im wrong but i feel like alot of streamers, especially bigger streamers use intros like ""Starting soon"" to build up the viewers before they get into it so they are already rocking and rolling from the first second.  Where as smaller newer streamers are often streaming to very few viewers and often don't have any viewers for the first part of their stream anyway so it might be pointless imo  As for outro i think they are good for every streamer, i mean im not too fussed but i think its a nice touch instead of just cutting the stream dead, some streams usually put up a ""stream ending"" scene with a chill song and i think it rounds off the stream nicely"
Twitch,3cw9uv,Tapeworms,3,Sat Jul 11 08:44:58 2015 UTC,I like to use intros so I have people to say hi to at the start.  I don't use outro because we raid and send views to other streamers so it would be pointless
Twitch,3cw9uv,Korlian,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:03:25 2015 UTC,"I use intro, outro and brb screen for the same reasons already mentioned, but my main reason for doing especially the intro is so I have time to double check that everything is in order and running fine at my end.

Twitch,3cw9uv,Growlibi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:42:37 2015 UTC,Definitely a yes from me as a viewer - it allows hype to be built up for the coming stream and allows the streamer to interact with chat fully for x minutes at the start/end of the stream.

It's a wonder what some time in iMove/Sony Vegas/WMM will do. I have a video with license free music for an intro, break, and outro. Gives people time to hop in or as a buffer for you to get ready to stream."
Twitch,3cw9uv,thejdubb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:05:07 2015 UTC,I use a short intro into a countdown. It gives people a few mins to show up as well as make a smooth start because there is ususally a little banter at the beginning of the stream which is nice to have someone to talk to haha.  And I have a short outro.
Twitch,3cw9uv,MattPeddlesden,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:59:45 2015 UTC,I have a countdown timer on a start-up screen which runs a slideshow of images that my viewers send in which they really like. It makes sure people have a chance to get on the channel and gets the start of the show past the initial advert. They like to be there from the start so I start streaming 5 minutes ahead of schedule or so and start on the second once the timer finishes counting down.. They get excited about the clock starting and sometimes I tease them by leaving it for 10 seconds at 00:00:00 lol :)  I have a generic slide which uses the slideshow for any be right back purposes.   I then have a 'we are done' page which says when we are back and also runs the slideshow.. This also makes sure the stream properly ends rather than chopping the last few seconds off or something.   Hth
Twitch,3cw9uv,Jesuswept669,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:45:28 2015 UTC,I've always used them it just seems like the natural thing to do and adds a nice start thumbnail for my past broadcasts. I switch them up for each game as well. I also do a custom bathroom break screen for each game. They don't need to be that fancy but it's a nice way to keep things interesting for my regulars.
Twitch,3cw9uv,HRGSloth,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"I use both an intro and an outro for my stream. I really love the intro just because it gives me time to make sure everything is running fine while live and not just in preview. Also gives me a few minutes to tweet out that I've gone live and gives viewers a few minutes to get to the stream before we actually start.  My viewers seem to enjoy it as well. It's just a static screen with a winamp vizualizer overlay with music playing, but when Micksplosions comes on everyone knows the show is about to start.  I like having an outro as well. It's a nice way to bring the show to a close without an abrupt ending. I'll even use it just before sending my viewers on a raid and hosting the channel. It's just a personal preference of mine and it keeps the VODs looking nice and complete too."

Luckily, for the creative section, there aren't hundreds of channels yet so I pull in a few viewers, but I'm not even really paying attention to the viewers. I'm more or less using the platform as an excuse to practice my work, since I'm going to be at Fan Expo in September.  But yeah, the best advice I can give is to give yourself a specific schedule and stick to it, and don't worry about a few hours are followers right away, because they will come in time as long as you remain consistent.

Twitch,3cwn0c,smithy1294,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:17:33 2015 UTC,"As far as my research has gone in to this subject it seems to be a number of factors, I'm not an expert here so don't go using this as gospel, but I think it may have to do with the randomness of how Twitch delivers video.   For example, you could load the stream of a caster that lives in the apartment beside you and to get the stream, instead of going directly to it, your request will go from your PC, down the line to a central server, out of that server into another somewhere in Austria, France, Russia, Hong - Kong then to you again.   Because the website is constantly fetching data and this process is mostly random. It can take differing amounts of time for the stream to get to you. Also there are so many variables on the side of the streamer as well such as bitrate etc... If it's unbearably bad try using a different browser.  Again, this is the explanation that I have gathered from my own experience with the site, it could have no effect but it's the explanation that I believe the most after having reached several differing ones."

Connecting it to a monitor worked alright, but connecting it to my capture card didn't work. Nowadays I use my old capture card (AVerMedia Live Gamer Portable) to convert composite to HDMI. That works perfectly (albeit a little finicky)."

In my experience there are 4 kinds of viewers:  Viewers who never create an account and just watch online, serious viewers who follow/watch the streamers they follow, people who create accounts follow and forget about account, or people who create accounts and come back once in a blue moon."
Twitch,3cvv56,FanaticDreamer,2,Sat Jul 11 07:40:15 2015 UTC,Yeah this is pretty common. I mean think about it: how many people do you follow and how many do you actually watch?  So this is why it's not all about the follows for twitch but rather about the concurrent viewer numbers. :-D
Twitch,3cvv56,AvalonAngel84,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:41:29 2015 UTC,"I got this all of the time during the short time I streamed.  I imagine people think they're doing you a favor by throwing a follow your way even though they have no intention of actually watching your stream again, or they might already have 50 other favorite streamers that they already like so it's unlikely in the future you're going to be the only person on out of their favorite list.  But yeah. I noticed the vast majority of my followers never actually bothered to check out my stream again, or if they did it was very infrequently. Seems like most of my streams were filled with people who had never seen my stream before and never bothered to follow, even if they sat through my entire stream."

I have had some that say what OP is talking about, then i never see them for months, then they show back up and become a regular.  the only thing i can really guess as to whats going on here is people follow a lot of people and don't scroll to the bottom of their follow list, so the more viewers you gain, the more likely you are to be noticed on their list."

There are probably some people out there who just browse channels while they're bored until they find one that interests them then do the same thing the next time they decide to watch someone stream.  I also think a lot of people out there have favorite games over favorite streamers so they have a particular game they want to watch someone stream so if you're not streaming that game the next time they're on they're unlikely to watch your channel, after a few days they might just forget about you altogether."
Twitch,3cvv56,justmeandmyself10,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:10:27 2015 UTC,"But you would at least think that they would follow if they enjoyed your content enough to stay. You literally only have to look at the right side of the page in order to see if you're streaming, and what game you're streaming.  Quick question, though. So if you don't watch streams all that often, why don't you just watch popular streams then? If you're going to spend what little time you do on twitch, why not go to the stream that's bound to entertain you, because it's entertained thousands of other people? Do you not watch it because it's too mainstream maybe?  Maybe I misunderstood what you said, Iunno."
Twitch,3cvv56,hubsmash,2,Sat Jul 11 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"I follow a few streams I like to watch. If none of them are on then I look for a channel to watch based on the games I like to watch other people stream.  I don't really go for the big show some streamers like to put on, like singing or dancing on cam or doing silly things whenever they get a follower or a sub. I just like to watch people play the game.  I haven't checked out every single big streamer but I've checked out a few of them and I don't really like them. I think they either try way too hard (like the stuff I mentioned earlier) or they try way too little, almost as if they have reached the point where they can be as little entertaining as possible yet people still flock to their channel because they have thousands of viewers.  I don't buy the theory that just because a lot of people like a channel that it must be a good channel or that I'm going to like it. If that were the case Twitch would only need one streamer per game."

Twitch,3cvntu,Hydro_Master364,4,Sat Jul 11 03:58:52 2015 UTC,You don't necessarily have to talk (commentate) whenever you're playing the game.
Twitch,3cvntu,conceptional,2,Sat Jul 11 04:03:30 2015 UTC,"You don't need a mic or webcam, you don't even have to fill out any information below your stream."
Twitch,3cvntu,justmeandmyself10,2,Sat Jul 11 04:20:51 2015 UTC,..But having those things will greatly help.
Twitch,3cvntu,nekoyasha,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:04:28 2015 UTC,True but the person acknowledges his stream won't be very popular if he does this. I imagine he's not too concerned with gaining followers/viewers and is probably doing it so his friends can watch or something.
Twitch,3cvntu,justmeandmyself10,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:12:49 2015 UTC,You can certainly stream with no commentary and tons of 0-1 viewer streams are doing just that.   The question is why?  You're unlikely to gain any meaningful viewership. The only upside is if you want to record your gameplay without needing the local storage space. You'd get better quality just recording it locally though and HD space is pretty cheap.
Twitch,3cvntu,luckyariane,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:02:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all of your replies as some of you have mentioned, Yes it wont be popular but why should it be. If friends want to stop in and see what im doing on the server or just in general sharing the game play it is better than not sharing it at all. Thank you!"

All I want is a few people to chill and chat with.
Twitch,3cwdur,JoshTheSquid,2,Sun Jul 12 07:43:42 2015 UTC,"Heh, lots of people are responding to the frontpage thing even though it's somewhat irrelevant.  Just in case you're EsotericRambling on Twitch as well, I have to ask: do you ever talk during your broadcasts? The couple of broadcasts I saw were almost completely silent. If all your broadcasts are like this is it's no surprise nobody is watching them: you're not putting up a show people would like to watch. It's just gameplay.  We've all had bad days where we'd have to put up a show for nobody, but you have to put in effort and put up a good show. If you're not talking and not working on being a good host throughout the entire duration of the stream, you won't get any viewers."
Twitch,3cwdur,Shado_Temple,0,Sat Jul 11 13:40:23 2015 UTC,"I do talk when there are people in my channel. I know there's a lot of dead air in my latest broadcasts, that's because my viewcount was static at 1. If someone comes in and says hi I do engage with that person."
Twitch,3cwdur,JoshTheSquid,5,Sat Jul 11 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"In addition to what u/JoshTheSquid and many others mentioned, there's a logistical issue with your method as well.  Assume you wait until your view counter ticks up 1 before you begin speaking. For one, that view counter isn't perfectly live; it can take anywhere from a few seconds to a full minute for the count to adjust. And even when you do suddenly light up at the sight of said new viewer, it will take yet another 10-30 seconds for your acknowledgement to be actually sent to that viewer. You're now looking at 1:30 delay before your attempts to entertain get displayed, and for most viewers, that's enough silence for them to leave.  From my experience, you've got 30 seconds to hook a new viewer. If you haven't added anything of value to the game you're playing in those 30 seconds, you'll lose them. At this early point in your streaming career, that is devastating. When no one's around (and even when people are around), you've got to treat this like you're recording a video, rather than broadcasting it. The chat interaction/viewership is just a fun bonus when you're working with < 10 viewers, and until you acknowledge that, you'll never get anywhere here."
Twitch,3cwdur,JoshTheSquid,0,Sat Jul 11 23:09:36 2015 UTC,"First of all, I don't see it as a career, it's just something I do to burn time and distract me from loneliness, I don't really have huge ambitions with this channel.   I had another channel I streamed on before this one that I took much more seriously, it had almost 500 followers and I regularly had 20-30 viewers watching me. But internet drama happened and a woman sabotaged my channel and my name because she didn't like me.

I don't care about your previous account, your following or whatever happened. We're just giving you advice on how you stream now.  So, are you looking for advice, or for pity? And if you're not taking it seriously, why are you complaining about your viewership?  EDIT: I mean, it sounds like whatever happened sucked, but the fact is is that it's irrelevant to most of us. Harassment is a serious issue, but you've made this post looking for advice."
Twitch,3cwdur,JoshTheSquid,2,Sun Jul 12 09:41:25 2015 UTC,"That's not enough, and your viewercount being at 1 is no reason to be quiet. You should always be talking.  Waiting for people to interact with you is backwards thinking. It's your show and you're the host, so you should invite the people to interact with you. In other words, present yourself as a person who viewers want to interact with throughout the entirety of the stream. If you don't talk, for most viewers it'll like you're not even there and won't stay around."
Twitch,3cwdur,JoshTheSquid,0,Sat Jul 11 21:56:37 2015 UTC,"On my last stream last night I did make more of a conscious effort to be vocal. The thing is, everyone is leaping on the fact that there's 'dead air' in my broadcasts from watching 1 vod. Making assumptions about how I always stream from one sample size is a bit harsh."
Twitch,3cwdur,CaptNikolai-08,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:40:38 2015 UTC,"Do you want honest advice or not? If not, why are you even posting then?  Also, I said the following:   The couple of broadcasts I saw were almost completely silent.   I checked five or six. Fact is that the dead air thing is a common theme throughout at least most of your broadcasts. Even if this was just the case with your latest Dark Souls VOD (which it is not) it would mean that there's a lot to improve on. The occasional quiet moments aren't bad, but a whole stream worth of mostly dead air indicates there's a lot to improve on on the host side of things.  Talking about assumptions, you're downplaying the advice by assuming I've watched one VOD. That's not only rude but it also makes me wonder if you're interested in improving your stream at all."

Twitch,3cwdur,Accident_Pedo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:40:35 2015 UTC,"You're being aggressive for no reason. Yes, somewhere buried in your vitriol is advice, but the way you're going about it is needlessly confrontational.

I learned in my early days that talking aloud and asking myself questions aloud about the game tugged on most lurkers apparent need to be know it alls and answer said question. >.> Once they're talking, you can turn the conversation a bit."

Twitch,3cqplx,Jokosmash,8,Fri Jul 10 00:32:05 2015 UTC,"You mention that this is a free tool, and the website says that it is 100% free during beta. Now that point on the website makes me wonder are you planning on making this a paid system when it is done? Care to comment/clarify on that?  Other than that, this looks to be a great way to combine some of the biggest streaming overlay options into one product and I will have to check it out in the future."
Twitch,3cqplx,01hitwonder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:06:44 2015 UTC,"Yup, we absolutely plan to monetize the app. Although, we have no idea how. And beta is most likely going to last for quite some time while we collect feedback from our early users.  Right now, some of the other services like StreamTip, TwitchAlerts and TNotifier collect a percentage of donations. We're not sure if we want to do that. We're not sure what the users want yet. We're going to pretty much leave it up to you guys.  One thing is for certain: useful tools like this shouldn't be pay-to-use for all streamers. There are definitely people - like me - who only stream casually and don't need a service they have to pay for. I think no matter what we do in the future, we should always have some sort of consideration for people who have no need to pay.  Do you have any preferences on what we should do?"
Twitch,3cqplx,01hitwonder,4,Fri Jul 10 03:10:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you can provide a service that no one has tried and can do it in an effective and better way than the competition then you could monetize it and make money off of your work  However, if you charge for what your service does that the others do for free, you will have a hard time getting people to buy in.  But really, it could be a thing were you get most of the features for free, but create a much more premium/professional service or feature with the product that no one else has that you could charge a one time/subscription fee.  One last thing: If you are planning on monetizing parts/all of this service, you have to let the Beta people know when that would happen and whether or not they can keep using the service for free as legacy customers, or if they will have to start paying for it."
Twitch,3cqplx,Penderyn,5,Fri Jul 10 03:20:17 2015 UTC,"I really, really like the idea of only charging for something like Pro features, and maybe those features are only features that higher volume streamers use (aka people who stream as a business). That would definitely make a lot more sense.  And absolutely. We would never just spring a fee on our beta users. You have no idea how much joy we're experiencing right now from the number of users we've received from this thread and how much feedback we've gotten. I'd be crazy to turn my back on you guys."
Twitch,3cqplx,olopower,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"I definitely think you should monitize it. If you have the best product you could charge $20 for the Pro version - or, the other way to go about it, would be a small ($5 say) charge for every user. Depend which you think will make you more cash."
Twitch,3cqplx,HammerIsMyName,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:11:08 2015 UTC,"I'm glad for you and I support a program like this, dearly. However I think that higher volume streamers, as you call them, mostly hire ""private programmers"" to fix shit for them..  Maybe i'm wrong though"
Twitch,3cqplx,doomrah,2,Fri Jul 10 17:16:40 2015 UTC,"Yup, you're right. And that's another thing that we're bringing to the table for our users is probably one of the most high quality and hands-on user support that any of these platforms can provide. It's honestly our goal to be the one-stop shop for all LPers and streamers and that includes custom requests."
Twitch,3cqplx,glad_kill,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"Correction: Tnotifier is not a donation service and as such cannot collect a percentage of donations. It's purely an alert service and you have to connect a Streamtip, ImRaising or SupportTheStream account to use it's donation alerts.  Tnotifier used to be a monthly subscription service (Free for Twitch partners). I believe they went completely free now though I'm not certain."
Twitch,3cqplx,seriouscoin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:10:15 2015 UTC,tnotifier is free now.  i created an account about a week ago.  matter of fact i was hesitant because i remember it was subscription based at one point.

Twitch,3cqplx,illtakethebox,6,Fri Jul 10 00:45:21 2015 UTC,"A suggestion if you would like: A good feature would be a system similar to Photoshop's ruler system. Photoshop allows you to snap objects (pictures, text, anything really) to certain points on the document vertically and horizontally (25%, 50%, 75%, etc). Having the satisfaction of knowing your alert is exactly positioned 50% horizontally or vertically or whatever your preference is would be pretty helpful, so no one runs into situations where alerts would look off and would need constant readjustment. That being said, this is a totally great tool and is helping me make the push into attempting some streaming. Great job and I can't wait to see how it turns out!"
Twitch,3cqplx,illtakethebox,6,Fri Jul 10 06:24:14 2015 UTC,ᕦ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ᕤ  Ruler system. HECK YES. And grid snapping. We're going to work on that immediately. Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback. Stick around and I promise we're going to make this editor perfect very soon.
Twitch,3cqplx,illtakethebox,7,Fri Jul 10 06:26:19 2015 UTC,"For the love of god, I want a feature. I have custom designed fonts as a part of my overlay architecture and I'm carrying it all here. For the love of the elder gods give me the ability to add custom fonts. And also horizontal and vertical centering.  I love this, it is a really awesome piece of tool. I'm sick and tired of implementing a funky mix of Nightdev Followers, Tnotifier and Twitchalerts. It should all be one and the same. Sick and tired of having 4 CLR browser plugins loaded. Time to get my graphics guy to design a custom follower & donation alert for me finally as well :)  Also, text to speech for donation messages anytime soon? (Preferably in Turkish :P)  Edit: Please make us be able to choose colors by code as well! Matching the colors of the backgrounds of different alerts = tough!  And choosing currency. I need to be able to receive tips in Turkish Liras by default before I can utilize this service. The same choice should be added to donation goal and everything about tips in general."
Twitch,3cqplx,illtakethebox,3,Fri Jul 10 08:00:31 2015 UTC,"Add custom fonts. Check. We're going to host files for images, audio, and fonts in the very, very near future. It's literally like 3 bullet points down on our priority list.  Your comment just might've moved it up a notch.  Haha, text to speech would be awesome. I'm definitely not against it. It might not take priority over some features such as zooming, snap-to-grid, and file hosting though. Soon.gif.  Currency is also #1 priority. We just have to get the conversion code setup and that's coming next week.   Can you clarify the feedback about color codes?"
Twitch,3cqplx,illtakethebox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:30:53 2015 UTC,"Well, the background color for the widgets, right now you can select them with the sliders but no two colors look the same. There are color codes for that, like #FF002831 (<< that one is random) so if you paste the color code from a different widget, they will be the same color.    Simply saying that there is no color picker tool, only a radial slider :)    I love this. I think you can monetize this by donation amounts. Like, if someone is getting hundreds of donations daily, I'm sure they wouldn't mind. If one is getting one donation per week, that guy is better off without paying a thing, maybe?"
Twitch,3cqplx,illtakethebox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:46:22 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, yah. You're saying because we don't include the hex value for the widget BG color.  That's a very good point. Give us some time, that should be a very quick fix."

Step 2: Right click in your Desired Scene box and add CLR Browser as the scene  Step 3: Open the properties of the CLR Browser scene and paste your overlay URL.  This will allow you to layer the entire overlay on top of your stream scene. The background color will be transparent, so all that will show are the widgets you've added to your overlay.  Let me know if you need any further help. Happy to assist."

Twitch,3cqplx,imwaltermcd,2,Fri Jul 10 06:00:50 2015 UTC,"Hey! I sent an email, but I think this will be easier. I only used the program a little bit so I haven't given it a full look over.   I would really like for the overlay editor to have a zoom option. Having to scroll all around doesn't make working on an overlay that fun. I just want to be able to see my entire overlay at the same time. I made a 1366 X 768 overlay if that helps. I had struggles with implementing it into my OBS. When I launched the overlay some of the widgets didn't show up, and when I used the CLR Browser Plugin no widgets showed up. Not really sure what I'm doing wrong. It might also be beneficial to add an implementation guide on the site.   Keep up the amazing work, if this takes off it'll be big. I will definitely be using it once I iron out all my issues. :)"

I haven't checked it yet so I'll respond here:   I really, really wanted to enable a zoom functionality for our beta launch, but we decided to wait. I totally share your sentiment. This is something that is on the priority list though. I'll let you know when it's ready. Guides are a must have. We'll have some of those ready next week. Hm, if you can tell me which widgets weren't working, I'd be happy to fix this problem for you.   Thank you for your support, we're really excited to be welcomed by you so warmly."

XD   Something I would consider adding that TwitchAlerts has is a ticker for the people who donated in the current broadcast. They call them Stream Labels, and I use one for my stream, but it doesn't appear you have one (don't worry about putting it in super fast just yet. I personally don't get any donations :])  Also, is there a way to upload an mp3 file from my computer for alerts? If it's to be implemented than that's cool."
Twitch,3cqplx,PANDAmonium515,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:29:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, we have that :)  It's the widget called Donation Total, or you can also show the Top Donation that shows the username and the amount they donated."

Twitch,3cqplx,vvarpidgeon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:03:28 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! I want to make sure I understand correctly. You're saying you would like the ability to add images to your overlay and place them anywhere you want?

Twitch,3ct94f,keremimo,6,Fri Jul 10 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"Plenty of people grow that fast - Or faster. I went from 300 to 4k followers in 1½ month - I have had streams where I grew by 700-1200 followers in a single day. I don't think you have to be concerned about it being fake.  Don't focus on anything else than going live and doing your thing - Whatever you may feel like that is. Fuck Youtube and highlights - Barely anyone cares about them so there's absolutely no reason you should stress over it.  Unless you start getting thousands of viewers do not worry about anything else than streaming your games.   As for mods - Ask for applications. Ask for their full name, age, profession, timezone/country - The ones who give you a legit application can probably be trusted. Ask them to keep a .txt log of bans and timeouts and have them email it to you after every stream.   That's what I did."

Twitch,3ct94f,Skobee,11,Fri Jul 10 17:42:55 2015 UTC,You grew fast because your competition is low. I can't imagine there are hundreds of thousands of Turkish streamers out there.  Now what was your actual question?

Twitch,3ct94f,OrenjiNikku,2,Fri Jul 10 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"Well you need to look at the viewers PoV. Right now you're only thinking of yourself and the stream. Totally understandable to feel uncomfortable but think about it like this.  The viewer numbers are all because there are people who want to watch. Now everyone has their preferences and this is the important part. You seem to have gained viewers mostly in certain games. Playing those games will cause a lot of ppl to come watch. But what about playing a new game? Some will be curious and come to see. Others don't really want to see, so they might check out another of their followed channels.  The thing to understand is that numbers will fluctuate between games but you will always have curious people. This means that as you gain more followers, you will also have more people when playing a random game. All in all, don't worry about it so much; everything that is happening there is totally normal and understandable!  Also great job growing so fast! There must be many Turks excited for a local gamer. That's awesome bro and I wish you luck! (Might post again)"
Twitch,3ct94f,blakinola,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:48:56 2015 UTC,"Oh I see your main issue you said was that you grew too fast and can't find someone to relate with.

You shouldn't be worried about viewers at this point anyway imo  also /u/skobee is right about turkey - there's like, no one eastern european streaming in any meaningful capacity on any huge games, so you have yourself a niche you can fill.  Just remember streamers are a dime a dozen and you should work on growing your fanbase and appeasing whoever ends up tuning in."

I'm not really sure what some of your questions are.  I'm not even sure what you mean by ""losing touch"".    You're saying your ""time is exclusively taken by my full time job"".  Doing things like tweeting, making highlights at most take 5-10 minutes a day.  I think its up to you to stop using your work as an excuse and just do it. You don't even need to be constantly doing it- even just doing it on weekends is fine.   And once you have a few highlights, its not completely necessary to keep making them, just need a few for people to click on when you're offline.  I also work full time, and the only way I can fit everything in my life is sacrifice an hour or two of sleep."

Twitch,3ct94f,Mad_Orbitz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"Well the good thing is, tweeting and that other stuff really isn't even necessary.  I had no twitter or social media whatsoever for the first few months I streamed, and I don't think ""networking"" is even important, at least for me.  I wouldn't sweat the extra stuff if you don't have time, just concentrate on the content of your stream.  I usually don't even tweet out that I'm starting up my stream, since that is what twitch notifications are for.  To give you an idea, I stream with no webcam, at a terrible 1K bitrate, was using a cheap $10 half broken mic held together with masking tape, terrible graphics.  None of that mattered- if you can get people to click and come to your stream (which you obviously are accomplishing), then you're pretty much all set, and all that other stuff is secondary."

I am considering changing my channel into an exclusive Spanish channel, and some insight would be more than welcome :)"
Twitch,3cv3cf,FadedSlowBro,2,Sat Jul 11 00:46:07 2015 UTC,"If you play multiplayer games you could set up a system so that people could ""buy"" spots in the game to play with you (but I guess that could end up similar to a raffle unless you made it more of a queue). A friend of mine used to do gimmicky things for points too, like make up short poems and push-ups and things. I think he also had it so donations bought points though so I guess that's how that fit in. In a similar vein to bets, you could have people suggest different challenges/handicaps (within reason) for games too. Good luck, a fun points system can add so much to a stream and when done well can really show off the ways a streamer cares about his followers!!"

Other games that don't have this rating might also be disallowed if the content or focus of the game violates our Terms of Service or Rules of conduct.

Twitch,3cuvze,b3george,3,Fri Jul 10 23:48:17 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I'd try emailing support at getting an official answer on the specific title you're wanting to stream. Be warned though that their reliability on responding might be a little spotty.  About a month ago, I emailed the support email asking about streaming a specific title, but received no response after 2-3 weeks. Since I didn't get an official timely response, I did my own research. and found out the game was rated M (not AO), was not on the banned list, and that a Twitch staffer here on the subreddit posted that it was okay. Even though I thought I had all my bases covered, I ended up getting a 24 hour suspension. However, they lifted it maybe 17 hours in for some odd reason (I never got an actual notification on why I was suspended though).  So in the end, even if you get the go-ahead, you still might get suspended."

Your options are wearing a headset so your stream can hear you clearly but they can't hear who you're talking to or you can use your kinect mic which has bad quality but it won't look like you're talking to yourself.
Twitch,3ctz98,neoprophet,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:48:10 2015 UTC,You CAN use a headset/mic for the audio and the Kinect for video.  You cannot have overlays using soley the xbox streaming app.  Source: I streamed for over a year using just the xbox app.

Twitch,3cttdh,LeyTimTV,7,Fri Jul 10 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is a lot of people do throw their life away because they think it's so easy to become successful. One of the tips I often see given to people is to stream as often as possible, the more you're streaming the more exposure you're getting, the more exposure you're getting the greater chances at success.  That all makes sense and I'm not disagreeing, I think some people take this to mean that if they quit work/school and stream 14+ hours a day then they will succeed. Like it's just that simple. We have all heard stories of people doing exactly this.  I wasn't trying to be a Debbie Downer with my other thread, I just think people should be a little more realistic with their advice and streamers need to be a little more realistic with their expectations.  If you're able to pay your bills with your job or your streaming doesn't interfere with your ability to attend school then hey, stream to your heart's content."
Twitch,3cttdh,justmeandmyself10,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the encouragement. I'm a disabled Army vet and I make enough from my disability pay that I don't need to work if I don't want to. So about three months ago, I decided to take the plunge and try my hand at the wide world of streaming. I know I'm not going to get extremely famous streaming but I am trying to make it my full time job. When I first started out, it was fun and exciting. It was fun picking out which game I was going to play for the day. It was fun trying to poke myself into talking more and breaking out of my quite shell.   But this past week, I've been feeling kinda meh about it. I still have fun with streaming but I get these feelings of ""Why am I trying to choose a game? No one watches anyway.""   I know streaming for three months isn't very long but sometimes I feel so far behind everyone else. I know this is something that takes time and I shouldn't expect viewers right away. But after three months I always thought I'd be farther along than 40 followers and having one or two viewers pop in for a few minutes then leave again. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, I don't know.  I'm digressing from what I was trying to say though. I wanted to say thank you for renewing the fun and enjoyment I've had for streaming. I may not have the best games to stream or the best computer for it. But I'm going to keep at it and keeping learning about doing overlays and adding music/sound effects to my stream. So thank you again for the encouragement and the kind words."
Twitch,3cttdh,AmbassadorForThe90s,2,Sat Jul 11 09:00:40 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you for your service.  Feeling the highs and lows of streaming is something every broadcaster will go through, just as feeling the highs and lows of life is something every human being goes through. You're a disabled Army veteran, you know that better than anybody else. Streaming is a continuous process that involves a lot of trial and error. There's no one way secret to streaming; we all have different personalities, play different games, stream different times, and... we all find our own audience. Some will take longer than others to reach certain ""numbers,"" we all go at our own pace so comparing yourself to another won't help you. Don't ever look at your follower count or viewer count and feel like you're behind, because guess what? You're already miles ahead of the streamers who quit a long time ago.   I've had bad days of streaming and good days. I mean, I've even had really bad weeks where nobody showed up. But I kept the right mindset. Streaming takes hard work, dedication, desire, perseverance, and sometimes a little luck. Always be looking for ways to improve your stream or find out what you're doing wrong and always be hungry to learn.  Keep your head up, you'll get there. And when you do, boy does it feel good."

Twitch,3ctloo,DailyProblem,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:51:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of people say the logitech c920 is a good camera. I have that and the logitech C615. I would say for the green screen the c920 is pretty good and it does have a better picture. But its drawbacks is that there is no zoom and it cant swivel left and right. Now the zoom normally wouldn't be a problem but the c920 seems to be really far zoomed out, so you get a lot in the shot. I wish I could use the C615 but that one, for me at least, makes it hard to chroma the green screen as nicely as the c920. Maybe I should try the microsoft webcams..."

Twitch,3ctloo,Imagine42,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:12:56 2015 UTC,"What I use...    Webcam:  Logitech c920...I used to use a Logitech c615, but it became difficult to use chromakey once I transitioned to a green screen (it seemed to pick up ""noise"", for some reason).  I switched to the c920 this week, and the improvement is dramatic (in my opinion).    Green Screen:  I ended up going for a DIY kind of thing, at least for the screen.  I picked up a few yards of green fabric from a local craft shop and hung it like a curtain in my streaming room.  This cost ~$7.  Now, lighting is a different story...while I was able to ""get by"" with natural light and a little desk lamp, I started to get artifacts on the screen as the light profile in the room changed.  I subsequently bought a studio light kit from Amazon for ~$70, which makes things look much cleaner.  That said, extra lighting isn't ""required"", but it will help increase the quality of your stream.    Headphones:  I use the Audio Technica ATH-M40x, which are very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  I don't tend to go for the ""game-centric"" features of some headphones...for me, I'd rather get a quality pair that functions well in most situations, as opposed to one that's designed for gaming (i.e. bass heavy, gimmicky features like footstep awareness, etc.).    I can't help with the chair, as I just use a simple office chair from an office supply store.    If you include lighting, those purchases would take you ~1 - 1.5 months to gather (assuming a $40 / week budget)...it's not instant gratification, but it's not all that far off either.  :)    PWB"
Twitch,3ctloo,PancakesWithBaconPWB,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:33:03 2015 UTC,"As a webcam i use the Microsoft 5hw Studio webcam, its around 50€ and I can say for me its better then logitech as i had massive Problems with my green screen with the c920. My greenscreen is a selfmade Black screen for around 15€ with my normal desk lamp from ikea for 7€. For headphones i use some in ear sennheiser, with a volume changer that doesnt affect the Sound going out to Twitch.   For a chair i can recommend the ikea Office chair Markus, its a little bit over your price range but its a great chair and I can set for almost a year over 10 hours a Day on it without having any Problems."
Twitch,3ctloo,DerikTI,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"I recommend investing in the c920 first. That way, you can start streaming with your blue snowball mic to start getting donations or tips.  Next, selecting a green screen would be wise if you wish to play different games that take up the entire screen. You can invest $17 in a quality screen from Amazon or buy a $1-2 table cloth as long as the color is consistent. You may have to spend additional funds on lighting and something to hold the screen behind you, as the do factor into how good the green screen comes out.  A nice headset would be anything if your preference, although I reccomend audio technica products or comfort and longevity.  A nice chair I have invested into a DX racer, looks great on stream, but does not have the comfort of an office chair. My opinion is that office chairs are more comfortable, but have a shorter lifespan.   If you acquire these items in order, stream tips and donations could help you out!  Best of luck"
Twitch,3ctloo,siderman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:13:36 2015 UTC,"I have this office chair and it's worked out really well. Definitely one of the most comfortable desk chairs I've sat in (which is remarkable since it's not super heavily padded) and it's kept up very well over the last few years.  I don't really have any good recs for other things, but with the green screen, if you're using the alpha version of OBS studio you can add masks to your web cam that can effectively crop out anything not hidden by the screen. It's a neat feature too in that you can play around with different webcam shapes (which works out really well for those of us who don't have good lighting for green screens)."

Twitch,3ctoxb,ifsnacker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:14:53 2015 UTC,The c920 is a great camera. The microphone is pretty awful though. I'd really recommend going up to either a Blue snowball/yet or a AT2020USB for a mic.
Twitch,3ctoxb,iambgriffs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:28:03 2015 UTC,"If you ever consider getting a boom arm, go for the AT2020, as its much cheaper to buy a boom arm and shock mount that supports it compared to the yeti.  The yeti is a fantastic mic, it just costs an outrageous amount for the shock mount and a boom arm that can support its weight.  I just switched from the yeti to the AT2020 for this reason.  Both are fantastic mics, the yeti's accessories cost much more than the At2020."

Obviously not ideal if your viewers aren't from the west coast of the USA.  If you're not dropping frames in OBS, and you're using a reasonable bitrate to stream with (like 2500Kbps or below), then there's nothing you can do about it.

Just delay the mic/cam by 700ms and it should be fine.    If you've got other PC audio you need to delay, you can use the Global Audio Offset in Advanced settings in OBS to delay everything by 700ms, then set the Elgato audio delay to -700. You may need to increase scene buffering time to do this but it should be fine."
Twitch,3csv32,UltimaN3rd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:36:49 2015 UTC,"I had this same issue. It took me a few hours to figure it out. It takes some fumbling, and it'll be different for every person, but I can give you the places to look, and adjust.  If the audio and video from the elgato are out of sync go to your sources panel, right click on the source (probably a global source), and go to Properties. On the right side you'll see ""Audio Input Device:"". In that section make sure ""Output audio to stream only"" is checked off. Here is the interesting part, my game audio was ahead of my game video, so I set the ""Audio Sync Offset"" to -1500. You'll have to adjust that to whatever your situation is.  Now, I had trouble with my webcam being behind my game, so I went in to my webcam properties (also a global source), and on the left side under ""Video"" category I checked ""Use Buffering"", and set that to 1500.  These worked for me, and like I said, you'll have to adjust to your own situation. I would just make sure you're streaming, watch your stream on twitch, and do a sort of checking system. I simply went in to my game and just made the character jump, then started saying jump to line up the audio of my mic with the audio of the game, and then tilted my head sideways to make sure the camera was in sync.

Twitch,3cs80k,alekxandar,2,Fri Jul 10 14:21:58 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest Blue Microphones like the Blue Yeti or Snowball.  Also how does the music interfere with the mic built into the computer? Unless you're playing it out loud, then usually even a good microphone won't help."
Twitch,3cs80k,Upstagebuffalo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:26:52 2015 UTC,It is being played out on the computer I wouldn't say loud as my headset don't pick it up but it is loud enough for the mic in the computer to pick it up.    I thought this would just be causing problems for people in stream.  Do you have a better way to stream music ?? I currently just use Moobot ..
Twitch,3cs80k,Upstagebuffalo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:47:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty confused on what you're asking... but if you want to play music play it through your headset and not your speakers, then you don't have to worry about your mic picking it up. Also a good mic like Blue Snowball or Yeti would pick up the music much more than the mic in your computer."

I'm only posting because I recently got a Blue Snowball for $44.99 at Best But (about half off) and the sound quality is pretty great for a beginning streamer like myself.   Prior to this I used the mic on my Steelseries Siberia V2, which was very low, and not great honestly.   I know it's tempting to want to get better mics, like the Blue Yeti, AT2020, etc. But if you are strapped on money, I suggest the Snowball. If you want to know the quality, check out of one my recent videos just to hear how it sounds. DO keep in mind that you have to be relatively close when speaking. I would say from about 6-12 inches. Any farther and you will sound very distant :(   I hope you find the mic for you!"

Twitch,3cukrq,Pilebum,3,Fri Jul 10 22:11:57 2015 UTC,I have no idea if they are doing it for the tax breaks but I'm sure part of the reason they do it is for the publicity.  Not saying they don't care at all about the charity they are raising money for.
Twitch,3cukrq,justmeandmyself10,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:47:54 2015 UTC,Im thinking this too. I can imagine the donations streams do drive in views. One of my new fav streamers I found via his charity stream. This makes total sense too.
Twitch,3cukrq,9Blu,2,Fri Jul 10 22:49:01 2015 UTC,"What tax break? In the US charitable contributions come off your taxable income, not your taxes owed.  It's a zero-sum situation. Say I make $100K, and my tax rate is 10% (I wish).  So I owe $10K in taxes.  If I make a $10K contribution to charity, it reduced my taxable income to $90K and my taxes will be $9K, not $0.   Now if they are not reporting the income, then yes, they would benefit but for a large donation amount it would be hard to get away with.  In the US donating a large percentage of your income (legitimately or not) is something that will usually trigger an audit. If you tried to zero out all of your income with one, you would be all but guaranteed a visit from Uncle Sam.   Not sure how it works in other parts of the world but I'd imagine it would be similar."
Twitch,3cukrq,i_make_doors,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:18:45 2015 UTC,As far as I know all the processing is done on the side of the charity and he streamer is only there to raise awareness and won't get any tax benefits aside from any donations they make on their own behalf. The person making the donation will receive the appropriate receipt for their own tax purposes.
Twitch,3cukrq,i_make_doors,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:14:06 2015 UTC,"But from what I gathered and what a major streamer said earlier in the week. The money is often donated into their personal/paypal account, and they donate it to the organization. In their name or their LLC's name."
Twitch,3cukrq,Skobee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"None of the ones I have seen are like that, St Jude's for example has pages setup for individuals and for teams where a donation is done completely through St Jude's page and the streamer would never have control of the money."

Twitch,3cse38,DanishTechhead,2,Fri Jul 10 11:47:04 2015 UTC,"Ok so I set up quicksync.  Turns out that I had my Intel HD Graphics disabled in the BIOS.  I enabled that, set my 780Ti to the primary display and booted.  Now I still have plenty of frames, and since the HD Graphics are rendering the stream, things are MUCH better.  I would say that things are nearly back to where they should be with a small drop in the graphics settings.  It is still just a tad more smooth feeling when I am not streaming but it's not really a big deal at all."

We've met countless, awesome people through our experience through Twitch. Our viewers, other streamers, and beyond.

Twitch,3cs60h,Namits00,3,Fri Jul 10 09:50:20 2015 UTC,"Copy pastasing a post I wrote a few months ago about this topic - I think you will find it interesting.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/2rjtym/an_honest_and_optimistic_discussion_about_channel/?sort=top  If you have spent any time here on /r/Twitch then you've seen many, many posts asking the question, ""is my channel growth good?"" then the OP proceeds to detail how long they have been streaming and what their current follow and concurrent viewers counts are.  The common thread in all these threads is the general response is that there is no general response to these kinds of question. I firmly believe that everyone's stream will grow at vastly different rates for vastly different reasons. Time slots, games chosen, networking, luck are just a few of the factors that will come into play when trying to parse out the growth of any single individual channel.  So what's the point of this post, you ask? This isn't a reinforcement of the ideas above, but more so my thoughts on a kind of ""goal"" all streamers can aim for when it comes to any form of ""expected"" growth.   It all breaks down to converting one true fan a week.  For anyone familiar with the 1,000 True Fan Theory (Found here) this might ring a bell. At its core the 1,000 True Fan theory states that an artistic endeavor can be supported if there are at the very least 1,000 people who are life-long fans.   Obviously the validity of the 1,000 True Fan Theory can be disputed, and the author agrees, but I believe there is some basis for it and the pursuit of those ""1,000 Tue Fans"" led me to a realization about stream growth that put all my efforts into perspective.  You'll get to a point  when you realize how ""worthless"" the follower count truly is. Don't get me wrong, having a high follower count most certainly has its perks, but overall it does very little to serve as a gauge of how you are doing as a streamer. Our stream has almost 15k followers, but at best we'll get viewer counts ranging from 120-250 (game depending).  That means we are getting a little over 1% of our follower count in terms of concurrent viewers. What I would give for  a consistent 2% or dare I even dream, 3%. From what I've seen of streamers of similar size - this is a common ratio. It's because a follow is the easiest thing a Twitch viewer can ""give"" to a streamer. There is no consequence to a viewer throwing a follow to a stream they will never go to again, even more so if the account was made for a giveaway; if you are a streamer that advertises frequent giveaways expect an even greater threshold between follows and concurrent viewers.  The overall point of above is to emphasize that your focus should always be on the viewers you have in your stream right now and not the top end viewer count you could theoretically get if every single person who ever followed you were to just come back (it's never going to happen).  This is why as a streamer I focus on converting viewers into True Fans and from what I've seen if you can convert one True Fan a week then you have a shot at making it as a streamer.  That said, keep in mind this isn't a get famous quick strategy. There are 52 weeks in a year and if you manage in one year of streaming to convert a true fan a week then you have 52 viewers who will stick with you. In terms of ""making it"" as a streamer you are still way off in terms of financial stability. As others have mentioned on the subreddit - streaming isn't a sprint it's a marathon. You have to be in it for the long haul - because you love it.  52 True Fans in one year is, I feel, a very conservative estimate. And keep in mind your first year will be difficult since the lower amount of exposure you have the harder it is to convert people. You might go a few weeks where you don't convert anyone, and then you might hit a week where you convert tens of people. As is with TwitchTV, growth is exponential and things come easier the more people are present in your stream. Keep them around and start to disregard your follower count entirely.  Let's take our stream for example, OverBored Gaming. Come February 25th we'll have been streaming for 2 years. I imagine our follower count might be around 15,500 then and our common concurrent viewer counts will still be around 120-250 (I was 100% correct in my prediction!). We've had the opportunity to convert 104 true fans in the past 2 years of streaming, and by going subs and concurrent viewers I feel we're more or less on track with my estimates.   Don't get me wrong - it's hard work to impress another human being enough to want to spend their time with you everyday, especially people as discriminating in tastes as internet users. But it's possible - it really is.   I just wanted to provide some semblance of metrics for you to follow, something to help you feel like you aren't totally in the dark when it comes to trying to measure if your growth is ""good.""  What I'm trying to say is your growth doesn't suck quite as much as you think it does :)"
Twitch,3cs60h,Brawli55,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:48:28 2015 UTC,"I think this is a fantastic approach not only to streaming, but growing a fan base in general.   Communities live and die on the true fans, if it's 10, 100, or 1000. Do your best to make viewers into true fans and you're likely on to something."

Twitch,3cs60h,ZinniePlays,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:41:24 2015 UTC,"The advice I always give (and I'm sure you've heard this before) is to avoid the top 10 games on twitch. When you moved away from Diablo III (which is pretty popular itself), you jumped into WoW, LoL, and Hearthstone, which are all so saturated that the chances of you being discovered with a single-digit viewership are almost nil. Until you consistently start hitting at least double digits, I'd recommend moving to a game less traveled. Pick a game you're going to enjoy playing, that you can run on your hardware, and that isn't in the top 10-20 games on Twitch, and see how that goes for a handful of streams."

Twitch,3cpflv,PensiveLionTurtle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:08:28 2015 UTC,Possibly a dumb question regarding registered email. Is there some way to procure a Twitch account without registering with an email address? Why is this option even an option?
Twitch,3cpflv,Brawli55,3,Thu Jul 9 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"I imagine it's because requiring a registered email would be a point of failure when getting someone to adopt Twitch as an entertainment medium.   Imagine trying to shop on a website that doesn't have a guest user option for checkout; there are a lot of people who will see that email requirement to checkout and say, ""eh, screw it"" and go to another site. Twitch wants people to use Twitch and to chat, so putting up as few barriers as possible to necessitate that is probably the reason registered emails aren't a default thing."
Twitch,3cpflv,g33z3r_hd,2,Thu Jul 9 21:59:39 2015 UTC,"It's about verifying your email.  This proves that your email address is real and that you are more likely a real person than a bot or a troll because you gave a REAL email address.  Every Twitch account requires an email...but it doesn't have to be ""real"" per se."
Twitch,3cpflv,justmeandmyself10,3,Thu Jul 9 22:04:03 2015 UTC,"I actually quit streaming because of the trolls. I know that's like ""letting them win"" but once it started to not be fun anymore I didn't see any point in continuing.  It wasn't so much people were harassing me, I would have someone come in and act and chat fine then suddenly they just start cussing and yelling at someone and by the time I realize what's going on and ban them they have already managed to chase away 2 or 3 viewers. This happened during one stream and I figured it was just a fluke so I banned the person and kept going on but when it happened again the very next night, by someone who had been a follower for a few days (so it most likely wasn't just the same person on another account) that's when I said okay, enough of this.   Not saying you should give up if you're still having fun, just saying you should be prepared for this type of stuff because it's bound to keep happening.  And like others have said the verified email thing helps a lot but there are still some determined trolls out there that have multiple accounts."

Super dumb, anyway, LFG.com only keeps ads posted for 5 minutes.  Unless my viewers are having a normal conversation with me, talking about what I'm doing or whatever, I largely ignore chat."

Twitch,3cpflv,InputOutsourced,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:40:52 2015 UTC,I was streaming rocket league today and was getting a lot of banner spam.  It never happens if I stream a smaller game for some reason.
Twitch,3cpflv,TheSkuggi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"Viewers of popular games (LoL, Hearthstone, CS:GO, etc.) have a zerg-like mentality. They're all about the memes and the trolling. If you're popular in one of those games, it's likely that your chat will be full of spam."
Twitch,3cpflv,FanaticDreamer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:10:02 2015 UTC,"From what i have learned throughout my experiences of twitch. The more popular the game, it usually means the more trolls. There are some less popular games that also attract harassers. I would recommend finding people that you find trustworthy mod for you. whenever people harass, don't be afraid to timeout, ban or even report when needed."
Twitch,3cs1ci,thunderous_pr0phet,3,Fri Jul 10 08:41:38 2015 UTC,To get the best quality from a PS4 you'll need a capture card. Capturing the gameplay to a PC then streaming with OBS is your best option - though livestreaming still has its limits. If you really want the best possible quality you'd need to record videos for YouTube or something like that.
Twitch,3cs1ci,UltimaN3rd,2,Fri Jul 10 11:22:47 2015 UTC,The quality that you are getting is probably about as good as you are going to get without an external capture card. You may be able to get a little more out of your quality by upgrading you upload speed with you ISP if possible. My advice is if you want to really get into streaming is to consider an external capture setup.
Twitch,3cs1ci,TalonJH,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:42:17 2015 UTC,That is something I am considering. I wanted to stream some ps3 games.  Any particular hardware youd reccomend?   Thanks.
Twitch,3cs1ci,TalonJH,2,Fri Jul 10 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer Avermedia's Live Gamer HD. It's a PCI card as apposed to a USB connected device. I feel like it puts less strain on my PC, giving me more headroom to make adjustments to my stream and it's quality. They also have USB devices that are more convenient and similar to the Elgato which is probably the most popular but just not my fav. You really shouldn't have to pay over $200 for your capture card. You can even find a used capture card on eBay or Craigslist."
Twitch,3cs1ci,TalonJH,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:55:02 2015 UTC,Does that mean id have to open up my pc to use it?  I have a decent rig but I haven't messed with its insides since I got it about three years ago.  Im due for a new graphics card but messing with its innards makes me nervous.
Twitch,3cs1ci,ZinniePlays,2,Fri Jul 10 21:12:33 2015 UTC,"Yes but it so easy that you can do it in your sleep. No extra power wire, just plugs directly into the board and close her back up."
Twitch,3crx7w,Dreadmyst06,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:41:32 2015 UTC,"I don't see there being any issue; just as long as there is no footage displayed. That's considered copyrighted property and you'd be in a bit of trouble for it.  That said, the topic of anime is fine as many gamers are also anime fans; but you do need to think about exposure. If you think you'll get better exposure on YT, then go for it there. If you feel like Twitch is better exposure, then go for it on Twitch.  Personally, as someone who did 102 shows of a gaming podcast on Twitch, I didn't really have much success. The episodes got uploaded to YT and don't have a whole lot of views. I have since moved to a Kerbal Space Program podcast that is getting quite popular; but that is more due to the tight-knit community surrounding that game.  It's a matter of navigating the options and working out what is right for you. So straight out of the gate, I would say that you should pop it up on both mediums (live on twitch, offline on YT/iTunes) and re-evaluate when you hit about Episode 5. Then again at Ep 10. By that point you should know what is best for you."
Twitch,3crx7w,sir_afrodite,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:53:11 2015 UTC,"Just to add, depending on the nature of the show and commentary, OP might be able to show some anime footage under ""Fair use"" clauses of copyright law. Worth him/her doing a quick Google to see how it applies."

Just so you know, the // at the beginning of the links is very likely intentional, because that tells the browser to choose http:// or https:// depending on current connection. The browser plugin probably doesn't support that, hence the images aren't loading. Explicitly adding http fixes that."

Twitch,3cn5tg,MattPeddlesden,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:56:09 2015 UTC,"Looks like you can indeed change the bitrate midstream, but you can't change resolution or framerate... so it's partially useful at least."

Twitch,3cn5tg,MadCactus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:33:02 2015 UTC,"It's not possible to change resolution mid-stream.  The H.264 codec technically supports changing mid-stream resolution, but most decoders (in terms of video player applications) do not support it at all, and I'm guessing that transcoders like twitch's and youtube's transcoder very likely do not support that functionality.  Changing FPS mid-stream is also tecnically possible if you use variable framerate, but that also has limited support by most decoders, not to mention also breaks twitch's transcoders last I recall (though I could be wrong).  It's just not worth it for the development time it would take to implement those two things."
Twitch,3cn5tg,MadCactus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"We've pretty much always had the ability to change the bitrate mid-stream.  (Would probably be nice if it did it automatically when dropping frames too, it's something on our todo list)"

Twitch,3cn5tg,kcmartz,2,Thu Jul 9 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a possibility. One issue with the browser plugin is that it alone is as big or bigger than OBS itself, which is a lot of data for a feature not everyone uses. But on the other hand, it is a feature that a lot of people do use, so it might be worth bundling for the sake of convenience."
Twitch,3cn5tg,jamacanbacn,2,Thu Jul 9 14:23:11 2015 UTC,"Or two downloads, one with the plugin one without?"

Twitch,3cn5tg,highstyled,2,Thu Jul 9 20:03:31 2015 UTC,"So on OBS v0.651b im able to stream at 1500 bitrate/buffer with minimal ping impact but when i use this release of OBS MP I'm getting pretty intense ping spikes even when lowering my settings down to 1000 bitrate/buffer. I'm using the exact same game/hosting server/settings when trying both versions of OBS but only running in to the problem with MP. Any help would be awesome.  edit: Outside of that I am seeing a noticeable increase in quality of the stream with the same settings and a consistent slight cpu useage decrease which is absolutely amazing which is absolutely awesome. edit2: so the issue seems to be the minimize network impact option. If i unselect it in my current obs i get the same problem that im having with MP but once i check it the issue resolves. Is there an option currently in MP that im overlooking and if not, will it be implemented? Thanks for reading this."

Is there way to use a different crop for two of the same source (e.g. If I add my webcam in two different scenes, I want one to crop just my face, and the other to show my whole body)? You could do this by pressing alt in the original OBS.    Also, is there a list of known issues so that we (and by we, I mean I) don't go and unnecessarily post about things you already know don't work?"

Elgato devices cannot be added directly to OBS on Mac. This is a shortcoming of Elgato drivers and there's nothing we can do about it until Elgato release AVCapture drivers. As mentioned in the OP, there's an issue when applying audio filtersd (noise gate and gain) to webcam/capture card audio where it makes the video disappear GIFs only work if you add them via the Media source, not the image source   Those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head...It's generally not a huge deal if you repeat someone though.

I thought I had read somewhere that this had been fixed but I see in the OP that this isn't the case. I wish I could use OBS but I am stuck using Xsplit and I am having frame rate issues. Does anyone know of any workarounds/fixes for the colossus. I know the capture card is now pretty out-dated but its all I have and would love it to work.
Twitch,3cn5tg,Osiris-,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:35:43 2015 UTC,"The colossus probably won't work yet.  We sort of have to implement each device that uses encoded feed like that, it's a slight pain."

The entire emphasis of the program is still performance, even in the new version."

I'll try the same on MP and see if it's lower for me!  UPDATE: Tried it out, still need to monitor usage numbers, but as a program I LOVE IT. It feels very refined and pretty.

I have 2 of these cards in my streaming machine (1 for game cap and 1 for camera) and I am super happy with them because, mainly, they do exactly what I need.  I have used the ElGato, I have used the Haupauge (however you spell it), I have used Roxio, and now I use the AverMedia.  Each and every one of them has their upsides and their downsides.

Twitch,3cnfl9,justmeandmyself10,30,Thu Jul 9 07:00:48 2015 UTC,"How does Twitch still boast 1.5 million unique streamers? There must be a constant flux of people thinking they are going to become rich/""just have fun"" to replace all of the streamers who have finally figured out it's not gonna happen.   And those that can hack it will be the ones to reap the rewards  of their perseverance; as it is often said on this subreddit - streaming isn't a sprint, it's a marathon.  But yea, overall you are right - most of the people you see stream, those that post here and those that don't even know this sub exist will not make it. It's not for a lack of trying - there is a market for this kind of media and everyone can find their niche - the trouble is having an end game goal for when all you can see is highway in front of you.   For some, the 5th time their growth plateaus is enough to call it a quits; for others' it's the first. The barrier to entry is low, so it doesn't surprise me there have been over a million unique broadcasters on Twitch. Only a handful made enough impact to be remembered by a few viewers on Twitch, even fewer still will make a living from this whole thing.  I look at my experience with Twitch as my way of leaving a mark on this world - it's my slice of recognized reality that is undeniably mine. Our stream has been blessed with a margin of traffic that'd I'd consider ""good"" but it's not nearly enough to live off of and that's fine. Streaming is my passion, and unlike so many others, I don't see myself chasing my passion until I'm consumed by it and burn out. Apply dedication to perseverance then add time.   You need to have a game plan to keep your self afloat while chasing your dreams. Nothing is impossible, but you make it highly improbable when you try to be only buoyed by your dreams; live to stream, don't stream to live."

I do it for fun and because it's great to interact with others while playing a game and maybe making someone's day better. I find it's also a release for me. Not only through playing games, but simply through interacting with others.  But back onto the note of your bold statement. I think too many people get into it thinking ""I'm gonna make a living here"" and then drop job searches and reasonable things.  I always get scared seeing a 'full time' streamer with sub 10 or 20 viewers max. I get sad (which it might be wrong for me to do so, but I can't help it).

Obviously someone like Lirik has to be making thousands of dollars a month, just watching his stream for a few minutes you can see him receiving donations and people subbing for many months in a row, this isn't even counting his partnerships or YouTube videos making money or anything.  Maybe someone can stream full time and make 1200 dollars a month and they're happy with that, to them that's ""making a living"" and that's perfectly fine. Not everyone needs to make 10k a month to be happy.  I wonder how though how many people consider themselves ""making a living"" from streaming and they're earning about what minimum wage would pay anyways.

I would also say the quality of streams are improving as a whole and it's a mad arms race to have a better setup and more quality stream. I am ok with that for sure, but I imagine 75% of those 1.5 million don't have the setup or the passion to grind that most the ones that made it have.   I recently watched a video of Cohh back on a talk show about making it streaming over a year ago and the first thing he said was it was the hardest job he has ever had.  He was not even half the success then as he is now.    The ones that make it will work their asses off improving and streaming."

Beyond that there is no plan beyond turning on that computer to stream.   And that's fine, but it's getting to a point where a very small fraction of those streams will ever get noticed, let alone streams where people put effort into them getting noticed ... you have to be in it for the long haul."

Just because it's really unlikely doesn't stop people from trying.  That said, there's a level of accessibility with streaming that's absent in some of these other alternative career paths. Most people accept that there's a lot of groundwork for the, uh, ""traditional alternative"" careers--training, classes, etc. Any schmuck with a computer and internet connection--like me!--can stream, which makes success via streaming seem more possible, as opposed to a musician (relies on bandmates/manager/venues) or an actor (relies on director/casting agencies).  What many hopefuls don't realize, though, is that becoming successful at streaming is like all of these other careers in that it requires training and building up a foundation of skills, connections, and a fan base. Newbies look at big-name streamers and feel like anyone could do it--just like American Idol proved everyone thought they could sing--without realizing the painstaking, backbreaking work that goes into streaming professionally."
Twitch,3cnfl9,Brawli55,2,Thu Jul 9 08:17:23 2015 UTC,"I think every TwitchTV channel more or less starts with the streamer hopeful seeing a TwitchTV stream and saying, ""I can do that!""  I know that's how we got started, haha."
Twitch,3cnfl9,adwcta,3,Thu Jul 9 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"I think the OP's point is that the realistic scaling of how ""trying hard"" and ""being good"" at what you do and how it affects the odds of anyone ""making it"" ultimately has a limited effect when compared to the astronomical starting odds you face.  For example, if ""hard work"" and ""smart marketing"" makes you 100x more attractive than the average guy starting a stream... but the odds of that average guy starting a stream and ""making it"" is 1:100,000 (not an unreasonable estimate)... you will still only have a 0.1% chance of ""making it"".  This is after factoring in all of your efforts and intelligence and skill when compared with your peers.  So, while these sentiments are true, and they do significantly help your odds. . . the starting point is so low, that you're basically at the same level as someone trying out for American Idol making it in the music industry.  A couple people ""really make it"" every year, about a dozen more can support themselves at near-poverty level doing what they love, and the rest will absolutely have to have a second source of significant income to eat food and live under roof.  Talent, hard work, all of that factored in."
Twitch,3cnfl9,Chilblain,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"Wrong.  To be an artist or a musician or an athlete you have to have talent.  Physical prowess, natural ability, a good ear... and those who don't are weeded out in grade school because they get beaten out for a spot on the team, or nobody wants to listen to their music, or they realize that chalk drawings on the sidewalk doesn't pay the bills.  With streaming the barrier for entry is almost non-existent.  Everyone already has a PC, probably has a headset with a mic, and the streaming software is free.  Is costs almost nothing to do it, which is why so many people want to, and start to be streamers.  It's not fair to compare the two."
Twitch,3cnfl9,Derelium,2,Thu Jul 9 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"lol ok, they're literally the exact same thing, but what ever works for you. Anyone can take an art class, anyone can audition for a play, anyone can pick up a tambourine, and anyone with a computer can stream. Trying to get ""noticed"" in any medium of entertainment is the same exact concept, no matter what medium of entertainment it is. Becoming a streamer, actor, artist, musician, athlete, writer, etc etc is the exact same process. Work hard, get good, get noticed, period. Success is not complex, it's just easier said than done."
Twitch,3cnfl9,StrykerNoStriking,10,Thu Jul 9 23:35:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to be combative but some of these comments confuse me.  I think a lot of people do give up in just a short week or even a month because it's not the instant success they thought it was going to be, but I also think a lot of people give it a good few months and come to the realization that it's just not going to happen. Not because they're quitters or can't handle it, but because it's the truth. There is absolutely no guarantee that putting in more hours is going to make one successful or even guarantee that they are even going to get another 100 viewers/followers.  I agree about getting paid to do something you love and I don't blame people one bit for wanting to make a living playing video games, who the heck wouldn't? I was just commenting on the people who for some reason try to hide the fact that they are mostly doing it for money by claiming they are doing it to have fun then end up quitting shortly afterward.  I think another thing that gets people's hopes up is thinking there is some sort of magic button they can push to become a success. The advice is usually ""get your name out there"" via YouTube or Twitter or something. I've seen streams with less than 100 views with both YouTube and Twitter accounts that are equally empty. When everyone is doing the exact same thing you are to get noticed it's unlikely to help you stand out from the crowd.  The more recent advice seems to be to join a stream group but that's the same problem, everyone seems to be in a group these days.  Don't get me wrong, this is all good advice and I'm not knocking it, it just seems to be more wishful thinking for a lot of people out there, the people who think there is some sort of magic formula for success when in reality it's mostly about luck these days. I know a lot of people are going to wag their fingers at me for saying it's mostly about luck but let's be honest, it is. There are probably thousands, maybe even tens of thousands of really good LoL players out there yet only about 50 or so LoL streamers have any sort of real following at any given time on Twitch."
Twitch,3cnfl9,Tover787,3,Fri Jul 10 01:50:16 2015 UTC,"I was just commenting on the people who for some reason try to hide the fact that they are mostly doing it for money by claiming they are doing it to have fun then end up quitting shortly afterward.   I think more people do it for the attention--the satisfaction of having an audience, y'know? And then, when the audience doesn't magically appear (or doesn't interact), it makes them discouraged.    it just seems to be more wishful thinking for a lot of people out there   True.   the people who think there is some sort of magic formula for success when in reality it's mostly about luck these days   And here is where I'm going to disagree with you.  There's doing what everyone's been doing--and there's doing what everyone's been doing well. My day job is to do something that's really effing common in the industry: Writing blogs for my company to provide content to customers. They grow to know and trust us through the (free) blogs, to the point where they'll start to investigate our paid resources and workshops. (Basically. More to it than that, but you get the point.)  But my blog works where others fail because I actively work to put out the best content I can, and take feedback/tweak when something doesn't do well. No, I'm a far sight off from giants like Hubspot or CMI--they've got some great blogs!--but because I take the time to do what everyone else is doing well and to invest time, training, and resources into upping my game (excuse the pun), the blog succeeds and I'm paid salary to write free shit.  The same concept is here. Is luck a factor? Absolutely. Is it the determining factor? For most, no. The goal to creating a good stream--one that attracts followers and viewers alike--is to look at what everyone else is doing, and see the overarching patterns. From there, you need to get critical, knowledgeable, third-party opinions to look at your stream and give you feedback. You can think you're good, and you can study your ass off, but you can't truly grade your own work effectively. (That's why my posts run through editor after editor before they go public.)  So yes, most people won't be great--but that's due to both a limited ""number"" of slots available for great streamers (we as viewers can only pay attention to so many people at once, after all) and a limited percentage of streamers who can:   Study and learn about what makes a great stream; Ask for feedback from critical, knowledgeable people--and then act on it without egos getting in the way; and Dedicate the raw time necessary to build up a stream into something remarkable.   I'm lacking that last bullet, unfortunately, and some of the ""essential"" bits that most good streamers have. (A decent YouTube channel, for one.) But I'm not blaming my lack of viewers or followers on luck. That, to me, reeks of sour grapes.  It's like people who constantly blame their poor Hearthstone performance on RNG. Yes, it'll bite you sometimes, but it's lack of skill at the game that keeps you at level 15, not what cards you have or what RNGesus has in store for you."

My question would be where would one go to find that knowledgeable third party analysis? Sure you can have friends look at your stream and past videos, but generally they are not a good knowledgeable source (or at least not in my case). I definitely agree with the rest of your comment though."
Twitch,3cnfl9,Statuemantv,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:28:01 2015 UTC,"That's tricky. I'd say the best third party opinions are found from fellow streamers you establish close enough relationships with to have them tell you both the good and the bad. (U/nestledrinktv does that for me sometimes.) Plus, if you ask your regular viewers why they watch, they'll tell you the bits of your stream that are exceptional.  Though yeah--that's probably the hardest bit of this whole thing."
Twitch,3cnfl9,HammerIsMyName,5,Thu Jul 9 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"Its just about mindset, back in the day there wasn't anywhere near the amount of money involved in streaming that there is now nor such a big pool of potential viewers so if you streamed back in the day you did it because you literally loved it and had a passion for it, now the majority of streamers are in it for a quick buck and i think it kills production quality, people are constantly fixated on viewer/follower count and donations and they forget to be entertaining, i have seen multiple new streamers with absolutely no effort put into their stream but they made sure to add a donation button, it hurts my brain thinking about it.  I think streaming on twitch and any other platform on the internet is a very viable career path, its still relatively new and with tv streaming places like netflix and such popping up and people are always on the go its becoming way more mainstream as people just don't have the time or patience to sit down at a certain time on a certain day to get their fill of entertainment, now we are all on the go and always connected to the internet we can get are fill online at anytime via streaming services and sites like twitch, i literally haven't properly watched my TV in 6-12 months, all my TV is watched online when it suits me and everything else is twitch/youtube + gaming.  I think the problem with twitch being over saturated with bad streamers is like i said ""mindset"" so many people come in thinking they are going to make big money and forget to be entertaining or to actually put effort into their stream like graphics/overlays/information having good internet so you can have a good quality stream, being happy and positive, using a mic and cam etc.  As for pushing viewers towards the bigger streams and not new non partnered streams, thats just business, people like MvG and Lirik generate lots of traffic and money for the site, it would make no sense to push people towards new streamers with no following for no return, twitch already provides a platform where you can stream to the masses, its up to the streamer to put on an entertaining stream and get himself or herself out there and network with people and other streamers and generate a viewership"
Twitch,3cnfl9,DamnNoHtml,2,Thu Jul 9 22:35:15 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of good points but I have to disagree about streaming being a viable career path. Yes, one can make a lot of money doing it, but it seems like for the amount of time, effort, and yes even money required it probably ranks near the bottom in terms of chances of actually making a decent living.  Twitch themselves says they have 10,000 partners, even assuming all of them made a living doing it, and figure another 10,000 made a living just from donations and Patreon or whatnot, that's less than 1.5% of the people streaming on Twitch make a living doing it. And that's a very liberal estimate.  But I do agree that I think people with the mindset of ""I'm gonna do this to get rich"" are probably why it's so over saturated right now and the actual good streamers are probably getting lost in a sea of crash grabbers."
Twitch,3cnfl9,DamnNoHtml,2,Thu Jul 9 07:44:42 2015 UTC,"I'm partnered, ranking about 2600th in follower count, averaging 150-350 viewers every stream. I can tell you based on my numbers, and how close I am to make a living from streaming, that probably less than 25% of partnered streamers make a living streaming. The majority probably struggling to actually pay rent.  Though my view count is good, my subscriber count is pretty low for a channel my size, so that might skew my perspective."
Twitch,3cnfl9,HammerIsMyName,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:02:03 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, how are you close to making a living with those numbers? Want to make sure I'm not doing something wrong here."

Twitch,3cnfl9,drewlinskii,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:10:40 2015 UTC,I live in a very cheap apartment and have very few expenses - Combining sub money and patreon almost covers my rent - tips would then have to cover everything else.  I do manage to actually make a living streaming full time by selling the stuff I make on stream and I have another job that covers my rent but takes almost no time at all - But that's a pretty unique circumstance that doesn't apply to many other streamers though.
Twitch,3cnfl9,AvalonAngel84,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"Ah alright I gotcha. I just know that if you had maybe 100 subs, that's only $250 a month, with maybe an extra $100 from ad revenue, then $120 a month from Patreon. You can pay for an apartment, electric, internet, water, food, phone bill, car(?) bill + insurance on ~$470 a month? (This of course includes random tips but that's hardly consistent enough to justify saying you make a living off of it)  I can't even find an apartment for that price, much less the multitude of other expenses needed to live :| That's cool you are finding success but I think people on average would have more expenses than you."

Twitch,3cnfl9,OnOrAroundTheCoats,6,Thu Jul 9 20:48:25 2015 UTC,"Someone made a comment in this thread likening streaming to being a musician and I think that's bang on.  As a streamer you're being creative and creatives need to do it because they love it.  If you love what you do, then you just get on with it because it's rewarding in its own right.  The best streamers obviously love what they're doing too, they're playing games they enjoy, they're enjoying showing them off, and they're having a great time interacting with the audience - those streamers don't care if they succeed, and out of any, they're probably (but absolutely not guaranteed) to be the most likely TO succeed because they're simply more fun to watch.  For me, I realised that since I started working for the company that makes Train Simulator, I had basically all but stopped playing it for fun because I was doing development and testing for it all day at work.  In some ways that's great because you need to switch off and do something else when you get home - but in my role as a game designer I actually need to be much more in touch with what people are doing with it, what they want and so forth.  I decided to start playing the game every night, and at the same time I wanted to have a look at Twitch streaming to understand it better - seemed like the I could make the two work together.  If the Twitch bit didn't work, or dies off, then that's no problem, because i'm still enjoying playing the game, and having a regular twitch stream is giving me a ""booked slot"" to actually get down and play it otherwise I might end up not getting around to it some nights or getting distracted by the latest shiny on Steam :)  If you don't enjoy it, or you're constantly looking at viewers thinking ""is it worth it?"" then you ought to re-evaluate why you're doing it - IMHO.  Making money off of streaming is really really difficult, most people will fail to do that - so don't try, if it happens, it'll happen, so focus on enjoying the hobby and playing great games :)  I've also now got in touch with and become friends with a few really great people through the stream - that's worth more to me in many ways!  I still stream 4 days a week for 3-4 hours a night (used to be 5, realised I was a zombie at work :) ), people come back regularly (over 1500 followers now and about 35k views) and i'm building up followings across other forms of social media too.  I've certainly not done this to make money (very happy with my day job thanks!) - but I'm delighted with the group of people that are getting together and everyone's getting more out of the game as a result (including me :) ).  For me, Twitch itself is the hobby :)"
Twitch,3cnfl9,Sportsfan723,3,Thu Jul 9 21:00:03 2015 UTC,"This is a very broad topic. Saying one thing can lead to another and cause an almost never ending chain reaction of different scenarios, so this is a great question and topic that can lead to an excelent discussion. (imo at least)  Let's me just start by saying this; There are different types of streamers: Entertainers, Pro Gamers, Speed Runners, 'Cam Girls' (hate to say it, but it's true. At least they are a whole other genre on Twitch that doesn't involve all the other streamers), then there's the newer streamers that don't know what kind of streamer they are, and then there's the streamers that stricktly do it to try and get money and they then realize that it's hard as fuck to even get your name out there (w/o viewbotting and working hard) so they just give up, which leads me to this...  Making a name for yourself/building a community: It is hard as hell to do, especially with no previous following, such as YouTube or maybe some sort of Social Media prescence i.e. Twitter, Instagram. This alone can take months to do, and for some people even years. It's very easy to give up, especially after spending hundreds of hours streaming and having fun with no obvious signs of growth. Some days are better than others, some days are average, and somedays no one will show up. It's weird how inconsistent views can be, which will lead me to something about followers. Hate to say it, but followers really don't matter at all to a streamer. I mean, it's literally the easiest thing to do on Twitch. All you have to do it touch or click on the Purple <3 and that's it. The Viewers are what really count. Wheather they are interacting or not, The Viewers are what will help get your name out there. (it's a requirement for getting a partnership). I'll use my channel as an example (hopefully that doesn't come out to be arrogant). 1000 followers and about 10-15 average viewers. Theres a possibiltiy for 1000+ people to be viewing my stream, but not EVERYONE that's following will watch for obvious reasons. And then some people will come into my channel saying that they never got a notification that I went live, which can be pretty dissapointing to hear mainly because it makes me wonder how many other followers DON'T get that notification, that would actually come and stop by my channel.    most people who say they're doing it ""for fun"" seem to really want to make a living doing it.   Isn't that how every occupation is? Just look at the Music Industry. There's people all over the world that would love to live their life on the road, making music, and performing in front of a crowd. I've known of people that would travel accross the country, NY to LA, and pretty much have nowhere to stay just because they want to make a name for themselves, and what better way than going to Hollywood. That right there is real passion and dedication. It's a little different with Streaming being an Internet career, but Passion and Dedication is the main driving force for someone to want to continue doing it and make a name for themselves.    It's kind of sad. I check out a lot of low view channels and you can tell people are really trying (some of them anyways) but it must be frustrating for them to sit there hour after hour, day after day, mostly talking to themselves.   Sure it can get to us streamers sometimes, but when it doesn, It's usually because we aren't in the right mindset that day. It's just a bad day. We usually watch a big streamer and aspire to be as big or even bigger than that streamer, when in reality, it took that specific streamer months or even years to get to where they are now. It's very hard to actually see from the outside-in, because what we usually see when someone has a high viewcount while getting 10 subs every hour and getting $5, $10, $25, 100$ in every hour, is that they are happy and having a shit ton of fun because they get to play video games and share that experience with us, The Viewers, and knowing that they didn't give up years or months ago.   It takes a special someone, and maybe even a bit of luck to make it. I've seen posts about people have been streaming since JTV and they haven't really gotten anywhere, which is really dissapointing to hear. So what are they doing wrong? I honestly don't know... I wish they could give us more information so I can better understand what they are doing wrong. Just like the music industry and pretty much every competitive occupation out there, not everyone is built to succeed at everything they do, they can only try and not give up."
Twitch,3cnfl9,rallei_lol,2,Thu Jul 9 09:39:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah people keep saying: ""Just keep going and viewers will come..."". This is true but ALSO you have to keep working on your stream and yourself. So after a particular bad day or week or whatever, ask yourself what went wrong and then try to work on that issue!  i've been streaming since October '14 and I'm nearly at a 1000 followers as well... Viewership goes from 10 to 50 depending on the day and the game, BUT more and more people keep showing up despite the game I'm playing. And that's great because it means we are starting to build a community around my channel!  Also networking is super important. Host people after you're done whether they be small or big. It helps to get your name out there. For example: Monday I hosted a bigger streamer (40k followers) not expecting much to come of it other than a thanks BUT instead he paused his game, said more than just thanks, went to my channel and FOLLOWED me. More than 10 people of his community did the same.   TL;DR Keep at it but from time to time take a step back and see what you can improve on! Also network!!"
Twitch,3cnfl9,doomrah,3,Thu Jul 9 08:15:33 2015 UTC,"Like many other streamers the ultimate goal would be becoming a full time streamer. I agree though 100% with you though that this dream is very far away and would take the luck of something crazy to happen.  If you look at some of the streamers that have turned it into a career they are very smart streamers with either another income coming in (Wife, Youtube, Patreon, living situation, ect) or they planned out very well how to do this by living what they can afford only.    The sad truth is a lot of these new streamers see the famous ones living there dream and doing this fulltime, then thinking if I stream I can do it too. They don't understand all the hard work involved and planning years in for how to make it work for them.  When I started streaming I came from youtube with a small following and using just the PS4 now a few years in I am almost hitting 5k followers with a viewer count of 50 to over 100 every stream. As I told my wife even when I get my partnership (here is hoping of course) it's going to be a year or more of looking at finances and seeing how everything works before we can make a choice to make it fulltime. (having a very supporting wife is key)  Talking to other streamers who have had partnership for awhile they still can't live off fulltime and lucky for myself I am a manager for a printing company so as I always do Ill work during the day and stream during the night.  As of now I look at it like with my patreon, it's some extra money for games and equipment for the stream and has become a part time job with the awesome benefit of having a community that has become a second family to us. Even if I never go fulltime I can always look at it as hey I have this awesome part time job to fill in the mundane day one while not worrying about bills and roof over our head.   Not to mention even if you ever make it as a fulltime streamer you need to think of some key factors. First you will hardly ever have a day off or a sick day as you will rely on that daily stream for income. Twitch may partner you but they do not offer benefits, insurance, or tax info. If your having a bad day or tech is being evil you have to deal with this in the best manner or deal with losing followers if your mood is piss poor.  For many of my viewers who see what I am doing and want to do it as well I always tell them this and tons of research is needed in order to start taking off even as a part time streamer.  -ES"
Twitch,3cnfl9,sir_afrodite,3,Thu Jul 9 08:59:29 2015 UTC,"Yes they are if they put very little effort into it.   I say in my panels that I stream for fun because I'm not delusional. My effort that goes into streaming was a 2-3ish hour OBS setup/tweak and merely turning it on before I play each night. I talk to people who offer up comments in chat and give my opinions where I see fit. But I'm not spending 3 hours editing video after each stream fit content.  Why? Because I have other shit to do, like a job and a family. If most of the younger streamers were smart they'd focus on making an actual career out of a skill, rather than streaming. That is unless they really, really like to gamble. Then by all means spend 4 hours of your life each day in your formative years at a computer chasing a dream that you don't put enough effort into. Pros in all aspects of life get lucky sometimes, but time erodes everything and you'll get exposed if you truly don't put in the effort along with the time.  I'm not saying don't do it. Just know what you are getting yourself into and align your expectations (and effort) accordingly.  But I'm just an ""old guy"" playing video games.  Edit: Words."
Twitch,3cnfl9,Jesuswept669,3,Thu Jul 9 15:30:11 2015 UTC,"There is one person I follow who is one of my favorite streamers. He's not the top, but he's up there.   He's a speed runner who isn't the best at the game he speed runs. He's really not all that interesting himself, I don't know why though but I like his stream.  He's not a partner, his viewers range anywhere from 5 to over 200 and he's only sitting at around 3k followers. I think part of the reason I like him is because he is genuine, he is probably the only streamer I have come across who is actually doing it just because he has fun doing it and no other reason.  Ever since I've been watching him he has never had a donate button, I've never seen him ask for money or anything of the sort. Doesn't matter if there are 3 people in his stream or 200+ he acts and plays the exact same way, he doesn't try to impress the larger crowds or start getting all crazy thinking he's going to be the next big hit because of the numbers.  He's not making a dime off of it and he knows it because he doesn't have a donate button. He doesn't have a YouTube channel or a Twitter account. Yet despite all of this he still has a sizable following.  I know a lot of people say ""Oh no, I just do it for the fun"" but as I said in my original post I think the vast majority of people who say this aren't being sincere. They are doing all of the ""tricks"" to get noticed, to get more viewers so they can become a partner. They have a donate button or are partners with some store to get a kickback if people use their promo code.  Maybe that's why most streamers don't make it big. Maybe too many people see a stream and can tell ""This guy just wants to be the next Lirik."" Maybe they aren't actively thinking it but subconsciously they see it and that turns them off.  People have also touched on likening this to music or being a sports star and I agree, those are good examples. But the thing is most people know instantly those things will never happen. If you can't throw a baseball or you're 90 pounds or 600 pounds then you know right away you're not gonna be a baseball star or a football star. If you can't play any musical instrument worth a darn you're not gonna be a musician. Sure you can train yourself or learn these things but people know that takes time and effort and most people can't be bothered and that's the end of that. As others have said the barrier of entry to start streaming is so low (downloading a free program and making a Twitch account) that everyone thinks they can do it and the 1.5 million monthly streamers shows this. There aren't 1.5 million people out there thinking they are going to be a football star if they just show up for tryouts."

Twitch,3cnfl9,TheLlamaUK,2,Thu Jul 9 08:15:08 2015 UTC,"One more thing I wanted to comment on; people saying they don't blame Twitch for wanting to promote their highest streams because they bring in the money, I absolutely agree. Twitch is a company and they are all about making a profit. Just seems odd to me that so many people realize Twitch is the one making money off of all of this, they are using your free labor and talent to bring in viewers just so they can push those viewers to the popular streams so they can subscribe so Twitch can make more money.  If any other business attempted to do this they probably wouldn't last a year. But everyone is in a rush to get their own sub button that they don't mind being used as pawns to make money for a rather large company. Twitch doesn't even need to send these people to the more popular streams to make money off of you, they make money by showing ads during your own stream.  I also don't agree with a statement from a Twitch employee I saw one time; they list the channel with the most viewers first because that channel ""promises"" someone a good show. How can anyone promise that? If more viewers automatically meant good show then all Twitch would need is 1 channel per game, the rest might as well be blocked. Obviously not everyone watches Lirik because not everyone enjoys his show, even if he's playing the exact same game as another streamer they are watching. Personally I don't like most of the big streamers. I think most of them try entirely too hard or entirely too little (yet are still popular for the sake of being popular I suppose.)  As I said before I don't blame Twitch for optimizing the way they make money, what does surprise me is so many people are okay with the very company they are hoping to become a partner with is actively working against them to make it as hard as possible to become a partner."
Twitch,3cnfl9,kevinelguapo,2,Thu Jul 9 16:51:34 2015 UTC,"As someone who has streamed on Twitch since it was only Justin.tv and as someone who streams at least 3 times a week, I must quote Vader and say ""I find your lack of faith disturbing.""  Everyone below who has said it is a matter of perseverance I can totally agree with. I'm not one who usually gives up on things and I am not likely to give up on casting on twitch any time soon.  I've had lots of ups and downs; projects that have succeeded; games that were good but didn't stay good; games that were oversaturated by pro eSports players... heaps of things. It doesn't stop me.  I still have a desire to become a full-time caster. The only reason I am not a full-time caster right now is because I need to be dedicating a LOT of time to be casting full-time. It's like running your own business.  I have a wife and a child and a mortgage. I also have full-time work that occupies my time; and a daily commute that steals 3 hours our of my day getting to and from my place of employment. Due to this I have only limited time I can dedicate to casting; and yet I try to pull at least 16 hours a week (more if I can) on Twitch.  I'm in the position where I must persevere. I must continue. I must keep casting in order to reach my goal of being a full-time caster; or all my effort will be for naught. Does that mean I am deluding myself? I don't think so.  I honestly think it is a realistic view. Getting on Twitch and casting is only one side of things. Exploring your brand and exposing that brand are more important, I feel. And if you can't dedicate that time, then it will take longer. It's not a delusion; the process simply gets drawn out. It is what it is.   If people are patient and driven enough, they can succeed, regardless of their own busy schedule."
Twitch,3cnfl9,Accident_Pedo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:45:14 2015 UTC,"I like ""the cut of your jib"" sir. I think we all know realistically it's a hard trip to become full-time. Just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's not worth it to stream. I'm an older streaming with life challenges as well. I'm not fooling myself, I keep other aspects of my life in order and stream as much as I can. Full-time success for me would be a moderate living that enables me to be my own boss and live where I want and be independent. Also, opening up a micro brewery on the side would be nice ;)"

I'm 2 months in now and 640 follows, it's very small compared to the partners 43528098243570 followers, but so far I have enjoyed myself so much!  I have about 15 regulars which is nothing, a viewership that rarely goes over 8-9 concurrent.   Now, would I like to make a living from Twitch? Who wouldn't! But the chances of this are tiny, almost impossible because small streamers are dwarfed by the large ones, which as someone said Twitch need to promote as they bring in the revenue! Nobody can hold a grudge against big streamers or Twitch for this, it's a business after all.  I stream daily, 7-8 hours a day, I have had 3-4 days off in 2 months and I will continue to grind it out because I enjoy gaming, Twitch has made it possible for me to share the fun of gaming with a few people and that is awesome.

Twitch,3cnfl9,EmutheFoo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:44:54 2015 UTC,I think there are many who instantly think they are going to have success on twitch. When it doesn't happen right away or after a few weeks they decide to just quit.   I fall into the category in that I am streaming purely for fun. I expect to make zero money from streaming. If over time my followers/viewers grow then great but I am not going to be discouraged if it doesn't either. Also doesn't help I'm streaming super popular games but those are the games I like so again I have already accepted a vast majority of people won't even see my stream haha.
Twitch,3cnfl9,Accident_Pedo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:34:38 2015 UTC,"If streaming is something you truly want to do, you'll do it. Anything worth having in life is worth working hard/fighting for. I can't tell you how many people I've seen give up after a few days/weeks of talking to themselves. It's ridiculous.  When I started back in December I had 1 viewer, if I was lucky. Now? I average 10-20 a stream with the occasional wanderer. And I plan to continue to grow and improve my stream so that my viewers get the best content possible.  If ""making it big"" is someone's first priority, they'll never achieve it. It's not about the streamers, it's about the viewers. They come first."

""I do it for fun"" is a blanked statement but I think most everyone who says that cares about making progress, that's just human nature. If you put forth an effort you expect some type of return.

Twitch,3cnfl9,Jokosmash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:58:58 2015 UTC,"I can admit that I have had dreams of making it big on Twitch, and being as big as some of the top streamers right now. I think everyone has that fantasy dream where it's like ""I can do that! I can be that successful!"" However, those are just dreams. I started streaming so that I could play the solo player games that I love but with the ability to have conversation with others. This is truly how it's been too. I've had a couple of people hang out in my stream every day, and they have helped me with strategies for bosses and stuff.  My biggest concern with Twitch as a career is it's not stable. It is completely possible that everyone who makes a career off of Twitch will lose that job one day. It really all depends on where the culture goes. That's why it's important to have a real stable job that you can fall back on. No one should give up everything to become a streamer. It's just not worth it. Now, does this mean I don't want to still become big on Twitch? No. I actually have a bunch of ideas of how I would improve my stream if I were to become a partner. It's just not in the cards right now, and that's fine. The ideas are there, and if it's ment to happen it will. Until then, I will continue my stream of just hanging out, playing some games (going for platinum trophies right now), and chatting with some cool people.  If someone comes into Twitch expecting success, they're just setting themself up for dissapointment. Not because they aren't entertaining or good at the game they stream, but because they are not in the right mindset."
Twitch,3cnfl9,SanguineHaze,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:20:47 2015 UTC,I don't think you can assume that everyone streaming is trying out to make it big. I myself occasionally stream wow raids for my friends who cannot for a reason or another join us in game.

Nobody should even think about a sub button, lets look at it another way.. you got big name streamers that hit it big with 1 or 2 games that really shot them up the ranks.. but you got that number from maybe 1000+ people streaming that same game at the same time.. You hear alot of those big streamers talk about positioning, and finding the right game at the right time.. and that is true.. but it is only true for a few, not the many and the many are expecting to be the few.  I dont know why people actually talk about dropping out of school to stream, or not going to college to try streaming.. think about where you live, and the cost of living.. sure someone may make it big but live in North Dakota, or Montana or anywhere where cost of living is small.. but you take LA, New York, San Diego, San Fran (insert major US city).. probably need double the sub count to live comfortably.. of course if you live with your parents and never plan on moving out.. well there ya go.

That said, I'm still going to continue watching and streaming as much as I can - because I'd be gaming anyhow, and it's always funner to interact while doing so.

Twitch,3cnfl9,kevinelguapo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:36:45 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of someone who contacted me about a year ago wanting me to create some channel art for them (for free, of course). They had stated in their email that their family was going through a tough time financially and they wanted to make some money by streaming. One of the problems is that some new (or even old) Twitch viewers will go to a stream and see that people are being given tips/donations and they feel like it would be easy for them to do the same. Streaming is an investment. Smart investments take a lot of time, hard work, research, knowledge, and even luck. If you make an educated investment (of either time or money) you still aren't guaranteed to get a return. Many are making uneducated investments (the fact that they think they can get some easy cash by playing games), and these are the types who quit pretty quickly. I 100% understand where you're coming from with this post, however I find it a touch pessimistic. Sure, not everyone will get a following from streaming, but you never know until you try. It's definitely possible to grow your stream and community to a point where you can go full-time; I've seen it. I admit that it's not especially common, but it's possible if you're smart/self-aware/talented enough."
Twitch,3cnfl9,LucentBeam8MP,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:39:17 2015 UTC,"Dear Redditors/Twitchers. I have read through this with a, not insignificant, feeling of helplessness. The reason behind this, is that I have read many problems and issues fellow streamers face, but no sign of a solution to help the ""Little Guy"" who is drowning in this sea of viewers, without being noticed. As one user posted that even the knowledge of this very group can have an impact on your streaming success.   Many of you have commented on the likeness of being a musician/artist et al, and I agree, but also feel that you could be the best musician in the world, but if nobody hears you... Is there a magic mix? A secret formula to twitch success? Well, kinda sorta :) Many of you have already commented on the nuances of streaming and the amount of time and dedication that is needed to achieve your goal of fame/self sufficiency/partnership/sponsorship. Even the many types of streamer ""Entertainers, Pro Gamers, Speed Runners, 'Cam Girls'"" as drewlinskii mentions.  I don't believe I have seen any mention of the importance of networking quite yet, which is an almost essential tool in my eyes. I want to avoid this post feeling like a Monday morning marketing meeting (too late?), so I will just say that I feel like networking is almost a quarter of the battle. After all, If another streamer likes you, who's to say that their friends and viewers wont either.  I myself am a mere co-host to a gaming talk show. As such, I don't feel I will ever ""Make it"" in streaming. Although I do feel that with time and effort your numbers do grow.   So, onto the question at hand. Are people really fooling themselves? The sad fact of the matter it that not everyone can be a Lirik or Sodapopin. Does that mean you shouldn't try? Hell no :D We have viewers that drop by from the bigger streams simply because what they were watching, had changed in some way.  I don't mean this post to come off as being negative, but it has to be said that it is a very long and difficult road. Most definitely not an impossible road by any means, just a difficult one.

Twitch,3cpzyu,ThatOneGifGuy,3,Fri Jul 10 05:53:45 2015 UTC,"A recap from another thread:  We're totally aware of this internally, and we really want to fix it, but it's in a very, very touchy area of the system (because, you know, if we bork this part of the system, the site stops working for everyone, everywhere), and the promotion process doesn't do anything gentle (because in the past, generally only partners got transcodes, so we didn't really care too much if their stream blipped when we flipped the switch).  As we add additional capacity, and the threshold goes down, we are hoping that the issue affects fewer and fewer people during the best parts of their stream. ""Hope is not a strategy"" is something I throw around a lot, so we do have a real plan to investigate, but the details are not public information at this time. As you rightly guess, there is not an easy fix.  The transition should be, on average, 4-12 seconds (usually at the lower end) for promotion-related weirdness. As for ""repercussions"", that's mostly around user education, so if you guys would pretty please tell your viewers that the weirdness is your fault for being so awesome that you get enough viewers to get transcodes, we'd appreciate it. (Or, if you just tell them that transcodes cause streams to go weird for a bit and to calm the fuck down, that works too).  I'll bring up an opt-out policy when I can, but I wouldn't hold your breath. It's only superficially easy, and there's a lot of decisions around edge cases, and what if people leave it on forever and forget about it, etc. etc.  That's all I got. Sorry the blips are weird, but at least you get transcodes in return!  PS if you're at the point where this is happening, DO NOT RESTART YOUR STREAM TO ""FIX IT"". You'll just make it worse for you (it doesn't affect anyone but you and your viewers), and it'll go through the whole f@#$ing thing again.

I do fully agree that storing the streams locally isn't all that painful. I know that since I've downloaded the last 4 streams I've wanted to archive due to the issue I'm describing. It was more of a convenience thing than anything, as I was one of those streamers who actually used the built-in export tool to create new ""episodes"" to toss on YouTube. When my VoD was a single piece, I could split it in two via the highlight tool, and then upload both halves. Now, in order to get things up, I have to either download or record the stream locally, toss the clip(s) into an editor, render out the videos, and then reupload the footage. I'm making it out to be a bigger deal than it is, I realize, but I loved the simplicity of it before.  Since I have your attention, quick question: is there a Twitch-sanctioned method of obtaining your streams without just recording them locally? Certainly plenty of people like to use 3rd party tools to do so, but I was curious if there was something that you guys preferred.

Are you running any antivirus/malware protection?  If so, does disabling it make a difference? Are you using some kind of proxy to connect to Twitch (or the internet in general)?  Are you on a school/work network or just at home?   Thanks in advance!"
Twitch,3cqk8a,IrelandOfEndor,2,Fri Jul 10 05:41:48 2015 UTC,"Hey, semi related but this is the first time ive seen a twitch staff member here so thought id ask here.  Since the twitch chat update I have been unable to load twitch chat at all. which sucks as a viewer but is detrimental when streaming. All that happens is i get the circle in the middle and it never changes, even after watching for hours.  Ive tried it on a few browsers:  Windows 7 Home Premium (x64) Service Pack 1 (build 7601)  Google Chrome Version 43.0.2357.132 m   FireFox 36.0.4  Internet Explorer11 version: 11.0.9600.17843  My Anti-virus is ZoneAlarm Extreme Security version: 13.1.211.000  and disabling this makes chat work straight away so I have contacted zone alarm as well but thought id let you know partly to let you guys know and in hope you have a solution.   O and I do not run any proxies and it is on my home network. Hope you can help or at least this helps you guys as you continue to improve twitch :)"
Twitch,3cqk8a,reddevil18,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:47:41 2015 UTC,"Heya this was happening at work on Friday, I'm at home now where everything, but I RDP'd back in to test and I can send messages now. But the JS console is still full of websocket errors.  Even with all Chrome extensions turned off I'm getting WS errors.  Here's some screenshots that hopefully will help:  JS Console errors: http://i.imgur.com/dsYcVHK.png Headers of the failed WS connection: http://i.imgur.com/zldvlN0.png Data of the failed WS connection: http://i.imgur.com/2GErbBG.png  The first 5 WS connections there (excluding the firebase one) were failed chat connections. Then the final connection to 192.16.64.145 succeeded, here's the info from that connection:  Headers: http://i.imgur.com/nt5bm6R.png Data: http://i.imgur.com/R8Jhqdj.png  Interestingly the only difference is that the final connection was on port 443. Weird that the firebase connection on port 80 was fine though. (see http://i.imgur.com/KA6x8SZ.png )  Now I'm on a work network with a Sonicwall gateway, though we dont have a proxy server, I do think the Sonicwall runs a transparent proxy, though we have almost every feature turned off except IDS and my specific PC has full unrestricted access. Also I've never had issues with websockets through these firewalls before as we develop our own internal app using websockets without issue. I also had a look at the firewall logs and there's no entries at all. But I don't see why it would work at home but not work.   Chrome Version 44.0.2403.81 beta-m (64-bit), Windows 8.1. No anti virus other than Windows Defender, same issue when I disable that though.  I tested in IE11 and have exactly the same issue though the error message in the console is ""SCRIPT12152: WebSocket Error: Network Error 12152, The server returned an invalid or unrecognised response"" - though I don't know how to check WS requests in the IE network tab.  Seeems like it could be the work Sonicwall getting in the way since it works fine here at home with all the similar browser/OS setup, just with a consumer router. I'll see if there's anything I can do to rule it out. The weird thing was the the actual issue I was having on Friday was not being able to send chat messages without being disconnected immediately. Though now it's just the constant connection failures until it tries on port 443 which is why I think it's probably the firewall.  Hope this helps."
Twitch,3cqk8a,shaunol,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:02:02 2015 UTC,"It looks like there is some transparent proxy shenanigans going on on the firewall at work, I had a look through all the settings but I don't know enough about the device to know exactly what could be causing the issue but most settings were off. It's not something I could go to the network guys for really. Kind of confirms it that the final port 443/SSL WS connection works but I also just used an SSH tunnel for my SOCKS proxy and the websockets connected immediately with no issue. Think its just gonna be one of those things unless everything is going through HTTPS by default :("

Twitch,3clbpy,Failstar,5,Wed Jul 8 20:16:02 2015 UTC,Completely agreed! Planning and having something to talk about would really help someone when streaming. Points 5 & 7 are really important. Well written!

And I didn't care if anyone watched, because I was gonna play drums to an empty room anyways if I wasn't live.  I think I got as many as 15 people watching, and I only streamed for an hour (metal drumming is good cardio).  It was very hard to interact, as I had a laptop with my dashboard open, but my mics were set for drum volume, not talking volume.  I had a blast, and want to start back up when I get my hardware in order."

Twitch,3clbpy,chhopsky,3,Wed Jul 15 14:01:16 2015 UTC,"Great guide.  Well spoken.  This isn't just for the ""audience of none"" caster either.  Once you do become successful, and chat is moving a mile a minute--you will revert to what you learned here.  The sea of chat will be impossible to hold a conversation with, so its like you are performing to yourself all over again."
Twitch,3clbpy,linkwall,5,Wed Jul 8 20:29:21 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else find casting to an audience of none exhausting?  Back when I was recording videos for YouTube I found my limit to be around three hours. Beyond that and I start running out of gas. It didn't really matter on YouTube as I could always edit in post commentary, an option not available when live casting.   I can't imagine I'm the only one."
Twitch,3clbpy,PsionicArchon,2,Thu Jul 9 03:59:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, it's terribly exhausting.  It's a mixture of drive and being optimistic that will keep you going.   There are other keys to viewership though that don't just involve this, getting your name out there in a legitimate way can be extremely difficult, which is why I mentioned the networking, among other things.   The main reason I wrote this is that being a lone performer is a personal hurdle of mine and I've asked for help. I've never planned on turning my hobby into $$$, but I really want to provide some entertainment to try to make people feel the same way I do when I watch a stream (Which, consequently, is what keeps me going :D)"

Twitch,3clbpy,snowlit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:57:43 2015 UTC,"This is an excellent post! I agree with all the points you made. I often find myself telling viewers how my day went, several times per stream, and if something big happened, I end up talking about it over and over, more often than not. Viewers want to relate to the streamer, and sometimes that does require repeating stuff you've already said or talked about, just so new viewers get in on it too. I'm not sure if I'm making sense lol but the point I'm trying to make is that, being relatable makes it likelier for viewers to stick around and come back. Make it seem as though you're sitting in the same room just having a conversation with viewers :)"
Twitch,3clbpy,zombiexpickle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:11:08 2015 UTC,"This is an amazing guide, thank you! I started off with having about 1-2 concurrent viewers on my stream and I am slowly reaching to 15 every stream now. I have done some video work before but one tip is always to know that the camera will always over-exaggerate your emotions. Be it happy or sad, the camera picks up and highlights every intricate thing. So if you think you're being overboard on camera with a huge hand wave, trust me: you're not."
Twitch,3clbpy,Collected1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:03:33 2015 UTC,"Random tip from a viewer not streamer.. when you do get viewers.. even if just one or two.. engage with them. Welcome them if they say something in chat, thank them if they hit follow.. and be genuine. Don't make it sound like a robotic ""hey xx welcome to the chat"". I've found that streamers who have that level of engagement are more likely to keep me interested. But also don't take it personally if they don't reply or if they leave etc. That's the nature. But by engaging with them I think you're increasing the chances of them sticking around. Just my 2p worth."

Twitch,3clbpy,ShoutmonXHeart,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:05:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think a good piece of advice for any streamer is to actually rewatch their past broadcasts. You can see how you look like to the crowd, improve your performance from this and heck, things like audio levels, image/sound quality etc are all apparent from just watching VODs. You don't get that feedback in OBS."
Twitch,3clbpy,userrnam,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:56:00 2015 UTC,"Great guide, very intricate. The only problem I see is that if you try to plan out what you're going to say, a lot of viewers will notice that you may seem unnatural when speaking and instantly leave.  I also think planning can take away from the fun of streaming, or even send some people into a panic if they forget what they planned to say. Of course, that is only for some people.  If you find yourself speaking to 0 people more often than not, I'd advise trying to never look at the view count and just naturally play the game.  tl;dr If planning stresses you out, don't plan. Just have fun playing your game!"
Twitch,3clbpy,zombiexpickle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:08:33 2015 UTC,"I think the point was that you can't just jump between games and expect traction. Viewers are along for a journey with you and jumping mid-game to another is not really great for retention. So having a basic plan of where you want to have the stream, the type of community you want to grow, and the games you will be playing will work amazingly. Also, having a schedule (even if you yolo it once in a while) will build excellent retention as viewers will know when to expect you again. :)     I think the planning on what to say is more to help build your own personal skill as someone who can do idle chitter-chatter, especially if there is no one in stream. It may also be a reminder to be like ""okay, talk now!"" since talking endlessly doesn't come natural to everyone. :)"
Twitch,3cpz93,whitetail178,3,Thu Jul 9 21:03:59 2015 UTC,"Because timezones are a thing (it's still the 9th here in america) I'd assume it might take a little longer for it to renew.

Twitch,3cpwzg,greenpoe,6,Thu Jul 9 20:47:27 2015 UTC,"Hey there!    I'm a partnered streamer with over 20k followers. There were times in the past that my average views were between 200 and 600 concurrent viewers in every stream. I have even had as many as 3000! Man, that was crazy!    Lately, I get around an average of 30 concurrent views every stream. Sometimes I will have 60 or 70 and sometimes I will have less than 20.  I attribute this to a few things. I used to play indie games and only indie games. I would have devs on the show all the time, and continually show off games that most people haven't heard of. I would get embedded on sites and get tons and tons of views.That was when I was doing my best.  At some point, I decided that I just wanted to do what I wanted to do, so I would play more mainstream games that I wanted to play and just play the games I was into. There was even a 6 month period where a company paid me by the hour to play their game. This game wasn't very popular and I lost many viewers because most people didn't like the game, but I had to pay my bills at that time, and it did pay the bills, for a while.  I have changed my graphics so many times,  I can't even count, had different kinds of shows, and now I stream at all different hours than I used to and sometimes it does feel like I can't pick up traction.   I stopped looking at my viewer count during the stream and just stream now. I have a great time and play the kinds of things that I want to play.   I used to stream with the goal of making it my full time gig, but through streaming, I got an amazing job as a community manager and game developer liaison and don't stress about the money.   It can be very depressing to hear that the odds of making it as a full time streamer are almost nothing because there are literally almost 2 million live streamers on Twitch, but if you stream because you love to do it, then the numbers don't matter. What matters is that you are doing something you love and even if there are 2 people there in the chat with you all the time, they are there with you and you can get to know them and be their friends.  Don't worry about your slump, just go forward and have fun streaming. If you can't have fun streaming to 2 people or even an empty chat, then there is really no point in streaming at all.  I'm sure that there are other reasons that I'm not aware of for this decline in viewership and I might not ever know what they are, but even so, I love to stream so I am going to keep doing it as long as I want to."
Twitch,3cpwzg,TheRealIndie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:23:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks, reading this makes me a feel a lot better knowing that I'm not alone in this.  It's a lot harder to stream when the chat gets really slow, but you're right, gotta be ready to entertain even if its for an empty room."
Twitch,3cpwzg,TheRealIndie,2,Thu Jul 9 22:00:21 2015 UTC,"You are quite welcome.   Just know that in the past, I basically used to obsess about numbers even though I didn't want to admit it to myself or anyone else.   It was really hard to break that cycle and sometimes it is hard to not look at the numbers while streaming, but for me, it's best to not do it.   Stream because you want to share. Stream because you want to entertain. Stream because you effing love to stream and you love your community."

Twitch,3cpwzg,ShankAMuffin,2,Thu Jul 9 22:36:48 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. A few people have unfollowed because I haven't been usually streaming the game that they discovered me on.   Tell you the truth, depends on what game you play. And as always times change. Everything isn't going to be the same for years on end. There's bound to be some jumps and dives."
Twitch,3cpwzg,ShankAMuffin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:57:24 2015 UTC,"Hm, okay, so which games have worked out well?  For me, I started with Mario games (Mario World, SMW2, SM64), Donkey Kong, and Megaman games.  My most successful game was Portal 2 for sure.  I've noticed significantly less success if I've already played a game before too."

Twitch,3cpwzg,TheRealIndie,2,Thu Jul 9 21:40:19 2015 UTC,"I'm currently in a high point period with 200-350 viewers concurrent each stream, and I've been around there in the past as well. However, I've also had months where getting 100-150 viewers was the norm and even getting a 100 viewers could be difficult. There's one thing I've learned, and it's that the thing that dictates your viewership more than anything else is your level of exposure.  Your content, your mood, your schedule, your consistency - It all affects your viewership but not as much as everyone is convinced it does.  If I streamed unlisted I'd likely only get 50-150 viewers and there would be nothing I could do to my content to bring that number up.   As a comparison I spent today streaming in Destiny making a ""Strange Coin"" from the game - But with a relatively high amount of downtime and shenaniganry and not super great results with the work I was doing.   But I sat on 500-800 viewers nonetheless. Not because the content was great but because the Destiny servers were down for over 5 hours and none of the big streamers were live.  That also meant people couldn't play the game and I would get a lot of action from viewers who needed to pass the time until the servers were back up.  If you really want to grow your channel you have to focus on one thing over everything else - And that's exposure. Place your channel in favorable positions where people will find it easily, and know that if your view count is suffering it is often times the result of poor exposure and nothing else.   Exposure is most often out of your control but you can create your own luck by being aware of how Twitch works and take chances when you see them.   This is the most valuable lesson I've learned over the past year. I realize a lot of people will disagree with my approach here and it's based on nothing else than my experience.."
Twitch,3cpwzg,gogims,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:29:44 2015 UTC,That makes total sense! Exposure from getting embedded on bundle sites is why I have 3.6 million views!
Twitch,3cpwzg,justmeandmyself10,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:23:16 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more!! That's why most people suggest small streamers to start with games with less competition (even though it has less viewers) and it all comes down to that: exposure.  Even though I know that, I am at a point where I was feeling I was playing games as a part time job rather than a hobby. And even though as a small streamer I shouldn't play saturated games (like Rocket League), I won't stop doing it because it's been a while since I didn't have that much fun in a video game.  Knowing that, makes me ease at myself when I know why am I not getting that many viewers/followers.   I decided to prioritize my enjoyment over the stream.  Ideally it would be better if the thing you enjoy the most, is the one that could give you the most exposure. It's not always that way though :P"
Twitch,3cpwzg,DJbeast35,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:29:00 2015 UTC,"Speaking from personal experience there must be some ""beginner's luck"" going on.  My very first day streaming I gained around 30 followers and my viewer count peaked at around 40, I dunno, maybe people actually liked me or they just wanted to help a new streamer out. The next day I got like 7 followers and my viewers topped out at around 20. A week later I was averaging maybe 1 new follower a day and my view count rarely went above 5.  I think a big problem with streaming is there is so much competition. Someone might visit your channel and really like you but the next time they are watching streams and you're not around they might find someone they like better and then you've lost a viewer.  I've read several stories about people who are afraid to cut back on the number of hours or days they stream because they are afraid they'll lose viewers to other streamers, and with 1.5 million broadcasters that's a really legitimate fear.  I notice it even with some of the bigger streamers, when I watched their stream 2 years ago they were sitting on 5000+ viewers whenever I checked it out, a few days ago I checked out some of those streamers nowadays and they are barely breaking 2000 viewers.  I also remember watching a streamer a couple of years ago who was talking about how he hadn't been streaming very much in the past couple of weeks because he was busy and he said during that time he lost a lot of subs and his viewer count really tanked. I'm pretty sure that guy isn't streaming anymore. All because he took a couple of weeks off :/  As more people enter the streaming game it's bound to draw some viewers away from others."
Twitch,3cpwzg,gogims,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:15:30 2015 UTC,I used to get 30-40 viewers when I lived in Germany due to the military and I moved back to the states and couldnt stream for 3 months and now I am back at 10-20 viwers normally and I havent lost any followers so I think people just move on or they might find another streamer they really like that they can associate with more! I just keep positive and appreciate all the people that come into my stream. Viewers will come! Hopefully sooner than later! Good Luck to you!
Twitch,3cpwzg,DJbeast35,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:56:29 2015 UTC,"To be honest, your retention rate is pretty damn high. You should feel very happy that your viewers came back 3 months later. Not everybody can achieve that :)"

Twitch,3cpwzg,Dorbii,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:23:41 2015 UTC,"The time you stream has a huge impact. I used to stream 11-5 CST and would average 10-17 viewers with 10 of those being regulars. Now since I got a job as an admin I have to stream 5-8 and ive lost alot of viewers. My regulars live over seas and they are asleep which is part of the issue. Now though, I feel like I took a step back. I'm still having fun and am planing on early morning streams for my old regulars on the weekends but you just have to accept it for what it is.

One thing I'd love to see with RP and D&D streams is this: Get into it.   Make things interesting. Get a voice for yea going, get emotion in your tone, make it seem as if it's a show. An example of such is Heimskr from Skyrim. (not the way you act, but the emotion and emphasis on the words, the meaning, the pressure.) I most certainly would think that it makes for an interesting stream.   Be forewarned. It may not work out at first, try to find a way that it works for you.

It would only cost like 100 bucks to slap another 8 gb in there. As for the CPU your CPU looks pretty good but I noticed there was a HUGE difference when I upgraded from a 3.2 to a  4.0 GHz i7.   If it is your stream itself I'd lower your bitrate. If you are at 3500 try tuning it down to like 2500 and see where that takes you.

The issue mostly affects Chrome users (since it bundles flash and auto-updates), but the same will happen to other browsers if you update flash player. You can downgrade flash (which will leave a big security hole in your browser!), or watch using livestreamer until there is a fix available.  I don't know if Adobe or Twitch are at fault, but I hope this will be resolved within the next days."

Sony Vegas - Lacks a few features depending what version you have compared to Adobe premiere and still costs quite a bit, easier to learn and also plenty of tutorials on youtube.

The 502 might work with your mic depending on the electrical design of the mic but more likely you need the +48v or you might do damage to your mic.

Remember, that a lot of the stuff going on at TwitchCon will be streamed on Twitch anyway. For the price of it, it's not worth going to just to learn and network yourself as a streamer, you go to these kind of conventions to meet up with people, maybe your favorite streamer(s), attending some conferences and stuff like that.  Sure it's going to be great fun, but for what you're asking for, the convention being an 'investment' - I don't see it being able to teach you how to grow your channel and you making this money back.

The reasons I just described were enough for me, but I'm also fairly comfortable with the setup I have for the time being. If you truly believe the money could be used to make some much-needed upgrades to your rig/mic/etc., it might be wise to focus on those things first. Whatever the case, good luck!"
Twitch,3cpad8,AethWolf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like I would enjoy going for the same reason as you. Maybe I am treating this too seriously overall, but at least I am learning.   Basically,  I would be coming from Florida, and round trip flights would be around $500, not to mention I do not know anyone in Cal, so a hotel would be a must. Couple that with food for the weekend, merch, etc.  My stream set up is decent right now, if anything, I would probably just buy a better video card, or maybe an SSD to have faster times on games. Thanks for your advice though! :)"
Twitch,3cpad8,ollee,3,Thu Jul 9 20:30:41 2015 UTC,"It's probably not worth it as an investment. I imagine a lot of the panels will end up on YouTube one way or another, which means you could get most of the ""investment"" opportunities except for networking for free.   That said, I'd be considering the con more as an educational vacation than an investment opportunity."
Twitch,3cpad8,ollee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"I never actually thought about this, even though it seems that simple. I think I will probably sit this one out.   After all, it is the first one, so there is always next year, and maybe it will be an actual vacation :)  Thanks!"
Twitch,3cpad8,thatsoalykat,2,Thu Jul 9 20:36:33 2015 UTC,"I've made twitch my number 1 hobby, absorbing a lot is my time and is going to twitchcon a wise investment? Likely not. But it's rather cheap for me, I'll get to meet a lot of cool people, hopefully make some new friends, see San Francisco and really have a good time. I'm not expecting to benefit from this beyond the positive experience that will be associated with the relationships I might be able to build.   Ps if anyone wants to grab a beer, drop me a pm"
Twitch,3cpad8,Oremm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"Very strong points. I would be coming from Florida, so I would have to take a flight, so it would be more expensive.   Thanks for your input! It really helps :)"

Twitch,3cpad8,Imagine42,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:06:57 2015 UTC,my entire trip from NYC looked like maybe 1300 you are so  lucky.  I wanted to go to network as well I think I'll stalk NYCC and try for pax east
Twitch,3cpad8,thatsoalykat,2,Thu Jul 9 23:46:10 2015 UTC,"Ask yourself:   Am I already partnered and somewhat successful? Are the time and money needed insignificant to me?   If you answered ""no"" then it's not an investment, it's just a vacation.  That's not to say that there's nothing to gain. You might learn a lot that you can take back and put to use.  It will probably be a great time too.  But ""investment"" is quite the stretch, from a cost-benefit point of view."
Twitch,3cpad8,g33z3r_hd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:35:56 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely correct. I didn't make this post to have people agree with me, or convince me to go, but rather for points like this.   I think I shouldn't have used the word ""investment"" haha. After all, there would be no profit gain of any sort. I think I should have used ""networking"" instead since that would be more feasible.   Thank you for your points, I needed this."
Twitch,3cpad8,FanaticDreamer,2,Thu Jul 9 20:42:49 2015 UTC,"It will undoubtedly be a great place to meet like-minded people, but perhaps if you don't live in the SF area you could start a local meetup, similar to how Swiftor has started one here in NY."
Twitch,3cp77h,ANIMATE1016,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:38:41 2015 UTC,"I made a tool called StreamCalc.net to help people figure out their stream settings. I recommend 2000Kbps for non-partnered streamers so as to avoid too many viewers having buffering problems. Go to StreamCalc, enter that bitrate and the game and it'll tell you what resolution to use (approximately). You can probably use a slower x264 CPU preset too - experiment a bit but if you lower the resolution you'll have more CPU power to spare so the ""fast"" preset."
Twitch,3cp77h,UltimaN3rd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:22:58 2015 UTC,Does lowering the CPU preset do any significant improvement to the stream? I was wondering mainly because I am looking for ways to improve picture quality without increasing the bitrate too much.
Twitch,3cp77h,ZinniePlays,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:09:19 2015 UTC,Yeah it actually makes quite a big difference. I can't remember the url but there's a pretty good image comparison of the different x264 CPU presets.
Twitch,3cp77h,UltimaN3rd,0,Thu Jul 9 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"Hello, for running 720p @ 30 fps, the bitrate should be somewhere around 1800-2000 and maybe try the ""superfast"" CPU preset. Also bicubic sharper seems to look good, shouldnt over-tax your system too much,   An i7 will of course help depending on the rest of your system. Personally, I would get another 8 GB of ram before upgrading the CPU. Good luck buddy   Rocky"
Twitch,3cp77h,One_Rocky,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:43:49 2015 UTC,Thank your sir! Yeah I plan on getting the i7 and the ram at the same time.  The thing with the xenon processor is I need a gpu. I have 2 980s in the gaming PC. My thought s r to for go the gpu and use integrated graphics on the streaming PC. Which is why I'm leaning towards the 4790k
Twitch,3cp77h,rockstarking,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:56:39 2015 UTC,"more than 8 gb shouldn't be needed if all it is doing is encoding.  You should be able to crank out on slow, slowest, or even placebo presets and still be only at 80-90% or less cpu usage. I can stream at 3300 kbs 720 60 fps on faster and it look good while getting 80-150 fps in game on a single pc. Your cap card must be crap."
Twitch,3cp407,namelesscss,3,Thu Jul 9 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"The amount of streams that can get transcoders was increased recently, so not a bug."
Twitch,3cp407,Imagine42,3,Thu Jul 9 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"Officially confirming this as the reason. /u/MellowNebula pointed to the announcement, but for those who don't like clicking links - we lowered the bar for getting in on those sweet transcodes, and there's a dynamic threshold that varies as demand fluctuates throughout the day. It's basically optimizing for not having idle transcode boxes (waste not want not...) by picking the top streams until we don't have more capacity."
Twitch,3cp407,BlitzTech,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"Do you know if there's any consideration being put into making the transition from regular to transcoding a smoother experience? I've been picking up the quality options every night since you guys introduced the expanded service, and while it's been awesome to get the opportunity, the stream suffers for about 5 minutes after the changeover, and splits the VoD at awkward points.   That being said, I love this new update. You guys are really stepping up your game with this, and it makes little guys like myself feel like we're being cared about in addition to the partners. Keep it up!"
Twitch,3cp407,Shado_Temple,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:47:21 2015 UTC,"Lots of discussion, but there are several technical choices made years ago that need to be revisited before we can offer a smoother transition. Smoothly continuing requires a ton of work around the promotion process, which (as you might expect) we are very careful to test extensively.  Of course, it doesn't help when people see the stream go wonky for a few seconds (minutes is a giant outlier) and go offline and come back up to ""fix it"". Don't do that. You make us sad because we put a bunch of work into getting the smaller streams some tasty transcodes, and then you throw them away."
Twitch,3cp407,BlitzTech,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"Damn. This is a perfect response. Here I just made a full post about it, since I was afraid this got buried. Glad to hear it's being discussed. As someone who works in software porting for embedded systems, I know that feeling of working through decisions made years before. Again, thanks for the change!"
Twitch,3cp407,Shado_Temple,2,Thu Jul 9 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"I'll pass along those thanks - I don't work on that team, but they're about 5m away.  I did miss your original point about VoDs getting borked. I'll bring that one up. In the meantime, the best solution I can suggest is get more viewers so you just have transcodes all the time. Obviously the easiest solution, as we both know. ;) (but seriously, if you're already getting in on the transcode juice, it probably won't take too much more to get them sooner and not break the good parts of the VoD)"
Twitch,3cp407,BlitzTech,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"Another easy solution, of course, would be for me to get partnership ;).   But yeah, I got lucky last night by bringing people in early last night. Maybe I'll try running longer intros, to give people time to get in so we can have the transition happen when no one cares. In any case, keep up the good work!"
Twitch,3cp407,Shado_Temple,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:52:39 2015 UTC,I want to echo /u/shado_temple's concern here. Such a rough transition to transcoding would ruin the experience for my viewers as I am giving a live music performance tomorrow.  Can I opt out?
Twitch,3cp407,Oremm,2,Thu Jul 9 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"We hadn't really considered that people wouldn't want transcodes, so no, there is no way to opt out at this time. Sorry :-/"
Twitch,3cp407,BlitzTech,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:16:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, transcodes would be wonderful - but the possibility of having viewers miss out on anything more than a second or two while switching them on is what I was concerned with.  Thanks for replying though :D"
Twitch,3cp407,Oremm,2,Thu Jul 9 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"I know, I'm sympathetic to your concern. It literally hadn't occurred to anyone (I think) that getting transcodes wouldn't be wanted.   I hope your performance goes well, and may there be enough concurrent viewers tomorrow night that the transcode limit is just a bit above you! Or you get enough viewers to transcode right away. Or transcodes just happen during a brief period of silence.  Whatever you do, don't cross down the stream. Restarting the stream will make it worse."
Twitch,3cp407,BlitzTech,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the well-wishes!  Friday prime-time is usually pretty hefty competition, so hopefully I'm concerned over nothing :D"

While I can't specifically tell you where to look, I can tell you this; understand where all of your audio enters and leaves your computer.  Know the flow between enter and exit that exists inside of your computer.  Once you understand that part, you should be able to look at the audio flow and figure out where the problems are coming from and get your audio tweaked to a proper and acceptable level and quality."

You might not know, but it is really obvious when a streamer is acting to impress viewers   I don't agree with this at all.   Im going to be blunt, but a lot of people, myself included, with our normal voices and attitudes are simply not fun to watch.  You need to do a certain amount of acting, which includes sounding excited, changing pitch in voice, and more.   As an example, how come people like Tmartn are huge? Look at all of his videos. Does he ever sound bored/tired? Is his pitch monotone? Look at streamers like iiJerichoii, Lirik, Giantwaffle, etc. They all don't sound boring, and it is a HUGE aspect when keeping people entertained.   Aside from that, great guide/PSA."

I've looked in to this myself and up until very recently I couldn't see any benefit to streaming on a second PC unless you were struggling for resources on the gaming PC.  My laptop streams my game where the game is running at 60fps no problem at all, and that's with browsers and other things open at the same time.  So i'd think about what problem you're solving first before you spend money on hardware - if only because that may affect what hardware you want to get.  For me, I AM looking at moving to a streaming PC now because the gaming laptop i'm using has a real problem with USB ports - even with powered hubs I can't plug many devices in, and as I have a controller with 7 Flight sim gauges, I need about 20+ USB devices plugged in and it makes the machine run badly to say the least... so removing the cameras will ease the load on the USB bus a lot I think (I use two cameras).  For this, i'm currently planning on a StarTech USB 3.0 Video Capture Device - £146 on Amazon at the moment.  Don't get a USB capture unless it's USB 3 (all my machines are laptops so I have to get something external) - if you can go with an internal expansion card I think there are some common recommendations but I must admit it's outside of my area of knowledge."

Question that remains is which capture card does the service best?"

Don't feed the trolls, and ask your viewers also to not feed them by reacting or responding.  Troll's try to get a reaction and if they don't get one they get bored.  I have a pop-up ""thanks for the follow xyz"" type thing on my stream, as soon as the trolls start I kill it because you end up with ""you_are_a_fat_xyz - thanks for following"" coming up and that's enough to feed them.  Turn it off (silently, dont need to say ""right! turning it off!"") and turn it on again in a couple of streams.  In the mean time, moobot can tell you when people follow and you can just do a verbal thanks directly.  Do make sure you report them all to Twitch though so that they can be dealt with.  I occasionally go through spates where my channel gets hit, you just have to completely ignore it no matter what they're threatening that they can do - it's nonsense and designed to get a reaction."

Share on YouTube Join forums and network Keep showing the game off Show peole what's great about the game, avoid the dull bits Talk to the developers, maybe you can get some freebies to do a giveaway Build your own community via social media (Facebook, twitter, twitch, youtube, steam etc) Be regular and predictable, tell people when you're going to stream and commit to actually doing that.  Do it as often as possible but try for at least 3 times a week to make it a more regular sight. Show things off that people might want to do themselves, maybe challenges where you show a way of doing it and then get your viewers to tell you how they have done it or how they would if they had the game. Get clued up on steam discounts and make sure you get the message out to your audience (social media!) when you hear of the game or dlc going on discount.  Don't just one-hit-wonder yourself on a forum, become part of the community (and definitely dont just self advertise) - be a productive and contributing member so that people want to find out more by joining your stream.

Twitch,3co09q,filmsushi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:35:02 2015 UTC,"Yup. Unless you reingest, the transcodes will be live.   Then it depends on the capacity after reingesting whether transcodes are handed over once again."

Run the stream on 1000-1200 bitrate 720/30fps and you should be fine. You can even try 60 fps and see if your cpu/connection can handle it."

Shame OBS can't dynamically up the bit rate so that I can take full advantage of it - but it's still useful for those that can't handle the 720p 30fps stream that I do normally (and there are a few).  Definitely a move in a fantastic direction, thanks Twitch!"
Twitch,3cm7g5,MattPeddlesden,2,Thu Jul 9 07:55:38 2015 UTC,You can change your bitrate in OBS without restarting your stream. I do it all the time.

Twitch,3cm7g5,MattPeddlesden,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:02:24 2015 UTC,"Ah - Yes you're right, you can change bitrate, but you can't change resolution or FPS without restarting.  I currently stream with my video source at 1920x1080 and then downscale to 720p, it would be great if I could simply jump that up to 1080p without restarting but then I am not sure if the protocol would actually permit the screen to change size mid-stream now I come to think about it.  Thanks again though!"
Twitch,3cm7g5,MattPeddlesden,0,Thu Jul 9 09:23:19 2015 UTC,Thats great but it's a silly way of doing it as you'll never really know if you have transcoding or not when you go live. Which means you might be pumping in a lower bitrate then you could if you had transcoding which would give you better quality of transcode.
Twitch,3cm7g5,magaman,0,Thu Jul 9 01:38:38 2015 UTC,"Once you go live once, you see that you can change the quality.... Thus seeing that for the next stream you may raise that bitrate!"
Twitch,3cm7g5,DailyProblem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:16:19 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works.... Transcoding to non-partners is made available when the servers aren't at capacity. Then the top 1200 broadcasters will get transcoding.  Whether or not you get it depends on you making it into the top 1200 and is determined new every stream.  For examle (All streams happened at the same time btw.... during the EU afternoon + evening): Monday I had transcoding kick in at around 40 viewers. Tuesday didn't get it at all despite hovering around 30-39 concurrents all stream. Wednesday I got it around 25 viewers.  So yeah tl:dr if there are spots open transcoding is made available to the top 1200 streamers. Those ""requirements"" change every day so you can never be sure whether or not you get transcoding."

Twitch,3cm7g5,magaman,-1,Thu Jul 9 12:58:00 2015 UTC,"That argument is flawed. I have a friend who streams regularly on a schedule who doesn't get the quality button until he reaches +50 continuous viewers for ~20minutes, then it magically appears. Also he just recently received the quality option which came as a surprise to all of us. So it really only works with the assumption of ""If I get 50 viewers, which I'm sure I will, I will have the quality option which means depending on that I will adjust the bitrate""."
Twitch,3cm7g5,ggROer,2,Thu Jul 9 03:43:43 2015 UTC,"With Xsplit you can change your bitrate while live. You don't have to restart your stream, so the argument is not flawed.  No idea if other streaming software can do this as well."

The underlying HTML5 video playback works great and we've been testing it internally for a few months. The problem is that we do EVERYTHING in Flash right now, so we have to port every feature one-by-one into HTML/JS before we can release the player. We also can't completely remove Flash, because browser support for MSE is still missing for Firefox and older Safari/IE browsers.  So, we decided to split the HTML5 player into two releases: 1) move the UI into HTML/JS and 2) move the video into HTML/JS. The new player UI, is pretty swanky and we'll start rolling it out to users in a few weeks. You'll notice the new HTML interface immediately but the underlying video player will still be Flash.  After that gets released we can fully focus on the HTML5 video element and release an alpha. I don't have any dates for it but I personally want to release something asap (even with the current bugs). It's unoptimized but still uses a third of the cpu and a fraction of the memory compared to our current Flash player. I'll try to keep you guys updated."

Twitch,3cjgia,reohh,5,Wed Jul 8 12:10:17 2015 UTC,"This is quite possibly the biggest fallacy I see on this subreddit.  Yes, it is true that Safari is the only browser that natively supports HLS.

Twitch,3cjgia,J_ent,2,Wed Jul 8 13:04:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is true that other browsers can display the content using Javascript, or as most of us do, Flash. It should be obvious to anyone browsing Twitch that they are able to view streams -- but not using a native HTML5 implementation."

Additionally, while all browsers can and do support html5, the Javascript and html act differently on different browsers. I know first hand, I made and supported a twitch userscript called Monster Twitch which is what they eventually cooked in and called it theater mode. The same css can make something shine on one browser and completely destroy another. It took me months to make Firefox compatible with my script."

Twitch might very well transition over to MPEG-DASH, and that might be part of their transition to HTML5, but we don't know that yet.    If the browser supports W3C MSE, it should support MPEG-DASH. The following shows when the four most popular browsers added support for it:   Internet Explorer from version 11 on Windows 8. (2013 October) Google Chrome since early 2013, also on Android Safari 8 on OS X/iOS 8 (2013 October) Opera since 9 June 2015   Source: Wikipedia"

Twitch,3cn93h,DragonBorne28,3,Mon Jul 13 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"I stream using an IMac and I have no issue so it's possible your Mac is older and maybe slower but any new Mac is more then capable. There are not a lot of people that know the ins and outs of streaming on a Mac so they think it's hard to do, well that's simply false.   Macs are plenty powerful enough to stream from especially if your just pulling video from another device. I recommend having 16 gigs of ram and at least an i5 processor but that's mostly for the more advanced streamer anyways  Airserver works but there are a lot of applications that can really mess things up. For example, I noticed when I have 3 QuickTime videos looping, iTunes playing, teams peak on, my Java based bot running, and when I duel stream with Skype (not to mention safari open with the stream playing) I can get a little lag from air sever and from the lighting cable input.  To solve this I make sure I make video files only as large as they need to be. If I'm looping a video in the background I make sure it's just high enough quality to look good and no more. I make sure images aren't large for no reason (unless your streaming 4k you can compress a lot of images in your overlay) and I try to not use iTunes (major hog)   I also make sure my CPU utilization is ultra fast. If this still isn't working play with your bit rate. Anything south of 1000 will look like crap but if your in the upper 2000 you might want to lower it.   There are a lot of setting in OBS that I still don't understand so if others have info on that part of love to hear about it. Anyways I hope that helps."

To futher explain, there might be a channel rule that state ""No use of excessive caps"" and the channel moderators will interpret this as ""No caps, period"" and will t/o and ban anyone who uses caps regardless if it's excessive and the broadcaster doesn't really do much about it. I mean they can moderate their channel as they'd like, but when moderators -for lack of better words- take their job too seriously it's a big turn off for me because It makes me not want to chat at all because I'm afraid that I'd be timed out."

But he didn't say anything like that so I decided to play for real. (Which made me even more surprised when he did this.) ......

Twitch,3cnw9z,jeffthegamingllama,2,Thu Jul 9 10:57:29 2015 UTC,"talk, talk a lot. Even when there is zero viewers in your channel you should constantly be talking to yourself. I usually leave a channel if there is total silence for a minute after I've entered. People are there to be entertained, and unless you are a pro at the game you are playing, you have to entertain the viewers in other ways.  I think that is the best tip I can give any new streamers tbh. Poeple like Lirik even proves you can make it without a webcam as long as you are fun to watch."

Twitch,3cnw9z,LtRoyalShrimp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:31:57 2015 UTC,"OP, tips and all that stuff is out there on this sub. Merely posting a post that's like ""advice and tips please"" without any context to what kind of steam you are running out want to run is lazy. So I'm going to give you the following tip.   You won't survive with this kind of laziness. If you're truly interested in making headway streaming, gaining viewership, streaming because it's fun, then you will never have success unless you're going to put in the legwork. Looking, reading, testing, learning and thinking are the tips I can offer. Look for ways to improve your stream, both in the technical aspects and as a personality. Read everything you can about streaming. There are so many resources here and elsewhere (recently I've enjoyed Brotatoe's streaming 101 posts) that provide technical and content insights left and right. Test. Make a burn channel and run tests on quality and settings. Or do it on your normal channel, some people like to see you're working on being better. Learn. Really take a moment to absorb the information you read and the information you figure out on your own. When you have an experience (good and bad), take some time to digest it, boil it down to the important parts and absorb that. Bad experiences are amazing learning opportunities. And finally, think. Really think about what you want, what you need to do to get that, and how you're going to go about it. Have a plan. Share the plan. When people know you're going to stream 24 hours a day until you raise 9 gazillion doll hairs for charity, they hang out to see if you can. If people know you're streaming daily until 1/2 a bazillion followers, they'll come back regularly to see if you're doing it. Make a plan, share the plan, and follow through.   tl;dr: you'll never make it off you rely on tl;dr"

Twitch,3cjty4,Xzapo,6,Wed Jul 8 13:51:06 2015 UTC,"Given that he wears a beanie all the time, I always just assumed that he has a good set of in ear monitors similar to what professional musicians use.    Shure SE315    The only other thing I can think of is that he has a really nice XLR microphone hooked up to a really good mixer and some killer software for an effective noise gate so that it doesn't pick up some speakers that he may be using.  I'm not an expert, but I know a little bit about audio equipment."
Twitch,3cjty4,The_Bob_Evans,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:09:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured it was more about good equipment than anything.  It's amazing what you can accomplish with an XLR mic and a decent mixer.  Thanks for chiming in!  You obviously know much more about this stuff than I do."
Twitch,3cjty4,The_Bob_Evans,3,Wed Jul 8 21:15:21 2015 UTC,"ive got my mic set up the same way, the jist of it is: LOTS of playing with audio balance and noise gate.  there really is no other straightfoward answer except you wanna try to balance your mic levels low enough where its still reasonable + noise gate to filter out any feedback from the speakers that would otherwise bleed through.  and even then, i am still nearly constantly adjusting my speakers during super loud parts of a game.   basically, its a giant pain. i only do it because i absolutely 100% refuse to use a headset"

Twitch,3cjty4,distortednet,2,Wed Jul 8 16:26:35 2015 UTC,"Long (very broad topic) story short, it depends on streamer's setup, mostly on the microphone they use, audio volumes and space.    For example, with cardioid mic (like AT2020, NT1-A or Blue Yeti [with cardioid mode]) you will record only sounds coming from the front, in this case, it's streamer's voice. Speakers would be behind the mic and unless they are very loud, close to the mic with too much gain or there is a wall just behind your back where sound could bounce back into microphone, it won't pick up sounds from the speakers.    In addition to that, microphone should be mounted on a tripod stand or arm and caged, so it won't pick up vibrations etc. Putting speakers on the ground isn't a direct solution, it may help with omnidirectional and stero mics (broader polar pattern), because sound will be further from mic and on different level."
Twitch,3cjty4,Belar_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:56:03 2015 UTC,Cohh uses the following Mic.   http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-seiren  He has it positioned just right and has the noise gate and gain adjusted just right.  I think there is some Razer software that he has that helps with it too.  I've never seen him use headphones of any kind.  I'm a sub of Cohh's and watch him everyday during work.  Quality stuff right there.

Twitch,3cjty4,XhoK,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:23:24 2015 UTC,"Just theorizing here. His mic is USB, so it isn't going into a mixer and getting mixed with the game audio. This would allow him to mess with the delay on the microphone  in OBS to reduce the echoing effect.  In addition to that, the Razer software could also have echo reduction features."
Twitch,3cjty4,S1ayer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:20:27 2015 UTC,You can do this with any mic. I used to use my webcam mic and play game sounds through my speakers. You have to mess with the audio settings to make sure there's there's no no echo echo. Good luck!
Twitch,3cjty4,ruffyamaharyder,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:08:01 2015 UTC,Better audio gear. You'll need a mic which is directional so it only picks up sound on one side. I also use a compressor/expander/limiter which allows me to prevent ambient sounds from reach my mixer.
Twitch,3cjty4,magaman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked, but with my experiences with audio equipment I would assume that he has a studio mic and most of the ones I know of have some sort of function to reduce feedback."

Twitch,3ckfe4,Mabimi,4,Wed Jul 8 16:34:38 2015 UTC,Its not something very easy to stop. Some people do not even do the viewbotting itself. Some people use viewbots and test them out on streamers in hopes of getting them banned. These viewbots are coming from thousands of ips and thousands of accounts. Twitch does clear out the bot accounts when they can but when there are thousands upon thousands of accounts to filter through its not so easy to decide who is the viewbot. The best thing you can do is report the person. (And it sounds like you have done that)
Twitch,3ckfe4,jamacanbacn,2,Wed Jul 8 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"Hi Mabimi, I've been noticing the massive influx of random russian streams lately too. Best thing we can do is give it a check and report them. Hopefully Twitch can do something about it."
Twitch,3ckfe4,Neverwish,2,Wed Jul 8 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"Like many have said, there is no real way to find the point of origin.  Is the streamer doing it to himself?  If we get viewbotted we end our stream.  It's the only way to show the community we are 100% against it, and obviously not doing it to ourselves.  We only stream 2 hours a day--ending our stream because of a viewbot attack--kills us.    But if more people took such a strong stance against viewbotting, maybe they actually would die out."
Twitch,3ckfe4,linkwall,2,Wed Jul 8 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"You'll get trolls who will viewbot you just to end your stream, just saying. Twitch says restart your stream once, so apologise to your viewers and say you'll restart the stream."
Twitch,3ckfe4,keremimo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:55:59 2015 UTC,"It is extremely frustrating Mabimi, but you seem to be doing an awesome job with 50-150 so congratulations. :) I hope to be like you some day (although I play different games)!  I've been viewbotted myself before and I have to say it's extremely annoying. Some viewers notice it and most hate it, so hopefully that's the case for those at the top of the list. Nonetheless, just don't let it get to you. Keep doing your best and you'll get there!"
Twitch,3ckfe4,xyeLz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"I was view-botted the other day and was mildly concerned it would get my account banned. I usually sit at about 25 viewers and was at close to 100 the entire night. It's a scary thing, especially when there's nothing you can really do about it. Kinda ironic given that I couldn't so much as figure out how to use OBS without a detailed video. When I emailed Twitch about it, they basically say ""well ban the accounts that benefit from this"". Which technically would have been my account, so that's doubly frustrating.   Being on the flip side of it (where your ""competitors"" are view botting) is equally frustrating, I'm sure.  In general, I wish there was a better way for Twitch to flush these people out, but I'm sure it's difficult."

But if someone is cheating to inflate their numbers then what good is a sub button going to do for them? A sub button doesn't magically make a stream good or even popular. I've been in some channels with a sub button where the viewers never got above 50 and the person only has like 1500 followers."
Twitch,3ckfe4,justmeandmyself10,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:16:41 2015 UTC,Until a few days ago the reason why i wanted the partnership was mainly because of the qualitybutton.

Twitch,3ckfe4,Elementalstorm,0,Wed Jul 8 18:27:04 2015 UTC,I hate to say this is a thing that is becoming used more often and not going away just yet. I see the same thing happen with some PS4 streamers that get partnership as well. It's very frustrating for someone who busts there but putting 110 percent in there stream.   The best advice report it and just keep plugging away it will be a slower process to get partnership but it will happen.  -ES
Twitch,3cmdrr,dick_wool,2,Thu Jul 9 01:05:27 2015 UTC,if it's from something like deviant art then ask the artist for permission
Twitch,3cmdrr,catdragonnamedrose,2,Thu Jul 9 01:17:00 2015 UTC,"The large majority of images that can be found on ""Google Images"" do not include any information in regards to the usage rights, meaning that without a ""little"" research you will never know if you have the correct permission to use the image. The best thing to do is to either find the owner of the image you like or find an image on websites like flickr and Deviant then ask the owner for permission to use the image.   Short version, is that if the owner requests for it to be removed they have every right to. But Twitch doesn't have the staff to go through every image submitted. Want to keep a clean stream?

Twitch,3cm5u6,floppyquill,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:53:38 2015 UTC,I have OBS so I will have to give that a shot at some point too. I had a free three months to Xsplit so I figured I would use it. I have read that OBS has had problems in the past with my capture card. Do you know any reason other than it being free that people use OBS over Xsplit?
Twitch,3cm3z2,J_Glorious,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:46:58 2015 UTC,For fonts I'd recommend just going on dafont.com and choosing the look of a fontface you like the most - I tend to prefer the ones in the comic section that are easy to read
Twitch,3cm2rq,FadedSlowBro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:37:24 2015 UTC,I tend to tell people to tweet them to me or send it to my Twitch inbox. Clears chat up and makes people aware I have Twitter.  If its bugging you just ask them to stop spamming it or you'll have to ban links all together. I'm sure they'll understand
Twitch,3cm2rq,floppyquill,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:25:25 2015 UTC,"Some of them don't have twitter, so I guess I'll have to use the voice of reason to do with it."
Twitch,3cm2rq,drewlinskii,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:33:49 2015 UTC,"Since you're using AnkhBot, you can incorporate something called 'Auto Permit' and (assuming you have a points system) and have it set to have your viewers have a minimum amount of points to put a link in chat, or set a reasonable amount of points that your viewers need to hit to become a regular member, and set the 'Auto Permit' to Regular, to let regular viewers you trust post links, and to avoid trolls that want to post malicious links."
Twitch,3cjb7c,ThisIsAitch,10,Wed Jul 8 10:30:04 2015 UTC,"With XSplit Broadcaster you can.  Right-click on the scene you want to edit from the main window, and a preview window will pop up, which will allow you to edit one scene (with a preview of it) while using another."
Twitch,3cjb7c,pxmonkee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:38:04 2015 UTC,Yep! Really useful for those times you play a game you weren't expecting. Makes the layout change more professional
Twitch,3cjb7c,MSgtGunny,3,Wed Jul 8 21:29:12 2015 UTC,"In OBS you can preview stream and then edit scene. You can save multiple scenes and swap between them during streaming. So basically set up for me is I have ARK, Final Fantasy 7, Fallout 3, and my speed run for Cadash all saved in the scenes. Whenever I want I just swap between them. With an ""On Break"" scene saved you can swap to the break scene and get the game loaded etc then swap to the new scene and be good to go."
Twitch,3cjb7c,Cyrus9586,2,Wed Jul 8 10:38:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with OBS you really have to think about what you need scene-wise before you start broadcasting, or be OK with viewers watching your scene-building process :P  EDIT: Clarification - before broadcasting. Set up all the scenes you'll need before going live (using preview), or edit scenes in real-time. I think OP wants to know if you can have one scene active (being streamed) and preview another scene before switching to it on the broadcast.  Cheers!"
Twitch,3cjb7c,Robosphinx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:04:04 2015 UTC,no you preview (Not streaming) first and edit the scenes and have them set up and ready to go.  Swap to BRB load game swap scenes good to go.
Twitch,3cjb7c,Cyrus9586,3,Wed Jul 8 13:10:53 2015 UTC,"What he's saying is that you can't do it while streaming. That's what the question is about; being able to edit a scene that you are not currently using, while you are live.  Note that he pointed this out by saying you need to have everything ready before you start [streaming] otherwise the audience will have to see you build the scene."
Twitch,3cjb7c,OrenjiNikku,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:31:48 2015 UTC,Title of post confused me slightly. When he said without it being live I thought he meant without the scene being live. My mistake if the other way was implied.
Twitch,3cjb7c,Cyrus9586,2,Wed Jul 8 13:35:52 2015 UTC,Actually I was a bit confused at first too. Also you are right that he meant without the scene being live. A clearer way to say it might be saying the broadcast is live but the scene to be edited is not 'active'.
Twitch,3cjb7c,OrenjiNikku,0,Wed Jul 8 13:42:12 2015 UTC,"i think that this feature is quite important, althought it won't be used as often as. kinda the same as medicine."

Because on PS3 there's no party chat per se, but potentially if you're in a group in a specific game the elgato should be picking up that chat.

Twitch,3ckvsl,floppyquill,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:36:34 2015 UTC,What helps for me is to invite friends to the stream and have them chat or play with me. It's a lot fun and often leads to hilarious moments.
Twitch,3ckvsl,thesugap,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:54:25 2015 UTC,"My commentary varies because I speedrun games , so the commentary I provide is extreme knowledge about a game. I know why certain things occur within the game and explain how I exploit them. I usually say things like "" Chapter 4 is going to consist of some optimized movement aswell as some skips that I can hopefully attempt to get first try."" While attempting these things I attempt to vocalize what I am thinking. Which typically ends up being me just saying things like ""I am bad"" . One thing I find with talking to yourself is making sure you are comfortable. While alot of streamers say they are comfortable while streaming , they are lying to themselves. You should be able to talk to your chat just like having a conversation with someone in real life. There are some points in my speedruns when there are cutscenes that I have to sit through. Usually during those points I will bring up something I saw on twitter or ask people in chat what is going on. Also if you have people chatting it up don't think you need to continue talking about what you are doing, take the time to respond to them and get into whatever they are talking about. It is a community experience."

Use Twitter and Facebook to your advantage. Get to know other streamers and their community's.   Don't call out a lurker, ever. If someone comes in chat let them say hey.

Twitch is about entertainment for the most part. Unless you're at the top of your game, you need to focus on being entertaining.  Last thing. Please, never ever, and I mean never.

I'm new to streaming, and have only been going for a week, but I can see some things that throw me off from you stream as a viewer.   I wouldn't point out viewers unless they chat. It kind of makes them feel awkward. It's like going to a party, and as soon as you walk in someone's like ""LOOK WHO'S HERE"" Lol. Just let people lurk. I would highly suggest getting a schedule set up. It's cool that you stream whenever you're playing, but having a schedule is important. People like stability. You need to work on your panels. You can put panels like ""what rank are you?"" and ""how do you pronounce your name?"" into one FAQs panel. I don't play CS:GO so I don't know if in game settings are that frequently talked about, but me as a lurker doesn't care (not to be harsh). Two things you should add to your stream. 1) A bio. Just make an About Me panel that gives the people a basic idea of who you are, and what you want your channel to be about. 2) Facecam is big on Twitch. People like to see who they're watching, and it helps the viewer kind of ""relate"" to you a little more. I like the idea of if you rank up, and if you de-rank, but there is no way for people to know that from your channel. If that's something you're doing, make sure they know. Make a panel for it.   I hope this has helped you man. I sadly was not able to watch, due to the stream refreshing ever 5 seconds. What is your bitrate? I know I've read and people have told me 80-90% of your upload speed."
Twitch,3cibr4,ShinyGoombah,2,Wed Jul 8 03:55:16 2015 UTC,"I have my bitrate at 1750, I do have an overlay that I made that is facecam ready, but my webcam won't be here for another few days"
Twitch,3cibr4,floppyquill,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:59:01 2015 UTC,What is your upload speed? Do you know? 1750 seems pretty high. I have mine at 850 with an upload speed of 1.1mb/s and I still get some lag on my stream at points.
Twitch,3cibr4,CrisuKomie,2,Wed Jul 8 04:00:28 2015 UTC,5mbps up and 45mbps down
Twitch,3cibr4,MeKick,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:02:57 2015 UTC,"Ok. Well, your upload speed is most definitely not the issue. Lol. I would consider lowering your bitrate anyways though. I just saw someone mention this on another post that your bitrate to upload speed may be fine, but where you are not partnered, and you don't have transcoding it's a struggle for people (like myself) to watch your stream if they're internet can't keep up.  It's extremely unfortunate for you as a streamer, because that means your quality will be lower, but it will be better for keeping viewers."
Twitch,3cibr4,floppyquill,3,Wed Jul 8 04:09:37 2015 UTC,No need to lower that bitrate at all. 2000 is the sweet spot and this is lower than that.
Twitch,3cibr4,Tazeredfrog,0,Wed Jul 8 04:54:38 2015 UTC,This right here.  20200 kbps is the norm for non partnered streamers at 720p 30fps

It's like going to a party, and as soon as you walk in someone's like ""LOOK WHO'S HERE"" Lol. Just let people lurk.   To be honest, I wouldn't quite say I necessarily agree with this, both as a streamer and a viewer. Yes, I understand that a number of people have argued that it's better to let lurkers participate in chat when they want to do so.  However, it doesn't hurt to have someone greet you on your way in or ask how you're doing. I see the whole ""LOOK WHO'S HERE"" in a slightly different manner. In fact, I find that it can be pleasant to have someone tell you what's going on in the game that you're playing so that you're up-to-date.  Overall, I've felt many times that some lurkers are willing to join a discussion and end up enjoying the stream more if the streamer takes the initiative to try and reach out to them."
Twitch,3cibr4,AvalonAngel84,5,Wed Jul 8 04:04:34 2015 UTC,"As a lurker myself. Getting greeted feels awkward as hell! If I want to chat, I will. Im a lot more likely to respond to something the Streamer says about the game, than a welcome when the view counter goes up or worse, is someone sees my name in the viewer list."
Twitch,3cibr4,MeKick,2,Wed Jul 8 04:53:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hate being called out when I look at very low viewer streams. I entered to check it out, if I'm enjoying it and want to interact, I'll speak in chat. A lot of the time I just have streams on for a background noise while doing something else on the computer.  I noticed earlier tonight when I was changing some BTTV settings that there's a new 'Anon Chat' feature which lets you join channels without joining chat. It's freaking awesome, and it'll allow the larger streamers to be able to watch other streams without being called out the second they enter the stream."

Twitch,3cibr4,MeKick,0,Wed Jul 8 07:47:37 2015 UTC,"I can totally understand that it can be awkward to get greeted (although admittedly, none of my viewers have ever complained about that at all). However, my argument is more relative to THIS over anything else:   Don't call out a lurker, ever."
Twitch,3cibr4,floppyquill,2,Wed Jul 8 05:24:26 2015 UTC,"(although admittedly, none of my viewers have ever complained about that at all)   The thing lurkers do is lurking. If I get called out, I leave. I lurk, I don't want to interact with you, why should I stop lurking to complain to you? My first impression was already bad, no need for me to stay nor to complain.  I don't even call out lurking regulars. I see some everyday and never seen a line of text from them. But do I call them out? No. There must be a reason that they join a low viewer channel and lurk."
Twitch,3cibr4,MeKick,3,Wed Jul 8 09:56:14 2015 UTC,"After years and years on the site, if theres one bit of advice I hear all the time, its never call out a lurker.  If someones sat chilling and not talking, then let it be. You call that person out, most of the time they will go. The second they chat, go fucking ham and greet away. But respect the lurkers."
Twitch,3cibr4,floppyquill,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:32:17 2015 UTC,"if theres one bit of advice I hear all the time, its never call out a lurker.   I've been on Twitch for roughly a year now, and prior to today, I've only heard of this ""bit of advice"" once. Perhaps we are on two different ends of the site, but what I perceive seems vastly different from what you perceive.   You call that person out, most of the time they will go.   So if you're on someone else's stream and they say to you, ""hi, how is it going, floppyquill?"", would you turn 180 degrees and walk out?"
Twitch,3cibr4,xyeLz,2,Wed Jul 8 05:38:34 2015 UTC,"If I type in chat and someone responds of course I'll chat away, thats the point. If I haven't said a word and someone calls me out, especially by name, yeah I'd leave.

Twitch,3cibr4,WSUJeff,2,Wed Jul 8 06:28:21 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I disagree here with Kick (no offense kick!). I think it's creepy and awkward to say hello to people who aren't chatting. They aren't chatting for one reason or another and it's maybe a 5% chance that you saying hello to them they will respond. As a matter of fact, I joined a friends of mine channel the other day and didn't say anything. 2 seconds later he said ""Hey Mike."" I was actually a little weirded out and I just wanted to lurk at that moment.  I find it better to do this. If you notice that there are 1 or 2 new people watching, say something like ""Well hey everyone, thank you all for coming to watch! I really appreciate you being here and helping me grow! Please let me know if you have any questions about me or the stream!"" This way you're not singling out anyone."
Twitch,3cibr4,xyeLz,2,Wed Jul 8 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"no offense kick!   None taken, but thank you for your consideration. :)  Here's what I say to your observations.   They aren't chatting for one reason or another   Yes, but just because someone isn't chatting doesn't necessarily imply that they don't want to.  In the past, I have found some people that show up to chat who have had many pressing questions on their mind, whether they be for the streamer or the gameplay. However, they're often unwilling to ask those questions for fear that they might be stupid questions, or because it just seems weird to be all like ""oh, what is this game about?"" when you're not entirely too sure what's going on.   maybe a 5% chance that you saying hello to them they will respond   From where do you draw the 5% statistic?   I find it better to do this. If you notice that there are 1 or 2 new people watching, say something like ""Well hey everyone, thank you all for coming to watch! I really appreciate you being here and helping me grow! Please let me know if you have any questions about me or the stream!""   But yes, I can totally agree with this, though."
Twitch,3cibr4,MeKick,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:23:43 2015 UTC,You're right. It really does depend on the viewer.

I just checked out your stream and there was no webcam. I won't watch a stream without a webcam unless it's a pro match and there's commentators on it.   I also watched for ~5 minutes and when you were talking there was a fair amount of calling out your teammates for sucking and dropping a lot of console command jokes. I guess it depends on what kind of viewer you're going for but for someone who's not super involved in CS since 1.6 or something it might not appeal to them if they don't know what you're talking about or if they don't get the jokes. Just my $.02. Good luck man, just trying to figure out if I want to stream myself."
Twitch,3cibr4,Rendhammer,2,Wed Jul 8 15:51:14 2015 UTC,I'm with Jeff. I don't watch any streams without a webcam.

I just wanted to point out that while facecam does help a lot of viewers ""connect"" to streamers, it is not a be-all and end-all solution! I have seen some webcam streamers play a game they don't even look remotely interested in AND give mundane, one-line answers to questions asked by the chat.  A facecam will help, but naturally I would recommend you continue interacting with your chat on a regular basis."
Twitch,3cibr4,Rendhammer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:28:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I contradicted myself a bit. I wouldn't have watched for as long as I did if the guy wasn't looking for feedback."
Twitch,3cibr4,MeKick,2,Wed Jul 8 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"To add-on to what ShinyGoombah said and enforce a few things - greeting or shouting out new viewers is often seen a big no-no. Some people disagree, most agree. I never call out lurkers. Lurkers are a HUGE part of what viewing is all about. You are essentially closing yourself off from a large chunk of people by calling them out.  Activate Past Broadcasts. You have no highlights or anything archived, no one can watch what you do unless you are live.  If you are looking to gain more viewers, something many people say often is stay away from the big games. CSGO, LoL, DOTA2, Hearthstone, etc. You are at the bottom of thousands of people, it is going to be very difficult to find you.  You may want to add something as an offline image. Preferably something that has a schedule on it.  That's what I can advise based on your info, without seeing any actual content."
Twitch,3cibr4,FanaticDreamer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:52:15 2015 UTC,"most agree.   Might I ask what you base the statement ""most"" off of?"

Twitch,3cibr4,MeKick,2,Wed Jul 8 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"You have to keep streaming. If you gain a viewer a week, consider that mission accomplished. Growth doesn't happen over night unless you're very lucky.  Here's an example for you - I'm at 238 followers after half a year of streaming. And that's because of a daily stream I did for most of the time, marathons, and friends who raided/hosted me. I get 10-15 viewers a stream and I consider myself lucky.  You have to plan out things and know how to get yourself out there. Frequent streams, make friends, and be consistent. Have a schedule - play a variety of games."

Twitch,3ckmxg,TheXseption,2,Wed Jul 8 17:34:46 2015 UTC,"You will not be able to stream music as Monstercat does without exclusive and direct permission from Twitch. Streaming music with no live performance is against the ToS.    As far as I know, the waves on the stream are a plugin for a program that detects frequencies in the song. The songs played are queued up in a list and are left to play 24/7. The 'Now Playing' is probably just reading from an API of some sort.  Also, you will need to remove the channel names from the end of this post to prevent it being removed by the moderators. Add them to your flair instead :)"

No. The broadcasting of radio-style music-listening shows is an experimental program and is currently reserved on a very limited basis for approved music labels.  If you have the necessary rights and meet the same criteria listed at music.twitch.tv for contributing music to the Twitch Music Library, you can apply for special authorization from Twitch.    I assume you don't have the necessary right since you don't seem to know how to even create a playlist."

Twitch,3ckiv1,floppyquill,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:15:12 2015 UTC,It will take stress off your CPU   I would like to clear up that using a PCIe capture card for streaming does not make a difference in terms of performance in OBS and does not magically take stress off of the CPU.
Twitch,3ckiv1,LtRoyalShrimp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:26:05 2015 UTC,Do either one of you have sources for this?   I've heard a lot of places mention that PCIe capture cards aren't nearly as cpu-intensive as non-PCIe cards.
Twitch,3ckiv1,LtRoyalShrimp,2,Wed Jul 8 17:36:42 2015 UTC,"Well, my source is that I work for Elgato Gaming, a capture card company. :)    What a PCIe card does do more often then not is have less delay than a USB capture card. USB capture cards, especially USB 2.0 capture cards have an inherent delay to them, albeit very small, since they encode the video before sending it to your PC."
Twitch,3ckiv1,floppyquill,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:40:05 2015 UTC,I've noticed a difference myself. Plus the significantly reduced delay is great.  Thanks for clearing that up though.

If you want 1080p30 or 720p60 then the Avermedia c127 game broadcaster HD is probably your cheapest option. The c027 is even cheaper, but only really does 720p well. I've been using capture cards for close to 8 years now for streaming, if you can do not get an external USB based capture card. They've gotten better over the years but are a step down from internal cards.   You don't have the best CPU, but could probably manage 720p30 on fast or faster. You'd probably have to use veryfast for 720p60."
Twitch,3ckiv1,LtRoyalShrimp,0,Wed Jul 8 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"Your CPU is the limiting factor.   Quad cores can be ok, but what does not help is the fact that it is a AMD CPU, which are known to have terrible IPC(Instructions per clock) and are not good for streaming.   That being said, with a capture card, you should be able to pull off a 720p30 stream, at a very faster or ultra fast X264 preset.   As for capture cards, I'm obviously biased when recommending the HD60. :D"
Twitch,3clsrh,johnnystormx,3,Wed Jul 8 22:18:31 2015 UTC,"One way could be opening an incognito window or another way could be watching your own stream via another device(s) in your house.   It's technically viewbotting, and since your house uses NAT, all 3 or 4 viewers are actually from the same IP, which Twitch can see. :)"
Twitch,3clsrh,LtRoyalShrimp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:42:16 2015 UTC,That's very true. Unfortunately I think they could work around that by making different accounts to seem as if a different person in the house is watching the stream. Seems lame.

Twitch,3ck9mf,TatesTV,2,Wed Jul 8 15:52:49 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/TatesTV,  Here are the recommended specifications for a PC that is gaming/streaming or simply a streaming PC, or if you simply want to upgrade a part.   Each section will go a little bit into detail about why each component is important.     CPU:  You will want to go with the best CPU you can. Ideally that is where most of your PC build budget is spent. Due to how streaming works, the CPU is the most important part.   General recommendations for CPU's:    Any of the following or newer Intel Core i7 CPU's, with better ones in descending order.  Core i7 2600k Core i7 3770k Core i7 4770k Core i7 4790k Core i7 5820k Core i7 5930k Core i7 5960x     Ram:  Ram is not very important when streaming. Typically, when using a program like OBS, no more than 500MB will be used. Of course, this may very depending on the amount of source, plugins etc.   General recommendation for ram:    8GB DDR3 or higher     GPU: The GPU is the next most essential part of streaming. Popular programs like OBS, Xsplit and others perform actions on the GPU, like compositing, which is when the game video, webcam video, overlays, etc are all mixed into one picture, and scaling, which when your stream is converted from 1080p to 720p. Other actions include anti-alising, which can be applied after scaling to increase the quality, and other effects.   General recommendation for GPU:    Nvidia - Any GTX 650 series or higher (700, 900)  AMD - Any Radeon 6850 series or higher (7000, R7, R9)     Thats pretty much it. Other parts like the case, power supply, and hard drive is up to you, as they do not make a huge difference. If you will be doing lots of recordings and/or recording your streams, a 2TB or 4TB HDD would be beneficial to your build.   Cheers,  -Royal"
Twitch,3ck9mf,LtRoyalShrimp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:03:29 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for this detailed description and list of things. I am thinking about building a new gaming PC when Intel Skylake launches in August, so I will repurpose my current gaming PC. It seems like it would meet pretty much all the specifications. It has an i7-2700k, 24gb ram, and I have an old Amd 7850. The only thing I would probably need to upgrade would be get a better/bigger hard drive and a capture card if I go this route.   Again thank you for the detailed list and information it is greatly appreciated!"
Twitch,3ck9mf,Zenrer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:35:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say you'd need a bare minimum of an i5, an i3 probably wouldn't cut it, especially if you're aiming for 60fps. In terms of a GPU, if you get an i5, you don't need to buy one, because the i5 comes with integrated graphics, and you won't need a good GPU for encoding anyway.   Also, if you're using Fraps or DxTory to record as well, try to get an SSD, as a faster drive will help with the performance of Fraps or DxTory."
Twitch,3ck9mf,TwesterinoHD,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:03:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. Would you recommend using Fraps to record over OBS built in recording? I will start looking into an i5 build.
Twitch,3ck9mf,ZinniePlays,2,Wed Jul 8 16:47:30 2015 UTC,"you won't need a good GPU for encoding anyway.   False. OBS uses the GPU for doing any scaling(1080p down to 720p) and compositing on the GPU. A moderately fast GPU is still recommended.   Also, capturing and streaming at the same time on the same PC is VERY intense.   You can record the footage as a copy of the stream, to save resources, but obviosuly its a copy of the stream, including bit rate and resolution/fps."

Twitch,3ck58l,pillowman205,2,Wed Jul 8 15:21:18 2015 UTC,number of things.  does he have chat moving by super fast?  if so do a hey @username so it might highlight for him to see it.  if it's a lower viewer count and he's not acknowledging you send him a direct message on twitch just to see whats up if you've been a big supporter.  if anything just stop giving them a view if you feel they're being interactive with everyone but you.
Twitch,3ck58l,shark_juggler,2,Wed Jul 8 15:28:52 2015 UTC,"You should ask if you did something wrong, privately. There's no point in causing drama in chat - that'll just make problems worse, if there are any.  It's also possible he just misses your message.  Otherwise, if you're feeling like the streamer doesn't respect you - don't give him your patronage. Move on and find a streamer who will. There are hundreds of streams on Twitch with streamers who would be thrilled to have another dedicated viewer =)"

I hate to say it but sometimes I miss someone saying ""hello"" multiple times. I hate myself for it, but eventually I get to them. Whispering would really help. I would also make sure you are doing @streamersname so that it shows up in black for them.  Alternatively, you can switch streams as well! I'm always looking for new viewers and would love to greet you! :P Haha. But seriously, maybe he's annoyed at you for some reason? It's also possible he may have accidentally /ignored you?"

Twitch,3cjxog,djx1100,4,Wed Jul 8 14:22:38 2015 UTC,"To be honest. Unless you're a professional esports person, you're not going to get far without talking.   I'd suggest using push to talk, setting the mic to a keyboard, that was if there was noise around you, it would only come through the stream if you held the ""talk"" button down"
Twitch,3cjxog,floppyquill,2,Wed Jul 8 15:18:40 2015 UTC,You main gain a few people to just watch the game but in reality most Twitch viewers come for the entertainment of the streamer.

Twitch,3cjxog,Tapeworms,2,Wed Jul 8 15:36:48 2015 UTC,"I mean...watching a stream without any commentary would basically be just watching the game being played, which you could have more fun doing if you actually did it yourself."

Twitch,3cjltl,CjC_CS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:34:50 2015 UTC,You can speedtest.net and then go from there. If you are dropping frames it could be due to your rig as well (no information on it).  ISP could not like the communication to twitch servers. It is actually very common.
Twitch,3cjltl,Mad_Orbitz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:54:24 2015 UTC,"I have an i7 4790k and a nvideo 960 ssc, I think that I should be more than able to stream on this rig.   What do I do if they do not like the communication to twitch servers?"

Twitch,3cjltl,Deadsens3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:01:45 2015 UTC,"Yea as long as you are running @ 2,000mbs upload then you shouldnt be dropping any frames. I think you need to give your ISP a call and ask them what is going on. Also make sure your streaming to the nearest server to you on OBS or Xsplit.  Tell them you are live streaming @ 2% of my upload speed I pay for 10up and its a crappy service."
Twitch,3cjltl,Mimsy34,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:09:39 2015 UTC,They will start throttling you shortly after your data cap. That wont effect your fps on your end it may on the stream tho. In my experience you need to go over quite abit every month before they are going to do something about it. For example i had a 500gb per month plan and went over 2 months in a row to 680gb but didnt see any decrease from my isp.   Ps just buy more data :)
Twitch,3cjltl,RaN96,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:58:49 2015 UTC,"I mean its been 8 days into the month, and this has been happening 24/7 for the past 5 months or so, so I think that isn't the case, I have no idea, however. I will look into it."
Twitch,3cjltl,army12bc,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:00:03 2015 UTC,"it says that my isp (cox) will not slow down my internet if I exceed my data cap, so that can't be it."
Twitch,3cjltl,RamuneGaming,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:04:58 2015 UTC,"Cox throttles even though they say they don't. They were doing that to me last year. I had multiple technicians come out and look, even a supervisor, and they could never find anything wrong. Then, magically, it corrected itself after months of dealing with it."
Twitch,3cjlcl,Aldaz108,2,Wed Jul 8 12:30:23 2015 UTC,"The bitrate limit is the same no matter what codec you use. I would be surprised if you even got a decent picture with 4200, since NVENC usually requires much higher bitrates than x264, sometimes as much as 5x the amount in my experience--so a 720p/30fps stream will look best at roughly 3000kbps example with x264 and to match that quality, 15,000kbps example using NVENC.  Edit:  added links to sample videos.  Edit 2: this is using first-generation NVENC, which is found on 600 and 700 series GPUs. GTX900-series have a more efficient encoder that allows for slightly lower bitrates, but they are still not as efficient as x264."
Twitch,3cjlcl,Oremm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:31:36 2015 UTC,"Thats what I heard also, but when I've previewed the live stream on my laptop which I have running to see the chat and things and to see if everything is stable it's pretty decent, in games like GTA SA when turning slight pixelation but apart from that its HD.   I took a look at the ToS from Twitch, where does it mention about 3500 being the limit I could not find it?"
Twitch,3cjlcl,Oremm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:23:15 2015 UTC,"As long as you're satisfied with the results, the theoretical is irrelevant then!  Here is where Twitch have stated 3500 as the max.  Side note - you appear to be conflating resolution with picture quality.  The two are not the same thing.  Let's say you have 2 streams that both use 1500 as their bitrate. One of them is at 480p, and one of them is 1080p.  The 1080p stream is HD even though it looks horrible, the 480p stream is not HD even though it looks great.  All ""HD"" means is that the resolution (size of the image) is at least 1280x720."
Twitch,3cgq3v,hetojur,8,Tue Jul 7 19:52:56 2015 UTC,"It's an unfortunate side effect of the way Twitch optimizes its servers. They have to make sure the majority of the users have the best experience, and that chunk is concentrated on the biggest streams.  Programs such as Livestreamer or Tardsplaya can lessen those effects."
Twitch,3cgq3v,Neverwish,4,Tue Jul 7 20:22:34 2015 UTC,"Part of this is also on the streamer. If they aren't partnered and don't have transcoding they need to lower their own bitrate. It doesn't matter if the streamer has amazing upload speed, if their viewers don't have great download or are on mobile. They should be setting their bitrate to around 1600-1700 so both mobile and others can view their stream."
Twitch,3cgq3v,lulusoccer,2,Tue Jul 7 21:40:26 2015 UTC,I noticed this even on partnered streams myself. I normally can watch source but a few of the streams I watch are sub-100 at times and have to drop to medium to not have it hang.
Twitch,3cgq3v,pursuelubu,2,Wed Jul 8 01:00:11 2015 UTC,This was unfortunately a lesson I had to learn the hard way. It's not fun to have to intentionally lower the quality of your stream in such a way but my viewers pointed out the ridiculous buffering.
Twitch,3cgq3v,Unreg1stered,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:31:18 2015 UTC,Does the 1600-1700 bitrate go for pretty much any unpartnered stream? I had some viewers saying they were buffering plus a friend couldn't watch on mobile at all. How badly does this effect the quality of the stream?
Twitch,3cgq3v,Divinations_,2,Wed Jul 8 06:57:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, and it depends on what game you're playing. If you're playing something fast moving or with lots of vegetation (csgo/h1z1) reduce your resolution to 600p or 540p to try and make the picture look better."

Twitch,3cgq3v,joocrazymang,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:56:53 2015 UTC,The gap isn't as bad as you'd think. I only have 500 followers and average about 10 viewers but my quality and delay are 1000x better than they were when I started.
Twitch,3cgq3v,neoprophet,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:06:34 2015 UTC,"Twitch will prioritize the larger channels when it comes to server efficiency. That is why the top 1,200 channels will have access to the quality encoder. Smaller streamers should try to work around this by providing a broadcast at no more than 720p 2000 bit rate settings. Any more than that and you run the risk of having too high of bandwith usage for the average viewer.  It kind of sucks that we are not able to freely provide 60 fps or 1080p streams right out of the gate. If Youtube Gaming provides serious enough competition to Twitch, I hope that will get Amazon and Twitch to overhaul how many limitations are put onto us."

I think that's a small turn around though it may not be widely accepted.   Also, the scams are possible, but not common I believe. I haven't seen a scam help post on here with paypal in months.   Regarding the penalties, and charge backs, I have no idea. Hopefully someone with better knowledge will help you."
Twitch,3cj7f5,ShankAMuffin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:03:12 2015 UTC,"yea, it still happens. People will still always troll donate to get a reaction out of the streamer, and its fairly easy for them to get a chargeback months later.  The rule of thumb is to not touch any donation for 6months, and to pay back very large donations from random people that aren't your regulars. Its better to be safe than sorry.  Also the fees people are talking about are mostly overdraft fees. You may get a chargeback fee, but I've heard its pretty easy to dispute them."
Twitch,3cj7f5,ZinniePlays,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:03:21 2015 UTC,"I have also seen that putting something like ""Please note all donations are non-refundable."" under you donation button can help you prove to paypal etc that they were informed and may help thwart some charge backs. As well as upgrading to a free business account can also help against it. I have not confirmed this so I cannot say either way if it helps."

Twitch,3cj7f5,floppyquill,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:28:32 2015 UTC,"1) use a PayPal BUSINESS account ONLY.  2) In your PayPal settings, limit the amount that a donator can donate. A lot of people who donate thousands of dollars are obviously just trolling you and are going to do a chargeback. If you keep your donation limit to between say $5-25 then most trolls won't bother with it. However honest viewers who DO want to donate will usually donate within that amount anyway."

No issues with vibrations etc.  I got it for the same reasons you specify.  I was going to get a shockmount boom stand later but haven't felt the need to, I've had zero issues with this stand. Only thing I would say is make sure you position the mic over one of the tripod legs so it is balanced correctly if you have the arm extended far away as the Yeti is rather heavy.    http://www.amazon.com/Samson-MK-10-Microphone-Boom-Stand/dp/B003CLIPHO"

Twitch,3ciklg,SpazMan777,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:39:45 2015 UTC,"This is possible, with scripting magic. Although I also cannot fathom why you want to do this, the reason is irrelevant...  You can use mIRC (for the scripting) and vMix (for the notification).  I won't get into the nitty gritty details, but after banning someone using mIRC, it will send a notice to the local vMix server running on your PC to cause a notification with custom text to display.  In fact, what it really boils down to, is vMix.  Doesn't matter what does the scripting.  vMix will accept a notice from anything, including a web browser.  By the way, vMix is video broadcasting software.  It's similar to XSplit/OBS/etc. but is meant for television broadcasting.  It's significantly more advanced in some areas but severely lacking to be used as a livestreaming software."

Twitch,3cj2hf,Cyrus9586,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:35:54 2015 UTC,"Advice. Use social media a lot. Make friends with other streamers. Set a schedule and stick to it. Talk ALOT, think out loud, leave no dead air. And don't get disheartened if you don't have a lot of traffic for a while, its hard to get an audience.  Personal advice, avoid the number game. Don't watch your view counter and avoid your viewer list. You'll find streaming a lot more fun when you ignore the statistics.  Try to avoid play really popular games. Try and find a game where you'll be higher up in the list.   Most importantly don't forget its supposed to be fun, so kick back and enjoy streaming man!  Good luck :)"

I have had mine for almost 2 years and I still wish I would've gotten an AT2020 USB.  The shock mount and boom arms for the Yeti are outrageous compared to the options for an AT2020. You can buy an AT2020 for $100, then $29 boom arm+shock mount combo and you're good to go. The Yeti's proprietary spider mount is $60 and a boom arm capable of holding it's crazy weight is like $90, as you've said.  I wish I could trade my Yeti for someone's AT2020, because the options are much more affordable."
Twitch,3cfslm,The_Bob_Evans,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:00:41 2015 UTC,"I DID go with the AT2020 USB.  The mic, shock mount, boom and pop filter cost me about ~$150.  I would highly recommend this setup.  The Yeti is a good microphone that is versatile, and the AT2020 is a one trick pony.  That said, the AT2020 does that one thing better than the Yeti and it's perfect for streaming and video commentary."
Twitch,3cfslm,Enkaybee,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"$60 is a preposterously high price for a shock mount.  My no-name shock mount was $9 and I use it with this boom arm for $17.  I don't know whether it will fit a yeti (I have an AT2020), but I'm sure you can find similarly-priced items that will.  Keep in mind that if your mic is isolated from vibrations, you don't even need a shock mount."
Twitch,3cfslm,pendcollective_will,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:31:35 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of booms you can use for the Yeti.  It doesn't have a special sized thread, so even $19 stands will fit and be able to hold it.  I think the stand I'm using now was like $23.  Zero problem whatsoever.  Here's the link."
Twitch,3cfslm,Kusaji,0,Wed Jul 8 03:18:29 2015 UTC,"I personally would never recommend a yeti to even my worst enemy. They eventually just run into non-stop driver issues and stop working.

You will want either a Z97 or H97 depending on if you get the K version or not (Z97 if you do).  I would presonally recommend an ASUS motherboard but Gigabyte and ASRock are other good brands of mobos.  Youy will need the LGA1150 chipset for the processor.  your 650W power supply should be good enough for any one-card setup you have :)  if you dont already have DDR3 ram, be sure to get ram that has a cas latency of 7 at 1600 MHz.  Here's my recommendation for you for parts  Obviously if you dont need the DDR3 ram, take that off and put the money towards a K model and a Z97 mobo.  Let me know if you have any questions :)  BTW i added that cooler in because its decently low profile and way better than the stock intel cooler which sucks ass"

I found out my local Micro Center is having a huge sale on the i7-4790K and the ASRock Z97 PRO4 LGA1150 bundle (a total of $339.98 for the purchase!!)  So I ended up going with those because they costed less than the non-OC-ready build from online retailers.   I will definitely look into that cooler once I have the new setup up and running!

Surprisingly, lots of people don't have the bandwidth to watch streams with high bitrates (maximum for Twitch is 3500kb/s), and I'm going to assume you're not partnered, so you don't have any encoding options for your viewers.     If you play low-motions games (such as Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm) where large amounts of the screen remain static require considerably lower bitrates compared to high-motion games (CS:GO, etc). So streaming low-motion games at 720p @ 30fps will require bitrate of around 1700, for high-motions games you should be able to get 720p @ 30fps for 2500. If you lower your bitrate to suit whichever game type you play this should hopefully help with the issue of buffering for some viewers."

Twitch,3chlz5,catdragonnamedrose,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:44:37 2015 UTC,"Give us some details. Are you using obs, xsplit, or something else? Did you select to record and stream or did you just start streaming through the application?"
Twitch,3chlz5,IAmSpaceGhost,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:47:55 2015 UTC,OBS and i streamed and recorded though OBS
Twitch,3chlz5,PeekingBoo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:51:13 2015 UTC,You can click File > Open Recordings Folder or something like that and it'll take you right there :)  Otherwise going into your settings and looking where you're specifying the recordings to be saved is your next best bet.
Twitch,3chlz5,PeekingBoo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:26:54 2015 UTC,i don't understand. What file? the streams are saved as a file that you can't view because it's a .flv file. I don't see anywhere in settings where recorded stuff is saved i see the stream folder but i'm going to assume those are two different things because streaming and local recording are two different things.

Some how I got a lot of Hispanic viewers and some of them don't speak much English so, most of the time I am speaking both languages since they keep talking in Spanish. There are still mean trolls who will make fun of my accent and sometimes I wish I started my streaming talking just in Spanish but I have really amazing English speakers viewers too so I try not to take it personal. I have learnt many slangs English words since I've started streaming too. Maybe you can try streaming one day in English and other day in your language and see which one you like the best."

Twitch,3cg4ok,eax_angwer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:03:02 2015 UTC,"Technically the answer is no, but you can be banned for ""raiding"" channels as it is now considered harassment. So if you promote your channel without someones permission, they can report your channel and have viewers report your channel as well and you might get banned. I've seen it happened a couple of times before and as a streamer myself, I don't even hesitate to report someone who comes into my stream promoting themselves."
Twitch,3cgyix,inthe6,2,Tue Jul 7 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"I've had this same thing happen before. Some guy I knew for 3 years even personally told me in teamspeak he can make the viewbots talk every now and then. Report him almost every stream he's done the past year (he streams often with viewbot) and nothings done about it. I guess Twitch handles viewbotting differently.    Viewbotting your self is a way to get actual viewers and then you can turn it off once you have a general followship.    For now the only thing you can do is ignore it and move on, report the stream and live your life."
Twitch,3cgyix,DoPlusSee,-1,Tue Jul 7 21:02:06 2015 UTC,"Yup. It's basically this user's plan to viewbot their way to #1 when I'm not streaming or #2 when I'm streaming and then build off that.  they were getting 5-20 viewers max until about a week ago, spiking to over 180-300, but with literally still 5-30 people in the viewer list with literally noone talking."
Twitch,3cgyix,Kyente,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"I think everyone is right here, just leave it. I have seen quite a few streamers who show definite signs of botting and after spending 5 minutes in their stream you can tell that they will never gain a following based on the quality of their stream. Hell, botters can get partnered before me because end of the day, I love being able to talk to real people and not pretend I have people watching me."

BTW I bloody Love HoN so props to you for being a HoN streamer!"
Twitch,3cgyix,luckyariane,-8,Wed Jul 8 07:56:01 2015 UTC,"Ignore it, since it absolutely does not affect you in any way whatsoever and you are wasting your time by even thinking about it. Just stream your game."
Twitch,3cgyix,Zweihander98,3,Tue Jul 7 21:36:01 2015 UTC,"Not really. Viewers are drawn to who is the most popular, especially in a game with less than 15 streamers at the most popular times."

Besides, you said even with viewbots he's not overtaking you in ranking for the game you're playing, so it's affecting you in particular even less."
Twitch,3cgyix,RufusMcFly,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:19:25 2015 UTC,"But think about viewer retention, when people join, see no one is talking and the stream is not that good. Surely they will back out and try another. I don't know man I think you're worrying a bit too much."
Twitch,3cgyix,spla08,0,Tue Jul 7 23:17:59 2015 UTC,"With less than 15 streamers on the game, I wouldn't worry too much. It's not like you're being pushed down the rankings into oblivion. In my experience, most viewers are pretty savvy about a stream with 100+ viewers and no one talking."

It doesn't affect him, he shouldn't care, stop worrying about what other people are doing and just stream your game. Don't try to come up with excuses as to why his viewer count is low. It's not because someone else is view botting, it's because he's not interesting enough."

Twitch,3cf373,techandweary,6,Tue Jul 7 12:29:11 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'm really disagreeing with is the part where you say the GPU is the backbone for streaming. Streaming is way more CPU intensive than anything, so I believe that is where you don't want to cheap out on, not with the GPU."
Twitch,3cf373,ErrorByDefault,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:53:30 2015 UTC,"This is all dependent on what is being streamed, PC games? Well then obviously everythingish you said cuz pc lol. However if someone wants to stream any console and happen to have a ps4/XB1 all you need is an hdmi splitter(and if needed an hdmi to component/composite converter) and 2 twitch handles. One handle streams automatically from the xb1/ps4 the 2nd handle re-hosts the 1st but with your personal audio overlay and whatever other overlay you're interested in using. The other venue would be android/ios games which is even easier, all you need for that is a generic pc and mobizen ( www.mobizen.com ) which is a 3rd party app that captures mobile devices over usb. To add further to you OP, there are standalone capture cards that are usb that handle the bulk of the load; the real struggle though is having a good upload speed on your internet. By the way harbor freight is a great resource for cheap hardware which includes lighting (work lights)."
Twitch,3cf373,Therustedtinman,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:05:33 2015 UTC,"you can get a cheaper card like the r9 280 that will outperform the 960 or get like an r9 280x that is like $5 more and will definitely outperform the 960. Also from my experience streaming with a dual core isn't so great, even with an i3 4150 which technically has 4 cores, 2 hyper threading cores and 2 reg cores. So not sure about the GPU being the backbone."
Twitch,3cf373,akujeff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"It all depends on what encoder you use.  A lot of people use a CPU encoder because it can provide better quality, but if you have a decent GPU and a lower-mid range CPU, then you can utilize the GPU for encoding."

I now use a Avermedia 985 that passes through an El Gato HD 60. 0 Delay and the ability to capture 1080p60 for youtube :). Switched from the Hauppauge because I wanted 0 delay. The HD PVR 2 had a 2 second delay, so I always had to manually adjust my delay settings for my webcam and voice within my streaming program.

It comes with a cable for you to use for PS1-3, and then you have an HDMI out. Xbone you can do HDMI in though."

Twitch,3cfisz,Ketku_RiGhT,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:15:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about OBS, but XSplit has a setting that stores your broadcast locally at the same time it's streaming. (Edit: OBS also has this setting)  I use 3 monitors (one for the game, one for the chat and browser, one for all the background utilities and programs, XSplit, TeamSpeak, etc...). I also have the chat up in my stream so that if I make a highlight of something, or upload a video to YouTube, viewers will be able to follow an ongoing conversation I'm having with the live viewers, otherwise they would just be very confused."
Twitch,3cfisz,Neverwish,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:38:38 2015 UTC,I do local record my broadcasts using OBS. Having that file available makes it easier to work with the video in an editing software if I want to put highlights on Youtube later on.
Twitch,3cfisz,TheMrToodles,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:11:07 2015 UTC,OBS does this everytime you stream if you want it to. I have all my broadcasts recorded so any highlights i can easily cut up in premiere or whatever video editing software and post to youtube.

Twitch,3cf98k,Aldaz108,3,Tue Jul 7 13:29:07 2015 UTC,"Talking is a big key with streaming, people like to be interacted with. When you play games and such without talking it gets boring, some viewers have already played the game and just wanna feel and or see your reactions. This being said, a webcam helps a lot because if youre concentrating people can see that, but some big streamers don't have cams but they do talk. You gotta think, if I was some random person would I follow myself, I try to re-watch my streams and take notes on things I like and things I need to change. Hope this helps!"
Twitch,3cf98k,Mr_Rambles,3,Tue Jul 7 13:36:03 2015 UTC,"This is pretty common. And you've only been streaming for a little while. You've really gotta give it time. Its better than 0! Its very very rare for people to just skyrocket with viewers their first time trying. There are exceptions, and I'll admit I was one of them (not on this acct.), but for the most part, most people don't even get 1 viewer their first few weeks. It takes time.  Personally, I think webcams and mics are pretty important. Mics more so than cams. People watch streams mostly for that connection with the streamer and that's hard to have if they don't have a way to get a feel for who you are. If all people wanted was JUST gameplay, they could go to youtube."
Twitch,3cf98k,ErrorByDefault,3,Tue Jul 7 13:37:52 2015 UTC,Part of the issue is the 4200 bitrate. Viewers on lower end connections aren't going to be able to watch you at that rate. Even people that do stop by are gonna bounce pretty quick when it starts stuttering on them.
Twitch,3cf98k,iambgriffs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:41:24 2015 UTC,Do you have any recommendations of what bitrate(s) to stream at?
Twitch,3cf98k,Kablooey88,3,Tue Jul 7 14:08:04 2015 UTC,Most people recommend 2000-2500 for unpartnered streams.
Twitch,3cf98k,exorbiant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:10:15 2015 UTC,Why does being a partner make a difference for bitrate?
Twitch,3cf98k,Kablooey88,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:35:36 2015 UTC,"right now it doesnt, since the top 1200 get transcoding anyways. But without transcoding, people cant choose which bitrate to watch at, so you will end up losing some people without decent enough speed to handle the bitrate."
Twitch,3cf98k,ZinniePlays,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:49:33 2015 UTC,"ok, that makes sense.  I didn't know that we weren't able to stream at multiple bitrates anymore.  Thanks for the help!"
Twitch,3cf98k,Kablooey88,2,Tue Jul 7 15:37:05 2015 UTC,"Not using a mic is a huge thing... If you're extremely skilled at what you're doing, you might bring in people wanting to see really good gameplay. One of the things that makes Twitch so different from YouTube is live interaction with the streamer. It's hard for a viewer to communicate with someone who doesn't have a mic, and possibly a bit daunting to start up a conversation in the chat since they don't know if you're even watching chat. Secondly, giving it time is a huge part of Twitch. Just finding your niche on Twitch could take a while. Find what games you enjoy playing, and find how you're comfortable presenting yourself as a unique streamer! Thirdly, 4200 bitrate is higher than most partners stream. As someone who came from a crappy internet a few months ago, there were times when I just couldn't watch without the stream buffering every 5 seconds, making it unwatchable. A lot of people say around 2000 bitrate is a great starting point for non-partnered streams. If you lower your resolution, it can actually look better than some 720p streams. If you really can't live without the high bitrate, just know that there might be some people who came, couldn't load the stream, and left. Biggest thing is just to have fun with it, and make friends!"
Twitch,3cf98k,PumpkinMilkshake,2,Tue Jul 7 13:52:05 2015 UTC,I thought 3500 was the max bit rate twitch allowed or has that changed?
Twitch,3cf98k,dudester1981,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:38:58 2015 UTC,"Your channel might be suspended from that bitrate, max allowed is 3500 and even then, turn that down to 2000. Instead of hunting for pixels, eliminate boredom from your stream, be entertaining that's what people come for. If you get transcoders, turn it up to 3500 you can do it without restarting stream."
Twitch,3cf98k,keremimo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:37:47 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, I think your very high bitrate absolutely figures into this.  In general, bitrates between 2000 and 2500 are recommended for people without transcoding options (partners and now, popular streams during times Twitch has resources to spare).  While NVENC is nice due to a lower performance hit, it requires a fairly high bitrate compared to x264 to look good.  I wrote an article about bitrate and resolution you can read here, might help you find settings that work for you:  http://liftgaming.com/2015/02/the-best-bitrate-resolution-and-framerate-for-twitch/  As for getting over the initial slump that most streams have starting out, it's all about persistence and scheduling.  Also, always be looking for something you can improve.  I've been at it for 7 months full time and still have plenty to tweak and improve upon!  I wrote another article detailing my thoughts on growing your audience, you can read here: http://liftgaming.com/2015/02/growing-your-twitch-channel/  Finally, networking is a huge part of growth.  I believe Twitch is power in numbers.  Find a community you enjoy and become a part of it.  There's a few out there and there's this Subreddit as well.  We have a fun community over at Lift Gaming you could check out as well, scope it out and drop an intro if you like what you see:  http://liftgaming.com/forum/  Streaming takes time and dedication but it is worth it in the end because you'll have a ton of fun and meet a bunch of new people.  Best of luck in your endeavors!"

I thought my pc specs could more than handle streaming so I banged my head against a wall and did trouble shooting for a year, sent my pc back to cyber power twice. Then one day I read a post on a forum that suggested making sure all of my cores were un parked. I have a quad core processor and just assumed my os was using all of them. But, only one and rarely 2 were being used at any given time. Needless to say as soon as I un parked all of my cores my problems magically went away.

Also, just to clarify, when you stream, is the stream dropping frames or is the game dropping frames? The game dropping frames is normal, because of the extra stress on the CPU.

Twitch,3cf2je,marc765,0,Tue Jul 7 12:46:09 2015 UTC,Okay man :) Its the actual game that's dropping! I only have a 60hz Monitor so you're gonna bash me but yeah... I don't know why but as soon as I get 100fps something just feels.. off.   Like the mouse feels jumpy and overall just weird! I feel like as soon as I hit 200fps everything seems to be smooth.

It causes input lag, which does not feel very good.  OP needs to spring for a 144hz monitor.  Honestly, you sure you like 300fps with 60hz monitor?

We are looking into new methods because we understand not everyone wants to use PayPal but we are also trying to keep users safe .

Most, myself included, use a business paypal account instead of a personal one, because it allows you to set a business name and hide your real name and address. Very important.  Sure paypal takes a miniscule percent of each transaction, but whatchagonnado. Worth it for the security.  I use this in addition to TwitchAlerts, so about 4% gets taken out (1% by twitchalerts, 3% by Paypal). Sucks but they're businesses after all. Plus, I'm not gonna complain. Its tips. I dont get to choose how much I get in the first place from someone."

I have a verified PayPal, but I definitely don't want personal information leaking if I can help it.   Do I just create a separate, business account and transfer the funds between them?"
Twitch,3cert1,L-ove,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:56:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, the business account is a completely separate account. Its not linked in any way to your personal account."

Since I can't see your face, and you aren't really talking much when I come in..I'm just going to go find someone else.  Ask yourself - What is making me different from the other streamers out there? Are you actually putting on a show? Or are you just playing a game and hoping people peer over your shoulder to watch?  To me, streaming needs to be a production. People tend to reference old, original streamers as cases that ""I can succeed if I just do what they do.""..It just isn't the case. You need to be more entertaining then the next guy."
Twitch,3cc4x3,Failstar,5,Mon Jul 6 19:48:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean I pretty much knew that was a major problem in my stream. Like I said in my post I just find it hard when my channel is empty and I'm doing like an 18 hour stream farming stuff for hours. I need to try and fix this - thanks for taking a look.
Twitch,3cc4x3,Failstar,16,Mon Jul 6 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"Well and thats the trick, it is really hard.  At this point in the Twitch lifecycle, you actually need to be slightly crazy to catch someones attention because you always need to be talking to yourself. Constantly."
Twitch,3cc4x3,Kablooey88,2,Mon Jul 6 19:53:19 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, did my first stream last night playing blackjack, had 1-2 views for the first 30 min, then I started talking to myself every hand I was dealt and more people started coming in and staying. Ended up 10 follows on my first day!"
Twitch,3cc4x3,EDGAR_SEC,11,Tue Jul 7 13:58:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know how many people would want to watch someone farm stuff in an MMO for hours on end. I'd say only stream ""interesting"" gameplay. Quality > quantity."
Twitch,3cc4x3,EDGAR_SEC,2,Mon Jul 6 20:20:13 2015 UTC,"True - I have read some top Twitch streamers say exactly this, that you need to have entertaining game play and just just ""farming"" or ""leveling"". I guess when it comes time for me to play a game even though I know I'm about to farm wood for hours I figure it is better to stream then not to. I think I should start looking more into what I'm streaming. Thanks for the helpful advice!"
Twitch,3cc4x3,gagsy92,3,Mon Jul 6 20:25:47 2015 UTC,"I always thought of it like this:   You only have one shot to make a first impression. If they happen to see you doing boring stuff, then they will automatically assume you're a boring streamer and will never return. I'd rather have someone not know I'm streaming than to have them think (and maybe tell others) that I'm boring."
Twitch,3cc4x3,fullmeasures,2,Mon Jul 6 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"Well said, I will keep this in mind before starting my stream!"
Twitch,3cc4x3,gagsy92,2,Mon Jul 6 21:42:47 2015 UTC,"If it's any help, I've just started streaming myself and whenever I decide to stream something, I look at it like this:   If I'm by myself (not talking in party chat or anything), I'll want to stream a story game, something I can react to, like Batman, The Last of Us etc.  If I'm with my friends in a party chat, I'll play anything, even a game like Ark or ESO, that way, if I'm doing the boring farming stuff, I can start talking about something with my friend(s) to keep the viewers entertained.   If you do end up sticking with playing MMOs and farming, try and keep yourself talking. Even if it's just something along the lines of ""I'm farming these materials so I can build this, then when I've done that I can maybe work on building this, but could also build that because that can be a lot more helpful than this"". Just talking and giving your opinion on little things in the game will keep viewers interest.   If you offer your view, for example, 'this material seems useless', a viewer could come in and say 'hey man, that material is used to make those, they can be really helpful'. That's where your interaction comes in, then you can talk back and say 'Oh, well what other stuff do I need to make those and how's the best way to utilise them?'.   As Failstar said, you need to be crazy and talk to yourself constantly. Just say what you're thinking, even if it's a pointless statement like 'this items looks weird.'"

Don't lean just on any 1 of these things, mix and match as much as you can, but don't try and be a jack of all trades, do 1 thing really well, do 1 reasonably well and have 1 or both of the others available.

Easy example if I charged people 6 $ for a box with dried dog turds my head would get ripped off and sued and or not sell shit (lol pun kinda intended). However under the guise of cards against humanity, yah they sold a lot of shit (lol puns). You get where I'm going with this? Another example is pewdiepie (sighs) if we took your game play and threw his face and mic audio on top it'd get much more views (this is not an invite to act like him get that straight), reason being is his being vocal, narrating etc. To the same notion there are times where I don't talk for a solid minute but you try playing ddr/stepmania on some bulls hit step file that only an octopus can play at 300 beats per minute and some what odd 1200 steps condensed into 2 minutes or so.

If nothing happens in that 30 seconds, they leave.  So optimally you want to say something at least every 30 seconds, which is really hard. Even if it's just stuff like:  Think I am going to not buy anything this round.  I got X kills that round, I need to step it up.  A would probably be better than B. (Then you can follow it up with damn, everyones going to B)  Oh sweet, this is my favorite map because of X and Y.  I'm gonna camp here just for a minute or two just to see what's up.

Twitch,3cc4x3,BewmBoxxy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:58:21 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. Talking for hours on end without actually saying anything, is a skill. A skill to be practiced and honed. I streamed for 4 hours a day, every day, for at least 2 weeks before I had any actual viewers. I spent a lot of time talking to myself.  In off stream hours, jot down some random topics or stories from your past that maybe relate to what you're doing, maybe they don't, but keep them in view while you stream so you can glance over and spot a topic to talk about for awhile. My go to, as a story teller, is just making up super long winded, in depth stories about the characters or viewers. It became a 'thing' kind of, because I'd say ""Did you guys know..."" and when I said that, people in my chat would be like 'ohp, here we go, everyone shhhhh it's storytime!' and stuff like that."
Twitch,3cc4x3,Jesuswept669,0,Tue Jul 7 03:48:55 2015 UTC,"When I used to stream, even if no one was there I knew it was going to be on the net for while and others might watch it later. Just get in the habit of explaining everything you're doing, even if no one is watching. It sounds goofy, but if I'm watching someone play a game I want to understand why they're doing the things they're doing.  I used to play a lot of Dark Souls 2 and Binding of Isaac. Two very layered games with a lot going on and a lot of strategy. Even if I'm having a conversation with people I'd still stop to constantly update the chat on what I'm doing and why - ""Ok so I'm just re-running through this area coz I want to pick up this big sword which is really good for taking on boss xyz which we'll be encountering after I clear this next area"" or ""So I put a bomb here because typically secret rooms are most likely to spawn in the bottom of this kind of 'U' shape, oh look, sure enough there it is... now viewer xyz, what were you saying about lobster chowder?"".  I find I watch streams of people playing games I like but I don't know as well as they do so I enjoy learning their techniques and tactics from them. Try to give a constant stream of consciousness going so people feel more engaged in what you're doing and why."
Twitch,3cc4x3,Jesuswept669,8,Tue Jul 7 06:35:22 2015 UTC,"I think you have 2 big problems. One of them is the severe lack of talking and the other is that you are streaming a game a lot of people are streaming.   The talking is a hard one, but just try an talk about what you are doing and what you are going to do. Maybe even playing more with friends and having conversations with them if needed.  As with the game you play, ARK is for example is played and streamed by a ton of people and is one of the most popular games. Very few people will go so far down that they will see channels with only 2-5 viewers. It has the same effect as streaming league of legends while they have a championship going on, nobody is going to go to you but to the big numbers.   Then again, I don't stream and this is just my opinion. I hope it helps"

I jumped around in some older streams and you did have more talking but mostly to other players.  I think having no commentary is a big downfall. It's hard really to judge you because I can't get a feel for your personality since you didn't talk much. My suggestions moving forward is ditching the music and focus on commentary. Take this as a challenge, Try a few single player games and start commentating what you are doing and start discussions. If you're not finding success in how you are streaming, do a complete 180."

And for the talking one thing that has helped me is by reading a few articles or browsing a website I like and then talking about it. Best of luck though man aside from that the quality actually was good.

Twitch,3cc4x3,fullmeasures,3,Mon Jul 6 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"Some tips that might help you for generating more commentary.   You can talk about anything, not just what you're doing in the game, not just about the game itself.  Talk about your day.  Talk about other games you like to play.  Talk about gaming news.  Talk about your streaming.  Talk about anything, just talk about something. When you don't have viewers who are watching your whole stream, you can repeat yourself.  Have an interesting opinion on something.  Talk about it again.  If you have different viewers, it'll be new to them, and makes it less difficult for you to come up with original commentary for hours on end. If you don't currently have viewers, think about the people who might be watching your VoD when you're offline.  Talk to them.  Just because no one is watching you right now doesn't mean that no one will watch that segment at a later time."
Twitch,3cc4x3,PancakesWithBaconPWB,2,Mon Jul 6 20:36:07 2015 UTC,Very good points that I will take into account.

Twitch,3cc4x3,swan5753,2,Mon Jul 6 20:08:36 2015 UTC,"What worked for me is thinking out loud. Thinking is something you're already doing and it's great practice to when you do have an audience. When you're explaining your thoughts, this opens up to questions, understanding, and all sorts of things. You need to be able to be comfortable and willing to provide commentary of your thoughts. It doesn't stop when you have viewers, you will need to do this more! I highly recommend watching other streams or even Let's Plays on youtube. Those guys are usually talking to no one, but themselves.  I suggest watching your own streams and ask yourself is this fun to watch? This is a great way to make tweaks and changes to your approach. Also, be the viewer, make sure you spend the time being the viewer and knowing what you like in a stream.  The number of hours your streaming, you're going to burn yourself out. Broadcasting is a marathon.   Finally, I recommend networking. Go into another 0 viewer streams, and related on the game. Don't wait for the viewers, go to the viewers and make friends. Be genuine in your approach by relating in the game. If you both work well together, then you can go about supporting each other. This can go a long way.  As a person that started in April myself, I can't imagine the frustration you have with streaming, but I can relate to the struggle, 2 Follows in 3 weeks. It only takes one person to make that difference to get your 2nd and 3rd person. At the end of the day it's not about who follows you, but who comes back and how you manage that relationship."

Twitch,3cennd,ShadyShroomz,3,Tue Jul 7 09:15:47 2015 UTC,"Not nearly as good. Say I'm watching someone play Skyrim (A game I get lots of views on). Commonly when they stop streaming they will host someone else playing Skyrim. Not only that, but more people will be searching for someone playing Skyrim compared to a game no one plays.

Twitch,3cennd,catdragonnamedrose,2,Tue Jul 7 13:13:51 2015 UTC,You can stream what you want. But keep it in mind if your streaming a game with multiple pages of streamers then that means people need to work to get to your stream and therefore your stream won't be seen as often. However if you stream on a game where you're automatically on the first page you're more likely to get traffic to your channel.
Twitch,3celor,ComradeAlec,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:40:42 2015 UTC,"Knowing your budget would help. I know you don't want internal, but mostly all USB cards, especially USB 2.0, will have delay issues (mostly issues among the Elgatos) with streaming, so you will have to add a webcam or mic delay.

Twitch,3celor,ErrorByDefault,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:45:48 2015 UTC,Budget is roughly 250 dollars. How hard/nice would it be to add a delay?
Twitch,3celor,ErrorByDefault,0,Tue Jul 7 09:00:06 2015 UTC,"Its not hard adding the delay. The problem is the delay is inconsistent. Over time, it gradually gets out of sync again and again, so you have to keep adjusting. External cards just aren't worth it IMO unless you're recording for youtube or the like. Is there absolutely no space in your PC? No empty PCIe slots?"

Twitch,3celor,ErrorByDefault,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:27:20 2015 UTC,"What Dodgepong said is nonsense. The delay is consistent so you only have to delay each thing by the same amount and leave it at that - one and done. For the HD60 it's 700ms and for the HD it's around 1400ms (haven't actually spent the time to figure this one out accurately since I'm using the HD60 atm).    If you've got audio on your PC you can just use a global audio offset in OBS, then use a -700ms delay on the Elgato audio to match everything up."

Twitch,3celor,Kaahlan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:39:18 2015 UTC,"Like others have pointed out, external cards will give you a second or two delay which can be very annoying.  I have the Avermedia Live Gamer HD myself, which is an internal PCIe card, and I have no delay at all, and the card does a good job offloading work from my CPU and I dont think I will ever switch to an external card."
Twitch,3celor,dodgepong,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:55:37 2015 UTC,"If it's possible avoid external 2.0 capture cards - if you're at all serious with streaming, you will eventually find them inadequate for your needs. An internal will almost always be better for streaming (assuming it's not a crappy internal card, of course). If internal simply isn't an option consider a 3.0 USB capture card (sorry don't remember any names off the top of my head).  As for how a capture card works, it is basically detected as a camera ""source"" in your streaming software. Your console, gaming PC, etc goes into the capture card and then you can output the video feed into your streaming software. The advantage of this is it removes resources from your CPU (in the case of a 2 PC setup) or allows you to capture footage from things you otherwise wouldn't be able too like consoles.   You can also get creative with your capture card; for example, we had an extra capture card after upgrading to a better one, so we now use the old one to capture the video feed from a HD camcorder for our facecam. As good as the Logitech C920 is, it simply doesn't compare to a legit camcorder. Our facecam has excellent visual fidelity, we have a great deal more control over the image, and since a capture card is processing the video, that is less resources used by the CPU for encoding the actual stream, meaning having wiggle room to try better preset speeds, thus better overall quality of the stream!   Capture cards are awesome!"

Twitch,3celor,Kaahlan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"If you want an external card with essentially zero delay then I'd highly suggest looking in to the Avermedia ExtremeCap U3 (amazon link). Unlike the Elgato, you do not have to worry about adding a delay to your sound/cam. I picked the U3 up a few weeks ago and I couldn't be happier. It's USB 3.0 which eliminates the delay and its almost plug and play, just have to download the software from the Avermedia site. You can capture HDMI and component with this. I use the software to play on one of my monitors using the 'preview' and then use OBS to capture the preview. However, it is also possible to play on a TV if you get a splitter, while using the game capture as a source in OBS.   The only downside is that this card requires specific chip sets to work correctly as it is only compatible with a few. If you have an Intel Native, Renesas, or Fresco chip set then you should be set. Let me know if you have any other questions regarding this one!"

Personally I'd sooner get the XCAPTURE-1 over the ExtremeCap U3 due to the framerate/tearing issues I've seen with the U3. The XCAPTURE-1 is a superb device. If you don't need passthrough, the Startech USB3HDCAP is another good option."

Keep a window open for chat, and check it now and then. After that, don't look at viewer count.   If you want to play Fallout: NV, play it whether it's saturated or not! Viewers are not the end all be all, and it really should be about having a good time. People will naturally follow when they see you're enjoying yourself."
Twitch,3cdwdq,Zaalie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:06:10 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks. It's hard to not look at viewers though. Maybe I'll have another window and block it so I won't see it haha.

Twitch,3cdwdq,noremac13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:43:59 2015 UTC,"Now, just because other people aren't streaming it doesn't mean people don't want to see it! There are plenty of folks out there who search for certain games, and if you're the only stream in town that's playing said game, you've got a good chance of bringing that crowd in! In fact, it's one of the best ways for a new streamer to establish themselves; by not having to fight the crowds of the bigger games (like the Bethesda games you mentioned), you give yourself the ability to be unique, which is extremely important when trying to break that 10 concurrent viewer threshold.   Whatever game you're playing, keep at it, and you might just find fellow fans!"
Twitch,3cegah,Variantvision,3,Tue Jul 7 07:23:17 2015 UTC,"Since you're straying from using a headset mic, all you need now are headphones, not some crazy expensive headset like Astros (though I'd personally love a pair, because they rock). Honestly, since you aren't an audiophile, something super simple and a good bang for buck like the Sennheiser HD201 might be a good option. Very lightweight and comfortable with decent sound clarity. I know a lot of people will probably recommend something like Audio Technicas but you really don't sound like you need it for how pricey they can be.  But comfort will truly be on a case by case basis. I personally HAVE to try them on before I buy most because I have piercings in my ears and some don't fully fit over my ears and rub and cause discomfort. I'd go to best buy or the like and ask them to open up boxes or just try some pairs on. Then buy online for cheaper."
Twitch,3cegah,ErrorByDefault,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:33:53 2015 UTC,"Astro's would be ideal, but I care more about consistency and comfort at the moment, rather than name brand. I think these would be easy enough for me to find and try out. I personally like trying them on, but I feel like I have to spend a lot of time with them, because I have buyer's remorse sometimes :(   Honestly though, these seem pretty good especially since I will be using them for hours on end, and should they break, it wouldn't be expensive to replace :)  Thanks for your input!"
Twitch,3cegah,Joonaa,2,Tue Jul 7 18:27:02 2015 UTC,"I can personally recommend AKG K550's ($150 on Amazon). They are large enough for my ears, leather pads and have great sound (I invested in a new sound card...). The only thing you need is a bit of extra padding, I just put some string behind the pads and they are perfect.  Plus, they look good!  Edit: I'm currently wearing these around 14 hours a day, with no issues."

Twitch,3cegah,DoubleAlces,2,Tue Jul 7 18:24:11 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't recommend the Superlux HD 681 EVOs enough. They're not a very well known brand, but they're only $40, they sound pretty good (nice even sound signature for the most part), and are seriously the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. I regularly wear them for eight plus hours straight and my ears don't hurt at all. Plus they come with two lengths of removable cable, and two different types of interchangeable earpads.  If those don't suit your fancy you may also want to try over on /r/headphones, they have a big guide to the best headphones at different budgets."
Twitch,3cegah,BadNewsBenV,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:23:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice!   I really not opposed to trying anything that is not name brand, so I will look into these.

Twitch,3cegah,BadNewsBenV,2,Tue Jul 7 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"They feel sturdy, high quality plastic, etc. That said, I did break my first pair after about a year and a half of them never leaving my room, so perhaps they aren't as sturdy as they appear. I believe the flaw is in the small cable that connects to the detachable cord, as the audio one came out of one ear of my broken pair unless I pressed upon the short cable. The replacement model I purchased appears to have a much tighter fit between the short cable and the detachable one, so it may not be an issue anymore."
Twitch,3cegah,DiscreditGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"I like how they look honestly, so it's pretty good that they do have a really decent build. I hope they have updated quality control by now, and if so, it looks to be like a potential buy. Thanks again!"

These have a better price point too, so these are definitely in the lead.   How does the build quality feel? Anything weird you've noticed? Let me know!"
Twitch,3cegah,Dorbii,2,Tue Jul 7 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"The sound quality is great, especially for streaming. It's not like you're going to want a jaw dropping surround sound feel to it, as I'm sure you'll want to be able to communicate while playing the game.   With that in mind, the sound is crisp and I've gotten compliments on how good the microphone sounds. Build quality is sturdy and it comes in one of the most sleek packages you'll find for a headset. Only weird thing I've noticed is when splitting the headset/mic I'll sometimes get a low buzz. But I'm pretty sure I figured out what was going on, and it ended up being a non-issue. For the price, I really can't recommend it enough. Hell, wait for the Amazon sale and they may drop even further."
Twitch,3cegah,Dorbii,2,Tue Jul 7 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"I would say honestly that these are probably the one I'm most tempted to buy because I really love the overall look, and I've always heard they are comfortable. I watched an unboxing, and the packing is extremely sleek and stylish, much better than most packaging.   I completely forgot that Amazon was having a sale, so that may be the day I decide which one is the best for me. Thank again! :)"
Twitch,3cegah,kitiaralol,2,Wed Jul 8 02:30:28 2015 UTC,"I can highly recommend the Sennheiser PC 363D headset. I got mine last christmas and it is by far the best headset i have ever had.

Twitch,3ce7ji,Shado_Temple,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:53:53 2015 UTC,"Be mindful that being good at games doesn't necessarily mean you'll be great at streaming them. Short of being near-professional at your best game, most viewers look for those who can entertain while playing. Try to pick games that you'll be able to talk about/discuss with your audience, and that will be fun for yourself to play. If all of your energy is focused into playing the game, there won't be much left for you to commentate with."
Twitch,3ce7ji,Shado_Temple,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:58:44 2015 UTC,"Oh I totally agree! I just don't want to try to play some PC game that has a large following already and be well below average you know? That's why streaming Xbox games is intriguing to me. It would allow me to play games I can entertain people with both my interaction with my viewers and playing skill, all while not being games that are saturated with streamers like League or something. I just don't know if there are enough people out there interested in a new streamer of Xbox games is why I ask."
Twitch,3ce7ji,conradslater,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:02:56 2015 UTC,"That one's a bit tougher to answer, and is mostly dependent on the games you intend to stream. Anyone starting on Twitch these days is going to have a hard time getting going (getting your first 5-10 consistent concurrent viewers can take months), but choosing the ""wrong"" game can make it even tougher. The top 10-15 games on Twitch (like Halo, CoD, Destiny, etc. for the XB1) are overloaded with hundreds of streamers trying to make their start with what they perceive to be popular. While these games do get plenty of viewers, most of them are hanging out with the top 10 streamers of that game (since game lists are arranged from most viewers to least), leaving the remaining hordes of streams to fight over the remaining 10%. This leaves dozens of streams sitting at the bottom of game lists with 0-1 views, and getting little-to-no visibility. The usual solution is to find a game that isn't streamed nearly as often, which gives you a better chance of being noticed. Xbox or otherwise, every new streamer runs into this issue, and it can decide the fate of your channel's early days."

Twitch,3ce3g5,AustinScript,3,Tue Jul 7 05:00:11 2015 UTC,I recommend you stick to 2000Kbps as a non-partnered streamer or many of your viewers will experience buffering (and probably stop watching). To figure out the best resolution for whatever bitrate you choose try StreamCalc.net. Just enter the bitrate and game you're playing and hit calculate - it'll give you the best (approximate) resolution to use.

Twitch,3casqa,convicious,43,Mon Jul 6 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"Oh boy. Let me first say; This is a situation I think every person who's ever worked in the service industry (especially customer support) has experienced, and it's not a pretty one.  Let me pre-phrase this by saying that I have worked on Twitch Customer Support, although I am currently not. While I have some doubts about a fair few of the things you claim you experienced, I'm going to assume everything happened the way you say they did.  Here's the thing. The person you're talking to doesn't actually know whether or not the exchange you're talking about happened. They're not accusing you of lying when they say this, they're merely exercising caution. People contact support with false claims all the time, after all. So, in that situation, wouldn't you want the rep to let you know what the rules actually are?  Put yourself in the shoes of the person you're talking to. Imagine I tell you one of your moderators lied to me in a private message. Do you have any records of it happening? Most likely not. But I'm certain that your moderator sent me that message! So obviously that means you're in on it and lying too! Why did that moderator lie to me? Why do you continue to lie to me about it happening? I would still like an answer about why they lied to me!  ...  Do you see the problem here? Sometimes, even if a consumer is 100% certain about something, the rep they're talking to might not be. When that happens, the consumer has to be prepared to show why they believe what they do so certainly. If they do, the rep might be able to help! If they don't.. Well, what exactly are they meant to do?"
Twitch,3casqa,Kanthes,8,Mon Jul 6 21:12:07 2015 UTC,"I manage Support for a large company.  This is pretty much a solved problem at this point.  The reason you don't see issues like this come up very often from most large organizations is because they are trained to manage customer expectations and outcomes, not specific issues.  The CSR should have carefully explained the possible outcomes here and made sure that the customer understood them.  Since all conversations should be logged permanently (they ARE logged right?) there can be no dispute - if the customer was lied to obviously there is a larger problem here (and people should be getting fired, etc.) but given proper Support tools, the CSR should be able to understand the full context of the original statement and determine if it is time to ""re-evaluate that decision"", or stick to it."
Twitch,3casqa,FlamingTelepath,2,Tue Jul 7 00:17:13 2015 UTC,"Stuff is logged. No need to worry there!  I agree with pretty much everything you're stating there, but since we lack context in this thread, it's very hard to tell where things went wrong; If they did at all. Obviously, it's in Twitch's best interest to do a good enough job that things like this don't happen regularly!"
Twitch,3casqa,Kanthes,4,Mon Jul 6 15:45:23 2015 UTC,"Its fairly obvious at this point that we lack context because the post was intended to be nothing but inflammatory.  The OP has on multiple occasions made bizarre claims about the misdoings of twitch, random mysterious partners out to get her, and an underground community of twitch users that just hate her.  I wonder what she's done that made her so paranoid. EleGiggle In all seriousness though, this isn't the kind of post you'd make then just forget about so the fact that there is no response to replies is a pretty strong affirmation of suspicions that the OP is just a random lunatic.  Even the language used is suspect, example --Twitch lied, instead of I was told X by one person, then Y by another."
Twitch,3casqa,Belhifeto,3,Mon Jul 6 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it comes down something as simple as Twitch staff not being on the same page.   Most recently I experienced that with the whole issue of where I was allowed to stream. I got emails from one staff, claiming I was violating guidelines and policy, telling me I might get banned - Despite haven gotten explicit permission from other staff several times in the past, and with an overall behavior from Twitch as a whole that pointed towards it being alright (Like Twitch twitter promoting streams doing the thing I was apparently not allowed to). Even telling the staff about this didn't not persuade him to let it go and the email conversation ended with an ""I informed you of our policy, there's nothing more I can do""  Someone else got the same thing happening a few months later but this time from another staff.  I then end up emailing a third staff that confirms that I'm indeed allowed to do what I've been doing the entire time.  This happens often enough that it causes frequent issues for streamers. It has happened for a music streamer as well who was told that they weren't allowed to do their content, and then a little while later was told it was alright.  It's obvious that Twitch is not only bad at communicating with it's partners but also internally, and that needs to improve.  (Partners are never informed about big features and updates to the site prior to them coming out, resulting in broadcasts suddenly suffering from bugs and issues with the update for a couple of days after the release - Without any warning. It would be greatly appreciated if Twitch contacted partners a few days prior with a short email simply saying ""We're releasing something new, here's a list of things that may affect your broadcast"")"
Twitch,3casqa,HammerIsMyName,4,Mon Jul 6 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"While I personally understand the support person showing caution and proof of the original message should be given, I feel like it's a bit excessive to blatantly mention that the use of marijuana permanently affected OP's partnership chances, insist that no staff member would say medical use on stream is okay and put them on ignore, especially when it appears they initially messaged support for clarification rather than being busted doing it. What if it was simply a misunderstanding? If someone claimed a moderator of mine said something I wouldn't approve and I don't believe them, I would rather ask for proof before claiming it never happened."
Twitch,3casqa,laagone,5,Mon Jul 6 22:01:06 2015 UTC,"These things depends on context, which we're unfortunately lacking in this post.   If drug use's affect on Partnership was brought up or the rep had reason to believe it was relevant, it makes sense.  If OP was insisting that they had been told something in an email that isn't in the system, insisting that it hadn't been sent also makes sense.  And finally, putting them on ignore.. This one is controversial, for an understandable reason. Anyone working in support will be able to tell you that sometimes, as few times as possible, putting somebody on ignore is necessary.  Every situation can be handled in the best way possible, but sometimes they're not. Sometimes, there's simply nothing left for the rep to say. What happens then depends on the company, the guidelines, and the rep themselves."

If yes, then the best option would be simply not to do that on stream, or if it can't be avoided, don't use a webcam or turn it off when smoking. I watch a streamer who uses these new vapor dispensers and he turns the cam off when inhaling, not to encourage viewers to use drugs.

Even then, ""hard evidence"" such as screenshots of emails can be easily photoshopped and/or altered. So you're pretty much at a loss/loss situation.  I, personally, don't see any reason why you shouldn't smoke on stream, it's harmless. However if Twitch staff says no, then that means no, regardless of who said what and when. Policies can change at any time.  As per how the twitch staff reacted by blatantly calling you a lier, that's unacceptable. Twitch staff should know better than to react like that and it's completely unprofessional, regardless of who they're talking to."
Twitch,3casqa,Qromium,6,Mon Jul 6 17:06:38 2015 UTC,I find it weird that he's asking the Twitch Turbo staff and not partnerships. In all honesty it's not legal in all states so you can not smoke on stream.

I think more likely the guy who spoke to you initially didn't know what he was talking about, and just wanted to advise you to generally follow your local laws.    I wouldn't focus on ""I got lied to,"" and instead I would let them know you were previously given information that was apparently incorrect, which caused the current run of problems. Let them know you're happy to abide by their policies, and you apologize for running with the incorrect information you were given. Forwarding them the email you received (if you still have access to it) should go a long way towards helping to resolve the situation in a way both you and Twitch find acceptable. I believe that if you're persistent, respectful, and show you're willing to play by their rules, they'll eventually relent and work with you."

There have always been many people who get high occasionally and you wouldn't know it by interacting with them and it's just something they do.  But there are also many people who just can't STFU about the fact they're getting high...  Stoner culture is still a thing, even though medicinal / recreational cannabis use is being legitimized.  Seems like the concept OP failed to embrace was discretion.  Being coy about the edgy stuff you do doesn't make you lame or a liar.  It doesn't make you seem repressed or guilty.  It makes you clever.  In fact, discretion is a part of what cool is (in the traditional meaning of the slang term / subculture)."

Remember it doesn't matter whats right or wrong, it's what's on the books.

The response you got doesn't necessarily translate to ""Please go ahead and smoke weed on stream if it's legal in your state.""

And what about all of the people who drink heavily on stream because it makes them more lively? Drinking makes things better.   You sound as if streamers should be held to some kind of moral standard that, lets face it, most of their views probably couldn't be held to.

(This is my personal statement, I am bringing explanations below:)  You can put up a BRB screen without camera capture, disable Microphone and things like that, so you don't even come in trouble with the ToS. Like others going to the toilette or grabbing a beer, just letting the viewers know you're AFK now for some minutes.

Twitch,3cdzls,BulbStar,2,Tue Jul 7 04:17:39 2015 UTC,Just play the games you enjoy playing. One thing I have found is if you are trying to play a game because you think it will get you noticed and you don't enjoy it that will come through during a stream. So sure maybe you're one of the few streams playing said game and your chances of people coming into your channel are greatly increased but if people can tell you're not having fun it kinda defeats the whole purpose.   I am doing the exact opposite and streaming the super popular games so sure my channel may very well not get noticed by anybody but I at least know I'm having great fun playing the games and that's enough for me.
Twitch,3cdzls,Sportsfan723,2,Tue Jul 7 11:17:03 2015 UTC,"The general advice for new streamers is to avoid the top 10-15 games being played on Twitch.

Minecraft is actually not that oversaturated, at least in my opinion. I would avoid league of legends, hearthstone, CS:GO... basically the first 5 games and maybe a few after them. I also wouldnt stream anything with hardly any viewers because they dont have much of a fanbase and thus less people looking through that game for a new streamer to watch. Good luck :D"
Twitch,3cdzls,skyberry86,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:16:02 2015 UTC,"The only reason to avoid certain games is that with a low number of viewers you won't show up in the first few pages of the game's listing. As a result, very few people will stumble across your stream, making it much harder to grow as a channel.  Basically, look at your average viewer count and play any game where you'll be listed within reasonable scrolling distance of the top of the game's page."
Twitch,3cdzls,weefz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:41:34 2015 UTC,"IMO, I'd avoid Minecraft until you've been streaming for a bit, have a few dedicated viewers, a decent mod or two, and/or developed thick skin. Because based off of personal experience, it seems like trolls flock to Minecraft streamers."

It looked about as good as a 720p 60fps stream in that regard.   But you're right - it's not worth pushing out that resolution if you can't lower the preset speed. I probably couldn't do medium preset and game on the machine. I haven't even tried because I know on fast at that resolution and bitrate obs takes about 50% of my CPU.

Twitch,3ca1vb,J_ent,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"That may well be true in terms of the game's graphical merit, but it's excellent for demonstrating poor encoding and bitrate starvation, with lots of dark areas and high scene complexity."

Twitch,3ca1vb,Nyaliah,13,Mon Jul 6 23:25:26 2015 UTC,"I mean honestly, I really like twitch. But the transcoding is really a bitch. I am streaming with the suggested settings and even tried going further down with upload settings. And still I have someone everyday telling me the stream keeps buffering, especially in the last few days. I am sitting here watching a buffering stream as well, company internet, pretty good. Just wonder why.  Another point that really annoys me are the ads. There is an ad everytime you switch a channel, unless you block them or have turbo. AFAIK youtube got a system that you can skip ads and you aren't even getting one ad every new video. Channel hopping is a pain and I am sure a  lot of people don't really do it and stay with the channels they know."
Twitch,3ca1vb,Nyaliah,3,Mon Jul 6 09:39:52 2015 UTC,"totally agree, im from eu and i cant watch a single unpartnered stream over wifi because it keeps buffering even though i have 150/15 and full connection.  And the ads suck too. Its always the damn same ad for womens facecream, this is so damn annoying like why should i care about a brand made specifically for women."
Twitch,3ca1vb,nutella4eva,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"I keep getting beer ads. But Youtube is offering me the same ""it was time for us to chose a natural birth control. I just pee on this stick and know if we can have our monthly sex or not""."

Twitch,3ca1vb,nutella4eva,2,Mon Jul 6 11:21:23 2015 UTC,"How do you handle chat interaction? As a viewer I like to read what a streamer is replying to, eventhough he/she/xir read it aloud. And discussions about stuff would happen in 3 different channels. On one platform you have one active chat. As a streamer it is easy, just have 3 chat windows open, but for the viewers? Especially non-lurkers that get annoyed/confused as to whom on which medium you are speaking."
Twitch,3ca1vb,Nyaliah,3,Mon Jul 6 11:49:41 2015 UTC,"I have all chats open on stream as well as a banner letting everyone know that I'm streaming to three different places at once. It's very important to me that everyone's messages are shown and acknowledged on stream.  I usually don't bother with YouTube chat, since nobody ever watches me there. I just stream there so that all my streams are automatically archived forever (as well as for my viewers with poor internet connections)."
Twitch,3ca1vb,nutella4eva,3,Mon Jul 6 12:06:59 2015 UTC,Really? I already don't watch streams with webcam+chat overlay. And you have THREE chat overlays? Are they readable on mobile?  Is you game visible?
Twitch,3ca1vb,JaseIO,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:13:15 2015 UTC,"I currently don't use 3 chat overlays since nobody chats on my YouTube stream. I stream 4:3 games, which helps out a lot with the layout. It's very readable on mobile, I made that absolutely an important point, since a lot of my viewers say they are on mobile."
Twitch,3ca1vb,Nyaliah,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:35:37 2015 UTC,Could you implement a bot that spams the chatroom with quotes from the other chats?

Twitch,3ca1vb,luckyariane,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:25:37 2015 UTC,How would one effectively do this?  Do you have a seperate machine that pushes your stream to each one?
Twitch,3ca1vb,nutella4eva,4,Mon Jul 6 12:24:08 2015 UTC,Restream.io. You stream to it and it streams to every site you tell it to. No extra overhead for you.
Twitch,3ca1vb,GrindheadJim,3,Mon Jul 6 12:59:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, it absolutely baffles my brain that this is a free service. I have no idea if this will always be the case."

Twitch,3ca1vb,ExpAwesome,25,Mon Jul 6 08:13:18 2015 UTC,To be fair YouTube also kind of sucks
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheXseption,17,Mon Jul 6 08:16:25 2015 UTC,True but in different ways. It is high quality and lets almost anyone monetize.  Though I'm not sure what their equivalent to the partner system will be or HoW the will handle video game monetization.
Twitch,3ca1vb,Nyaliah,9,Mon Jul 6 08:24:15 2015 UTC,"I won't be switching, but my biggest concern would be the content id system they have which is supposedly going to be running in real time over streams which means live takedowns for music and cutscenes. Plus since the system is so bad it'll also detect stuff that you may have permission to use."
Twitch,3ca1vb,ScaryFast,6,Mon Jul 6 08:38:50 2015 UTC,I think there could be a switch in community mindset.  Why do viewer expect streamer to play music? Every user can simply use their own music.  I actually don't get why this isn't the normal. I don't want to torture my viewers with 50 shades of grey soundtrack if I am in the mood for that. But they q_q if I don't play music. I just don't understand this mindset.
Twitch,3ca1vb,skwert99,5,Mon Jul 6 10:00:50 2015 UTC,"I sometimes like music in streams, in some games, during downtime, etc. In fact I've discovered and purchased quite a bit of music from just one streamer. I know I'm not the norm, but I'm not the only one."
Twitch,3ca1vb,ScaryFast,3,Mon Jul 6 11:35:43 2015 UTC,The trouble with music is that all the major labels say they don't want you playing their stuff on streams.  That's their prerogative.
Twitch,3ca1vb,joan_hickson,8,Mon Jul 6 13:55:12 2015 UTC,"I know, but it's stupid. They want people to buy this stuff, but seem hell bent on preventing people from actually knowing it exists so they can buy it. The music industry is retarded."
Twitch,3ca1vb,floppyquill,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:03:11 2015 UTC,"plus, realistically, for most streams at least, you're talking over the music or at the very least there's gamesound. not ideal for pirates."

Twitch,3ca1vb,alekxandar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"I like to play music occasionally, and it's always royalty free stuff that I have permission to play; however, the content id system is terrible and it may still pick it up and flag it for monetization by someone else or could give me a copyright strike and the same goes for cutscenes in games."
Twitch,3ca1vb,MowwMoww,2,Mon Jul 6 15:01:31 2015 UTC,This is still unconfirmed!
Twitch,3ca1vb,kiskae,4,Mon Jul 6 08:50:18 2015 UTC,It's not unconfirmed at all. They've been doing it for a long time and I have personally had streams muted and taken down due to music copyright.
Twitch,3ca1vb,Qromium,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:35:05 2015 UTC,The issue would be that Youtube has shown that it has the capability to run ContentId on streams. This could be used as evidence if someone tries to sue them for not actively preventing copyright infringement.
Twitch,3ca1vb,ExpAwesome,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:55:33 2015 UTC,YouTube would then take down the stream later and strike the account for multiple contentID matches.
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheXseption,2,Mon Jul 6 10:31:40 2015 UTC,Did not know about that.  Sounds like an awful idea
Twitch,3ca1vb,Focuzed,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:52:26 2015 UTC,"It's the system that currently runs over all YT videos, and it's been known to be pretty terrible. I also wonder if they'll let companies like Nintendo claim any of the revenue from content matches like it currently does with gameplay videos."
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheXseption,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:36:00 2015 UTC,"and you heard this where? It hasn't been discussed publicly yet, but somehow you know how it will work?"
Twitch,3ca1vb,FakeTherapist,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:47:57 2015 UTC,"It was discussed on the drop frames podcast last week, and someone further up was talking about how they already do it for current live streams on YouTube."
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheXseption,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:54:17 2015 UTC,cutscenes too? really?
Twitch,3ca1vb,FakeTherapist,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"Yup, right now a lot of people are having their revenue claimed on Arkham Knight lets plays because WB has content id'd the cutscenes in the game, and that's just the most recent that I've heard. Lots of game companies do this because cutscenes and music are the only reliable way for a game company to setup content id on games to get people's ad revenue."
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheXseption,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:48:30 2015 UTC,Do you have any links to this stuff? This is my first time hearing this....if the music\cutscene is linked do they take all revenue? Or just a cut?  Also are you saying your stream just cuts off in arkham knight if you get to a cut scene?!?!?
Twitch,3ca1vb,FakeTherapist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:50:04 2015 UTC,"I don't have any links, but if you search Angry Joe Nintendo rant on YT, he has a video about Nintendo claiming the ad revenue from his videos. If your videos are content id'd then the company who matched the id will take all ad revenue. There are a lot of issues with the system since its automatic, and it can also be abused by anyone by simply manually claiming you own the rights to the video.  Keep in mind that's how it's currently run over non-live videos. I've never streamed on YT, but from what I've heard it's pretty similar. I don't know how it deals with cutscenes live, but apparently if it content id's something then you will have 30s to remove it or your stream will cut out."
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheXseption,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:58:39 2015 UTC,So....I don't even....can you stream arkham knight in twitch? Is there a list of 'forbidden' games/companies?
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheEveryDayStruggle,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:09:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're fine to stream anything on Twitch except Adult Only games and a few select other games like Hatred, Leisure Suit Larry, and Hunie Pop. I'm not sure why, but game companies haven't gone after content creators revenue on Twitch like they have on YouTube, it might have to do with how much larger YT is."
Twitch,3ca1vb,Towelliee,8,Tue Jul 7 15:31:24 2015 UTC,Youtube servers and google servers shit on twitch period.  It's just a blatant fact. It has a huge following as well not for just gamers but for everyday viewers.   but twitch is here and has a bunch of die hards who wont leave either. It is what it is though. It doesn't matter. If you don't make it on twitch maybe you'll make it on youtube streaming.
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheEveryDayStruggle,3,Tue Jul 7 15:36:16 2015 UTC,Doubt it there's millions of gaming content creators in YouTube for gaming versus 11k partners on twitch statistically twitch would be ideal for growth
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheXseption,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:01:52 2015 UTC,Towelliee - I understand what you mean. Both will have the ups and downs to it and I still feel youtube gaming itself will be viable. Maybe not as much growth but you can do a mixture of both. I still feel no matter what both will grow exponentially and bring more to the community then their already is. I personally enjoy the community on twitch and youtube comments can be pretty damn harsh but you never get a troll free experience ever.
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheEveryDayStruggle,0,Mon Jul 6 08:30:09 2015 UTC,"They sure do in that regard, but the content id system that will be running in real time on all streams is sure to be shit too, and if you have any issues with it, good luck getting any help from a robot. They both have some major downsides in comparison, and it just depends on which ones you'd rather be subjected to."
Twitch,3ca1vb,CASIZBEAST,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:19:01 2015 UTC,I look at both sides and understand and hope to make it on either one when the time comes and support both no matter what honestly.   Their are upsides to each and downsides to each and we will see those as the time comes.   All this worry about the nonstop cut out music etc youtube isn't stupid. They will figure it out for a money standpoint and community. I believe in twitch fixing their servers as well. The amount of money people bring into twitch so far is ridiculous.
Twitch,3ca1vb,caseharts,5,Mon Jul 6 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I would love to stream at 1080p 6000kbs ;)"
Twitch,3ca1vb,Marstead,3,Mon Jul 6 08:35:24 2015 UTC,yup and I will. Its a huge deal.
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheXseption,3,Mon Jul 6 11:12:57 2015 UTC,"If you are unpartnered, I highly recommend streaming to both services simultaneously using restream.io and cover both bases. There is nothing but upside to using this service.  It can draw additional viewers to your Twitch platform and improve your eventual chances at Twitch partnership--and if you're offered a Twitch partnership and asked to stop streaming with YouTube, it doesn't matter anymore.  I have a banner in my stream that directs buffering Twitch users to try watching on YouTube. I keep the Twitch chat displayed in my video stream with another note suggesting YouTube users can participate in chat by heading to Twitch. I have several users with bad internet who watch on YouTube and chat on Twitch. It works great.  You can avoid putting all your eggs in one basket."

Twitch,3ca1vb,linkwall,4,Mon Jul 6 11:21:48 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they already confirmed it along with a max bitrate of 9000.
Twitch,3ca1vb,TheXseption,3,Mon Jul 6 15:09:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, YouTube have confirmed everyone gets transcoding and the max bit rate is 1080p60 at 9000Kbps or 9Mbps"
Twitch,3ca1vb,Flaimbot,3,Mon Jul 6 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"We are at this crossroad, and struggling with this question very seriously.  Wife/Husband duo casters.  9 month experience.  Been pulling atleast 100 active viewers past month.  Do we apply for partnership, giving complete loyalty to twitch?  Or go to youtube that is probably going to have a huge transition of viewership at launch?  I figured twitch was the safe bet, but the burn of previous generic denial letters left a bad taste in my mouth.  The excuse of transcoding being so expensive, then handing it out when youtube offers it.  If anyone from Twitch reads this, we want to believe in you, but we could sure use some reassurance."
Twitch,3ca1vb,K7Avenger,2,Mon Jul 6 07:39:24 2015 UTC,"The generic denial emails are in place because so many people apply. If you message them back they will likely get back to you on what you need to improve on, and you'd never hear from staff at YouTube or be able to contact them. As far as transcodes for more people, Twitch is trying to compete with YouTube which will be giving transcodes to everyone, and Twitch isn't nearly as big or have as many resources to do that so they settled for the next best thing."
Twitch,3ca1vb,DeadlyHooves,3,Mon Jul 6 13:47:09 2015 UTC,100% yes. on top of that they most likely are not going to throttle the speed of sub-10-viewer streams. these 2 things are what is holding a lot of people back on twitch who want to deliver a high (visual) quality stream.
Twitch,3ca1vb,CieroXy,2,Mon Jul 6 11:23:30 2015 UTC,"Some would, some would not.  I watch mostly smaller, modest channels that do not stream with a high bitrate or resolution who wouldn't leave their 'home' on twitch for that.  If everyone doesn't switch, those channels won't and neither will the audience for those channels.  They have no reason to because they technology doesn't matter to them."
Twitch,3ca1vb,Spyger,2,Mon Jul 6 15:17:27 2015 UTC,I used to stream but because of moving I can't anymore because my internet is too slow.  If youtube offers transcoding for everyone I'd actually never use twitch again. I cant watch non transcoded streams on this connection.
Twitch,3ca1vb,eax_angwer,2,Mon Jul 6 12:13:23 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely highly interested, simply because of the over saturation of Twitch."

Twitch,3ca1vb,trumpi,2,Mon Jul 6 13:56:47 2015 UTC,"I am not partnered yet, and I am not even considering to leave Twitch for any other streaming services. The community is just great and I met many amazing people here, being some Mod in some good viewed channels, got my viewers/followers here, the report function if you get abused/trolled or anything annoying is just working fine (Thanks a lot for helping!) and the supports/staff members are kind.   And I do not have any quality/upload problems with my settings. I am doing Dota 2 on 1080p sometimes and it's working fine. (Maybe because there is not that much movement like in games like CS:GO as you guys said, but it's working and viewers like the quality.)   That doesn't mean youtube gaming is worse or not worth a shot, I am just enjoying Twitch already and gonna stay."
Twitch,3ca1vb,MrAchilles,7,Mon Jul 6 14:21:36 2015 UTC,"Twitch allowed a partnered streamer to sell nudes to her subs for months and refused to penalize her for it. They also took down every thread talking about her selling the nudes and tried their best to cover it up.  It's no secret that the rules are completely different for large streamers - they're allowed to do whatever they'd like, including harassing other streamers and streaming blatantly non-gaming-related content.   It really isn't surprising at all that many people will be making the switch."

Twitch,3ca1vb,Cyarell,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:29:56 2015 UTC,"As an unpartnered streamer, I believe I will stick with Twitch. Youtube Gaming will have its pros and cons as well. The main advantages of Youtube Gaming will be the better servers and  monetization. However, I expect a large migration of small streamers to swap over to YT when that launches.  The reason I am thinking of sticking with Twitch has a bit to do with the migration. If so many people jump platforms, there is more room here on Twitch for myself to grow. Another amazing thing about Twitch is the community itself. The people you get to meet and interact with just can not be met on Youtube's platform. Maybe that will change when YTG launches, but I feel like it will be very competitive.  Twitch should and will feel pressure from YTG to step up. With Amazon backing Twitch, I do believe a lot of the weaker aspects of site will be worked out in time. Twtich has been a big part of my life for years and I am not gonna abandon it just because there is some rich new kid on the block."

The new system will have the content id running live and taking streams down live when copyright infringement is detected. Though this is happening on the streamers side and not the viewers so I can't imagine how they will handle GEMA. But the YouTube gaming guy that is running around Reddit said that yt gaming will not be blocked and the press release about only UK and US was about the apps and not the service itself.

Twitch,3cdinv,Itaku,2,Tue Jul 7 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"Spamming isn't inherently bad though, it's good to remember. Some Trihex raids are excellent examples of humorous or positive spamming."

He had 5 viewers, a higher up streamer raided him with 50 viewers. He then gained a ton of followers and in turn we followed the guy who raided him. It is beneficial for both sides because it gains them notice :P"
Twitch,3cdinv,Dorbii,2,Tue Jul 7 01:52:18 2015 UTC,"Streamers might raid someone when they're ending their stream, to help them out and possibly introduce some of the viewers to someone new, as a sort of a ""hey my stream is done but let's go over to this channel"" gesture. Generally speaking it's okay to do when you're doing it in good faith and you know the recipient is okay with it, all streamers I know gladly receive all raids."
Twitch,3cdinv,laagone,2,Tue Jul 7 01:57:20 2015 UTC,"A minor thing based on personal experience - if you're raiding someone you don't really know, make sure you tell your viewers to say ""(Your name) raid!"" or something like that. I had someone raid me and they used some kind of inside joke from their stream, I had no idea it was a raid, and my mods thought we were getting hit by spambots."
Twitch,3cdinv,AnneMunition,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:04:06 2015 UTC,"The general sentiment seems to have been stated, but I'll drop my hat into the ring as well.  Raiding other streamers can be a great way to give underexposed streamers more followers and viewers. However, there is malicious raiding which is not okay in any circumstance. Even for raids where people are trying to help someone out, it's usually a good idea to get permission from the person you're going to raid first."
Twitch,3cdinv,Caffeinewriter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:34:06 2015 UTC,"Raiding is fine, but you have to know your viewerbase. If you have normal viewers, go ahead and raid and show your love. But if you have like a toxic stream (say, Brittnay Venti) you should really ask permission from the streamer before you raid them as you'd be sending your toxic viewers to their channel and they may not want those kind of viewers."
Twitch,3cdi3e,RecklessDonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:45:39 2015 UTC,"Do you mean hearing th console on your desktop? The answer to that is no, unless you have OBS open and use preview mode, because you're effectivly listening to OBS.  As for the delay, that's because you have an Elgato dude. All USB cards have the delay, unfortuantly there's nothing that you can do about that. On the stream end, I'd stick a delay on your cam/mic."
Twitch,3cdi3e,floppyquill,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:52:23 2015 UTC,Yeah I figured that was the case. Actually the delay in voice/commentary on the stream side is pretty well resolved with the newest version of Elgato software. Thanks for the reply to help confirm.

Twitch,3cclza,Imagine42,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:45:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's go as far as to say that they used music without permission. They still muted game content that had no music; content that I would have liked to have kept. I realize it's my fault for not recording locally, but they still made an error that they should address. The fact that I've gotten zero response is what I'm irritated about. This has nothing to do with the game creators themselves."

Twitch,3cbyut,P3xus,3,Mon Jul 6 18:51:58 2015 UTC,"What you just said is definitely a good way to do it. Talking to them as if they were your friends is what a lot of streamers do and it creates a ""bond"" between the viewer and the streamer. Friends are more likely to come back than viewers.

Twitch,3cbyut,DamnNoHtml,4,Mon Jul 6 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"if you stream for longer every time (at least 3+ hours is a good place to start imo) you're making yourself more available, and opening yourself up to more possible viewers, or walk-ins. consistency is always helpful in the long run. eventually as your regulars get to know each other it'll improve, and as with building anything else, it just takes time. if you focus too much on numbers, you won't be enjoying yourself, and you'd be surprised how quickly people can pick up on that. try hiding your viewer count for a day and only look at chat?  good luck!"

Sadly, you will not appeal to everyone and they may leave. When you say talk to them, do you call them out of the user list? If so, stop. This could be a lead cause to them leaving. Have you tried looking at the r/Twitch Wiki? It has lots of useful advice on this type of thing."

Twitch,3cd1mi,skillaz1,3,Mon Jul 6 23:31:06 2015 UTC,"Seen a few people have this issue recently and as far as I know there's no way around it - you could try contacting PayPal support and asking them why you're all of a sudden required to connect a credit / debit card to your account (it may possibly be due to a total payments threshold with ""unverified"" accounts - not 100% sure).  If that doesn't work quite a lot of channels these days have the alternate payment methods enabled for their subscription button which may help you find an alternate way of paying for your subscriptions (the options are extremely flexible from Skrill to Subway gift cards etc)."
Twitch,3cd1mi,iTruthful,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"To the best of my knowledge it is a PayPal issue not a Twitch. If you want to sign up for any sort of subscriptions service using PayPal there has to be a credit card/bank account linked to your account. Also when you choose to use your PayPal account to pay for a Twitch subscription (channel or turbo), PayPal handles all payment options. There used to be away to bypass this issue but I am not sure this still works, all you have to do it add a funding source (credit card) to your PayPal sign-up for subscription then remove funding source (credit card). There was plans a while back to add additional payment options for subscriptions(channel or turbo) so that people with issues like yourself could pay in other way. Hope this helps.  edit: other payment method have been added in the way of pre-paid card."

Twitch,3cc47c,superfly33,2,Mon Jul 6 19:28:16 2015 UTC,"superfly33 I have done some research into the microphone you currently have, my only worry is that it seems to be USB powered and mixer/jacks will not allow the microphone to be powered. Even though on the amazon page you linked it states    Unlike other USB mics that require a powered USB hub, Meteor Mic plugs right into your iPad with Apple's USB connector. It's never been easier to start recording.    I would still imagine that the microphone would still require some sort of power input as there is no other power inputs visible. A possible solution to this problem would be purchasing (if not already owned) a USB splitter then using one of the USB to power the microphone and the other convert the USB > 3.5m > 6.35mm. I'm not 100% sure about how the microphone quality but would imagine in some way the audio quality may be affected by all the adapters that would be used."
Twitch,3cc47c,SamClose1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:07:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to answer me. That is a good point, I'm not sure if the mic would require and additional power source, what I'm thinking is I might test to see if the mic would work with the USB>3.5mm first, the cable is cheap so I don't mind trying that part out first.  Then I will build off of that. thanks again for the info"
Twitch,3cc47c,SamClose1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:13:49 2015 UTC,No problem at all. I have no personal experience with the Samson Meteor Mic USB Studio Microphone so can only get my information from the given product detail and reviews. You are probably doing doing the best thing by testing the USB > 3.5mm first before shelling out a load of money on something that might not 100% work. Hope it all goes good for you.
Twitch,3cc47c,Rocket_Burn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:20:13 2015 UTC,A few questions why do you want a mic that has 1/4 in connector??  What exactly do you want the mic to pick up?  I'm using a USB interface Card and an over head condenser mic the round pencil looking one for my setup mostly because i had the stuff already and they use XLR connectors the mic in question  requires phantom power form the interface/board its connected to. This particular mic is Omnidirectional it will pick up the air conditioner about 25 ft away and my whispers if i have it placed right in front of me. If you want a mic that only picks up whats put right in front of it you will want a Cardioid Microphone. Dynamic mics for the most part dont requiier phantom power but arent as strong as Condenser mics.
Twitch,3cc47c,Rocket_Burn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:37:58 2015 UTC,"I want to split the audio so I can hear it on my game PC, and my stream PC, so I can play music from my stream PC so I can't hear it while playing. right now all audio has to go through my stream PC bc I use HDMI. idk if that cleared anything up for you, I will make a video about how my setup works when I get home from work if need be. maybe I can bypass this mess all together."
Twitch,3cc47c,Rocket_Burn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:22:04 2015 UTC,"So lets establish the signal path of your current setup. Gaming PC (GPC) HDMI Video and Audio to your Stream PC(SPC) which I imagine has the Microphone attached correct?   And the problem is not wanting to use a different mic but you want to have music playing on the stream but not hear it while you are playing  .   I'm going to assume you wanted to use the mixer so that you can have your mic in one channel and music in another and send the main output of the mic to your SPC ? That would certainly work but not with your current mic as it has neither 1/4' or XLR output .  Let me ask you this do you use OBS and if so what sound desktop audio device is selected in the audio options. If it is your soundcard not your HDMI input you might be able to use your sound cards mic line in and just connect an ipod or similar device via 3.5mm ""aux"" cord and output to your main output in the soundcard using the ""listen to this audio device"" checkbox in the soundcard driver settings. Which would work with your existing hardware assuming you have an ""aux"" cable .  *edit sorry about calling it a 1/4' connector and not 6.35mm as you seem accustom to . Coming from from the world of live sound that particular cable can/is called many things as it has multiple uses."

Twitch,3ccok3,DamnNoHtml,3,Mon Jul 6 22:05:14 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of things to consider:   If you're goal is to showcase high-level gameplay, then make sure your title refers to this.  Examples include if you've achieved a certain rank in a FPS, or if you're speedrunning a popular title.   If you're goal is to showcase entertainment, then your title should be more creative.  Using Fallout 3 as an example:  ""Supermutant Extermination League - Members Wanted!""...""Radioactive Adventures in DC""...""Nuka Cola is the Best Cola - Come take a sip!""...""Capital Wasteland Exploration - Mind the Deathclaws"".  Basically, you want something that will catch a person's eye. Generally speaking, I'd avoid titles that are negative or very vague without any creative description.  Things like ""No viewer stream, whatever""...""Doing whatever""...""Playing Fallout"".  To me, those aren't interesting, and won't make me click a stream.   PWB"

If you get DDOSED or receive any threats about someone (It's enough somebody types it in your chat e.g.) you should report this to the Twitch staff handling such issues.  I had this on my channel many times, I always reported and the problem was solved by Twitch taking actions against those harassing people:  Here is a link i received from support how to report proper:   http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/725568-how-to-file-a-report  Anyways don't let anybody disturb you or get you down. You have your idea playing video games on this awesome Website, so spread it out bro .^  You need good Mods in your channel, who back you up with banning ToS vioalting messages and report those accounts as well.  Don't be afraid, this community is great and gets your back if you're harassed.  Don't ignore the tipps from other users as well, Skype is only mentioned to used by you with friends. Also be aware which teamspeak servers you use. (I have my own, so DDOS on TS is impossible since only me and my Admins see IPs). As user mentioned already, try to make it as difficult for DDOSer as it can be, but don't be afraid to report it, if somebody get's neat to you, Twitch will help you.  So a nice night and best greetings =)"

They recently increased the amount of transcoding options, extending it to many more streamers.   Those are quite welcome improvements, although I can't say I'm not a bit disappointed that we haven't seen a bigger improvement, considering that Twitch now has direct access to the entirety of AWS."

Twitch,3ca9ev,floppyquill,14,Tue Jul 7 04:55:52 2015 UTC,Amazon has a hands-off approach to the companies they buy. IMDB and Good reads didn't change much either when they got bought - And that's a good thing.  Twitch is allowed to continue exactly the same way without someone going in forcing changes in order to generate more revenue
Twitch,3ca9ev,HammerIsMyName,10,Mon Jul 6 11:04:40 2015 UTC,"increased capacity for transcodes happened like, less than a week ago. i am not sure if that is directly related to being acquired by amazon but i would imagine it has at least some influence.   changes take time. lots of time, you'll see more stuff come out gradually."

Twitch,3ca9ev,DehiXeM,9,Mon Jul 6 09:51:53 2015 UTC,"It takes time to integrate things like this. It's not like we got acquired and dropped everything to integrate, either; there was stuff in the pipeline that needed doing, our viewership was (and still is) growing rapidly, so we need more capacity, and as others have said, Amazon is letting us do things our way.  I came on after the acquisition, so I can't really comment on pre. My understanding from the folks who have been here a while is that the only change is the rate we bring on new people and new capacity. Both have grown many fold, which others have noted as ""getting servers in Country X"". We also have lots of plans to do a lot of the things everyone here constantly bitches about like we had the engineering capacity to do everything, except now we have loads more and can spend the time on that stuff. (Which stuff I can't say, since that'd be divulging sensitive information; I can tell you that a lot of stuff is slated to complete by EOY, and a lot of you have asked for a lot of those projects).  Basically, some of the things the loudest complainers here have wanted are gonna get done, you'll buffer less because we have more servers in more places, and some other stuff that I think is totally sweet (and will likely work on) that I can't wait until we announce.  I'm sorry I didn't give a lot of detail about the specific things we are working on. I'm an engineer, not a social media guy, and don't really know which details are public and which aren't.

Twitch,3ca9ev,krihan,6,Mon Jul 6 17:50:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know how you ""checked it""; buffering is a result of insufficient bandwidth from our edge nodes to you, and there's a whole shitload in the middle that can go wrong, most of which you have no visibility into unless you literally call on the phone some of the good people who run the network between us and you. Things like speed test can be misleading, since some ISPs actually special case that traffic to make their service look better (and yes, this is a known problem). Or, you could be in one country, and the streamer in another halfway around the world, and we know that's a problem that we will be gradually fixing over time by throwing lots of money at the problem.  We, however, do have that visibility I mentioned. Send me a pm with your country (NOT city or anything else particularly identifying), ISP, and the name of a few of the streamers you're having trouble with. No promises that I can figure out what's up, but maybe there's something obvious to us."

So I suppose in a way it can be viewed as more random that most pseudo random number generators since it can utilise the bit-conversions of language from random people, however since it will also use a pseudo random number generator in lieu of human input, to this degree it is a limited system.

You're right, the songs in that VOD are in the twitch music whitelist ,and appear to be false positives. The music licensing database, along the whitelist, is external. Music labels are the ones who control what goes in them, and it got off sync.   The music database provider has been contacted, and there's ongoing work to do a longer term fix, which will make things smoother."

There was recently an increase in transcoders availability (Top ~1200 channels) which explains why you (or anyone) will see more and more channels get them but in no way does that mean those channels are closer (or further) from partnership.   Remember that you can always reply to the denial email asking why you were denied, what you can improve on, etc. And that just because you ""way over the requirement for partnership"" does not mean that you will get partnership since those are more of a general guideline."

Twitch,3cbpyr,Qromium,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really just depends on your rig and how much it can handle. I have a moderately powerful rig, but I definitely feel it if I tried to record fancier games. I remember experiencing some lag when I accidentally turned on recording while playing GTA V. Otherwise it's not too much of a hog on CPU. But results always vary."

The El Gato HD60 is problematic for an i5 as you have to screen capture the feed. If your Mac has thunderbolt or USB 3.0 go for a device that uses that hardware. USB 2.0 devices like the HD60 are made to only work with their proprietary software. Like the Avermedia LGP and the ExtremeCap U3, which is a USB 3 device, will not work with OBS MP on Mac. Get yourself a black magic intensity shuttle and you wont have this issue."

Twitch,3cbi3h,UltimaN3rd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:05:25 2015 UTC,Have you tried unplugging all unnecessary USB devices? Tried different USB ports? Tried recording with the Elgato software to see if it stutters there?
Twitch,3cbi3h,MRBifuteki,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:58:54 2015 UTC,Yup tried usb 3.0 and 2.0. When I stream through elgato's software it works fantastic but the quality is so bad and i can't add twitch alerts and what not so I really need to use obs. Xsplit I need to pay for 60fps so I don't want to use that either.
Twitch,3cbi3h,MRBifuteki,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:05:13 2015 UTC,These devices were not made for streaming outside of their software. I am pretty sure if you tried streaming with el gato's software suite it would not give any issues.
Twitch,3cbi3h,eax_angwer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:41:55 2015 UTC,Yeah it does and i totally get it but other streamers seem to have it set up perfect and it was like that for me too up until not it started to act up :/
Twitch,3cbi3h,eax_angwer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:13:19 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that all these guys have it perfect everything. The device is a UsB2.0 device, it will lag no matter what at some point durning your cast. It is not made to do this kind of thing. As I stated before on a Mac things are different. You need to buy a device that works with streaming software. Right now OBS MP on the Mac works best with the Black Magic Design capture cards. Just get one of those if your Mac has Thunderbolt or USB 3.0. You will have less of a hassle using on of those devices."

Very few webcams out right now record 60fps at decent resolutions. You've got one of the best and well known webcams for streamers, so upgrading wouldn't do much.   What resolution do you have it set as? It does up to 1080p but honestly is unnecessary for most streamers. Try lowering to 720 or less under settings. You'll get more consistent frame rates doing that alone.  Also, are you using a capture card or anything of the like?"

Twitch,3caean,krihan,2,Mon Jul 6 16:48:35 2015 UTC,ditto. buffers everywhere. probably to do with more transcoding options being handed out? but who knows. they're always working to improve things so i'm not concerned with it lasting much longer.
Twitch,3caean,joan_hickson,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:47:59 2015 UTC,"I feel the urge to rant about how Twitch is 99% streamer focused and 1% viewer experience focused, but Twitch clearly isn't going to change that focus anytime soon, so meh. As a viewer I realised you have to take the initiative to make viewing Twitch a better experience and the good news is that there are some great tools out there to help you do that. You can even bypass the Twitch website interface completely now, as well as reduce buffering (especially in Vods) to an absolute minimum.  Google Livestreamer and grab that as well as VLC player, which will signifcantly reduce if not remove buffering (you may need to increase the cache in settings). Then get yourself chatty IRC to view the chat.  Whilst not needed, to really enhance the above set-up, google/grab the TwitchliveFollowers plugin for Rainmeter and the Rainmeter program itself of course, which is a very nice way to monitor and launch your live channels on your desktop.   I got all of this because I found it next to impossible to watch Lirik's Vods (and others) without buffering every 10-20 seconds, despite the fact that I have 150mb fibre. Whilst I was watching the spinning buffer circle of doom I'd test my connection with YouTube etc and I could watch in HD no issues, it was just Twitch. So over time I discovered the above tools and it's now possible to enjoy Twitch streams and Vods as they were intended.  Yes, it will take you a bit of effort to set it all up, but once its done it's done, and  the end result is worth it. Good luck."
Twitch,3caean,rcon__,5,Mon Jul 6 12:52:57 2015 UTC,"Twitch is 99% streamer focused and 1% viewer experience focused   This is a wildly inaccurate estimation. If you think for a moment that Twitch doesn't recognize that the viewers are it's source of income and cater to making them stay, you're mistaken.  There is no doubt that the past broadcast system needs work. It needs it from both sides of the experience, but when push comes to shove, this is a live video platform and will prioritize it's QoS projects for the live platform over the past video."

Don't ruin it by jumping on too early."
Twitch,3c9v1p,ThatOneGifGuy,6,Mon Jul 6 06:00:35 2015 UTC,"There are more benefits as a partner than just transcoding.   The number of non-partnered streams getting transcodes is variable. Not all the time a fixed number of top live streams will get transcodes. The way it works is that partners get transcodes every time, then the remaining capacity is spread across top streams. This number varies depending on how many partners are online."
Twitch,3c9v1p,filmsushi,3,Mon Jul 6 08:12:51 2015 UTC,"Probably helps, but doubt that it means too much. Transcoding and partnerships are two completely different animals."

For one, they can see your viewership numbers so they would know or be able to guess how often you are in the top 1200. Second, it has to be worth it for them to partner you monetarily, if you don't have enough viewers that they may not be able to cover the transcoding cost, tax cost, and management overall of your partnership then it's just not worth it to them."

Twitch,3cat4b,ErrorByDefault,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:37:55 2015 UTC,"I am going to give a similar reply to ErrorByDefault. Low-motions games (such as Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm) where large amounts of the screen remain static require considerably lower bitrates compared to high-motion games (CS:GO, etc). So streaming low-motion games at 720p @ 30fps will require bitrate of around 1700,  so decreasing your bitrate from 2500 to 2000 shouldn't cause any visible difference to your viewers who have no problems currently."
Twitch,3cat4b,SamClose1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:54:40 2015 UTC,Hearthstone can be streamed at 1080p 60fps with 2000Kbps and look fantastic. You should definitely lower your bitrate to allow for more viewers to watch. Streaming at 1080p 60fps may not be advisable as Twitch streams are hilariously inefficient and use a lot of CPU power - some viewers may have trouble watching at those settings.
Twitch,3cat4b,UltimaN3rd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:08:23 2015 UTC,His main issue with streaming at 1080p/60 would be the load placed on his viewers' PCs. Decoding 1080p/60 can easily bring some of the lower/mid-range Intel CPUs to their knees.
Twitch,3cat4b,EDGAR_SEC,0,Mon Jul 6 18:31:44 2015 UTC,I said that in my response already...     Streaming at 1080p 60fps may not be advisable as Twitch streams are hilariously inefficient and use a lot of CPU power - some viewers may have trouble watching at those settings.
Twitch,3cat4b,UltimaN3rd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:33:22 2015 UTC,Your post was slightly ambiguous on whether you meant viewer decoding or streamer encoding.

I watched some streams or past broadcasts that took up to 9 hours. I'm in Europe and mid-day I can typically watch on Source. My Internet speed is well beyond the bitrates of the streams. In the afternoon I get increasing buffering. My guess is that this is when the US awakes. Streams become unwatchable because of constant buffering and I have to drop down to High. And often this also starts to buffer later in the evening, so I have to drop to Medium sometimes. It's really bad lately and it sure wasn't like this in the past."
