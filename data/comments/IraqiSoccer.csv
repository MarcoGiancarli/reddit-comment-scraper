He'll be the face of Iraqi football so he really needs to play as well as he is capable of. I'm also excited for this current generation of players. They are fully capable of surpassing the 2007 team, all that's needed is a proper coach with the ability to work by himself. I can't remember the last time we've had so many Iraqis playing in European leagues.   As for the aliraqi forums, I have no idea what happened.

As for the line up Real Madrid used, the starting line up was Casillas, Marcelo, Heinze, Pepe, Ramos, Gago, Baptista, Guti, Saviola, Raul and Robinho. They made lots of subs as well, so guys like Sneijder, Van Nistelrooy, Robben (real madrid's only scorer), Higuain, Cannavaro etc.. all made appearances."

IraqiSoccer,2r9kdi,kratos61,1 point,Sun Jan 4 03:07:19 2015 UTC,So how did we play?
IraqiSoccer,2r9kdi,NoFapMonster,2,Mon Jan 5 08:39:14 2015 UTC,"Not too bad. Created alot of chances in the first half though none of them were particularly threatening. Iran was mostly happy to let us hold onto the ball while they park the bus. That's their style under Queiroz.   Second half was more of the same, though we created less, but we did win a penatly, which Younis missed. Ahmed Yasin came on and almost immediately he set younis up with an easy chance, but Younis hit the post.   Watching the match you get the sense that there was a plan and a clear tactic. Something I haven't seen in the national team for a very long time. Another major positive was the lack of long balls from the defense to the attack. Radhi said he wants the team playing with short passes on the ground with no more long balls, and he's stayed true to his word.   Bad parts of the game was how ineffective Humam, Saad Abdul Amir, Amjed Kalef, Alaa abdul zahra and Ali Adnan were. Ali Bahjat was the worst player on the pitch and was responsible for the goal we conceded.   Ahmed Yasin was incredible. As soon as he came on, he was creating chance after chance, but there wasn't much help. Justin as well, did very well, but some of the other players are too slow and wasted alot of the great passes and through balls they recieved from Justin and Ahmed. Yaser Kasim did very well, but he was left by himself in midfield with little help.   Walid Salim proved that it was a good decision to drop Mehdi Karim. He did well, and so did Dhurgham at LB. I thought Dhurgham played much better than Ali Adnan has been playing in recent times.   Ahmed Ibrahim was a beast in the defense as usual.   Watching this match I think we're good enough to get through the group stage at least because we are better than Jordan and Palestine. We may not get to the semi finals though unless we get lucky and end up against UAE instead of Iran.   I'm worried how we'll do against Japan though. They will not give us much of the ball, and we'll need to work hard defensively against them."

IraqiSoccer,2qyskp,samir5,2,Thu Jan 1 00:22:40 2015 UTC,"No idea. They did have it on the kits they wore a the gulf cup though.  Personally, I think the kits look alot better with the FA logo rather than just having the flag. I can't think of any other country who just puts the flag on the kits."

If he was to transfer to them, they wouldn't be able to stop him from playing for Iraq.   I think this was just another fabricated deal to make Ali Adnan look better in front of the fans."

IraqiSoccer,2qh99d,NoFapMonster,1 point,Sun Dec 28 00:29:08 2014 UTC,"Yeah he's in poor form right now and there's been alot of baseless rumors about him. We'll see how things turn out. I don't think he'll stay where he is though. He was one of their best players last season, and he's still rather young so he it wouldn't be surprising IMO to see him move to another decent european club."
IraqiSoccer,2qbsbt,kratos61,1 point,Thu Dec 25 01:03:37 2014 UTC,"For those of you that saw the match, how did we play? Also who missed our penalty?"
IraqiSoccer,2qbsbt,koorairaqia,1 point,Thu Dec 25 21:56:13 2014 UTC,"The Coach Radhi shnaishel is testing out players, so don't take it as bad news. I was however dissapointed with Ali Bahjat who's performance was pathetic. Hopefully he didn't lose too much confidence after todays performance. I really wish that this is a wake up call for him, we need all the defenders we can get due to Ali Rehema's injury.   Waleed Salem was terrible today. Attacks came from his side all the time, he couldn't hold his side at all. Just terrible. Amjad had to defend a lot to cover up for him, speaking of which.  Amjad Kalaf is quickly becoming an extremely dependable player, the star of the team. Amazing player quick and has a lot of stamina. Hopefully he is picked up by a better club than Al Shorta.   Dhurgham, Ahmed Yasin and Younis are playing really well, very impressive players though that is expected of Younis.   Justin Meram is a good player but is playing by himself and barely passing.   Our biggest weakness is the lack of a playmaker and that the team needs to be in sync. We have decent preparations this time, so hopefully we can get the latter. Hopefully Ali Hosni, Yaser Kasim, Alaa Abdul Zahra (who has been playing around midfield) can deal with the playmaker problem.   I just realized that I didn't really answer your question. We played very differently in the two parts of the game. First half was pathetic, invidual players trying to play football. The second was far better thanks to people like Amjad and Ahmed Yasin. We didn't come on top, but we played well.   In conclusion it was a good friendly game for preparation. No injuries and I believe Radhi learned a lot. Honestly I can already see massive improvements over Hakeem."
IraqiSoccer,2qbsbt,Mesopotamian91,1 point,Fri Dec 26 01:30:40 2014 UTC,"That sounds like good news overall, we just need as many players as possible to be in-form for the match against Jordan, which realistically is our most important game. What is your ideal 23 man squad as of now?"
IraqiSoccer,2q470k,kratos61,2,Mon Dec 22 23:02:06 2014 UTC,"This was Radhi Shnaishel's first test with the national team. The result doesn't really matter IMO since it's nothing more than a practice game before the asian cup. Hopefully this game as well as the next few friendlies give Radhi a good idea of the capabilities and fitness of the players he has.   The legend Younis Mahmoud also proves why we need him so much, winning a penalty and scoring it on his 127th appearance for Iraq."
IraqiSoccer,2q470k,iraqiboy,1 point,Mon Dec 22 23:04:39 2014 UTC,The next couple of matches against Uzbekistan and then with Iran in Australia hopefully get us ready for the Asian cup!
IraqiSoccer,2q470k,Mesopotamian91,1 point,Tue Dec 23 04:13:18 2014 UTC,"It's not a bad result considering the ten men. But I wish Radhi would have changed Marwan with Hammadi Ahmad. I also like how Radhi is trying to end these long balls our defence always plays, I've always hated them. He is a good coach, far better than Hakeem if nothing else.   It's weird how Marwan played brilliantly in the anniversary cup, yet is nothing more than a wasted spot on the pitch right now. I don't know whether he has declined or the team isn't capable of attacking as they should.  Either way we need to be careful, we do however have a good amount of talent. We should be able to win it with some luck."
IraqiSoccer,2q470k,Mesopotamian91,1 point,Wed Dec 24 19:09:04 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, the issue with Marwan is that he simply isn't a good player. The only good performances he's ever had in an Iraqi kit was when he was playing for the olympic and U-22 teams. Those teams are full of overaged players, so in cups like the asian games and the U-22 Asian cup that our team won, he'd be playing with players who range from 22-26 while facing actual youth teams. He no longer has a strength, and experience advantage over the other the opposition players, so he's struggling.   I think of the strikers we have with the team, Younis should be our first choice, and our best back up striker is Alaa Abdul Zahra."

IraqiSoccer,2p9wha,koorairaqia,1 point,Mon Dec 15 04:53:44 2014 UTC,"I don't like seeing noor out of the team because he's a good goalkeeper and a good influence on the team, but I don't mind seeing Karrar out. He's doing great in Iran, but hasn't produced anything of note with the national team in years, plus he seems to be a pretty bad influence on the team and has a bad attitude. We've still got Younis Mahmoud, Salam Shakir and Mehdi Kareem who are all highly experienced and seem like positive influences on the young players."
IraqiSoccer,2p9wha,koorairaqia,1 point,Mon Dec 15 06:03:46 2014 UTC,"That's a fair point, but I still feel as if our midfield would have more of a presence with him in it. And without Nashat either, our mids are all youth players. In regards to goalkeepers, what ever happened to Mohammed Kassid?"

I though he was really good with Wakrah, granted I only watched them when they had half the national team with them. Then they shook up the team in the winter transfer (who even does that) and lost the league.    Radhi Shneshl is an interesting choice and quite a gamble that might pay off.    Radhi was horrible when he was in charge of the olimpic team. What I like about him is that he's open minded and willing to call up European players. That won't win us anything though. If you're talking about tactically lacking coaches, this guy is a great example.   Edit : Bora imo though is the worst choice out of any possible coach."

IraqiSoccer,2mwee3,darmani11,2,Thu Nov 20 23:37:59 2014 UTC,"This is surely the end of Hakeem, it has to be. Horrible tournament. It shows how much we miss Younis. Amjad Radhi and Marwan are just not as good as he is and that is a fact. Pretty pathetic that we are going to have to rely on a man in his 30's without a club for our Asian Cup campaign."
IraqiSoccer,2mwee3,yaseenk,1 point,Thu Nov 20 19:52:32 2014 UTC,"I think we should have brought Alaa Abdul Zahra for this tournament instead of Amjed, who's proven over and over that he isn't good enough to play international football. Alaa never got to play striker at all with the national team.   As for Younis, he is more than just a good striker, he is also a very important personality in the team. He can motivate the players very well, and his presence on the field makes the other players play with more confidence. We'll need him fit for his last Asian cup."
IraqiSoccer,2mwee3,NoFapMonster,1 point,Thu Nov 20 23:28:03 2014 UTC,We go out of the gulf cup having scored one goal and conceding 4. Terrible performance in the matches s UAE and Oman. If this is not enough to get Hakeem out then we have no chance to get out of our asian cup group stage. I've never seen such a tactically inept coach in my life.
IraqiSoccer,2mwee3,koorairaqia,1 point,Thu Nov 20 18:45:40 2014 UTC,Hakim won't be kicked out. He just got a contract extension and the Iraqi FA will not want to pay him 500K as a result of breakage of contract. We are stuck with this idiot for the next three years. Mark my words.
IraqiSoccer,2mtgy5,kratos61,1 point,Wed Nov 19 22:57:05 2014 UTC,Depending on which players are in the starting lineup I think we have a chance...even though it's VERY slim. It would probably be smart to play with just 3 defenders and give Karrar and Hammadi Ahmad more playing time.
IraqiSoccer,2mtgy5,koorairaqia,1 point,Thu Nov 20 02:28:09 2014 UTC,"This is the expected line-up for the game, though it could be a little bit different.   I think Hammadi should be the starting striker with Meram behind him. Hammadi deserves to play more since Amjed Radhi sucks with the national team and Marwan isn't much of an improvement. It would be interesting to see Ahmed Yasin play on the left though. In the first couple games his effect on the attack has been limited since he needed to drop back alot and defend the right side of the defence. If he plays on the left wing, he'll have ali bahjat, naturally a centerback, covering the defence so that could give Ahmed Yasin the chance to attack more.   Our chance is slim. Even if we win, we still need Oman to lose or draw or else we're out. Regardless of what happens, Hakeem needs to be sacked or else we'll be facing more embarrassment at the asian cup."
IraqiSoccer,2mtgy5,koorairaqia,1 point,Thu Nov 20 04:23:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah I agree about having Hammadi play up top, he's the best striker we have without Younis in the current squad. As for the Asian cup, I don't see a winning squad like we had in 2007. I can't see anyone equal or better what Nashat was able to do in the midfield (although Yaser and Humam are improving). We have a fairly young squad and hopefully by the time WCQ comes in, we'll be ready."
IraqiSoccer,2mtgy5,BoneCounted,1 point,Thu Nov 20 04:49:04 2014 UTC,"That's right. I don't think this team is good enough to win the asian cup, but we should be good enough to qualify for the world cup with the right coach. For the next Asian cup I think we can be contenders though since by then our younger players will be entering their primes. I just hope we can get the quarter finals or semi finals of this asian cup."
IraqiSoccer,2moea1,BoneCounted,1 point,Tue Nov 18 16:44:06 2014 UTC,"You pretty much summed up the purpose of this subreddit. I made this subreddit a few months ago since I saw several Iraqi football fans over at /r/soccer and I hadn't found a particularly good site to discuss Iraqi football.   There is already the al iraqi forums where we've got 5-6 people who are actually active in discussion/posting news and stuff, but I don't like the way that site looks or the format. I also noticed that every once in a while the site stops loading up, and can sometime be down for days.   We've got 42 people subscribed here but only 2-3 people who comment sometimes. If more people commented/were active here, I think this subreddit can be exactly what you're describing. It just feels like I'm posting to myself sometimes.   If you want, I can make you a moderator here. I'm the only mod right now so can't always post the latest news here, so if we have multiple people posting and keeping the subreddit up to date it can be better than it is currently. All this sub needs is a few more regular posters/commenters and it can be really good."
IraqiSoccer,2moea1,kratos61,1 point,Wed Nov 19 03:44:10 2014 UTC,"I disagree with you.  This subreddit is completely different from what I had in mind. You cannot even form it the way you'd like. If you think you can do everything you'd like on Reddit, websites wouldn't even be necessary and people would just create a subreddit for their company.  Yes, I know Al Iraqi, but did you know registration has been disabled for about a year or two now (for the time I found out about it)? I've even sent two contact messages, one a year ago and one last month, but it seems like nobody is reading them. I know a guy there, Suren, but his number is on my old sim card, which is broken and inactive. I feel like Al Iraqi is simply dead.  I don't think I'll achieve what I'm trying to achieve when I become a moderator on this subreddit. I'll do my best to stay active here for the time being. So basically, thanks for the offer, but I'll say no for now.  Perhaps, if you could contact other veterans from Al Iraqi, we could start up something together?"
IraqiSoccer,2moea1,why_go_home,2,Wed Nov 19 16:01:26 2014 UTC,"Fair enough.   I guess I don't know what type of site you want to set up, Do you know of a site that is similar to what you have in mind?   I personally think a subreddit like this is perfect for discussion. A full website can get too complicated while a set up like this subreddit is easier to read. I don't really like forums as much either since posting links, pictures, youtube videos isn't as nice and easy as on a subreddit. The whole purpose of a subreddit and reddit in general is for discussion.   Here anybody can create a thread to ask questions, discuss current events, post pictures, etc... You'd be surprised what additional features can be added to this subreddit as well. I've been planning to add a fixture list for the national team + an iraqi league table among other things, but I don't know enough CSS at the moment and I've got some university work in the meantime before I can try and learn some more CSS.   I didn't know that it's no longer possible to make new accounts on aliraqi though. Kind of makes sense though, since it's been the same people who always post there; you never see anyone new. I tried telling people over there about setting something new, or joining this subreddit at least since the aliraqi site is not very good, but everyone seemed happy enough over there."
IraqiSoccer,2moea1,kratos61,2,Wed Nov 19 19:28:07 2014 UTC,"I used to be a regular on aliraqi, but I didn't agree with a lot of what was said on the news forum. If I go there I just stick to the sports section."
IraqiSoccer,2moea1,why_go_home,2,Thu Nov 20 05:34:56 2014 UTC,TBH I didn't even know that there were other forums on aliraqi that were still active. I've never commented outside of the sports section. People in the news section get really crazy sometimes.

IraqiSoccer,2mllht,koorairaqia,1 point,Mon Nov 17 21:57:30 2014 UTC,"Hakeem got lucky with Yaser Kasim's goal. He then played ultra defensively trying to win 1-0, and then played for the draw when Oman equalized. He's a cowardly coach. One of the worst games I've ever seen our team play."

IraqiSoccer,2mbr3b,kratos61,1 point,Fri Nov 14 22:19:12 2014 UTC,"Absolutely ridiculous refereeing, it was a clear handball...Meram should have had his first goal on his debut. And an offside goal from Fahad to top it off."
IraqiSoccer,2mbr3b,koorairaqia,1 point,Fri Nov 14 22:43:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the goal-line technology showed that it was a goal, but the ref didn't count it. If it's not a goal, it's a penalty+red card for the Kuwaiti, but this is just typical garbage refereeing at the gulf cup when we play. Whenever we play in the gulf cup, there's always a few uncalled penalties for us."
IraqiSoccer,2mar57,kratos61,2,Fri Nov 14 17:01:23 2014 UTC,that was a goal/penalty and sendoff. Pissed off

IraqiSoccer,2m9rsk,kratos61,2,Fri Nov 14 09:23:39 2014 UTC,"Columbus Crew supporter here - Can't wait to see Justin play at the national level. Good luck Iraq, we'll be cheering for you!"
IraqiSoccer,2m9rsk,Kaltho,2,Fri Nov 14 16:12:32 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the support :) Justin will be a starter for the game today, so it'll will be really great to see how he does. All of us Iraqis are hoping he replicates some of his form with Columbus Crew for Iraq, alot of his matches in the MLS have been getting attention from Iraqi fans and Media. If he does as well as we expect him to, he'll almost certainly get a call up for the asian cup."
IraqiSoccer,2m9rsk,Kaltho,2,Fri Nov 14 16:26:25 2014 UTC,Awesome. Hope he gets some meathooks for you guys. UNLEASH J9!
IraqiSoccer,2m0r7r,kratos61,1 point,Wed Nov 12 00:12:17 2014 UTC,Any idea why Younis is not called up?
IraqiSoccer,2m0r7r,koorairaqia,1 point,Wed Nov 12 04:06:10 2014 UTC,He got injured so he couldn't make it. At the very least we get to try out a few new strikers instead of him.
IraqiSoccer,2m0r7r,NoFapMonster,1 point,Wed Nov 12 04:12:28 2014 UTC,Mahdi Kareem is the only surviving veteran from 2007.  Well Karar is there a well.

IraqiSoccer,2i79ic,kratos61,2,Fri Oct 3 16:44:59 2014 UTC,This problem has gotten engrained in the mindset of Iraqi football. This happens because the football association want to keep their jobs and keep the people happy so they encourage fabricating ages in order to win some youth Asian tournament. I hope we get banned to learn a lesson.
IraqiSoccer,2hx0zr,kratos61,1 point,Tue Sep 30 19:14:12 2014 UTC,how did we lose to North Korea?  We're supposed to be better than them :(

I'll continue posting them for the rest of the matches, but there aren't any full highlight videos, only videos that just show the goals. Sometimes the full match can be found like for the win against Japan and the game against tajikistan, but that's all."

IraqiSoccer,2fyzg3,NoFapMonster,1 point,Wed Sep 10 21:42:24 2014 UTC,"he's not that bad. It's just his fitness sucks. Runs out of energy way too fast. It doesn't help that he's always played out of position for Iraq. I'm more concerned with the call up for Nashat. He's insanely talented, but he's fat and can't run at all anymore."

IraqiSoccer,2fdtod,Ashys_,1 point,Wed Sep 3 19:25:49 2014 UTC,I don't think we'll be playing armenia. As far as I know we only have the game vs Peru tomorrow. That game will be broad casted by AlIraqia Riyadhiya and I think the regular al iraqiya channel.

IraqiSoccer,2e3nw1,koorairaqia,1 point,Thu Oct 2 01:27:47 2014 UTC,Nothing at all. I don't think he will. I think he'll probably play at this upcoming asian cup and retire completely.
IraqiSoccer,2e3nw1,koorairaqia,1 point,Thu Oct 2 03:51:37 2014 UTC,I don't know if you would consider wikipedia to be accurate but it says he joined Perak FA in Malaysia. I would be surprised if it's true though.
IraqiSoccer,2e1lmr,kratos61,2,Wed Aug 20 02:17:43 2014 UTC,He sounds like a cunt in his interviews.
IraqiSoccer,2e1lmr,why_go_home,2,Wed Aug 20 03:54:49 2014 UTC,He does! I couldn't even finish the interview because it was so cringy and he sounded full of himself.
