hitmanimals,380any,ShadowShine57,63,Sun May 31 22:45:18 2015 UTC,I don't think I have ever seen any animal go to its death as casually as that.
hitmanimals,380any,Fifty_Stalins,24,Sun May 31 23:36:56 2015 UTC,"After watching the source, you will know why"
hitmanimals,380any,bedz01,14,Mon Jun 1 02:18:07 2015 UTC,"Because he was tired, or because by that point he's already wishing for sweet death? Seriously, that whole video is like a real life version of Saw for seals. That's terrifying."
hitmanimals,380any,Bigfrostynugs,5,Mon Jun 1 04:04:46 2015 UTC,"That whale/orca just swims up, grabs the tail, and pulls him slowly... they both knew what was coming... Although I kinda hope the seal swam away when the whale went to eat him"
hitmanimals,380any,Muronelkaz,10,Mon Jun 1 08:54:10 2015 UTC,"No sorry, it gets eaten. If you watch the footage the orcas have been fucking with the seal for a while and it's just physically exhausted at that point."
hitmanimals,380any,Bigfrostynugs,-1,Mon Jun 1 10:55:32 2015 UTC,Yeah orcas fucking suck
hitmanimals,380any,Hayes231,0,Wed Jun 3 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally. I mean I understand eating another animal for sustenance, that's how nature works. But they're just fucking with that seal before they kill it."
hitmanimals,380any,Bigfrostynugs,0,Wed Jun 3 03:33:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I think there was a short documentary about this and other instances of orca dickbaggery. apparently it's most common among groups of juvenile males

hitmanimals,380any,piaknow,4,Mon Jun 1 06:53:32 2015 UTC,"(Reposting myself from last time I saw this.)  ""Hey, Chauncey! C'mon, stop that moping. We're taking you out.""    ""O-out?"" Chauncey's flippers flittered nervously. ""Out where, Gary?""    ""Oh, hey, wow, bad wording on my part. I'm sorry. No, not that kind of out."" Gary tried to stifle a smile, but Greg and Phil could be heard softly chuckling from the next cubicle. ""Out. To the bar--we're taking you for drinks. You need to stop moping over her, man."" ""No... No, I don't think so."" Chauncey let his chin rest on the desk. ""I think I just want to go home.""    ""C'mon, man. You can't keep moping over her.""    I can and I will, thought some part of Chauncey's brain.    Greg poked his snout over the cubicle wall and regarded Chauncey with a fake eye nestled near the real one. ""C'moooon. Come oooonnn. It's karoke night at Davy Jones' Locker!""    ""I...""    ""And Shelia will be there,"" Greg sing-songed.    ""What?!"" Chauncey nearly fell off his chair. Not Shelia! She was way out of his league, with those beautiful black eyes, that soft white fur.... The sudden movement spurred him to finish tidying up his cubicle and shutting down for the day. He always hated arriving in the morning to a messy cubicle. ""No, I just--no. Look, guys. I appreciate it, but I'm just going to hop a float and go home.""    ""BOOOOOOOOOOO!"" called Phil from somewhere near the vending machines.    Within moments, before he could be further tempted, Chauncey had made his way out of the office, and was waiting for the next ice float to come along.    Gary sighed and looked at Greg and Phil. ""Guys, we need to do something. He's been in this funk for three weeks. She wasn't worth it, man! He's better than her!""    ""I know, right? But, what can we do? It's not like we can just drag him to the Locker.""    There was a moment of thoughtful, solemn silence, and then Gary began to smile. ""Oh? Can't we?""    EPILOGUE: Chauncey and Shelia went on to win the local Karoke Kings prize, and placed fifth in regionals. They just celebrated their sixth wedding anniversary, surrounded by three adopted children--two penguins and a walrus. Chauncey continues to be friends with Greg, Phil and Gary, and Shelia has kept her promise to never eat Chauncey or their children."
