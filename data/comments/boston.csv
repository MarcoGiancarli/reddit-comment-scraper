If anything, I've seen that some kids are not ready for full-day K, especially if they didn't do half-day pre-K.

boston,3dyg6b,beacon_street,158,Mon Jul 20 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"Here is a little back story on this guy. He is seen as a joke around Billerica and is supported by some of the crazies, townies and tea partiers. He painted his own signs for his election and if you've seen them, you might judge his ability as a professional painter. One of his painted signs he painted himself had his name misspelled. If you've seen him driving around town, you may have noticed him playing a trumpet while controlling the steering wheel with his knees.   A few years ago, 2010 or 2011 the town was going to receive funding to completely redo the Billerica town center. If you've been through the center, it is a mess. He made an online video which caught attention of many from the town and rallied many people to vote against having the town center redesigned. He spread misinformation and town hall did a poor job correcting this information. The redesign had the support of the local business that are in the center and are tricky to get too if you don't know the area. The redesign would have eliminated the rotary and made Boston road 2 ways each direction and would have had proper turn lanes to river street and andover road. 20 percent MORE green space would have been added to the area and a lot of angled parking was going to be added on each side of the road to accommodate usage of that green space and for the business.     The current ""construction"" going on in town center now is bringing every thing up to safety standards. Added brick crosswalks with flashing lights. Town center is 3 lanes northbound in that section and many pedestrian accidents almost happened daily because one car stops for a person in the crosswalk and another keeps going. It is near the high school, so there is a lot of pedestrian traffic. Bump outs have been added to sidewalks and there are future plans to extend the sidewalks and cross walk redesign down 3A by the mall.     The work being down now is a the middle ground the town and the selectmen came to, which isn't really much. As for him painting the crosswalks, that was on the contractor to paint, but there have been delays. So George was witnessed buying paint at the nearby hardware store, which isn't the correct paint to be using for the roadway. It was not designed for road use, maybe a bedroom that doesn't get rained on, but not the road. Then there is the environmental impact of its run off, then the safety issue. Slippery after it rains. It isn't done in accordance with safety standards. He painted on a town AND state road.     Now he has supporters. One guy on 3A decided to paint a fire hydrant on Boston road today and left a sign saying ""I painted this fire hydrant, arrest me, [name signed]."" Billerica doesn't use red hydrants, but this guy decided to take the black and yellow[recently painted] hydrant and paint it red. Now hydrant colors are town/city specific, but the town uses the hydrant colors to know their function[High pressure vs low pressure, maybe even the DPW's hydrants].    Edit - grammar"

He constantly spreads false information to further his own misguided beliefs. He set the town back 50 years by starting his stupid campaign to ""save Billerica center"" instead of improving traffic flow, creating more green space, and allowing local restaurants in the center like the Mangia Mangia to have patio seating and creating more business. He told lies about the high school plans, and now the town is back at step 1 for building a new high school that the town desperately needs. The man is mentally unstable, and unfit to be an elected official. And if you have ever seen any of his paint work, you'd know he's far from professional. The guy is a nut, and needs to stop ruining my town. We're already known as a town filled with heroine addicts and the worst school buildings in the area, do we really want to be seen as that town that never improves?   On the topic of this latest incident, the town has a contract with a company that paints the crosswalks. Once construction is completed, the contractor will paint the crosswalks the appropriate color, using the correct paint. Violating this contract will cost the town a lot more than power washing the mess that Simolaris made."

boston,3dyg6b,MrFusionHER,72,Tue Jul 21 02:41:14 2015 UTC,"I read the comments on the article, and a lot of people don't seem to understand why the city needed to remove the paint.  There are serious legal implications if he used the wrong type of paint, wrong color, or wrong dimensions.    Colors have very specific meanings in traffic applications and are often restricted in their use to prevent confusion.  If someone mis-interprets the meaning of a sign or road marking because the wrong color was used, the city is liable.    There are special paints that have retro-reflective properties so they can be seen at night and in the rain.  If a flat paint is used, a driver may not see the crosswalk, but a pedestrian thinks it's clearly marked.  Also, pavement paint is designed to prevent the surface from becoming slick, which is a safety hazard.  In short, the reason the selectman is in trouble is because he exposed the city to a lot of liability."
boston,3dyg6b,scranston,10,Mon Jul 20 16:33:51 2015 UTC,"In short, the reason the selectman is in trouble is because he exposed the city to a lot of liability.   Then why doesn't the city have any liability when they allow the crosswalk to completely fade away in the first place?"
boston,3dyg6b,rox0r,4,Mon Jul 20 17:45:53 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between active and passive actions.  There is typically a schedule for road maintenance.  If the crosswalks faded before they're scheduled to be repainted, the town isn't liable as long as they're on the schedule and the repainting schedule is in line with industry practices.  The Selectman actively went out and did something that is contrary to standard industry practices, which can be legally seen as ""creating an unsafe condition"".  Since the Selectman is a representative of the city, the city can be held liable for his actions."
boston,3dyg6b,scranston,0,Mon Jul 20 19:43:21 2015 UTC,"the town isn't liable as long as they're on the schedule and the repainting schedule is in line with industry practices.

boston,3dyg6b,msdebacle,6,Tue Jul 21 01:34:31 2015 UTC,"Transportation is difficult because conditions are always changing. Standards are always changing. And on top of that budgets are limited and cities have to make hard decisions about where to spend money and where to hold off.   There has to be industry standards because there isn't the money to fix everything. You may see a crosswalk that isn't painted, but there are also potholes, and resurfacing, and capital works that have to share a budget.   This is what the gas tax pays for.  The same gas tax that was finally indexed and the good people of this state decided to repeal the idea of reasonably finding road improvements."

Billerica center is an absolute joke to navigate through and having a faded cross walk only make It harder for pedestrians to get through. It should have been painted when he notified them.

boston,3dyg6b,batmansmotorcycle,16,Mon Jul 20 16:50:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, the MUTCD (fed rules on traffic design) suggests that all crosswalk markings and signs ""should be inspected at least once a year and replaced as needed.""

boston,3dyg6b,mtrem225,7,Mon Jul 20 22:15:25 2015 UTC,"All these other comments make good points. The selectman was understandibly upset the crosswalks hadn't been replaced yet, but I also understand why the town would want them removed - don't want to set a precedent, the markings weren't the right material or reflectivity, etc.  Most towns don't paint crosswalks anymore; they use thermoplastic, which is pretty much a tape you lay down, heat it (and the road under it) to extreme temperatures, then let it cool. Installation takes minutes, not hours; the treatment has a texture (so cars feel it when they drive over it) and has bits of reflective material in it so that they are lit up when cars approach. Lots of regular pavement markings use this as well (it lasts MUCH longer than paint, which fades every couple years). The Town presumably will be installing these when they do eventually get to it, so I understand why they didn't want crappy paint crossings, but they do need to get moving on providing a permanent solution fast now that the spotlight is on them."

It's not his purview to create traffic marking, simple as that. Especially with paint from a hardware store. So even if the city is taking it's sweet time doing this shit, there is a set process outside of regular maintenance that residents have to deal with this. City council meetings, the mayors constituent line, local papers, etc. And since he is a selectman, he can easily get a meeting with the mayor or his chief of staff and the head of the local dpw."

If I have to choose between the model of MA commonwealth where unions protect the workers and model of Texas where companies exploit the workers, I would choose the former.  Unions come with their own share of problem, but they have been responsible for vast majority of the good working conditions of workers in America. The business owners didn't provide good working conditions out of their good heart.  So yeah it is getting old. Most of the union bashers are anyway dumb people who selectively look for something wrong in unions, but keep ignoring the good work unions have done in the last 100 years.  Before you say that unions were good in the past but in these days they don't make sense. People have been saying the same for last 100 years. Plus, the rise of part-time jobs have increased after unions have become weaker."
boston,3dyg6b,Mitch_from_Boston,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:52:57 2015 UTC,"The number one complaint I hear about unions is you can never fire an employee no matter how bad they are. Yet my gf works at a state college and they have let go of state union employees when they repeatedly violate written rules and are documented to have not improved. The difference seems to be with a union the rules are written down and followed (and the manager can't be a lazy sack of shit but has to document infractions), whereas in Texas you can be fired for any reason (maybe even an injury) at any time with no recourse, guilty or innocent, and since almost every job position is becoming an ""independent contractor"" in TX you get no unemployment, no disability, etc. I lived there, I was part of a team  of engineers that was let go with no notice and no severance at the height of the recession, even though the manager knew this was coming for most of a year.  I've never been in a union and I chafe against regulations bought by trade unions, but I'll take MA over TX any day."

If the choice is between workers holding lot of power and management holding a lot of power, I would choose the former.  I too have never ben in a union, but again I have also never had extra-marital affairs, neither am I homosexual, but just not experiencing it doesn't mean I can't support people who are into it.   We all want to do good things, selfless things. So I support unions (even though some of unions can become too-big-to-fail) because I support the workers who do not have the same quality of life as me and its only the union which helps them"

I think the biggest thing for you is making a really god bar with a good gaming atmosphere, not making a great gaming area that serves beer. My friends would go to the former, but it would be a struggle for the latter."
boston,3e0h4f,Mitch_from_Boston,6,Tue Jul 21 04:46:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, I really think that making a place that is primarily a hangout spot that serves beer is the key to success here.   One of the main concerns most pointed out for the closure of the other Mana Bar site was the fact that it was just way too small to look inviting. It had very little seating and just wasn't relaxing at all.   The primary thing you should be focusing on is, marketing. The Boston area is a huge hub for the kind of people that would be interested in this, but if it's small and cramped, then people won't want to come. I would highly suggest Boston instead of Providence due to the fact that there is a much better public transportation system and more people in the area that could possibly want to go.  Also, once you decided on Boston or Providence, you should look into the exact kind of license you want to get so that it matches your description of your venue. Will you be serving snacks as well? In Providence that's either a Class BV or Class ED, which could probably affect the closing times of the bar as well, now that it could be considered a restaurant.   Venue should be really important as well. I would highly suggest if you are going to do this, you need to get a large enough area for couches, beanbags, etc. Something that will allow people to be in a relaxed environment and not be ""forced"" to sit in a barstool and play games. Maybe even one section that is a theater for large events/tournaments? Or an area for tabletop gaming as well.  Another thing I saw a few people comment about while looking up the Mana Bar was the fact that it closed at 11pm, which is a major problem when you are catering to gamers.  I am hugely passionate about eSports, I worked behind the scenes at MLG including Providence, Raleigh, Orlando, and Dallas events and if you need any help in any way let me know."
boston,3e0h4f,iAMDev,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:33:59 2015 UTC,"Good point.  2am closing time wouldn't fly.  You need at minimum a 6am closing time if not 24hrs.

boston,3dz3ev,Mitch_from_Boston,2,Tue Jul 21 03:58:19 2015 UTC,According to the article:  .81 cents per dollar back on $20 to $30 tickets.   .70 cents per dollar back on $1 to $5 tickets.   The incentive here is to make players think they are winning and let them stay active.
boston,3dz3ev,HumanChicken,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:58 2015 UTC,"In my experience as a convenience store clerk in my teens, the minimum payout on a winning ticket will be the price of that ticket.

boston,3dz3ev,user2196,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"It mentioned that the odds of breaking even climb to 1/2.79 in one of the games. That makes winning not too atypical, even more so if you add in some ""wins"" that are less than breaking even."
boston,3dz3ev,nend,2,Mon Jul 20 21:00:58 2015 UTC,It appears that 1/2.79 was the chance of winning anything (they don't offer prizes below breaking even).  You can check the chance of winning any prize a ticket offers on the mass lottery site.    That puts the % of tickets that win a prize at ~36%  Here's one for a $1 ticket where the chance of winning a prize is only 1/4.82 (~21%).  The typical experience with scratch tickets is definitely winning nothing.
boston,3dz3ev,WerkinAndDerpin,5,Tue Jul 21 00:02:59 2015 UTC,Looks like $30/$20 scratch have the same avg return as $10s. Interesting.
boston,3dz3ev,mysaadlife,5,Mon Jul 20 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"As someone who works in a convenience store this seems about right. Keno and Scratch tickets are most popular with our customers because you usually win the money back and it's immediate. Then again, there are people who will easily spend 200-300 dollars a day on the stuff and then will complain about the lottery owing them money."
boston,3dz3ev,marksam40,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:45 2015 UTC,"Most if not all these odds are in fact much lower than the listed return because if you win a large amount, you get taxed on your winnings. Also, I'm not sure but they probably take the structured payment amount over x years and ignore the time value of money, so if you won $20 million over 20 years, the present value is much less than $20"

Your landlord certainly seems incredibly difficult. I'd suggest another conversation with her
boston,3dzijw,mtang1982,2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:41 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, she can enter to show the apartment and she can require it kept clean enough to not attract vermin or cause damage to her property.  That said, there's a lot of sketch going on. The first red flag for me in your post: You don't have a closet. You're not renting a legal bedroom. That alone is enough info for me to infer that this landlord gives nary a shit about what the law says she can and cannot do.  Read up on your rights and insist on them. Usually landlords like this assume you don't know the law and are going to take full advantage of that, all you need to do is show them you're actually knowledgeable. (There's a chance they don't know the law, as well—but as they say, ignorance is no excuse.)"

I do have a window though so it seems like it's probably legally OK to call a bedroom?  Still, I would agree there's some questionably legal stuff happening as it is (as in most places in Boston).

Warren for example calls herself an advocate for minority rights yet she checked a box saying she was a Native American when applying to school. I wonder why, and I wonder whether she has kept the millions she has made ""fighting for the little people."" Has she allocated a majority of these millions to ""lift people out of poverty."" These politicians are all the same."

If that's the most damning thing for a Mass politician then I'd be fucking glad about it.   I'd be more worried that your measuring stick is the amount of personal money a candidate has spent to alleviate poverty. It's not the dark ages, we aren't serfs and it isn't the role (not to mention highly illegal) of candidate to dole out personal funds. Anti-poverty measures can only effectively be applied at State and Federal levels, and one would assume a well-regarded bankruptcy lawyer would be a decent fit in that discussion.   You don't have to like the Senator, but you don't need a reason for disliking her. Stop trying to gin some hazy legitimacy for it. I fucking detest the town of Belmont for example, no good reason, just hate it. Completely irrational, but at least I don't try and torture a half-assed justification for it."

But you're right, the entire thing is a distraction from a discussion on her merits.   The reason I dislike her is she's painted herself as a crusader against the big evil banks, but she hasn't done anything to show that she has even a basic knowledge of how an investment bank works. She repeats the same tired soundbites, which get shared on social media, and make everyone like her, but she couldn't even get through a press conference during her campaign. If someone wants to fix the issues in the financial system, I don't want broad sweeping statements about how things ""should"" be; I want hard facts and numbers. Except she doesn't have those, and if she does, she doesn't act like it.   Jamie Dimon was an asshole when he said she didn't know anything, but that doesn't mean he was wrong. I haven't looked into Bernie Sanders' economic ideas yet, but as it stands now, I'm leaning toward voting for him, at least in the primary. Warren would have to demonstrate some competency before I would even consider putting her on my ballot."
boston,3dzdyq,allnose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"She has decades of experience in commercial law - I think it's a safe assumption she understands the principles of investment banking, at least the committee hearings she's active in would attest to it - but more importantly, she'd appear to understand the netherworld between law and economic impact, as that's her field of study and Harvard doesn't give out tenure to just anybody (including natives).  Her role as a Senator isn't to run the banks, it's (in a perfect world), it's to make sure that an obscure instrument like default swaps doesn't metastasize into an all-encompassing economic downturn through better legislation. A first time, potentially internally divisive politician doesn't ascend to be a ranking member in a marquee senate subcommittee on verve alone (one would hope at the very least).   Now all that's neither here nor there - I think our current banking system is here to stay for awhile longer like it or not. Now what I do really like about her has nothing to do with economic populism, it's that her and Jack Reed are the only New England pols within the banking committee which, because why make it simple, also houses the subcommittee for urban affairs and...mass transit (though only Reed sits), which I barrack this poor sub about. That subcommittee is dawdling over transit issues in the Senate's version of transpo bill, there's been an idea floating around for a while of one-off tax repatriation holiday (and ensuing charge) that could fund a round proper transit investment (since there hasn't been a long-term funding plan for over 5 years). That idea is only possible with support of her and her colleagues and I really want that deal. If not her then Capuano sits in the House version, but he's got no power down there. So by process of elimination, she's in the position that I'd want for our politicians - the Big Dig would never have happened if Tip O'Neil hadn't been so powerful and politically astute."

And if course, that raises both her popularity and standing in the party. I might prefer someone who says ""we need to lower the threshold for acceptable risk,"" but that doesn't get headlines the same way someone saying ""We need to break up the banks!"" does.   As for the transportation bill process you mentioned, I didn't know any of that, thank you. That's really interesting, how that's working.

He is nobody. He is a loser.""  I don't see a similarity at all in those respects. Donald Trump wants to build a wall, ice relationships with China, and thinks McCain is no war hero because he was captured while in combat. To me, all of those things paint the picture of a man who is not grounded in reality. He also compulsively feels the need to tell everyone how rich he is.

The problem with college costs are the colleges taking advantage of the fact there is a glue of cheap money and loans offered and added to fact they push degrees with little to no return on their investment.  All I see from her is empty gestures and platitutdes.  I know she's Reddit little darling, but as our senator I think she has sucked ass since she's been in there. Look at the bills/motions she's sponsored or Co sponsored. Absolute fluff and bullshit.

I'm middle class and I got hammered, she was fucking as useful as tits on a bull during this whole thing.   I only have a passing familiarity with the Biggert / Waters Floor Zoning act, but from what little I know, it impacted the South Shore because of these new flood plans/maps making them have to pay for more expensive coverage.  I looked up her voting record on the act and it says she voted to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the act. Further googling reveals a YouTube video of her talking in the senate on behalf of homeowners like you who were placed in a flood zone the first time because of the act.   I'm not trying to refute your stated opinions on her, but coming from someone who'd like to be more informed on the matter, what exactly is it about her involvement with the act that rubbed you the wrong way?  Looking further into her voting record, it looks like she also voted to pass the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 (HR 3370) last year, which is supposed to help homeowners impacted by the new flood maps through the following provisions:   • Creates a firewall on annual rate increases – Prevents FEMA from raising the average rates for a class of properties above 15% and from raising rates on individual policies above 18% per year for virtually all properties.  • Repeals the property sales trigger – Repeals the provision in Biggert-Waters that required homebuyers to pay the full-risk rate for pre-FIRM properties at the time of purchase. This provision caused property values to steeply decline and made many homes unsellable, hurting the real estate market. Under the Menendez/Grimm Bill, homebuyers will receive the same treatment as the home seller.  • Repeals the new policy sales trigger – Repeals the provision in Biggert-Waters that required pre-FIRM property owners to pay the full-risk rate if they voluntarily purchase a new policy. This provision disincentivizes property owners from making responsible decisions and could hurt program participation. The Menendez/Grimm Bill allows pre-FIRM property owners to voluntarily purchase a policy under pre-FIRM conditions.  • Reinstates grandfathering – Repeals the provision in Biggert-Waters that would have terminated grandfathering. If grandfathering was terminated, property owners mapped into higher risk would have to either elevate their structure or have higher rates phased in over 5 years. The Menendez/Grimm Bill allows grandfathering to continue and sets hard caps on how high premiums can increase annually.  • Refunds homeowners who overpaid – Requires FEMA to refund policyholders for overpaid premiums.  • Affordability goal – Requires FEMA to minimize the number of policies with annual premiums that exceed one percent of the total coverage provided by the policy.   ^ I'm not really familiar with your specific circumstances as a property/homeowner and whether the above provisions will help you or not (I hope it does at least to some degree!)"
boston,3dzdyq,I_am_BEOWULF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:53 2015 UTC,"Let me add some additional thoughts on this, past my too little too late.   She initially voted on the act, which is mainly to help refund FEMA flood insurance pool after Sandy and Katrina. The flood zone maps were hastily redrawn and as a result many people who never flooded before now have to pay incredibly  high flood insurance. That's what the original law did and she voted for it not giving two shits either way or understanding her constituent base.   The measures she later hopped on board were not drafted by her, written by her, yes she helped pushed them but that's her job.   Also the measures add little or no relief and don't address the fact that the flood zones were mapped wrong to begin with. All these measures do is kick the can down the road. Ask residents in Quincy or Marshfield how the measures worked for her. Three years from now my flood insurance kicks up to $2k on top of my regular insurance, and that's with me not owning a lot on my mortgage to boot. Good luck selling my house if I want to.  It's not just this, it's other bills and her lack of focus on what's good for Massachusetts residents and not just what's good for the Democratic Party.   I can look at her scramble after the fact with the medical devices tax she voted for. Poor judgement considering the key exports from this state.   She knows her shit about banking and consumer protection, but little else it seems with regard to the state she was sent to represent.   At least with Kennedy and Kerry they did a lot for this state and were not just a talking head railing on about a few topics or taking easy softball tosses at easy targets.   Just like the student loan issue and debt bubble. Her measures do nothing to address the real cost, which ironically she played a part of by example."

boston,3dwafx,nadeemtron,4,Tue Jul 21 12:34:35 2015 UTC,"A bit off topic, but.  What I don't get, with say the Russian or British Olympics, it seems the whole financial might of the country gets involved.  That doesn't seem to be the case for Boston. Why."
boston,3dwafx,cabal,4,Mon Jul 20 13:09:05 2015 UTC,"A big part of this is because the US is a federation of states, each with their own independent financial situations, plans, and priorities. And while the federal government also has a vested financial interest, most of the states, especially those outside of NE, do not.   Unlike in England or Russia where there is less separation between economics on a county level (or republic level) vs federal level, in the US there is a huge division between federal and state level economics."
boston,3dwafx,cpxh,6,Mon Jul 20 13:43:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's a difference of size of country in the case of England, and culture in the case of Russia.   England is small enough that if something as big as the Olympics is going to happen in country, the whole country will pitch in.   Russia's culture (read: government) wants to look as good as possible in the public eye at all times. They take immense pride in their athletes and want to show them off, so government wants to be as well funded as possible.  The U.S. is a larger country and has an incredible difference in economies, city to city, as well as rivalries between cities. Do you think New York would want to pay to have the Olympics in Boston? Or that Detroit could afford to help pay for the Olympics in the U.S.? I think the U.S. government would be ecstatic to have it here, but there are more important things to worry about, so it's best left to the cities to handle."
boston,3dwafx,figmaxwell,6,Mon Jul 20 13:21:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There's not a clear federal strategy, from the perspective of municipal officials at least. And many in the Commonwealth (and many state legislators) seem to feel that we would be unwise to absorb this debt on that level. Also it would take an enormous commitment to improve public infrastructure without displacing people based on class/race/etc. (which is kind of what the Olympics does, historically). And people are kind of starting to wonder: ""Hey if it's even remotely possible to organize questions around all this public infrastructure...why didn't we have that already?"" I'm sure there's a million answers...none of them really acceptable."

Or they think they made mistakes in Book 1 and they don't want to talk about past mistakes when they are working off Book 2 now which doesn't include those. Their motive would be to keep the narrative on track and avoid unneeded conversations, but in doing so they actually created a bigger situation that requires and even bigger conversation because the whole act of holding back Book 1's chapters SEEMS sketchy, even if it's not or for a simple reason."

You can't have such an important process and keep the public part for after it is a foregone conclusion. This is why people are distrustful of special interests, I believe. So later, even when they released parts of it, the earlier opacity had already done too much damage. Just made the whole thing look really shady. Double shady, if you will.

boston,3dxtia,do-i-have-to,14,Mon Jul 20 16:35:30 2015 UTC,"Lawyer here.  Bail is not meant to be punitive.  Bail is based on the accused's likelihood of showing up for trial, usually with other conditions attached in addition to the posting of bail (in this case, he will probably be prohibited from contacting the victim as one condition of his bail).  Criteria used to calculate bail include the accused's ties to the community, access to money or other resources that could aid him in fleeing the jurisdiction, the severity of the crime and likely sentence to be imposed for said crime, and whether or not the accused has shown up for his or her trial in the past, among other factors.  While I agree that this guy is probably a reprehensible piece of human garbage, until he's actually convicted the state is prohibited from punishing him.  EDIT: What happened to your friend is ridiculous, and is more of a symptom of an out of control drug war than any of the criteria for which bail should be set.

boston,3dz0re,SantaAdj,2,Mon Jul 20 21:40:05 2015 UTC,I'm curious to hear your argument
boston,3dz0re,amfarrell,-5,Mon Jul 20 21:52:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, but you better take responsibility when the downvote torrent arrives.  The main issue is that there's never actually been an anonymous study of how many Uber drivers are uncaught rapists. In theory, Uber better allows you to track down criminal drivers. However, there needs to be data to confirm that this means fewer rapes on Uber. There could be other intervening factors. For example, it could be that due to low reporting rates there is still not enough of a deterrent to prevent Uber drivers from committing rapes.  I could shore up this argument some more, but I'm going to sleep instead. Night."
boston,3dz0re,SantaAdj,-4,Tue Jul 21 02:11:12 2015 UTC,I think what this is highlighting is that maybe Uber's background checks aren't thorough enough if someone with this kind of history can be an Uber driver.
boston,3dz0re,jitaroo,5,Mon Jul 20 22:14:47 2015 UTC,He didn't have any criminal history.  He was DNA matched to the earlier assaults because he was caught this time.
boston,3dz0re,Se7en_speed,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:26:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, that wasn't clear to me in the article, I thought they hadn't done a background check/ it hadn't shown up on the check"
boston,3dz0re,jitaroo,4,Mon Jul 20 22:42:18 2015 UTC,"Just because he's done the crimes doesn't mean that he had a paper trail for Uber to track. When they caught him after the rape he committed on the Uber passenger, it wasn't until then that they had his identified DNA on file to compare against the previous rapes.  On top of that, there sometimes isn't a lot that makes some rapists ""stick out"". Many of them are people you'd consider normal citizens.  Not all people display their level of fucked up on the outside. Extra screening isn't going to find these people unless they have a documented legal history.   While it is really shitty that the Uber passenger had to be the one that caused him to be found, it is because of Uber that this poor excuse for a human being is going to rot in jail."

boston,3dv8zb,alcesAlcesShirasi,7,Sun Jul 19 21:29:31 2015 UTC,I don't know what the story is with that space.  It took them a really long time to open and then their plan (artisan seltzer and soda bar) seemed too thin for a prime location.  I don't think that they own that building so if they were carrying the rent during build-out it would be a burden.  Sorry to see Johnny's go.
boston,3dv8zb,Toiretachi,3,Sun Jul 19 21:45:11 2015 UTC,I believe that Kindred was part of the family that owns Johnny's and so as the article says they own the entire building.

The reality is that Tufts has the endownment to invite a substantial number of middle and lower class students like myself. The reality is the $50K tuition is only the list price and not the legitimate price.  Furthermore, Davis is much too far away to be a common living space for Tufts students. I'm going to be a senior and I could not name a single student who lives within a 5 minute walk from Davis. Perhaps grad students might live there, but I feel as if that's another discussion entirely as they are not paying the same $50K tuition.

boston,3dv8zb,buriedinthenude,2,Mon Jul 20 05:58:08 2015 UTC,"Well, a 45 minute walk away from campus would be pretty far, don't you think? That's the equivalent of attending Tufts while living in Harvard Square and walking every day. You could do it, but no one does that, and there's a reason why.  Davis is more like a 15-20 minute walk from Tufts, depending on the part of campus you're heading too. Is that too far to walk everyday? Absolutely not, it's not bad at all, however, despite being in a semi-urban area, Tufts has a very defined campus feel to it and most students understandably want to be near campus to take advantage of that. From personal experience, most Tufts students spend most of their time on or very close to campus. We really don't go into Boston that much, so the draw of being closer to the T is somewhat marginal.  Plus, rent near Tufts, particularly on the Medford side of campus, is much cheaper than in Davis, so it doesn't make any sense for students to pay more to live further away from campus..."
boston,3dv8zb,WinsingtonIII,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:06:17 2015 UTC,"I have downvoted you for your sarcastic tone and lack of content.  From a meta perspective yes, Davis is too far to host any more than a token number of Tufts student when there are closer options available. Is it actually too far too far as to not be a housing option? No of course not.   Heck, I have a friend who commutes in via the green line 0.o . That's an hour commute plus. But in a discussion on where tufts students live she is the exception to the rule."
boston,3dv8zb,Apprentice57,-1,Mon Jul 20 08:08:03 2015 UTC,Davis is much too far away to be a common living space for Tufts students.   What? It's a 10-15 min walk from Davis to any part of Tufts campus. Even less if you take the shuttle.
boston,3dv8zb,carbonatedsemen,2,Mon Jul 20 14:17:01 2015 UTC,"That's enough to make it uncommon though. And it definitely is only a 15 mins to the closest part of campus, probably 20 minutes average. 10-15 max is an overesrimate.   Waiting for the shuttle means 5-10 minute wait plus 3 min ride. It's significant enough.   Both of those are entirely do able, but there are much better and cheaper options available.  https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/3dv8zb/slug/ct9olxx explains it well too."
boston,3dv8zb,Apprentice57,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:33:42 2015 UTC,"I walk through your damn campus every day to and from work and can get to/from Davis in 15mins.  The whole idea that undergrads do not live off campus, especially around Davis because it it is to far or to expensive is total bs. Through grad students I know I have met quite a few undergrads living in and around Davis.  Can I accompany you on your first day of a real job when you suddenly realize you have a 2 hour commute. I want to watch the meltdown."
boston,3dv8zb,carbonatedsemen,2,Mon Jul 20 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"Undergrads do live off campus, however, almost none of them live in Davis. I get that you have anecdotal experience via meeting a couple undergrads who live in Davis, but I never knew any Tufts undergrads who lived in Davis when I was there for four years.  Here's how living situations generally break down for Tufts undergrads:  1) Freshman and Sophomore year: On campus housing. I never met anybody who lived off campus as an underclassman.  2) Junior year: 50% of the class goes abroad, other 50% lives off campus, primarily on the East and North sides of campus (the cheaper Medford sides) with significant presence on the streets immediately bordering the South and West sides, but quickly dropping off such that if you get even 2 or 3 blocks away from Tufts the number of students starts to drop off very quickly.  3) Senior year: most students live in the same areas described in number 3, but a good chunk (maybe 25%) do still live on campus as well.  There are certainly lots of Tufts students around Davis at pretty much all times, because it isn't far from campus, but that doesn't mean they live there. Most of those students you see around Davis live on campus or within a few blocks of campus. That's just how it is, and there's a reason I never met any undergrads who lived in Davis, because it's very rare. Admittedly it's been a few years since I graduated, so maybe things have changed a bit."

boston,3dv8zb,buriedinthenude,0,Mon Jul 20 05:55:50 2015 UTC,"You're arguing that Tufts students are so wealthy as to be living in Davis, driving up the rents, and then making the area more trendy in your original comment. Here you're arguing the opposite, that we should look into less expensive options if Davis is too expensive.  I have downvoted you for contradicting me instead of actually picking a point and sticking with you. Again you are not contributing to the discussion as so.  For the record, I do live in Medford and Tufts was the cheapest option for me for colleges (even including a state school as an option). Rents still have gone up by $100/person/month in the past 3 years on average, and that has given me difficulty in paying it."

boston,3dv8zb,Apprentice57,2,Mon Jul 20 08:15:26 2015 UTC,"Tufts students don't live in Davis, at least not the undergrads, but probably not the grad students either.  I personally did not know anyone during my four years at Tufts who lived in Davis, everyone lived much closer to the university itself, and at least when I was there, rent close to Tufts was much lower than in Davis (particularly on the Medford side of campus). Plus, keep in mind Tufts guarantees on campus housing for freshmen and sophomores, and pretty much all underclassmen live on campus (in fact, I believe freshmen have to live on campus). Then, junior year, about 50% of the class goes abroad, meaning there is only a population of about 600 students looking for housing off campus each semester, leaving senior year as the only time the majority of a Tufts' class lives off campus.  So no, I don't think it's the Tufts students driving up the rent in Davis, because they aren't the ones living there. I do know some recent Tufts grads who moved closer to Davis once they got jobs, but even then, they were generally living as roommates in older split level houses.  I would argue the real reason rent in Davis is going up is that relatively well-off couples in their 30's seem to be moving out of areas closer to Boston to get somewhat cheaper rent in the Davis area so they can get more space for their money when they want to have kids, while remaining in an urban environment right off of the T. These families may snap up an entire level of a split level, which previously would have held 3 or 4 people, or even the entire house, which significantly reduces supply for everyone else."

Go to tool/hardware stores, woodcraft, rockler, etc.  It took a month, but I found 300 sq ft of space for 400 a month that includes all the tooling I could ever use.

While I have only been to a handful, people seem to enjoy both Bond at the Langham as well as the Oak Room at the Fairmont.  Ritziest restaurants (talking super expensive, but very good) are either Menton (Ft. Point) or L'Espalier in Back Bay.   In Ft. Point (near south station) - if you aren't trying to break the bank, I'd suggest Bastille Kitchen which has a classy atmosphere and might be a good speed for you guys. After dinner, the restaurant has a place called Chalet (downstairs) which also caters to an upper class clientele.  The hotel Revere has a swanky roof-deck / pool which you might like.   Its a bit tough during the summer, since people generally don't wear suits, especially on weekends, but hopefully this helps."

It's a refreshing honesty in light of practically every other unhealthy restaurant and food product that tries to convince you that it is in some way good for you.  tl;dr Hardee's is honest; if you eat there every day you will die soon.

The Panera in Harvard has a reasonable amount of seating, and the one in Porter a bit less so but still good if you can get it. Diesel in Davis will make you pay for the WiFi part, but it does have the advantage of a ton of seating.   One of my favorite tricks as a graduate student living in Somerville (but attending another Boston area university) was to hang out at the Tufts library. They're open today until 10pm. You can register for WiFi access and there's tons of space. They even have a little cafe but you can also always bring a snack or two and a water bottle; nobody will scold you for eating if you're quiet about it and tucked away in a carrel somewhere. Good luck!"

boston,3dvynb,Kirean,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:39:47 2015 UTC,"Psychologists generally have an academic doctorate in psychology, and are trained in the ways of the mind and behavior.  They can help deal with your feelings and emotions by developing coping mechanisms and working through your problems on an intimate level.  They cannot prescribe medication, as they are not a medical doctor.  They have a Psy.D.  Psychiatrists generally are medical doctors trained in the way the brain chemistry reacts and causes certain ailments such as depression, anxiety, OCD, etc.  They can help deal with your issues from a clinical point of view, diagnosing your issues in terms of chemical imbalances and how to help correct them to get you on a more normal level.  They can prescribe medication, because they have a medical degree and are usually a licensed doctor by whatever medical board is around.  There is, of course, overlap, and it is sometimes common to have a psychiatrist who also is a good psychologist.  However, I believe it is more often that they tend to refer you to each other.  Therapist is more of a blanket, colloquial term, without much in the way of strict classification.    The most important thing for anyone to realize about all of this is that it is perfectly OK to want help and to see someone.  I applaud you for taking the first step."

I called the police non emergency number and they directed me to call 911.  I called, made a report, a police officer came to my condo and followed up 20 minutes later. It all seemed very dramatic.   But about 2 weeks later I got a card in the mail with a thank you card from the car owner saying that my report allowed him to file a claim with his insurance and saved him a ton of money. He included a $75 gift card to Amazon. :)  Front bumper scratches aren't the same as a mirror being taken off, but it's still shitty.

boston,3dqwl1,HRP,-3,Sun Jul 19 15:25:47 2015 UTC,Why would you ever call insurance about a mirror taken off.
boston,3dqwl1,Rain12913,4,Sun Jul 19 13:00:06 2015 UTC,Uh...so you don't have to pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket?  I'm not sure you know what insurance means...
boston,3dqwl1,log-normal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:53:36 2015 UTC,"I would assume that most insurances have a deductible that's around what it costs to get a mirror fixed.  At that point you're weighing whether it's worth it to receive ($X - $Deductible) from the insurance company, vs. having a claim on your record that makes it more expensive to get insurance in the future.  For at-fault accidents specifically, MA insurance rates jump more than any other state's.    I can't find anything specific about MA and typical behavior for not-at-fault claims to your insurance - but if the damage is small, and there is no personal injury involved, I would first try to get it resolved with the person who damaged my car, if possible."

Obamacare premiums are sky rocketing in some states because people are racking up large expenses, which ultimately means the truly needy (people physically unable to work or suffering from severe psychological disorders) will be competing with people like the OP for resources.

If you live in Boston or one of its neighborhoods (e.g. Roxbury, Brookline), you can call the Mayor's Health Line where a state certified health Navigator can help you through the whole health insurance enrollment process: http://www.bphc.org/aboutus/mayors-health-line/Pages/MA-Health-Navigators.aspx  If you live outside of Boston, you can find an Enrollment Assister who serves your area here: https://betterhealthconnector.com/help-center  If you earn less than 300% of the federal poverty level ($35,310 for a family of 1), you should qualify for at least some financial help.  Massachusetts provides more comprehensive assistance than most of the rest of the country, but you might need to fill out extra paper work to qualify for all of it.  Get started on this ASAP (especially if you earn less than 300% of the FPL), because the process can be slow.

The modification I'd make to that tip is that you'll be better off going right to the source rather than relying on a social worker or the like.  Pop in to a MassHealth office (there's one in Tewksbury, one in Chelsea, one in Taunton, one in Boston, and a few others; check online for more/the exact locations), check in, take a number to speak to a worker, fill out the application, and talk to one of the workers there about any questions on your application you may have.  (This isn't a busy time of year, so you should be fine pretty much any time of day that they're open.)  Your TY 2014 federal tax return and/or a couple of recent pay stubs (bring both, just in case) will be required for income verification.  You should also bring along a recent utility bill for them to make a copy of to verify your address/Massachusetts residency.  If your job isn't a wage-paying job and you're a 1099 contract employee, you may need to include a profit & loss statement for your business if your most recent tax return isn't available or does not adequately describe your income.  This is the most direct way because you'll be speaking to and submitting your application directly to people who actually work at MassHealth instead of people who would just be submitting an application on your behalf.  If your annual income is under $15k-something and you are a household of one person, you are probably eligible for MassHealth Plus (MA's version of Medicaid).  If you have an injury, illness, or disability that prevents you from working, you may be eligible for regular old MassHealth (which requires a separate application).  Even if neither of these apply to you, however, you can still get set up on the connector and may be eligible for a subsidy depending upon your income.  If you can, I'd advise skipping the ""certified Navigators"" and dealing w/ MassHealth directly because a lot of times the Navigators they don't actually know the correct answer."

I work there and you will receive coverage and the medication you need; go in anytime 9-4 and go to patient financial services. Say you want to sign up for MassHealth.

Phoenix Landing in Cambridge is the Liverpool bar and it has a great atmosphere for most games and like 40 tvs. Decent, relatively cheap Irish/English fare as well."
boston,3dsjnu,snoodNwattle,7,Sun Jul 19 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"There's a few bars around here that are serious about European sport.  The Hit Wicket pub, near Inman Square, is strictly for watching the cricket.    You didn't mention which club you support, which is important in knowing where to go.  Arsenal:  Lir in Back Bay, on Boylston between Gloucester and Hereford.  Liverpool:  Phoenix Landing, Central Square, Cambridge  Chelsea:  The Banshee, Dot Ave, near JFK/UMass  Man U:  Crossroads in Back Bay, on Beacon between Hereford and Mass. Ave.  Spurs:  The Kinsale at Government Center  That's all I could find on a brief look (not being a supporter of the football, I didn't remember which pubs were which), but there are plenty of meetup groups and the like that are very dedicated to finding other expats and taking them under their wings.  I have not seen any hooliganism, but I've seen a lot of yelling over the years and the occasional scuffle, though friendly enough, mostly just taking the piss, really.  All of those bars, and for that matter, many others, are exquisite for watching World Cup matches, not that that will happen any time soon.  When I went to watch U.S. vs. Germany, not only was the Phoenix Landing full of good-natured supporters, they were teaching everyone else supporters' football chants.  I didn't even realize there were American football chants.  Accourse, I'm not sure I would have dared walk in for the U.S.-England match back in '10.  That would have been a bit much.  But yelling at the dirty Hun is a great occupation of Englishmen and wannabe Englishmen anyway.  If you want to watch AS Roma or Italian matches generally, go to Caffé dello Sport in the North End; my German-speaking daughter is out of town, and I'd have to ask her where her friends watch FC Bayern.  And absolutely every single Brazilian bar (most of which aren't in Boston or Cambridge proper) will be watching most of the matches that they can get from Brazil … but like Caffé dello Sport, the sports commentary will not be in English for obvious reasons.  You can get a full Irish breakfast and some exquisite fish and chips at The Druid in Inman Square, Cambridge, but I've really got no idea where to find a full English, unfortunately.  British goodies are sold at Cardullo's in Cambridge (Harvard Square), some are sold at Formaggio Kitchen (a half-mile outside Harvard Square, another location in the South End), a number can be found in the Irish-owned shops in in Quincy.  Fellow Brits?  You might want to consider some meetup groups.  The Brits have a consulate in Cambridge near Kendall Square and an international school in Jamaica Plain to teach the children of Brits and colonials alike the material needed to take their GCSEs and A-Levels and grow up and re-establish Her Majesty's Empire.  There are plenty of Brit expats around here, not just various ones who married Americans, but actual social circles of the English, I'm just not given a lot of entrée into them because my circle is tech geeks orbiting between Boston and Berkeley."

boston,3dui4m,riski_click,12,Sun Jul 19 18:04:46 2015 UTC,so it makes sense that an entire apartment in Boston would cost less than that.

Cheapest possible is probably going Dorchester (some parts) And Roxbury in the city. If you don't mind a bit of a commute, Chelsea is a good spot and even Salem (25ish minute ride on commuter rail into north station) could work.  While I've heard tales of mythical 1k studios in boston, I'd budget at least $1200, probably more. Good luck!"

There are tryouts, a draft (or you could start your own team), and actual playoffs.  Stinkysocks is more akin to an organized pickup with a ref.  They have leagues that supposedly have more than two teams, but every time I've signed up for one, there weren't enough skaters and it was knocked down to a two team weekly pickup.  The other good thing about stinkysocks is that you can just drop in on a game if there's availability on their website."

I have attended both Suffolk and Bentley and I can attest to the jump that occurred in not only difficulty but recognition of their business school. I have already secured an internship at a top public accounting firm and will most likely end up working there after I finish my grad year. I have no idea how your comment got so highly upvoted due to how wrong it is.  Now for OP: I have to say, since I'm an ISAC (Info Sys and Accounting put together, basically) major, I can't really help you with how much of a jump Bentley will give you. Are you open to changing your major to possibly include Accounting? Our Corporate Finance and Accounting major gets a lot of attention from what I've heard.   However, when it comes to just pure finance, I believe a lot of it is what you know. If you can attend any stock competitions or possibly get involved in any clubs (or are involved in any) at Suffolk, I believe your best bet would be to stay at Suffolk. Are you absolutely positive that you wouldn't be willing to live off campus? I transferred from Suffolk after my freshman year and, while it was hard, I got to meet a couple of good friends. Maybe give Greek life a try if you do change and can live off campus? No matter what, if you do transfer, prepare to work a -LOT- harder."
boston,3dsd2z,Nasiso,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:57:51 2015 UTC,Bentley is definitely not bottom tier. And it is more than an extremely marginal step up from Suffolk.  What makes you say otherwise? Did you have a bad experience there or something?

If you work your ass off there and make good connections, you will land a good job, but, again, you have to WORK for it, but it is possible. Bentley is near the top for accounting and Babson is supposed to be fantastic for entrepreneurship."

boston,3dt5mz,BedtimeforBonzos,6,Mon Jul 20 13:29:38 2015 UTC,"Some of this others have said but my list would be:   Waterproof boots (nothing more miserable than waiting for a late train with icy, sodden feet, and the train is always late when your feet are like that). Good coat, preferably on the longish side covering your butt (butt has lots of surface area and lots of heat loss.) Dress in layers to hold in heat. Hat to cover your ears. Scarf to cover your throat (even if you have a good coat.) The heat loss from your throat is amazing. Warm gloves or mittens. An absolute necessity.   Believe it or not you can even dress fashionably using these guidelines. If you are dressed for the weather, it's nothing, it's actually fun.  Embrace the winter, now that you are dressed properly. Go out in the snowstorm. It's really cool. Look into winter sports like ice skating or skiing. I have friends from Miami - Cubans - who headed north the first time they came to NE and learned to ski. Now they come every year and are way better at it than me."

I'm nowhere near the boldest of men when it comes to winter - but if I add that in addition to long underwear bottoms and tops (note - these can be found cheaper at Marshall's or something), then layer on my regular work clothes, boots, jacket, the balaclava, hat, and gloves, I feel impervious to the weather.    Layering down at work is a different story, and might take a few minutes.  Unless your office is ""environmentally friendly"" which means they ""don't turn on the heat"", like mine, so I keep the long underwear on all day.  Note:  The ice is the trickiest part.

Read if you plan on driving a car in the fall/early winter.  The leaves are very pretty but very dangerous too. They are extremely slippery when wet and cause many accidents where people think they can stop quickly but their tires are on a patch of wet leaves so they skid.   Also, they will fall off the ground and into gutters. This will block water from going down the gutters and create standing water which will turn into ice, which is another very unsafe driving situation if you need to stop quickly."

boston,3dt5mz,voltige73,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"No one uses tire chains. Snow tires will be fine.  Many people, especially people who have the option of staying home on the few days (in a normal year, not last year) when it's really bad, even get by on good all seasons. If you aren't used to driving in snow, I'd strongly recommend the snow tires, they absolutely do give you much more of a safety margin."
boston,3dt5mz,fairytailgod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:06:09 2015 UTC,If there's enough snow on the roads to justify chains you shouldn't be driving on them.
boston,3dt5mz,cosinezero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:52 2015 UTC,Just moved here from the south and nervously awaiting our first real winter. We have an AWD vehicle (sold both of our compact cars and got one subaru) with all-season tires. Is it a necessity for us to buy snow tires? Is having chains enough?
boston,3dt5mz,Mitch_from_Boston,2,Sun Jul 19 15:33:21 2015 UTC,"Snow tires are standard between December and March. Chains are only for extreme situations - they do happen, but you can't drive on chains for very long. You'll see.  The thing about Boston is the temperature changes a lot, above and below freezing every day, so you get a lot of ice, wet ice, and potholes. Take it easy, leave enough distance, don't let them force you to take risks. Boston drivers are not famous for safety."
boston,3dt5mz,ActiveSite,2,Sun Jul 19 15:45:50 2015 UTC,"Lots of people go without snow tires, myself included. However, I've lived here my whole life and have lots of experience with driving in all kinds of snowy conditions. Since you are not experienced driving in snow I would go for the snow tires. Driving and dealing with snow really is a skill, and a learning process."
boston,3dt5mz,Otterfan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:49:11 2015 UTC,"Subarus are great in the snow. Snow tires aren't absolutely necessary. But if you have the money, buying a set - specifically for ice performance - isn't a bad idea. And it'll save wear & tear on your all-season tires, too."

Trust me, we get just as cold as you will, but we know that once we step inside the house, or let the car warm up, we'll be warm and comfortable again.    Buy a long jacket...but please...please don't wear it until it is at minimum 20 degrees out.

boston,3dn7mr,B0pp0,21,Fri Jul 17 17:16:15 2015 UTC,I just spent a couple of days in Chicago and the laws there are so much more relaxed about drinking. I was amazed bars can serve till 4/5am and stores can sell liquor till 2am. While in Massachusetts we are stuck with laws and cut offs that act like nagging parents
boston,3dn7mr,lazywiteboy,3,Fri Jul 17 19:23:10 2015 UTC,Mass is just way different than the rest of the country.  I grew up in a state near Illinois where you could find dollar beer days often and even a $10 all you can drink (college town).  I honestly thought people were messing with me when they said happy hour is illegal in Mass.  I didn't understand how they could do it or enforce it

boston,3dn7mr,yepmek,3,Fri Jul 17 18:03:07 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Bars in the Boston area must love the happy hour ban but why aren't people from smaller towns and cities not saying anything? It doesn't make sense.

boston,3dn7mr,yepmek,5,Sat Jul 18 03:08:19 2015 UTC,"I recently moved to Mass from Chicago and now I work at a bar downtown Boston. Drinking is so much more chill in the Midwest it's crazy. Even though we didn't have happy hour in Chicago, our bars had so many daily specials, unregulated by actual hours (like $5 long islands on Wednesdays, 50 cent beers on Tuesdsays, etc) that it never really felt like we lacked much of a happy hour. But in MA you can get written up for mentioning the phrase ""drink special."""
boston,3dn7mr,TeamLittleFinger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:22:45 2015 UTC,Ahh a fellow mid-westerner. You're totally right. In college (and beyond) happy hour completely dictated my weekly drinking schedule with friends. Every bar had a different amazing deal on every day of the week. It was so much more fun!
boston,3dn7mr,TeamLittleFinger,-7,Sun Jul 19 16:31:18 2015 UTC,Why did you move? Outside the shootings Chicago is a much better place. It's why the Red Sox are merely a pipeline to the Cubs.  I'd bolt for Evanston or Skokie or Oak Park in a heartbeat if I could.
boston,3dn7mr,Mitch_from_Boston,5,Sat Jul 18 02:35:39 2015 UTC,"I moved for the same reason most people move to Boston - grad school. Chicago is awesome, I lived on the North side my whole life so I never experienced much crime at all. Unfortunately/fortunately it is pretty much all condensed on the south side.

boston,3dn7mr,froyololol,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:14:20 2015 UTC,"There's a reason Buffalo housing is so cheap. It's because there's no jobs, no real downtown (the entire city is a giant suburb), far more crime, and the worst winters in the continental US. They got 7 feet of snow in two days last year...  Oh yeah, and it's in NY, a state that makes MA look downright libertarian."

boston,3dn7mr,essonse,10,Sat Jul 18 22:36:11 2015 UTC,"The law's shepherd, state Rep. Sara Feigenholtz (D), successfully argued the happy hour ban was hurting Chicago's economy, which increasingly relies on food tourism.   Can't say I know much about Chicago's bar scene, but I do know Boston's somewhat, and if we're going off this as an argument for why Boston needs happy hour, I don't think you'll find many supporters.  Boston has such a large amount of 20-somethings as well as such a large tourism base, that you go to almost any bar at ~6pm on a summer afternoon and it is slammed.  While happy hour will certainly benefit bar patrons, I don't think there will be many restaurants/bars viewing it as a means of spurring economic activity.  If anything, they'll just be losing revenue, and thus will be more likely to oppose it."
boston,3dn7mr,bakgwailo,28,Fri Jul 17 18:12:27 2015 UTC,..This law isn't for Boston.  It's for the whole of Massachusetts - which includes ~4.5 million people living outside of the 128 all the way toward the New York border.   That's A LOT of small towns and post-industrial cities that struggle with tourism and getting people in the door. Its places like Pittsfield or Chicopee that are hurting.
boston,3dn7mr,bakgwailo,4,Fri Jul 17 20:38:25 2015 UTC,I've lived in both cities and I can assure you that Chicago bars are the same. Although Chicago is significantly larger than Boston the areas that most 20-30 year olds go to drink is similar in size/demographics to Boston.
boston,3dn7mr,bakgwailo,2,Fri Jul 17 18:25:40 2015 UTC,"You could say the exact same things about Boston and have it apply to NYC, DC, the major California cities, even Chicago. Granted in the first two the number of people using transit as a DD is about 99% Boston isn't much different.  Also, consider that this would be an entire state thing. Changing the rules for Chicago also benefits the rest of the state from a chain restaurant in Kankakee to a college bar in Champaign to a dive in Quincy or Harrisburg. Just like if a repeal happened here it would be the Salisburys and Hyannises and Springfields and Great Barringtons going for it. The fact that to some people the state ends when the MBTA does is mypopic."

Draw - how some people (usually the north shore accent) pronounce drawer.  Heated - mad, bullshit, fuming, angry.  Ham - a delicious meat often prepared for holiday dinners.  All Set - good, don't need anything. Depending on the context, it can be a polite way to say stop bothering me.  All Set - I don't need change back. Whatever cash is in excess to what's owed is gratuity.   Wicked - an adverb and intensifier, and NEVER a noun. The new dunks breakfast sandwiches are actually wicked good  Dip(ped)- To slip away undetected.  On my ass - This one can mean a few different things, depending on who or what is on your ass.   Literally, refers to someone tailgating you. That statie was on my ass Figuratively, it means someone won't leave you alone, probably because they need something from you. eg Bob is on my ass for those TPS reports. Might have to dip outta here and pretend my cat's at home sick so I don't have to deal with that fucker Can also mean put you on your ass (figuratively or literally). Careful with the mai tais at hong kong. One minute I was having a great time and the next minute I was on my ass   Carriage - shopping cart  Fucker - asshole  Snake - can mean as a verb to slyly swoop in and take something. eg. I was waiting patiently at south shore plaza and this fucker came in and snaked my parking spot  Slip - a space on a dock where you keep your boat. Usually rented and assigned."

Until that time, the system we have established and to which we have ceded power will not simply summarily execute (or allow to be executed) a person accused of a crime.  When it is somebody notorious who stands accused, if the State does not ensure that individual survives the legal process then the entire concept of justice is sabotaged. This was money well-spent and a minuscule fraction of the total police budget."
boston,3dmao7,Anxa,10,Fri Jul 17 19:36:01 2015 UTC,"Well said. Except he was willing to plea to life without parole, which would have saved all this and much more money. Millions were spent out of desire to kill him. The trial wasn't necessary if the prosecutor hadn't tried for the death penalty."
boston,3dmao7,blizzardalert,4,Fri Jul 17 18:05:00 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but it was the prosecutor's desire to push for the death penalty - something that was eminently permissible under the current law.   This is the thing about the law - whether you or I agree with the death penalty, the reality is that it is currently a part of our legal framework. If I were the prosecutor, I would likely see it as my obligation to enforce the law as it exists, not as I wish it to be. And under existing federal law, I absolutely believe his crimes qualified for the death sentence, regardless of how I feel about that particular law."

And under existing federal law, I absolutely believe his crimes qualified for the death sentence, regardless of how I feel about that particular law.   Probably the most important word about prosecutors (and really the entire justice system) is discretion.  There is no obligation on the part of police officers or prosecutors to enforce the law.  Ever been given ""just a warning""? That was a cop using his discretion.  Prosecutors decide what to charge people with and what plea bargains to offer at their discretion.  No prosecutor believes it's ""[his] obligation to enforce the law as it exists"" because there are enough nuances in the law to achieve practically any desired outcome."
boston,3dmao7,Coomb,2,Fri Jul 17 19:39:44 2015 UTC,"The law as it exists allows for discretion, I apologize if my meaning was interpreted too broadly - you're obviously correct that discretion is built into the justice system. However it is also entirely within a prosecutor's discretion to press for the death sentence if they believe the crime was sufficiently severe. I said 'qualify', but I should have specified 'deserve'."

That's why plea deals exist.

boston,3dmao7,therealrico,16,Fri Jul 17 19:37:34 2015 UTC,The construction company typically pays this.
boston,3dmao7,Borsaid,5,Fri Jul 17 16:31:46 2015 UTC,"Wasn't aware of that.  With that being said should it really be required for construction zones all to have a police detail?  Will a flagger suffice?  And what about projects like road paving?  The construction company might pay for the cop, but they count that into what they charge to do the job, which would be footed by the taxpayers, right?"
boston,3dmao7,therealrico,2,Fri Jul 17 19:11:27 2015 UTC,Flag man cost almost the same as a detail.  The details are figured into the cost that the construction company bids the town/city to work the job. The town/city also takes a cut of the detail money made by the cop and then takes more out during the income tax.
boston,3dmao7,Typelouderplz,7,Fri Jul 17 19:18:26 2015 UTC,Really?  That makes no sense that a flag detail costs the same as a police detail.
boston,3dmao7,therealrico,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:36:24 2015 UTC,Lots of hidden costs. Plus you get what you pay for.  I've been on a detail and because things were so hectic I've been dispatched from my detail to render emergency services.    Detail rates are negotiated by departments and cities and different through out the state.  Boston has a low detail rate compared to other places.
boston,3dmao7,Typelouderplz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:46:20 2015 UTC,"I've been dispatched from my detail to render emergency services.   This is the most common argument in favor of police traffic details but I see it as supporting flaggers. As a business, if I am required to have somebody directing traffic around my project I want them to direct traffic around my project. Not leave the site where they are supposed to be working in order to provide emergency services for somebody else and leave my hanging. I don't mean this in a cruel way, I mean that if an emergency happens 911 should be called and hopefully paramedics and police will respond quickly. The fact that you were on detail near an emergency situation is a crapshoot. What if an emergency happened in area you would normally be patrolling if you weren't on detail work somewhere else?  My mother's company was looking to get a security guard and there was a group of people who argued in favor of getting a paid detail because they would be safer under the watch of a police officer. The company ended up going with a private security company instead because if there was a nearby emergency, the private security guard would continue to monitor their property whereas the police officer would leave and tend to the emergency."

For my job I have paid bills for both hired labor and police details. Police details are $45/hr. That's insanity and a cost we have to pass on to our client. Our hired labor gets $10/hr for unskilled manual labor. There are a lot of citizens who can't find work who would appreciate a part time gig doing traffic control for $20/hr. Surely we should be helping these people out and letting police patrol their neighborhoods and keep us safe. Police should make their money through taxes and protect the citizens of their district. Paid details are a privately-funded bonus for highly overqualified policemen."

Details are a way to supplement the overall contract of police departments with the town you are working in, by allowing you to Dig in the publicy funded roadways/public areas you are agreeing to use police details, which the towns use as a negotiating chip in Police contract negotiations, as a way of keeping salaries down.   If you are talking about Government jobs, then the cost comes out of the bid that you already put forth. It doesn't cost the Government any extra. infact they get money back by taking the cut of the Taxes and just a flat portion of the detail for my services.

boston,3dro1s,_insidesource_,14,Sat Jul 18 20:18:16 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Chelsea for over a year now (right off Broadway, about a quarter mile from Bellingham Sq.) and honestly I think these comments are a bit over exaggerated.  Yes the area is a majority middle-low to low income housing, but that doesn't make it a bad place to live.  I tend to frequently walk around town and visit the local shops and markets.  I have yet to run into anyone that is avoiding me because I don't speak Spanish or look like I'm from South America.  All you need to do is be friendly towards other people and show them some respect.  A friendly smile transcends any language barrier.  The crime is more prevalent here than in some areas of Boston, but it's not like there are gangs of armed villains running rampant through the town (day or night).  There is an active police presence throughout the city and this is one of the few towns where I have actually been able to run into members of the police, fire and paramedics at a local shop or out in town and have an honest conversation with them.  The police even have monthly meetings at the local coffee shops, where anyone can come and share their concerns with them.  The transportation is a bit of an issue, depending on where you need to commute to.  There are four main ways to cross into Boston.  The Tobin, Sumner Tunnel, the Pike tunnel and the 99.  If you drive, the traffic can be bothersome during rush hour, but that usually is only around the Tobin/93 interchange (on Tobin), the tunnel (on Sumner), or after you cross the bridge and enter Somerville (on 99).  I can't speak for the Pike tunnel as I don't really ever use it ($3.00 toll hurts).  And on the topic of tolls if you are a resident of Chelsea, you get a discount on the Tobin toll, I only pay $.30 to cross.  Usually the traffic clears up hours before the main routes to other communities does (93, 90 etc).  And even if it is bad, the exits for Chelsea are so close that it doesn't take long to get off the highway.  It's nice being able to go 55mph up the 1 at 5:30pm when you see everyone else stuck in gridlock on 93/90.  If you rely on public transportation, the buses are generally packed during the typical commute times.  But they are aware of this and are currently constructing a Silver Line Expansion that will give the area another route into Boston.  The thing I like about this area's transportation is there are plenty of options.  Just in my area alone I have the choice of using one of four (soon to be five) buses which connect with either Haymarket (green, orange line) or Maverick (blue line).  And there is also the commuter rail within walking distance of Bellingham Sq.  Even during the last winter I was still able to mostly keep my normal commute times by paying attention to where the delays were and choosing my options carefully (Chelsea to MFA in about 1hour).  This area is a little rough around the edges, and it really depends how much effort you want to put into living here.  Any place you move to will have it's pros and cons.  Hopefully this gives you a better insight into the Chelsea area.  edit: Forgot about the pike tunnel and tolls."

I have never felt unsafe at any time while living here. No one has ever been unkind to me or harassed me. I've definitely never been murdered either.  Is Chelsea less safe than other places? Probably. But it depends on what you're used to. The worst I've experienced is some mild cat-calling. There are places that you'll come to know to avoid, but if you happen to find yourself walking through one of those places at 1 am, more likely than not, you'll be just fine. There are great things about Chelsea: proximity to the city, ease of travel (whether by car or T), and lots of shopping nearby in Everett or Assembly Row. Let me be honest though. If you're moving to Chelsea, it's not because you're interested in spending a ton of time in Chelsea. If you're like me, you're moving here because it's affordable and close. But murdery? Nah."

boston,3dn0pj,GorillaEstefan,24,Fri Jul 17 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"Boston doesn't really have an exclusive dish, per say. I would say the closest thing to that has to be our seafood. Things like steamers (steamed clams), fried clams/scollops, fish and chips, lobster rolls, and cooked full lobsters are the closest things to exclusive.  There is some great Italian food in the Northend and some really great bakeries. Don't bother going to any of the pastry shops that have a huge line, go to Bova Bakery instead. I like their stuff the best and the line is always reasonable. I also think the original Regina Pizzaria in the Northend is god damn amazing. If I was away from Boston for a couple years it would be one of the first places I visited. It's been open since 1926 and their brick oven is a magic.  There are a good amount of decent breweries around Boston. I like Harpoon, Slumbrew, Trillium, and Jacks Abby. You can also visit all of those breweries. For a great selection of Belgian and American beer head over to The Publick House in Brookline. They have a great selection of beer and their food is fantastic. Get the mac and cheese, it's insanely good."
boston,3dn0pj,kabob23,21,Fri Jul 17 16:43:33 2015 UTC,"Things like steamers (steamed clams), fried clams/scollops, fish and chips, lobster rolls, and cooked full lobsters are the closest things to exclusive.   Seconded.  Everyone says ""seafood,"" but the only stuff that's truly regional these days are soft shell clams (served both steamed as ""steamers"" and fried as ""whole belly clams""), lobster, raw local oysters (notably Wellfleet and Island Creek), jonah crabs, and perhaps some not-as-marketable fish like porgy, tautog, black sea bass, and bluefish.  If you're staying with your brother-in-law, consider bringing home some lobsters to eat.  Most grocery stores will even cook them for you, so you can eat like a king for the $7-10/lb that they charge for them.  Also track down a $1 oyster happy hour if you've never had non-gulf oysters (e.g. Rialto on Mondays).    On the north shore of Boston, the roast beef sandwich is a regional favorite. Roast Beast in Allston and Scampo in Cambridge offer decent versions.  IMHO the North End has been superseded by the plethora of true regional Italian restaurant that have sprouted up in the last 20 years in the US.  It's still a neat place, and there are some places that serve very good food, but the focus decidedly Italian-American.  Places like Pizzeria Regina, Galleria Umberto, Modern/Maria's/Bova, and maybe a Caffe Vittoria are the types of places to hit.  For beer, Cambridge Brewing Company brewpub in Kendall Sq is truly excellent, particularly if you focus on the Belgian and barrel aged, and malt-forward styles. I find their hoppy beers to be frequently underwhelming, with a few notable exceptions.  If you want hoppy, look for beers from Trillium (essentially available only on tap at bars or to-go from the brewery).  The NE beer scene is great, so this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Near Harvard Sq, Cambridge Common usually has a good selection of NE taps for reasonable prices.  Regarding ethnic cuisines, Boston is reasonably strong in Vietnamese, Portuguese, Brazilian, Cambodian (try Thmor Da in Revere, assuming a trip to Lowell isn't in the cards),  Thai, and Sichuan Chinese.  Nonperishable food...You could pick up something like maple syrup or apple butter, but it's not like availability is limited to NE."
boston,3dn0pj,emannths,5,Fri Jul 17 17:32:31 2015 UTC,Glad you mentioned Roast Beast. I looked it up after reading this and I'm going to be living a half mile from it next year. This could get dangerous.
boston,3dn0pj,lussierc,3,Fri Jul 17 20:14:52 2015 UTC,The common link between many of the roast beef places around is using James River brand bbq sauce. It is possible to find it sold in some beef shops or ordered online. What is hard to replicate is the super thin medium rare beef that the good locations hand slice to order.

Modern refrigeration/transit techniques means even Austin can have top-of-the-line fresh Lobster.. albeit, expensive.   Still, let's mark a few things off your list:            Johnnycakes are pretty exclusive to New England. Go to the Deluxe Town Diner in Watertown for some!  Parker House Rolls. Get 'em at the Parker House!  Fresh oysters. I'd recommend checking out The Red House in Cambridge anytime before 6PM. You can get 2 for $1.                     New England Clam Chowder. Get it anywhere. I also really really like Rhode Island Clam Chowder - but that's harder to find (it's broth based, not creme based).   Lobster Rolls - really common - even sold at McDonald's now. But they tend to be overpriced here in Boston. Eaten cold traditionally, sometimes hot.   Boston Creme Pie. I prefer a good Boston Creme Donut to the Pie, especially from Kane's (financial district). Worth the trek - be weary of early closing hours.  Whoopie Pies. I've rarely seen them when I lived in New York - but they're everywhere here. Ever corner store and gas station sells 'em.   Stop by the North End for a cannoli at either Mike's or Modern Pastry.   Hard Cider is pretty popular here in New England comparatively. Try a Downeast.  More of a Upstate New York/Vermont thing - but Cheddar Cheese and Maple Syrup are staples here. Bring a bottle of the 'good shit' back with you.  Buy a bottle of Bully Boy Whiskey, made right here in Boston. It's smoother and tastier than most of what you'll find in Kentucky.  People here go wild for ice cream. I recommend Emack and Bolio's.   Beer: Sam Adams and Harpoon are the 'big ones' here. Harpoon is arguably better. Ton of microbrews too. Like beer? Go to Sunset Grill and Tap in Allston. Large, yet divey - and has ~110 Beers on tap. Publick House is also excellent, but more expensive. Also check out Lord Hobo in Cambridge - one of my favorite craft beer bars.   The North End boasts probably the best Italian cuisine in the country. And I say that as a former New Yorker. Seriously. Eat anywhere there and be satisfied - I'm a fan of Giacomo's (be aware: cash only [most places are in North End], no reservations, could be a long wait [45min+] for a table.. worth it). Pizza, however... I'll keep my mouth shut on that.   Have fun, dude."

boston,3dn0pj,mezzrricki,7,Fri Jul 17 17:39:33 2015 UTC,Armsby Abbey   It's worth it if you're seeking out Hill Farmstead. Otherwise Lord Hobo  is probably the better bet once you factor in the difference in distance.

Mead Hall in Kendall or Sunset in Allston should offer a wide variety of local stuff, so you could have some tasting flights. I was pregnant when I went to Austin so I sadly can't compare.   Random foods to try - get a lobster roll, I recommend with butter over mayo. There was a thread about this a while ago but on mobile, can't search easily. I'm from north so random favs my southern family hunt down when visiting are whoopie pies, cream horns, any fresh seafood, blueberry anything (they're in perfect season right now).   Also if you hit up Sunset you could get a grilled fluffernutter with banana which is amazing (or you could omit the banana). I love it with a side of BBC Coffeehouse Porter.

I recommend trying it even if you're not usually a big cider fan. It's hearty and opaque like real apple cider, not clear and fizzy like Angry Orchard.  TL;DR: Get a plate of fried clams, some steamers, and a whole steamed lobster (not all at once). Clam chowder for an appetizer. Wash it all down with Downeast Cider. Enjoy!"

Mystic is great for saison style beers, Nightshift has awesome sours and great hoppy stuff, Cambridge Brewing Company is just really well-rounded, etc. For what it's worth, I think Treehouse is the best in the whole state, but that's not so feasible for a Boston visitor...  Trillium's non-hoppy offerings are also really, really good. The two varieties of coffee stout they did were terrific, they've done some great sours, and I love Sinister Kid, their Belgian Strong Ale.

You might want to skip lunch if you go here - it's a lot of food.  There aren't very many places in the US serving Jiro - it's a recent style of ramen.  The owner of Yume was apprenticed at a ramen-ya run by a student of the guy who invented Jiro.

Did the passed out kid offer up any real threat? Does it matter? Probably not. You don't need to be a credible threat to get charged with assault.   To give an example, a group of friends of mine got into an altercation with a cop. Someone muttered ""asshole"" under their breath while walking away from cops that had closed off a road when they were being jerks about it. A cop came running after the group yelling and swearing about how you can't disrespect cops. One of the girls in the group was drunk and stupid and so started yelling back at them. So the asshole cop and stupid girl are screaming a each other over nothing, and my very chill and sober friend cane over, but his hands gently on both of their shoulders and said basically, ""it is cool guys, there is no reason to be freaking out, let's just go our separate ways"".

Use an image editing program to crop and scale the image so the resolution exactly equals the combined height/width of your monitors.  i.e. if you have two 1920x1080 monitors, you want your image to be 3840x1080.

Allston, Somerville, Malden or Dorchester might be good options for you."
boston,3dr9yl,PaulyCT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"Given your budget, you'd be fine looking in Cambridge. A 2-3 bedroom anywhere between Davis and Kendall should probably be within the 2-3k range. You have plenty to work with. Alternatively, you could likely find yourself along the south shore on the red line. I don't know much about rents down there, but I imagine you'd easily find something within your range for a decent commute.  Honestly, that's a high enough budget to look really anywhere within the city. You could likely live in the North End and have a nice walk to work, or maybe in Southie and have a nice walk/maybe a bus ride to work. Either way, you have plenty of options at that price range.

They don't make less an hour they work less due to child care and pregnancy. Also generally work in lower paying fields such as mental health and teachers.   The rest of the bill just reiterates Federal Law. The part about trying to hide wages is good though.  What needs to be added is a long payed maternity and paternity leave. Also some child care incentive, maybe a tax break for providing daycare."

boston,3dqibe,mgzukowski,-5,Sat Jul 18 15:41:01 2015 UTC,"While I think the factors you listed definitely play into the gender wage gap, I think it minimizes the issue to say they are the only reasons. Even in the same field with the same education, women are offered less than men. Additionally, working less due to childcare and pregnancy only accounts for 10% of the gap.  I do think even if some don't agree with the gender wage gap part of the bill, there are definitely parts people can relate to, like the hiding wages. Also, wouldn't it be nice if all job postings listed the salary right off the bat?"

Bleu is something that me and my now husband bonded over while beginning dating in high school in philly and he is honestly one of the reasons I went to college in /moved to boston. But right after we graduated he moved to L.A. so we don't see him in concert often and it really just sucks we are missing this.  Again I'd be willing to pay even extra for the ticket and switch places with the person after Bleu performs and he is performing first so I figured maybe someone who doesn't have an interest in Bleu would be willing to help out a die hard fan

boston,3do2rt,Maschinenwesen,10,Fri Jul 17 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"It is an acceptable form of ID under MA law, but some people don't know the law very well and/or are just jerks. Probably won't be a problem at most places though.   What forms of identification are acceptable to prove that someone is twenty one years of age or older, so that person may be served, delivered, or allowed to possess or purchase alcoholic beverages? If a licensee is charged with permitting the service, delivery, or possession of alcoholic beverages by a person under twenty one years of age, under current state law, a licensee has a defense only if the licensee can affirmatively prove that prior to permitting the service, delivery or possession of alcoholic beverages by a person, the licensee requested, was shown, examined and reasonably relied on either: A Massachusetts Driver’s License; A Massachusetts Liquor Identification Card; A Massachusetts Identification Card; A Passport Issued by the United States or a government that is officially recognized by the United States; A Passport Card for a Passport issued by the United States; and A Military Identification Card. Reliance by a licensee on any other form of identification to determine proof of age does not give the licensee a defense. As of December 1, 2012, neither the state Liquor Control Act nor the regulations of the ABCC require identification to be checked as a condition to selling or delivering an alcoholic beverage to any person (except in the case of certain deliveries to consumers at their homes or offices). Each licensee is left to decide for itself what policy to establish on checking identification prior accepting orders for, selling and delivering alcoholic beverages. Some licensees adopt a conservative policy, as they may legally do under the Liquor Control Act and the ABCC regulations, and require proof of age from any person who appears to be younger than thirty years of age and accept as proof of age only the six pieces of identification that give a licensee a defense to any criminal conviction, civil liability and/or administrative prosecution. Therefore, while a licensee may choose to rely upon any form of identification to obtain proof of age, only these specific six forms of identification provide a defense to a charge of service, delivery, or possession of alcoholic beverages by a person under twenty-one years of age."

boston,3di2c3,truckstoptony,7,Thu Jul 16 21:21:08 2015 UTC,"This is a bit different.  Back in 2005 people were buying houses they couldn't afford - and they were overbidding on houses way out in the exurbs that came with 2hr commutes (very similar to what happened in Japan in the late 80s).  Now prices are blowing up primarily in the urban core and the more walkable/close-in communities, there are cash offers (meaning, no defaults), and we still have people out near 495 who are underwater.  There's also been a huge shift in commercial real estate over the past decade - the center of energy has moved downtown (Kendall, DTX, seaport, etc...) - vacancy rates are at historic lows even though the amount of commercial space has increased, and businesses in these areas are looking to expand.  the 128 corridor is doing OK, but it's become second-class commercial space and everyone is trying to reposition themselves as ""transit orientated, walkable, mixed use"" to compete with the more desirable urban market where everyone really wants to be.  living preference has definitely changed (for various reasons - but it's important to note that the top aspirational lifestyle has definitely shifted more urban), and there's an increasing premium on places where you can live your daily life without a car - or at least minimize your time in a car.  If you remember the 2005 bubble, you'd also remember that some markets never popped - for example, East Cambridge seemed completely immune - with prices rising even in 2009."

What will basically happen is that anyone not making a certain salary will be forced out, except for subsidized housing for the poor (and public housing).

That does not seem right and is counter to what I've heard from numerous people currently giving me advice how to buy a house.   Edit: thank you all for answering in detail instead of downvoting me into oblivion
boston,3di2c3,hobo_law,24,Thu Jul 16 15:55:20 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, It's typically 5% to 20%, but if you put down less than 20% you'll also need to pay for mortgage insurance, and you'll end up paying more per month, and more overall in interest.  Massachusetts  does have first time home buyer assistance programs which I believe allow you put down less, but I really don't know too much about them."
boston,3di2c3,godshammgod15,9,Thu Jul 16 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"You have to take a first-time homebuyer class to qualify. The no PMI loans at 5% down are usually at a higher interest rate. When we looked into it, they were about 5%.   EDIT: We ended up just getting a traditional mortgage and put more down. We got an interest rate of 3.25%, which turned out to be a pretty substantial savings. I honestly wouldn't advise people to put down 5%, because it puts you in a very dangerous position where you can easily find yourself underwater. More money down=more initial equity. Add to that all the extraneous costs of buying a house, and it can become very tight, very quickly. In our case our monthly mortgage payment/interest/taxes/insurance only ended up being about $150 more than our rent payment, so it was a no-brainer."
boston,3di2c3,cfpyfp,14,Thu Jul 16 16:20:04 2015 UTC,"The market in Boston is pretty hot right now, there are a lot of buyers and sellers are getting multiple offers before they are even doing open houses. PMI aside, put down less than 20% and you won't be taken very seriously since there will almost certainly be someone putting more down."
boston,3di2c3,dtmfadvice,7,Thu Jul 16 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"Can confirm: The more you put down, the more likely the transaction will go through. Which means that the more you put down, the more attractive your offer is. If someone gets two offers at $X, where one is putting down 10% and one is putting down 20%... they're going to accept the 20% down buyer.  What really seals the deal is having the whole amount in cash, no mortgage at all. One-percenters win every time."
boston,3di2c3,fps81,3,Thu Jul 16 16:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yep - I put an offer on a house last year with 20% down - was rejected by the seller in favor of a slightly lower offer with no mortgage.   (this was a $800K house)  When you're selling a house and you accept an offer, the buyer has a month or so to get their finances together to prove they can pay for the house. For that whole period, your house is still not sold, but you have to basically take it off the market and reject other offers.   A lot of people bringing less than 20% to the table can't pull together the funds and have to back out of the purchase."
boston,3di2c3,rewlor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"You don't have to reject subsequent offers.  I recently sold my house, had two back ups.  Offer was over asking, and we were worried appraisal wouldn't go our way.  Agent stopped showing it when the appraisal came in just above contract on the initial offer.  As long as everyone knows a back up is a back up, there's nothing wrong with it."
boston,3di2c3,what_comes_after_q,5,Thu Jul 16 22:29:35 2015 UTC,"20% down is required to avoid private mortgage insurance (PMI). In short, if you don't put hardly any money down on a house, the bank thinks you're a higher risk than someone who puts 20% down (if you default on payment, you lose that equity), so they charge more to make up for it. It's actually a good rule of thumb, if you can't afford 20% down, chances are you can't afford to own a house. What will you do if the boiler goes? What if your roof starts to leak? If you can't scrounge up 20%, you probably can't scrounge up maintenance costs and you'll get in over your head."

What will you do if the boiler goes? What if your roof starts to leak? If you can't scrounge up 20%, you probably can't scrounge up maintenance costs and you'll get in over your head.    It makes sense in some markets more than others.  Home price is a product of demand for the location (or other related thing) and building costs, whereas maintenance costs is really just a product of building costs.  Identical houses built in San Francisco and Wichita are going to have pretty similar maintenance costs.  The average cost of a house in SF is a little over 1m, but the average cost in Wichita is only ~100k, so it seems likely that the home in SF would go for ~10x more.  Someone in SF with a 70k down payment available might more likely to be able to afford maintenance costs than someone in Wichita with only 20k, but this metric wouldn't show that."
boston,3di2c3,bjam2,2,Thu Jul 16 17:04:00 2015 UTC,"Maintenance costs will definitely be more expensive both for labor and materials. Most likely not proportional though.  You are also forgetting about property taxes, insurance, utilities, and everything else.  The real reason you need 20% down is so that if the value of the house drops you won't become underwater on the house. This is literally what happened in the housing crash, as long as value goes up your fine even with ARM's  but the minute it drops or even just stops appreciating...."
boston,3di2c3,what_comes_after_q,2,Thu Jul 16 17:28:41 2015 UTC,"A rule of thumb is just that -  not an absolute rule, but a safe guide to work with. However, in your example calling a plumber in Wichita is much cheaper than in San Francisco. Costs will definitely not be the same. But in San Francisco, you are mostly paying for land, not the house. If you buy a million dollar house in Wichita, you are buying a mansion, and that will have incredibly high maintenance costs. Regardless, if you are shopping in the million dollar range, then hopefully you know your finances well enough to not need rule of thumbs."
boston,3di2c3,jokeres,2,Thu Jul 16 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"It depends if you're willing to pay interest. When possible, minimize interest payments - it's money you're paying directly to the bank for no actual benefit, unless you can beat the interest payments by investing that money.

Plus, you know - weed is functionally legal and there are no mosquitoes to speak of - and those things do make a pretty big difference in quality of life for me.

Lots of South Weymouth is nice, and parts of East Weymouth and the Weymouth Heights are as well.  Heroin is a problem here, but it is for most of the state as well. There was an article posted here recently that I can't find that named the 20 or 30 towns with the worst heroin problems, and Weymouth wasn't one of them, much to my surprise.  The highschool sucks, but a lot of the middle and primary schools are pretty good.  Weymouth's biggest problems are the perceptions of it. It's not nearly as bad as many people say it is, but has a bad reputation. It's also surrounded by towns that are much nicer than it. It's the last town on the coast before you start getting to the rich towns. Lastly, it's not growing as fast as its direct competitors- Quincy and Braintree.  Also, i's a very ""townie"" town. A lot of blue collar workers here, mainly white. Not terribly diverse, and the people can be a bit outspoken at times, but it's not bad.  Would I live in Weymouth if I made 200k a year? Probably not. Do I have a problem with buying a house and raising a family here? Not at all with the caveat I'd try to send my kids to a private highschool if possible.  I just hope people don't catch on that Weymouth has more potential than it appears before I'm ready to buy. Let Braintree and Quincy soak up the next wave for two or three years."

My original monthly payment was $397/mo at a 10 year repayment, but I kinda wrecked my savings in the short term by making an $8,000 payment right away, bringing my monthly payment down to $327/mo.

""Greater London"" was created in the 60s as part of an effort to unify all of the area's 32 boroughs into one municipality, governed by a mayor and a city council. For historic reasons, the City of London (the square mile in the center that consists of the ancient city) retained some nominal separation, and is governed in name by the Lord Mayor of London (a largely ceremonial position) and the Corporation of the City of London. However, while the Corporation administers some local services, ultimate authority lies with the Mayor of London (Boris Johnson) and the London City Council, which also governs the other 32 boroughs. Interestingly enough, those boroughs also have ceremonial mayors.  Saying ""Greater London"" is not the same thing as saying ""Greater Boston"", which implies a city and its surrounding towns.

They have horrible selection bias and even worse margins of error.  Shitty businesses like comcast and mcdonalds are immune from their harm, and good local businesses that bust their ass can get taken down by a few bad eggs who are equal parts entitled and confused.  I realize that there aren't many alternatives, but that doesn't mean you're not better off with a magic eight ball.  I applaud anyone who commits and gets away with obvious fraud on that website because it exposes it for the cess pool it truly is.  If they wanted to give users actual data on what people think about businesses they could by moving away from narrative reviews and switching to randomized surveys or other forms of legitimate and unbiased polling.  It would be easy to do.  However, right now their site is as predictive of business quality as random street people being interviewed by the local news are of election results.

boston,3dj676,Texasian,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:48:06 2015 UTC,"the brutal winter had nothing to do with the timeline though. this timeline was set right when the station was closed, literally a year before that brutal winter began.  a private company would have had the work done much quicker, and they would have found ways to keep the station open for parts of the renovation as well. we would have been talking months, not years.  it's amazing how quick this sub is to give them a pass for shutting down for 2 years for a little bit of construction. massive buildings throughout boston have been built from the ground up in half the time this renovation took."
boston,3dj676,reaper527,2,Fri Jul 17 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"Private contractors are the ones renovating the fucking station. There also the ones who performed the design and engineering work. 2 years to renovate a 116yr old station, install elevator shafts and bring every facet of station circulation up to ADA-grade is not an easy project for any organization private or public. The only portion that's controversial is the headhouse (which the BRA had input on), but that's a small part of the project and doesn't add or detract from the 2 year program's timeline.   Unless you've got a thorough understanding station design and subterranean engineering (and are willing to share it for the rest of us plebs) then your points are moot. Can you provide a similar project conducted wholly within the private sphere that supports your points?  Otherwise there's no debate to be had because you have nothing remotely important to say. Most of the MBTA's and MassDOT's construction projects are handled privately. Anyone who's driven under the Harvard Yard underpass by Mem Hall can attest that private doesn't de facto equal better (fwiw this is the private contractor used the wrong cement mixture causing their renovations to crumble less than a year after their initial work, leading to another's year's worth of patch-ups)."

Nor is it because of rich people living in luxury condos.  It's because of this bureaucratic monstrosity making it difficult or impossible for developers to build.  It's that simple.  Prices are driven by supply and demand.  When demand rises and supply is not allowed to rise with it, prices will."
boston,3di8hz,doc89,2,Thu Jul 16 16:10:13 2015 UTC,"Zoning regulations in the city (and it's surrounding areas) are generally absurd. A list of changes that are needed:   Eliminate any and all minimum parking requirements for all types of zoning. If the market demands parking for it's people, the market will build it. Otherwise, don't force me to raise my rent on my tenants because I have to let otherwise buildable and rentable space go towards parking that probably won't even be used.  Dramatically raise the allowable dwelling units per acre. There is literally no reason why there should be any kind of upper limit in the denser parts of the city, and even less so for the less-dense parts of the city. In fact, there really should really be residentdensity minimums to maximize the land productivity. Running out of room on the sidewalks for people to walk? Take away some of the road and add some more sidewalk. There should be no issue with traffic since ideally less people would be driving anyway.  Isolate zones based on their possible disturbances to residents, rather that what people subjectively consider as ""desirable"". For instance, it's rather ridiculous to prohibit office units next to/near residential units. Doing so only increases the distance people need to travel to their destinations (Obvious regulations should be in place to prevent uses that are inherently disruptive to residences from being immediately adjacent). In essence, anything that would involve any kind of dirty/loud/heavy industry should at least be isolated from the residences by some commercial/office zoning. You could even have light industrial next to residential buildings if proper noise ordinances were put in place.  Encourage/require mixed-use zoning (floor level retail with residential/commercial in the upper floors) for areas with higher densities.  Streamline the permitting process such that new developments don't need to stall on bureaucratic red tape and drawn out community feedback processes, such that they only need to pass a minimal set of zoning and regulatory requirements to start the building process.  Establish a database of historic buildings that would be considered off-limits for new development, to prevent market forces from totally remodeling the entire city."

Even if lots more houses were to be built, even past the point where home developers could turn a profit on it, the rent will continue to go up 10% per year.

boston,3di8hz,B0pp0,-2,Fri Jul 17 00:13:52 2015 UTC,"QE will go on forever, because the alternative is to raise interest rates which will cause hyperinflation after a flight from the dollar when people realize that they are not getting their money back.  I think the 15 year plan is for the government to build up as much debt as possible, then there will be a default on paying back pennies on the dollar of us treasuries.  It's going to make the 2008 recession look like a walk in the park, people will have to be drummed up to hate some straw men and great lies will be spun to get the people to not overthrow the government when this takes place.  I'm not a career economist or financial analyst, but I try to understand it the best I can, and from what I can gather, a tipping point will be reached where the choices are going to be gold going up to 100 thousand dollars an ounce and having a fiat currency refresh (throw out USD in adoption of a new currency) or the treasury defaulting and acknowledging that the people who loaned will not be getting back any money on that loan.    The stroke of a pen in the highest levels of government can defy most anything, but the one thing that cannot be defied by fiat is the laws of physics.  If I'm right, the correct action is to join the dog pile and take out a $300k loan and buy something of value, like piece of expensive construction equipment, land, commodities, things that have intrinsic value, then after the reset, pay them back with monopoly money.  If I'm wrong and the fed can bring us in for a ""soft landing"" then keeping claims on future human labor in the form of collecting receipts is the best store of value with a guaranteed loss of 2% to 8% per year that can be partially or mostly offset by keeping it in the stock market or other USD denominated growth instruments.    I want the truth.  But it's so hard to find in a whirlwind of lies.  What happens depends on what people think.  I get the feeling that a 100 year event is brewing.  I can only write and sell you so many IOU's before you start wondering: ""Wait, how can you pay this all back?"" and cease exchanging my paper for human labor.  When you stop taking my receipts, I'm going to have to do my own work myself.  And I'll be living in the house of pain as I realize I can't even make the interest payments on the stuff I have.  And I'll be like a family that's living a 200 thousand dollar a year lifestyle on minimum wage.  The repo-man is going to come a knocking, and he doesn't take ""go away"" for an answer.  The families assets vanish, and they will be forced to go back to living a minimum wage lifestyle.  This makes the little kids in the house upset about the deterioration of luxuries.  And they start burning cities in protest.  Something like this was what caused world war 2.     So if it happens to us in the next few years and it goes badly, it may start World War 3 as all the nations jocky for the next 200 year installment of ""Who wants to be the king of the mountain global superpower?"".

boston,3di8hz,_ImOnRedditAtWork,8,Thu Jul 16 16:50:00 2015 UTC,"we need to throw more money at them.   Redevelopment agencies very rarely need money, it's one of the few (sorta-)public agencies that can really rake it in without relying on public subsidy; money's never been the BRA's major issue. Don't mix it up with the MBTA debate. The BRA's been gutted, reinforced, and mangled so many times by the powers-that-be over even Kafka would think it's makes no fucking sense. ""Byzantine processes"" is being nice - there's no reasonable excuse for not having a city-wide master plan and district/block level plans or bungling the development review processes. There's a lot of good people at the BRA, but good people without a coherent mission...can't be defended. Needs to be better."
boston,3di8hz,CantabKBH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:05:14 2015 UTC,"I agree the BRA doesn't need tax money, however, they make most of their money by being gifted land from the city and then selling it to developers. Those funds should be going back to the city.  In the 1970s, the federal government stopped funding redevelopment authorities. This system of selling land is how the BRA figured out how to fund itself and Menio supported as it let him advance his agenda on development without having a direct, visible connection to the decisions being made."
boston,3di8hz,vitaminq,2,Thu Jul 16 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"In theory, the revenue generated by the BRA does go back into the City (excluding wages for staffers). In practice...different story - that's what the 2014 audit fleshed out. In certain instances, developers can buy themselves out of affordable unit percentage through a contribution to the BRA's affordability fund - in too many instances that fee was never assessed or assessed but never collected (along with the failure to collect other rightly-owed lease payments). So the funds do go in to the city, or they would if the BRA did it right. Also I'd argue not so much being gifted land, as it is just being the City's agency tasked with most of the land disposition.   Also worth noting the BRA was built by Ed Logue to be a quasi-public fiefdom akin to Callahan's Turnpike Authority. It was designed to effect considerable power in the City so Flynn and Menino (the post-Logue mayors) didn't really alter the way the BRA was supposed to operate in any meaningful ways - they just ensconced himself at the top of the pyramid and made damn well sure the agency supported their goals and his political directives. Selling land sustained the BRA in the Reagan ""fuck the cities"" era, but there's no way a body that guards the real estate money gates in and out of the City would've disappeared, way too much useful as a political tool.   My point isn't pro-/anti-BRA, it's a pro-modern planning agency. Given the current 'private' sector is better 10000% of the time sentiment, there's always the looming threat that shitty-fucking performance by a public agency could lead to abolishing that agency. That'd be a mistake, Boston needs a BRA, period, whether or not it is this BRA..."

Menino, who critics say was too involved in deciding what got built in Boston.   seeing as it tries to say that walsh is trying to be more hands off in deciding who gets to build, and this article comes a day after walsh was telling trump he couldn't build in boston if he wanted to."

The street grid and the blocks it defines in the SBW are too big (as in the blocks are too big) and too big in areas that no longer need the wide boulevards to trucks about goods/freight. A grid filters more traffic than an artery per day and it can absorb a lot without cascading congestion but only if it's sized appropriately. The SBW road layout was never seriously altered, the blocks are too long and too deep to effectively disperse traffic so everything gets jammed at the lights. The large blocks were also parceled out wholesale which ended up (obviously) in a bunch of superblock developments (you know the game, developers will always, always try and maximize ROI - the City needs to set the rules via a master plan if they want something other than glassy superblocks, as long as they're offering massive parcels to developers that's what they're going to get in return). It also ended up with the three major multi-building developments (Pier 4, Fallon's holdings, and the Seaport Sq parcels) in the hands a small cadre of owners (though each parcel is financed, developed, designed separately).   The BRA doesn't involve itself in transit planning (which a lot of city planning agencies do), but they paid all the same lip service to the MBTA's pipe dream plans for SLIII. Rhetorical support is okay, but nothing was ever going to come from it - any transit rider (except the tiny cohort that does the SL4/5 to SL1/2 dance and Southie bus riders) headed to the SBW must now cross through or transfer at the most congested section anywhere in the entire system (Park-DTX-SS). As the Seaport grows, attracts workers and residents it's going to induce more people into an overcrowded segment and any delays because of it are going to ripple out over the whole system from there.   The City needs to set the rules to the game and needs to be the one dictating what the development goals for the Seaport are. Without a master plan, the developers make all the meaningful decisions and the scope of their interest is pretty narrowly focused on their developments and not how the neighborhood works as a whole. They'll make a lot of dinero either way - a master plan doesn't detract from the immense value of sites like these, if anything it secures developers by offering an easy to follow template they can then show to interested investors. The City didn't have the appropriate plan in place, however; so all the above is moot.   The whole affordability (I don't believe the SBW needs to be affordable, honestly), quality of life discussion is something you can only really have if there's a master plan in place. Otherwise the grocery store question ends up in the same ""what comes first, chicken-or-the-egg"" debate that's happening over in Kendall.   EDIT: just to be clear, we're talking opportunity costs here - the SBW is a monumental improvement for the city as is"

boston,3dnp78,_insidesource_,2,Fri Jul 17 20:16:11 2015 UTC,"Hey! Sure, it's on Saluation, that is a tiny alleyway street off of Hanover, towards the end of Hanover and then Commercial on the other end. Not sure if you know the N End. Anyhow, 550 square feet, heat and hot water included, 2350 but you may be able to talk the owner down to 2325 or 2300. We have a cat I am not sure if he still accepts pets and probably not dogs. It's the top floor, 4th floor walk up so there are two skylights, it's very bright and sunny. Open layout kitchen and living room all one space. A hallway then a pretty sizable bedroom for the N End. Fits a queen bed for us, two dressers and a crib with a little walking space. Lots of cabinet space and lots of cabinet space in the bathroom. Not one of these old places where you are thinking WTF will I put my things??? Coat closet when you walk in, lots of space on top too. Close to a walk in closet in the hallway, a linen closet as well. Free storage unit downstairs, it's private with a lock. Free laundry downstairs. Because it's the penthouse, you have private access to a very nice, well kept roof deck. Gas grill included and it's part of the gas bill covered in the rent. I think the table and umbrella will stay. We will take the two chairs because we purchased them. It's a super quiet building and street. I live here with a kid and never had a problem. Only moving because we need more space can't afford a 2 bed in the North End. I lived here a long time with just my husband so it worked well for two people. But landlord will only consider couples not roommates. He is super nice, hands off but will fix everything asap. Microwave, dishwasher are brand new. Just fixed all of the cabinets last month. It needs a paint job and the floors don't look so hot. But we are moving out earlier than Sept 1st and he is going to professionally clean, paint, and clean/buff the floors make them pretty again. You are minutes away from the Harbor, CC Park. And you can see the New Year's Fireworks from the Boston Harbor from the roof deck no problem and the 4th of the July Fireworks that they must have somewhere near East Boston. The views are really nice on the roof deck. I will miss our fucking roof deck man. Great parties up there. No running water on the deck though. I don't know if that is crazy out of your price range, he had it at 2500 which I thought was too high and he lowered it recently. Closets have lights...dimmer in living room. OK I think I babbled enough. It probably looks crowded to people who view it because we have two people and a baby in here, plus the pain and floors don't do it any favors. But if it's just you or you and a SO there is a lot of space and it will look much newer with paint and new floors. Ask for new blinds as well. Oh and an AC unit in the bedroom is yours/ not central AC."

I had planned on doing the ol' park 'n' ride outside the city like one might do here, only to find that their transit system didn't have garages that allowed overnight parking like some of ours do. I'd resisted asking the city's subreddit for parking suggestions because I didn't want to be ""that guy,"" but in hindsight that would've made my experience getting in much less stressful.  I actually didn't mind paying for a garage, but it would have been nice to have a clear picture of where to go, rather than blindly driving around downtown after my initial, admittedly poorly researched plan, fell through."

Whether they build new buildings or they convert current apartment buildings to dorms, it would work. Capacity would remain the same, but you then have a situation that is rent controlled (By the schools) which keeps the prices of other apartments down for families and young professionals."

And, vven if 128 is a reasonable cutoff, they also exclude parts of Boston Harbor, including Nahant, where Northeastern's Marine Science Center is.

I don't know if and/or how much BU was willing to spend or if there was a realistic chance after Harvard scooped up the first bit in 2000. I am sure as fuck, however, that I wouldn't want to bid against Harvard's landbanking/real estate crew - no one's winning a bidding war against a personal endowment that'd clock in as the 90th largest national economy if it were GDP.    Poor BU, I (almost) feel bad for them (nah I do actually, 'terriers' is the best mascot in town) - all they've ever wanted was a proper, secluded campus just like Harvard or MIT. The Embankment Rd/Storrow project severed them from the River, a few misplaced 50s-70s era campus buildings kinda deadened the look, but they would've had far more pressure to expand and expand quickly into the land vacated by I-90 realignment - now Harvard will sit on it for who knows how long. BU would probably also have been an important partner in stitching back together Lower Allston and Comm Ave and making West Station work to it's fullest potential, but since they now receive no explicit benefit from the I-90 project they've started to moan, drag their feet, and obstruct some of the West Station and transpo plans for the area.

boston,3dea32,itsonlyastrongbuzz,4,Wed Jul 15 20:57:48 2015 UTC,it is at least out of date. Harvard's land holdings have changed slightly. So have Boston University's. I don't find that to be a huge deal though.

boston,3dea32,Pandatrocity,3,Wed Jul 15 23:45:43 2015 UTC,"The map shows Brighton Mills Shopping Center (PetCo, Star Market, etc.) as part of Harvard.  It shows the DoubleTree Hotel as part of Harvard.  It shows the Boston Tech Center as part of Harvard, which has never had a tenant in the 15 years since completion and will be torn down to make way for the new Boston Skating Club.  All those properties are owned by Harvard, but really aren't part of the campus. So, I guess one could say the map is inaccurate in that there are many areas marked that aren't part of the campuses, but instead are just owned by the universities."
boston,3dea32,causticx,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:52:40 2015 UTC,"The map shows Brighton Mills Shopping Center (PetCo, Star Market, etc.) as part of Harvard.   Harvard owns significant real estate here. They built the apartments here over the past few years, they're 'replacement' apartments for the Section 8 apartments they owned near HBS.  Harvard owns a significant portion of Allston near N Harvard/Western. This isn't a map, but makes clear mention of Harvard's holdings: http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/03/allston%E2%80%99s-retail-profile-rising/  But I think in theory I agree, real estate holdings aren't what this map is suppose to measure."

Michael Christmas is one rapper who got the attention of the indie blogosphere with a couple of his recent releases. Slaine is another popular rapper from Boston.  Going further back rappers like Esoteric and Gang Starr started out in Boston I believe.  Edit: Since Boston is such a big touring stop and has a pretty big hip-hop fanbase despite the lack of a thriving local scene, most of the larger acts will stop here. The House of Blues by Fenway, Middle East in Cambridge, the Paradise Rock Club on Comm Ave, and the Royale in the theatre district will have a pretty steady slew of hip-hop shows.

The only good speaker was the first lady, who was the President of the Massachusetts Teacher's Union (can't remember her name). But even still, none of the speakers really talked specifically about Bernie and his platform. There was no discussion of the specifics of the platform that Bernie is campaigning on or any concrete actions his supporters can take to get the word out about Bernie and his platform. Also there was one speaker, a 16 yr old from Cambridge, and while she had a lot of passion, she is definitely not someone I would want to be representing this group.   The organizers had people go into breakout groups to discuss to discuss action plans for different topics. This was also disappointing.

Wait, no, hear me out:  It was a bunch of people getting together to hear speeches about how great Bernie Sanders is, how great Socialism is, and how the movement that they consider themselves part of is awesome.  They're not wrong, but what exactly is the benefit to gathering together to go ""Rah rah Bernie Sanders is great"" for two hours? The rally didn't actually do anything. You have a mixed audience of dedicated Bernie supporters and on-the-fence curious voters, and instead of any actionable impetus to advance Bernie's campaign or persuasive conversation to sway moderates, we just shout into an echo chamber. That, to me, is a circlejerk.  Furthermore, two of their three speakers were ineligible to vote for Bernie Sanders. One was a sixteen year old who will not be of voting age by the primary, and one was a Brazillian national. Their speeches were heartfelt and genuine, but they're completely irrelevant to a campaign to gather votes."

And I don't think they're inspiring anyone else who wasn't fairly well decided beforehand, either. I said,   instead of any [...] persuasive conversation to sway moderates, we just shout into an echo chamber.   And it was exactly that in the individual speeches. The speakers weren't selling Bernie Sanders to potential swing voters, they were proclaiming the wonderful virtue of their movement and themselves as part of it without any argument or persuasion at all.

So many candidates, political ideologies, local political issues, and none of these rallies ever amount to anything more than circlejerking over our own platform.  There's nothing wrong with wanting a circlejerk. It does make everyone feel better about themselves and it doesn't do any major harm, so I get why it's attractive. A couple hundred people get to feel like they helped without really doing anything, and they can go home feeling super satisfied believing that they matter. That's okay. That's probably pretty good for them.  But I want a rally with objectives."

It seems as if the more detailed campaign organizing is coming later this month, and the objective of this rally was in preparation for that. I wasn't there, so I can't really make any defense of the rally from personal experience - but I also don't think its useful to write it off as a ""circlejerk"" that only took place to make people feel better about themselves.   What kind of things would you like them to do? Beyond discussing issues that are important to them?"
boston,3de3o0,BaldEagleCheezSamich,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:59:22 2015 UTC,"I wasn't there,  I also don't think its useful to write it off as a ""circlejerk""   You didn't go and you're trying to tell me what I saw. Stop that.  I'm not writing it off as circlejerk, I'm describing it as a circlejerk. It was a perfectly valuable circlejerk. An echo chamber is not a useless event, it's just not as useful as what we had an opportunity for. Which is a great segue to   What kind of things would you like them to do? Beyond discussing issues that are important to them?   I want them to do two things, because I think there are two kinds of people in attendance (well, three, but...). The audience is a mix of Bernie supporters and undecided voters. This is the crowd we have gathered, so let's make use of it. (Also present will be a third group of voters decidedly against Bernie but what can you do there?)  For undecided voters, I want to neutrally outline a debate of Bernie Sanders' platform to show that we are not afraid of criticisms of our platform. Show this audience both sides of the issue and the conclusions we have drawn from them. Here are the reasons these Bernie supporters are so energized and so motivated to come out here tonight and take action without getting paid. Don't push it as a ""rah rah we're great"" circlejerk because that makes us look self-important and self-assuming. Instead, humbly propose that this plan, this platform, is effective at accomplishing its goals and that its goals are aligned with those of the voters. Now you've recruited some Bernie supporters that you didn't have before the rally and you've armed the existing Bernie supporters with both zeal and a great argument.  And for those already Bernie supporters, I want the rally to tell people what to do, in clear, simple instructive fashion - here are the teams you can join, here are the jobs you can take on, here are the tasks we can accomplish, and this is how those teams, jobs, and tasks will lead to our political goals. You don't need to sell Bernie Sanders to these people, you need to satisfy their desire to help. The circlejerk does that for some of them, but it's an empty satisfaction - it reenergizes their dedication to the campaign but it fails to utilize them at all. Energizing the base is important, but the purpose of energizing the base is to get them pumped up enough to do something with that energy. You have a self-assembled task force of considerable available man-hours. Utilize the hell out of that. Collecting their contact information is nice, but I've done this before, and over and over the only thing that happens is I get more campaign emails that just continue the circlejerk in digital form. I am not expecting the campaign to make full use of these people as volunteers, I've seen these things before."

Sounds like you have a good idea of what you want from a rally. Thanks for your response, and sorry to have commented after not attending."
boston,3de3o0,BaldEagleCheezSamich,-5,Thu Jul 16 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"They're not wrong, but what exactly is the benefit to gathering together to go ""Rah rah Bernie Sanders is great"" for two hours? The rally didn't actually do anything   None of the speeches do anything if that is your line of reasoning. I would prefer a politician speak to their supporters wherever he goes. It is important for them to speak to regular people even if it is speaking to the choir."

boston,3ddj7o,KeepMarijuanaIllegal,3,Thu Jul 16 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"I think the idea would be to tear it down, put back in the street grid of scollay square, or there abouts,and keep enough land for the new building ( hopefully in a more classical or federalist style). Then sell or lease the rest of the lots to fund it. Scollay square returned to existence and we get a new city hall for relatively cheap."

Developers like sure bets, they like the normal order and the status quo - when the housing and credit markets are still recovering from a recession, developers want sure-things and sure-things aren't usually exciting or interesting things. There's no excuse for the street-level fuck-ups (looking at you Kensington and [insert barren glass street wall] in the Seaport), but B- architecture has an attractive cost-benefit ratio.   That's starting to change - look at the plans for the Congress St Garage, Avalon Nashua, the Garden Towers, the ""whatever happened to this one"" Garden Garage Tower(s), the small infill/streetscape stuff like Quaker Ln and the medium-sized projects in Bulfinch Triangle. Not any of it ""oh my fucking god"" architecture, but it's solid enough, tightly-packed, better than the early 2000s stuff, and it's going to tie Bulfinch and North Station back into downtown. That's what B- architecture is good for, and it provides the necessary background for truly interesting projects.  As /u/itsonlyastrongbuzz said, the only thing worse than B- architecture is too much A+ architecture. We don't need Calatrava setting piles of money on fire for ostentatious but useless purposes. MIT had an unwritten policy for years of having each new building designed by a respect and ""in"" modern architect and that whole campus is disjointed and incoherent. I'd take Fenway Point over the Stata any day."

boston,3ddj7o,bakgwailo,8,Wed Jul 15 19:11:46 2015 UTC,"Boston has a dense concentration of modernist architecture. Harvard GSD and MIT got into a modernist dick measuring contest in the early 50s and that attracted the likes of Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, and later on people like Sert and Pei and Cobb - it's no coincidence that the only Corbusier building in the US (North America?) is in Cambridge. We have enough modernist projects to be able to make a objective comparison and in that comparison Gov Center fails. Modernist city planning was so so wrong on certain facets of urban life that I can't separate the theory from the architecture - Gov Center represents for a lot us the ""wrongness"" of modernism. There are a few modernist buildings that get it right, Sert (BU Law, Holyoke Center, Peabody Terrace) at least understood that his buildings are in a city, so I don't like the look but I can appreciate the buildings function. Can't do that with GC.  Also worth mentioning that a lot of the South End Victorians were conservative, play it safe for their time. They've fared well, and the North End, which is just an unplanned tenement slum with little attention payed to making the buildings look good. Playing it safe can look good too, I think a lot (not all) of the small infill in Southie is respectable."
boston,3ddj7o,CantabKBH,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"Actually have always loved the BU law building!  Can you elaborate on the ""wrongness"" of Government Center in context with the modernist architecture?  Is modernism generally regarded as being unsuitable for urban environments?"
boston,3ddj7o,skcali,6,Wed Jul 15 19:42:47 2015 UTC,"Modernism in Boston goes hand in hand with urban renewal and highway monies pouring into the states, the ""New Boston"" mentality, economic development, a sea-change in lifestyles, and obliterated local economy, and the downsides of the aforementioned things. GC et al are representative of an important time, but a fucking tumultuous one with everything from redlining, suburbanization, urban renewal knockdowns, racial and social issues, and smoldering economy - so not one anyone's keen on reliving. That's what I mean when it represents 'wrongness' of the time - it's an emotional statement more than anything.  Functional modernism was riddled with some odd fucking ideas, the car was to be accommodated at all costs, there had to be massive break with the past, the idea was it was a completely new era and it needed completely need ideas about how to order the city and they fucked up some shit along the way by not realizing decimating city blocks might do more harm than good. Then the funding ran out for some and/or people got cold-feet and switched up some plans - and the social problems in (and in a way related to the design of) the modernist-inspired housing projects sorta killed off the movement."
boston,3ddj7o,CantabKBH,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:17:59 2015 UTC,"Very interesting read.  I'm familiar with the destruction of Scollay Square and the impacts of poorly implemented urban renewal, and can definitely understand the negative opinions towards GC from concept to execution.  I just feel like it's an easy knee-jerk reaction for most people to walk by and say ""Gross blocky concrete, who thought of that?"".  As someone who is coming more from the art/design world, I think it's always important to consider the relevance of a painting/sculpture/work in the context of its time period.  I try to do the same with architecture (but still clearly don't really know what I'm talking about).  Thanks again for the read."
boston,3ddj7o,skcali,2,Thu Jul 16 13:00:52 2015 UTC,"Modernism is a broad stroke.  To be specific, Government Center, and buildings like it are considered ""Brutalist.""  They have not fared well as, while appearing minimalist, are more dystopian shade of futuristic."

boston,3ddj7o,bakgwailo,4,Thu Jul 16 03:41:23 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree.  I agree that it was era-appropriate insofar as Brutalist Architecture became popular while this was being designed/built, but I disagree that was the best option.  Look at Lincoln Center in Manhattan, built around the same time. It's still gorgeous. I mean, it's no comparison, and they were built around the same time.  I agree on the ""let's play it safe"" attitude, but let's also not pretend like everything has to be swinging for the fences.

boston,3deqjr,Rain12913,14,Wed Jul 15 18:31:36 2015 UTC,"There are two general answers here, the ideal answer or the way it should be is to continue to call the police. If there is an issue with the police responding, you can file complaints against the responding officers.  On top of that you should also continue to contact the landlord, and keep a log of all correspondences. If the landlord continues to refuse to respond to the issues you can contact the Boston Rental Housing Center for help. They can assist or direct you to proper assistance.  You can also contact local news organizations, if the LL is a public figure chances are they don't want it known that they allowed their female tenants to be harassed and threatened by shady men.   On top of that you can threaten to break the lease and move out. Its a very bold option but in the end it should work out.    Realistically none of the options above are very likely to solve the problem. You should still very much try all of them, but don't hope for too much.  The easiest option is to try to find another place to live. It sucks, but its honestly easier than trying to take on the police and a local political figure.

Landlord has expressed anger that the police were involved, even though he chose not to act when he was made aware of the situation. He's a smart enough guy to know that he could be sued if bodily harm or vandalism occurred. Not to mention it would tack on a few more election losses to his current streak.

The city pulled the previous developer's building permits and forced them out.   Isn't what happened. Vornado's strategy was to hold property hostage in hopes of forcing whatever government into providing more generous tax break/subsidies. The CEO even said as much in an interview with WSJ or someshit, Menino read it, decided it wasn't in Boston's or Downtown Crossing's interest to have the fucking hole owned by someone trying to extort public monies - and he forced them to either a) build or b) sell. They sold.  You don't live in a dictatorship, it's not he the bad old Curley days, this stuff is part and parcel in urban governance like it or not (and there's plenty not to like) and what Walsh is saying is pretty pedestrian, cheap political points, nothing more sinister."
boston,3daq7o,CantabKBH,6,Wed Jul 15 09:11:53 2015 UTC,Vornado is perfect at dragging their heels at development. I know of sites that they bought decades ago that are still not fully redeveloped.
boston,3daq7o,B0pp0,2,Wed Jul 15 10:25:45 2015 UTC,"he forced them to either a) build or b) sell. They sold.   This is false.  He forced them to sell.  Yes, Vornado had shitty business practices, but the way the city went after them was an expropriation from Vornado to whichever developer would buy the site.  The city revoked their permits, which caused the value of the property to go down, and when they wanted to start building again, the city refused to give them new permits.  You see how that's unequal treatment?  Vornado wasn't allowed to repermit, while any firm buying the land would be able to."
boston,3daq7o,MoneyChurch,6,Wed Jul 15 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"Shitty business practices? Vornado created the goddamn hole in the first place and let it fester in hopes that the post-Recession public investment filtering down from Federal and State coffers would come to him. That's not bad practice, but trying to a leverage a literal fucking hole in the middle of Menino's desired Downtown Crossing regeneration was a risk that either succeeds wildly with or fails miserably. Roth might've have won too, if he hadn't opened his big fucking mouth to brag that he purposefully sits on deteriorating properties to win public subsidies for projects he doesn't actually need the financial support for.   You can't taunt a mayor with a blighted property in a humiliating corner of whatever city's shopping district and you especially can't do that when that Mayor operates in a strong mayor system with a powerful, quasi-public entity with considerable power like the BRA. As unseemly as it looks, nothing Menino nor the BRA did was a) illegal, or b) negative for the common good in this instance.  It's not unequal treatment, or unfair; it's the treatment you can expect for being a conniving fucking moron in a city with consdirable public influence in development. Vornado had it's chance to build, they were hit by the recession, they then refused to execute their plans when the credit market was rebounding, and bragged about trying to embarrass the city into giving them tax payers dollars. Even if the city had gone all the way and declared the property blighted, Vornado still wouldn't have a leg to stand on since their plan hinged on the property being...well...blighted.   FWIW, Vornado afaik is minor partner in Millennium so it's not like they were cut completely out of the deal."

Since then Walsh has been locking support down in the areas he didn't win in the primaries, he's appointed a school chief who largely agrees with the views of Connolly (who ran on charters and improvements in the educational system) and he's kept the developers happy and secure that there isn't any craziness post-Menino.

boston,3daq7o,fedorco,2,Wed Jul 15 15:33:28 2015 UTC,Is it not common in business to not cut deals on the basis that you don't like that person?
boston,3daq7o,goonersaurus_rex,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:55:26 2015 UTC,"Certainly.  Business to business deals often are made/broken on personal relationships.  And if the City were engaged in a contract with Trump it would be great to see them dissolve it.    But this is not a deal between two parties.  This would be a business entity trying to get approval from the city to build a business.  That's not a business transaction that is merely government oversight - and when it is government oversight there should never be any discrimination based on the views held by the applicant.  I am not particularly comfortable with Walsh implying that if he finds your beliefs abhorrent, he can make it difficult for you to do business in Boston.  As I mentioned before, I agree with Walsh's sentiment, but personal beliefs should not prevent an individual from doing business in our city."
boston,3daq7o,taekwondogirl,4,Wed Jul 15 18:54:34 2015 UTC,"Unless you think doing so could negatively impact your city base, or affect the economy, or any number of things. There's already been a clear negative financial impact for things Trump's said; look at how many companies have dropped him."
boston,3daq7o,goonersaurus_rex,3,Wed Jul 15 03:18:08 2015 UTC,"But unfortunately the mayor's comments are predicated on Trumps campaign rhetoric.   I'm fine with private contracts and business relationships being cancelled because of backwards views. In fact it's a great way for the market to punish Trump. If Boston had contracts with Trump for services or events, it would be a great statement to cancel. I would be ok with that. That's not this scenario.   This is Walsh saying that if you believe something I fundamentally view as abhorrent, I will not let you do business in my city.   Both Walsh and Menino did this. I had no issue with the sentiment underlying it - but the tactic of blocking someone's business actions off of personal belief I take some issue with"
boston,3daq7o,thelightningstrike,2,Wed Jul 15 12:06:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that I buy the (implicit) argument that ""doing business"" is a fundamental right, there are plenty of reasons why people/companies are restricted from commerce in various states/countries/regions. While I think this is likely to be super inconsistent (plenty of people in this city have repugnant views and Walsh happily takes their money), and ineffective. What i don't like is the Mayor having that much unilateral power. Will he speak out against someone who previously (or currently) donates lots of money to him?"
boston,3daq7o,goonersaurus_rex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:43:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you say, with one minor counterpoint.  Doing business is not a fundamental right, and certain restrictions to commerce are perfectly acceptable.  That the head of a company (the individual - not business) holds a particular viewpoint and expresses said viewpoint (so long as it's a legal one) should not restrict the ability of his company to do business in a city."

I totally think trump is overrated as a true businessman and a huge turd. But buried in the pig pile is some truths regarding how we handle immigration and the lack enforcement we have for our own laws. There are violent criminals exploiting the system and there has been a large uptick in diseases that we have not seen in decades because of the lax enforcement.
boston,3daq7o,Jsm1370,17,Wed Jul 15 16:21:35 2015 UTC,"the lack enforcement we have for our own laws.   There's nothing more American than not respecting laws you don't believe in.  Look at Prohibition for chrissake.  Furthermore, they're breaking a law because our racist immigration laws won't let them in. The path to immigration is absurd... All our families had to do was walk down a gangway into Ellis Island, sign our name, and get checked for ticks.   There are violent criminals exploiting the system   You're using border violence via drug cartels to deprive others from an opportunity in a new world that all of our families had.   large uptick in diseases that we have not seen in decades because of the lax enforcement.   Yeah, it's the immigrants, not the uptick in kids not being vaccinated."

I know people like you think open borders are harmless, they don't move to your communities. But in the south west and in California they are putting a huge strain on services. They also negatively impact the working poor in the U.S. because they are adding competition and depressing wages. I know your simplistic answer is to raise the minimum wage, but it's not that simple in the real world.   Let me ask you this, what do we do with the glut of low skilled labor when robotics start wiping out their jobs in 10 years?  There are laws I don't agree with, does that mean I get to disregard them. We are a nation of jobs and to use an analogy comparing the immigration process now to 100 years ago is laughable.

The quotas for ""Mediterranean"" people were different than those for ""Alpine"" and ""Nordic"" people. The intent was to curb Asians, Jews, Italians, and Eastern Europeans.  The entire movement was based on the widespread idealism from ""The Passing of the Great Race,"" a Eugenics promoting book by Madison Grant, which would go on to inspire Himmler and the Nazi's.  If the laws place different limitations based on different countries, it is racist by definition.   I know people like you think open borders are harmless, they don't move to your communities. But in the south west and in California they are putting a huge strain on services   It's almost like that'd be a good reason to make them citizens, so their salary would be taxed and on the books, and they'd be paying into the system.   They also negatively impact the working poor in the U.S. because they are adding competition and depressing wages.   It's our own fault that we have soo many working poor.  Maybe if we spent half as much on education as we did on our penal system and defense sector, we could make higher education more accessible and a reality for more of our citizens.  That's our own fault.   I know your simplistic answer is to raise the minimum wage, but it's not that simple in the real world.   Except in Australia, where they have a $17 AUD/hour minimum wage (about $13 USD/hr) and currently have a lower unemployment.  When you pay the poor more, they tend to spend more.  There's a lot more poor people than rich people.  It's good for the economy.   Let me ask you this, what do we do with the glut of low skilled labor when robotics start wiping out their jobs in 10 years?   I hope you're not really trying to defend your immigration stance with hypothetical questions.   There are laws I don't agree with, does that mean I get to disregard them.    So you've never broken a law?   There are laws I don't agree with, does that mean I get to disregard them. We are a nation of jobs and to use an analogy comparing the immigration process now to 100 years ago is laughable.

Hell, we wrote the Monroe Doctrine, didn't we? Isn't our sacred duty to police the hemisphere? Let's kill some fucking cartels, and stabilize these goddamn countries so that people won't want to leave.  Or we could leave them economically weak and open to outside influence, which is why China is building it's own goddamn Canal through Nicaragua so that it could bypass Panama.  Irrespective of that, we should be funding NASA and space exploration. You think Defense spending is a boon to the economy? Sure, it is, but it also incentivizes us to never not be at war (Eisenhower's warning against the Military Industrial Complex). Meanwhile for every $1 invested in NASA, $14 is returned to the economy, and it's a fucking bargain compared to Defense spending. The Apollo Space Program, adjusted for 2015 $USD cost $120B. Had we never gone to war in Iraq, we could've landed on the moon, then destroyed everything and started from scratch four times and then still had a trillion left over.  And the best part of the space program is, when you jettison a rocket phase or leave behind a Lunar Rover or landing phase of the LEM... Aliens don't find them and use them against you.

Once this is perfected you will eliminate half the workforce needed to manage a restaurant. It’s only getting worse from there.   That's one very valid argument.  However technology has been replacing jobs for as long as there have been jobs to replace.  Can you imagine telling someone who's entire job was an Elevator Attendant that maybe people can push the buttons themselves?  Or a more contemporary example, that in New Jersey (and other states I can't remember) you can't pump your own gas, which creates the need for an attendant?  Our economy has been and always will be evolving, and frankly we need to evolve with it, else we look like the Taxi Drivers protesting Uber.

You keep talking about processing them and naturalizing them. Ok how many, what levels are sustainable? You never talk to this, only what’s right according to your optics. How many should we accept, how many can we accept are never discussed.   It's not a simple answer.  I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy of an entire nation of immigrants looking down at those who are seeking the same opportunities our forefathers were. We've been grandfathered in, in some cases literally. It'd be like Craig MacTavish calling every other hockey player a giant pussy for wearing helmets, even though they're mandatory at this point, and he'd been grandfathered in.  It'd have to be a dynamic change in education and foreign policy coupled with immigration.  What I do know is the millennial generation is having fewer kids, later in life, so there's a real possibility the economy will need an additional boost to sustain growth in the not too distant future (look at China and their population stagnation stemmed from their One Child Policy).   How we'd feed them and where we'd put them are different problems entirely.   Most open border advocates I see up here in Boston have never had to live with the consequences of unmanaged and unenforced immigration policies. They are working off of theory and no experience from their gentrified pockets in the city or out in the lily white burbs. Or they themselves are illegal aliens.   I myself am white, but I most certainly not emigrate from a gentrified or affluent neighborhood. Most kids in my school were ESL, and the children of refugees from Cambodia, Bosnia, and Central America. And you know what? There are problems that stem from that. They cling to insular immigrant communities which causes a hesitation to assimilate. There's violence and gangs because they feel the need to rely on each other for protection. And you know what? It was a great way to grow up. I grew up with the mindset that America absolutely was the land of opportunity because I saw evidence of it. I didn't grow up in some WASPY hamlet looking at everyone as interlopers and trespassers.  If we're closing our borders we should take down The New Colussus poem on Liberty Island, because we're obviously full of shit to say  *“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” *  PS Sorry if you interpenetrated anything as a personal dig, it's just a less than ideal night's sleep coupled with a less than ideal blood-to-coffee ration"
boston,3daq7o,Enginerdiest,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:28:20 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree with you on our immigration laws. At one time they were racist, but have not been so in a very long time, 60+ years. It is sad, but they are a product of their time, they should be acknowledged, but it is time to move on from them because they hold no bearing on current laws. For the record, my grandparents were considered a mixed race marriage back in the late 20s, Sicilian and Irish by many people. Now it’s common as dirt.    I will give you your due on the bank account information, the Patriot Act has made it difficult to bank as an illegal. I am still not sold on the idea that all will emerge from the shadows and pay taxes, all banking will do it make it easier for the Feds to catch them with tax evasion charges.  I can’t see where you are going on the argument for the military / Monroe doctrine.  Personally I would love it if the US acted in good faith with the areas and went in and helped stabilize them. If Mexico came in and asked help to wipe out the cartels I’d send them as many special forces units as they needed to go in and take them out.  The problem is with the governments of the countries being as bad as the cartels, corruption collusion wise. You are dammed if you do and dammed if you don’t, so we are screwed either way. If you help, your nation building / imperialist, if you mind your own business you’re an uncaring isolationist. So, at the end of the day its best to just have a really big stick, or the biggest stick to keep people honest. If you can’t have respect, fear is the next best thing.  NASA funding definitely needs to be increased. NASA and Military spending has gone hand in hand since the onset of the cold war. However much of NASAs funding is indirectly done though the military. NASA works heavily with Boeing and Lockheed for example. But yes, I agree with you very much on this.  The problem with the onset of robotics is that we are ill prepared to deal with it. In each wave it was clear as to the evolution of jobs. Now, public and private school education are not producing skilled workers / engineers / scientists / biologists at the rate we need them. So, when someone who has been mowing lawns is replaced by a  robot that can drive its self to the lawn, mow it and move to the next one, what are they qualified to do. Now amplify that but those workers here now and the influx of low skilled labor coming over illegally and you can see the problem. Skilled workers or those with means are not entering illegally.  A very good example of this is with the steel industry. At one time up until the early 70s, steel manufacturing was king in the US. With the advent of newer technology, which US Steel manufactures did not invest in, other areas of the world (Japan) caught up to US and surpassed us. The steel workers were generational, and there was little incentive to learn other skills or get a better education. Within 20 years those jobs were gone, and all of the workers were SOL because they did not consider the jobs ever leaving. With no planning or back up plan, the disruption caused by robotics is going to be catastrophic. Mind you I am not some luddite, but the education level has sunk in the last 20 plus years to alarming levels, STEMwise.  We will have to disagree about laws and what constitutes breaking them. I guess if I rolled a D&D character I would be Lawful / Good in my orientation.  It seems that you look at me at being anti-immigration / closed borders. That far from it. I am pro-immigration, I just want to see it managed. Allowing people to come on over at their leisure is not best for anyone long term.  We do agree that assimilation is an issue, I think that unmanaged immigration allows this to drag on and become more problematic.  I think that the laws could be tweaked, but overall they are fine as they stand now, I do not think that the current laws are racist. I think that the country needs a diverse influx of people, both economically and racially, but that influx needs to managed so those individuals can assimilate to the culture here while leaving their imprint on society.  I honestly think we are closer on issues than you might think we are. I guess the main sticking point is open borders.  For the record, I grew up in low income projects for my first 10 years. So I lived around poverty and crime, much unlike some of the very liberal / progressive people I talk to. That’s where my optics come from."
boston,3daq7o,Jsm1370,3,Wed Jul 15 14:36:56 2015 UTC,"Let me ask you this, what do we do with the glut of low skilled labor when robotics start wiping out their jobs in 10 years?   And what are we gonna do with yours when robots wipe it out in 15 years? How do you want to be treated? Maybe that's the way we ought to treat other people.   It's not all or nothing.

When it comes time to move out, a thousand agents will have the master key to your apartment and show it all day and night. That's the worst part. That said, if it is all you can afford... at east try his better buildings on Lancaster Terrace and at 116 Washington. Look for owner ads on craigslist by small landlords.

Go to the Institute of Contemporary Art in the seaport. On your way in to buy tickets, look at that huge ""Art Wall"" on your right. In the lower right hand corner look for who sponsors it. All one guy. He owns a lot of buildings. He bought most of them from..... one guy, Maurice Gordon. Yes, Gordon St is named after Maurice, right next to 1334 Comm.

You can be on ashmont street but be in totally different neighborhoods.  Personally, I think SE of the station, between Dot ave and Adams street is the perfect spot. You're close enough to the station, but also right by adams village and have easy highway access via gallivan blvd. It's also very safe.  Any specific streets you're looking at?"

I'd say DC has a better rail infrastructure in place but is more expensive and like Boston is prone to breakdowns. Boston has such a diverse transit system (heavy rail, light rail, commuter rail, bus, BRT, even ferry) which makes it incredibly unique and flexible but also incredibly cumbersome."

boston,3d9qlc,syyskuu09,2,Tue Jul 14 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"DC system is the Cadillac in the US-- all new since the 1970s, vs. early 1900s and even late 1800s for parts of the Boston system--and paid for out of federal largesse. Always thought the barrel-vaulted stations were beautiful. I've heard the criticism before that the Metro is more geared to commuters than to local getting around within Washington but not so much lately as so many neighborhoods in the District have rebounded and maybe the new residents use the system more. Interesting that it's so expensive. I guess that's what Gov Baker wants, for the MBTA to set rates a lot higher. Politically hard to do (and unfair) in a city like Boston with so many working class users who can't afford to live in the center and who need access to jobs, etc."
boston,3d9qlc,singalong37,4,Tue Jul 14 23:52:07 2015 UTC,Metro was never supposed to be as used as it was. Even with ridership falling the average weekday now has more ridership than its all-time record had pre-2000. The high cost is to compensate for the lack of commuter rail in the burbs as well.   WMATA can get away with high fares because of this and that the poor people are usually taking Metrobus or the assortment of suburban systems. I will say that systems like Ride On and Fairfax Connector serve those areas better (with Metrobus) than the MBTA does in its burbs or anywhere on a Sunday.

boston,3d9qlc,Lerker-,19,Tue Jul 14 19:05:46 2015 UTC,"NY isn't that bad, the vast majority of the trains are of no consequence to you. The only trick to NY is learning the directions (uptown/downtown).  We don't use them, but for tourists the Inbound/Outbound stuff on the MBTA is awful. Someone could give you directions saying ""take an inbound train,"" but if you get on at a different station the correct train may be Outbound. Like if you get lost and hop on a red @ Park, it's an outbound train, when if you hopped on at DTX it'd still be inbound."

boston,3d9qlc,Replevin4ACow,8,Wed Jul 15 22:35:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  For the size of the city, the public transportation in Boston is great. Most US cities with a population of 650,000 don't have such an elaborate subway system.  We are the 24th largest city in the US and have a subway/rail system that is better than at least 50% of the cities that are larger than us (more like 75%, but this assessment is subjective).    For example, Houston has a population of over 2.2 million people and has a three line rail system that looks like this.  From all accounts I have heard, it sucks -- and Houston is HUGE geographically compared to Boston (see a direct comparison here (from a post I saw a few days ago here in /r/boston )).   If anything, our system more closely resembles LA's system - the second largest city in the country with ~4 million people.  And, again, all accounts I have heard suggest that system sucks.  Just as with Houston, LA is way larger geographically (see the link above for a comparison of size).  I bitch about the T a lot.  But if I step back and think about it without the rage induced by a canceled/late train, I am forever grateful for it."
boston,3d9qlc,suchahotmess,8,Thu Jul 16 02:33:09 2015 UTC,"The one caveat there is that Boston is a smallish city for the transport network that it has because the network stretches across multiple towns.

Our transit covers a lot more than just the city of Boston, and we even have large sections of the city with no real rapid transit access (Roslindale, West Roxbury, Hyde Park).

boston,3d9qlc,hypnozooid,5,Wed Jul 15 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"I love the MBTA. Before I moved to Boston I lived somewhere where the closest public transit was a commuter rail stop a half hour drive away, which only the local trains stopped at, and tickets cost $25 each way because it was all the way out, and it was a two hour ride to get into the city. There weren't any buses or anything, so if you didn't have a car you were completely fucked, and there were just houses, farms, and woods for miles in each direction so you couldn't walk or bike anywhere either. And even that was better than other parts of the country, because at least there was a train station in driving distance.   I can't walk to any subway stations from where I live now, but there are probably at least 15 different buses in a mile radius, and the express ones are great. I can get basically anywhere in the Boston area, and a monthly pass is less than the price of two tanks of gas. Even at 11pm on a weekday, there are routes where you never need to wait more than 10 minutes. I don't have a car now, but even when I did I only used it to go grocery shopping or drive somewhere out of state, because it's so much more convenient (and cheaper, fares don't cover anywhere near the cost) to take public transit everywhere.   Also, it's reliable, there's the real time tracking, and even if there was a nuclear attack and the whole system shut down Boston is really easily walkable."

I can tell you that 99% of the time when there is a delay on the Orange Line it has to do with a police action, medical emergency or someone jumping on the tracks. Sometimes there's a disabled train, but those delays tend to be minor and don't happen that often."
boston,3d9qlc,HitTheGrit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:48:56 2015 UTC,"That's pretty close to my daily commute (Griggs St - Quincy Adams), and it typically takes me closer to an hour and 20 minutes by T or 25 minutes (without traffic) by car. Also it's more like 16 miles.  I have noticed since I recently started driving again that it seems like everyone is driving much slower than they did 7 years ago, when I was last driving regularly. Or my speedometer might be broken."

While a lot of stuff sucked last winter, I am pretty freakin' amazed that the bus route I take to work was actually pretty much on time, all of the time. That's especially amazing because much of the route is through hilly and  narrow (even sans snow banks) residential streets."

boston,3d9qlc,ArtisanalCollabo,-3,Wed Jul 15 14:28:28 2015 UTC,You could easily tell who the transplants on Reddit were because after the winter all they did was whine and shit on the T for absolutely everything and claim it as the worst transit system. I've used it all my life and even with the winter I can't really complain all that much.   For such a small city the fact that we have accessible transit that's always nearby is something even us lifers take for granted sometimes.
boston,3d9qlc,usfunca,7,Wed Jul 15 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"Boston isn't ""such a small city.""  It's the 10th largest metro in the country (6th if you go by CSA).  And, lifers are usually the first people to take parts of their city for granted."
boston,3d9qlc,ArtisanalCollabo,4,Tue Jul 14 20:24:10 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the city itself and compared to other major cities it is a much more concentrated area of business and residential.  They don't call here an extremely walkable city for nothing, and it's a joy that we have the transit system we do on top of it."
boston,3d9qlc,usfunca,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"Understood.  For what it's worth, a large part of what makes Boston an extremely walkable city is the transit system.  Without the transit system it would not be nearly as walkable as it is."

boston,3d9qlc,nickellis14,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can walk from Brighton to the harbor in like an hour and a half at most. It's the small size that makes it walkable. The T helps, but the small geographic area is an enormous part of it."

No one aside from you has seen that happen with anything approaching what one could call frequency. And I've literally not been on one orange line train that the AC didn't work on. And again, I ride it every day.  So you literally made up 3 things so you could bitch about the orange line.  I'm not angry. I just find it comical that some self entitled jackass has taken it upon him/herself to make up things to complain about. (that would be you, for the record)  Check your downvotes homie.

boston,3da4jk,Dicentra22,9,Tue Jul 14 20:23:00 2015 UTC,"Gills are only designed to work in one direction.  When you go shark fishing for Mako or Thresher or Porbeagale, one of the first things you do when you bring it beside the boat is have a noose ready to get around their tail fin to then drag it backwards and drown it. Otherwise you'd have to ""gill it"" (stab it in the gills and kill it) or shoot it. Kinves and guns aren't wise things to be fucking with on a rocking boat with a shark that doesn NOT want to be caught, so the usual procedure is to drown by dragging it backwards."

boston,3da4jk,Likonium,4,Tue Jul 14 21:00:31 2015 UTC,Is that shark ok? I don't see it moving around a lot when they get it back in the water and what are they doing to the shark at the 3 min marker?
boston,3da4jk,timobriggs,13,Wed Jul 15 20:15:28 2015 UTC,It's okay.  /u/Blanketsburg posted this below  Or possibly above.  We'll just go with elsewhere.
boston,3da4jk,problematic4tw,2,Tue Jul 14 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised they went with a dragging method. They should've had several people digging a ditch, filling with water from the outside that would allow them to shove the shark back in. Kind of curious how the shark got that far in though."
boston,3da4jk,timobriggs,7,Tue Jul 14 21:01:21 2015 UTC,"If that shark hadn't been dragged, it probably would have ""drowned"" or more accurately, suffocated. Great whites, as someone else mentioned, are ram ventilators that require forward movement to pass water over their gills. Without this forward movement, the water around the gills quickly becomes a dead zone with low oxygen levels. By dragging it, they were helping to get this shark more oxygen than it was receiving in low circulating water when it was stuck on the shore.   Even as they drag it, the shark is still nigh on comatose due to how little oxygen it has. It is only after a while of dragging and manipulation of the gill flaps that the shark is able to swim on its own power.  Whales and dolphins usually can be pushed out because they are deriving oxygen from the air, not the water, so they don't suffocate in the same way that this shark was."
boston,3da4jk,thebruns,2,Tue Jul 14 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they meant dragging it along the sand, instead of digging a ditch to flood it with water that led back into the ocean."

boston,3dg80i,pausemenu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:52:52 2015 UTC,"You are correct you are ending one type of agreement and haven't started the at will part. An at will agreement means there is no writing. You pay on the first of each month until one of the parties gives 30 notice. Your lease ends on the 31st. The renewal clause in the lease is for renewal of the lease most likely, because you didn't give notice to renew you now default to ""at will"" which really means month to month. So the question is can you leave on the 31st and not be obligated to pay on August 1st?   That's a tough one Technically you are released from the lease on the 31st and the way you start another tenancy (the at will one) would by be to pay on August 1st. Technically you don't need to and can move out. I can't see any legal recourse the LL would have because he/she never bothered to ask you to renew. Which they should have for security. It's not the right thing to do you would be leaving your LL in hot water. I would talk to them and just give them a heads up. Is there a reason you didn't notify the land lord Of the new lease sooner?   Tldr: your lease ends at the end of July, you only start the at will tenancy if and when you pay on August 1st."

boston,3dg80i,cpxh,0,Thu Jul 16 01:01:28 2015 UTC,"Very important question here:  Did you at any time give written or verbal confirmation or even an indication that you would be remaining in your current place beyond your current least term?   If no, then you have no legal obligation to stay or pay.* I would, out of kindness, still inform your LL that you intend to move out when the lease is up. But because you have not entered into a tenancy at will, nor have you given any indication of your intention to enter into that agreement, it can be assumed that you will vacate the property at the end of your lease.  If yes, then you might be in a sticky situation because even verbal agreements are binding.    I would highly highly recommend you talk to your landlord ASAP. That is the best option for you and your LL.   *If your landlord has not accepted a rent check from you which clearly specifies it is for occupancy, and you do not have a written or oral agreement, then you are not a tenant at will, and this can swing both ways. You can be kicked out, or you can leave.   This is not intended to be legal advice. Consult a lawyer and never trust strangers on the internet.  Some good information Here, and Here"
boston,3dg80i,cpxh,2,Thu Jul 16 12:51:40 2015 UTC,"No communication prior to today.  I spoke to the LL today, he seemed perfectly OK with finding a suitor for the 1st.

boston,3dgh2b,Ruddose,4,Thu Jul 16 02:08:22 2015 UTC,"Its RCN or Comcast, and most places in Brighton don't have RCN.  The entire Allston/Brighton area is crawling with Comcast reps starting in August. The last few years they have been pushing a 79.99/mo deal that includes blast internet, digital starter cable and hbo. It's a pretty good deal.  I own a modem and router and just do the install myself so I don't need a tech to visit and I've been up and running the same day each time I've moved. One benefit of getting the plan through on of the reps on the street is that if the previous tenant forgets to cancel, you can call them up and they can cancel it - normally you'd need to wait for a tech visit for this."
boston,3dgh2b,datwrasse,3,Thu Jul 16 02:53:07 2015 UTC,"There is a good chance the house is already wired by the previous tenant, and you only need to connect the equipment (especially if you are going to use the same provider as the previous tenant - if you are in RCN service area, I suggest choosing RCN over Comcast). In that case you can bring your own modem and router, and the only thing you'll have to do is to connect them together and to the wall, and read the modem's address to their customer service over the phone. The service could potentially be up the same day.  You also won't have to pay for rental of equipment, so buying your own pays for itself within a year and gives you greater control.  I might be selling my modem and router before moving, they were used without issues with both RCN and Comcast. PM me if that interests you.

Call them soon bc the whole city moves on 9/1, the sooner you call the better your chances of getting an install appointment on or close to 9/1.  Process is easy, choose your cable/internet package. They give you a 4 hour time window for install and someone shows up and sets everything up. Leverage the fact that Comcast is also available in your area and get them to waive any installation fees and get them to give you free HBO or showtime for a few months. Basically play hard to get until they stop offering you free or discounted shit."

You can people watch , take a walk around , relax and get some sun. When you get to hot you could go to get some ice cream.  If you get bored roll down the hill with the kids, watch  people catch fish out back. Or hop on the highway and head to Marshfield and go to Rexhame beach. It's not to far at all. It has a snack shack , bathrooms and good parking. Just some ideas - I'm sure you'll be sun burnt in no time . Good luck."
boston,3degk9,JAMIETHUMB,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:26:49 2015 UTC,"Strongly recommend Good Harbor Beach in Gloucester - it's a FUN place and is my favorite beach here. Shallow surf, white sand, snack bar / restrooms, lots of parking ($25 tho and arrive before noon), an island that has a sand bar leading to it at low tide, a creek through the beach on the other side. It's like a playground for kids and adults!"

boston,3degb9,AnthonyD1987,7,Wed Jul 15 17:08:07 2015 UTC,"Two options come to mind, but they're both cities, because of the density of ""fun things."" If you're dead set on the Cape, I've had plenty of fun getting a cheap motel on 28 in Yarmouth, Town and Country is one, and simply using it as a jumping-off point to explore. It doesn't matter it's just a super basic room, you won't be doing anything except sleeping...and uhh whatever else you want....in it. But, if you're open to other options.   1) Providence. Take the train (Amtrak is a nice option for only like $5 more than commuter rail), or easy drive. Stay HERE, it's cheap, it's right downtown, it has neat bars and restaurants, and a coffee shop in the ground floor. Drink cool cocktails at The Dorrance, walk around the East Side, especially Benefit Street to see lots of cool architecture. Go to the RISD museum (free on Sundays) which is world-class for such a small city. Take her to a nice dinner either on Federal Hill, for Italian (Andino's, Siena, etc.), or try Rosalina downtown.  2) Portland. I've done this for a weekend, and while I'm less familiar with the city than Boston or Providence, I had a great time. Walk around Old Port, do a brewery tour at Allagash or Shipyard. Drive to a beach. Repeat."

Now there is a main stage, a catwalk, and a smaller stage.  I think it had to do with tickets being sold prior to U2 finalizing the actual stage setup.  I'd blame Ticketmaster/Live Nation (and probably U2 management) for the ambiguous initial setup.  This happened with all of the venues, not just at the Garden.  I don't want to give anything away, but I did go to the show on Saturday, and its pretty awesome!  Probably not a bad seat in the house, unless you are directly behind the main stage.  However, if you are unhappy with your seats, I would speak to someone when you get to the Garden, and I am sure they will help you out.  I've been moved/upgraded when the sound in my section sucked.

boston,3ddk5w,StrongoFYB,-11,Wed Jul 15 13:04:47 2015 UTC,"I am guessing, the point is - why is a spotter needed? You'd think there would be enough training included for a conductor to handle this."
boston,3ddk5w,rtuck06,7,Wed Jul 15 13:08:10 2015 UTC,"why is a spotter needed? You'd think there would be enough training included for a conductor to handle this.   Rapid transit in Boston has mostly been grandfathered through various Nation Transportation Safety Board policy reforms. That means that the MBTA can use unapproved tech and safety procedures, but it also means the MBTA has to be extraspecial careful in their safety protocols - a few slip-ups in and the NTSB will swoop in an demand an expensive upgrade. They're already breathing down the MBTA's neck about PTC after the Green Line collisions - so they can't afford a stupid mistake like not having an inspector to help on an over-shot platform. Do they actually need it? Nah, not really, but they make it easy for the conductor and they cover the MBTA on the liability side of things."
boston,3ddk5w,CantabKBH,10,Wed Jul 15 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"Safety reasons, they are following procedure. They need to be 100% sure the train is clear before moving. This happens every once in a while, not a big deal. So it's actually them using their training."
boston,3ddk5w,Baron_Von_D,-6,Wed Jul 15 13:18:13 2015 UTC,"Clear as in ""nothing behind it"" or clear as in people somehow in the way? I am mean I am not trying to be overly argumentative here, but this seems like the type of redundant crap leading to the delays we all love."
boston,3ddk5w,rtuck06,5,Wed Jul 15 13:20:43 2015 UTC,"Safety protocols are there for a reason. They are ensuring nothing will obstruct the train and nobody is behind the train or will be harmed by the train while it is backing up. Also, noting several fatalities in the past year from people falling onto the tracks. It's ok to have extra precaution. It would be a much larger delay if anything happened during it backing up. Probably takes less time then ding-dongs who hold the doors or stand in the door trying to push into the train when there is obviously no more space. That is what absolutely causes more delays at each stop."
boston,3ddk5w,Baron_Von_D,5,Wed Jul 15 13:29:43 2015 UTC,I've been on trains that overshot tons of times and they usually back up immediately. Maybe there's usually an employee on the platform as spotter and I've just been one of the lucky ones to have it corrected on the spot? Or maybe sometimes the drivers don't care and do it anyway.
boston,3ddk5w,DefiantLoveLetter,6,Wed Jul 15 13:50:56 2015 UTC,"Where I work you can't even back a truck up without somebody spotting you if there is more than one person around. This is one of the first things instilled in you in any job involving large equipment, most mistakes occur when backing up so this is just an added layer of safety for everyone involved."
boston,3ddk5w,hvdc123,4,Wed Jul 15 14:46:07 2015 UTC,"Because mistakes happen? I've never driven a train, but I imagine there's a level of difficulty involved.

That being said, i'd reccomend Boston Chops in the South End.  First of all, it's the best steak I've ever had.  Second of all, they offer 8oz varieties of their Hanger, Flat Iron, and Skirt Steaks for $25. Comes with a choice of sauce (Bearnaise, Bourdelaise, House, Chimmichurri Butter, Peppercorn, and BBQ), seasonal greens, and ""generous frites' ....which means every time a new batch of fries is up in the fryer, a cook comes out with them piping hot, tosses them with seasoning and salt, and walks through the dining room topping people off.  It's not dry-aged but they're Prime, and cooked to perfection, and lets face it, 8oz is still a half a pound and this is going to be unreal quality.  Grab a , their Bone Marrow Appetizer and maybe a side and you can get out of there for for an arm instead of an arm and a leg, eating food that blows most steakhouses out of the water (depending on how much you're drinking as well).  Their Exec Chef Chris Coombs is an awesome guy and rated one of the top 30 Chefs Under 30. Ate their once and Abe & Louies, Smith & Wollensky's, Del Frisco's, Capital Grille, etc just don't compare anymore."

boston,3db0z8,LinkNeverFucksZelda,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"Agree.  It's absolutely a steakhouse and I wouldn't call it as ""spun"" or ""re-imagined"" but it is slightly more ""updated"" decor than the usual suspects, which lean on the whole ""dark wood and red leather booth"" traditional steak house types.  And in spite of the more ""modern"" decor, I love that they still have the ""rarely celebrated"" organ meat options like Marrow, Oxtail, Tongue, Cheeks, and Heart.  Had a bad experience at Grill 23 and haven't been back, which isn't fair of me because it was my tramp of an ex-gf who kinda ruined it, but have been meaning to return with an open mind and check out Bogie's Place as well."

I suspect from your comment about sauces that you are no fan of Del Friscos, so at least we have that in common. Mooo is a fantastic place, it is just more of a fine dining restaurant than a steak house.  Makes sense because it took over the space from the Federalist.  Abe & Louie's has gone down hill, so I haven't been back in awhile.  I was thinking of giving it another chance.  So that's fair - it definitely at least used to be at the top.  But S&Ws?  No way - that place is terrible compared to the others, and the one in the financial district is useless if it weren't for the outdoor bar in the summer time."
boston,3db0z8,LinkNeverFucksZelda,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"S&W isn't great in terms of ""a nice place to eat"" but they do know their steak really well. It's probably true that their cuts are a lower grade than G23, but if you just need a damn good steak at a reasonable price they've always come through for me.  I feel like G23 has gotten wayyy too careless with their style, overthinking steak quite a bit. The last time I went there I basically got a steak with something I can only describe as craft heinz ketchup on it. Damn near sent it back but I was there on a business dinner.  Haven't been to del frisco's, no. Haven't been to A&L in a few years, not terribly surprised they've gone downhill. This thread makes me want to try Boston Chops tho. And I do miss KOPrime...   Honestly, my favorite reasonably-priced steak for a bit was over at Rendevous, but they've since closed. That place had incredible food and cocktails and I miss them immensely.   Saloon has also on occasion had some pretty excellent slabs of meat, their bourbon list is icing on that cake."

boston,3dbwjo,Phylundite,5,Wed Jul 15 01:52:56 2015 UTC,"I would get dropped off at Faneuil Hall, walk around there for a bit, see some of the history, then head down the Greenway and over the Fort Point Channel to the Waterfront for an early lunch. If it's a nice day there will be tons of people out, you can walk right alongside the Harbor, which is beautiful, and also see the federal courthouse where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Whitey Bulger were prosecuted. There are a ton of restaurants with outdoor seating and water views in that area. You can easily get on I-93 to head north from that spot, too."
boston,3dbwjo,j2e21,6,Wed Jul 15 13:17:21 2015 UTC,"Get dropped off at Fanueil Hall and walk around there and the waterfront for a short bit, and then follow the Freedom Trail 'backwards' towards Boston Common. Stroll around the Common and the Public Garden. You can walk down Newbury Street and do a quick bit of shopping, and continue  to Fenway Park. You could probably do a tour of the park if you wanted, but it's pretty cool to see if you don't go in anyway.  There are tons of restaurants and bars at every step along the way on this route, so do a small amount of research beforehand so you have a few options (depending on how hungry you are and what you want to spend).  If this sounds like too much walking, there are a bunch of Hubway bicycles scattered about the city so you could save your feet for a little and rent one.  Just my 2 cents. Good luck and have fun!"

boston,3dd2aj,Humbucker,3,Wed Jul 15 11:18:21 2015 UTC,"I would guess as a Med graduate you be on Tufts Med Center campus in downtown, which is just off the Orange line of the Subway.

boston,3dd2aj,eladts,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:34:32 2015 UTC,You're not going to be driving anywhere near Tufts Medical if your budget is $1k a month.
boston,3dd2aj,mother_of_g-d,0,Wed Jul 15 14:16:32 2015 UTC,Look into the Somerville area if you're going to Tufts. Tufts is the borderline between Medford and Somerville but Somerville is on the cheaper side. There are buses that run up and down from Somerville to Tufts and vice versa. If you can't find anything right away there is a campus bulletin that people also going to Tufts use to look for roommates/flatmates. Best of luck.

boston,3dcpzk,Jsm1370,2,Wed Jul 15 11:40:22 2015 UTC,"Was recently in Minneapolis, with that offer, as long as you can survive the cold, I'd stay there. There are differences between Boston and your current city but Boston doesn't have anything worth taking a pay cut at that level over your current situation.  I now actually consider Minneapolis/St.P to be a pretty good Midwest Boston alternative."
boston,3dcpzk,theg2,2,Wed Jul 15 12:17:45 2015 UTC,"One of the things I'm most concerned about is that I don't feel poor in St. Paul and I am happy here, so I'm hesitant to change that. The job in Boston could set me up well long-term, but the next one to two years could be rough getting there. Staying in St. Paul, I currently have a job and can keep looking for the next opportunity here.  Thank you for your comment! It's really helpful and gives me the sorts of things I'm looking for as I think through all the scenarios!"
boston,3dcpzk,DildoGaggings,4,Wed Jul 15 12:30:57 2015 UTC,What keeps me here is  a lack of a car to drive/move down south and a laziness. Also that 38k drops to like 28k maybe after taxes and stuff. Don't forget your bills included.  You will be fine if you don't blow cash on dumb stuff.
boston,3dcpzk,aaronsweber,5,Wed Jul 15 09:41:39 2015 UTC,It's possible and reasonable.  Note however that Matt Yglesias says young ambitious people should move to Minneapolis because it is the best bargain of any American city.
boston,3dcpzk,vhalros,2,Wed Jul 15 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"Try Malden/Medford, maybe Arlington. The job market is pretty good, but I don't know how it compares to MN. Depends. Financially, it probably doesn't make any sense. Unless the new job offers better opportunity for advancement, or you think living here offers more employers and thus more opportunity to advance by switching.  I like the density, the walk-ability, the bike ability, that fact that different neighborhoods feel different. Of course, Minniapolis/St. Paul is probably more bikeable than here, although our winters are considerably more mild.   There is also a lot going on. If you are interested in something, some one here is doing it.  And if you have certain specialties, very high paying jobs are available.   You can live pretty comfortably on 39,800 here; I did it with much less than that as a graduate student and still saved 20% of my income. You will have to avoid eating out all the time and wasting money on crap. It would take a long time to buy a house though. With two of you it would be a bit tight until your partner gets a job. It would be hard if you have kids.  St. Paul/Minneapolis is a pretty good place too, so it depends a lot on how much you like it there, and if you want to move somewhere different."
boston,3dcpzk,Hansel555,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:48:18 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your thoughts! Fortunately no kids. I do think the job could lead to some pretty great (and higher paying) opportunities later, but fully agree that it would be tight until my partner gets a job."
boston,3dcpzk,nuotnik,2,Wed Jul 15 12:45:41 2015 UTC,"My wife and I make way more than that and are likely going to move to MSP, primarily due to cost of living concerns. But we're looking at buying, not renting, and are likely in general in a different phase of life from you and your partner. Good luck!"
boston,3dcpzk,fatvoodoo,2,Wed Jul 15 12:46:41 2015 UTC,Thank you for your input! I'll definitely put in a plug for MSP. I love where I live and the cost of living here. Good luck to you as well!
boston,3dcpzk,cjdubs66,2,Wed Jul 15 12:50:35 2015 UTC,"If you want to save on rent, live with other people. 1 bedroom apartments and studios carry a decent premium. If you are willing to share a kitchen/laundry facilities/living room/bath room with others, it is a good way to pay less. I live in a small room in a fairly nice 3 bedroom apartment in a very desireable location, and I pay $680/month for rent."
boston,3dcpzk,cpxh,2,Wed Jul 15 13:17:22 2015 UTC,"I would do the move, the job market is definitely stronger here than in MN and will continue to grow (as predicted by virtually all economists).  Your partner will have no trouble finding work in customer service, and if you both like it here you can look into buying a place while the interest rates are still low.  St. Paul is a great place to live, but I do feel Boston has ""more"" of everything and you should be quite happy with the decision.  For instance, outside of the twin cities there isn't too much going on, but around the greater Boston area there are so many different communities, each with it's own personality, you can find the right niche for you both."
boston,3dcpzk,WillMakeYouCryaLot,2,Wed Jul 15 13:22:41 2015 UTC,It's still possible to rent under 1500. You won't be staying in a palace by any means. I was renting in east boston a. Two bedroom for 1250 with heat and hot water included. It was only a ten minute walk to the t and commuting was a breeze. The neighborhood we were in was nice but walking to the t at night could be a little sketchy. If your so works in restaurants there's a million jobs in town for that right now. There's a new restaurant opening every week and the demand for competent help is the highest I've seen since I started in the industry. The city is a blast but not without its flaws for sure. Sounds like you're already used to rough winters though coming from where you are.
boston,3dcpzk,eyeblinkfast-lo,3,Thu Jul 16 14:35:43 2015 UTC,"Is there any way I pay less than $1500 a month for rent while still being able to commute to Cambridge? I have a lovely kitty that would need to move as well.   This is doable if you live somewhere withing bussing distance to Cambridge. You can find 1br places in Watertown or Newton for $1k per month.  Cats are typically ok. Dog friendly places are harder to find.    How is the job market here? My partner has a lot of customer service experience in restaurants, grocery stores, and hotels. He also has one IT certification, and is currently working on another, but doesn't have any formal IT experience.   Plenty of opportunities in customer service, less so in IT but if he keeps looking eventually he'll find something.    Am I totally crazy to think of accepting a job that is essentially a pay cut due to cost of living?   Not really. It depends on what YOU want.    Natives and transplants alike: what keeps you or drew you here? What would I be missing out on by not moving?   Long time native, I traveled the world but came back to MA because I love the seasons, the access to everything from skiing to beaches, to world class entertainment, and you know the best decade of sports ever."
boston,3dcpzk,WillMakeYouCryaLot,2,Wed Jul 15 16:54:07 2015 UTC,I live in Malden ten minutes walking to a station paying 1000 a month for a 1 be and pay 75 a month for transportation to my job in Camb. I think you'll be fine.
boston,3dcpzk,puddlepuncher,2,Wed Jul 15 06:34:31 2015 UTC,That commute would be killer though by public transportation.   OP: job market is good. I moved here and it's a great place. Summer is awesome. Lots of stuff to do.  Now I have a kid and there is still lots of stuff for us to do.
boston,3dcpzk,2bABee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:53:47 2015 UTC,This is encouraging! We could do 1000 or even a little more if I could find something like that. I'll look at Malden.
boston,3dcpzk,Saaahrentino,3,Wed Jul 15 12:34:44 2015 UTC,Medford too. Alpha Management is a pretty shitty company but the apartments are pretty good and the cheapest you'll find in the city. Speaking from my own experience.
boston,3dcpzk,StrongoFYB,3,Wed Jul 15 13:38:57 2015 UTC,You're definitely not gonna find anything for $1000.
boston,3dcpzk,cosinezero,2,Wed Jul 15 14:59:48 2015 UTC,"That isn't very much to live on, but if you are willing to commute awhile or use the bus instead of the subway it would be more doable.   Look at living in Watertown or one of the other inner 'burbs. Rents in the core are far less livable.  Plus prices are skyrocketing even in the 'burb's now. Is that 39 K going to escalate very quickly? It better, because you can expect prices to go up 50% in another few years.  Personally I'm thinking of leaving and if you are happy in St.Paul you should probably stay there. Boston is rapidly becoming another SF where you're either filthy rich or dirt poor."
boston,3dcpzk,pkmnnerdfighter,2,Wed Jul 15 14:08:44 2015 UTC,"What you may pay more for in cost of living you will make up in quality of life. Boston is a cultural epicenter with tons and tons to do. I don't know a lot about St. Paul but would venture to say there's more to see, do, and experience here in Boston. Seafood options alone should motivate you to consider living here! u/WillMakeYouCryaLot is correct that if you don't insist upon living in the trendy/gentrified areas it's generally not stupid expensive. Even where I am in Dorchester is pretty cheap. Look for apartments that are owned (but not necessarily occupied) by the owner. That's usually the best way to avoid never ending rent increases that result in having to move every single summer."
boston,3dcpzk,1noahone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:38:15 2015 UTC,"dorchester is pretty much stupid-expensive, whether zillow/redfin $/Sqft metrics, or a 3br on CL, compared to similarly-hoodish-with-occasional-gay-yuppie-pocket areas with similar numbers of bodegas and pho restos and shootings and all-night fireworks like Lawrence, Lowell, Lynn, Chelsea, Providence except the East-Side, Springfield, Brockton, Fall River, New Bedford, Worcester. to the tune of 2-3x as expensive. you have to really want to live near the rest of boston to pay that kind of premium?"

However... you don't list your own future goals.   You might find yourself feeling poor here.

boston,3dcpzk,1noahone,-3,Wed Jul 15 09:50:41 2015 UTC,Brighton (Oak Square) is central and reasonable. I'm paying $850 for a nice 2 bed apartment.

boston,3dcpzk,1noahone,4,Wed Jul 15 10:51:28 2015 UTC,Yeah there's really nothing under $1000 in that area and that's for a 1br. Unless you get a sweet hookup it's going to be at least a grand.

There's always so many free cultural festivals and events to check out, and yes it gets hot but not nearly as stupid hot at Memphis!   I took summer classes at Tufts last summer and definitely don't regret it (I do regret taking O Chem however, but I digress lol). Now let's not talk about winter, I try to suppress those bleak memories...please don't go up there during January-March lol but you saw Boston at a great time, even Boston's fall is absolutely gorgeous. Can't wait to go back up there for my internship in August, although I'm having a kickass time in Memphis right now too :)   As for the niceness of the people, I'm generally a person that keeps to myself and not super social so I like how Bostonians tend to move quickly and shorten small talk. A very Southern person filled with that good ol' Soutern hospitality might find them rude though...but one thing I've noticed about Bostonians is that they do look out for each other when the going gets tough (i.e two month-long blizzards), the place has some seriously spirit/pride!

boston,3d747c,vitaminq,19,Tue Jul 14 01:12:34 2015 UTC,I think this is one benefit to people being so attached to Fenway Park as an institution.
boston,3d747c,amfarrell,5,Tue Jul 14 02:20:14 2015 UTC,Fenway Park is also privately owned and financed
boston,3d747c,spedmunki,4,Tue Jul 14 14:48:29 2015 UTC,"That it's not ""Fenway Park at Dunkin Donuts Field brought to you by Sam Adams?"""
boston,3d747c,itsonlyastrongbuzz,4,Tue Jul 14 12:39:33 2015 UTC,"The name ""Fenway Park"" was in fact a corporate name. At the time, the Fenway area was very much up-and-coming. The fens had essentially been a swamp up until the 1890s when the area was dredged and Muddy River was reshaped as part of Olmstead's Emerald Necklace.  In 1911, John Taylor - the then-owner of the Red Sox and a real estate mogul - purchased land for a new stadium in an area then known as the Back Bay Fens. The name ""Fenway"" was only used in reference to the road that happened to go through the fens - similar to the way we now use Jamaica Way. So why choose the name ""Fenway"" for the park?  Well, for one, it fit within the naming scheme people were used to - the Huntington Avenue Grounds that preceded Fenway were also named after a road. But far more importantly, it was named Fenway Park because Taylor also happened to be the owner of the Fenway Realty Company.   I believe they call that synergy in today's corporate-speak."
boston,3d747c,Mattseee,0,Tue Jul 14 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"It's really not a corporate name if the corporation was named after the area/park/neighborhood.  The Arborway was the tree-lined boulevard that bordered the Emerald Necklace from the Arboretum to Franklin Park.  The Jamaicaway was the tree-lined boulevard that bordered the Emerald Necklace and Jamaica Plain to the Jamaica Pond where it became the Arborway.  The Riverway was the tree-lined boulevard that bordered the Emerald Necklace and Muddy River to Route 9 / Huntington Ave where it became the Jamaicaway.  The Fenway was the tree lined boulevard that bordered the Emrald Necklace and Back Bay Fens to the Muddy River where it became the Riverway.  You're saying it's a corporate name because its owner also owned the Fenway Realty Company, the corporate name of the realty company was only that because of where it existed... But I don't think that's unique enough to consider it in the same category as PETCO Park."
boston,3d747c,itsonlyastrongbuzz,2,Tue Jul 14 18:28:11 2015 UTC,"Asked at one point what the name of the new ballpark would be, John I. Taylor reportedly said, “It’s in the Fenway, isn’t it? Call it Fenway Park.” That he and his father owned the Fenway Realty Company and saw some benefit in helping develop the area around the new ballpark may not have been coincidental. In fact, they’d sold most of their interest in the Red Sox in 1911 and real estate became a major interest (along with the family-owned Boston Globe newspaper.)   From the Society for American Baseball Research"
boston,3d747c,Mattseee,0,Tue Jul 14 19:08:51 2015 UTC,"“It’s in the Fenway, isn’t it? Call it Fenway Park.”   Right.  And Madison Square Garden is in Madison Square.  I'm not seeing where the corporate speak is coming in."
boston,3d747c,itsonlyastrongbuzz,3,Tue Jul 14 19:12:48 2015 UTC,I'm not disagreeing with you. The fact that it was named after the area and the fact that the people who named it did so to further popularize the area in order to increase business are not mutually exclusive.  You could also say that Wrigley Field was named after the Wrigley family that owned the Cubs. That it also happened to further their chewing gum brand wasn't a coincidence.

boston,3d747c,AdamInJP,12,Tue Jul 14 12:17:47 2015 UTC,Kraft paid for that stadium and the surrounding mall/hotel etc. in full. All the state contributed was transportation infrastructure. So...not really a good comparison.
boston,3d747c,nickellis14,5,Tue Jul 14 12:31:38 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. My point was ""stuff near a stadium can work"", not ""the taxpayers should pay for a stadium because of the stuff near it"".  I would expect, having been a Revs fan for 20 years, that if Kraft manages to get a stadium deal on Frontage Road as many of us think he will, that the stadium won't live in a vacuum. He'd build some elements there that are similar to what he did in Foxboro. Obviously he won't have the acreage available to make a second Patriot Place, but I seriously doubt he'd do a stand-alone stadium and nothing else.  And even if the state didn't contribute much to the building of Patriot Place, they do benefit from its existence - the ticket prices for the trains run to Gillette for Patriots games, sales taxes on all of the retail outlets in the strip mall, taxes on the meals served at the restaurants, etc. The state in many (not all) cases should want a stadium to be built, but only under particular conditions, including very limited public contribution. Personally I'm fine with a sweetheart deal on land for a stadium. I'm not fine with public funding of stadium costs."
boston,3d747c,AdamInJP,6,Tue Jul 14 15:11:02 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that Mr. Kraft had a lot more land to work with in Foxboro than he will in Boston, and the authorities in Foxboro were undoubtedly more friendly to whatever it was he wanted to do than the BRA will be.  I'm not arguing that the state doesn't benefit from Patriot Place. It does. Enormously. But had the state paid for the stadium, AND the infrastructure improvements, the payback period on that expenditure would likely exceed the useful life of the stadium.  I think we are making the same argument here, but it was unclear in your previous comment that this was the argument you were making.  If the Boston Olympics can somehow convince Kraft (and the city to allow Kraft) to foot the bill to build a soccer stadium here with his own money that would temporarily be used for the Olympics, I can't imagine there would be a whole lot of public opposition. Any public opposition would be coming from people who don't know what the fuck they're talking about..."
boston,3d747c,nickellis14,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:28:14 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't happen - the whole point of a soccer stadium is that it'd seat way less than the Olympics would want it to. Revs need a stadium with ~25K capacity. Olympics would want north of 60K. And while I'm sure it's possible to build a 25K permanent stadium that can be temporarily expanded to 60K, it seems unwise.  I actually think Kraft is working against the Olympics here (and for that, I thank him). If he hitches his wagon to the Olympics, the Revs don't get a stadium for almost another decade. And the media message around a Revs stadium is increasingly toxic; he can't afford 8 more years of that.  But yes, I think we generally agree that public financing of stadium building is bad."
boston,3d747c,AdamInJP,2,Tue Jul 14 15:35:25 2015 UTC,"And while I'm sure it's possible to build a 25K permanent stadium that can be temporarily expanded to 60K, it seems unwise.   Why?   If he hitches his wagon to the Olympics, the Revs don't get a stadium for almost another decade.   Why not?  Seriously. Do you have any back up for these two assertions?"
boston,3d747c,nickellis14,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:54:56 2015 UTC,"Neither are necessarily factual assertions, just my gut after watching the Revs struggle to find and lock down a stadium site for more than ten years.  If you're designing a facility to be expanded to 60K from a ""stadium base"" of 25K, then the base is going to have to be fairly simple. The only way you get from 25K to 60K is by going up (you can add another bowl on the outside, but it still has to be vertically taller than the inner bowl), which means that the native design of the 25K has to allow for vertical growth. Which in turn means that the stadium can't have many of the traditional features associated with other stadia of the intended size (25K). Which in turn implies that the stadium base isn't going to be on the aesthetic and amenity level that Kraft would probably want.  As to the Olympics, my experience watching Bob Kraft own this team over the last 20 years is that he doesn't do things by halves. Even when his ownership style of the team has been questionable, he sticks with a particular philosophy until convinced of a better alternative. If he's got a deadline of, say, 2023 to have the stadium built and ready to seat 60K, he's not going to pour concrete for the 25K in 2017 and then just sit on his thumbs until its time to make it Olympian. He'll wait until 2022 to break ground, build directly to the 60K, and tear down all but the Revs' version afterward. Which gives the Revs their own stadium in Boston around 2025.  Again, just my gut on this. I have nothing concrete suggesting these are fact, but it's where the thought experiment leads me."
boston,3d747c,AdamInJP,0,Tue Jul 14 19:58:05 2015 UTC,"I don't have a source on this but a combined revs/Olympic stadium (with temporary seating for 60k, lowered down to ~25k after the Olympics) has been one of the ideas to come out of the olympic planning stages. it was presented as a completely doable project. engineers are fucking smart, just because we might struggle to imagine it, doesn't mean it isn't possible."
boston,3d747c,CougarForLife,-1,Tue Jul 14 21:22:26 2015 UTC,"...that whole second paragraph is nonsensical. You can certainly build a 25k seat stadium with luxury boxes that could be expanded to include additional seating above. And the aesthetics of the permanent stadium can be whatever you want them to be. I really don't understand where any of this supposition is coming from. To make a 25k seat stadium into a 60k seat stadium you're essentially just putting a big shell around the permanent stadium. There's nothing that says that permanent stadium can't be whatever the hell you want it to be.  The third paragraph is even more nonsensical. If Kraft wants a stadium in the city, and he gets the approval to build one with the contingency to have it temporarily expanded, he'd immediately get a design for the permanent and expanded stadium in hand and start building the permanent one, with the understanding that the expanded stadium portion would start being built, say, in 2022, with the help of additional money raised by Boston 2024. Why the hell would he sit on his hands for 7 or 8 years? The whole idea of putting a stadium downtown is that he could attract more fans and make more money. Also, much as I hate to say it, he may not even be alive for another 7 or 8 years.  So again, these assertions don't really make a lot of sense."

He sort of machine-gun listed a bunch of cities and sports but he got at least one thing wrong right off the bat: Detroit's new hockey arena. I'm from there and just recently moved out here, and I'm a huge hockey fan cough fuck the Bruins go Wings.  Mike Illich has made billions off of the people in the Michigan, and for some reason he sometimes gets villified for stuff like this but I have no clue why. He's doing his best to revitalize an absolutely devastated city and if he's growing his (wildly popular) sports franchise while he does I don't care. The ""arena"" isn't an arena. It's a gigantic complex that includes lots of retail space, nice apartments, and a grocery store (something Detroit needs more of), as well as parking and oh yeah a hockey arena that's packed most nights of the week from Oct through April.   ""But what about all the communities and people living around it?? What will they do??"". There isn't anyone around it. It's mostly an area of empty lots cleared of blight, a stone's throw from the city center which is revitalizing in ways my parents' generation didn't think was possible.   Does it sound ridiculous for the city to give a couple hundred million to a billionaire right smack dab in the middle of the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history? Of course it does.

boston,3d41kv,HistoryMonkey,12,Tue Jul 14 21:35:37 2015 UTC,There is actually a great app for the NYC subway that does exactly what OP did for the Red Line. It's called Exit Strategy. Really awesome and a huge time saver.
boston,3d41kv,anazem,6,Mon Jul 13 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the trains are as long as the long side of NYC blocks; if you're standing there waiting for a train, may as well use the time to line yourself up to a door. If you're commuting and need a transfer, being the first one up the steps and not behind the moseying crowd can make or break a smooth transfer (and mean an extra 5-10 mins for another train).  I've spoken with the developer after initially intending to do an app just like it for Boston (then promptly realising I have neither the programming faculties nor the time to do something like this), and they were supposedly inspired by a 2001 New York Times article on a phenomenon they dubbed 'pre-walking'. It's a pretty good read.  Meanwhile, I have Boston friends dismiss my pre-walking habit as a purely New Yorker mindset; my boyfriend has acclimated to my nagging need to not waste extra time walking to an exit if we're going to be waiting for a train to arrive..."
boston,3d41kv,digitalsciguy,5,Mon Jul 13 17:26:55 2015 UTC,"Great article! Thanks for sharing.  And really, pre-walking saves an inordinate amount of time. As the NYT piece said, it is horrible getting stuck behind ""the walking dead"" who just shuffle slowly up the stairs. PAIN!  So you reached out to the Exit Strategy app developer? That's pretty cool. I love what they've done. In addition to the pre-walking facilitation, I really admire the detailed maps they have that superimpose the subterranean station structure onto the ground-level street map. Very fascinating. I've always wondered where they got that info from; city planning documents? personal surveys?  Anyway, glad to have found a fellow impatient New Yorker on these pages. Though, for me, I've only needed to ride the green line to work the last few years, so pre-walking has been the least of my worries...reliability and availability on the other hand..."
boston,3d41kv,anazem,3,Mon Jul 13 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hear that. Boston's small enough that for much of the 5 years I've lived here, I haven't needed more than a 1-seat-ride to the office and reliability of service has been more of an occasional pain point than transfers, but my current job has made me acutely aware of transfer pain since I go from Blue to Orange or vice versa if I don't want to walk up/down State Street to/from work.  The platform maps are actually neighbourhood maps available directly from the MTA that the developer has composited into a somewhat contiguous map. In the app, zoom out of the neighbourhood map from any given station and you'll see the stitching lines. In my version, if you go to the 23rd St station on the IND Sixth Avenue Line (F & V), you'll immediately see what I mean.  That was largely why I stopped working on it - it would be a huge undertaking to document all of that myself on top of learning to develop for mobile. The MBTA does have neighbourhood maps, like this one of Harvard Square, but they're not so granular as to show you station exits and entrances - they're more about showing you the bus network, which is confusing alone in its presentation of multiple colours... I've been considering picking it back up and simply offering it as a bunch of PDFs as a small project for TransitMatters to complete as a tiny victory for transit usability in Boston."

Coming home from Park, it's more important that I get the emptiest car, which is typically the front car, which also happens to not fill up as much at Charles/MGH or Harvard, as it is farthest from the main entrances."
boston,3d41kv,mtrem225,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:10:32 2015 UTC,"My hint for Davis (to get on at the back of the train anyway, going inbound) is to line up with the last ad on the wall. There's a seam just past the last ad that is a bit closer, but that area is usually pretty good. It just sucks because that seems to have more seats available and is a bit less crowded, but I need to take the street exit at Park (to catch the silver line, which is still faster than waiting til DTX) so I have to walk the whole length of the train (ducking around the masses trying to change to the green line) at Park to get out. :/  Also the bench that's under the stairs at Davis, but closest to the front of the train (inbound again), puts you right at the Mass Ave/Western/River exit at Central."
boston,3d41kv,esaevian,3,Mon Jul 13 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"My bit of advice: Unless you're getting off at Harvard, do NOT get on the first car of an inbound train if you can avoid it. Tons of people get to the platform and just bunch up near the entrance rather than walking toward the back of the train.

They see signage like this as an issue with trains not being fully utilised and platform crowding issues. Santiago Metro actually divides the platform at one of its major transfer stations to reduce excessive passenger movement on the platform, which used to contribute to platform congestion. MTA and the MBTA would likely need to negotiate with the unions to allow staff to perform as platform attendants to do something like this to allay their concerns."

boston,3d41kv,-Massachoosite,3,Mon Jul 13 13:09:46 2015 UTC,"If you're getting off at Harvard, I honestly don't go to the front car because, for some reason, no one at that station knows about the concept of letting people off before getting in. You always need to fight your way out of the car and through a mass of people. People at most other stations (at least on the Red Line) seem to understand this concept, but I'm not sure why Harvard can't grasp it. I may only notice this because I only ever get off at Harvard on weekends, when most of the T riders are tourists."

boston,3d41kv,esaevian,4,Mon Jul 13 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"What that means is take the train in the opposite direction from the way you really want to go then after a few stops get on the right train which is, very likely, much less crowded."
boston,3d41kv,MundiMori,4,Mon Jul 13 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"I've never thought of that as a time savings, but more of a wait to ensure a seat. I did this at Davis when the snow was crazy and the trains were packed, I'd just take a train to Alewife, hang around a bit, and have a seat when the train went back inbound. It took a good bit longer, but everyone was late anyway, so might as well."
boston,3d41kv,esaevian,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:55:28 2015 UTC,Why would it be more crowded at Davis than alewife?
boston,3d41kv,MundiMori,2,Mon Jul 13 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why, but it is. The point is that the outbound train is less crowded, so even if there were a ton of people going inbound at Alewife, I still had a fairly empty car in which to claim a seat and just let the flood at Alewife rush in while I stay comfy.  That said, I have noticed that Alewife just isn't as crowded as Davis. It might be a time of morning thing, I'm starting my commute anytime from 8:15-8:45 or 9 (if I'm getting a really late start). Alewife might be a busier scene earlier in the morning, since it has more out of town people driving in, and they may have to get into the city and transfer and stuff which means they need to start traveling earlier."
boston,3d41kv,esaevian,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:25:08 2015 UTC,Oh. Wait. Are you guys talking about being on the train when it turns around?
boston,3d41kv,DaWolf85,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:37:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah. They don't clear you out or anything (unless the train is going out of service).  That said, usually at Alewife, as one train enter, another one leaves. If you're quick enough, you can switch trains so you aren't waiting around as much. The back of the train (going inbound) at Alewife is also almost never used, since it's behind the stairs and you'd have to make a u-turn to get there, which a lot of people don't have time to do when they hear the ""ding-dong"" of the doors closing."
boston,3d41kv,eaglessoar,2,Mon Jul 13 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"This is actually not quite right though. Pearl St. exit at Central is 2nd door, front car, and so is Main St. exit at Kendall. Can't speak to others but I imagine some are similarly slightly off.  Also, the newer trains have four doors, as opposed to three doors on the older cars, so that changes things slightly as well."
boston,3d41kv,Michelanvalo,2,Mon Jul 13 16:50:25 2015 UTC,"To get meta, you can get on a car you know is near a popular exit and be sure to get a seat.  I ride the orange line and the front car (going outbound) pulls right to the exit of Wellington, but a ton of people get on there and they are all going to Wellington and it's packed so you never get a seat.  So now I sit on the car that's doors open at the exit of State, a ton of people get off, I get a seat and am comfortable all the way home!"

boston,3d5m6j,HalfPastTuna,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:54:42 2015 UTC,"If you read into any single one of these terrorist plots thwarted in the United States by the FBI you will find the same answer.  It is always someone with mental illness who is approached by a ""CW""  which is a ""cooperating witness"" (typically someone who is trying to get a lighter sentence on something by acting as an informant/actor with incentive to do as much as they can to secure an arrest) then a selective view of the facts and recordings from the FBI and voilah! They have saved us from another imminent attack by a terrorist who never had any capability in the first place."

boston,3d5m6j,SuperSilver,4,Tue Jul 14 09:26:54 2015 UTC,It is a combination of mental illness and then constant goading and suggestion by the CW in a lot of these cases. The full details on this one are not yet available but if you do a little research you will find that this is not just my own personal pet theory of overbearing police. I will add links in a minute.   example  another  again  There are many examples. Easily found with Google.   Also in many examples the person never has the means to even carry out any sort of plan. The FBI gives them thousands of dollars and strong suggestion of what to do with it. They do this to people that they have 100% knowledge of mental illness. Do you think this is how mental illness should be handled?
boston,3d5m6j,merkaba8,4,Tue Jul 14 13:27:55 2015 UTC,You. I like you. You say what I think.
boston,3d5m6j,whencecameyou,0,Tue Jul 14 12:36:08 2015 UTC,"Actually at the moment, he's statistically more likely to be correct. There is very little indication that the FBI has ever stopped a terrorist plot post 9/11, and in fact all of their supposed successes appear to be entrapment. Also who is to say that the CW didn't advise home to build and procure weapons? That is usually what happens... Maybe you should learn more about terrorism before making pretty dumb statements about it."

Much of the application focuses on travel: where the candidate has been, where the person holds passports from, if the person has crossed into Pakistan and how difficult the person's travel experiences have been.  Strangely, the application also asks for criminal history, medical history and work experience.    Of course, jihadi goals are also inquired about: “Do you wish to execute a suicide operation?” and “What objectives would you like to accomplish on your jihad path?”  The application concludes by asking, “Who should we contact in case you became a martyr?”"

The savings are huge, especially if you share service with someone ($100 for two lines, unlimited everything).  Definitely get the free router, if you talk nicely you can get it without paying the $25 deposit too.  I would suggest borrowing a t-mobile phone, or getting a prepaid sim card, and try it out in your usual areas to be sure the coverage is okay.  Every carrier has bad spots, I was just down in Ikea and the couple next to me had to walk to the windows to make a call, my t-mobile phone had LTE 4-5 bars."
boston,3d5rdj,chickentikka69,3,Tue Jul 14 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"-T-Mobile is fine in the city, but as you start to get out of Boston, it starts to get sketchy fast. That being said, it isn't a replacement for the exceptional service you expect from Verizon or AT&T. They're just that much better, but if you're saving a good amount of money, it's worth it.   -The biggest thing that bugs me about T-Mobile is the lack of coverage DEPTH. Not coverage in general. On their coverage map, it shows that they have fantastic coverage, but it's not true. Go to the Natick Collection. T-Mobile devices are a brick for about 70% of the mall. I've lost contact with my buddies multiple times who wander off. Half of the Macys has working LTE service too. AT&T and Verizon devices have fantastic LTE coverage throughout the entire mall complex. I can go on and on about specific examples where my AT&T/Verizon phones work fine, but TMobile doesn't.  -Just be prepared for the downfalls, such as losing service when you enter into buildings or dropping down to 2G/GPRS, when AT&T and Verizon still maintain LTE connection. T-Mobile is also sketchy in high-traffic areas, such as Longwood hospitals and the pru. My personal device is AT&T. My work phone is Verizon. And I carry around an iPhone on TMobile to compare if I ever want to switch over. If you have any questions about specific locations, lemme know and I'll answer."
boston,3d5rdj,chickentikka69,2,Mon Jul 13 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info about Longwood, I go to MCPHS and spend all my time there, so that's really helpful!"
boston,3d5rdj,pandainaformerlife,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"-Oh nice! I live in Brookline down the street from you. Anyways, I'll be more specific. So their service is fine if you're on street level Longwood. You should be fine inside the main MCPHS building. The service starts to degrade rapidly once you go into Harvard Med or Dental buildings. The food court up the street has good service outside, but again, go inside and LTE drops off rapidly.   -Inside Brigham and Women, Beth Isreal, Dana Faber, it's the same thing. All of these buildings have an indoor DAS (distributed antenna system) that basically puts little cell repeaters inside. AT&T and Verizon are the only ones that pay to put their service on these systems. This is evident when you go deep into BI or B&W and your TMO/Sprint phone show no service, but AT&T/Verizon have bars.  -Also, you're right off Rt.9. That's another trouble spot for TMobile. You're fine on Huntington as you go out to Brookline, but as you pass Brookline, LTE and HSPA are spotty along the entirely of Rt. 9. Basically, you have LTE/HSPA as you go in and out of the different town centers/populated areas. This kills your battery. Very annoying if you're streaming music.  -You notice the same thing on I93, I90, I95, etc. AT&T and Verizon have none of these issues, even if you get out of Boston and into rural areas.  -I think it's important to note that if you spend most of your time in the city, this isn't a big deal. But I tend to drive a lot all over the Northeast and coverage matters."
boston,3d5rdj,Thinkfarms,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"Similar questions get asked in this sub a lot, just fyi. I have T-Mobile and in my experience coverage is pretty great in the city, pretty good on the T, and occasionally terrible in the suburbs/indoors. I used to work in MetroWest and would completely lose mobile data for a good chunk of the commute. I also find wifi calling hit or miss--if I want to make a call inside my apartment I either have to be in the same room as our router or just turn off wifi all together."

boston,3d53lk,SmallLawGuy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:08:09 2015 UTC,"Can you provide documentation or something with the facts of an unfair eviction?  It's not a wrongful eviction in which the landlord is suable? Did they break their lease without notice? Or was it a developer coming in and buying a place, renovating it, and charging an exorbitant amount for rent?  I just think that yes, while we need to reel in what developers are doing as far as charging that much rent is insane, it's not necessarily an unfair eviction?  I just think there is a fine line between charging/increasing rent with no reason or benefit to the tenant over increasing rent due to an extremely high investment into the land.  Example: My landlord didn't increase the rent, but he also didn't put any money into my unit.  I would absolutely incur a $100 rental increase if we got a washer/dryer in the building paid for, with no usage charge, but would argue if he just upped it $100 for no reason."

boston,3d53lk,cowsandmilk,2,Tue Jul 14 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"Great questions /u/avamore! So I don't have the documentation handy but when the committee report comes out, it will include several detail oriented and poignant letters, timelines, and other details that show how this might be construed as unfair (or even illegal).   1) There are rules governing condo conversions. Some in the know think that various evictions (there's really two mass evictions under consideration here even though only one was on the agenda) are condo conversion masquerading as renovation. Fine line when: 2) Rent jumped like $800->1300 for people then they were offered $1300-$3600 or some rubbish. That's crazy. In an economy with scarce resources it's the job of government to regulate how that scarcity may or may not be appropriated by speculators or other interests, when certain actions may impact the health of the market, consumers, or others. Which brings me to: 3) The redeveloping agents seem to have known about things for a long time. But they let people know about eviction last minute after many had lived there for decades. While they seem to have acted within the letter of the law wrt their lease, there are numerous provisions protecting tenants and making it difficult for the landlord to effect changes like this, when they impact the health and safety of tenants."

Excluding some of the new ""super luxury"" places like Millenium Tower, most of these so-called luxury apartments are just regular every day homes.  If they're nicer than the average Boston apartment, it's because the average Boston apartment is a dump.    I live in a ""luxury apartment.""  The finishes in the place cost maybe $2,000 more to construct than absolute bottom of the line.  I have appliances that are the cheapest ones available, but with a faux-stainless finish, and some cheap granite.  What makes this place luxurious?  Nothing really, unless you count the landlord actually fixing things that are broken, and having a dishwasher, washer/dryer, and AC.  Those are things that any modern American home has these days though.    Face it, these $4,000 ""luxury apartments"" would be $3,950 if they weren't luxurious.  99% of what is driving the price is in the insane Boston real estate market.  Supply and demand.

If 50,000 more luxury apartments magically appeared on the market tomorrow, do you really think that prices across the city at all levels would stay flat?  Of course not, landlords would have to start competing for tenants.  Right now, as a landlord, you have it made.  Tenants show up at your door begging to let them have the unit.

New apartments cost $4k because that's what the market supports. Build enough of them and the market will stop supporting ridiculous rent. Otherwise this:   Just tell anyone who isn't rich they aren't welcome anywhere inside 128?    ...will actually happen. See San Francisco for what happens when you build nothing. Whether you build or not, the demand for housing in and near Boston is continuing to increase.

boston,3d31sr,GirlRideBike,3,Mon Jul 13 12:50:29 2015 UTC,"we have over 300 million people in this country, and the country made a fatal mistake in the 20th century by assuming we could just build outwards and ignore density. (This is due to cars as well as not understanding growth curves.) It turns out that nobody wants to live 90 minutes from their jobs.  Boston, along with many cities, has been terrible about extending its public transportation, and it has been worse about increasing density outside the city core. (This is compounded by the inner suburbs prioritizing low density as well.)  As such, the people who can afford not to live 90 minutes away from work are choosing to do so. The luxury apartments stop them from buying up existing stock (IE where most Boston's live).  The real solution is to bust ass and accelerate the plans to improve the lines, because we haven't figured out how to build new cities. This would have to be accompanied by higher densities around these transit stops. I'm a fan of moving the airport further out and turning Logan into a mini-Manhattan, personally."

I think for a lot of people though, it's really frustrating to watch this area become a rich persons playground. Perhaps in another couple of years after the market has been so, so drenched and saturated in luxury housing (which is apparently what a lot of people want in this tread??) that these places that developers spent $15m renovating will be affordable to low and middle income earners? I sincerely doubt it.   I think, perhaps, maybe what the point was is that there's so much damn development happening, catering to the wealthy, with seemingly no support for building affordable housing in an area that didn't have as much money.

If you actually read TCRP report 114, which summarises the issues with the Type 8s as a case study in centre truck performance on light rail vehicles, you'll get a little more background than 'oh, Breda makes shitty trains.' The resolutions - retrofitting the trains with lateral dampers to reduce oscillations and better track maintenance practice - would only prevent derailments in as much as the T is able to maintain better track standards... The problem is less the vehicles and more that the T in some way shape or form was unable to keep the tracks straight enough to keep the car from oscillating laterally so as to cause the centre truck to climb up over the rail. Better track maintenance should be the goal, not engineering the trains to NOT derail no matter how much you neglect the track, which is often how it sounds when people try to deride Breda over the state of affairs at the T.  Edit: Accidentally a word."

Relevant passages from the report:  Defect categorization/response management:   The U.S. procedure consists of identifying different stages (GREEN, YELLOW, and RED) during maintenance inspections and then stating what specific measures are to be undertaken when specific measurements exceed appropriate limit values. These measures were compared with the German requirements. The regulations were seen to be very demanding in terms of short response times (e.g., with RED meaning a reduction of the speed limit to 10 km/h and defect removal within 72 hours). This means that it may be difficult to organize the work needed within the time available in terms of setting up the site, operational measures during the construction period, organizing subcontractors, and so forth. Work is required on the track at the YELLOW stage as well...The analysis showed that the U.S. standards are actually more demanding in terms of quicker response times.   Preventative maintenance:   Even though there are numerous legal requirements, the management of each [German] Transit system and especially the “chief operating superintendent” (Betriebsleiter) has substantial freedom as to how and when maintenance is carried out within the legal limits. This becomes apparent when looking at the maintenance levels throughout different German systems. In general, it is the German philosophy not to work to the maximum wear limit but to have shorter maintenance intervals to ensure problem-free operations and high running comfort and also to save cost. The light rail operator in Karlsruhe generally uses the strategy of “advanced maintenance,” which is linked to the available budget. When sufficient funds are available, a “wear reserve”will be built up, which allows operation with reduced maintenance, using up this reserve, for some years (e.g., 3 to 5 years) on most lines, should a need arise.   Better track maintenance is the obvious end-goal - but only so much is achievable if the modus operandi is ""fix the most fucked up parts as quickly as possible""; it's the same problem with the system writ-large, stuck in a cycle of last ditch major fixes and it's been the problem for a long time with the GL track and even the cars themselves - before the Boeings, the MBTA almost ran out of PCC cars because they kept fixing the most problematic ones rather than scrapping them and just focusing on and improving maintenance turn-around times for the reliable ones. And of course, it costs money to move to a preventative system - if the German model's any indication a better maintained yet less frequently inspected is fully possible, but it needs the initial investment beyond what's allotted for just keeping the system operational.  But let's not let remove all the fault from Breda, they had sparse experience making low-floors, they didn't deliver the world's greatest project, and (off-topic) they've gotten into some bizarre fuck-ups the last few years."

Indeed, I had no intent to fully remove blame from Breda - the conversation often defaults to blaming the manufacturer for shitty trains than to point this out as another case of our current sorry state of (dis)investment in the T dictating maintenance practices."

New York's Capital District is equidistant (90 minute drive) and has a lot of great people and 'life' as well. I grew up there and can tell you that sub is really warm and welcoming to visitors.  It's a million people in that metro, so not too dead.   I'm not sure how long you've been in the Pioneer Valley, but there's an incredible amount of fun shit to do there - and locals are pretty cool.

If you go back to any of the rumors you'll see that they stemmed from Secret Boston (who then drummed up further awareness of their website).  And then Secret Boston went so far as to start blaming the restaurant for not dispelling the thing even though they went on TV to say it was all conjecture.

boston,3d4yzv,JustOneLaoWai,3,Tue Jul 14 14:45:03 2015 UTC,"Michelle, there were a number of times people were posting on your wall sources from Reddit and then you were corroborating it.  I'm sorry (there's the apology I'll provide) if you had a reliable source that ended up being wrong, but it is irresponsible of you to blame the Burren.    If you go back into my comment history (and if you actually read Reddit thoroughly)  you'll see I actually physically stopped by the Burren and asked them in person yesterday afternoon.  They denied it.  That information was then quoted directly on your facebook page for Secret Boston.  You ignored it to drive up interest so that you could be (in your words) a hero if u2 happened to show up.  The fault lies in Secret Boston ignoring some pretty basic facts and then trumpeting them up so as to drive interest in your company.  Furthermore, you now blaming the burren (on twitter, on secret boston's facebook page, and now on your own page) is just you having a poor attitude and not being willing to admit to a mistake.  That to me says more about Secret Boston and you than we need to know.  And now I'm done here.  Best of luck with Secret Boston.  I know a lot of people who like what you do so thank you for making their lives more fun.  Just dare to have a little self-awareness sometimes.

Well that's not what 21st century socialism is - but that doesn't really matter, it's a broad, abstract political theory. Saying 'socialism' does [insert thing] is meaningless. Sander's isn't advocating for central control of the means of production (he's a Democratic Socialist anyways, it's a distinction only people who care waay too much make, but for all intents and purposes it means he isn't from the communist, central party-control branch. Those dudes are fucking nuts) - at most he's a proponent of workplace democracy, but that's about as red as he gets. Redistribution of wealth is both a) an age-old system, b) present in conservative capitalist societies as well, and c) a net positive for the common good (assuming the political process isn't perverted for personal gains or sectarian gains - which has happened multiple times in Boston's history, cough Curley cough).   I'm not particularly fond of the hard left, too much of the high-concept, big-idea, ""we'll deal with the details later"" mentality, but designating everything bad as socialist is harmful to society. Taxes aren't socialist, redistribution isn't socialist, disincentives are present in our current system (for example, would you argue the current system bond-backed tuition for higher-ed incentives more or less people than a system present in some Euro countries where that education is free) as well as lefty wet-dream governments.

While the wars, and ""dubya"" were after that point, and included approximately 2.7 trillion in ""borrowed"" money adding to the unfunded liabilities, it is untrue to say that all the liabilities come from the second Bush presidency.   When you look at the first person to receive her social security check, you see the bigger problem and that is indeed, by definition, a ponzi scheme. She paid in 24 dollars and in the course of her life received 23,000 from social security.   And as an FYI, I will be voting for Rand Paul as his ideas are more libertarian and that's what I feel this country needs. But just because someone is critical of socialism and points out problems with socialist programs as I had done (or even doesn't like socialism), it doesn't mean they are a main stream Republican that will support any Bush put on the ballot."

Ok, so sometimes he refers to himself as a ""democratic socialist.""  What is the difference? I've spent time on the Democratic Socialists of America website. The circular reasoning makes me dizzy.  It's just the same old blather... effectively - ""big companies have too much control and they are evil, and we should restore power to the people.""   Well, capitalism provides a non-violent mechanism for ""the people"" to gain back control. They can stop buying the products of big companies. For example, people can stop buying smart phones, smart cars, smart watches, smart homes, and smart tvs, without the risk of being jailed.  And when the people take back control by voting with their dollars, those companies either evolve (to become more responsive to their customers) or die.  An example of this are companies like Walmart becoming powerful allies of those in  favor of Gay rights and reducing waste. They have also started to voluntarily raise minimum wages for hundreds of thousands of their lower-paid workers. They're not going to fool anyone into thinking the value purpose more than profit, they just know that if their policies are not aligned with the values of their customers they will go out of business.  Socialism, or any form of it, has historically failed to provide such a non-violent mechanism for change.  Blowhards rise to power by effectively promising to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor, and somehow create massive wealth for themselves and their cronies in the process.   They, always, maintain their power by making the masses reliant on government, and they use coercion and the threat of violence to keep everyone else in line. This is why the people of Venezuela, for example, continued to elect, democratically, leaders like Hugo Chavez. In fact if you compared the rhetoric of Hugo Chaves to Bernie Sanders, you would have a hard time distinguishing the two.  To say Sanders supports the capitalist mode of production, while being a socialist... anything, is farcical. Capitalism, like socialism, or any other form of collectivism, have distinct meanings. One cannot be part capitalist and part socialist."

That's the irony of all our other politicians using the word ""socialist"" to sling mud: crony-capitalists and crony-socialists are two sides of the same coin.   Democratic socialism, the brand of socialism that Bernie Sanders subscribes to, is neither. We have empirical examples of how it works. Healthcare in social democracies is cheaper yet more comprehensive. Education in social democracies is cheaper yet more comprehensive. Civil liberties in social democracies are more intact than they are in the US."
boston,3d2j4j,DeBurgo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"Empirical examples proving healthcare in social democracies is cheaper yet more comprehensive? Most people i've encountered who have made similar claims have had anecdotal evidence to share. And the anecdotes work both ways. For example, there are many reports in Canada, the UK, etc, of very long wait lists for certain types of care. Such systems also, often, prioritize the young over the old. And many of those systems rely on medical technology and drugs whose innovation is effectively subsidized by the US.  Similarly, comparing the healthcare system of the United States to Scandinavian countries is not a fair comparison. They are relatively tiny countries, with extreme limitations on immigrants, and have very little ethnic diversity. They have very few free riders compared to the US which has many free riders. I suspect many conservatives in America would welcome the tradeoff of socialist healthcare if that meant exiling the free riders and preventing new ones from immigrating.   Perhaps you have new ""empirical"" evidence, but the data i've seen from people purporting to have the same is cherry-picked data that often confuses causation with correlation.   As for education, I would suspect there is a cheaper yet more [effective] system we could be adopting. We have seen education ""investments"" skyrocket in the US over the past 40 years without much improvement. I'm curious what models for improved education you have seen."

Perhaps you misunderstand what socialism is, why it threatens anyone who believes individuals should be free to pursue what happiness is to them, and the destructive force it has had whenever it is applied. Capitalism, any time it has been faithfully applied, has led to results like - cheaper and more abundant food, income mobility (the makeup of the one percent is constantly in flux despite popular rhetoric), and a decline of totalitarianism."

They have way MORE income mobility.    It isn't about capitalism, because Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Iceland, and Canada are all capitalist. They encourage companies (christ, look at the founder of IKEA), and they encourage individual contribtions.    They also offer universal health care, which if you are an adult that has to deal with medical bills, I don't know how you can oppose it. They offer support from socoety, allowing you the freedom to take risks.

Also, on medical bills, I'm not talking about whether or not you should pay them. I'm saying it's a complicated system where you have no idea what things are going to cost you, and where the individual has no power. It encourages people to not seek medical help because of the unknown of price. It's a broken system that needs to be fixed.

I knew the snow would eventually go away but I was getting really depressed by seeing so much snow around us so I wanted a reminder that the snow was actually melting. I took daily pictures on my iPhone with it balanced against my window.  At first I tried to line up the pictures on my own in Photoshop but each pic was off by a few degrees in many directions so it was fruitless.  Then I found that Photoshop has a feature just for this.  You can load a stack of images at once and there's a check box for 'attempt to align images.'  it works amazingly well and gave me all I needed to use Flash to do the rest of the animation.

Just wanted to jump in to state that, for what it's worth, there are always ~1,300 bikes (give or take a few receiving maintenance) available in the Hubway system distributed among 140 stations. Bikeshare's big challenge is always the balancing of stations in terms of dock & bike availability, but you're right that in essence it boils down to location & times. Not blaming you, of course, for that, but the idea is that if a station has 10 bikes at 8am that are gone by 9am, it's because 10 people got rides and 0 arrived at the same station at that time. But those bikes are in the system somewhere, and our dispatch and field staff teams are working to rebalance that throughout the day. In peak season, there are over 6,000 trips taken on Hubway each day. Sparing the nitty-gritty of those rebalancing efforts for now, we can suggest a couple tools; the first is to make sure you have an app like Spotcycle, Biximo, BOS Bikes, or CityMapper (they're all free and get info from the same feed) that will show you real-time availability at any station in the system, and the second tool which would feed your curiosity if you want to go down a rabbit-hole is www.hubwaytracker.com, which not only shows real-time specs but also historical data of all the station outages (either empty or full) and availability at any given time in history -- great for looking at trends, especially if you have any flexibility in your travel times. Our dispatch managers are overseeing the system, but feel free to share the stations and times where/when you are seeing that outage, so that we can report to the cities/towns about resources and where expansion can help to alleviate that type of experience."

Until I had canceled my credit cards this morning there still hadn't been any unauthorized use which made me think it could possibly still be in my house somewhere but I've looked absolutely everywhere. I even cut open the trash bag that we took out that morning and dug through it in case it accidentally fell in there.

I would say do the Aquarium first, take the Blue line to Bowdoin and walk to the MOS from there (maybe a 10 minute walk), and then the Green line goes from the MOS right to the Pru.  Or you could do that in reverse order.  To pay, there are automated kiosks at all of the stations. You will want to buy a Charlie Ticket for Bus & Subway. Rides cost $2.65 a piece with a Charlie Ticket, and you don't need to pay again to switch trains.

boston,3d5bcz,cpxh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"LL can pretty much decide how they want to handle this. So just give them what they want UP TO 1st month, last month, 1 month security deposit, & change of lock fee. Do not pay for cleaning fee, initial pet deposit, background or credit check, etc.  LL is 100% liable for all snow and ice on the property and they cannot pass this liability onto you. Still there is nothing illegal with them offering to knock some amount off of each months rent if you help them shovel, or to up the amount on the lease (prior to you signing it) if you refuse to help. But they cannot require you to help, and you are not liable if someone slips and falls. Owner occupied is tricky here. Make sure they know you have a baby just to be safe.  They must provide access to hot water, but you can be required to pay for the gas/oil/electricity used to heat the water. This is only the case when you have your own dedicated water heater. If its a 3 story house with only 1 hot water tank in the basement then your LL is responsible for paying for hot water.    All this info and more can be found here"

Yes, it's a private library, but it's a really good value: you get insanely quiet workspaces, wifi all over, online resources and database access, over a hundred periodicals and journals (physical and digital archives), plus well, a circulating library.  Cons: no phone calls except in the lobby. We keep one floor entirely quiet, too, though on others quiet conversation is always welcome. Also, bag check is currently being redone and anything over the size of a small handbag can't be taken in (contents can, in provided clear totes).   Pros: no annoying people on phones, beautiful surroundings, and seriously  amazing research staff to help you find what you need!  You don't have to be somehow sponsored to join, just pay the annual fee. Though our patrons do tend to be older, there's a booming amount of under 35 folks too. Also wine, and cheese. Often."

Best thing to do IMO is to hike up to the AMC hut the walk out to the open part of the falls and climb up them to the beautiful cascade at the top.

It's a loop and about 9 miles and not too, too strenuous but not easy either. Plus you get to stop at a hut for a break, and the ridge walk is gorgeous. It's also less driving than most other hikes in the area.  Downsides is that it's one of the most popular trails in the whites so don't expect to be alone."

Perhaps it's cost prohibitive, but a return to the power station at 540 Harrison would be so much better, especially if it allowed for many more vendors. Generally, the whole event (vintage and open market) seems to be slightly off-track, partially because there are more visitors than ever.

boston,3d10gz,trumpeteur,2,Sun Jul 12 16:58:06 2015 UTC,It's been a while since I've read up on this stuff since I don't work directly with building codes that much anymore but based on my best recollections the plot was zoned for residential use and there is likely something wrong with the property that would require a clean up such as HAZMAT concerns or there are issues with development on the plot itself such as an easement.    You could always call the assessment department in Boston and ask.
boston,3d10gz,funkymunniez,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:23:47 2015 UTC,"I know the plot had a house on it in the 70s that burned down, and then the people who owned the house next to it purchased it to have a sweet huge yard. The owners then moved and sold the house and lot separately, so I was wondering what the buyer can do with it.   It's a really narrow lot for the neighborhood... I wish I could find a picture of what the house on it looked like.   Anyway, thanks for the info!"

They'll most likely send you a letter for what is proposed at that time because you are a neighbor. if you disagree with the proposal you could say so at that time and it would be taken into consideration. Or if you are just interested you could find out that way. Or you could introduce yourself to the new owner and ask.

It's not urban like Boston, Worcester etc. Source: grew up and lived there over 30yrs.  As for that hotel I think that's the one off the Pike. Good luck. There are way better hotels in the area for probably short money. It's not a bad area but that hotel is a known to be sketchy one.  Also why not stay in Foxborough , closer to the stadium?"
boston,3d2o0s,Spedmunky,3,Mon Jul 13 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info I appreciate it. I'll consider that before booking. It was the cheapest hotel in the area ($95, compared to hotels near the stadium that were at least $150). Sadly I have a college student budget so I looked at the cheapest. Now after what you said I may reconsider."
boston,3d2o0s,SmackySmack,2,Mon Jul 13 03:08:44 2015 UTC,"Crown plaza, Hampton Inn, Sheraton near it are all way nicer. Probably not near as cheap.

There's a motel 6 not too far too. Edit: Red Roof has decent Google reviews so maybe it changed."

That hotel is right off the Mass Pike and has been known for people using it on an hourly basis.  I also wanted to bring up that parking at Gillette Stadium can give you sticker-shock.  If you are going to see an act like Taylor Swift (only concert I know of end of month) then they will probably charge $40 a car for parking.  Something to consider when making your decision.

Hopefully something like that will happen this time."

boston,3d2o0s,truthseeeker,2,Mon Jul 13 02:51:53 2015 UTC,"Depending on the day, traffic could really suck. Framingham isn't really a straight shot to Gillete.   I would stay anywhere along 95. For example, Attleboro to Gillette is 18 minutes. As far south is Pawtucket. Plus, if you're coming from New York, you're driving 40 mins past your destination. Anywhere along 95 is right on your way. You'll save on gas, even if the hotel is a bit more expensive."
boston,3d2o0s,griph00k,2,Mon Jul 13 04:36:41 2015 UTC,"The Motel is fine.  However, try to find a closer one to the stadium.  There has got to be a closer one that is a comparable price."

There's some shady activity there on occasion (as with most similarly located motels), but I wouldn't go as far as to call it unsafe if you're just crashing for the night. There's a 24-hour Dunkins next door that can have a decent police presence late night, which I'm sure helps.

A few are specifically seafood restaurants, like New Jumbo and East Ocean City.  Bubor Cha Cha as well, I think.  There's a place on the street that runs along the gate (I don't know any of the street names, just where things are) that advertises abalone with abalone sauce.  It won't be cheap, though.  You can also get it in cans at most big Chinese grocers -- I would check C-Mart, Super 88, and Ming's (Ming's may even have the shellfish itself).  There's also that other supermarket in Chinatown.  You can probably find abalone sauce at any of these -- it's light orange, salty and sweet at the same time.  Pretty good, actually.  XO sauce is often made with/for abalone as well, and it's also delicious, but it can be expensive in the larger containers so check the price before you overpay.  $4 for a small jar is fine.  $20 for a larger one, probably not.  I've never actually gotten abalone at a restaurant, so I can't attest for how good it may or may not be.  Actual abalone may also be illegal to harvest, so it's possible that the abalone you'll find is actually some other, similar giant shellfish.  I don't know anything about that."

Most of the stadium was demolished in 1955, but significant portions of the original structure still stand and make up part of the Nickerson Field sports complex on the campus of Boston University."
boston,3cw155,B0pp0,7,Sat Jul 11 06:29:10 2015 UTC,It's a shame that Nickerson got hemmed in by the Pike and that BU had deemphasized any sport not called ice hockey.

boston,3cw155,B0pp0,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:55:56 2015 UTC,Football is a high risk/high benefit sport. BU simply decided that as a school in a relatively unique position that it would be more cost effective to divert the money for a palace for hockey than tool around D1-AA/FCS.
boston,3cw155,Dharmasabitch,-7,Sat Jul 11 16:40:07 2015 UTC,crush of Title IX   Because only men's sports deserve funding!
boston,3cw155,B0pp0,3,Sat Jul 11 21:15:36 2015 UTC,Thing is in the name of equality it's men who have taken it on the ear. Could equality have been enforced without Title IX?
boston,3cw155,Dharmasabitch,-1,Sat Jul 11 21:30:21 2015 UTC,"How have men ""taken it on the ear""? It equalized funding and required that schools can no longer neglect women's sports in favor of men's. Now our female athletes dominate the rest of the world in everything, and it's pretty much destroyed the stereotype of women being nonathletic because women now participate in sports in equal numbers. So yes, it diverted funding from men's sports, but that's only because the funding was unequal and the people doing the funding refuse to just bring women's funding to the level of men's, instead they reduce men's to raise women's and then blame the regulations. If women teams were getting tons of money but nobody was signing up I would understand the complaint, but that's not what is happening, girls now feel like if they join a sport they will be invested in, unlike previously where they basically were treated like second class athletes."
boston,3cw155,B0pp0,3,Sat Jul 11 21:35:27 2015 UTC,Because doing the lazy thing of cutting from men to lift women rather than just lifting women sends a bad message. And I'm an egalitarian in saying this but at which point does it become feasible to offer nothing besides basketball and some mix of football/baseball/hockey? What message does that send to our young boys?
boston,3cw155,Dharmasabitch,-1,Sat Jul 11 21:48:26 2015 UTC,"Again, you're missing the point. The law says nothing about cutting from men. All it says is that women must be given equal athletic opportunities as men with equal funding. That is exactly what you are describing. It is the institutions themselves who decide that they won't raise their own athletic budget, they'll keep it constant and take from men. If you don't like that for instance BU cuts funding from men to give to women, then you should take it up with BU, not Title IX. It is BU administration deciding that is how they will equalize the budget. They could just as well take a bunch of money from the department that spams high school seniors with giant packets of crap, and give that to the women, and leave the men's budget unchanged. But they don't, for whatever reason.  OH LOOK DOWNVOTES BUT NO ONE CAN TELL ME HOW I'M WRONG"

boston,3cw155,Dharmasabitch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:55:25 2015 UTC,"You're right, I unfairly characterized what you literally said because the implication of Title IX crushing male athletic programs is that they are somehow worth more than female athletic programs. All Title IX says is that they deserve equal scope and funding. It's unfortunate that schools fund girls programs by taking from boys but that is the school's choice, not the fault of Title IX. The only reason they have to cut into boys funding is because they were unfairly prioritizing boy's sports to begin with."

The stands were almost entirely in foul territory, leaving little in the outfield to which players could hit a home run into - with the fences over 400 feet away down the lines and nearly 500 feet to dead center, hitting the ball over the outer fences was all but impossible during the dead-ball era."

boston,3ctt7n,1SkyPilot,0,Fri Jul 10 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"I was in London that summer as well. I do think London did well (better than most cities) and it was interesting to see all of the lead up to it. However, London is a lot bigger than Boston and has a much larger infrastructure. And the idea of transplanting all of it, from Olympic Park to the tourist outreach just seems really insane.  It's not really ""not in my backyard"" so much as ""my backyard isn't big enough."""
boston,3ctt7n,Miz_pizzyizz,11,Sat Jul 11 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"This is a very, shortsighted view on this which worries me that Boston could get the Olympics but won't.  Firstly its not ""wasted money"" at all, its an investment for Boston. If Boston 2024 goes through its creating 4.1k construction jobs from 2018-2023 and 50,000 jobs to support the games in the build up to 2024. Thats a massive job creation for the area and the amount of jobs that it will leave behind to support the infrastructure and business created. Also for the areas developed for the games it increases their capacity to create tax revenue. Currently the Widett circle area creates 857k a year, by 2030 it will be about $7m a year in tax revenues.   Now to the most important part is the infrastructure left behind by the games, public transportation, stadiums, parks etc. When I walked through London's old 2012 Olympic Park it was incredible to see. The way they transformed everything to serve the public and how popular it seemed to be with everyone, shopping center, parks that were never there before. The possibilities with the Olympic stadium after the olympics is huge, the New England Revolution could use this as chance to finally move into Boston (alot like what West Ham are doing in London). This is another long term thing adding another sports team in a huge growing market for soccer is huge. Currently Boston is untapped for soccer since Foxboro is too far away for many people to make the trip to a game. Also stadium could hold other events bringing more revenue into the city.   Public transportation would also see a huge increase in quality and capacity, currently I think the T is really poor quality public transport compared to other major cities across the world. The games could be used as a catalyst to finally solve most of those issues.  More importantly Boston being the center of the sporting world for three weeks would be an amazing thing, would make Boston truly a world recognized city. Which at the moment I don't think it currently is.   There are many more positives that come out of the games, but I'm too tired to find and go through my work to find them. Its just the negative attitude that people have towards the games is just well very sad."

boston,3ctt7n,qu4ttro,15,Fri Jul 10 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"Everything you mention is possible by investment and without the cost of the Olympics on top of it.  On top of that is the fact that in order to win the bid we'd have to 'start right away' on Widett Circle, meaning the purchase and release of the land to a developer would have to happen immediately.  Thus, the plan is that if the IOC doesn't give us the Olympics after all, the developer would still get to go ahead with Widett Circle.  And in order to do that with zero risk of turning a profit, he'll need a big tax deduction...so all that tax money you quote won't turn up for years in order to make building (in what everyone says is so lucrative a spot) worth his while...which he'll get to do whether we get the Olympics or not if we go through with any of this.  In other words, this whole thing is a land grab and has nothing to do with the Olympics.  The Olympics don't have to turn a profit in order for people to make money at the public's expense.  They don't even have to occur at all in Boston.  But if we start down this road, we're going to fundamentally alter the city for private profit at public expense.  There's a reason Boston residents aren't the first to tell a sponsoring committee to piss off when it comes to hosting the Olympics these days.  We're able to see the history of Greece, Russia, and London with the Olympics and Brazil with the World Cup.  We know that there's NOTHING stopping us from doing any of the improvements you describe without getting involved with the risk, timelines, and costs of the Olympics.  We know that the IOC of today is corrupt and demanding and has no interest in the host city's needs or wants just like FIFA which is finally getting its come-uppance.  If you want to talk about turning Widett Circle into ""Midtown"" or how to improve the MBTA for its ever-increasing volume, then let's do it.  But using the Olympics as pre-text is intellectually bankrupt since it adds cost and risk unnecessarily."

You're willing to settle for that...plus beach volleyball, because someone else hasn't given you a better answer yet?

Until there's movement on an alternative, I'm happy to not let the good be the enemy of the perfect. What I WANT is the T to work - full stop.   You've got some problems with your post though. First of all, the development at Widett isn't tax free; it's a percentage tax break on something that doesn't currently exist, which amounts to a net tax gain now that balloons to a huge net tax gain in the future. Second, we aren't forced to spend money on the MBTA; we're forced to spend money that we've already allocated to the MBTA, and we're forced to actually follow through on it, unlike the laundry list of delayed projects like the Green Line Extension, the Red/Blue connector, the Blue Line to Lynn, the North/South Rail Link, DMU service, South Station expansion, etc., etc., ad naseum. And third, all of those projects aren't FOR the Olympics; they're FOR day to day transportation.  Seriously, if you've got an alternative suggestion, I'd love to hear it.

As for facilities specific to an Olympic event, it comes in two flavours:  Some facilities are fairly ""resellable"" -- a large open-air or enclosed stadium, can, in theory, be leased out to a pro team, like your soccer example.  Those are probably the less wasteful expense, assuming you were going to build a similar stadium in the first place, and negotiate the lease well in advance.  The problem is if you build it HOPING someone will take up occupancy later; they may never come or demand expensive reconfiguration, running you further into the red.  The other type is the true ""albatross"" facilities.  There is no future lessee, so at best you'll be able to convert it to a public service or dramtically retool it.  Yes, you can turn an aquatics centre into a city pool, but that's the most expensive way to get a public pool imaginable-- you'll never recover the costs selling $6 day tickets.  You can try to argue it, but I think people with stronger economics backgrounds and more data than I have already done so.

However,     In the model, we obtain a separating equilibrium where bidding to host a mega-event provides a positive signal about future policy intentions.

After coming out a few years ago, I've found it somewhat difficult to make gay friends here. The community can be surprisingly cliquey, but so can any community. Just makes things somewhat difficult.  If you don't fall into a particular gay ""type,"" navigating the waters can be tricky and feel somewhat unfriendly at first.

Go STRAIGHT to nearest police station where it was stolen. Bring PRINTED copies of the GPS location with timestamp printed on it if you can, so it's submitted with the report. Time is ticking here.

boston,3cw4by,Meverseyou,6,Sat Jul 11 19:04:03 2015 UTC,"only thing you can really do is file a police report. if you have a serial number, the phone goes into a database of stolen property so that if it is ever recovered by police, it is flagged and has your information attached.   then if you have insurance, file an insurance claim.     unlike what you will see on TV and movies (or what the salesperson tries to tell you), the GPS on a phone is not accurate enough to pinpoint the phone to a specific residence (especially in a dense city), and wouldn't be evidence enough to mobilize a police force to go knocking on doors. if the GPS is accurate within 50 feet in a city, it could be in dozens of separate residences, and police are not going to knock on dozens of doors and ask the residents to search their houses to try and find it.  the very best you could hope for is that there is a department with nothing else better to do and doesn't mind wasting their time (and taxpayer money) to humor you for a little while and check the area with you. no department would be willing to do this without a stolen property report on file though, and it's very unlikely they will go into private residences based on a phone GPS.     even if you have a car stolen the police don't go 'looking for it'. it goes into a stolen vehicle database so that if anybody ever runs the plate it pops as stolen. if you have lojack, it pings to police cruisers so active patrol can hone in on it. it's a lot harder to hide a car in an apartment than a 5 inch cell phone."

I lost my phone a couple of weeks ago, used Find my iPhone and traced it to Dorchester. Girlfriend suggested that maybe I just left it in the taxi and that we should go to the location to see if there was a taxi there. Long story short, it wasn't in a taxi, Find my iPhone was pinpointing to a ""members-only"" type of private establishment. There was no one around at the time, so I didn't go knocking on the door. I called the police non-emergency number and they told me to call 911; Yes, call 911 to report a lost/stolen phone. They sent officers to the scene and by the time they arrived (~4hours later) there were lots of people at the establishment. The police and I walked inside (the front door was open) and explained the situation to the manager. They helped us look for the phone, which we ultimately found in a dumpster out back, completely smashed.   TL;DR - Called the police to report lost/stolen phone, was advised to call 911. Police arrived on scene (eventually) and helped me find my phone."

Contrary to what everyone think, the gps is on a house without a another house close to it and it is a single family dwelling. The gps is definitely accurate within the range between this house and he others around it. I think Chelsea has its sketchy areas but I've been in and lived in worse places. In the end I was go over there with some people and get it back but realize it was stupid because there was a chance for someone to get hurt or worse and it's not worth it for a phone. The one thing that pisses me off is that phone is totally bricked now unless they part it out and I don't see how it was at all worth stealing. Anyway, please excuse all the typos.

boston,3cw4by,jewhyphenlee,-4,Sat Jul 11 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"Record the location and go there asking for the phone. If they want proof, show them the picture of the gps. If they refuse, ask the police."
boston,3cw4by,KeepMarijuanaIllegal,5,Sat Jul 11 13:20:43 2015 UTC,Let's reverse the order of those steps there.
boston,3cw4by,chabz5000,-2,Sat Jul 11 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"The police aren't going to do anything. It's kind of weird but i guess they just don't care about phones or items under a certain value. If they stole your car for example they would do something about it.  Let it go or show up to the house with a couple friends with baseball bats. This isn't advised, but it's an option."
boston,3cw4by,KeepMarijuanaIllegal,2,Sat Jul 11 16:04:39 2015 UTC,"they'll take reports for any stolen property, but most likely won't go hunting to recover anything at all regardless of value.   any property that is reported stolen and has serial numbers (plate or VIN for vehicles) is entered into stolen property databases, and if they are ever recovered by any police dept in the country can be tracked back to you based on your initial larceny report. if you don't have a serial number, you can still report your item lost but the only chance it will ever be returned is if the original agency recovers the property and is able to match it to your report by physical description.   stolen cars are often recovered because people dump them out in the open, and there is really no place to hide them. stolen plates/VINs will hit any time any PD runs the listing, and if the car has lojack it will ping in a police cruiser and they can zero in on it. as such, cars are recovered way more often than smaller items like phones, but it's not because the cops are out there searching for it.   it's not that they don't care (and it wouldn't really matter if they did or didn't), it's that proactively searching for stolen property isn't really part of their job, and would cost the city way more in man hours than the property is worth if they just went out searching for it. they document the crime, flag your property as stolen and facilitate the return if by chance it is recovered. detectives will follow up on a report if there is an investigative lead, but most of the time there is nothing to go on."
boston,3cw4by,chabz5000,0,Sun Jul 12 07:30:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, this makes sense I guess. I think the going out searching excuse is kind of lame in cases where the person has a unit showing precise gps location data. Then it isn't searching at all is it.  It seems that unless I am caught and arrest by police in the act of stealing, I get away with the crime essentially."

boston,3cwwfz,crwent,4,Sat Jul 11 14:12:33 2015 UTC,I lived there for 5 years until I was 28. I still go there a lot because theres a ton of places to eat and one of my favorite bars is there. Allston is very central to a lot of places and I think it has character. It does have a younger crowd but I would have no problem living there as long as youre not on a street with a bunch of party houses.
boston,3cwwfz,Made_in_Boston,2,Sat Jul 11 14:22:51 2015 UTC,"Same for me, I lived around that block in my late 20's. The area was fine, plenty of bars and restaurants around. The train was sometimes crowded, the green line is also a pain, but nothing real to complain about. Only moved away to be in a bigger apartment near the red line."
boston,3cwwfz,Baron_Von_D,2,Sat Jul 11 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Alston for five years, I'm 25.  It's not a bad place, all things considered.  It's over priced for what it is, but that's true of most of Boston.  My big warning is to be really careful of who you rent from.  Alpha owns a lot of buildings in the neighborhood, and some realtors aren't very forthcoming about who owns your building.  And personally, I'd rather live in my car than rent from alpha.  Be aware that there is basically no where to park in Alston, but public transit isn't too bad around here.  So yeah, good luck with all that."
boston,3cwwfz,LordEyebrow,3,Sat Jul 11 15:19:58 2015 UTC,"I lived there for 2 years, loved the area. Cheaper neighborhood but not too run-down, and not too far from downtown. My building didn't allow undergrads which is nice but I saw a lot of people my age (mid to late 20's). Certainly lots of students but I wouldn't let that stop you."

boston,3cwwfz,HoboViking,3,Sat Jul 11 19:56:40 2015 UTC,"I am a young professional currently living in the Allston area in one of the Green district buildings right by Natalie's pizza. My building is all young professionals, not students. The area is nice because you're right in Allston, with cheap eats and undergrads, but you are also a 10 min walk from Washington Square and Coolidge Corner, which are more grown up crowds (but with grown up prices). These areas are usually where I hang out at night. My building is also cheaper than comparable buildings in Brookline.   The B line is annoying, true. I don't rely on it for daily transportation to work, but my friends who do find it very annoying. The C and D lines are definitely better, if that is a consideration for you. I use the B line during the weekends occasionally, and I don't have any major complaints with sporadic use.   I would be careful about taking comments from people who lived in this area in the past because it has definitely changed a lot in the past few years."
boston,3cwwfz,amberspyglss,2,Sun Jul 12 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"I lived there from about 27 to 33, just moved a couple months ago to the south end.  I like it a lot there.  Lots of good food, cool youthful city vibe.  My biggest gripe is the B line, it makes for a really unpleasant commute.  If you have to take it for your commute I would reconsider."
boston,3cwwfz,-MadGadget-,2,Sat Jul 11 17:46:37 2015 UTC,"That's a great block for someone looking to avoid the undergrads but still live in Allston. Starbucks and The bees knees market opening up in that block as well as the ""green district"" apartments/condos have added some class to the neighborhood. I live a couple blocks away by CVS, and have had very few problems with noise etc. sometimes yes I hear people on the sidewalks, but it's a city what do you want lol. I love allston. It's affordable, safe, has character, great dining options and easy access to most of the city.  Plus it's kinda cool that Brookline is like a block away, I just walk less than ten minutes to Coolidge corner when I want a little break from the allston.  It's such a sharp contrast to Allston and nice to have nearby. That's my two cents anyway. Good luck!  Edit: ps yes avoid alpha management and Natalie's lol"

If you want to be over there, try living somewhere on the c-line, which is for grown ups. Well, at least that's what the mbta thinks. When you're actually on the b line,you'll notice that's it's not ONLY college students but a majority. But I'm pretty sure mbta just thinks Allston is full of bu students and therefore doesn't need to provide an adequate amount of trains.   Jp, Davis, porter, brookline would all be better options. I am 25 and lived in Allston for less than a year. Not a native, and wouldn't tolerate that neighborhood, here or in any other city, unless it was half the rent."

Just ""Industry Oriented"" as it was a Monday Brunch, not Sunday Brunch, and they're some of the few people who are willing and able to starting day drinking with a Chocolate Quick White Russian (Yea, you read that right) at noon on a weekday.  Most ""Industry Nights"" aren't exclusive to those people, rather just promoted to them since they're off nights.

Girlfriend suggested that maybe I just left it in the taxi and that we should go to the location to see if there was a taxi there. Long story short, it wasn't in a taxi, Find my iPhone was pinpointing to a ""members-only"" type of private establishment. There was no one around at the time, so I didn't go knocking on the door. I called the police non-emergency number and they told me to call 911; Yes, call 911 to report a lost/stolen phone. They sent officers to the scene and by the time they arrived (~4hours later) there were lots of people at the establishment. The police and I walked inside (the front door was open) and explained the situation to the manager. They helped us look for the phone, which we ultimately found in a dumpster out back, completely smashed.  TL;DR - Called the police to report lost/stolen phone, was advised to call 911.

Parking at Alewife overnight is $8/night, and the transit time from there to the airport (door to door to each terminal) is about 45 minutes (or you can take a cab for ca. $40 or so; there is a taxi stand at the station). This is cheaper than any lot near the airport that I know of, and Alewife also has the advantage of being really easily accessible from the highway.  The catch is that the lot fills up on weekdays pretty routinely.  If you can go on a weekend or at an odd hour (arriving before 8 AM, say, although that's obviously not ideal for a transatlantic flight), it should be doable.

boston,3cpxxo,js1030,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:51:27 2015 UTC,"You are incorrect. The people of MA do NOT pay anything to productions here. That's not how the Film Tax Incentives work. At the end of the fiscal year when the production companies are doing taxes, that's when the incentives kick in; based on how much money they spent in state."
boston,3cpxxo,RockHockey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:35:57 2015 UTC,"You are correct that the credit is 25% of the MA spending.  But Since the MA Tax is only 5%, the state is subsidizing at least 20%.  The problem is the a HUGE amount of what they spend is to companies that come to MA to do the work but are not based in MA.    There is still a 20% Subsidy and that comes from our state budget.  Why are we spending 20% to bring Hollywood to Boston? What is so special that they need 25% of their expenses refunded.     What is so ""Special"" is it is supposed to ""promote"" MA.  Pretending Beantown is NYC doesn't do that.  Besides the fact that the incentive is wasteful."
boston,3cpxxo,js1030,2,Thu Jul 16 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"This tax incentive employs hundreds if not thousands of local workers and supports many in state businesses. And more in state businesses are popping up to meet the growing demands of the local  film industry. All of this activity is bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars every year that wouldn't be here otherwise.  A HUGE amount of spending is NOT going to out of state businesses.  Shooting in Boston for a movie that's supposed to take place elsewhere is still good for tourism. People are excited to visit locations and landmarks used in movies as well as just the city itself. And people are excited to walk by a big, real Hollywood set and see all the equipment and crew and maybe their favorite actors.  Tell me which is better; 75% of hundreds of millions of dollars of local economic activity generated every year or 100% of $0 if there was no incentive program? Take a look at Louisiana which had a booming film industry and just capped their tax incentives. Most projects are packing up which leaves thousands of workers unemployed and families strained and stranded. Then take a look at California, where they didn't have the tax incentives like they do now until just recently. A big chunk of their film workers went to NYC and Louisiana to work. Now some have returned from both states and some are staying in NYC because there is more work there than in Hollywood/Los Angeles!"

""The Globe reported that in 2012 the state’s film tax credit cost Massachusetts $78.9 million.

boston,3cpxxo,js1030,2,Fri Jul 17 16:07:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not counting each movie as a separate job, but when multiple projects are working concurrently and each has 125-200+ workers, well, then that's in the hundreds, if not thousands depending on how busy it is at any given time.  I believe biotech already has subsidies, and has had them for many years. French fry production? Does that bring in the same amount of jobs and money to the state? I'm not sure and don't care to look.    If you're interested in the facts and details, check out this website: http://savemafilmjobs.com/faq/  Q. Can you tell me a little bit about what the Film Tax Incentive is?  The Massachusetts Film Tax Incentive was created and passed to attract film productions to the state. Productions spend a large amount of money in the local economy and create jobs for local people. It is widely known in the industry that a state can be the most beautiful place on Earth, but a production will favor a state that has an incentive and likely go there.  Q. Hollywood movies and TV actors live in California. How does a tax credit benefit MA at all?  The answer to this question is three fold. Most importantly: movies and TV spend a lot of money in the state they are filming in. Here’s how:   Movie and TV productions spend money that benefits the state by hiring local, hard working family people. They are the crew who is on set or directly involved with the production of a movie or TV. They pay income tax and spend their paychecks in the local economy. This site hopes to shine a light on who those people are. Click here to view some of the people who would be affected if the MA Film Tax Incentive went away. Movies and TV spend money in local business and it benefits the state. For example, a local pizza shop who supplies dinner for 100 + people. Thousands of dollars per production are spent in local florists, apparel shops, automotive parts, hardware stores, fabric stores, bike shops, and antique shops. There’s more: security, locations permits, printing, truck and van rental, the list goes on and on. These small businesses pay income tax and spend their paychecks in the local economy. This site hopes to shine a light on who those people are.  Click here to view some of the businesses who would be affected if the MA Film Tax Incentive went away. Movies and TV spend money on highly paid actors and executives and it benefits the state. These actors may have their primary residence in a different state, but they pay income tax in MA.   Bottom line: the more Massachusetts invests in the film industry in MA, the more money it will receive in return.  Q. Is there a study I can read on the economic impact of the MA Film Tax Incentive?  Yes: Economic Impacts of the Massachusetts Film Tax Incentive Program (http://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Economic-Impacts-of-the-Massachusetts-Film-Tax-Incentive-Program-.pdf)    Here are only a portion of the local people who work via the productions shooting in state.

boston,3copni,itsonlyastrongbuzz,3,Fri Jul 10 04:22:27 2015 UTC,"Cambridge, etc was after Brookline. Brookline stopped the train. Chelsea in 91 was broke and the state took it over. Mayor Flynn offered to let them join to bail them out (and wasn't exactly a popular idea in the city). Kind of different than the late 1800s train of annexation.  All 3 exam schools are pretty good, actually. Also, some of the new charters are also very good. The normal BPS sucks though. Neither really here or there as an excuse for Brookline to reject annexation in 1873. Busing also didn't happen until 1974, and is not really in effect now (although with closing and consolidating of the neighborhood schools its kind of moot).

boston,3copni,rellim1214,20,Thu Jul 9 16:33:59 2015 UTC,"A lot of European cities are quite small and dense. But they probably feel bigger to the people who live there, because of the strong public transportation networks that make it easy to get from the metro area to the city proper.  The one exception I can think of is London, which is absolutely massive (roughly twice the land area of NYC)."
boston,3copni,BAM521,9,Thu Jul 9 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"Paris is actually pretty massive too. It's just that the actual land inside the city limits is a small portion of what might reasonably be called Paris. Like with Boston and Cambridge, but with a stronger.  That's a criticism I have of the comparisons--they say more about the administrative structure of local government than about how big the cities actually are.  It's funny that you should mention London, because it's actually far, far, smaller than any of the cities on the list, by this pedantic definition. The formal entity known as the City of London measures just over 1 square mile, so more than 40 times smaller than Boston. Of course, that's not what people refer to when they say London."
boston,3copni,alwaysnightandday,9,Thu Jul 9 22:59:19 2015 UTC,"You're right about the differences in local government. It doesn't really matter as much how big Paris is technically, because (at least according to my understanding) so much governing occurs above the municipal level. In the U.S., we have a much stronger tradition of local control, for better or worse. Which is why you see comically wealthy towns directly next to poor cities.   The formal entity known as the City of London measures just over 1 square mile, so more than 40 times smaller than Boston. Of course, that's not what people refer to when they say London.   I think this is both technically right and technically wrong. It's something I was actually really curious about when I went to London.  London Mayor Boris Johnson and the city council govern an area of about 600 square miles and 32 boroughs that is technically referred to as ""Greater London."" It is actually a city, and it's been this way officially since 1962. This, for all intents and purposes, is London, though it happens to exclude the square mile in the middle known as the City of London, which encompasses what was once the ancient Roman city. That area is almost entirely financial businesses and has a negligible population, and is governed by the City of London Corporation, with a Lord Mayor. The ""local government"" is largely ceremonial, though it does provide some local services separate from the rest of London. Apparently, business owners, as well as residents, are allowed to vote.  Basically, there are two Londons: the big one that holds all the people, and the tiny one that stays separate for historic reasons. I don't think were have any parallels in the U.S. or anywhere else in the world, for that matter. The U.K. is just weird. But I think most people there just treat the City the way we would treat any downtown district.  What's fascinating is how in the recent past Parliament has just decided, ""well, fuck it, this is going to be London now"" and expanded the borders of Greater London to reflect its growth. When I was there last I saw headlines suggesting that they were going to do it again, which would have made the city even bigger. And to think that we can't even get Boston, Cambridge and Somerville into the same municipality."

It took me years to get comfortable with the subway system, and there are parts of my own borough where I've never been.  Entire subway lines I haven't ridden more than once or twice in almost a decade.  And the tri-state area?  Fuggetabotit.

Jumped on the subway again, got dinner in Williamsburg and headed back to our airbnb. No trip took longer than 5 subway stops and was super easy to navigate.

Millions of times a day in Boston alone are there bumps between two people, and weeks and months will go by with nothing more than a ""sorry.""

Unhealthy people don't think, don't have time to think, or think and choose poorly.  I'm not defending the woman; someone has died because of her.

It's people like them who have no impulse control, have no idea what the fuck they are doing and someone have to knock some sense into their hollow mind.

Edit: so you downvoters think that it is perfectly acceptable to kill a 73 year old for basically no reason?   Or maybe they think that the crime should be punished in a way that is appropriate given the severity.  Life in solitary is torture, plain and simple.  You're being down voted because your comment is emblematic of another problem that we have in society - the typecasting of people into ""good"" and ""bad"", not allowing for gradations, where the ""bad"" people deserve whatever punishment can be thought up without regard to the seriousness of their infraction.   Yes, murder is bad.  Was this murder?  Murder is: ""the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another.""    I highly doubt that Taj____ said ""she bumped into me, now she must die.""  Is this manslaughter? Maybe.  Manslaughter is defined as ""the crime of killing a human being without malice aforethought, or otherwise in circumstances not amounting to murder.""  Manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in MA..    When I think about myself - barely a few years older than the alleged perpetrator - and I think about spending an amount of time in jail where the amount of time is almost as long as I've been alive; an amount of time that is approximately twice as long as the time that encompasses my most vivid memories - that is a damn long time.

This woman needs major help, society didn't give it to her properly, and this is a tragedy; her brain can still be saved and she can still do good in her life, but the greater tragedy is that if she goes to solitary, we've sentenced her mind to death.

There are many shops in Boston, it is a highly competitive market here, and it sounds like you have unreasonable expectations for what you should pay for a quality bike. Bikes have to be made of strong metals and have hundreds of parts that have very high tolerances.  How much do you spend a year on T passes? Do you want a bike that lasts longer than a year before needing work? How much would you spend on gas in a month? Insurance? Maintenance? Excise tax?

boston,3cns1k,jpallan,316,Thu Jul 9 09:57:53 2015 UTC,"This was filed by the state senator. It does not mean she backs the bill.  A civics lesson that was new to me when I moved to Massachusetts.  It is common in Massachusetts for state senators to file bills at the request of their constituents. In fact, in the telegram article the globe links to, it says ""The bill (S 317) was filed by Sen. Joan Lovely at the request of a constituent from Salem""[1].  Since I don't see any statements from the senator in support of this bill, I'm inclined to believe this is merely a case of her filing as a courtesy to a constituent and give her the benefit of the doubt that she might disagree with the bill.  This tradition of legislators filing on behalf of constituents comes from Article XIX of the Massachusetts constitution, which is our right of free petition that states:  ""The people have a right, in an orderly and peaceable manner, to assemble to consult upon the common good; give instructions to their representatives, and to request of the legislative body, by the way of addresses, petitions, or remonstrances, redress of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they suffer.""[2]  So, please don't crucify a state senator for following the tradition of filing a bill on behalf of a constituent. This is a great tradition that gives us input into the political process in Massachusetts, even when our representatives disagree with us.

boston,3cns1k,frojoe27,15,Thu Jul 9 15:33:29 2015 UTC,"Of course not, and that's not true at all, at least for trades.   In MA I could do the exact same job with the exact same materials and exact same craftsmanship with the exact same permits and pass the exact same inspections, but since my hands aren't blessed by the state and/or electrical or plumbing union any work I did would have to be ripped out and replaced with the exact same (or likely lesser) materials and workmanship. Those trades charge $75-$100+ per hour, btw, so a $50 weekend project adding outlets to a room becomes a $1500+ job.  I'm fine with the vast majority of inspections and codes: I don't want some yahoo burning my neighborhood down. Some of them are a little extreme though. For instance, you need a permit to replace a sheet of drywall, and then an inspection where they count the number of screws you used per sheet. Yes, seriously. If you don't have insulation MassSave will blow it in after the drywall is up, but MA requires you insulate before you put drywall up. So you need a permit, an inspection of the insulation, after you screw the drywall on an inspection of the screws, then you can mud the screw holes and I presume there is at least one more inspection (I haven't gotten that far yet). All that just to replace some water damaged plaster.  The rest of the bureaucracy is just nuts. It took me a week and 7-9 forms (some of which only available at the office) and 4 trips to town hall and inspectional service (plus many other agencies) to do a 2-hour job sliding a lining down my chimney. Also I had to lie and say it would cost $1500 because the actual price of $479 ""seemed too low"" and the permit would be rejected. And then when I was done with all the forms they decided I didn't need a building permit after all, but a sheet metal permit, but then changed their mind again after I started to lose it. Oh, and when I first moved in I got a stop-work order, my painter sent home, and my fiancee told off, because I didn't have a permit for the tarp we put over the leak in the roof during a rain storm. Yes, you need a permit to put a tarp over a hole during a rain storm, and your painter (one of the rare trades that don't need a permit) can be sent home because of that.  /rant"

One example:   Q:  I would like to perform my own electrical work.  Can I pull a permit as a homeowner and not a licensed electrician?  A:  According to Massachusetts Electrical Code, a homeowner may perform electrical work provided that:        The work being done is residential, not commercial; and      The person performing the work is the property owner; and      The person performing the work resides at the property.

I should clarify that I was speaking from a plumbing inspection standpoint, not an electrical. I don't think you need an electrical inspection for a dishwasher?  It's one water pipe (it's not hot and cold, it's a single water intake, cold) and it's threaded and screws into the back of the dishwasher. It's super easy to do.   Sure there is a drain pipe that goes on with a simple clamp and usually just feeds into the sink drain or garbage disposal. You unclamp it and re clamp it to the new dishwasher. But the plumbing inspection is to ""inspect"" the single tiny water pipe. And that's kind of absurd that this minimal work needs a permit and to be inspected.   ETA: and uh, no vent.

This way a senator can support a constituent's rights, foster debate id needed, request law clarification, and even submit an amendment to a law for the purpose of clarification. Many times a law is passed that is too general or vague.

boston,3cojdl,BinnoNick,20,Thu Jul 9 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's really up to North End residents.  On weeknights, there is a lot of people trying to cram on to sidewalks and spilling into streets which is not safe and not very hospitable.  I think if I had a vote to do something, I would make it like a Dutch woonerf.  Limited or no parking, one way, low speed treatments, etc.  Cars aren't banned but they are clearly not the prime road users.  This would allow for delivery trucks and handicapped access but hopefully shift to a more human friendly street."
boston,3cojdl,Steltek,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:56:57 2015 UTC,"Before we call something unsafe I'd like to see some evidence that it actually is unsafe. How many pedestrians are hit by cars on Salem St? Not many that I'm aware of. Generally the pedestrians & bikes have the unofficial right of way on Salem. Even in the best of times you can't go very fast on that street, it seems to self police."
boston,3cojdl,inacave,30,Thu Jul 9 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"Disagree since its a 2 way street. But Salem Street should be pedestrian only, at least on the weekends in the summer especially."
boston,3cojdl,Spoonie-Luv,7,Thu Jul 9 14:55:09 2015 UTC,"Yep, hit the nail on the head. Hanover isn't the most (auto)-trafficked street anyways, but shutting just nudges northbound people over on to Salem. Why bother, it's not like Hanover is hurting for pedestrian, restaurant activity - pedestrianizing it wouldn't have near the quality of life gains as pedestrianizing Salem, creating a nice, calm flank street to generate a little more street action and economic/QoL benefit. 60%+ of the non-waterfront households in the North End don't own even 1 vehicle anyways (and yet the 30% that do own a car jam up every space as it is).  The argument against it I can see is: Hanover is the disneyland street, still residential but heavily geared towards the tourist/service economy. Salem St still errs to the residential side of things. Pedestrianize it, and the tourist vortex of Hanover would probably gobble it up. I think that'd be a fair complaint. I don't think it'd be a dealbreaker, but it's absolutely worth considering."
boston,3cojdl,CantabKBH,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:41:46 2015 UTC,"I live on Salem Street and don't own a car. I'm not sure I'd benefit much (if at all) from either of the streets being off-limits to car. As a pedestrian (the majority of the time) I don't find it too hard to get around, and it's nice to be able to drive right up to the door for cabs and delivery trucks and all that. I also agree that turning Salem into a pedestrian only area seems like it might make it feel even more touristy than it already is."
boston,3cojdl,user2196,7,Fri Jul 10 04:33:45 2015 UTC,"I agree on the Salem St being pedestrian only, however making Hanover one way towards the green way with parking on one side (non-parallel) would maybe add more spaces to the street and make is less congested.  Traffic free Friday noon -Sunday Midnight trash pickup and food delivery only would be one option - not sure how to enforce this (just a thought).

boston,3cojdl,Anxa,5,Thu Jul 9 17:28:55 2015 UTC,I lived on Hanover for a couple years not too long ago.

boston,3cojdl,Barrilete_Cosmico,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:12:43 2015 UTC,"It's not like these streets are major arteries, it's impossible to drive through them at more than 15 mph. Making them pedestrian would make for a better experience for residents and tourists alike and possibly boost the revenues of those businesses. Imagine if they made it pedestrian and installed outdoor restaurant seating, increasing their capacity. The city could make more revenue off sales tax and renting those outdoor areas, and it would feel far less crowded for people shopping in the area."

boston,3cojdl,itsonlyastrongbuzz,5,Fri Jul 10 08:43:07 2015 UTC,Make it cobblestone and make it one way (towards the Greenway) and eliminate parking. People would drive slower because of the cobblestones and the fact that they're coming off of a tight street instead off off Cross St. Restaurants could have outdoor seating (albeit protected by bollards or heavy planters).

boston,3cojdl,inacave,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:09:00 2015 UTC,"I advocated removing parking and making it a one way which would eliminated most of the problems, which would allow people to speed.   I don't think this will fix it, the majority of the traffic/slowdown is caused by pedestrians in some way. You have pedestrians clogging both sidewalks (just walking up and down), which causes people to dump into the road to get by. Then you have the gigantic non-moving crowds of people on the sidewalks at Mike's, Modern, various restaurants, etc. Then you have the people who just cross the street randomly and act like pedestrians have right of way. These are often 3 different unique groups, with different origins & different destinations.   Removing one lane of traffic/parking won't stop any of those, and it also will only worsen the people who pull over/double park. At any one time on Hanover there are usually 4-5 cars double parked in the high traffic zones. Then once someone slows down to navigate around the double parked person, the pedestrians use the chance to cross the road.  One of the other really silly things that would help: The traffic light @ Hanover & Parmenter is dead. It's so faded that you really can't see when oncoming traffic has the green, so people walk constantly.  It's a really fucked up area and I'm not sure there's a single silver bullet that will allow cars and peds to coexist."

You're missing literally the entire point.  The point is to make it pedestrian friendly, not help traffic flow.  The cars are the problem, the ""pedestrians"" are the tourists and visitors who are the reason the community exists.  Besides, if people knew it sucked to drive on, they'd avoid it. Simple.   The part I suggested is on the Freedom Trail. They should be looking to make it more pedestrian friendly, if only to allow people just passing through to do so without clogging the streets."

boston,3cojdl,inacave,7,Thu Jul 9 16:24:34 2015 UTC,"There are thousands, if not tens of thousands of people who make it through every single winter without a car... it's not like they'd send tow trucks to remove every car overnight, but if you stop issuing permits as people move out the parking will get lighter and lighter, and you can set a date far in the future for them to be 100% car free.  I'm not saying it's a 100% perfect solution, there are obviously reasons to have cars, but many, many, many people get through winter without a car."
boston,3cojdl,cryoshon,2,Thu Jul 9 19:00:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, most of the North End is a competition between cars and pedestrians for the use of the street since the sidewalks are so narrow.

It's not that simple. There are only 2 'problem' streets: Salem and Hanover, since they're the only 2 streets that are crazy high in pedestrian traffic and run the entire length of the North End. Many of the other streets have no other access."
boston,3cojdl,fungwah,-2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm aware. I just believe that not everyone needs to be able to drive directly up to their front door. And getting rid of the cars would be great for businesses, tourists, pedestrians, etc."

I'm all for getting rid of household vehicles in the North End except for handicapped and possibly the elderly (small, designated parking areas), but there's a ton of cab and Uber traffic, I think lack of cars would hurt businesses. Haymarket is close, but it's not adjacent."
boston,3cojdl,fungwah,0,Thu Jul 9 19:30:13 2015 UTC,"Well the Montreal model I believe allows deliveries at limited times (I think early morning, can't remember). Cabs could easily pick up on the Greenway or Commercial Street, or you leave one of Hanover/Salem open for cabs. And the ability for businesses to spread out onto the sidewalk, have a patio etc, would offset anything lost to people mad they can't drive an extra block or two.  I'm not an urban planner or anything here, just spitballing because every time I'm in the North End as a pedestrian or biker I find myself wishing there were approximately 95% less cars around there, even on the side streets."

Still on his website:  Why are we asked to sell presale tickets to local / national shows and can’t we just get a door draw?  – The reason we ask bands sell tickets is for promotional purposes. We’ve noticed since we’ve had bands sell tickets word gets out about the show. It also gives us a more direct correlation on who came out for what band. You sell tickets on local shows to get considered for national shows or future shows. The more you sell the better opportunities of getting more shows and on the national shows where the sales help us pay to bring in the bigger bands. It also helps to show them what our scene is capable of in regards to how strong of a draw the bands in this area have.  Do we have to sell tickets to get a show booked? / We can draw well at the door – can’t you tally? – No! We do shows with and without tickets.

boston,3cpjne,neogonzo,6,Tue Jul 14 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"Ok i'm goona address this issue  as a totally independent, third-party neutral; because, i've never worked with this promoter, nor do i know him personally. Nor do i even know anyone who has worked with him (i don't think).   To be honest, pay to play shows are terrible arrangements for the artist. But it's entirely the artist's fault for agreeing to perform for free.   I get that newbie acts want to be heard. And i get that the Promoter's often take a huge risk because they have to rent the venue, fill the seats, and hope to get a cut of the booze. But this particular promoter is essentially paying artists 15%-16% of net, when it should be the other way around! If the acts are so ignorant of the finances and willing to play for free, they really can't blame anyone but themselves. However, the promoter should be operating on a more honest basis and not gorge in the profits to an apparently 85% net.  FYI, my numbers are based on an act requiring to sell $300 dollars worth of tickets to earn $50 bucks = 16% ROI.  I've read on other platforms such as FB that's how he sets up his shows. IMHO, if that's the case then that's absurd. But, he's simply putting the risk on the unknown act. This practice of risk-shifting is arguably reasonable in the case of an unknown act who can't guarantee to sell the tickets. But if that's the case (that they can't sell tickets), then don't work with a promoter you can't pay, especially if you're goona have to do his job anyway.   If you owned a company, you wouldn't hire 5 employees when you could only afford 3 or 4. Especially if that one employee (i.e., the promoter) doesn't actually do his job (i.e., promote the show and sell tickets). Could you imagine if your employee came to you and said you had to pay all or most of your revenue to him so you could operate your business? You'd fire him immediately. It's no different here.   I think all these pay-to-play promoters should be removed from the industry through a simple process of nonuse. Just don't use him, or anyone else that operates this way. AND STOP PLAYING FOR FREE!  Inb4, i'm not saying bands shouldn't try to sell tickets. In today's music industry, every party needs to hustle. New acts way more so than others. But breaking into a market takes time, patience, and determination. If you wanna be improvident and impatient, you're hitting par with this guy."

You are given a choice, the terms are clear up front.  Say yes and do it.  Say no and move on.  You have a choice.  Don't like the deal? Don't take it!  Making music is fun.  Running a business isn't.  If you want to make money playing music I recommend taking on a business mentality.  Take emotion out of it.  ""What's right"" all depends on your perspective.  NEWS FLASH: the world owes you nothing.  As soon as you accept this, you'll stop getting mad at how strangers run their businesses. Go back in time and bitch slap whoever it was that told you playing music was a good way to make money.  It's the worst. Pay to play doesn't exist in the plumbing industry.  I'm sure there aren't dozens of angst ridden late teensomethings eager to stuff their hands in a shit filled toilet to unclog it.  Demand for new metal bands is near zero from a for profit venue's point of view, and supply is never ending. Anyway, I'm just sick of musicians demanding they get paid more than they're worth to the person hiring them.  I'm not saying ""musicians shouldn't get paid"" by a long shot, but until you are amazing and putting asses in seats, you don't ""deserve"" even free drinks.  If you want to make money produce something that will sell."

Take, for example, You Blew It! - whom were promised an $800 guarentee, then Rich never showed up to the show, and had to go collect their money from Rich at another show across town - only to be paid $200. What kind of promoter does this? Why even promise that much, then never show up, only to pay a band EVEN less?   Other than that, does he have an LLC? A copyright on ""Keynote Company?"" Does he pay taxes as an independent contractor? All of these are very important to consider."

boston,3cpjne,BarbarianG4,0,Tue Jul 14 20:48:04 2015 UTC,I don't see an ethically issue here. It benefits everyone to sell as many tickets as possible.

If anything, what can be taken from this article is, you can't assume that everyone in each race has the same opinion. I can't find it now, but there was another Japanese-American who wrote an article that had a fairly opposite opinion of the protest, that they didn't find it offensive. Each person has their own experience and opinion.     As stated in this article:     As earnest and well-meaning as Martha1 sounds, it’s lack of imagination, ultimately, that is the problem here, the lack of willingness to consider someone else’s position. To consider that the OK of one Japanese friend who likes your kimono doesn’t mean wholesale approval from all Japanese people, let alone Asian-Americans. Or to consider that even if an act — a harmless one like putting on a costume in front of a painting — isn’t wrong, it might not be right either.

boston,3cte9r,ch1ck3npotpi3,5,Fri Jul 10 17:19:49 2015 UTC,"Go into any station with an attendant and just ask.  Most of the big stations will just have stacks of blank CharlieCards lying around.  The people at the shuttle don't take fare off of the CharlieCard.  They just check to see if you have one.  If you don't have one, it's $5.00 and they take credit card, but it's worth it considering that Government Center is closed so you'll have to do some shenanigans to get to the Blue Line from the Green."
boston,3cte9r,orangetangerine,3,Fri Jul 10 17:23:44 2015 UTC,"Is that true, about getting a Charlie Card? That's how I've always been used to it being, but I lost mine last summer and getting a new one was awful. You had to go to one of maybe 5 designated stations, during designated hours. Have they changed it back, or is your information out of date?"
boston,3cte9r,UserNumber42,2,Fri Jul 10 18:16:14 2015 UTC,"It hasn't changed. CharlieCards are still only distributed only at certain stations at certain hours of the day.

They did restrict me to one (I was getting some for friends) although they had a GIANT stack sitting inside the information booth.  I didn't know that the policy changed so that's good to know, but I've never had a problem at a busier station getting one; if OP is going to the airport near the Back Bay shuttle, it is way easier to just walk to Back Bay from Copley (or checking with the attendants at Copley just in case if they had any extras) to get one of these cards than doing all the connections you'd need to get to the airport tbh"

Keep refreshing the RMV search page - expand your search radius to something like 50 or 100 miles and just keep hitting F5. You might want to try this at different times of the day.

boston,3ctsw4,failcookie,6,Fri Jul 10 18:44:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if I were you, I'd spend my time in appointments with realtors, looking at apartments in areas you would consider. Then you will know exactly what to expect and won't fall so deeply into the black hole of despair that unprepared people fall into when relocating here. Look at apartments, get to know just what the amount of money you can spend will get you in various neighborhoods. Ride the T around to those neighborhoods to see what they are like. Drive by in the middle of the day and late at night so you see how realistic it will be to be able to park there. Do yourself a favor and be a tourist after you move here. Use this visit to develop realistic expectations of what your budget will buy you here (and then add several hundred to that to account for prices going up between now and when you will move here)."
boston,3ctsw4,becausefrog,2,Fri Jul 10 19:14:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely aware of the cost of living on the city. We have had a few months to study some of the rentals and get a feel of what it will cost us. We are just a couple with a large enough income to sustain living in the midst of it all. At least for the first year, we may explore different suburbs afterwards to dive into our comfort zone. We really just want to do something bold and new that first year."
boston,3ctsw4,becausefrog,2,Fri Jul 10 19:45:54 2015 UTC,"Go and actually see some of these apartments, though. The cost isn't the only thing people have to get used to, it's the age and condition of the buildings, lack of amenities, and actual size that the pricetag gets you that can be a shock to people, as much as the cost.  If you can afford to live in the Back Bay, do it. It's great. You won't need a car, things are open late, and you'll experience the feel and thrill of living in the city while having minimal safety concerns and beautiful surroundings. Even if you are in a tiny basement apartment with a kitchenette and only one window that is below ground so doesn't let in any light, it won't matter as much because you can be out an about so easily there, with much to see and do, and easy access to the Esplanade when you want to relax in the fresh air."

Edit to clarify: JP = Jamaica Plain"
boston,3ctsw4,vhalros,2,Fri Jul 10 20:25:32 2015 UTC,I will add Cambridgeport to my list. I have not checked it out yet. We are debating between urban and suburban. Maybe it'll be one year in the city and then run fast for the subs if we don't like it.

Harvard Square is also a nice place to walk around. You might also enjoy walking the ""Freedom Trail"" which is just a 2.5 mile trail of historical sites (mostly Revolutionary War stuff).  There's no part of Cambridge that I would say you should avoid. Probably don't want to walk around in Dorchester at night though."
boston,3ctsw4,GoWithItGirl,3,Fri Jul 10 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"Ugh, please don't take a taxi everywhere. Traffic here sucks and it's such a walkable city with decent public transit (compared to most of America), so that will help you get a feel for it. I'm early 20s too and I literally don't know anyone with a car. Back Bay is really nice but really pricey, and sort of annoying to get to Cambridge from-- you'd have to walk to Park or MGH. There are plenty of great neighborhoods in Cambridge on the red line, so you might want to explore some of those."
boston,3ctsw4,GoWithItGirl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:23:56 2015 UTC,I will take that advice! We weren't exactly sure how big the city was. It looks massive when you are just looking at a map.

boston,3ctsw4,GoWithItGirl,4,Fri Jul 10 19:48:41 2015 UTC,"Is the company also paying for your housing? Are you aware how very expensive it is to live in the Back Bay Area? Because if not, you might want to spend some time exploring some alternate neighborhoods to live in.    Beyond that, think about what you enjoy doing for fun in Kansas and research something similar you could do here, to see if you might like it.  For instance, if in Kansas you enjoy hiking, you might want to try out some of the walking trails around Boston.  If you enjoy live music, look up a neighborhood venue and go try it out.  If you can't go a week in Kansas without ordering in X type of food, go buy X type of food from a restaurant that is highly rated in Foursquare here.  (Foursquare's ratings in my travel experiences, are far better and more accurate than Yelp's.  Anything 8 and up is generally worth your time).    I also strongly advise visiting as many neighborhoods as possible.  You'll be surprised at the very different feel each of them has.  You haven't had a real sense of Boston if you've only visited the Back Bay and Cambridge (which isn't even technically ""Boston"").  Visit the South End, the North End, Allston-Brighton, etc... You might dislike one neighborhood and really love another."
boston,3ctsw4,DaUnknownGames,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Yeah - sticker shock already surprised us. We have been studying the rentals for a couple of months now.

boston,3cpz31,thelittlebirds,14,Thu Jul 9 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"There are tons sharp people who know a lot about buying cars, some in Boston, in the cars subreddit, I think you might get more immediate help there.   That said, I'm a little ways outside the city, but if my schedule allows- I'm willing to help. I used to buy and sell a lot, and have gone through the purchase process literally dozens of times. I grew up in a small dealership and have a pretty good sense of what's good and what to avoid. How soon are you looking to buy? Do you have a budget? Do you have parking? What will be your use for the car (commute, road trips)? Feel free to PM me."
boston,3cpz31,AJ124,10,Thu Jul 9 21:24:28 2015 UTC,"I don't have time to leave the response that this question deserves, but I wanted to pop in and give you a piece of advice.  You're a college student (and on reddit), which means you probably have more free time than money on your hands. You're probably also young. If you meet these criteria, you'll benefit a lot more from a bit of education than from paying someone else to do your job for you, assuming you can even find someone you trust to do this. Most parents don't really understand the car market anyway, so don't worry, you aren't at a disadvantage.  Start by learning how cars are priced. You can use www.google.com, www.edmunds.com, www.kbb.com, or a number of other good websites. You should know what these terms mean:  MSRP  Invoice  Dealership Rebates  Dealership Incentives  and how they apply to your purchase. This helps determine the price of a car at any given state of repair/mileage. A dealership is going to try to sell to you at MSRP, but you can and should buy at below the invoice price. You can figure out why with research and those websites I linked.  Second, don't rush into any purchase, ever. Do not, under any circumstances, buy a car the first time you see it. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Anyone trying to rush you into a purchase is probably hiding something. You should diversify your search as much as possible, and visit a number of dealerships. The salesmen at these places are for the most part trying to rip you off, and they have a lot of practice doing this. Don't be afraid to stick to the price that you know is right. As long as you quote a price that still brings them a profit, then assuming your timing is right they will still accept it. Hint: This price is not MSRP, no matter what they tell you.  Third, timing. Catching a dealer at the end of whatever period he has for filling his quota will make him or her much more amenable to cutting a deal. At the start of their ""month,"" they're likely to haggle to get a better price, as they don't have a quota to meet. Look up specifics on this, as I don't have them.  Last (but certainly not least), and this is doubly important if you're buying from a private seller (Dealerships tend to handle this end rather well), make sure you ask after and acquire documentation for every service provided to the vehicle in question over the last several years, at least. You'll want to know when and where the vehicle received its 30k/60k mile service, and if it has regularly had its tires rotated and oil changed. In addition, be sure to ask to take the car to a car shop that you trust (ie: don't take their word for it) and get a standard check-up before handing over any money.  Learn how to do this once, and you'll know for the rest of your life. It will save you money, time, energy, and stress. College is the best time to do it, not when you're working a full time job juggling kids and a wife."
boston,3cpz31,Jwoot,2,Thu Jul 9 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"Also, Get quotes from insurance companies before hand, especially if you are going to finance the car. Massachusetts requires a specific amount of coverage on financed vehicles and it can get expensive. This will help you establish how much you can afford on the monthly payment. Establish hard numbers that you can stick to before going into a dealership. Your monthly payment limit, how much you can put down, and total cost for the car."

boston,3cpz31,monsieur_cacahuete,2,Thu Jul 9 21:43:41 2015 UTC,"As someone who just recently purchased a new car, I have some key points every new young car buyer should consider. I can't help with dealerships or technical car speak, but these were some things I learned in the process of buying my car.   What is your budget? Remember that isn't not only a monthly car payment but a monthly insurance payment, yearly inspections, bi-yearly car re-registration, tolls, gas, parking (consider whether the location you want to live in has non-permit parking, and note that permit parking requires changing addresses for EVERYTHING), replacing windshield wipers more than you'd think they'd need to be replaced (once a year for me so far), the occasional parking tickets (it's gonna happen, yo), etc. Do you have a co-signer? I bought a brand new Honda Civic 2013 but absolutely would not have been able to do so without my mom co-signing because her credit was significantly better than mine. I didn't have bad credit, but I hadn't been working on building mine at all so it was under the car dealership's requirement. Still, I currently pay around $186/mo on the car and $120/mo on insurance. That's over $300, on top of Boston rent... New or used? New cars require less money spent on maintenance, but do require good credit. Used cars are a gamble where you can you spend a little money on upkeep, or you can get a money pit. Insurance: Cars with better safety ratings have lower insurance rates. So although they may look similar enough, the numerous basic sedans will cost you different amounts.   I have no idea what your car needs are, but if they're not much, do consider a service like ZipCar.  I'm sure other people can be of more help, but thought I might as well throw in my two cents in the event it's actually useful. :P Good luck!"

boston,3clf6f,datadyne007,6,Wed Jul 8 23:38:45 2015 UTC,"Security got it wrong.  The tire or engine blew up.  The back end of the bus lifted off the ground and left a pile of debris on the road.   It happened a little bit before 100 Federal and after the blast, the bus rolled to a stop in front of 100 Federal.  The fire started a few minutes after the blast."

boston,3clf6f,the_captain,5,Wed Jul 8 20:50:07 2015 UTC,Wonder if it was the tires popping?
boston,3clf6f,boston_shua,3,Wed Jul 8 20:56:25 2015 UTC,"It is.  I heard stories that the engine exploded, which led to the fire.  Some of the official stories say that the tire blew out when then lead to the fire...somehow.  Given the intensity of the boom earlier, I'm inclined to believe the former."
boston,3clf6f,Kirean,3,Wed Jul 8 23:52:00 2015 UTC,"A tire explosion is far louder than any engine explosion.  Heavy duty bus tires start with an inflation pressure of 8 atmospheres (120 psi), and a brake fire would have heated the air in the tire causing the pressure to rise before ultimately the tire failed due to excessive pressure or the fire itself destroying the integrity of the tire.  There is a reason they use safety cages when inflating these tires.  Example 1  Example 2"
boston,3clf6f,ChrisSlicks,3,Thu Jul 9 15:16:16 2015 UTC,Most likely the brakes were what was on fire which blew the tire.

Have lived here since 2011, and have seen MAJOR changes for the better in the neighborhood.  There are still some unsavory characters running around, but thats just Boston.  The fact that the bus runs from Andrew to the methadone clinic on Mass Ave means that these people will likely continue to stumble around the train station area, but I rarely see them in the neighborhoods.  My wife and I run and walk in the neighborhood, and we feel generally very safe, but always do this with caution at night (like you would anywhere in the city, I think).  Crime seems to be down, and more young, working, educated people are moving in (replacing a lot of former section-8 homes/apts that were the cause of some issues).  All in all I really like it here, have seen some serious appreciation to the value of my condo, and think that things are really looking up as the area develops further.  Other things of note: *The Banshee is a seriously great neighborhood bar *If you are a runner Harborwalk is super close by *You will be in the city super quick from the Andrew T station.  And the S. End is super close by as well *Avoid the South Bay Center Stop & Shop, unless you just want to go to people watch (seriously though, it is excellent people-watching!!)  Hopefully this helps!"

I just think it was funny that this person thought they could get my grandmother, who is the kind of person who would shell out money to help a grandchild in need, to send money but have it backfire to where they almost get arrested."

He claimed his cousin was driving and couldn't go back to jail so he wanted to kill my father unless I paid $1000 dollars. It sounds far fetched but when you're in the moment and you get that call, it's easy to be overwhelmed."

The caller hung up as soon as I said that the call sounded like a scam. When I called the number back, someone from the police department answered and said that it was a known scam and they are trying to fix it."

I'll echo the TITS guy - place is a dump, super corporate, they won't have your back. But it was my first bar gig - basically taught me that I needed to find someplace else.  Clover seemed to bank a little too much on the ""we love our jobs SOOOO much, the money will work itself out!"" No tips there, and the customer base can be a little too tech-yuppie for my tastes.   All in all, barring the hot spots in town and those that just won awards in magazines, summer is slow in Boston. If all you want is fast money, probably check out the bars on Landsdowne St in Kenmore. If this is a potential career for you, I'd just go out a lot, study places, feel the vibe of the room.

I worked there for a while in college and they would do up the schedule for the week on Sunday, and then sometimes only make it provisional after Wednesday (so they could change it later). They sometimes didn't communicate when they had scheduled you at all. So basically you were on call full time for them, couldn't make any plans, but only made a bit of money.   They also schedule you for a block of time and then (depending on your position) tell you to clock out if the place isn't busy-- not that you can really just have the rest of the day. NOPE, you can only sit around the back of the restaurant or go out a bit and be back ASAP. So even though they're not paying you anything, you have to be on call for them.   As a server, they would frequently have me open the restaurant (an hour of completely unpaid work) and serve a couple customers for 5-6 hours until a game at Fenway started up and then tell me to go home and have their favorite servers actually make tips when it got busy.   They do shitty things like this with hosts, servers, and bussers. The managers are also usually high (literally). Would not recommend/10."
boston,3ck9d8,aromachief,6,Wed Jul 8 19:16:39 2015 UTC,The part about not allowing you to leave sounds highly illegal. If you are on their property or dictating where you are they MUST pay you for 100% of that time. I would report to the attorney general tbh.
boston,3ck9d8,womeninlove,2,Thu Jul 9 01:29:09 2015 UTC,"They can't force you to stay, but it looks bad and like you're walking out on the job... even though they're not actually paying you to be there."

Short schedule can be difficult to get used to, but I actually much approve of it over extended schedules.  Say you want to go to a concert in a few weeks, you can get that night off.  You don't have to think, ""Shit...wish I found out about this concert date that they just scheduled two days ago, two months ago so I could have requested the time off"", like some of your 9-5 buddies might have to.

From what I understand, having friends who work there, it is because of the location being near Fenway.  They schedule servers and bartenders so that they will be able to handle large rushes that may occur after a concert lets out or a Sox game winds down.  So while it may not make sense to have X number of servers working when there are 40 people in the restaurant...when there's 400, those employees are needed.  So they keep them around for this exact purpose.  It could be worse...at least you get to clock out, hang out in back, shoot the shit.  You could be forced to stay on duty, tending to the 1 table you're sat every 2-3hrs, thus essentially paying your employer to work for them."

One guy was working at Babson, which has one of the top MBA programs in the country.  Google tells me that Babson MBA tuition is about $40K a year.

I won't speak for Babson specifically because some schools do have great meal programs, but for the most part, many school hire a vendor like Sodexo to provide the bulk of dining program food which will more often than not be fairly mediocre.

Because they split tips and only let one person count them out you may know you've personally earned $400 but only end up with $200 (seriously where does that difference go?).

This was on a truck, my friend worked in a brick and mortar. They have a tendency to shuffle you around locations without even consulting you. Not saying OP shouldn't work there but I found it less than ideal and the upper management is kind of shitty. There is a kind of cult mentality they want you to buy into.

There are tons of them in the area, but it's not like it's a huge chain or anything.  They really want all of their employees to believe in the business, and this lends itself to a certain kind of person wanting to work there in the first place.

Figure out what their needs are, not what you think they are. Figure out who else is in the space, and why people do/don't like them.  Just the fact that you don't seem to be aware of artist managers and reps tells me you're not really that knowledgeable here.  Also: your first programming project shouldn't be something like this. Make your first project something fairly simple that is not your Big Idea. Total rewrites of something very simple are much less painless. So you can refine it. You'll learn a lot, and the Big Idea will be far easier to code.  If it takes off, you won't leave a nightmarish mess for your first professional developer (and it won't cost you a $$$$ just to have your code cleaned up to something maintainable. Just $$.)"

boston,3ckicd,aznegglover,13,Wed Jul 8 16:55:25 2015 UTC,"I work near South Station but here are my recommendations:  Als has great subs for a great price, nothing fancy but they do the basics exceedingly well, don't let a long line scare you away they move fast. Get the chicken salad, they'll have a sign saying it's best in the city and I believe it.  There's a Five Guys in DTX, can't go wrong there.  Go to Falafel King, get a Shwarma and some napkins, it's wicked good.  Definitely try Chacarero, they only make one type of sandwich, it's Chilean, it's really fucking good and filling, cash only and the small is quite enough.  Viga always has good subs, chicken parm is bomb.  Tossed makes really good salads.  Cosi is a basic go to, cant really go wrong there, salads are good, flatbreads are good and you can do a 50/50 get a small salad and a half sandwich.  Sorelle is getting a bit far but they have really good artisanal type sandwiches, their prosciutto press sandwich is incredible and I have to force myself not to get it every time.  Tons of food trucks along the greenway, I've tried a fair bit of them and never been disappointed. Keep an eye out for Tenoch, they do mexican sandwiches or burritos and they are so worth the wait. Bon Me is solid and a staple in the area. Try out any of them."

El Molino on broad street has good sandwiches but what I really love is the pastel de papas which is a Chilean shepherds pie type of dish. So, so good.   Sabroso Taqueria is really popular for some reason, I think it's decent and fast but prefer chipotle or boloco.   Case Razdora is good if you want Italian subs or pasta. The line can get long but it's totally worth it.   U&D kitchen has some good Thai food offerings at a good price for the quantity IMO.

For more authentic  the lunch specials at Taiwan Cafe and Dumpling Cafe are ~$8 and come w/rice and a daily soup (usually a broth with some meat and veg)  Many more options in Chinatown such as $4 lunch specials from New Golden Gate, Banh mis (I recommend Mei Sum Bakery), Pho options, etc."

Gourmet Dumpling house is overrated, don't wait in line, feel free to try Taiwan cafe right around the corner too. Also, Juice Bar next to the Eldo cake house I think, on Harrison ave? Insane smoothies/milkshakes. The avocado/blueberry/honeydew drinks? Real fruit man, they blend that shit up right in front of you. None of that powder. Super cheap. Chinatown is the shit. Plenty of places for Banh mi too, but I'd say walk a little further to Banh Mi House on Winter St. It's a sketch 'food court' if you could even call it that but it's super popular for a reason."

My dog nearly died this winter from Purina dog food (specifically Purina Beneful). I only found out it was the food making him sick after I read about the class action lawsuit they had against them. Purina has refused to acwkowledge any fault of their own, and the bad brand is still on shelves of grocery stores. If they had just done a recall, countless dogs in the Boston area (as well as nation wide) would not have gotten sick and possibly died.  Sorry to be a downer, but I get pretty vocal against Purina after almost losing my best friend a few months ago. I know its my own fault for not paying attention to what branch of food I was buying, but I naively assumed all dog food companies relatively cared about animals."

WMBR (88.1) has some really great shows, but the genre varies quite a bit from show to show and day to day. While most of it is quality music that's hand selected by experts of that particular genre, you're likely to tune in during a block of bluegrass or old punk records, and you wouldn't hear any new music there.   WERS (88.9) plays mostly what you'd hear on a commercial Alternative station if we had one - Passion Pit, Cold War Kids, etc.   There's a few others that can be good (WTBU, WRBB, WMFO), but you have to be in the right place to pick them up on an actual radio."

It's not the most professional in terms of DJing, but I hear stuff I have never heard before on there, its eclectic, and there's rarely a repeated song when I'm listening. If you enjoy Americana, folk, and singer-songwriter type of stuff, WUMB (91.9) is pretty awesome.

That being said, it's an awesome place to spend a day. You can lounge on the beach, take really long walks in either direction with great views, and even venture into some wooded sections up in the dunes for some change of scenery.  I would recommend maybe when you get bored from sitting at the beach to walk to the estate itself. You can't miss it, it's a giant mansion that's used for weddings and I believe is a B&B as well. You can access it from the beach but it's a bit of a hike.  Once you get in there it's all beautiful gardens, well manicured lawns, and great photo opportunities.    I believe on a Saturday you'll be paying at least $25 to park at the beach, and you better get there early. It may even be more than that if you're not a member of the Trustees of Reservations who runs Crane.  The only food is like a beach shack thing right near the parking lot, but it's sufficient. Lots of good seafood places once you get out of the Crane area.  Have fun!"

In fact, I know of two indie films that did just that and played at Sundance, SXSW and got distribution as well.    However, if you are going to have a team - sound, lights, PA's, then you are going to attract a bunch of attention.  If that is the case, you should just try to get a permit.    In fact, you would be surprised how open the MBTA is to granting a permit for something like that.  I know of several other indie filmmakers who got permission to shoot on subway platforms.    Remember this though, if you are shooting and there are lots of other passengers, you should make sure they aren't readily identifiable, because technically, if you are trying to eventually get the film out there, you will need to provide a release from those people.  In my examples of the covert filming, they were smart. One was at a mostly empty stop, and the other was at an active stop, but it was filmed in such a way that only the two actors were in focus.  The rest of the crowd just reads as people in the background."

Many kinds of records are exempt from FOIA at the federal level and from the Massachusetts Public Records Law (pages 9-30 in this summary PDF), including an explicit exemption for library records in M.G.L. c. 78 § 7:   That part of the records of a public library which reveals the identity and intellectual pursuits of a person using such library shall not be a public record as defined by clause Twenty-sixth of section seven of chapter four.   Librarians take issues related to intellectual freedom very seriously.  Most libraries only have records of what patrons currently have checked out, and not what they've checked out in the past, so that they can't be compelled to reveal that information by any court order and any hack of library systems would have limited effect.  The Globe reporter was fishing for a gotcha story about city officials and is now trying to make a story out of the fact that BPL told him that state law specifically protects all library patrons from the release of their library records, even if they're scumbag politicians."

boston,3cgl2p,limbodog,3,Wed Jul 8 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"There are a few concerns. The first is that there is a great deal of thru-traffic, which will cause traffic. While traffic is annoying in itself, the traffic also causes two more problems:  -It may be more difficult for pedestrians exiting Forest Hills Station, as there will be a wider, busier road to cross. At times of no traffic, speeding cars may make bikers and peds feel less safe  -Traffic will back up in both directions, and extends beyond just the immediate Forest Hills area. While JP community members have been vocal, Roxbury/Mattapan residents, who may be affected by the traffic backups through and past Franklin Park and that rotary, were largely left out of the process, which is obviously frustrating. Also, if traffic is backed up, people may opt to drive back streets and through people's neighborhoods, which no one wants  That's what I've gathered from it. I don't live there either, so as a passerby I like the idea of not having a looming overpass, and being able to better incorporate the greenery around it; the new plan is more visually appealing. That said, it's a major thoroughfare, and traffic planners tend to develop wide, multi-lane roads in an attempt to handle the traffic load, and forget about the surroundings or don't account for bike traffic/safety."

The re-positioning of  the road is going to make going directly east and west of the station easier without getting near cars.  Also, the work is triggering ADA improvements to the station which means a NEW HEADHOUSE for Forest Hills on the other side of the road, which is HUGE - people can come in and out of the subway without crossing the road at all."

It’s not at all surprising that this enterprising student noticed the minus signs because the way the Museum presents the Golden Ratio in its exhibit is in fact the less common — but no less accurate — way to present it,” the statement read. “It’s exciting that people around the country are talking about math and science and that, in the process, we learned something too.”  So . . . can they both be right?  Arthur Mattuck, an emeritus professor of mathematics at MIT, said yes. The two formulas are equal.

boston,3cbiy0,fermion72,4,Mon Jul 6 23:23:49 2015 UTC,My big sister used to take me sledding here when I was a tyke.  I'm 50.
boston,3cbiy0,burzmali,2,Tue Jul 7 03:35:17 2015 UTC,"This is the most special place in the entire world to me.   My father taught me my ABC's running down those Hills as a toddler, then marching back up to do it all over again and tire me out so I'd nap the afternoon away. We used to sled here every snowy day, the best sledding in Boston, hands down.   I'm not even sure if the rink opens anymore, but he used to sharpen skates there, way back in the day.   Serious nostalgia trip man."
boston,3cbiy0,Compoundwyrds,2,Tue Jul 7 12:39:55 2015 UTC,"I love this place.  Ever since I spent the last few months binging on Top Gear I've really wanted to go to some of their auto shows, but my schedule hasn't permitted it yet.  It's also a fantastic place to bring your dog, but sadly part of the Brookline Green Dog licensing program so I can't take mine there off leash, unfortunately."
boston,3cbiy0,orangetangerine,2,Mon Jul 6 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"I loved ice skating there as a kid. There's also a nice playground, still."

boston,3cbiy0,thareal32,-1,Tue Jul 7 02:22:00 2015 UTC,"Be careful about posting ""hidden gems"". 5 years ago I could go to the Middlesex Fells sheepfold on a weekend at 1pm and find parking very easily.  Nowadays they added about 16 parking spots and you still can't get a spot unless you show up before 10:30am.  Overrun."
boston,3cbiy0,guimontag,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:05:16 2015 UTC,"The sheepfold parking lot, specifically.  There are other places to park but it's the most convenient place for me to embark from for the Mountain Bike Loop."

boston,3cg9p4,cydonia90,7,Tue Jul 7 18:34:08 2015 UTC,I can say with firm confidence that Zippy is the WORST comic of all time.
boston,3cg9p4,Vodelhaus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"For real, I used to think the same thing... in fact it would make me ill to even look at a Zippy comic, like it's so gross. But now I kind of appreciate the fact that major papers carry this weirdo avant garde Frisco Freakout holdover to this day. I still hate it but the fact that the dude literally writes whatever nonsense he's feeling and then millions of people see it is p neat. Like tons of other ""how is that even art"" styles, Zippy is terrible at face value but as a concept and context in which it exists is incredibly cool."
boston,3cg9p4,VOMIT_WIFE_FROM_HELL,6,Wed Jul 8 05:07:52 2015 UTC,Because rich people are parking their money in urban real estate and don't give a fuck whether the land actually gets used.
