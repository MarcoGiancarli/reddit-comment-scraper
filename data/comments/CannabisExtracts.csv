CannabisExtracts,3e47wx,TwStDoNe,5,Tue Jul 21 21:57:12 2015 UTC,That is only a single heat source. The D-nail has 2 heated plates. All of these sublimation machines will look the same though.
CannabisExtracts,3e47wx,LED_oneshot,2,Tue Jul 21 23:12:43 2015 UTC,"Too small to say its a whole new machine, too big of a difference to ignore.   Imo d-nail did this right and didn't over price the shit out of it.  For the price and the brand I think this is fair and should sell a bunch."

CannabisExtracts,3e47wx,ImaginarySpider,8,Tue Jul 21 22:45:01 2015 UTC,$335 seems fair

There will be a better warranty and probably better specs in the next few releases, but I'd love to see or hear some actual experiences with this machine.   Overall, looks promising and at a surprisingly decent price."
CannabisExtracts,3e47wx,jgreen34,4,Tue Jul 21 22:05:33 2015 UTC,GIMIDO also has a pneumatic one coming out next month for $2k-2500  I wonder about the pressure with these ones as they are just manually operated by hand. They don't mention how much it can press.

CannabisExtracts,3e47wx,KushAlien,3,Tue Jul 21 23:20:47 2015 UTC,I think the idea is that this is the highest quality solventless rosin experience you can get coupled with the whole e-nail aspect.

CannabisExtracts,3dyydb,nmanjee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:12:55 2015 UTC,"Basically...  Get a 8"" x 8"" piece of parchment paper, fold it in half. Place your bud in the tea bag and insert that flush up against the fold in the parchment paper.  Make sure to fold the edges of the parchment paper so that you essentially create an ""envelope"" that the tea bag will be housed in. Squish that with a flat hair straightener and make sure to play around with your temps. Definitely want to make sure to wear a heat glove ( not an oven mitt as these do not shield your hand sufficiently enough - I bought a glove from amazon that was made specifically for hair straighteners) so that you don't burn your palms while pressing the hair straightener together. Repeat the steps above 2 or 3 times per tea bag and you're set. Hope this helps, there's also a ton of youtube videos that you can watch if you are more of a visual learner.

I haven't tried using trim or ground herb but from all of the research that I've done, you will want to start with fresh nugs first. You're only going to get around a 20% yield no matter how good your technique is so trim most likely will not give you that much of a yield. It all goes back to...""Put good in, get good out.""  If you want to make rosin out of bubble hash you MUST have a tea bag or some sort of mesh material so that you can separate the plant pollen/organic material from the extract."
CannabisExtracts,3dyydb,l1100,0,Tue Jul 21 19:00:03 2015 UTC,The key is temp around 300 and pressure.  I know Cuban Grower uses Dewalt trigger clamps to produce the pressure.

They then add a terpenoid profile (natural or not). In all reality, clear can be made from garbage materials and usually is. Don't forget it's also decarboxylated THC so the effects aren't as long.

What kind of extraction process does that require, do they Butane or Co2 or solvent free extraction?   I am not going to waste my money based on this info, it also sounds like there is not a CBD or terpene profile that, for at least me, seems to enhance and prolong the effects of the THC, especially when it comes to pain."
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,nakdamink,7,Mon Jul 20 17:50:19 2015 UTC,Yes.  Depends on the extraction company. Originally ethanol was used. The end product will test out as solvent less.

CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,thinkharderr,3,Tue Jul 21 02:02:28 2015 UTC,As I mentioned above in a fairly obviously manor. That it's is similar to to reclaim in the fact that it is decarbed and activated. Also the lack of a full cannabinoid profile has in my experience been in correlation to a faster metabolism of the THCA.
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,thinkharderr,3,Tue Jul 21 03:51:28 2015 UTC,"Not the greatest job at quoting my comment... The line in my comment read ""reclaim-impurities+flavor=clear"". I was comparing reclaim without impurities and added flavor is practically the same as clear; due to the fact that they are both just THCA and nothing more when it comes to a cannabinoid profile. However, since you couldn't even quote me correctly me; I'm not to horrible threatened by you're incomparable and vast knowledge of both concentrates and my comments. tl,dr: you're wrong."

Also, You're wrong actually since clear isn't thc-a. If you are going to call me out, at least get that right. It's decarboxylated.   I have 99% THC-A powder without any other cannabinoids and it is different than clear at around 80% THC as far as the entourage effect.  Talking without knowing much? http://sclabs.com/sample-detail.html?id=63979  Wow cbd and cbn along with high thc.  It's fine you think its like reclaim because it is decarbed, but other than that, its nothing like reclaim  Good day and farewell"

It's one thing if you don't find benefit from this particular medicine, but talking it down and saying things that are blatantly incorrect is another. It's good medicine for people that use high thc oils.   You can put on your resume how good at mocking people you are. But we know that's a lie. It's ok to fudge the details, since you are so good at it. You had nothing worth while to say, so you resort to mockery.

CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,AlmightyNeckbeardo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:36 2015 UTC,The thc in normal oil decarbs the second it hits the nail...
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,DiggingforPoon,5,Mon Jul 20 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"It is a ""solvent-free"" extract that is fully decarboxylized (so you can dab or ingest it), but the extraction process (best guesses are that they use a Super-critical extraction process using temp/pressure) removes/destroys the terpenes, so they add some back in afterwards on the flavored varieties. The problem is that this makes a lot of them taste very similar, but they do tend to test out with high percentage levels of THC..."
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,spacedust_handcuffs,4,Tue Jul 21 19:22:36 2015 UTC,So it basically just gets you high and that's it? None of the other benefits since there is no CBD/CBN etc? I don't understand the huge demand for this stuff. I think I will just stick with my shatter.
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,spacedust_handcuffs,6,Mon Jul 20 17:49:27 2015 UTC,"It's purged to be qualified as Solvent-free, so fans usually find it smokes smoother. However I find it has a strange after taste.   Basically, if you've only had access to trim shatter/crumble or nothing super top shelf, you'll think The Clear is very interesting. However top shelf nug run wax will always be better."
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,l1100,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I pretty much only get top shelf. Not trying to brag, I was just one of the lucky ones who worked with a guy who got into the extraction business and go the friend price."
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,l1100,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:16 2015 UTC,"Good for you. I also usually just smoke nug run (I blast my own on the weekends but I enjoy Prime, Bamf, Moxie, etc). I think really the people who benefit from The Clear would be ones who have trouble smoking/dabbing if it's too hard on the lungs. But I'm pretty sure they don't use nug run material.   Also there's really only so many terps you can add to wax that works. So everything after awhile starts to taste citrus or menthol."
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,djmoans,3,Mon Jul 20 20:51:58 2015 UTC,"Dont quote me on this but here goes....  I got ahold of some of this stuff from a delivery service ( 1g of Tangie and 1g of Pear Herer ) here in Seattle last week and I started doing a little digging. The flavor is awesome but I didn't get the feeling that this was all it was cracked up to be. Apparently the thc is extracted using steam distillation and then terps ( food grade, organic based terps ) are added to the final product to add the flavor back in.  I do not think ( but have zero proof to back my claim ) that TheClear or any of the other clear looking concentrates are fully solvent free. If you are looking for solventless meds, try dry sift, ice wax, etc... Invest in a Silicon Carbide nail or a Sapphire insert for an e-nail and have at it.  I'm sure there is someone with a lot more knowlege of the product(s) in here so I'm looking forward to reading more about other experiences with clear concentrates..."

CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,mydogwalter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:53:45 2015 UTC,"Apparently food grade terpenes ( it appears that there are well over 20,000 different terpenes ) have been added to food and other products for years now. The FDA has some interesting literature about terpenes and what is considered ""healthy for human consumption.""  Edit:  Here's a link:  http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.280  High Times ( not the most reliable source ) had a great write up called: ""Talking Terpenes"", give it a read:  http://www.hightimes.com/read/talking-terpenes  Something tells me that terps have been added to tobacco for years now for flavors/aromatic enhancements. I don't think that I'm going to be seeking out TheClear stuff anytime soon. It was mighty tasty but I didn't get that feeling that I'm used to when I have a really fire batch of live resin or nug run bho. Glad to be a part of the conversation, I'm sure this topic will be popping up more and more now that folks are starting to become more aware and conscious about the stuff that they put into their bodies.

CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,PandasPantorum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:31 2015 UTC,"Are they the exact same chemical though? I am just concerned about people ingesting/vaporizing chemicals that aren't meant to be consumed orally. I know these chemicals exist within most extracts already, but adding them after might cause different chemical bonds or something, I am no chemist so just going off my instincts.   My normal supply is nug/larf run BHO and it's cheaper than I can get this stuff for, I think I will just stick with what I normally get and maybe try this down the line if the price is right just for kicks. I don't htink I will get the same medicinal benefits anyway."
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,sanhozay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:00 2015 UTC,Terpenes are present in your oil weed lemons oranges lines peaches. They get readded to these trates for flavor but no need to get excited food grade organic terp oils are the same d limonene from a lime and your shatter and a orange will have the same effect that d limonene always has. I haven't seen a test result for any Solventless that was over 77%  It's all good stuff and tasty but quality trusted bho will ways be higher. For a terpy end product find the right strain to bho/pho ratio
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,sanhozay,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"Very true, I've been reading up on the d limonene and it seems like we have yet another new technique called LHO now! Bubble Man says ( and I'm sure that we all know who Marcus is in this thread ) that a friend of his, Horatio Delbert, has just started extracting Hash with orange Terpenes. Apparently the orange terpene is a solvent???   I hate using all of these other forums as sources but it's about as good as I can get right now. Check out this convo that I just found:  http://www.tokecity.com/forums/showthread.php?52285-Bubbleman-talks-about-his-friend-Makin-LHO-(extracting-Hash-with-orange-Terpenes!)

CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,PandasPantorum,3,Mon Jul 20 19:01:38 2015 UTC,"Why do you prefer it over wax, and out of curiosity, how old are you? I see it mostly popular with the college aged crowd."
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,l1100,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:42:48 2015 UTC,"First off, it is way more potent than wax. I have had batch of raw clear that was supposedly tested at 98% thc. Also, it has been cleaned out very well of the wax's fats and lipids. A lot of my friends talked shit about clear until i gave them a dab of it. another plus for me is that I live in the same area which The Clear Concentrate is made and have been a customer of their for years now, so I got to watch them grow from a small company which only served locally to this big company which is starting to get around the country. A lot of people will tell you clear is made with bad quality buds when reality it isnt. I have heard tons of claims of this and have NEVER once seen any proof of this. Also, i just love the flavors. People think the terpenes they add into the clear are really bad for you, they think its unnatural. What they dont know is that these flavors ARE actually natural and have been created by a steam distillation process, the same way the THC is extracted from the plant. And yes I happen to be in my 20's."
CannabisExtracts,3dywr2,PandasPantorum,3,Tue Jul 21 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"I think more potent is subjective considering it's THC only and does not have any CBD. Sounds like you must work for them, or just have a strange affliction to their products."

If it was then we wouldn't have all these dumb extract artist names or stupid ass headshops names. Even Illuzion Gallery in Denver is a stupid fucking store name but the cannabis community is typically less educated and less mature so that's what you get.  Cannabis will not be a high end product like cigars or wine or art for a few more years because of the immaturity in the community, and worse, the stupidity. You can't run a culture into the ground that hasn't left ground level."

So if wear these button downs and pants because I'm 25 and when we hang out with people and smoke, I get treated like some fake yuppie, when the stoner kid with his torn up jeans can't even tell me what terpenoids are or he can't shut up about his ""fire ass"" tane soup. I want to smoke weed and be normal and just buy good concentrates based on the strains they were produced from. Instead I gotta keep dealing with scummy people in a black market and even the legal states still have to put up with the immature shit. Sorry for venting. I wholly concur with you now."
CannabisExtracts,3dw8qf,benthejammin,2,Mon Jul 20 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"No worries. Basically we are becoming real adults in 2015. You know? Age of majority might be 18 but a lot of growing up occurs in the decade after that.   Warning: opinions incoming:   There are a fuck ton of people in their mid to late 20s that refuse to age out of the shit they would normally have to age out of in order to get real jobs, etc. The cannabis industry is allowing a lot of people to do what they want and not conform to a more rigid or traditional idea of what success is.. I think in part that's great but most of the people I know doing it or see doing it are blowing it.   Being across state lines from CA into CO and being a vendor at the cannabis cup and being weed famous is dope. Doing that and selling 120/g concentrates out of your booth is fucking shady. That's just being a drug dealer. Same thing with having an extract ""company"" but also back-dooring lbs of errl. Same thing with having a clothing company but importing more than clothes from CA -> midwest.  It's weird being around shit like the cup or 710, etc. because it's a mix of wooks and juggalos and drug dealers and adults that dress like children.   I'm all for having style.. whatever that might be.. but IMO a lot of the contemporary weed culture style is caught up in some corny / flashy / trashy vibe. And it kind of permeates lots of stuff. It's part dick measuring contest part excessive dabbing part professional networking part party. Maybe that's a good thing and I'm just losing touch.   I'm enjoying living in a medical state because it's a little less of an edgy badge of cultural honor to be a stoner. There are lots of 'heady' or wook type kids out here but there are also a lot of cool professional people that work in the industry or ancillary services industries.   I'm hoping to maybe do cannabis law if I can actually find a job. ""Professional stoner"" for real not on some youtube customgrow420 basement dweller type shit."

Many of the young professionals I know are engineers and they love pot but can't smoke because of work or cannot stand interacting with the type of person that sells drugs.

CannabisExtracts,3dsc2y,MF_Mood,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:27:03 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I think you should re-read all those articles.  1st and foremost, hemp oil =/= CBD oil. Hemp and hemp oil contain CBD, as well as CBN, CBG, CBC, and many more cannabinoids. What the Stanleys brothers have done is bred a hemp plant for high profiles of certain cannabinoids. This is not magic, or voodoo, it's literally the opposite of breeding for just THC. They take this hemp plant and produce high quality CW brand HEMP oil. This Charlotte's Web hemp oil contains an array of cannabinoids, NOT just CBD.  The PureAnalytics article definitly talks about the synergistic benefits of THC and CBD together. It says the effects can be enhanced and prolonged, but nowhere in there does it say they are exclusive to taking a combination of THC and CBD.   Like the 3rd article says, there is little to no doubt (but still no scientific proof) that there are synergistic benefits when taking all the compounds present in cannabis together. This article, The Entourage Effect, talks about Marinol, which is the brand name for synthetic THC, and only THC. Nowhere in the article does it talk about isolated CBD, CBN, or any other isolated cannabinoid for that matter.  It sounds to me like someone also interpreted these articles wrong and then went to Westword with their opinion, as many people do."

Maybe it's 50% when you exclude terpenes but that's still a lot of extra (and possibly harmful) compounds you're inhaling compared to BHO or rosin.

I know some CO2 makers here have always had consistently clear high purity results but I know nothing about the process other than that there is a way to avoid having to winterize. Everyone selling Co2 like this in the bay is selling stuff that doesn't have any flavor either. The potency is ilke 30-50% and it always tastes like fucking cooking oil because it's so full of fats/waxes and other crap. Even if it did taste nice I still wouldn't dab it because said waxes tend to give me bronchitis since I have asthma and can't push the gunk out the same as a normal person.   With all that said, at least producers like OPs are producing CO2 that has fucking flavor now.

CannabisExtracts,3du3a7,Faxon,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:34 2015 UTC,"Well pressure wise a propane tank is rated for 240 psi with a burst test rating at something a bit over 900 psi. CO2 is much higher pressure as you can see by the tank rating. Pressure wise you should be okay.  However I don't know if propane and CO2 will react at those pressures. At atmospheric pressure they wouldn't react but at 200+ psi I lack the chemistry background to have any clue.  Maybe ask /r/chemistry if there is any sort of possible CO2/propane reactions. It should stay below the 300 psi range with propane however the relief valve won't go off until that 3000 psi+ rating which means it could possibly get that high of pressure inside from say the sun or a hot car.  One thing to be aware of, these tanks are not made of steel and thus do not last forever however they only pressure test them after 5 years or after visible wear. I would say toss it after a few years just to be safe if you did do this but they aren't overly expensive anyways.  Also, im not sure if your threads will match up with any propane devices or hookups which may be a problem. You might have to order parts to make up an adapter.

Further, the tank will not be at a vacuum, because those tanks can't hold a vacuum without a manifold attached to the Air Source Adapter and quick disconnect. The atmospheric gasses in the tank contain oxygen, which with propane explode when pressurized enough.

Cookiessf has a lot of cheap meh stuff and a lot of expensive awesome stuff. 1944 has a large selection but doesn't include tax in donations. They make up for it by having rotating weedmaps deals for 25% off certain brands. Medithrive carries great brands but smaller selection. Medithrive also gives 20% off entire order if you order between 10pm-1(or 2)am. I don't too much but if you go downtown, green door and barbarycoast. Good luck!"

CannabisExtracts,3do26y,Chronuc,3,Sat Jul 18 01:25:47 2015 UTC,yup that nail would do that... The metal expands when it heats up and that expansion pushes on the female glass joint on the rig and it pops it. This is why most rigs use male joints and you use a nail that fits over the joint not in it so that the metal doesn't expand into the glass.
CannabisExtracts,3do26y,Chronuc,2,Sat Jul 18 16:56:43 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. Definitely won't make the same mistake again. I feel like the owner didn't know what they were talking about. But you live, you learn. Thank you for your input!"
CannabisExtracts,3do26y,Chronuc,2,Sat Jul 18 17:34:21 2015 UTC,Male or female? I had a China TI nail that was reversae for all sizes. But putting into a female joint would break the glass. Heat would expand I guess. Broke a nexus and a female to female joint I had. Never seen it happen to a female nail. ( one that goes over the joint not in it.
CannabisExtracts,3do26y,KushAlien,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:17:01 2015 UTC,Female.  The TI nail sat in the joint. We specifically asked about that before we bought anything and were told that it wouldn't be an issue. Seems like they were wrong.  Thanks for you reply!

I'm kind of sketched out by the nail we have now considering what happened."
CannabisExtracts,3do26y,crypticsmellofit,2,Fri Jul 17 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"The nail I had was the 6 in 1. Could fit 10 14 18 male or female. With a drop down I just put the nail on top, honestly you can get one 10 20 bucks off eBay. The nail worked fine when it was on top of the joint..but wasn't the tightest fit, the reclaim dropped on the outside of the piece instead of into the drop down.  So I don't really use it too often, just search what drop down you need. Whether it's male to male. Or female to mail. Just search size and names. Or in your head shop should t be but 20-40 bucks depending on brand. Worthwhile purchase as it protects the piece and gives you a reclaim collecter and even adds a little drag."

You can QWISO your abv and it will be a dark runny oil that tastes worse than reclaim/claim built up from vaping. You could water cure your abv, THEN qwiso (not sure how much better the result would be... but make sure you dry out completely before qwiso or the water cure will be for nothing. The best method would probably be an iso/ethanol extraction that is then further cleaned with a hexane wash.  I would avoid all that though and just make coconut oil out of it for edibles :)"

There's no definitive answer as to why this happens, but there are some plausible explanations. One of these that I personally find reasonable is that marijuana makes food consumption itself more enjoyable and satisfying. In other words, you get used to a higher level of satisfaction from eating while high, and once this becomes the standard, ""normal eating"" loses appeal. This may just be one part of it, nonetheless marijuana users on average have a lower BMI than our non-blazin counterparts."

CannabisExtracts,3dkwtm,kryptobs2000,2,Fri Jul 17 02:36:00 2015 UTC,"An empty jar with a flixible lid can do that because of the change in barometric pressure in the room from the time you closed the jar to the time you opened the jar.  For example: say you close the jar when barometric pressure is low. Then barometric pressure goes up. The lid of the jar will sink in because the air in the jar is of lower pressure than the air outside.   Then when you open the jar the air may ""rush"" out because it was being compressed.  Edit: here's a kids science video explaining this principle. https://youtu.be/ah8F-xmvB2k"
CannabisExtracts,3dkwtm,SuchWastedPotential,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:11:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I figured it was pressure change related, but why would jars of bud not do this where as hash does? Is it just because the hash takes up more space and has more total moisture/mass so it happens faster? Bud does do it I guess, but it takes longer and it's maybe 1/10th the outgassing of this."

CannabisExtracts,3dj4l8,benthejammin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:11:13 2015 UTC,Both buds and kief. Bud around 300 and kief depends on strain. The lower the more potent and shattery. Arbor Press and hotplates

CannabisExtracts,3der45,murfman713,3,Wed Jul 15 18:22:46 2015 UTC,Ok so I forget what it's called. But basically it spins fast breaks down cell walls and mixes the two pefectly. Otherwise good luck sorting out the separation issue with SOME extracts. I know a not really close friend has his perfect. But he won't answer me on Facebook and trying to hear him explain it at a drum and bass show was no help.   Are you using a big boy vape or a disposable cart one like ecig ones. The small ones need a decarb to activate it I heard. Which is probably why there co2 oil carts most often. (For my area). Or the cheaper black oil ones that don't work.   Expect to loose some on your first run. If your paying top dollar I would advise against it. The syringe doesn't clear fully. It is hard to draw it up and then push air out without shooting it. You gotta suck it up 3/4 of the way then flip it upside down then pull the other 1/4 to pull air in. Then plunge it back up. Watch your thumb pressure it will feel right then shoot everywhere the next second. Keep it steady.
CannabisExtracts,3der45,boredjim8,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:38:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the pointers, i am using a Atlantis tank which the vape people call sub ohms or something.   as for preserving it in a syringe im not too worried about losing a little, i was more concerned with the mix and being able to add it to E-Liquid because i want to be able to puff on it for awhile without getting blasted off one hit.  my tank: http://www.aspirecig.com/products/Atlantis/atlantis199.html"
CannabisExtracts,3der45,SativaSprunger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:22:20 2015 UTC,Mixed at 1:1 a single hit will not get you blasted unless you take a BIG hit or have a very low tolerance.
CannabisExtracts,3der45,SativaSprunger,2,Wed Jul 15 19:38:59 2015 UTC,"Follow the directions on the bottle of EJMix and you should end up with a liquid that works fine in just about any atomizer/clearomizer.  I've been filling up a Kanger Aerotank mini and it works like a champ.  The long-term issue I've been having is that the liquid slowly darkens and thickens in the tank over time.  It doesn't happen if the tank sits full but unused, it's definitely some interaction between the liquid and the coil.  You can see the dark liquid coming back into the tank from the holes where it is wicked into the coil.  Near the bottom of the tank (last 10-15%) the liquid finally gets thick enough to not wick well, and there appears to be a change in taste (for the worse).  I've done extract/EJMix batches in 1:1, 1:1.5, and 1:1.75.  In the last 1:1.75 batch I mixed in some Suicide Bunny nicotine-free ecig juice as well.  This added some flavor, but didn't eliminate the problem I mentioned above and just diluted the mix, requiring more hits for the same effect.  I recommend using just the EJMix at 1:1, use the smallest tank you can find, and don't fill it all the way.  Don't plan on topping off the tank as you go, mixing fresh in with the thick/dark old juice just results in the new mix getting thick/dark faster.  Honestly, I can't see a single thing useful in the comments provide by /u/boredjib8.  Just don't even bother reading those."
CannabisExtracts,3der45,SativaSprunger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:30:30 2015 UTC,Thank you very much for the feedback. unfortunately my tank is anything but small. Will this cause a problem? I will take your advise and go 1:1 with my first batch. Will of .5 crumble be too small an amount to mix 1:1 considering the size of my tank? I just don't want to make too large of a batch for my first attempt.  How well did the ecig juice mix with your batch? no separation? I ask this because i would spike the small dose with ecig juice in the event of my batch being too small for the tank as a space filler. At least in that case i could get slowly yet steadily baked over vaping a tank of ecig juice.  my tank: http://www.aspirecig.com/products/Atlantis/atlantis199.html
CannabisExtracts,3der45,mmjpatient0912,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll have any problem with the larger tank.  So long as the holes for the coil inside the tank are covered you shouldn't have a problem with leaking.  Some amount of the end of the tank will be ""wasted"", my thinking is that a smaller tank minimizes this amount.  Absolutely zero separation when using just extract and EJMix.  I would advise using just EJMix and extract for your first batch.  That will give you a baseline and you can experiment from there later.  When I added the ecig juice there was some degree of separation and I'll not be adding it in the future.  I'm going to try going even smaller with my next tank.  These small tanks are only .5ml and cost about the same as a replacement coil for the Kanger Aerotank mini.  Be sure to report back with your results!"
CannabisExtracts,3der45,boredjim8,2,Wed Jul 15 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"I've made several batches and I've reviewed the comments in this thread.  /u/SativaSprunger's comment's are spot on.  Shot glass in a water bath with ejmix and the concentrate until it's mixed.  I use Atlantis V2 tanks and I've had good success, as opposed to the Subtank Mini that I can't get to wick.    I usually make 3ml batches - 1.5g concentrate and 1.5ml of ejmix. Trying to make smaller batches has a much larger loss to efficiency.  I would estimate that I lose at least 0.3ml of the 3ml batch before the first vape.  If you're trying to make a 1 ml batch, I would be surprised if you get more than 0.7ml into the tank, particularly on your first run.  It would be a lot easier with a bigger batch.  Good luck.  Let us know how it goes."

CannabisExtracts,3der45,SativaSprunger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:41:39 2015 UTC,I didn't mind the flavor but my co2 oil separated from the ejmix after a day of sitting. You can leave it in warm car and mix it a little. Maybe if I poked it but it's not great.   Also recommend not pouring it into ecig until you are sure of the consistency. I recommend leaving it in the syringe for a day to see. That way you could easily put it in a bag in hot water and retry to shake it up.   Also warm up the bottle if you can lightly. Maybe run under hot water. When it hits the oil it's cold and ducks it up.
CannabisExtracts,3der45,boredjim8,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"So just to be clear, you recommend heating up the E-liquid bottle before adding it to the mix? Im just worried that all the THC mix is going to sit atop the E-liquid and clump up. The opportune mix for me would be E-liquiod that gets me stoned over time. I enjoy the act of vaping and controlling my dose instead of 1 or 2 extremely potent extract hits."
CannabisExtracts,3der45,boredjim8,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:28:52 2015 UTC,"I mix in a shot glass, sitting in a warm water bath.  The temperature of the mix never gets over 120F.  I put the EJMix in first, drop in the extract, let it sit for a minute or two and then start stirring with the end of the blunt-tipped 3ml syringe and continue until it's homogenous.  Take it out of the warm water bath, return to room temperature and then pull it up in the syringe for dispensing in the tank and/or storage."

Dry ice to chill solvent is definitely the word of the day, along with freezing material and dewaxing chambers. Bizzybee999 uses 600 lbs of dry ice weekly, for example.  Running subzero butane reduces its ability to pick up chlorophyll and waxes, resulting in a much lighter product in my experience  It can run much more slowly, but unless it warms up, I have not noticed darker material because of this."

CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,sneakywill,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:32:05 2015 UTC,"Hey, I've been experimenting with reclaiming ethanol but not having much luck. My last attempt pulled the EtOH vapour through a watet jacketed condenser column (reflux column with a gas inlet at the top) and into an Erlenmeyer flask with vacuum take off. Evaporation of 100ml took a couple of hours in a 60*C sand bath, but I only saw a few drops of condensate forming, and they were lost since they can reevaporate from the flask under vacuum during the long process.  I would like to avoid a cryogenic cold finger or a rotavap so I was thinking of ways to siphon off the condensate. Pressure equalizing funnel perhaps? Then I could use a lower temperature for a longer period of time.  I tried the process sans vacuum but it was slow and I had a problem with the mixture bumping. I am of course aware that all the ethanol I was trying to reclaim went out the pump's exhaust!  Namaste."

CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,Endziel,2,Wed Jul 15 00:52:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry. I didn't mean to put the ""?""   Dewaxing is a general term. Winterizing is the process of removing the ""waxes"" (in this case it's the plant particulates) from the oil.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterization_of_oil"
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,Mattspyro,2,Wed Jul 15 01:00:35 2015 UTC,"Everyone in the industry knows this. Dewaxing is used as a differentiating term to indicate that a single solvent was used. Traditionally winterization is a secondary step done after extraction but before final packaging, meaning that the product was already purged once before being dissolved into ethanol. This decreases the terpene content and also can damage the flavor (especially since ethanol is much harder to purge off than butane). Everybody in the industry refers to them as different things because one uses a second solvent and a buchners funnel, while the other uses dry ice and sub zero temperatures so you can filter the butane directly without it boiling off. The difference in the product is readily apparent if you were to compare the two side by side."
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,Faxon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm not in the industry. Just interested in the topic and have a chemistry background. It seems we has a miscommunication. What exactly is the sub-zero extraction process?"
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,Mattspyro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"This guy is correct (as is another guy bellow this) and they are both being downvoted. Single solvent dewaxing is different from winterizing because the quality of the product is different if you use a single solvent vs going to ethanol. People want to know the difference when they buy products, which is why some specifically advertize that it was dewaxed. Every professional I've talked to refers to it this way"
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,Faxon,7,Wed Jul 15 20:57:06 2015 UTC,Its still got tons of butane left in it. Its chilled on dry ice for a few hours while the fats/waxes coagulate into one solid mass. Then its filtered through a buchner funnel and poured onto ptfe paper (what you see here)
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,707Guy,4,Tue Jul 14 23:42:45 2015 UTC,it does not have butane in it unless it was not allowed to purge first before putting the ethanol solution in the freezer. Ie there is only butane in it if it was made incorrectly.
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,goalzy,2,Wed Jul 15 15:30:11 2015 UTC,Ahh I see what you are saying. My apologies for jumping the gun. I assumed dewaxing was mostly done through winterizing. Haven't heard of this for BHO.
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,Mattspyro,4,Wed Jul 15 00:19:19 2015 UTC,"Winterizing does dewax your oil but winterizing requires a secondary solvent whereas dewaxing is done with a single solvent and the defining characteristic between the two terms. Generally winterized oil is more potent and pure, but lacking in flavor."
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,707Guy,2,Wed Jul 15 06:08:48 2015 UTC,"Unless you can winterize in your first solution, for example if you were to do an ethanol extraction you wouldn't need another solvent to winterize."
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,GrandmaFuxAlot,2,Wed Jul 15 14:54:19 2015 UTC,If this is coming out of the rotovape (which it looks like) i doubt it has any butane in it at all. Correct me if i'm wrong.

CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,abdeluna,5,Tue Jul 14 22:31:18 2015 UTC,Dewaxed oil is BHO that has been processed to remove any leftover plant contaminates.   More information can be found here:  http://skunkpharmresearch.com/getting-the-green-and-waxes-out-afterwards/
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,Mattspyro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:59:59 2015 UTC,Oil coming out of the closed loop system I guess with a dewaxing column poured still cold into a pan lined with PTFE/Teflon sheeting so its nonstick. This will be evaporated into BHO Im guessing.
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,benthejammin,2,Tue Jul 14 22:55:39 2015 UTC,"Not exactly, the oil from the original extraction is solubilized in in some solvent usually ethanol and then cooled so that the oil precipitates out leaving the leftover plant matter in the solvent. This ""cleans"" the oil."
CannabisExtracts,3db4nf,Mattspyro,2,Tue Jul 14 23:02:59 2015 UTC,Othet way round. Low temperature results on reduced solubility of polar molecules. Lipids coagulate and can then be filtered out. The ethanol solvent is saved and the filter cake diaposed of. Evaporate the solvent and you have oil.

CannabisExtracts,3dbzp6,Jon309,3,Wed Jul 15 02:17:57 2015 UTC,When low temp dabbing you cant expect to get it all. Sure you could torch it red hot burn your throat and get 100% of the Errl but fuck that sometime you gotta puddle a little (hopefully  not too much) but without an e-nail its hard to tell temp. The longer you do it the more you get use to it. I use the palm of my hand to feel the heat of my banger and i look to see how the Errl hits the nail if it goes away right away its too hot but it it just starts to bubble but not completely evaporate rub the glob all around the bucket then cap that fucker. When there's Errl left over next time tryn hit it a little hotter. I still puddle it sometime but its not a big deal I'd rather a nice low temp then burn my throat
CannabisExtracts,3dbzp6,The_Cavi710,2,Wed Jul 15 14:30:27 2015 UTC,"I bought a 710 whip from domeless.com.  Best decision I ever made.  Low temp works better if something is KEEPING it at that temp after you drop it on the hot nail.  If you heat your nail to 600, then drop a dab on it, it drops temp VERY fast, so the last of the puddle doesn't vape off.  With the heater continuing to heat the nail, it slowly vapes all the oil off.  I absolutely love this thing."

But it's only recently, with the legalization of weed (and subsequent commercialization of it) that attracted more people from the science fields. That's why concentrates in general have exploded and a greater demand for safe, tested products.

CannabisExtracts,3db6f1,hustl3tree5,5,Tue Jul 14 22:30:48 2015 UTC,"""Full melt"" is a term misunderstood, used, and abused. Originally the term was strictly associated with cold water hash to indicate a quality of hash, so abundant in trichome heads that it melts away entirely, leaving close to no residue, thus leading to the option of dabbing. When dabbing hash one finds all ranges of quality... Generally if you want to dab your hash you should be sourcing from hash makers who know their growers and make a product that is intended to dab. A lot of the old school sieved hash can get mistaken for dabbable IWE if one does not know any better. It the hash you've got doesn't dab and melt to your liking then I recommend balling up a bit of the hash, stick it to the side of a bowl,  heat up a quartz or glass wand and press the hot wand to the hash ball while inhaling through the mouthpiece. If you watch the hash and notice little to no 'bubbling activity' then you can determine the trichrome head count in your hash is not very high. Microscopes help too."

CannabisExtracts,3d7dp1,In_MyZone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:37:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I just put the oil in a pyrex baking thing and decarbed it then put the coconut oil in the same thing. When it's all mixed together it will be runny and not sticky at all even when cool (unless you out it in the fridge)

CannabisExtracts,3d4cqa,absoluteolly,2,Tue Jul 14 00:53:14 2015 UTC,could you potentially test your bud with a small amount in between the paper first?

Parchment paper.                   Its worth doing anywhere you need to have oil without solvents in a relatively quick manner, with very little equipment.  I wouldn't do it though if the only access you have is for really low-grade starting material."
CannabisExtracts,3d4cqa,bk2pm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"I was just curious, I use to use micro-fiber paper when the screen on a printing frame broke, figured it would work the same... i figured it would be doable if i wanted a little oil once in a blue moon since i can't buy it. I can get good quality bud so that isn't an issue, it just costs me."
CannabisExtracts,3d4cqa,absoluteolly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:09:44 2015 UTC,If you just want a little oil every once in a while this method is perfect.
CannabisExtracts,3d4cqa,bk2pm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:12:19 2015 UTC,"so whats the ideal amount of bud to use then, i imagine a gram or two, stick it between some parchment paper and stick it between a hair straightener for a minute or so?"
CannabisExtracts,3d4cqa,absoluteolly,2,Mon Jul 13 19:15:08 2015 UTC,"Its still an evolving process for everyone.                 The method I have settled on at the moment from various things I have seen is to loosely break up the bud into chunks and then compress it into a tight ball first before pressing (unless its a really dense nug to begin with).                    Then I sandwich this between some parchment and squeeze it between a hair straightener in a clamp for 6-7 seconds at X temperature (no clue what temp I am using, I am at 15/30 on my particular straightener's dial).  Before the clamp I stood on the straightener for that time with good results.                                Depending on the temp you use, depending on the qualities of the starting material, you will press for longer or shorter.  Example: I can squeeze my stardawg nugs for 7-10 seconds and it'll stay shatter.  I can squeeze my vietchem nug for the same time and it'll be sappy and hard to scrape up without an icepack.                  You need to experiment with your equipment and your weed to know the exact variables.  There are plenty of guides and videos out there now for starting reference points."

CannabisExtracts,3d6x9s,ion128,2,Wed Jul 15 01:08:10 2015 UTC,a vac isn't going to take out fats and lipids.
CannabisExtracts,3d7luc,Epiceman,3,Tue Jul 14 03:34:01 2015 UTC,"It's gonna depend on who you ask but I would generally purge for ~12 hours then flip, purge 12 more then flip again, 12 more & then test it out. I think much more than 36 hours is usually overkill."
CannabisExtracts,3d7luc,HeroboT,3,Tue Jul 14 07:16:48 2015 UTC,"depends on how much you are running. large batch runs (1/4Lb or more nugs, 1/2lb or more trim) typically come out thicker just due to yield alone and require much longer purge times because of this. This is why large format ovens are so popular in the industry for people running multiple pounds in a single run, not only because you can have more slabs but because each one can be the size of your run and still purge in a decent amount of time. Usually most commercial runs I see advertise 72-96+ hour purges, and my own product typically takes about the same as well. Every 12 hours i flip it and then put it back on my heat plate outside the oven since the oven doesn't have stone shelves, just simple wire racks. Gets all the bubbles to the top quickly so more of them pop when you pull vacuum, and your product is warm enough when it goes into the oven to stay warm again for a while from the radiant heat in the oven. Definitely helps get all the bubbles out faster as well when going the full 72-96 range has caused the strain i'm running to start clouding in the past. Just flip it when you wake up and again when you settle down for the night a few hours before bed and you're set within a few days"
CannabisExtracts,3d7luc,Faxon,2,Tue Jul 14 11:36:46 2015 UTC,What about vacuum pressure? Do yall run the pump the whole time? Or get it under vacuum and let it sit? I've heard or people doing both ways.
CannabisExtracts,3d7luc,HeroboT,2,Tue Jul 14 13:24:09 2015 UTC,"I usually run it until the muffin dies back down & pressure hits around -28 & let it sit over night, when you wake up you'll see that it probably lost (gained?) a little bit of pressure, but by then it's probably time to flip, so I'd do that & then let the pump run for another 30 minutes or so then shut it off. Unnecessary strain on your pump & power bill to just let it run imo."
CannabisExtracts,3d7luc,HeroboT,2,Tue Jul 14 14:34:04 2015 UTC,Is there some point where the pressure chamber reaches a sort of equilibrium where no more butane will be evaporated until the pump is ran again? Doesn't the butane need somewhere to escape to?
CannabisExtracts,3d7luc,HeroboT,2,Tue Jul 14 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"The way I understand it, when you're running your pump for the first 30 minutes or so that's gonna get out probably 95% of the butane, after that it's a pretty slow process. So when the muffin dies down and you shut off the pump, you basically have a vacuum inside of the chamber, and it's gonna keep pulling what little bit it can out of the oil and into the chamber, slowly raising the pressure back up. So after a while you've got a bunch of butane in your chamber, and then you turn on the pump for a minute or two to evacuate all that butane & bring it back the pressure back down.  So as long as there's some negative pressure in your chamber it should still be doing work even if the pump is off."

It is a common misconception that everything made in China is ""bad"".  You can get just as high quality Titanium products in China as in the USA at a lower cost.  All of our products are tested to be Gr2 Titanium by a USA based lab that is independently run.  It is an unfortunate fact of doing business these days that some products almost have to be imported from overseas - that however does not mean the quality is poor. Our Titanium is tested in the US.  Our silicone is platinum, medical grade and our packaging is top notch.  We offer both drop shipping and wholesale!  Please PM me!"

CannabisExtracts,3d5vc3,candycornunicorn,2,Mon Jul 13 19:37:45 2015 UTC,Can you tell me about the consistency of the liquid after 24 hours?
CannabisExtracts,3d5vc3,Sidco_cat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:52:21 2015 UTC,After the extraction (24 hours) it was the same as the petroleum ether before extraction. After the fractional distillation (roughly 24 hours) it was about the same and I got about 50mL of ether back in the collection chamber. After evaporating (24 hours) I could tell it was getting more viscous with about 30mL left to go. I then poured it onto unbleached parchment paper on a pan which was on a hot plate at 70C. Unfortunately my parchment paper wasn't secured well enough and the wind flipped it with all the liquid on it. The liquid that did evaporate in the short time it was heated left a nice golden looking sticky oil on the parchment paper but I decided not to dab it because it appeared to be sweating (when I touched it there was moisture) so I was pretty sure it needed a vacuum purge at least. I'm just wondering what steps I could have taken to make this successfully.
CannabisExtracts,3d5vc3,Intoxicus5,2,Tue Jul 14 01:01:31 2015 UTC,Petroleum ether is not exactly the best solvent for Cannabis Extractions.
CannabisExtracts,3d5vc3,Intoxicus5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"Why do you say that? Because its highly flammable? It has a low bp that ensures no loss of terpenes, non polar. My only problem was how to remove it which I suspect was just vacuum purging at 60C. Another question is if vacuum purging small amounts of organic solvents is dangerous for the vacuum pump/can cause explosion?"
CannabisExtracts,3d5vc3,Intoxicus5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:20:40 2015 UTC,Toxicity
CannabisExtracts,3d5vc3,Intoxicus5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:21:28 2015 UTC,I never really considered toxicity a negative because the goal is to remove it all and at that low of a bp I thought it wouldn't be a problem to remove it. My main question is if the rotary evaporator would have eliminated all the solvent or if I still would have needed to vacuum purge it. I've heard different things like you can't remove all of a solvent with just heat (small % is stuck for lack of a better word) and all the solvent should remove eventually if you apply heat above the bp.

CannabisExtracts,3d5vc3,Intoxicus5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:30:52 2015 UTC,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4194944/  From what I have been reading removing all the pe is difficult and the studies have shown no damage from single high dose use but some scary side effects from chronic use (250 mg/kg). I'm glad it didn't work out in the end. Butane is far safer and less time consuming.
CannabisExtracts,3d5vc3,pharmaconaut,3,Tue Jul 14 04:39:48 2015 UTC,Exactly!  Pure N-Pentane would be a could solvent to try also.  And before people flip out N-Pentane itself is fine.  Some of its isomers are not so fine.
CannabisExtracts,3d5vc3,Intoxicus5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:20:47 2015 UTC,N-pentane appears safe from a few studies I have found. Do you happen to have any knowledge of how easy it would be to purge the n-pentane? From what I've found online it will be easier than PE/hexane but there isn't much info on specifically how easy (can 99%+ be removed with heat?). I'm looking for scientifically verified and tested experience/scientific studies but no luck in my search yet.

The extract is technically solvent free at this point youre mixing solvents and terpenes up"
CannabisExtracts,3d1tmi,Stoned4days,0,Sun Jul 12 22:58:45 2015 UTC,First off they aren't good grade flavoring a or anything like that maybe do some research of terpenoids and what they are present in. People wanna cry about flavors but if they knew anything they'd know that at the temps your making that shit with it would never have flavor with out reintroducing natural terpenes. It's not e juice. Hasn't been for years. Terps are found in everything so fake food grade terps is one of the dumbest most ignorant responses I e seen about Solventless  Is water a solvent too. . . Rook
CannabisExtracts,3d1tmi,djmoans,5,Sun Jul 12 23:07:23 2015 UTC,"If you actually understood what your smoking then you would realize the concentrate that goes into the clear is what I referred to as food grade. Not the terpenes added later in the process. Those readded terps were not derived from cannabis so you end up adding random ass flavors to try and ""simulate"" a cannabis taste. Im by no means a Rook and your response proves you to be the ignorant one in this conversation."
CannabisExtracts,3d1tmi,Stoned4days,-1,Mon Jul 13 02:03:34 2015 UTC,I fucking forgot only can minus flowers and concentrates are the only things on the planet that naturally have terpenes in them. I don't give a fuck what you think you know after that statement.  But you should calm. Mr fucking your response proves you to be blah blah blah.  What you just said about terpenes is contradicting you trying to be a smart ass.  Quit while your ahead.  The only thing I find wrong with Solventless extracts is they are not 96% pure it's bullshit they advertise that shit to justify charging top dollar. But since they do start with bho and pho ratios I think that's the only reason it can retain maximum 77% that's the highest I've seen any Solventless shit like the clear and the clarity.

They completely ripped off sol with that honey comb logo and even if it is Solventless there's no way that they aren't reintroducing natural terpenes. Just because they tell you it's potent or you think you feel how potent it is there is not one lab test to prove its ""potency"" any lab you find that tests Solventless like the clear and the clarity and this stuff is shamefully blowing smoke up your asshole by telling you it's anything over 77%. It's bull it may taste good  but there has yet to be 1 company that tells the truth that it's not that potent at all. Butane as a solvent is good for extraction. Propane as a solvent is great for holding onto terps and flavs. Dry sift is the best stuff you will ever smoke. Period. Fact.

First filter smells worse than the nastiest cigarette butt you've ever smelled, and looks the part to match. Filter it till the filter stops pulling shit out, will take a few passes but you will stop pulling particles eventually and it will be much much cleaner. it gets REALLY obvious when you save up a years worth of claim and purge it all at once, there is a huge layer of black soot on the bottom of the jar. Doesn't matter if you dab the finest of fine shatters, there will always be some build up over time in this manner and is the same shit that you are scraping off your nail, just that those particles were finer and thus came out in the vapor, but your rig caught them. Even dabbing isnt 100% clean, there is still a tiny tiny amount of smoke/ash/soot released mainly toward the end of the dab, and it's more common with batches that have high lipid/wax and chlorophyll content."

CannabisExtracts,3cy4z1,michaelbrewer7,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:29:12 2015 UTC,Yea oxidation of Ti is fine as you can scrape it off and it's still safe to dab from. Seeing rust would mean you've got a nail that's not pure and THAT can be extremely dangerous for your health. if you have a nail that's rusting and your lungs arent already in extreme pain then IDK what the hell but you need to pay more attention to how your dabs taste and how harsh they are
CannabisExtracts,3cy4z1,Faxon,3,Sun Jul 12 01:07:37 2015 UTC,Did you see like a few weeks ago the guy posted his rust covered nail he had been using? Disgusting
CannabisExtracts,3cy4z1,michaelbrewer7,3,Sun Jul 12 02:07:25 2015 UTC,"that is exactly why i posted this. I remember when I first started dabbing I used a cheap china nail. it NEVER got that bad and i could feel what it was doing to my lungs every single dab, it was so bad. Once I got the money (after I realized wtf and that it was bad) I got a DualiTi that I still use to this day. Scrape it regularly and a good pure Ti nail will last you a lifetime. I bought Ti for my E-Nail even because of this. To many times I've seen peoples nice quartz bangers that they paid $40-80 for get broken somehow, and I've already broken a few glass spacers either during cleaning (my spacers have a small drop down so I claim them only semi-regularly). I don't even empty my water very often because unless i'm doing flavor profile tests, my daily driver tends to over all taste better when I let it sit for a while, because terpenes build up in the water and definitely add to the flavor on some dabs as a result. Also, keeps your water from having shit build up that's living in it because most terpenes are anti-bacterial and anti-viral in nature as well. If you don't think it's very significant, try saving the water in a glass bowl and torching it with your vector. Shit will spark off like crazy the same way under-purged wax does because terpenes are flammable too. This is also why the spark test is bullshit, since these terps wont produce popping, but they WILL burn the same way as butane."

CannabisExtracts,3cxzfy,green600,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:14:39 2015 UTC,"denatured alcohol is ethanol with a bit of acetone added to it, the acetone has a higher vapor pressure than isopropyl alcohol and so it's easier to remove than isopropyl, but either can be evaporated fairly simply.  if it sketches you out, buy a bottle of everclear it has all the improved solvent properties with none of the poison."
CannabisExtracts,3cxzfy,Lehk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:01:46 2015 UTC,"actually its not acetone thats added its methanol which is highly toxic and can cause blindness, and is a reason denatured alcohol is also called methylated spirits.

I dab off an InfiniTi nail stock nail, with the female end used as the spacer to hold the coils in place under the large dish. Works really well, would definitely recommend getting a better E-nail though if it's an option since the cost of two whips is about the same as any standard flat coil PID setup. I was just hoping 1 would be enough so i could have multiples, but live and learn. At least it works, I could not be happier ultimately with the improvement!"
CannabisExtracts,3cyio6,Faxon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:10:59 2015 UTC,What nail do you use with it? And how much does nail material effect temps? And how much temp drop do you experience? Sorry for the barrage just trying to learn!
CannabisExtracts,3cyio6,CannabisExtractsCO,2,Sun Jul 12 01:28:07 2015 UTC,Material effects temp a lot. With the ti nail that I got from GIMIDO I usually set the temp at 710 to 725 for nice low temp dabs. When I got my ceramic nail I raised it to 810-825 for the same nail temp. Also with ti my temp would drop as much as 25 degrees sometimes. With ceramic only 5 or 6 at most. Not sure about quartz unfortunately.

CannabisExtracts,3cyio6,enteater12,3,Sun Jul 12 02:11:40 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of variables involved, such as the type of concentrate, how the unit is calibrated, how tight the coil fits on your nail, what the nail I made of, how big your dabs are etc. To find out what works best for you, just play around with the temp. Start out at 700ish, if it takes too long to clear the dab, turn it up. If it vaped to fast, turn it down. You'll find your sweet spot after a day or two of use. I find myself changing the temp of my unit all the time depending on which concentrate I'm using and how brave I am with my dab sizes.   Just to put into perspective how much all these variables change everything, if I set my nail at 666 like /u/grandmafuxalot it would take like 4 tries to clear the rig. My unit is set at over 700 almost always."
CannabisExtracts,3cyio6,NLclothing,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:02:45 2015 UTC,Very informative! Thanks for the reply guy!
CannabisExtracts,3cyio6,NLclothing,2,Sun Jul 12 05:06:13 2015 UTC,I keep mine at 720 with the supplied 18mm quartz nail. Any less and it seems I'm keeping my carb cap on forever. Temp might be high but this has worked for me.
CannabisExtracts,3cyio6,NLclothing,2,Sun Jul 12 13:22:59 2015 UTC,"Man I've been running mine at 530 lately, with a cap of course. I've never felt like I've needed it above 600.. I'm using a flat coil though, and I have an input shift of about -70° (to better reflect the actual nail temperature).. So I guess I am sitting around 600."
CannabisExtracts,3cyio6,NLclothing,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:44:12 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on the input shift? What is that exactly?
CannabisExtracts,3cyio6,NLclothing,2,Sun Jul 12 15:38:39 2015 UTC,"The input shift is a correction for what the thermocouple reads in contrast to what the actual temperature on the surface of the nail is. I think most people dont bother to check the temperature of the nail and just go by whatever the controller reads.. But in reality there's a difference. So without the shift set my controller would read 600, but my IR thermometer would read 530 (for example). The input shift just corrects that difference.  Word to the wise; if you set your input shift low enough to cause the ambient temperature being read to drop below the minimum temperature for your thermocouple type, the PID controller will register it as an error."
CannabisExtracts,3cyio6,NLclothing,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:05:35 2015 UTC,Ohhhh that makes a lot of sense! Id assume that input shift varies with coil and nail type too. Are these setting relatively easy to configure?
CannabisExtracts,3cyio6,MeltinWax,2,Sun Jul 12 17:12:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, coil and nail would absolutely have an affect. The input shift is super easy to set, it just depends on your controller type. If you have an E5CC I can totally help ya out with that of ya need!"

Putting it through a coffee filter wouldn't hurt, but I'm not sure what it would accomplish either. You need to apply heat to it to boil off the ISO somehow. I wouldn't just let it evaporate.

CannabisExtracts,3cykvo,mrjderp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:55:15 2015 UTC,"I do this with my reclaim, it works great. I do advise running it through a few coffee filters to get all the particulates out, then I usually put it in Pyrex and in the oven at 250 deg. Once all of the iso had evaporated off I wait another ~30 min and take it out to freeze"

CannabisExtracts,3cykvo,mrjderp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:34:58 2015 UTC,"Throw you're mixture into the freezer for 24 hours before putting it through a coffee filter and make sure while you're filtering it you do it in the freezer, it'll be better because you'll have less contaminates in your claim, then I just let it evap off at room temp until it's got a little cloudy water left in it which I pour out then wait another 24 hours might i also suggest evaporating in a measuring cup so that when it's done you can warm It up and mix your butter/coconut oil into it for your brownies!  I jut made oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and the oatmeal did a great job at masking the reclaim flavor!  Also if you can find sunflower lecithin that will make the edibles hit you faster, you can use soy lecithin but it's basically 100% gmo I don't know if you care about that sort of thing just letting ya know! Happy cooking!"
CannabisExtracts,3cykvo,NSFWies,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"I bake it until it stops boiling, then I wait another 30 minutes before taking it out. Put it in the freezer until it's amiable but not frozen completely, then pull it and mix it into butter if you're going to bake with it. Since you're using reclaim there's no reason to freeze it beforehand."
CannabisExtracts,3cykvo,twopiffsonthehighway,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:23:35 2015 UTC,"the freezing part is called winterizing.  supposedly, plant waxes precipitate out and form solids.  then you filter at this low temp and get out useless things from your reclaim iso mix.  however, i dont see the point in doing that.  all it would do is increase potency.  i doubt it would taste like much of anything.  filtering is a fine idea though.  if i was making it into an edible, i wouldnt do the winterizing part.  not needed."
CannabisExtracts,3cykvo,highassnegro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:10:06 2015 UTC,"I always put my iso/reclaim mix through a filter, just in case anything's fallen into the rig etc.   Then I pour it onto a Pyrex dish and let it evap until it looks like there's no iso left. At this point, I'll set my hair dryer to high heat/speed and point it at the pyrex for about an hour. This heats the dish up quite a bit, and helps to remove the last bit of iso/water. Since it's reclaim, you don't have to worry about losing terps to heat.  I've never had the end product tested, but it's never tasted of iso and has no bubbles when you hold it up to a light, so I'm confident it's safe to smoke. I've been doing so for over a year with no issues"

CannabisExtracts,3cy74g,destr8y,2,Mon Jul 13 19:04:58 2015 UTC,Your lungs will regret you going cheap when picking out titanium. The site you posted is very similar to thickassglass dot com because both companies purchase china glass in bulk and sell it to you or whomever has bought from that website. I personally dont support china glass but understand that it is often way more affordable for someone just starting out. The problem I have is with people purchasing cheap nails like the ones you listed because often they are not pure gr2 titanium and will cause havoc to your lungs when repeatedly used. A quality titanium nail from an american made company will run you from forty buck and going up to a hundred dollars sometimes a little bit more.
CannabisExtracts,3cy74g,destr8y,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:50:52 2015 UTC,This is absolutely true.  Be really careful buying cheap titanium.  We sell certified GR2 Titanium nails and the cost for us to get them is about 4x what we could pay for the cheap stuff.  A good nail will cost $30 and up.

CannabisExtracts,3cvgkt,mau5trapper2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:52:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Legalising caused marijuana to be treated like alcohol even going so far as to combine cannabis control with the Liquor Control Board, so both you have to be 21+ to purchase and are taxed heavily. Medical here is, for the most part, untaxed at around $10/gram for bud and Oil heavily varies. I can get some fantastic clean oil for $25/gram at a farmers market because I know some of the vendors pretty well (I can't go to the market but they'll vend to me privately), but it isn't unheard of to pay up to $80/gram for about the same quality stuff I have access to. As well though the legalisation bill has provisions to shut down WA's MMJ program if I am not mistaken. I know we are in danger of being shut down, but the details are hazy for me right now."

CannabisExtracts,3cwiy9,WeedScientist,3,Sat Jul 11 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"Despite popular lore, VG is NOT a suitable solvent for cannabinoids. If you got your tincture tested you would find it is probably very low potency. I'd say you have a batch of bad smelling, bad tasting low quality waste.   Next time use Everclear like u/shroompickin suggests."
CannabisExtracts,3cwiy9,oldtreefarms,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"I have been looking for an ""efficiency chart"" to show the percent of extraction attainable for each method/medium. I know GA is definitely more efficient than VG, but I just want the most effective way to infuse food and candy. If I extract from 1oz of ~10%THC strain, I should net 2800mg of goodness. Unfortunately, it's not a perfect world so a chart would be a great help in calculating serving size to mg ratios."
CannabisExtracts,3cwiy9,mastererrl,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:14:23 2015 UTC,"Coconut oil.  First of all, VG is a suitable sovlent, it's a lipid. It's just not an efficient solvent, google the skunk pharm for more. I have found that cold VG extractions over long periods of time are fantastic for medical effects, probably because they remain high in cannabolic acids in comparison to decarb'd heat extractions. The former is barely intoxicating even for the new user, the later is but only mildly so and is barely perceptible to a proper ent, but the microdose is wonderful.   By the way, VG is about two thirds as sweet as sugar, and far less harmful to the body. A tablespoon of vg extraction in organic green tea is absolutely delicious.  I'm a firm believer in the power of full spread cannabinoid consumption, obviously.  Concentration prior to infusion into a consumable lipid certainly does result in a stronger product, but a that point I recommend you simply consume the concentrate, because it is easier to titrate dosages; having said this, alcohol > vg / pg spread is the way to eliquids at home, unless you want to just buy EJ Mix!  For medibles, the winner winner chicken dinner for my folks has been:  Coconut oil infusion!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Easy to make and works every time.  Simple, simple way: A cheap lil crockpot intended for salsa or nacho cheese or whatever has a low, low temp and is just the right size for a quarter. Grind the bud, decarb it in the oven on 225 for 40 minutes, drop it in there, add your coconut oil to fill 'er up and plug it in. Wait six hours. Strain. Pour into a container and refrigerate. It'll solidify. Use as a 1:1 replacement for butter. Coconut oil is shockingly good for you, it's best to use first press virgin which is ridonkulously high in lauric acid. You can use it as medicine. It just tastes nutty in your mouth, but will absorb sublingually."
CannabisExtracts,3cwiy9,umbrajoke,2,Tue Jul 14 12:42:32 2015 UTC,That's because VG isn't a solvent suitable for making tinctures. Everclear is the best option.
CannabisExtracts,3cwiy9,ShroomPickin,2,Sat Jul 11 15:49:57 2015 UTC,What if you can't get everclear?
CannabisExtracts,3cwiy9,oldtreefarms,2,Sat Jul 11 16:45:11 2015 UTC,"I have read of people doing 151 rum instead, but as I said to /u/weedscientist, each method has an efficiency rating and if by example I'm getting 500mg by washing a quarter with 180 proof, I may only get 450mg or so by washing with 151 rum. These numbers are strictly pulled out of my ass, but you get the idea."
CannabisExtracts,3cwiy9,ShroomPickin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:18:18 2015 UTC,"90%+ Isopropanol alcohol. People get all iffy about consumption, but if you assure you properly purge your product, I feel like the residuals are so minute that it becomes non-hazardous.   disclaimer  (Not a scientist, and I have never had any of my products tested, but I'm not dead.)"
CannabisExtracts,3cwiy9,oldtreefarms,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:05:23 2015 UTC,"So ISO is methanol (don't drink it) and Everclear is ethanol, which is ""drinkable"" alcohol, from the non-scientists perspective, I suppose. Not that you'd ever drink it straight, if you are sane...  Extraction of cannabis with ISO, as with butane and CO2, is fine; the methanol evaporates from the concentrate and you simply do not consume it.   Safety is a different issue. Alcohols tend to burn...or blow up."

CannabisExtracts,3ctwj8,DaBomb326,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:35:04 2015 UTC,"Any reason you are using a 1inch iron vs a 2incher?  Also, how long of a press  at 220-240? Im assuming you only press down once at a time."
CannabisExtracts,3ctwj8,DaBomb326,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:52:34 2015 UTC,Yeah no CPR on this. I start slow and press hard after. I have a 2 inch but even with the arbor there was the slightest of cracks between the iron. Can't have that. Also the lowest temp on the 2 inch is 300f or higher whereas the 1 inch iron can sit at a really low temp. Slow press to heat the nug and then power it home for the finisher. About a ten second press.
CannabisExtracts,3ctwj8,DaBomb326,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:00:38 2015 UTC,"Okay great, thanks for the insight. Do not think i would have thought about that.   So estimate it a little bit, about 4 seconds of warming it then power it for the rest orrrrr?"
CannabisExtracts,3ctwj8,joey1026,2,Fri Jul 10 23:08:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely by feel for this rather than time. Press it down and just lean your hand down on the lever. You will feel it compress. What we want to avoid here is a rupture in the paper from too much pressure too fast. Once its all the way compressed like I physically cannot compress it anymore I count to five. Probably. It really takes practice and depends on nugs, nug size, 1 inch vs 2 inch, and temperature. I will fold a chip over twice so its quartered then press one to two more times. Sometimes I'll take a thrice pressed Patty and Patty it on another Patty and press those. Shit will still juice."

CannabisExtracts,3cuccu,kentucky_shark,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:49:08 2015 UTC,Both rigs look like good starter buys but the ceramic nail your looking at won't fit on either of them both rigs have male joints and need a female nail while the ceramic nail you are looking at is male. The first rig seems to he the better option in my mind and that does come with a nail however the basic glass nails are liable to break so your idea of buying a new one is a good one. I would look for a female domeless nail and would try to look more towards quartz or titanium ceramic is hit or miss especially if you get a low quality ceramic.

CannabisExtracts,3cve0r,rastahmastah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:15:53 2015 UTC,Yeah. next time boil some water at a low temperature and put a pyrex dish (with the shatter in it) on top of the water. that way u can regulate the temperature much easier.
CannabisExtracts,3cve0r,Faxon,2,Mon Jul 13 04:25:41 2015 UTC,"I did that toward the end actually,  how long should I do it for and like at 100 degrees?"
CannabisExtracts,3cve0r,mastererrl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:46:40 2015 UTC,100 degrees is like the air lol. try 150-175. I guess the temp depends on different strains I'm not really an expert. whatever way u can think of to keep the temp regulated. I've heard of people using their electric ovens but not gas. or using thermometers in the water dish
CannabisExtracts,3cve0r,ZeektheFinch,2,Mon Jul 13 05:14:07 2015 UTC,"Electric skillet is what I'm using but 115 is like a low temp purge, slower the better I thought but idk :( i tried it at 170 and it burnt it that's why it looks like that I think."
CannabisExtracts,3cve0r,whiskeybrick,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:23:57 2015 UTC,"yeah that's one approach but it's tough to get all the butane out without heating it past 115. again that's like the summer air in california. the idea is you want the heat not to exceed the combustion temp of the thc. so theoretically, it will not burn if you stay within that temp. I would say at least 150 degrees and you would want to whip it/mix it up at that temp just to get all that butane out. do it on glass/pyrex dish instead of right on the paper."

CannabisExtracts,3cue80,awwpickles,2,Fri Jul 10 21:25:10 2015 UTC,"There are many different ways of extracting cannabinoids via solvent extraction. Limonene, alcohol, butane, propane, and co2 are the most common. That being said extractions can be done with other alcohols (isopropyl or methyl alcohol) and hydrocarbons. For wax or oil i'd use a silicone container I like the budderblocks from: http://errlybird.com/collections/budderblocks they have 2 different kinds a square block and a pad. The pad is for Shatter or pull n' snap and the blocks are for budder but can still be used for shatter too (little bit harder to work with)  If you don't have a nail you can go down to your local smoke shop and ask for a titanium nail (dont say it's for cannabis) and you'll be fine. Just make sure the nail fits on the joint that your pipe has if it's male or female 10mm 14mm 18mm"

CannabisExtracts,3cpfo9,Jacoboritt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:42:26 2015 UTC,To get the water out spread it as thin as you possibly can and your results will look much better. I find its exponentially harder to get the water/ISO out if the slab is thicker

Once the dish was a even golden color from the heat I just used it between 680-740* depending on what I was dabbing, the dish has seasoned up great so far and I didn't have one bad hit during the process."

CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,superzepto,7,Thu Jul 9 03:25:22 2015 UTC,"I've been using a QWET technique for a while now, here's a style i've found that works   break your weed up into little buds, don't use a grinder or anything just break them until you get popcorn size nugs. place the broken up weed in a container, and your alcohol (still separate, don't mix them yet) in a freezer for 6 or more hours. This helps prevent any waxes or chlorophyll contaminating the extract. after the ethanol is chilled and the bud is frozen, pour enough ethanol in to completely cover the bud, give it a quick shake & stir, then put it back in the freezer for 10 minutes strain out the liquid, and repeat step 3 two more times. You may want to keep the third pull separate, as it tends to have a bit more wax/chlorophyll in it. It's still useable, just not top quality proceed to evapourate and purge as usual"
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,techlos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:35:30 2015 UTC,Perfect answer
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,popeyesfatface,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:39:21 2015 UTC,"Except for the 10 minutes thing.  Way too long for my tastes but YMMV.  I also do not mix the first pull with anything.  The 2nd/3rd if I get that far are all mixed for edible use, with the pristine first for dabbing purposes."
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,bk2pm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:42:36 2015 UTC,"I think the time depends on your bud quality a fair bit. Where i live the weed is mostly grown outdoors, sometimes you get some quality bud but usually it's kind of average. I tried doing quicker washes, but 10 min seems to be the best balance between yield and quantity for the bud i use."
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,techlos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:48:56 2015 UTC,"I could see that.  For me, the difference between a golden extract vs an amber one is a 1min soak vs 2~3min, all frozen."
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,bk2pm,3,Thu Jul 9 16:50:47 2015 UTC,Just use everclear. Iso is not food safe
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,dabsahoy,2,Thu Jul 9 16:34:58 2015 UTC,"The water content is higher; your evaporation times will be longer as a result. I'd look into finding the highest proof grain alcohol you can get to minimize that. Ethanol produces an azeotrope at 95% ethanol by volume, which is as good as you can get without going to a chemical supply house or drying the stuff out yourself chemically. Or just wait it out, in which case the teansiest bit of heat will help after the first 24 hours, when it's safe to do so.  But more or less everything works the same :) one huge benefit of store-bought grain alcohol is that it's food safe - ethanol will not harm you if there's a teensie bit left over, and there shouldn't be any contaminants. One can't necessarily say that about ISO without doing research and ensuring a complete evaporation. Alcohol tinctures are also a good preparation that I've enjoyed quite thoroughly! I have no hands-on experience evaporating though, so I can't give you good estimates on time frames unfortunately :/"
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,whatismyotheraccount,2,Thu Jul 9 04:18:03 2015 UTC,Looks into this 100% Ethanol
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,textisaac,3,Thu Jul 9 06:49:57 2015 UTC,It's so pointless to get 100% ethanol. It will turn into 95% percent the second you open it. Might as well just order some 190 proof.
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,awhaling,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:07:24 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much the same. Only difference is you can soak ethanol a little longer than iso and it might take a bit longer to evaporate.   I would really recommend using heat to help the purging process. I've tried no heat purges with both qwet and qwiso and it never was good enough except during the summer when its 90+ degrees outside. That's because the water isn't able to get out. No harm will come, but there will still be water in your extract. Usually t just makes it less stable."
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,awhaling,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much the same, as others said, freeze your starting material (not too broken up) and solvent so they are nice and cold for extraction. Pour enough ethanol to cover bud, swirl for 10-20 seconds, strain out onto pyrex. I usually use a skillet on low and IR thermometer for purge/evaporation but either way it'll be a scrapefest after all solvent is gone. I prefer 99.99% ISO though as I feel like there's an aftertaste to the ethanol that isn't there with ISO. Happy extracting!"
CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,popeyesfatface,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:38:42 2015 UTC,I wish I could get some 99% ISO. Right now I'm playing with KleenXtracts and it's good. It's better than Everclear but still leaves behind a tiny bit of that 'sweet' taste. The only ISO I can get is 91% and compared to 96% Etoh or Kleen It leaves behind a chemy taste and definitely a lot more water moisture.

CannabisExtracts,3cmuvr,TheDoobieDoesIt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:39:11 2015 UTC,I'll add to what /u/techlos said.   Ethyl Alcohol is expensive. If you have a lot to run and are running trim I would suggest kiefing it out beforehand.   If you can make sure you can get the alcohol and bud/kif to a sub zero temperature.   I only soak (bud) for 3 minutes at -10 to -15.  Kif is simply swirled around for a minute.   You need a hotplate man. You need some heat from below to make sure you evap the alcohol. A simple griddle from Walmart on the lowest setting is usually good. (Stays around 100F). I Thin film evap with heat below and a fan on top.   There will be more water moisture in the Etoh over ISO but I found the taste of EtoH far outweighs ISO.

The tards buy local flower blast it into poop and sell it to the uneducated masses for a bit less than the guys that actually blast decent material from out of state using good tech.

CannabisExtracts,3cj1ss,SFGIANT415,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:20:14 2015 UTC,Shatter generally isnt very loud smelling. It is once heated up in your hand or pocket but when fuully stable it keeps most of those smells within the glass like surface.
CannabisExtracts,3cj1ss,Faxon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:57:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, im less freaked out haha im gonna go dab that now :)"
CannabisExtracts,3cj1ss,goalzy,2,Wed Jul 8 11:21:48 2015 UTC,"The most shattery shatter won't have as much flavor or smell, because it has less terpenes. this is also why it's so stable though, because some terpenes can cause destabilization. Personally I hate this kind of shatter though. No flavor, no smell, usually means it doesn't really get me that high at all. It's gonna be super high THC %, but pure THC isn't what I need or like lol.  With that said, with the right process and careful purging, I've found that shatter definitely can retain as many terps as something crumbly. Certain terps happen to cause some batches to wax up more than others though, which is why some of the terpiest batches end up crumbly but not others. The terpiest stuff I've ever made ended up being a shatter at just under room temp, but if you let it get up to about 75f or higher starts turning into a straight sap. Was some sour D made from larf nugs about the size of beans, got 11% yield off it (was nugs sifted from trim), tested 68% THC and 1% CBD. Sadly the lab in my area doesn't have terp testing yet though. GDP from the same grower extracted the same day tested 75% THC 2% CBD, and was still just as terpy but ended up being significantly more stable. Some of the best GDP i've ever had, and due to a mix up my buddy still has 2 grams for me up at his place when we work again lol."
CannabisExtracts,3cj1ss,goalzy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:03:28 2015 UTC,"it's not black and white like this, BUT, when it comes to clean extracts, shatter is usually limited in terps, but has great glass like consistency, or on the other end of the spectrum you have things like live resin or terpy wax or sap which give more of the full profile of the plant.  I love both, but personally if i had to pick one i'd pick my winterized shatter, for health reasons."

CannabisExtracts,3cfkwg,hustl3tree5,2,Tue Jul 7 15:05:25 2015 UTC,I would make oil with 91 or whatever rubbing alc or everclear. Prob everclear since if there's residuals there's probably less damage being done. Just a guess though :/ anyway make sure everything is cold cold cold. Was it quickly before it turns green. Then evap it and you will hopefully have not black oil. Black was soaked too long extracted too many extras. May not get 100% so u could do a second wash maybe I think I read.   But I would (if you can) maybe order it online or find a good oil connect. Decarb it and add to capsule. Can mix with canola oil too if he's having trouble eating to make it hopefully absorb better. I find it works best after a meal but that may be hard. First pass matabolisim.

First, he lives in a non-med state, so whatever he gets from another source he will just have to trust that it is ""quality medicine"", there will be no guarantee.  Second, RSO is generally a full spectrum oil, non winterized, full plant, long soak, so I wouldn't even particularly recommend using street BHO for that purpose.  I don't see why he couldn't do an ethanol extraction on a half ounce, long soak, decarb in coco oil, and make caps.

CannabisExtracts,3cc7fc,hamietao,8,Mon Jul 6 20:47:50 2015 UTC,It's not just the bud. Depending on the amount of heat or pressure used it can partially decarboxylate the THC which will cause it to be runnier and less stable.

CannabisExtracts,3cc7fc,notoriousTED,0,Tue Jul 7 16:59:14 2015 UTC,No decarbed extracts should be stable. Also through decarboxylation the extract should also be activated as well.   It should be stable or sappy more less at room temp

CannabisExtracts,3cc7fc,benthejammin,4,Tue Jul 7 17:18:43 2015 UTC,Rosin shouldn't be any darker than BHO if you're using fresh good starting material.   Here's some I've made: http://m.imgur.com/a/VJc6m  The last few pics are nice thick globs and they're definitely not dark.

CannabisExtracts,3cc7fc,benthejammin,2,Tue Jul 7 23:18:32 2015 UTC,The pic you're talking about was from some hash and it was about a gram of rosin. A half gram of flower rosin should not be darker than a full gram of hash rosin.

Also, /u/popeyesfatface's estimate of total cost is a bit low. I spent about $380 on my chamber setup getting a CPS pump for $130, a chamber for $150, and a heat source for $100. Everyone always forgets the cost of an accurate heat source, which is actually the most important part. You can get the cheapest pump that will pull to -30, and DIY the chamber so you don't have to spend a dime on anything besides the lid, but you're still gonna want to spend $100-120 on a heat pad with a temperature delta of less than 5 degrees.

CannabisExtracts,3c9rz1,6strings1voice,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:24:22 2015 UTC,Have some shots where the airflow hole is visible?
CannabisExtracts,3c9rz1,6strings1voice,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:33:12 2015 UTC,These actually don't have an air hole on them. I can make some though :)
CannabisExtracts,3c9rz1,6strings1voice,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:24:52 2015 UTC,You should.  Otherwise you might have a lot of disappointed customers on your hands.  Most vapor globes I've seen had an air intake hole.  Guess it depends on the product you're making them for though.
CannabisExtracts,3c9rz1,6strings1voice,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:33:01 2015 UTC,What ones are you referring too? All the ones I have purchased in the past (a bunch) none of them had a carb. I have seen the Tornado  I think thats the name and that was the only one.   Also the Ones I got from China or UPTech etc.. NONE of them have them.  source image   Edit: its kind of a pain in the arss to use a carb with one of these pens. You are really using it with one hand just like a eCig. They have airflow that comes through the bottom. It does get clogged up sometimes. just have to heat that sucker up for a second or so to get it loose
CannabisExtracts,3c9rz1,nakdamink,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:04:55 2015 UTC,"Its most likely Chinese.  There is some airflow through the coil, but not nearly enough, especially if it were to be clogged.  I wouldn't call it a carb either, just necessary.  Also, making them all with a small 1.5-2mm airhole will be a universal product.  Maybe I can find a picture or take one."
CannabisExtracts,3c9rz1,Faxon,2,Tue Jul 7 07:11:16 2015 UTC,Really everything you see is from China one way or another. The airflow is not really through the coil either. Let me know when you find one other than the Tornado that has a carb or airflow.   If you have used these things for any period of time you know that the oil/resin etc... has a tendency to spill/bubble out of the atomizer especially if you take a couple puffs and put it in your pocket while it's still warm.   If they had a small carb or hole even the 1.5/2mm it would get messy for sure.

That way nothing will show up on your actual credit card bill, except the purchase of the card."

CannabisExtracts,3c7fuy,FeelingCute,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"I've got an XL qcb and it took them no longer to get it to me than a regular one, I think they just put that 2 weeks wait thing to cover themselves. The only real benefit is that it's better for bigger dabs, so if you feel like you're not getting enough room in your regular QCB then maybe it's time for a switch. However, if you aren't taking monster dabs I've noticed that it actually performs worse than the regular qcb, so I'd only get it if you're taking some big boy dabs on a regular basis."
CannabisExtracts,3c7fuy,FeelingCute,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"well i mean it really varies for me, some times ill take globs and sometimes ill take regular dabs. But i am not taking lil baby dabs all the time. This will be my first QCB and im tired of seasoning quartz so i want a good one lol"
CannabisExtracts,3c7fuy,FeelingCute,2,Sun Jul 5 17:14:31 2015 UTC,"well if it's your first qcb i'd consider just getting a regular sized one, the XL is really only good if you take mega dabs all the time, the regular size one is more versatile in what it can handle. You don't really wanna take small dabs off the XL, for some reason it simply doesn't function as well. Also you don't really need to season QCBs or high quality quartz in general, dabbing off freshies is my favorite actually."

CannabisExtracts,3c7fuy,FeelingCute,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:23:22 2015 UTC,"yea man, it's a lil difficult for the first few because none of the quartz has turned opaque so it'll be hard to tell the temp, but just treat it like you normally would and you'll be fine.

It was super intense. I smoked a good 3 or 4 bowls at the concert before as well, and had a few bowls with a guy I shared my piece with. But yeah, while the gloves were neat and looked like living tie dye, I can imagine how more acid could have made that more intense. I guess when I take psychedelics I just always understand that I'm just tripping and I know that nothing is actually happening. It honestly kind of makes tripping less intense, but it keeps me from having a bad trip where I become incoherent or get lost in hallucination, auditory, visual, or mental."

I was decarbing and I put it on wrong setting it started to vape off. So I put lid on took it off and stuck it in freezer.   I wake up tomorrow with this nasty slippery oil all over the walls of the mason jar. No purging gets rid of this I ended up tossing it. It hurts so bad and leaves shit on nail.   Not saying that's what you got. But be careful of oil that's greasy like that. See the paper all nasty but your oil looks solid still. Same as mine.

CannabisExtracts,3c3v72,ozwaldcobblepot,5,Sat Jul 4 20:24:40 2015 UTC,Hash is so easy to rosin to be fair. Flowers need tons of pressure
CannabisExtracts,3c3v72,STEZN,2,Sun Jul 5 04:22:43 2015 UTC,"yes, but atm its a question of how quick can you make it.  I've seen guys using 6 ton presses, making cold pressed rosin, making sheet after sheet.  what if you could just feed the fucker until it runs out?"
CannabisExtracts,3c3v72,ozwaldcobblepot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:51:10 2015 UTC,All I'm saying is you need like 50lbs of pressure and you can make good rosin from hash. For flowers you need a ton of pressure to get yields worth the tech. Basically that a laminator is only going to work with good hash.

If it wasn't exposed to lots of air and light it should be just fine. It will have significant cannabinoid degradation but it will still get you something. If it smells like ammonia or vinegar I wouldn't want to run it.

If you care about questionable pesticides that is haha. Even if they've stopped using it entirely there are much better dispensaries available to you :p  Here was the article: http://www.westword.com/news/denver-investigated-10-pot-grows-for-use-of-banned-pesticides-holds-plants-6654706  Lots of LivWell hate in this thread too: https://www.reddit.com/r/COents/comments/3bw803/worst_dispensary_in_denver/

CannabisExtracts,3c0i0p,taacky,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:27:36 2015 UTC,My best answer it that typically live resin is used to describe a bho extraction and form does not matter . What you have I would call cold water extraction made from fresh frozen. The only reason I wouldn't call it live resin is because I believe the term originated for bho.
CannabisExtracts,3c0i0p,codytownshend,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:02:21 2015 UTC,Not really. I guess yours is more like charas. Live resin generally refers to concentrates that can be dabbed.
CannabisExtracts,3c0i0p,TheHaloDude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:01:14 2015 UTC,"From my understanding: - Live resin is BHO made from fresh frozen.  -Fresh Frozen is harvesting the buds and putting them into a deep freeze within hours - freeze is usually for about a week.   The advantages of live resin is the TASTE and FLAVOR, not necessarily potency. Terpenes  are responsible for the buds flavor, smell, and overall aroma. When bud cures, it increases in potency but loses Terpenes (Terps) due to evaporation. Therefore the longer the cure, the more terps lost.   By putting the buds into a deep freeze and then blasting the buds, you save a majority of the terps. I believe live resin tests around 6%-8% terpenes present, and normal BHO from cured bud tests around .05%- 2%  Terps."
CannabisExtracts,3c0i0p,djmoans,0,Sat Jul 4 21:40:27 2015 UTC,I've tried moxies award winning live and cured resin they both taste like nothing. Terps also have medicinal value. Just as much as the thc and cbd do.

Solventless hash is any hash made with out a solvent so Rosin or icewax is solventless. Solvent free is BHO or other solvent wax that has had all of the residual solvent pulled from it. Rosin can be Flower Rosin which is what you see commonly with pressed nugs. Or Rosin is from kief or hash where you press icewax/high grade kief in a teabag to get a really pure solventless oil. If you are willing to do the work, don't buy solventless from the store unless you think its worth its price. If its more expensive than BHO, just do the work yourself off your favorite strains."

CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,smk17,7,Fri Jul 3 05:48:18 2015 UTC,Its because propane burns hotter so it could fuck your nail if you don't know how to use it properly
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,foremanwild,2,Fri Jul 3 06:51:15 2015 UTC,"I use a propane torch as well and I love it. The huge tank seems to never run out. I've heard/read online that propane leaves a residue on the nail. I have been using propane for about 2 years and my nails look like they have the same wear and tear as a nail that is only heated with butane so I'm really not sure about the accuracy of the claims. The fact that it burns hotter shouldn't be an issue though, just heat for less time."
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,Joebuddy117,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:10:01 2015 UTC,"Well, they are both hydrocarbons, so i dont see why they would make a difference, other then in heat. Both are (i assume) burned off completely as they are expelled as a gas, so i dont think it really matters to be quite frank."
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,meow-my-nips,2,Fri Jul 3 13:23:07 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly.
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,Joebuddy117,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"It is an issue for most people, unless you use strictly Ti. Propane absolutely will crack ceramic fast, and can shock quartz. It has nothing to do with residue on a nail, it's the temp that can hurt it. It'll damage your Ti also (oxidizing at high temps) but not too much. If you have a dropdown or a piece where the nail isn'ttoo close to the glass itself, you should be fine. Don't ever go quartz or ceramic with propane tho"
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,mastererrl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:57:30 2015 UTC,"I have a quartz that has latest me at least a year and I've only ever used propane. I don't torch the shit out of it. I pay attention to what I'm doing to avoid that problem. I also don't torch my ti till its red hot either, its not necessary to do to that."
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,Joebuddy117,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:08:11 2015 UTC,"I've got a quartz going on 6 months now and I use a propane torch as well, torch the shit out of it all the time. Red hot, 7 -13 times a day, everyday."
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,HerboIogist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"Some people don't though, and if you happen to have a nail with a slight imperfection it's a lot easier to crack. 90% of people that say don't use propane at all are people who use ceramic. Also the fact that HIVE nails say ""Do not use with a propane torch"" makes people think it's a law."
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,mastererrl,2,Fri Jul 3 16:37:56 2015 UTC,"Ayyy. I'm from Iowa, went to EF, and use a bernzomatic torch as well. My group of friends used to only use butane torches in the past, but the cost of butane was starting to get ridiculous so we switched to propane. I don't notice a difference expect the nail getting oxidized a little faster."
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,shawnyybee,4,Wed Jul 8 20:18:38 2015 UTC,People get paranoid because they think that Propane burns way hotter than Butane and that can damage your nail. This is mostly a myth. Propane by itself like in your Bernzomatic will burn only about 10 or 20 degrees hotter than butane. Propane with an oxygen supply with burn way hotter than butane and a lot of people see that number and get paranoid. My roommates butane torch actually has a bigger flame than my Bernomatic and will heat my nail faster than my propane so I have to be more careful with that torch.  I think the biggest thing is finding something with the right sized flame for your nail. If you have a glass nail you want a flame that you can adjust small so you don't crack it. If you have a quarts nail you can probably go a lil bigger. Ceramic and titanium nails and domeless nails you can go with a pretty big flame as long as you are careful not to overheat your nail.  Some people also bring up that butane burns cleaner than propane but you aren't inhaling the fumes through the piece as you are heating the nail so that doesn't matter as much in my opinion.
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,ImaginarySpider,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:29:06 2015 UTC,"If you have a glass nail, get another nail. I don't even know any non-china shops that sell glass nails anymore"
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,mastererrl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:58:38 2015 UTC,The first rig I bought was a crack pipe looking piece of shit lol.  Standard spoon like pipe but with a glass nail at the top.  After dabbing for a few weeks the nail eventually cracked in half randomly after heating it up with my bernzomatic (which I still used for a few more weeks haha).  Definitely not going back to a glass nail.
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,Munchsicles,0,Sun Jul 5 17:25:29 2015 UTC,Actually it is factual with i have a temp gun it takes almost half as much more time with butane but i can't use a propane on my hive ceramic because it heats up too fast
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,ImaginarySpider,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:17:19 2015 UTC,It depends on the torch and the size of the flame. If you are at a higher temp but a smaller flame it will take longer because you are putting heat energy into the system at a slower rate. It is physics. My propane torch I can turn it up to a pretty big flame or turn it down lower and make it smaller than most of my friends butane torches can get. My roommates butane torch has a huge flame that doesn't get very small and it will easily heat my titanium nail twice as fast as my propane torch on high.
CannabisExtracts,3bymp6,ppface12,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:28:02 2015 UTC,"bernzomatic guy here too. i have a domeless titanium nail and it works just fine with it.  my buddies have domeless quartz nails and use propane and so far so good, they haven't had any problems yet."

CannabisExtracts,3by25d,grumpysquare,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:10:38 2015 UTC,So if I were to make tincture with an ounce of product I'd need a pint of alcohol?
CannabisExtracts,3by25d,weedsmokingboobies,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:04:28 2015 UTC,I use 750 ml per ounce. Grind. Decarb. Soak for as long as you're willing to wait. Put everything in a glass inside of a pot of boiling water and stir for 10 minutes or so making sure the alcohol doesn't start boiling. Strain (cheese cloth). Enjoy.
CannabisExtracts,3by25d,qwopwaffle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:46:31 2015 UTC,If I'm using ABV do you think it'd be ok to use 10%-15% less alcohol since the bud is much less potent?
CannabisExtracts,3by25d,weedsmokingboobies,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:48:32 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Depending on how potent you want your tincture you could go even less than that. I wouldn't use less than 375 ml to an ounce of abv though.
