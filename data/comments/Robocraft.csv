Robocraft,3e3xf8,G_glop,8,Tue Jul 21 19:38:18 2015 UTC,"IMO, this type of user reaction/revolt was inevitable due to the primary focus of the game changing, as I've seen it with many other games available before pre-release.  I don't know that many people joined this game pre-meta thinking ""I hope this will become MOBA-esque"" or ""its cool if it becomes MOBA-like"" - I know I didn't.  Even if FJ had and shared that vision/idea previously with players, not everyone follows the devs to set their expectations for what the game will become.  So ultimately that leaves us with a number of players or leavers (I'm not speculating how many) who don't play MOBAs or don't like MOBA-type gameplay that feel surprised and/or disappointed in what the game's focus has become, and FJ doing a balancing act of appealing to new players that like MOBA stylings while doing things to retain existing players."
Robocraft,3e3xf8,Renegade_Meister,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:58 2015 UTC,I gave it a good steam review..so I guess it's not in the top 100.  Not sure how reviews are rated.
Robocraft,3e3xf8,DumberMonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"The default list of reviews shown on a game's store page in Steam is sorted by ""most helpful"" which is the % of people who rated the review as helpful."

It was fast paced and brutal. Build a robot and fight to the death! The new meta is so much less interesting. You're no longer fighting a horde of enemy robots, you're fighting 4-7 others over and over for half an hour and trying to shoot crystals. It's a slog fest. The game isn't as enjoyable as what is was.  It's really a shame! I love what they've done with building robots, but the new meta just ruins it."

Robocraft,3e2uai,TheSploot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:20:58 2015 UTC,couldn't more agree to this idea like missile lock-on crosshairs at every jet or mecha games
Robocraft,3e2uai,Clarzk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"This is the best solution I think, though I'd rather gun targetting points just be averaged into a second moving crosshair (like if your guns are pointed behind you it'd be at the edge of the screen and it'd move towards the center as your guns adjust).  Giving every active gun an indicator is visually noisy and the ability to try to use them to place individual plasma projectiles sounds way too finicky to be enjoyable."
Robocraft,3e2uai,og17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:49 2015 UTC,I had the same thought today when reading the thread about rotation speed and I absolutely support this idea.

On SMG and rails right now the crosshair is ""expanded"" to show innacuracy (including from rotating guns) already. I'd like a very subtle effect added to the plasmas for this too, like all of the little horizontal lines being slightly rotated when innacurate."
Robocraft,3e2hys,AwesomeArab,2,Tue Jul 21 13:27:37 2015 UTC,"Plasma/rail tracking speed is a significant and intentional balancing mechanic, not being able to twist around while having stationary weapons is half the point.  No kidding they'd be easier to use after such a big buff.  There's been requests for a hud indicator of where your guns are currently pointing at, I'd be all for that."
Robocraft,3e2hys,og17,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:25 2015 UTC,Sounds good but I would like to have this key also on nanos and smgs :) scouting around without loosing your actual target would be fine.

Robocraft,3e2hys,IAMA_Printer_AMA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:10:07 2015 UTC,"This would technically work on all weapons but wouldn't be useful on SMGs and Nanos because of their rapid turn speeds, you could still do it. As printer said, this function is near enough redundant on nanos due to auto heal. As for SMGs I feel like blind fire shouldn't really be a thing. I find there needs to be a distinction between the people focused on keeping the enemy at bay, and the people monitoring the area around them."
Robocraft,3e2hys,azrael3000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:30 2015 UTC,This would be very useful for SMGs. Best example being mega in classic mode where you fire full blast on the enemy mega and you wanna check whether a tesla is sneaking up your ass or a plasma is dropping his crap on you from above.

Robocraft,3e0u57,Stigawub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:01 2015 UTC,"Venus... is the most insular of the rocky planets, with a hyper dense atmosphere allowing very little penetration for solar radiation (or any radiation for that matter, that's why we have a very difficult time observing the planet). The reason why it's so hot is because a runaway greenhouse effect trapping whatever radiation got through in the form of heat. It's like the last place you would expect a solar flare to be significant.  (as if rain of molten iron and corrosive atmosphere is not enough) Mars on the other hand have a  thin atmosphere and nearly non-existent magnetic field, hence the surface is constantly bombarded by radiation. If we want anywhere where a solar flare would devastate the surface, Mars would be it. But the idea for a periodical storm damaging robots and requiring shelter sounds awesome."

Use Curse/TS3/Steam for voice chat, it's easier to coordinate and more fun than typing  _5) try to copy any designs you think look like fun to play -you'll learn how to build your own bots better too  _6) press F12 to take screenshots (in steam). Use the screenshots to help you understand how bots are built.  Have fun!"
Robocraft,3e40gb,gairlok,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"+1 for extra garages. I love having all kinds of different bots, with different combos of weapons and movement, and different styles of building. I definitely try and copy what I see, or make my own versions of things. Most of my IRL friends stopped playing months ago, and I have a ton of people on my friends that I maybe see once or twice in a month. I'm always down to play with new people, as long as they aren't assholes."
Robocraft,3e40gb,Blood_Lad,2,Tue Jul 21 21:25:27 2015 UTC,Pictures of your bot would be very helpful.

That bot has since been modified with all EP upgraded to t10, and a few more added, as well as adjustments in helium placement and strength. I need to go through and do some triforcing, but it has been difficult with it's compact size. Basically every block there is for counterweight or has things attached to almost, if not all sides.

I'm worried about making it too much lighter, as it's currently in around about the spot I wanted it to be. It hovers where I leave, only slightly rising while doing so, and can be maneuvered with it's thrusters faster and more reliably than hovers (at least, the current version of them). I'll definitely give it a go and see how it does though."
Robocraft,3e40gb,22GoixYT,2,Tue Jul 21 20:25:18 2015 UTC,The speed is great with tx1's. You have enough cpu to make your bot a little bigger and stronger.

Robocraft,3e00b5,Tezorian,6,Mon Jul 20 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"are you surprised? SMG is the easiest to use, you just look at something, and hold left mouse button. But then the question is: If anyone can use it, then how are you better? Honestly after using all weapons, I will say that SMG is the hardest to master.  Becoming good at rail or plasma just take practice, but to truly be good at using SMG require building skill to optimize DPS and fast decision making. ""Do I aim for the guns? do I aim for the seat? Do I dive or do I hide? Do I have enough guns left? What will I do in the 2.5 seconds span before the enemy strip me of all of my guns? Can I disable them fast enough? Do I need to go closer? Can I kill him before his friends notice?"" SMG is pretty hard. But MSMG? You look at something at they explode regardless of scenario, oh well."
Robocraft,3e00b5,radyjko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"I really like how you said this and i do agree with most of it. SMG is indeed easiest to use, but to be really good with it, you do need to be a fast thinker. However, rail requires a different approach to be effective and that is to quickly notice what spot would be best to shoot at. Can i quickly take it out or would it be better to aim for the movement or weapon parts? As far plasma goes... can't really say, because i really suck at it, but from what i've seen, that also works better if you aim for the right spot. Sometimes hitting next to a target is better than hitting the target."

Just look at some of the maps in cs, a lot of them started life as community made things, eventually they got good enough/popular enough that valve put them in the base game.    it would also be a good way to quickly ascertain whats good and whats not, the popular mods thrive and the bad ideas are ignored. if a game mode get born that's all that and a bag of chips freejam can just incorporate and refine, with most of the leg work having been done.  Look at cities skylines, or kerbal, a thriving modding community has helped them focus their energy's into the core game, while the really good mods have been incorporated into the games, hell squad has even hired some of the modders because their stuff was so well done.  I think if you look at some of the most successful games of resent time, the ones that are doing well have a strong modding community, and it shouldn't be something to be feared the mods can be kept separate, public servers with funny little game modes and a different robocraft experience, but if you want to throw down in a ranked battle and get the proper robocraft meat and two veg epicness then just hop on over to a freejam server."

Also consider upgrading EPs to the T10 versions, undertiered EP's are useless, gun mounts are exposed and not reinforced (at least 1 TX-1 block where the gun is mounted). Multiple thrusters connected to one block is prone to being one shoted, don't see a radar (they are really useful for a medic). Get rid of radar receiver in favor of a radar jammer. Not sure how many hover blades you have, the more the better. Consider having more than just 6 guns in total, since they will get blown off the way you have them set up. The two side mounted guns may not be able to hit the frontal arc effectively.  Also 253 cubes in total seems like a small amount, try bulking up more. Good luck!!"

I would say lose a pair of T6 shields and the T8 shields to make it shorter, lose most of the thrusters, make sure you don't have 2 functional items connected to any of the chassis cubes, then bulk it up a lot.

So to compare the two builds in separate battles and asking which one is better, really comes down to personal preference not the effectiveness of the build.

Robocraft,3dxypw,ik1ne,6,Mon Jul 20 13:23:46 2015 UTC,"Quoting from a forum thread:  Further, people mention the ejector seat, it is only possible because damage deadends in the pilot seat which is another bug.  Right now there are two rules, 1 Damage transfered into the pilot seat does not jump anywhere if there is damage left but no blocks on the “side” of the seat, therefor the little t2 thruster is guaranteed to survive. 2 When the pilot seat itself takes damage (shots do NOT pass through) the damage is transfered to a random block that is not connected to the pilot seat, meaning an ejector seat (seat plus thruster) only takes damage when you hit the thruster, the seat itself will absorb any amount of damage, the seat could lie on the ground without moving and you hit it with plasma, nothing happens.  Of course the ejector seats are very happy about the inertia tensor bug as well."
Robocraft,3dxypw,Flubbel,2,Mon Jul 20 14:28:42 2015 UTC,What is the inertia tensor bug?
Robocraft,3dxypw,Seboy666,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:56 2015 UTC,"SKIP THIS UNLESS YOU WANT MORE DETAIL  Any rotation of an object is around an axis, so if you for example hold down A in midflight as a bomber, you rotate around your longitudinal axis. Lets assume the number and position of your wings is fixed.  When your craft is heavier it will need longer to rotate, but not only the weight is important but also how far away that weight is from the axis in question. So it is not just a question of kg but also about how it is distributed. Just like the property which determines how fast you accelerate is called mass and measured in kg, the property which determines how fast you can rotate is called inertia tensor and is measured in kg * m. (guys, leave the matrix out of this for now, okay?). So the heavier (kg) and the further away (m) the mass is, the harder to rotate.  In RC every cube has a mass, luckily the mass is only in one point, so whenever an object has to rotate what the game has to do is the following: Determine which axis it rotates around, determine m*kg for every single cube, add them. However as the axis is shifting constantly while forces are applied this is quite the computation and because of this (and here my knowledge goes over into speculation) a simplified formula is used. However it is bugged and does not work correctly. This leads to the inertia tensor bug.  You can stop skipping now.  The inertia tensor bug: When you lose a shitton of cubes and are reduced to some little thing your inertia tensor is fucked up, to test this, have a tank with an ejector seat, see how ejector seat behaves. Build JUST the ejector seat and go into practice, see how it behaves (much less stable, impossible to get anywhere).  Check the video, right after I one hit Herbcannon on his TS I move back to base, the large German flag below the bomber is about 70% of the total weight and likely 90% of the inertia tensor, without it I can barely steer, check my rotation speed. In the shield I get healed up and can now move better the heavier I get.   Faster rotation when being heavier (at same wing and thruster count) is a bug, different behaviour of thruster seat depending on how heavy you were before is a bug, they are likely the same bug.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgmMruFGa68  Sorry for grammar, it is late and I am not a native speaker."

Robocraft,3dxypw,NotHomo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry.  What happens when a single plasma projectile hits a block is just damage to that block. Just like SMG or Rail damage, the one block that gets hit takes the whole damage.  When it hits the ground close to you, the game calculates which of your blocks is closest to the impact and  how far away it is. Depending on the distance you get somewhere between 100 and 20% of the damage shown on the tooltip (likely linear). The damage will only hit that one cube (or part) which is closest, nothing else, so it is again a single target damage and spreads just like rail damage.  The visual blast is purely visual and shows (not even exactly) how big the radius is in which you get damaged. It is however not aoe.  Plasma (unless there is a bug I dont know about) does not bypass EP, either it hits somewhere else then you thought it did, the damage spreads and your mounting block is killed, or the first projectile kills the EP, the second kills stuff behind it.  If you take damage behind an EP and the EP is still intact, please try to make a video of it happening and post in the support forum.  Source: http://robocraftgame.com/forums/topic/plasma-damage-how-it-works/#post-785527  please note that anti gunbrella radiation has been replaced with barrier protection, so the % bleed through (stated to be 70%) is not a property of plasma anymore but a property of the block hit, it can be found in the tooltip of every item. Further note that an EP does not pass on any damage as long as it has shield left."

Robocraft,3dxypw,Broski281,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"Another fact or rumor that I managed to recall - a damage dealt to pilot seat is transfered to random part.  So if you're at 100% health, it's unlikely to be one-shot killed by getting hit at pilot seat.  However, if you're at ejector seat status, if you get a hit at pilot seat then you're dead since the T2 thruster is only part you have.  Is this true, or used to be true, or false?"
Robocraft,3dxypw,Flubbel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:34:12 2015 UTC,"The Pilot seat is a ghost cube. Projectiles go thru the seat and hit the block underneath, or that's what I understand. so thats why so many people cover up the seat if they can. Its now more easier with the aerorod trick.

Usually the flying guys land next to me to blast me. Some can find the right angle to shoot through the hole..but mostly it works and we get the tower and then its the red's problem.  For a hover I just hover at maximum height and it usually gets me inside the dome..and protected from flying guys..and ground guys far away..(like snipers)  It works so well I use my SMG hover that way to capture towers. They can only get me up close and personal..as the shield of the tower protects me.

It feels to me, like most good players are playing a lot less or not at all at the moment, just like me. There's just not enough fun playing at the moment.   As for the scoreboards, i've had a few games that were close to being 4vs4 and it was fun, despite both teams having 8 players. Top 8 had a score of 80k+ ... the ones below had 20k and less.

We would platoon religiously together, sometimes with another person or 2, but would would not play robocraft solo without platooning, most of the time with each other. we both have over 1500 hours of play so we know each other's play style really well and we're both very experienced players.   It got to the point where the rest of our team was sometimes so bad that we could not carry them. Over time we both stopped playing because one or both of us would get so pissed off that we didn't want to play another game. I believe that this comes with the new meta and the emphasis on having good individual players. Classic matches are so short and fast paced that a good platoon and mega can carry the rest of the team.   Well anyways, we don't play robocraft anymore. He's moved on to Archeage and I've moved on to CSGO (I'm Gold Nova 3 I'f you or anyone reading this is looking for someone to lobby with) and we still keep in contact and have agreed to try robocraft again when something major changes.

Robocraft,3dv1lk,NotHomo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:38:32 2015 UTC,less air-brake   why does it air brake AT ALL?
Robocraft,3dv1lk,Threedawg,2,Sun Jul 19 21:05:41 2015 UTC,So you can stop?
Robocraft,3dv1lk,NotHomo,3,Sun Jul 19 21:06:50 2015 UTC,that's what hitting reverse is for.  or if you want just coast until it stops naturally from air resistance  i see no reason to code something so it's CONSTANTLY braking against your forward thrust.  that's just silly.  it doesn't work like that in real life so why would you make it like that in game?
Robocraft,3dv1lk,Threedawg,4,Sun Jul 19 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"Well, it doesnt exist in real life so there is that..  But if there was no air braking it would have infinite acceleration and no top speed. It would break the game."
Robocraft,3dv1lk,NotHomo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:36:49 2015 UTC,nah hovers exist in real life.  you should see some of the crazy stuff those quadcopters can do  https://youtu.be/VxOdXYCRAds  on a robocraft scale that thing would be doing 600-700 mph :D
Robocraft,3dv1lk,Jo3M3tal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"That thing flys, it doesn't hover. Robocraft hovers only work at a certain distance to the ground, quadcopters have minimal ground effects"
Robocraft,3dv1lk,NotHomo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:13:29 2015 UTC,well if you want to get technical i can point you at the maglev train that does 374 mph...
Robocraft,3dv1lk,Jo3M3tal,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:37 2015 UTC,A maglev train is a much better comparison. Comparing hovers to a type of helicopter that has been around for more than 100 years and behaves completely differently seems odd
Robocraft,3dv1lk,Renegade_Meister,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:44:53 2015 UTC,"IIRC FJ designed movement blocks such that hovers+thrusters should not go as fast as having only thrusters.  This is accomplished by having hovers work in the opposite direction of thrusters if the bot speed exceeds the hovers' max speed - aka airbrake.  The problem/bug was that the hovers airbraked at speeds lower than hover speeds, and that hovers never reach their max speed even when they're not overloaded with weight."
Robocraft,3dv1lk,NotHomo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:47:58 2015 UTC,such that hovers+thrusters should not go as fast as having only thrusters   but that would have been an EASY fix.  to simply activate the braking ONLY when a certain speed was reached instead of having it on ALL THE TIME :P
Robocraft,3dv1lk,Renegade_Meister,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"You're right, that would have been, but that evidently wasn't the only problem - Hence Mark's hover blade rebuild"

Robocraft,3dv1lk,DumberMonkey,2,Mon Jul 20 13:35:38 2015 UTC,"turns out that is a design flaw on your end (sorry). Hell not only have I fixed that on mine designs, I have one that self rights when its flipped.  It's just a matter of where the hovers are and how far above the center of gravity they are. Everyone wants to put the hovers on the bottom..but that is wrong.  While one can cover them with blocks..they need to be as far up as possible (and usually spread out)  It took me many hovers and a few months to get them right. Now I love hovers and can't wait for the fixes."

Robocraft,3dvxvv,TheF0CTOR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:05:36 2015 UTC,I got in an argument with him in chat
Robocraft,3dvzxk,TheSploot,12,Mon Jul 20 00:12:01 2015 UTC,"In Planetside2, area capture is the norm. The risk/reward is determined by how hard it is to stay in that location while capping it:  __1) they may have cover, but that cover can be flanked easily  __2) they are stuck defending that area until they secure the capture  __3) they may have more than one ally in the capture zone, but that doesn't affect the capture time too much  __4) shooting the avatars in the zone doesn't contest the capture, it just hurts them  __5) just move one enemy into the zone to contest the capture, that enemy must be driven out or destroyed to continue the capture  This results in active battles between the two teams, because the team that owns the ""waypoint/flag"" must return to drive off even a single attacker, but the team that wants to capture the ""waypoint/flag"" can easily set up an ambush, just by using cover.  Compared to Robocraft, the mechanics yield almost identical game play, except that with the protonium, there is a measuable sense of progress and visual effects for capturing a tower (the crystals pop). But the attackers HAVE to stay focused on blowing up the crystals, so THEY get ambushed, not the defenders.  I like the current method better, because of the advantage to the defender, and the visual effects of the crystals popping from my guns."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,gairlok,4,Mon Jul 20 04:30:59 2015 UTC,"I agree that the current mechanics is fine.  With the exception that I would change 2 things:  1.) Get rid of the connectors. Even people at t10 don't know how to efficiently clear a tower, this is both sad and angering your team. It's not a skill, just knowledge, so there's no real purpose to it. (Edit: this would probably require that towers have fewer crystals on them)  2.) Let towers heal, because at the moment successfully defending a tower, only slightly pushes out the capturing."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,azrael3000,2,Mon Jul 20 11:29:02 2015 UTC,The counter argument to healing towers is that all it does is prolong the game.
Robocraft,3dvzxk,JViz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:44 2015 UTC,not sure this is necessarily true. If you make towers easier to cap (less crystals) and have heal at the same time this will probably even the time and make the game more exciting
Robocraft,3dvzxk,azrael3000,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:54 2015 UTC,"For the losing side, it will be more demoralizing."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,JViz,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:08:07 2015 UTC,I like the healing idea.   I feel that both ideas could come together
Robocraft,3dvzxk,VonGod,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:50:30 2015 UTC,This is a very interesting perspective. i think your thoughts pretty much sum up mine. +1
Robocraft,3dvzxk,JViz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:33:35 2015 UTC,"I like the Planetside 2 mechanics because the advantage goes to the early aggressor. It gives some advantage to faster bots, whereas right now faster bots are just slightly harder to hit."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Khoakuma,8,Mon Jul 20 16:32:58 2015 UTC,"I personally think that this may create some balance issues. How will it work for flyers?  Currently fliers can still contribute to taking towers down without landing... But will this be the case for area based capture?  If it extends into the air, will this make thruster sticks OP since they would be able to easily capture points now too?  Will plasma become OP if there is no more umbrella? Will there be an umbrella?  Will capping points speed up towards late game?  Definitely lots of questions and careful thought needed."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,gairlok,3,Mon Jul 20 00:22:07 2015 UTC,"same case with classic capture i guess. the height probably will extends upward, but not unlimited (obviously the range is going to be a bit higher than classic range). flyer would have to come down for it, but they don't have to land on it. This is nice actually, gives flyer not complete dominance over the map, and thrustersticks would get the shorter end of the stick since they have a very hard time staying still."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Khoakuma,2,Mon Jul 20 01:37:09 2015 UTC,"Oh no, have to disagree with you there: all they have to do is stop moving to get the points. Yes, just park that little thing right in the middle of that clearly marked bull's eye."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Aethylred,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:59:12 2015 UTC,"i know, but that would require them to park. now they can keep flying around doing what thrustersticks does and take down towers."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,karbengo,4,Mon Jul 20 04:12:18 2015 UTC,"Aw, no more tower ninjas.  ...on the other hand, rolling your broken crippled robot into a capture zone will be the new 'problem'."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Tetrajak,6,Mon Jul 20 04:34:26 2015 UTC,My reaction: It's about time!  Maybe I will be more interested in playing battle mode when every bot has the same level of influence when capping tower rather than based on armament.
Robocraft,3dvzxk,InfiniteSynapse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:51:41 2015 UTC,Scouts would become less useless with this method of capture too.
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Psatch,3,Mon Jul 20 22:00:54 2015 UTC,Actually thought about area-based captures too. Will balance open maps by forcing rail heavy teams to move out for tower captures. Contesting is more dynamic too since players can defend while capturing instead of focusing at shooting crystals or players at a time.
Robocraft,3dvzxk,VonGod,8,Mon Jul 20 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"I like how you have to shoot the towers to capture them because it makes the game a lot more dynamic. Do you shoot the tower, or attack the enemy? Not only that, but there's also a skill in taking towers quickly through knowing where to hit and positioning oneself properly to take towers faster. I think changing tower capture to a classic mode-like base capture would dumb down battle mode just a little. Sure, you don't have to be THAT smart to shoot crystals off of towers, but you at least have to put in a little more thought/effort in the current state of the game than you would if FJ changes it to proximity-based capture.  The current tower capture method also kinda fits in with the theme of building robots in Robocraft. Just like how players die if their seat gets severed from their robot, the towers die if their crystals get severed from their trunks. Aim for the connection points for quicker destruction! The current tower capture method just seems to suit battle mode in my opinion."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,DeepMidWicket,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:40:25 2015 UTC,They were talking about how you would still need to shoot something in order to start capping the area. I think this is a good compromise.
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Curiosity87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:48:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do like the towers, but if fj aren't going to put in a tutorial, than they need to make the tower design without connection points, it's getting really old being the only one on a team that knows about them, it's not a rare thing either, literally 90% of the player base is playing the game wrong, and it's not skill based it's knowledge based, and if your not a hard core robocrafter than its an easy thing to miss."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,PM_QUIL0N_SPAM,5,Mon Jul 20 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"Man I really would love this change, for me shooting those thingies still feeals like an annoying work that just have to be done. Also I trust them to think it through or at least change it till it works^"
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Tussca,4,Mon Jul 20 00:47:21 2015 UTC,I agree. Shooting the towers is boring and I would rather have to capture a point.
Robocraft,3dvzxk,PM_QUIL0N_SPAM,2,Mon Jul 20 01:21:53 2015 UTC,But how is sitting not doing anything more interesting?
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Tussca,2,Mon Jul 20 02:05:29 2015 UTC,"It isn't a whole lot more interesting, but sitting and looking at crystals is more boring than sitting and NOT looking at crystals."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,DeepMidWicket,4,Mon Jul 20 02:08:17 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I prefer having something to do but i accept that is a matter of opinion."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Tetrajak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:15:42 2015 UTC,"If there was a point instead of a tower, your time would be spent shooting other bots to secure the capture."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Fish-Dead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:34 2015 UTC,I'm with you there; it's a lot easier to defend your capture attempt while not looking at the crystals.
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Blue_Crusader,2,Mon Jul 20 22:02:50 2015 UTC,"So, assuming we'd have the same 'get hit and the clock resets' capping system, we're going from snipers can only effectively defend a tower to snipers can dominate tower defense with unquestionable authority.  If that's a possibility, then NO, absolutely not. Base/bubble camping snipers and copter snipers could, from their base vantage point, easily cover multiple tower locations, all the while being virtually indestructible thanks to the base shield. If above the shield, they simply need to fall back into the bubble to become completely healed."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,drury,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:51:12 2015 UTC,If that means more active combat thats better because nothing is more boring than just shooting crystals.
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Tussca,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:37:09 2015 UTC,One of the better decisions made on this game. Honestly the first time I played protonium I couldn't help from asking myself why they went for block destruction in the first place. Control points do the same thing but you can actually play the game while capping them and you don't need to be an SMG tank to be efficient at capping them.
Robocraft,3dvzxk,BukkitBoss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"Terrible idea unless it's going to be different from how TDM base capture works.  Reason it's a bad idea if it's the same is how much stratagy they add. Do you cap the tower or fight off the enemy coming to stop you? You probably want to cap the tower if your whole team needs to rez.   If it's like the TDM base cap then games will be a lot less close due to you need one smg sniper to cover each tower (certain  maps make it so multiple / all towers could be covered by one smg) what I mean is that, someone is trying to cap a tower? Hit them once in the time period and it resets like TDM.  If your team doesn't need a rez then you probably should fight the enemy off before capping g the tower so they can't just cap it right back. With an area capture there is no stratagy or thinking, especially if it's like TDM. You have to fight the enemy off before you can cap the tower (which will likely leave enough time for more to come). If it's not like TDM and you cap it regardless of being shot then there's still no thinking involved because you can cap and fight.  They also add a piece of randomness in that does everyone know about shooting the brackets? If the last person standing on a team doesn't then that can very easily be the deciding factor in a match, while it can be very frustrating on your team it keeps things interesting. Much like everyone whining about there being no creativity any more because of CPU limits and armor minimums changing this will make the game simple and boring unless it's not the same as the TDM base cap.  I will acknowledge that everything all at once is a lot to take in for a new payer and I made a forum thread about reverting back to slowly introducing the game play features as you go up in tiers. As such if they're only changing it to a sit here and wait for lower tiers then that makes a lot more sense."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,Tussca,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:46 2015 UTC,"Even if the point capture mechanic was unchanged (i.e. Damage resets capture, and no ""blocking the plate"") I feel that it would speed up the game dramatically and add more interest. You can be on active alert while capturing a base, as opposed to looking up under the umbrella and shooting the dangling raspberries. You can also defend a capture pad so long as you're damaging an enemy, unlike the current mode.  As it stands, capturing the towers is more or less a no-brainer. You always want to capture a tower, and almost always want to disturb enemy players capturing your towers. This won't change if the proposed idea was implemented.   [...] games will be a lot less close due to you need one smg sniper to cover each tower    You wouldn't need to cover the towers any more than you do in the current mode. If left unchecked a player can already capture a tower in 5-10 seconds. Even with that in mind you rarely see people on defense.   Hit them once in the time period and it resets like TDM.   Which is not necessarily a bad thing. If the capture times scale with OC level or game progression you should be able to capture a point before a nearby enemy even spots you. I'd say it lends interest based on the that you CAN defend a point while waiting for backup, unlike the current mode.   Reason it's a bad idea if it's the same is how much stratagy they add. Do you cap the tower or fight off the enemy coming to stop you? You probably want to cap the tower if your whole team needs to rez.   If a design leaves room for players to become better without adding needless complexity, it's a good thing. Comparing the control point to the current fusion tower idea, the control point is no more mechanically or strategically complex.  Besides,  You probably want to cap the tower. is true either way you look at it.   I will acknowledge that everything all at once is a lot to take in for a new payer [...]   It's worth noting that in the original release of the new game mode the complexity scaled with each tier. This was ultimately removed as without objectives the game becomes a base rush. This game isn't hugely complex (gameplay-wise) compared to other mobas (which seems to be what it is trending towards), and they're working on the tutorials. Hopefully once released any difficulty with game objectives will be a thing of the past."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,BukkitBoss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:49:10 2015 UTC,"I dunno what games you play but in about half the matches I'm in people defend towers and if you can sit on a mountain with an smg to snipe to stop a tower cap indeffenetly then you don't need to have more than one or two people on defense.  You can defend in the current mode, you just cant heal the tower in the current mode.  I often leave towers uncapped making an easy cap that will rez my team and the enemy can't stop via defense.   The problem with making tutorials now is that while it's in alpha they will have to keep redoing thrm. For example if they'd already done tutorials they'd have to redo any referencing the tech tree (which is sort of going away) the armor system, the tier system. Even with the last update that changed cpu and armor minimums they'd have had to change a coupletter of tutorials. So to not waste time and money i understand not having tutorials yet."
Robocraft,3dvzxk,NotHomo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:28:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's about perspective, but I almost never get shot at while taking towers. The exception being if its a tower in view of the enemy protonium reactor, where there's usually someone marching about with rails. If I run across an enemy while in transit to a tower, they open fire of course. (I suppose I should add that I've only played a minimal amount of the three tower game mode compared to the old 4 tower one. There seems to definitely be more skirmishing at mid now... but it's not really centralized on the tower.)  Defending in the current mode is really just dependant on killing the other guy(s) first. If you can accomplish that you managed to temporarily prevent the capture. Unless you were defending at a critical time (i.e. whole other team dead, long respawn timers) chances are your defense didn't really do much - especially if you die in the process. That to me is a little bit of a bummer, as all you did was delay the inevitable by a few seconds.  With a control point you have the chance to actually prevent the capture entirely. If you kill your opponent you've done something worthwhile as the capture bar rolls back when they're not present. With some tweaking to the capture mechanics (i.e. make the ""de-capture"" effect scale with damage so that one little smg doesn't set you back all the way to square one.) it could make capture points feel like something worth actually contesting.   I often leave towers uncapped making an easy cap that will rez my team and the enemy can't stop via defense.   Which is great strategy, but something not always seen. Most people will still just take the tower regardless of team spawn status.   The problem with making tutorials now is that while it's in alpha they will have to keep redoing them.   I'm convinced that the name of this game is in fact ""Robocraft: Alpha"". :P But really, once they have the framework made for the tutorial screens, making new tutorials wouldn't be a monumental effort. It's development time being used wisely as you want people to understand and be drawn into your game. The first couple matches are important for player retention!"
Robocraft,3dvzxk,radyjko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:48 2015 UTC,"i always thought the cap points should be shot but on a swinging scale  starts purple and you shoot one big crystal to swing it to your color (in other games they usually have the base of the platform fill with color to show cap progress.  once you get it to 100% your color it becomes yours and the enemy has to swing it back 100% to their color to cap it  the reason i would like this is you could blast someone capping your tower then shoot it to swing it back to your side unlike the current system where you can't ""heal"" your damaged protonium"

Robocraft,3dxh78,Hegemott,4,Mon Jul 20 11:00:20 2015 UTC,"As a fairly new player, I'm going to have to agree with you because I had no idea what connection points were. There were a lot of game mechanics that I basically learned by guessing and trying things out."
Robocraft,3dxh78,ahage16,2,Mon Jul 20 12:18:42 2015 UTC,"That was my experience too. I think  there needs to be a ""everything you need to know to play"" link on the front page of the website or in the game itself."

Robocraft,3dxh78,DumberMonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:25 2015 UTC,Somewhere in the forum it was said that the plan is to replace the towers with capture zones.
Robocraft,3dxh78,DumberMonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:55 2015 UTC,yeah I know but I don't get what a capture zone is?
Robocraft,3dxh78,Psatch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"If you play Team Deathmatch (used to be classic mode) each team has a ""capture zone"" at their base. You capture the enemy base by stopping on top of a large disk in the ground -- if you're in the area then you will begin to capture the enemy base for victory. The more teammates you have in the capture zone, the faster your team will capture the enemy base. A similar mechanic was proposed to replace destroying crystals to capture towers in battle mode."
Robocraft,3dxh78,DumberMonkey,4,Mon Jul 20 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"oh. I like the crystals thing. I just think should have to destroy all of them instead of connection points.  If they want to do capture zone should be a different battle option. I like battle mode as it is. and they keep saying 5x as many play battle mode as play Team Death Match.  They need to be careful what they do..or they lose everyone.  There is a large silent majority they like Battle Mode and the reason they play robocraft.  I am all for appealing to the ""classic"" crowd..but not for ruining battle mode"

Robocraft,3dvys0,gairlok,3,Mon Jul 20 03:51:19 2015 UTC,What's wrong with acknowledging the potential of a good build?   It does exactly what it's supposed to do. I made a few changes that I think would improve it a bit. I also have 20 or so original bots. So again - what's wrong with copying a successful build?
Robocraft,3dvys0,gairlok,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:07:02 2015 UTC,"I've given your arguments some thought, and I find my initial reasons for disputing them to be weaker upon examination.  Plagiarism and the idea that an individual has a permanent and exclusive claim to their novel ideas has always been central to my moral compass. Society frowns upon it, punishes it, and I've adhered to those mores.  Appropriation, and improving upon a proven concept to make the application of a design ever more efficient is also one of my central tenants. It's innate to the discipline of engineering.   Surprisingly, these two concepts are at odds in RC: the community regularly invents new robot designs based upon game mechanic changes by FJ. RC players adopt, appropriate and sometimes plagiarize the designs of other players. The authors always share the design freely, because they lose nothing when others copy their designs, or even claim their designs as their own (plagiarism). The future feature of renting designs will be challenging this notion -but that's tangential.  I have to accept that there will always be a large body of players that will simply adopt the current flavor of the month, because there is simply no ethical reason for them not adopt it. Copycate players currently don't face much of a stigma in the RC community, only a minority of the player base disparage direct appropriation. In other creative gaming communities, this varies wildly -but that's tangential too. Also, there's a few popular members of the community that really enjoy creating builds to be copied; they truly have earned their popularity by the quality and creativity of their designs.  I think my joy in creating an original and effective designs has also created a negative expectation that if others don't share my enjoyment of discovering an original design, that they are ""doing it wrong."" That's a fallacy that I'll have to let go of. It's ok in Robocraft, and I really like Robocraft and its players."
Robocraft,3dvys0,djn808,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:30 2015 UTC,It's the optimal build for the current mechanics/meta.

If you tweak those trucks to be more robocraft inspired I could see this as an opening cinematic in the game.  I do have one question though. Why no teleportation? In the game that's how they ""land"" on the planet. It may not be as harrowing as the WWII style landing you've done, but the recognition of watching something in animation that we don't even pay attention to in the game would be worth it. Anyway good job regardless."

I do have a few questions.  1- i usually cover the BODY of the pilot (front part) and never really thought about covering his base. so is base a higher priority than the front? 2- I don't use white cubes in to build bot in Teir 4, but i do add some white cubes to fully protect it (and to fill cpu). you said ""your effective health is decided in large part by how much ON-TIER cubes and plates you're carrying around"".  does it mean i should not fill the spaces with white cubes at the end even if i can?"

Robocraft,3duooc,DeepMidWicket,3,Sun Jul 19 20:46:30 2015 UTC,"As a rail gunner this is how you deal with me on the other team.  Bot design: as others have said reinforce where you're pilot sits, also if I can see where on your bot the pilot is that's where ima shoot, the hardest to kill bots have either heaps of armour, covered in plates or have the pilot hidden so I'm not sure what bit to shoot.  Countering: the first few shots of an smg are very accurate, rails take a lot of cpu so I'm not going to be very tanky, also I can only have a max of 6 guns (without redundancy) so spamming me and knocking my guns of will force me to retreat and heal to remain effective in the battle.  Press Q! If you see me Q me, 8 times out of 10 if I get spotted I get met with your whole teams hatred, thus I must run away, often I will at least hang back until the Q has worn off.  Stay in a group, 1 on 1 at range you're my bitch, 3 on 1 at range I'll probably do some damage then be forced to run, 1 on 1 close range I'm most definitely your bitch, and when you get close don't fucking stop, my guns are slow to turn, if you're on the move close up I probably won't hit you.  If I hit you once get the fuck out, if you try and counter me but have to take a moment to find me I'll have fucked you already.  I have a max range, if you really don't like dealing with me stay to the other side of the map!  Hope this helps!"

That, coupled with Plasmas, means that you wouldn't need to expose yourself often, or can afford an EP recharge as in-between shots without losing much DPS.   A thruster stick is still going to drop like a brick from sustained fire or rail guns and needs a medic to recuperate. With EPs on Cluly's balls, not so much.

So megabots are about making gigantic targets to shoot at now? Why not use those huge cosmetic masks if area is what matters? EP heals six times slower per HP than cubes, and in a mega vs mega fight that is the ONLY stat that matters.      This can give you the edge in short burst fights but in extended battles a pure armor cube megabot will have the edge.   Excuse me but if you have fallen apart and are on 40% HP chasing after medics and the block enemy is on 90% and being healed superfast by his single medic where is your edge? This is how 'short burst fights' work with plate megas. The enemy will be able to rip off all your plates and tear into your structure in half the time it takes you to break their top armor layer, leaving you scrambling for cover and waiting for shield regen whilst they get back to 100% and engage your allies.      They are also useful for mounting guns onto due to their huge single component hp, multiple connection points and convenient shape.   NOW you're on to something useful. Still, remember that having so much CPU tied up in gun mounts severely limits your armor capabilities elsewhere on the bot.      Also their lighter than the same area of armor cubes to so they're invaluable on mega hovers.   My megahover made of roughly 1000 TX-1 cubes has never been beaten by a platebot, and is lighter than a platebot too.     In short, never EVER try to use plates as armor on megabots. Blocks are ALWAYS better. Plates can be used as gun mounts but come along with disadvantages."

Getting rewards beyond that requires exponentially more achievement. The ratio of Scoring:RP plummets.  Additionally, scoring for medics still sucks, and kill credit needs to be reworked."

Robocraft,3dtjdv,Onceuponaban,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:38:38 2015 UTC,"Bombers beat Ground movers, Ground Movers beat Rails, Rails beat Bombers   This is a gross oversimplification and doesn't hold up.  Some examples: Interceptors are usually great at air to air combat and poor at air to ground. Bombers can be very effective against light ground railers if they get the first strike."
Robocraft,3dtjdv,NotHomo,-5,Mon Jul 20 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"nothing will change until they remove rail and plasmas ability to kill or cripple people in one volley  oh i got hit by a rail gun, now i'm on the ground useless!  oh i got hit by a plasma, now i have no guns left!  it's a paradigm that doesn't ALLOW counterplay  fixes?   rails need to have standard cooldowns, not ""yay eat 6 shots at once!"".  there needs to be a state where the person on the receiving end gets hit by 1 rail shot and is able to then go ""hey a rail is targeting me, i will employ my counterplay and evade and hide"" plasmas need to fire sequentially like all other weapons.  no more of this ""lol i hit you with all 6 shots at once, where did your guns go?!"" nonsense.  furthermore, plasmas need to propagate damage the same as other weapons and not transmit THROUGH cubes and destroying connections.  the benefit of using plasma is that it's stupidly easy to hit ground targets with splash damage.  they shouldn't get the ability to effortlessly strip them of weapons and plating as well"
Robocraft,3dtjdv,AwesomeArab,3,Sun Jul 19 12:12:54 2015 UTC,"Well, there's already something that warns you that you're being targeted by a rail beforehand : their laser sight. Conveniently, this laser sight also pinpoint their location so you can blast them out of orbit yourself if you react quick enough. If you're hit, it's already too late.  As for plasma, I agree that damage going through cubes is a problem, but making them fire sequentially could seriously hurt bombers. Plasma bots already have to deal with having the only weapon where they have to lead their shots."
Robocraft,3dtjdv,NotHomo,-2,Sun Jul 19 12:43:15 2015 UTC,"so you can blast them out of orbit yourself if you react quick enough   no, because they get to sit in the shield and shoot across the map   but making them fire sequentially could seriously hurt bombers   kinda the point.  instead of them getting to fire and flee, they would actually have to deal DAMAGE OVER TIME and keep their targets locked in for an extended period in order to deal their damage.  you would see bombing RUNS instead of endless weaving in the air with sporadic dumping of huge damage  the two changes work in concert with each other.  bombers have to stick around in the air in order to deal their damage.  and rails can no longer dump all their damage at once, but now have targets that aren't weaving all over the sky REQUIRING them to be able to dump 6 shots instantly and kill it  you lower the threat potential of both, making the gameplay and counterplay actually exist"
Robocraft,3dtjdv,AwesomeArab,2,Sun Jul 19 12:52:28 2015 UTC,"kinda the point. instead of them getting to fire and flee, they would actually have to deal DAMAGE OVER TIME and keep their targets locked in for an extended period in order to deal their damage. you would see bombing RUNS instead of endless weaving in the air with sporadic dumping of huge damage     Do you know what a bombing run is? It's a term coined after the world wars when bombers would fly over, drop all their bombs at once and leave. Except they had to do it slightly sequentially because they simply couldnt drop that many bombs at once, and didnt want to concentrate their damage so much. They were attacking buildings, and lots of them at once. We are attacking single objects, either bots or towers, so we DO want to drop our load in one shot. With your idea, none but the most resilient of bombers are going to survive. no room for bombers that are faster but weaker. WE'RE BACK TO THE GUNBED PROBLEM. Being a tankier bot should not and will not be the only way to play. Hit and runs are why we have plasma, its the only weapon that can."
Robocraft,3dtjdv,NotHomo,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:19:27 2015 UTC,"so we DO want to drop our load in one shot   no counterplay = bad design.  we don't care what you WANT  i bet SMGS would love to be able to shoot all their guns instantly at the same time as well.  maybe we should give them ""what they want"""
Robocraft,3dtjdv,Onceuponaban,4,Sun Jul 19 13:26:20 2015 UTC,"Since you have no argument and you simply want to poke at my choice of words. Fine, when I said Want I meant the situation in which Bombers fight in allows for higher success with burst damage instead of continuous. Or WANT for short. Happy? Likewise the situation in which SMGs fight allows for higher success with continuous damage instead of Burst.

The shit I'm seeing in tier 10 is too much to bear right now. Back in the day when you build something so shitty you get your ass handed to you by NPC bots, you know that you suck and you have to bring something better. Nowadays some robots people bring in matches makes me wonder... ""Have they no shame?"""
Robocraft,3dsfeg,Khoakuma,8,Sun Jul 19 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"Or when you get your ass handed to you in a match, you had to pay repair costs and you got little to no net RP. It kept less experienced people in lower tiers. Im not saying bring back the repair cost, and I admit that they were a little high, but there needs to be something to balance the amount of RP people get with how well they play.  If you ask me, you should NOT get double the RP as someone who did the exact same thing but their team lost. There should be a small win bonus or loss penalty but having payouts based more on individual performance will force people to play better or progress slower so that they can get the experience they need to play better."
Robocraft,3dsfeg,ElegantBiscuit,0,Sun Jul 19 05:41:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe repair cost is a good idea actually... well, in the core essence of it, cuz obviously that don't work for battle mode. Maybe some cost for dying a lot? Wait no that's bad for me cuz I'm a manly player (reads idiot) with no regard for conservative play and will charge head first into 3 person if i get the chance... hmm.  Maybe just based on score performance. Remember my minimum threshold idea? If you end the match under certain score (the threshold based on how much time elapsed, to make sure ending the game early don't hurt everybody) , you gain very little to no RP. I do feel like we need to avoid the old""lose RP from accidentally doing badly"" scenario, that kinda ""KILL THE FUN AND CREATIVITY IN ROBOCRAFT AND FORCE EVERYONE TO BUILD SOMETHING GOOD OMFG IM QUITTING THIS GAME!!!111!!!"" (heheh), but some people just deserve no reward whatsoever from a match."
Robocraft,3dsfeg,Khoakuma,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:05:44 2015 UTC,I think RP based solely on performance with a small win bonus or loss penalty should be fine.   I tried a game out with my friend once where we had no weapons and only spotted and used radars. We both would have gotten ~80k RP from that game (with premium). For doing nothing but spotting. I actively went around spotting but he just flew to the enemy base and went AFK right near the enemy base in a hidden corner and spotted people with radars. I think thats saying a lot. Maybe RP rewards need to be reduced a little.

Robocraft,3dsfeg,fortifiedoranges,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:39 2015 UTC,"Balancing a hover is very much like balancing on a tight rope. If your weight shifts just a little bit your while bot will fall to the ground and limp around. You also have to be very conscious about where you place hovers, too narrow and your bot will rock back and forth like a boat, too wide and one hit will put you on the ground. If one of our hovers get taken out, the rest of them cannot compensate balance or speed. If rotors had similar properties, unbalanced copters would act much like a real copter if you took a rotor off. It would spin and plummet until it crashed. That's what real copters do, and that's what hovers do."

Robocraft,3dsrrz,Shaftronics,5,Sun Jul 19 07:36:35 2015 UTC,"1) Rails are huge. Without using guides or copying a build, they're not easy to fit 6 on without some sort of sacrifice or compromise. This also means that they're easy to be shot off by SMGs and Plasmas.  2) Long reloads and volley firing. This means they're strictly rear-line vehicles. They can't sustain a flank like an SMG can. They don't have the one-shot burst a plasma user has. They need to expose themselves for a minimum of 0.3 seconds a shot.  3) Slow turning. Any movement by the rail cannon increases it's bloom by a considerable amount. Get ambushed and you're screwed.  4) Limited movement options. Other than walkers and choppers, other methods of movement aren't as effective. Treads don't give you the adaptability. Hovers wobble and don't anchor you while shooting. Wheels aren't as mobile/adaptable.  Spotters? 60% of the time, I'm spotting for myself."
Robocraft,3dsrrz,Djens58,2,Sun Jul 19 03:19:06 2015 UTC,"Might be just me, but I really, really enjoy playing with rails on my flyer. It's designed to disable/kill bombers and copters, does the job better than an Interceptor. It has six railguns and a few Tesla blades on front to finish off a target once they drop on the ground. The Tesla blades also give the option tot attack ground units: dive towards target > fire six shots > finish target with Tesla. It might not be the most efficiënt way to use them, but it's so much fun."
Robocraft,3dsrrz,burntcustard,2,Sun Jul 19 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"I used to think railguns were very low skilled weapons, but I've more-or-less changes my mind. Rails take skill. Here's a few special things that proficient rail gunners will do:  Aim in between shields (this is kinda new and I like it), or at your guns, or at movement parts, to stop you getting to them, or to stop you running away >:)  Aim at the predicted location of the pilot seat, and figure out if it's better to go for this or shoot all 6 of your rotors/guns off. When playing in a platoon with my clan, we call out weak spots like ""shoot this guy right in the center 3 times and he pops"".  Shoot perfectly straight while in the air. If rails aren't zoomed in and aren't rotating on their mounts, this is a thing, and you should be afraid.  All this being said, I really hope view distance goes up a bit. When playing at rails, half the time I'm just aiming for name tags, and it's not really fun for either me or my enemy."

Robocraft,3dsrrz,gairlok,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:19:43 2015 UTC,"In addition to playing rails, a huge advantage you need to learn to compensate for is positioning. Rail cannon players can only thrive on the map when they know the angles of approach and can anticipate your movement. They will use cover, snipe you, and hide. You can counter this by using unexpected angles of approach, really know the map, know the speed your bot can move from cover to cover, and using a jammer to prevent detection from their passive radar (if they have one).  I have a jammer & radar on all my bots JUST BECAUSE OF THIS MECHANIC. It serves me well every single match. Enemies will momentarily pop up on my minimap with a ""bzzt"" noise when my radar detects them, even through terrain and out of line of site. I use this to flank them, ambush them, burst damage them before they can fire back... and then hide again.   Learn it, love it, profit by it."
Robocraft,3dsrrz,gairlok,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:06:39 2015 UTC,P.S. This tactic really serves those speedy tesla medic/sniper/smg bots that fly. They murder non-agile rail cannon bots.
Robocraft,3dsrrz,yesennes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:10:05 2015 UTC,"I'd bet you never played rail for two reasons:  1: You say they take no skill. Whether they are OP or fun is up for debate, but they do take skill.  2: You say Receivers/Jammers are useless. People don't always spot, especially planes over their heads. As a rail, I found receivers and jammers to be very useful. Sometimes I even used no radar and relied on receivers."
Robocraft,3dsrrz,xVoidray,0,Sun Jul 19 04:17:58 2015 UTC,"Went to try rail for the first time today being a plasma only person. Sat behind my shield pointed up for air, got a few easy insta at the start got a ton of oc levels and after that was just easy raping of anyone I see. And since the map is so open I insta people half the map away. EPs were barely a problem since most builds don't completely cover their entire bot so just shoot in between. Kinda got boring after a few games since I easily insta people. Thus gotta agree that rails are no skill and r no fun. Either that or I'm really good even tho it's my first rail game. And imo those saying it takes skill, its more of common sense than skill. There no hard skill like tapping to maintain accuracy at the fastest practical speed for smgs or leading target from range with plasma"

As a rail walker player even before the recent damage buff, aerial plasma are the least fun type of bots to play against. The fact that rails are freaking huge makes rail bots usually glass cannons with fairly few options of defense.  I like to compare robocrafts weapons to handheld weapons. Smgs are the assault rifles, decent at range, deadly up close. Plasma is the contact grenade launcher, one shot badly aimed can still fuck you up bad. Rails are the sniper rifles, deadly at range when they are left alone, but as soon as a sniper is discovered they have to move, only being effecting when not harassed. Tesla is the commando with a machete, gotta get right up in your face to kill you. And nanos are outta this world.  All in all, fuck plasma and fuck plasma"

Robocraft,3dsrrz,asdfth12,-1,Sun Jul 19 08:44:09 2015 UTC,"As a railer, this is my breakdown on movement types and how hard it is to hit them.  Walkers and tanks are easy enough to lead and hit due to how slow they move. Walkers though get the dildo end of the stick though since it's easier to hit a leg then it is a tread due to a lack of armoring.    Standard wheels are mostly they same, although they do move faster so they are thus a bit harder to lead and hit.   Hovers can be a bit tricky due to ascending and decending, though a good rule of thumb is to aim above or under them depending on their elevation to counter them in case they try ascending or decending to dodge.  Helicopters are a aerial unit which can rapidly ascend and decend, but their movement patterns are generally easily discernable and thus leadable. The general goal against them is to pop the rotors to drop them, though doing such can make their movement pattern unpredictable. The skill isn't in shooting the helicopter the first time, the skill is in managing to hit the bastard once it starts spinning around randomly. If they are ascending and decending at random it does make it harder to hit you, though in this case hover tactics would apply. The exception to this is units that are equipped with more rotors then we are rail cannons (And may those that use choppers like this be cursed with connection issues)  And now we come to planes - The class rails were originally intended to counter, and arguably the class that is the hardest for us to actually counter. In the hands of a skilled pilot, they can have a truely unpredictable pattern, thusly making them impossible to hit. In cases like this, the only real way is for multiple rails to focus their fire on them and hope that one of us is able to land a lucky hit on them. Honestly, if the air units pilot is skilled enough then the only way a rail will manage to nail them is if they get a little flak special from the SMGs first. That said, a skilled pilot with a Eplate equipped unit is by far our most hated sight.  Lets start with satellites. If you're a stationary satilite and come against a railer with even the smallest amount of skill, well... put as simply as I can, you're fucked. No if, ands or buts about it. It's only a matter of when, and being completely honest here the only time we'll focus our attention specifically on you over other targets is if you make the mistake of hitting us. (If you do this, it's as the Kohr-ah would say - Your death was inevitable, BUT NOW IT IS ALSO IMMINENT!) Of course, if we see you and don't have other more pressing concerns (Read - anything else to shoot) we're more then willing to put a round into you, but most of the time stationary sats aren't worth spending a round.   Now we come to the mobile satilites. Long story short, properly built and in skilled hands they are twice as annoying as fliers and about three times harder to hit. The only upside is that most mobile sats take a round worse then a air unit, though that still requires us to actually get a feel on your movement patterns first. (And while I'm thinking about it, may the basketball sats be cursed with connection issues too.  One thing I didn't mention earlier in relation to walkers, jumping. We know you can jump, and you jumping will can make us miss a shot but most railers worth half a damn will lead you after the jump and put a round into you after you land. If we are feeling particularly mean that day, we'll blow off most of your legs and watch you flop around like a fish out of water for a bit. That said the walker/tread hybrid is annoying, especially if the leg is internalized.  Anyway, the most important rule to rails? Location location location. That said, some locations are better then others, and I don't think I need to mention what map has the best layout for snipers.   tl:dr - While rails were meant to counter air units, with how they are implimented it's easier for us to take out the slower stuff."

Just make each npc bot worth %5 (or less, whatever) the normal RP value for destroying it in a multiplayer match. This will truly encourage a new player to try out the game with very little risk, fear, embarrassment, etc.  Once they understand that they can gain mastery of the gameplay, get a tiny reward for doing it, it will generate goodwill for the ""real thing.""

Robocraft,3dknks,Narissis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:56:14 2015 UTC,"Step 1: Make the core of your bot  Step 2: Throw some rotors and thrusters on it. As a rule of thumb, your bot should be symmetrical, and keep a good balance of rotors around your center of mass.   Step 3: Slap on weapons and electroplates, editing your bot if needed.  Step 4: Go to the practice map and make sure your bot functions ok.   Step 5: You're done! Make sure to upgrade the cubes on your bot as needed and reinforce the parts which get blown off most frequently!  My strategy: At the start of the game, I immediately fly to the tower and capture it. After that, I follow my team and try to get some early kills. I fit SMGs on my copter, and use my enhanced mobility and speed to support my team, by rushing to fights to help, killing snipers, rushing around the map capturing towers, dueling plasma bombers and dropping out of the sky, guns blazing to execute enemy bots.   Make sure to use mountains as cover against snipers, be constantly on the lookout for enemy bots, spot everything you can, be aware of what's happening on the map so you know where to go or not go, immediately take evasive maneuvers when you get spotted or get sniped/see the laser beam, and KEEP MOVING.

Robocraft,3dpy2x,Masamune00,3,Sat Jul 18 08:34:44 2015 UTC,"you're a railgunner.  and I would assume a grounded railgunner. Railgunner can't carry games no matter how good or how fed. You would always need that solid front line to push down the enemy reactor, or at least establish a safe zone where you can advance closer to the enemy base.  Unfortunately most of the time the rest of your team are headless chickens piloting ""mobile tactical"" bullcrap that can't survive half a plasma barrage and can't even take 15% off a SMG tank before dying. Try flying/long jumping railer though, if you can get in and out of the enemy shield and poke the reactor with massive amount of damage, it's a lot better.  But I think you know this. People, this is why we need tanky builds. I'm pretty sure it's considered hipster by the point to build tanky, since everyone wants to be cool and dart around aimlessly not being able to contest anything. I'm not even asking everyone to be 900+ block tank, just do anything you want, as long as you're able to tank 2 full plasma barrage and remains functional, you're set (looking at you medics who thinks ""it make no sense to build a tanky medic"")."

Robocraft,3dqa5l,Pocok5,4,Sat Jul 18 12:54:17 2015 UTC,"No, you are literally saying you refuse to contribute to the team effort and leave them entirely because the enemy has an actual effective air defence. Out of the hundreds of flyers I saw none of them were whining because we didin't let them just fly around completely unharmed while they plasmabombed our entire team. They got shot apart, they respawned and they tried again, and a lot of them were incredibly effective even when I was driving my specialized AA tank. Half the flyers I see are actually remarkably sturdy and can weather a four shot salvo from a T7 rail without falling out of the sky. Also, those pilots realized the value of this fancy thing called ""cover"" because who said you must fly around at max height? You so generously 'allow' SMGs take potshots at you because you likely have a plane covered in electroplates and you can escape unharmed after every assault."

Map knowledge. Learn it. Love it. Start wrecking rails. Even if it means taking the longest and least-taken routes just to get the jump on one, do it. It'll help you and your team. Seriously, though, a majority of the rails I've played against never see coming a flyer that's coming from an area not containing a fusion tower.   It seems you don't understand that rails are the counter to anything air-related, especially bombers. If you want to survive the flight back to base, review your current bomber(s). Look at the wings and thrusters. Will a meatshot or glancing blow shoot off a flight surface? Triforce your wings if need be. I'm ditching an old design from T6 because I never took into account triforcing wings, especially with my deaths skyrocketing with how crazy my plays have been.    I feel your pain, though. Last night I had two winning games in T9 that topped the death counter (~13-15 deaths) because I, in my T8-armored bomber, was the only one crazy enough to throw myself into--and eventually behind--their line of fire so they couldn't camp near mid. I missed most of my shots because I was so pissed, but I didn't care and my teams were clearly struggling, and I eventually shooed them off so that we could eventually win...after at least 20 minutes."

This means you can sneak up then blast them without them seeing you. And if they sit in the shield? Fly to them! Take a little used route and fly behind them.

It would also make blocks highly customizable and the tiering system would just be in values of the block's stats (they could easily add tiers in future patches).

Robocraft,3dk904,karbengo,6,Thu Jul 16 23:08:43 2015 UTC,"This fight was hard. Both megas where plasmas and there was only two SMG in my team for AA duty. I am not exaggerating by saying we both kept enemy aircrafts -including a Tstick platoon- at bay, at least I was shooting at the sky the whole time...  I am happy we ended up winning, this was a very tense game for me, but looking at this chart I feel down for how much sweat inducing that match was just to land in the middle of the board.  I feel like this is one reason nobody bothers to shoot at fliers, it's a frustrating experience that does not reward as much as pounding the ground, yet it is vital to the success of a battle. Even whit tap fire, most SMG shots inevitably fly past the target, but there is no second line behind it to soak up stray shots. Less hits = less damage = less reward/  Something should be done about it to entice more people to watch out for aircrafts. Make them more attractive target, reward ground to air hit -they require more skill than ground to ground after all- or give us a proper AA weapon that makes AA duty less frustrating for everyone."
Robocraft,3dk904,s9meNiNE,2,Thu Jul 16 23:16:08 2015 UTC,"proper AA weapon   Well, we already have rails which work great as AA IMO. I just wish the match-making would take ground-air balance into account, e.g. ensure at least one rail on the team if there are many enemy aircraft."
Robocraft,3dk904,billiarddaddy,2,Fri Jul 17 15:46:16 2015 UTC,"The problem is still the same I believe. There is nothing preventing a railer to shoot ground instead of air.

Robocraft,3dk904,Cluly,2,Thu Jul 16 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"A thought occurred to me, what about this: reward glancing blows. Give a few amount of RP for shots that go very closely past an enemy target.

If I do a good job of suppressing air fire, we win.  Air bots are slower to take towers.  You just have to assign one or 2 gnd guys to do nothing but shoot the air targets.

Too often I see entire teams getting trashed by 2 or 3 bombers, simply because there are juicier targets about that will net you points. Most players can't see the win for the points.  A few Things that don't help:  -Only one weapon is designed with anti-air in mind. Chances are 80% of your team is unable to deal with air.  -All weapons (including the only AA weapon) can damage ground.  -Even if you do manage to land a crippling blow, the target is likely back in the air in under 30 seconds.  Problem:  Air is not food for ground.  Ground is food for air.  Air is not food for air.  Ground is food for ground.  Solution?  Make thrusters and wings more expensive so air is easier to kill.

It's smoother, provide a larger distribution curve for weapons to get easier balanced as well. What I want to see is that tier 10 weaponry (or top level weaponry, however the new system works) remains strong enough to justify using them over smaller, less CPU extensive versions. Otherwise you would have 20 t3 sized SMGs gunbed mowing down the battlefield, and I'm sure most of you would dislike seeing that.

I think a better solution would be to leave armors as-is, implement the paint, and have a button you can push in the garage to temporarily remove the paint so you can tell which armor is which."
Robocraft,3dilrt,MushrooomSamba,2,Thu Jul 16 17:33:29 2015 UTC,"Yes! Exactly. We do NOT need to redesign any of the existing block tiers, we just need the ability to paint over them with colors that are unlocked by player level. This is so simple, a no-brainer.

Ideally, we could have more above this. Since defense tends to be 70-80% of total CPU on most ground bots (about 40-60% on air), more options on how to spend that lion's share of CPU is good. e.g. varied types of plate, blocks that have different damage propagation properties, blocks that slowly regenerate other blocks attached to it, etc."

This removes a lot of the design balancing decisions you have to make as you move your bot up the power scale - having to balance how much armor of what tier against where you want your bot to fall in the tiers/RR scale. You have to choose what to make hard spots on the armor and where it can be soft, where to start upgrading once you get access to a new tier, balancing the weight of a lower tier against the armor of a higher tier.   We wouldn't be getting more options, we'd be getting fewer. Why should I be in favor of fewer options when the trade off only nets a cosmetic upgrade? Fuck that."

Similar will be done to weapons and movement parts. It adds choices by removing vertical tier progression. These choices are unlocked by level progression.  So time spent in game would unlock a wider variety of options to build."
Robocraft,3dilrt,Braneth,0,Sat Jul 18 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"No, that would still remove build options. Fewer parts means fewer options. This is mathematical fact. The more the tiers of the various parts there are, the more you can fine-tune exactly how you want your bot to perform and what RR/tier it will be.   So, no, you're not getting more options. You're getting fewer. It's oversimplification bullshit.   You're going to go from 11 tiers to 4 tiers. The only thing that's going to change is how long you're stuck with sub-T10 armor cubes."

Robocraft,3dilrt,NextArtemis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:10:36 2015 UTC,"I suppose one of the concerns I have is whether or not these new armor classifications will have any value in high-rank play.  To date, we all use T10 cubes on our bots for maximum armor, health, and general durability. Using cubes of a lower tier in T10 is almost certainly a death sentence.  However, should these new cube tiers have some relevance in the meta, light bots could be fast as hell, but can't take as much of a hit, medium could be mobile, deal plenty of damage, and take a few hits, and heavy could be the front-line instigators.  I'm curious to see whether or not these new cube groupings will have relevance in the meta, or if it will still be Heavy cubes and TX1 cubes being the standard once you come to obtain them."
Robocraft,3dilrt,boybrushedplad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:06:51 2015 UTC,"I can't get behind this idea. The colors are great, but this is basically saying the game will completely change over one update. The devs are proposing to go from 11 tiers of armor to 4. That severely limits the amount of creativity you can have. The minimum/maximum armor already hurt a player's ability to have freedom making their bot but this is another step towards robocraft lite.   The whole selling point of this game is the customization balanced with the building skill. This idea further removes the building skill and only minimally increases the customization portion."

Robocraft,3dilrt,TheCurryNinja,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:15:55 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing a good deal of concern about how a paltry four tiers / shades of armor reduces the overall number of combinations possible. Indeed, this will probably mean that there will be ""crests"" where certain levels of weapons become the standard for your main choice in armor tier, e.g. medium armor is most effective when you're using T5 weapons.   Consider, however, how dull a process it is to upgrade armor when we cross tiers (many would recommend to start from scratch, actually). Having less armor tiers means less swapping of cubes, and more adding armor / using stronger armor in choice places. This is what players do in T10 already.  The spectrum of micro-tiers would be affected by the ratio of weaker armor to stronger armor you're using, plus the number and strength of your weapons. Frankly, having definitive weak points in armor sounds a lot more interesting than having on-tier armor up against on-tier weapons every tier. Players already know to aim for darker points on robots, the parts which have received damage (good design choice, FJ).   Wait, did you catch that...? On-tier weapons vs. on-tier armor, every tier... If I'm not mistaken, more tiers of armor implies less variety in robot armor."

Robocraft,3dilrt,NotHomo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"They already have in mind ""delta"" values, which I assume they use to compare the effectiveness of armor and weapons as players tier-up. I believe there is going to be a smaller damage-improvement/armor-improvement gap between ""T10"" players and ""T1"" players with FJ's proposed update compared to how the game is now. Instead of a T10 SMG doing like 10x the damage of a T1 SMG (just making this up), it'll probably be more like 3x the damage or 5x the damage. With lower ""delta"" values, matches will be more forgiving when matching players because there will be smaller differences in ability between players in a  larger pool, which in turns means that roboranking does not have to be as precise as one may think because it won't matter as much (though it should still be precise)! FJ is probably going to start with some reasonable slighty arbitrary values, test them on us, and then ongoingly modify the values as to keep things balanced as more content is produced."

Robocraft,3dk2o6,TheF0CTOR,3,Thu Jul 16 22:19:23 2015 UTC,I've been getting this more and more often lately (it feels like) and is very annoying. Realistically its like 1 game a night.  For me its only towers (one per game when it happens) and not necessarily when I die. I've had it sometimes that the bug happens right in the middle of trying to cap a tower.
Robocraft,3dk2o6,Tussca,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:42:23 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling. I get disconnected so much from the game, and im to pissed to wait for the timer to end, so i just play something else."

After my team cap it (and the enemy recaps) I can hit it again."
Robocraft,3dk2o6,cebeide,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:41:03 2015 UTC,Same here as a medic this is very infuriating when I can't help the team by capturing that one tower that is keeping the enemy shield up
Robocraft,3dk2o6,DMZ_5,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:58:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, this bug is really frustrating. It's the worst when you're by yourself capping a tower, no enemies in sight. You get one side of connection points and half of the other side, then BAM, you can no longer destroy crystals until you respawn, you didn't cap the tower, and now the enemy is headed straight to you. This is something Freejam should release immediate hot fixes for instead of waiting for every big update."
Robocraft,3dk2o6,afterooster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, same thing happened to me. As the other posters pointed out, only happens for one tower at a time. Quite annoying, but since your team can still cap it not as bad as I.e. the glitxched tower bug where a capped tower just doesn't change color.  If it happens to me I try to get a different tower and tell my teammates about the problem.  Also happens with any type of weapon, smg, plasma, nano. ( don't know about rail, don't use it)"

Robocraft,3dk2o6,radyjko,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:22:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I had that once.  Worse thing about it i was in a platoon on voice being yelled at for not damaging the crystals. I tried a respawn and didn't help.  Then later a platoon guy couldn't damage his crystals (on certain towers). needless to say we lost  horribly.  Only happened one game..last week I think.

Robocraft,3dj5oe,TheArtBotGuyZD1,-3,Fri Jul 17 19:18:31 2015 UTC,This competition should really be remade since threedawg moved robots in catagories after voting had started. Giving many robots an advantage and a disadvantage to others. And the fact he failed to clearly post rules and guidelines leaving out tons of good submissions disqualifying them after the fact. 20 posts or more about this issue have been deleted. Sounds like he's trying cover up the problems maybe to rig the competition?
Robocraft,3dj5oe,22GoixYT,3,Sat Jul 18 02:46:17 2015 UTC,"What? Who did I move? Who did I miss?  In what post were the rules not posted?  You realize I am the one running the competition right?  If I wanted to rig it, I would have just not started the comp and got the prize for myself."
Robocraft,3dj5oe,Juvar23,-4,Sat Jul 18 06:10:31 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree this deserves a remake.  Firstly commenting on the thread ""use imgir"" is NOT a clear direction that your only accepting images from IMGIR And PM'ing me ""Please post on imgir"" or putting that same sentence in a reply on the thread don't indicate that steam submissions would be disqualified. Secondly you FAILED to put that Information out to the public in the Competition Post. All you had to say have was one sentence. ""Images will only be accepted from Imgir, other submissions will be disqualified."" But you didn't. Its called being direct and clear, heck you could have even sent me a whole sentence on steam. "" The fact that you ignored this because you are just that lazy, and still bitching about not getting in is unreal."" Its not laziness on my part what it is, you failed to do your job because YOU were to lazy to copy hyper links from steam and failed to put out clear directions. Even though someones deleting all the posts from people about your failure to host a fair contest. I do hope flubber pulls the prizes from this competition until you remake this. Like he said before someone deleted his comment. Also after the competition and voted had started you've been switching people in catagories, this seems like a clear disadvantage to those players a second reason this should be remade."
Robocraft,3dj5oe,hobo24,8,Fri Jul 17 19:58:14 2015 UTC,"You need to let it go. You failed to respond to threedawgs attempt to warn you that you need to use imgur. If he asked you to use imgur in a pm, that should tell you that you need to put it onto imgur.  You failed YOUR JOB of getting your entry in the correct way, threedawg did everything he could do correctly.  Also, flubber's donations are no longer accepted, and it seems that he deleted his reddit account. So unless you want to get everything you wrote deleted aswell, you might want to stop trash talking the host of the FREE CONTEST of which you owe nothing. It is all your fault for not uploading it to imgur when he asked, and now you are trying to blame him for your mistakes.

Robocraft,3dj5oe,Juvar23,2,Fri Jul 17 14:04:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. this seeding system might work in a way that more popular bots kick each other before final, because they had most upvotes and were placed together.

Robocraft,3dfwwn,utfanx2,2,Thu Jul 16 01:42:50 2015 UTC,"The only downside to this is that legs do not overclock for speed, only jump height. If you use this in battle, you will move painfully slow compared to other tanks. It works fine in classic, if only a tad slower than treads alone.   Fortunately, you can disable the leg by holding space. However, at high overclock the jump will take a long time to recover from. Again, I would only recommend this for classic.  Here is an old build using the same concept with a single tread and leg to maximize cpu for guns. Here is the last screenshot I took before removing the leg after the meta update."

Before this last update you never saw purple t9 blocks in t10, now more than half of all t10 bots primarily use them, which isn't that big of a deal if you know how to play, but there are so many t10 players who just blindly charge the enemy with no regard for anyone but themselves.

In place of plasma we do Healers, Gun bed, Rail.  but if your SMG guy will shoot air targets, then the last plasma works fine.  Have to be on coms (voice). That is more important then what bots.  Being on voice is the biggest. We have won matches we would have lost but being on voice allowed us to do things we couldn't otherwise.   One of my favorites is drawing fire away from the tower with a well well tanked gun bed (preferably with a healer).  I have been on games were are losing and did that..and while most of the red teams tries to kill the the suicide smg (moving away from the tower during battle) the rest of the blues descend on their reactor and finish it.    Have also warned people off. ""dont come after me, I will be dead in a few seconds"".  All the reds are on the middle tower, rush the reactor.

Robocraft,3dj6of,ThunderLuigi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:26:14 2015 UTC,I would say a Medic hover that accompanies a Gunbed purely made by blocks.  A sniper spider and some sort of flyer pribabky a bomber. Interceptor is good though too.
Robocraft,3dj6of,AwesomeArab,0,Fri Jul 17 18:50:03 2015 UTC,"One of each of the most popular types of bots out there. You at least need a fast Nano hover and an SMG tank/hover to lead and serve as a core for the rest of the platoon to fall back on. You'll need an aerial unit, either a Rail copter/flyer-walker or a Plasma bomber to scout for the team. If you can put four people on your platoon, put both on. Keep your medic alive, and communicate any changes in the battlefield. Everyone should be able to fight out of their traditional roles if need be."

They will compare the retention of deathmatch and battle players and make their move from there."

Robocraft,3dflqj,PM_QUIL0N_SPAM,10,Wed Jul 15 21:56:42 2015 UTC,"I think a better solution to the progression is lets us see the actual RR number. It'll be the prominent factor when building our bots and match making so I think it should be displayed.  It also would help platoons. Instead of averaging the RR in a platoon and causing a low RR bot go into a high RR match make it so other bots who join a platoon have to be within a RR spectrum of the leader. Lets say the leader has a RR of 1000 then any bot wishing to join must be between 900-1100 RR. This ensures all those bots will be very close in RR with the bots in the rest of the match.  This will allow progression to be seen, fix platoons, and allow us to accurately gauge how strong our bot is."
Robocraft,3dflqj,FugiATX,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a better idea, however the RR that would be shown would have to be Log(RR) in order to keep the numbers from being obnoxiously large."
Robocraft,3dflqj,FugiATX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:43:51 2015 UTC,"They mentioned about redoing RR, so I assume the numbers at the moment would be scaled down highly.

It really depends on what numbers they can assign the parts to fit with everything."

Instead of a ""tier 10"" battle, you'd have a team of 980, 975, and six 960 against a team of eight 975s, or something.  If ELO is worked in well, you might even see an 875 instead of 975 on the second team, and everyone knows that player must be good to be matched with more powerful bots."
Robocraft,3dflqj,Onceuponaban,2,Wed Jul 15 22:51:01 2015 UTC,This is exactly my thought! It would be obvious when a T8 played with T10's that the T8 was very skilled.

Robocraft,3ddht3,Gecko4Eidechse,4,Wed Jul 15 12:29:48 2015 UTC,"Everyone suggesting ""just allow dyes"" is not thinking about the interface and input work that would need to be done.  Would there be a color wheel, hex input box, color dropper (to pick the color you're pointing at), paint brush, paint bucket...?  Every interface takes a lot of time to develop and I think we all know Freejam doesn't like to change the interface, and when they do it takes them ages.  Heck, we JUST got map pings and we've been begging for that for like a year.  Further down in that forum thread, Mark talked about having 1-cpu, 2-cpu, and 3-cpu blocks with increasing armor values (and possibly weights?)...  Maybe the 3-cpu blocks have 3x the armor?  I don't know the best solution, but Mark's ideas seem to be geared toward as little interface work as possible."
Robocraft,3ddht3,Getterac7,7,Wed Jul 15 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"I would much rather FreeJam spend their time designing a new interface than uproot the entire balance model for something purely cosmetic. While the coding of the interface may take time the idea is vastly less complicated then trying to balance the armour/health of every item.   While I understand the concern for building an interface it seems this idea is really taking the long way to fix a very simple problem. I think they are very much capable of changing/building a new interface with the right idea. They made several iterations of the battle que, the battle information bar, statics screen, player information blimps, repairing, and in the new update this month I'm sure a lot of interface work will be done as well with the removal of the tiers."
Robocraft,3ddht3,FugiATX,2,Thu Jul 16 04:20:15 2015 UTC,"I think that would be the more proper solution over a incredibly massive, core balance change, just to get colorful bots."

That's strategy, that's calculation, that's good gameplay. I don't care about cosmetic bots because this is a game about making robots with big guns that kill things.   I'm fine if people want to make their robot look pretty, maybe add a secondary color to reach tier of armour or make each tier have a basic cube and an armour cube and a fancy cube. This isn't a game about pixel art, or at least it shouldn't be imo. This is a game about skillfully crafting a robot killing machine in your garage and blasting your opponents to pieces."

Robocraft,3ddht3,thekasrak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:20:33 2015 UTC,"That's why I said every cube has it's tier level printed on it, so you can spot where a possible weakness in the bot is.  This number however should be toggleable so that you don't see any numbers on any bot. Other users who have this number activated can see still yours. So that way players can decide if they want to see the numbers to spot a weakness or if they want the game to just look aesthetically pleasant."

Robocraft,3ddht3,boybrushedplad,3,Wed Jul 15 12:40:53 2015 UTC,"maybe you could keep the colors of the blocks the same as the default, and as you unlock new levels, it unlocks that level's color for all other tiers of blocks."
Robocraft,3ddht3,afterooster,2,Wed Jul 15 22:50:50 2015 UTC,They could make the armor of the full cubes proportional to their weight:  The white cubes would have 5 armor and the black ones 15.
Robocraft,3ddht3,Stigawub,2,Wed Jul 15 14:33:17 2015 UTC,"But you're even still referring to the armor by its color.  It would have to be the heavy block is 15 the light block is 5,  and then we would have no way of knowing which block is which."
Robocraft,3ddht3,vtxAishi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:41:33 2015 UTC,Doesn't work once you get to tx-1 cubes which weigh 1/4 the weight of t10 cubes (3kg for tx-1 and 15kg for t10) but have a much higher armor rating. Going by weight would mean that anyone with tx-1 cubes(the strongest cubes in the game) on their bot would now have one of the weakest armors available on their bot.
Robocraft,3ddht3,Pamela4,2,Thu Jul 16 02:44:32 2015 UTC,I think we just need more carbon 6 like cubes for t10 to add extra colors

Secondly, on mark's side, I dislike removing the weight differences on the bots once they remove tiers. If you keep the weights in place, smaller bots suffer because they can't be anchored down by ""high quality, low quantity"" armor.

We’d like to make the game ‘more intuitive’ if possible and easier to get into (but still hard to master).

Robocraft,3dct8r,NotHomo,3,Wed Jul 15 12:12:54 2015 UTC,"you forgot this part: 4. So, why not make all 1 CPU cubes have the same armor value. White, Black, Heavy, Windshield, all the same"
Robocraft,3dct8r,SlypEUW,2,Wed Jul 15 13:18:14 2015 UTC,"no i'm saying the math isn't linear like that.  you can't just say if it takes X time for a T1 gun to kill a T1 bot with 500 cubes, it will take him 3X the time to kill a T1 bot with 1511 cubes  a 500 bot will have say 100 cubes in chassis 100 in plates and 200 cubes in weapons and 100 in armor  a 1511 bot will have like 150 cubes in chassis, 600 in plates, 300 in weapons, and 461 in armor  so you'd end up scaling the weapon damage x3 but fighting bots that can take about 5 times the damage  it's really gonna need some dialing in, it's not going to be as simple as just making it 3x"
Robocraft,3dct8r,NotHomo,2,Wed Jul 15 13:51:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah. With the system he is outlining,all that would happen is that a bot with T1 SMGs would be able to kill a T10 bot with enough time."
Robocraft,3dct8r,Phlegm_Farmer,6,Wed Jul 15 15:26:52 2015 UTC,"I don't really know how I feel about this, for one thing making T1 weapons something like only 1/3 the power of T10 means that you have to go up about 3 tiers between weapons before any noticeable difference in damage. Which wouldn't be worth the CPU. And honestly I much prefer the current colour=armour. But if they added a set of cubes at each tier that could be dyed by clicking on it with a different cube. In fact, I wouldn't mind if it were slightly more expensive than the on tier cube. Emphasis on the SLIGHTLY. I'm looking at you C6, Mr. ""You could buy a TX-1 cube and a half for the same price"" This would mean that prodominantly, players at a ""tier"" would have similar colours and you could see that, but that would still allow Batmobiles and such provided you have that colour unlocked. Don't get me wrong, I would love to be able to use Blue instead of Purple on my T10 Death Stinger. But I feel like now changes are being put forward to amplify creativity are hindering the combat aspect.    This pendulum of ""Build Drive Fight"" keeps swinging to the extremes.

Now you might think that the yes opinion is strongly supported, but remembers artbotters are typically much more vocal than normal players, the majority of the game population who just want to shut up and play the game and not pranking around. Remember, if this game is made for voxel art, there are many more games for that purpose outthere. What is missing is a combat game with true endless customization, and that is the selling point of Robocraft. I would definitely quit the game is this goes through.

Also, it will help adding new building option like 2CPU armored block in the future; kinda like T1 player can put some heavy chassis cube or some light one, it will be possible to do this at every tier without loosing any health point.  To resume, if freejam handle this well, this change can only be good, allowing for people that like artbot to build one that would be as viable as any bot if they do it well; But it also help people that doesn't care about artbot, because they will have access to all variety of cube (from T1 light/heavy cube to TX1 cube) without tier as a restriction.

Robocraft,3dct8r,MIR_TEIWAZ,6,Wed Jul 15 15:08:08 2015 UTC,"This sounds kind of dangerous and a balace nightmare.   For starters T10 guns have much more damage/health than just 10 times T1. Currently the damage model is T2 is twice as T1 and T3 is twice as T2. If I am correct on my math T10 guns do around 40 times the damage of a T1 and has about 60 times the health. Now T10 armour does have 10 times the amount of T1. Already we have a couple different percentages and balancing them all sound fairly challenging. It also adds the questions of EP and their armour values in conjunction with their RR and CPU costs.   Before we blindly accept this we have to think. The only way this will work is if they made these changes and there is no difference in the speed bots are destroyed. If they aren't able to pull that off than some bots will get broken, which I find unacceptable solely for artbots. I think it would be fairly impossible to pull off without major testing.   Overall I think in practice it would be a complete mess for something that can be fixed in easier solutions. I like the occasional artbot but to change the entire damage model and re-balance for everything for bots that will be semi-efficient and probably never be competitive is a little much. To be perfectly honest most artbots are just cosmetic, even with on-tier armour they are very inefficient.   A much simpler approach is just let us paint our bots. Give us a paint gun with a little GUI and a drop down menu to change color. It's no different than selecting a different block and will allow us full artbot ability without drastically changing the game."

Robocraft,3dct8r,Djens58,4,Wed Jul 15 13:12:33 2015 UTC,First I want to say that I give zero fucks about artbots and those who feel they should be equal to functional bots.  Having said that I get why people want color options and I don't object to that.  But this system seems complex and not nearly worth the trouble. Why not just let people change the color of their blocks? The end result is exactly the same.
Robocraft,3dct8r,luv2pb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:18:29 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of just allowing players to selectively re-color their bots as they wish. They could jokingly make it all white to troll (I guess), all black (slimming) or ""planetary camouflaged"" (most efficient)."

Robocraft,3dct8r,TheArtBotGuyZD1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:17:25 2015 UTC,removing tiers will bring back old players. This: This is a game rebalance for the sake of creativity. I want to see how it plays out.
Robocraft,3dct8r,IHaveAGloriousBeard,2,Thu Jul 16 07:59:31 2015 UTC,If this happens I am building a McLaren F1 in tier 1.
Robocraft,3dct8r,Onceuponaban,2,Wed Jul 15 09:07:02 2015 UTC,"While I'm all about functional artbots being in the game, this type of change sounds like it would be an absolute horror show with balancing. Currently, many bot designs in the game rely heavily on the unique behaviors and exact armor values of the cubes they use on their bot. I have an alternative suggestion that I'm sure you've already thought of: Why not just have every tier cube available in all colors? Of course, not all colors would be available at the beginning, since people would want to be able to show their level of experience...so, when a player reaches a new tier, with a new color, it unlocks said color for that tier armor, and all future and previous tiers. In other words, a player who has reached tier 6, would be able to now put blue T1 cubes on a T1 robot, (if they decided to build one) but a tier 5 player could not. As far as unique colors for unique tiers...sure, you should be able to keep that feature no problem. Or, just make special event cubes much more expensive when used outside the tier they were introduced in.  Of course, the obvious problem with this idea is the addition of so many cubes into the inventory/cube depot. It would get to the point where finding the specific cube you're looking for would just be a massive pain. So, what would need to be done is some sort of UI overhaul. Trust me, I know these aren't fun, but it would need to happen at some point or another anyway. The current player inventory/cube shop UI is a bit of a pain to use, and it really could use some new functionality, perhaps more buttons for separate tiers, a search bar, or minimize windows? I don't know, that bit is up to your guys' best judgement. But I do think trying to perform an entire armor value balance overhaul deal would be a bad idea.  Just my two cents. Take 'em or leave 'em. I'm just trying to be a helpful mind."
Robocraft,3dct8r,TheAero1221,2,Wed Jul 15 22:49:47 2015 UTC,so... every bot will be white...
Robocraft,3dct8r,starwars1139,2,Wed Jul 15 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"Of all the ideas that people have shared, it seems the least controversial method to give as many folks what they want is this:  __1) don't change the current mechanics of the existing blocks, they are fine as is  __2) let people ""spray paint"" their robot's blocks with whatever color they have access to  __3) in the future, robot components will be unlocked by a player's level, so allow ""spray paint"" colors to be unlocked by level  For example: level 1 player can only buy white or grey blocks (with their current values), and can paint their bot's component blocks white or grey. A level 100 player has access to ALL (non-premium) blocks, and can color all of those blocks ANY of their (non-premium) colors.  FJ can monetize access to weirder colors (and textures), and artbot designers have far more latitude to create."
Robocraft,3dct8r,gairlok,2,Thu Jul 16 02:09:11 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping they do go through with this.  It's going to feel like such a different game, with no tiers, and color having nothing to do with armor.   T10 guns will be 3x t1 rather than 10x.    I'm excited for all this change.

Robocraft,3dct8r,boybrushedplad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:07:34 2015 UTC,I don't see how he can balance things if all armor is the same.  Basically in the end to balance it there would only be one tier.  There  would be no progression. just build and fight.   As long as there is progression seems to me there needs to be different healths of armor blocks..as long as everything else has them also.  Either let us paint or tie the armor value to something..like the guns.  but then that messes up the price of blocks.  It seems madness..but I will try it if they do it.    I would think art is a lower percentage of users..but maybe he wants to increase that.  In the end this is a PVP game as it stands.  Death and destruction is the main goal....not pretty bots.
Robocraft,3dct8r,DumberMonkey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"That's where I'd have to disagree: creativity is the primary goal of Robocraft, as that's the niche it's trying to fill.

Robocraft,3dct8r,IHaveAGloriousBeard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:05:11 2015 UTC,Well I am not one that will quit just because they revamp everything.

Robocraft,3dct8r,DumberMonkey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:11:43 2015 UTC,"What about hub and pit then? Hub as place for art bots was reasonable. I don't want to have party full of artbots that can't do anything other than just looking funny in battle especially before clan update when I can make competetive party. His ""let's make game competetive"" had some sense, now he's changing it and he wants to put artbots into upper tiers. This is bad idea. When I want to fight, I go to battle mode and fight for serious. When I want to show my bot, I go to hub and talk with others. At least in theory and that's how it should work and is best for game.  Also following his logic -> why breaking whole current balance and making it from start instead of making colored tiered blocks just for cosmetics? This is beyond my imagination.  It is now possible to connect good looks with combat properties at T10. I have two such bots, they please the eye and wreak others."
Robocraft,3dct8r,Mtax,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:04:40 2015 UTC,I like the idea of being able to have freedom for art bots and being able to have our own colors on our bots.  But not really sure about the changes to armor and weapons
Robocraft,3dct8r,thalius69,-7,Thu Jul 16 08:58:30 2015 UTC,"If you think that Robocraft has one of the best gaming communities, you are dumber than I thought possible.  You have always had a crap community, because you keep it that way.  By not having perma ignore function.  By not fixing the chat issues, like ppl never receiving msgs from friends if said friend enters a match.  By having a tiny chat box.  By having endless platooning issues.  And finally, By turning the game into a 'shoot towers and respawn' game that draws in 'I don't know how to lose with dignity, or how to use teamwork' players.  People often never know they have PMs or toon invites until it's too late  Even the meaningful statements/questions made in chat hardly ever get a response, because your chat box is so small and full of spam, that a msg only stays there 3 secs, and goes largely unnoticed.  But you do this all to yourself. You are not a mature dev team, you 1) relapse on decisions(like art bots, classic, towers, tiers, OC, etc) thereby showing that you do NOT stick to your guns. And you 2) try to appease the whiners and children with their endless retarded and self defeating requests(which is prob why #1 is such an issue)  I am so glad I hardly play this game anymore.

There are tons of other robot archetypes that are super good at the moment: plasma bombers, thusterfucks, railgun walker/flyers, copter SMGs, Medic tesla sleds... People only complain about SMG gunbeds because gunbeds are good at 1v1 on the ground up close, which is probably the most accessible kind of strategy to players since it's relatively straightforward.. Personally, I believe it's fair for a gunbed to win 1v1 in that situation since that's what they're supposed to be good at. A lot of players are blind to the other strategies the game has to offer which a quite formidable.   A real issue that I see with your suggestion is how complicated it seems. I think it would be better to just have a simpler more direct solution such as increasing the speed of hovers, or equal matchmaking of medics on each team, or decreasing the speed of tank treads, or increasing the viability of wheels."

""  I have been playing since the game came out(in beta), I probably know more about the game then you. I am not just talking about smg gunbeds. EVERY SINGLE competitive bot is a spam of guns (AKA gunbed) whether it be a flying,walker,copter,wheels smg/bomber or ground smg/bomber/rail. All of them revolve around a bed of guns,   As said whether or not you agree with me the fact is that 99.99% of competitive bots are gunbeds. To disagree or thumb me down is just a denial of the truth. It's impossible to have a viable bot with only one or two guns. So buffs should be made accordingly."

For two, apparently you still don't have a great understanding of the game even after all of your experience.   Let's play out your suggestion. Now, all bots have 6 guns and a variance of armor/electroplates/whatever and everything is now tankier due to increased block resistance and more allocation of CPU to armor. How is that any better than what Robocraft currently is? I guess now players would have even bigger blockspam tanks, and it would take ages for everyone to die? Your suggestion doesn't increase the diversity, it just changes all the gunspam to armorspam and makes everyone take longer to kill.   If what you want is longer battles, then a simpler solution would be to just buff armor/EPs or debuff weapons -- but I don't think that's what you want. I think what you want is diversity, and I don't think your suggestion will create any more diversity than there already is."

A person's opinon, coming from the person who thinks gunbeds aren't meta.  ""I guess now players would have even bigger blockspam tanks, ""  Bigger means being a bigger target, being slower and less maneuverable.  In terms of capturing objectives an entire team of slow moving bots wouldn't stand a chance against a few fast ones. They would also be much larger and easier targets for flying bombers ETC,  Therefore in order to win there needs to be diversity, A few tanks to soak and distract. Gunbeds for fast and agile damage. And hybrids as a bit of both. This would be the natural outcome of such improvements.  "" and it would take ages for everyone to die?"" No, at this point in time in the game even an extremely heavily armored bot (maxed efficiency) can be 1-2 shotted from your typical gunbed. There is obviously something wrong and buffs need to go around in terms of armor and using less guns.  ""it just changes all the gunspam to armorspam and makes everyone take longer to kill.""  Wrong. Let me explain in a way a less intelligent person such as yourself can understand.  Robocraft is a game that promotes creativity, ingenuity , thinking outside the box. Building something cool, but the way the game is shaped it eliminates all that.   Gunbeds have set the stage for nerfs and buffs. All of the weapons have been buffed and nerfed based with accordance to the fact that players will put 6 of them on one bot. Now to put this in a nutshell for you to understand, If any player wants to build a bot using one,two or even three guns are already at a severe DPS disadvantage. If you have any experience with Robocraft you know it's simply a lost cause to put so few guns on a robot. This eliminates the creative and strategic aspect/depth of the game to merely one avenue. A gunbed.   There needs to be buffs to using less weapons, maybe for example one rail does more damage but reloads and fires slower. For bombs having one increases the blast radius and damage.  Or like I said before. The more guns you have the less health they have. There needs to be a plus and a minus to everything. With extra damage comes less health. With extra health comes slower speeds. With slower speeds means taking more damage (easier to hit).  Gunbeds right now have the damage,  health(Shields&Compact armor), and the mobility. No style of bot can compete.  Your saying it won't increase diversity, but really those words really mean nothing. You aren't looking how it applies. Just a disagreeing defense mechanism."

This in turn makes the meta about gunbeds with shields. Low creativity and low fun. Just repetitive and boring.   The worst thing is the only counter to a gunbed is another gunbed. Rails are almost useless with the sheer amount of guns on the enemy. . Your only counter is to build more and more.

So basically everything you said, you are leading with this idea, the foundation of your suggestions and arguments, and I disagree with it.  You asked me, like what?  As stated by a poster before me, there are many platstyles that work besides gunbeds, even against gunbeds.  Plasma bombers offer many different play styles.  There are multiple ways to play medic.   Tesla bots can work wonders with the right platoon.  Smg copters can even take on gunbeds 1v1 many times.   Rail walkers have the advantage of maneuverability.  Thrustersticks in groups can wreak havoc.    As I stated before, gunbeds are good at close range 1v1.  Many different bots can take out gunbeds, but it's up to how you fight them as to how well you will do.   Use cover.  Use maneuverability to take them on as groups.   Take down towers and force them to try and clean up behind you.   I often find with my own gunbeds that I'm too slow to keep up with the players in the air as they go from tower to tower to my reactor."

The result: A walker that can actually stop on slopes and doesn't have a gigantic hitbox, combined with all the toughness of a tank. Treads have infinite torque if they have grip, and walker legs have infinite grip. It just works too well.  (also, that single small leg is enough to make your 200,000+ kg tank jump)"

Perhaps a 60% CPU efficiency instead of 66.67%?  There should be a cost to being able to divert damage to certain hardpoints and regen some protection (via shield).

Robocraft,3d9dao,Khoakuma,5,Tue Jul 14 15:17:53 2015 UTC,I just want to say firstly: You guys made a fantastic original game that is tonnes of fun to play. I think one of the reasons there is so much negative feedback from (at least the reddit) community is because people love the game like me and are just afraid for it's future. You guys have plenty of people happy with the game and who think you are awesome just wanted to say that!  My question is regarding medics: Why are they mid/high tier only?  I understand the concept of introducing the different aspects of the game gradually to newer players but it seems since you added plasmas to T1 this isn't as high a priority as before. I would love to play a few games in T3 or T4 with a few medics around or in T5 with a medic with more than one nano available.

Robocraft,3d9dao,Baerentoeter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:03:39 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, I love your game but have a few concerns:   Ground movement: Nobody likes hovers anymore, the tiny bit of speed you gain with wheels isn't worth it, and tracks don't handle well at high OC. My main concern is with tracks. When I only use two (like a normal tank) my bot is almost uncontrollable at high OC when try to stop, start, or turn in place. Could you modify their movement so that it is less instant torque? Doing a 360 spin jump on flat terrain was only cool the first few times. lol I haven't had much luck with other track configurations, 4 in a horizontal line results in excessive over-steer, and 2+2 under-steers and is impossible to fully armor  How is that ELO system coming along? Matchmaking ruins this game for me. It's exceedingly rare to have a close match with balanced teams. This one is more of a complaint, but can you please give us a way to see the speed and altitude of our bot without spending RP? It's a little ridiculous that as a paying Premium user I can't fully optimize my bot unless I shell out another 5$ for GC to buy that stupid speedometer.   Edit: Also, What are the chances of us getting T10 skis?"
Robocraft,3d9dao,unicornslayerb,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:13:51 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a new way damage is dealt to functional parts:  All gun's health is increased by 30%, but when a gun takes enough damage (33% or so health left), the gun will no longer turn. It can still fire, but no tracking.  Movement blocks, they have 30% or so more health, but take damage a bit like the guns. For example: When a steering wheel takes 70% or so damage (it has 30% health left), it loses all turning capabilities. It still spins and puts power onto the ground, but no steering (it essentially acts like a normal wheel). At 80% damage (20% health left), the wheel's motor stops entirely, making it unpowered. At 90% or so damage (10% health), the wheel will be broken up, causing a really bumpy ride. The same can be applied to all the other movement types. Another cool thing to see would be graphical effects like smoke. Like, if one of the thruster's got damaged, it would start billowing smoke, letting you know you've lost thruster's. And my final question: Will we see Megabot wings? These could be really massive, and have electroplates built in, and when they take damage, instead of all breaking cleanly off, parts of the wing would break/fail. Hopefully you'll answer/address this question in your stream, and thank you, from us Aussies!"

Maybe new bot types? Like: boats (idk just an idea), propellers (for slower aircraft), beefier wheels (off-roading anyone?), longer skis, the return of low tier planes (:P), and maybe an entirely new bot type; space ship :D (provide longer range support and a all space craft dogfight high above the planet's surface. idk sounds fun to me).  and how about some new flight mechanics? allow us to have more control over our aircraft (like only using certain parts for certain functions) so that we can fly more realistically. Real planes don't use the rudders at the rear to turn. wings aren't used to gain/lose altitude. real planes can use the vertical rudder at the rear to make horizontal turns without needing to use complex maneuver (ie, tilting to the side, pulling up).

I'm finding myself extremely reluctant to touch Battle Mode at the moment though because the steam roll effect is just too strong, and the three tower system means that strategy has pretty much been dumped as nearly all of the action happens either at the towers or bases rather than having skirmishes all over the maps.

Robocraft,3d9dao,GOForce3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:48:57 2015 UTC,Why is there a gun firing cap? Why not just balance gun cpu price so people can't abuse multiple guns? With a gun firing cap it removes diversity from the game. There could be much more unique builds without it. Also it sets a standard amount of guns for each robot. If you only need max dps you only need 6 guns no more. Having 6 guns on everything but SMG's is boring.  All in all there could just be so much more builds that could happen without a firing cap. It's not impossible to balance guns so it could happen.

Robocraft,3dc7vf,Onceuponaban,3,Wed Jul 15 05:31:35 2015 UTC,"A lot of things happened to plasma since the last year. It's been nerfed to oblivion then brought back up to competitive level, several times.  Crash course on the latest major update, the Respawned and Overclocked update : the new battle mode (the old one being now called ""Team deathmatch mode"") contains respawning and is about taking the protonium towers on the map to de-activate the enemy shield and destroy their protonium reactor to win. The shield, when active, allows you to heal at base automatically, and it blocks shots from the outside. Bots can pass through, however.  The new battle mode also includes overclocking, which improves several aspects of your bot as you kill enemies or destroy protonium crystals (e.g speed, damage...). There are 13 levels of overclocking (with the team deathmatch mode being locked at level 4). The armor blocks however do not improve with overclocking.  Right now, plasma cannons are somewhat weak when at low overclocking levels but become very strong at high overclocking levels.  Among what has happened since you left was, in chronological order :   New map called Tharsis Rift Spotting mechanism (press Q on an enemy bot to make it visible on the minimap for the whole team for a few seconds) colored name tags with the tier : blue between 6 and 9, orange for 10 and TX-1 (more on this below) Rise of the walkers update : Walker legs (new movement type, you can walk and jump with those) Nano disruptors, basically a healing gun. It damages enemies, heal allies, and has a limited range. Tanks are rolling out update : Tank tracks. Those allow you to turn in place, they're big, and have a lot of armor. New cosmetic blocks : Altimeter and speedometer. Galaxy cash only. Dawn of the megabots update : New tier after tier 10. Those bots are enormous, and pack big weapons. Nowadays, you can only encounter them in team deathmatch mode. Also includes rotor blades allowing you to build helicopters, a mirror line and a better alignment rectifier (bound to F) TX-1 mega plasma launcher TX-1 hoverblade Respawned and Overclocked update Electromania update (includes all electroplate shapes at tier 10, along with new carbon 6 blocks for tier 10 that are orange and black) Robocurves update, with new round blocks Aero rods update (new long rods that are much lighter than blocks, can span 3 or 5 blocks + a L shaped 3 blocks version) Team orders update, allows you to place markers for your team on the map.   And a truckload of balance changes along the way. This list probably isn't complete."

Robocraft,3d7ls9,Raycu,7,Tue Jul 14 23:04:31 2015 UTC,"I know you guys really like this concept but we have to be reasonable here. This looks extremely complicated to code and the devs haven't even got started on it yet. Not to mention obvious issue of heavily taxing the servers (remember we are still using mostly hit scan hardware for a reason). If it ever going to be implemented, it has to be at least another year.  The only other voxel game that has this feature is machinecraft, and even then that game is extremely clunky to play. I would much rather see the devs put an assortment of new features like bipedal walker legs, rocket launchers, mass and cube composition display for building etc. than waste too much time developing this. i know that i am known for some pretty outlandish concepts too, but those i can sort of visualize the implementation of using mostly available mechanics (like crank up pseudocodes for it). This thing... I just look at it and my head hurts. of course i would love to be proven wrong. I think this thing is awesome and a big game changer."
Robocraft,3d7ls9,Khoakuma,4,Tue Jul 14 09:33:06 2015 UTC,"Every time this gets posted I feel like I have to tell someone that it's more complicated than they think it is. It requires a max volume solver for bone boundaries, boolean volume solver for bone constraints, and real-time IK for skeletal resolution."
Robocraft,3d7ls9,JViz,5,Tue Jul 14 10:00:05 2015 UTC,"It's a really interesting problem. But you can get around an IK solver if you limit the number of chained rotors to 2. With two you can immediately solve for pitch / yaw and not need to do any of the crazy pseudo inverse stuff involved or CCD. Even with this limit it shouldn't effect the player much. You'll notice all of the designs in the video only hit two rotators. (There's one with 3 rotators but two are on the same axis and thus don't really count).   Before anyone screams bloody murder about this limit, it's 2 chained rotors you should still be able to have many chains of two. Additionally with 3 chained rotors you lose an intuitive way to control it.  This 2 chain limitation would also make it easier to solve for constraint angles and limit the computational cost with it. Fewer axes, fewer problems. Though it doesn't help with solving multiple chains of rotors. If you put two rotors too close that they can smack into each other you're SOL.  Then comes the physics the game has lots of stuff that applys force to your bot. Joints are constraints and constraints don't like force. They break and bobble like the bad ragdolls from Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. They'll almost certainly need a multi-body solver like Featherstone.  The best approach for joint constraints might be just solving each rotator chain's constraints for not hitting the base body piece, and then letting featherstone / collision handle interactions with body pieces that are on rotators.   Though if you have all rotators following the same solution angles. Such as all pointing their platform towards the mouse ray. There might be something you can exploit to help. Either way I still think you'll run into tangling situations."

Robocraft,3d7ls9,Khoakuma,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"Would you be pointing the end effector(gun) at the target? If so, we're still talking about IK. IK is always cheaper with less bones."
Robocraft,3d7ls9,JViz,2,Tue Jul 14 20:45:21 2015 UTC,"Well the video/post doesn't seem to care where the gun is.  Simply point the platform towards the cursor. In my suggestion, this would be invalid since it's a 3 chain.  Since RoboCraft is third person the aim ray isn't directly the mouse ray. It's formed between what you're aiming and what the mouse ray hits.  So for any given joint you define the AimRay as AimRay = MouseHit - Rotor.Center  You simply take the plane perpendicular to the rotor axis, project the aimray onto it, call this ProjAimRay. You then want to transform ProjAimRay into the local coordinates of Rotor to get LocalAimRay, then you set the target angle for the rotor to move to as Rotor.Target = atan2(LocalAimRay.y, LocalAimRay.x). (x and y might depend on how you define your local coordinate systems)  As long as there's not more than 2 joints in the chain you're fine. Of course if someone places redundant joints you'll have to combine these to one entity. Math might be slightly off here. I did something similar for a robot simulation several years ago. I definitely didn't roll my own IK solution and it worked perfectly. Actually once I got the real IK implementation from the company we were working with it was indistinguishable."

Robocraft,3d9oks,Khoakuma,2,Tue Jul 14 19:46:54 2015 UTC,"umm uhh... idk... this... is a weird dilemma...  typically if you wiped the enemy team at the beginning and gain massive OCL advantage, the damage output differential becomes massive and you would just proceed to take every remaining tower and spawn camp until the enemy all quit...  unless you want to spawn camp right away, without taking towers, dicking around the enemy base at 2 minutes, and then get punished, then sorry, that's the exact pattern Freejam designed the Battle mode to prevent.  Take tower first, then continue to roll over them, pretty simple. imagine playing League and ace the enemy team from an early invade then proceed to do nothing but sit in the enemy base attempting to spawn camp and not use the massive advantage to do everything else and take resource off the map, CS, towers, dragons etc. . See, things don't work that way."
Robocraft,3d9oks,Khoakuma,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:27:00 2015 UTC,Thing is that one of the towers is close to them. So when medics are in game they will nut hug when they respawn and kill anyone taking that tower. No matter how much OC they have. Then your respawn is longer than theirs. So they can roll the map.  OC advantage is not absolute.

Robocraft,3d5goe,Blue_Crusader,3,Tue Jul 14 02:22:10 2015 UTC,Their rudders are often hidden behind EPs.  Relying on Teslas for Anti-air is hilariously unbalanced.
Robocraft,3d5goe,Never-Wolf,3,Tue Jul 14 02:36:52 2015 UTC,"I think that rails should not be able to one shot EPs. Just too easy to cherry pick any bot from half way across the map. When rail became easy I sold my rails, and I built two rails ever since as a fun experiment. I still don't play them. When I get bored I stop caring about the match and under perform.  Rails used to be my favorite weapon but as it stands battle mode is more fun without them around. That's a bad sign. EP buff would help against that. And honestly if you made an SMG bot to fight at long range then delete your acc. SMGs go hand in hand with tesla in terms of up close and personal. SMG should be about peekaboo tactics and outpositiining your enemy, getting in close and melting them, not playing a heavy ass brick, standing still and shooting at a wall of blocks and medics as drool drips down your chin.  I'll take on a Cluly ball any day. I prefer that one hundred times over a block spam or a rail at jumping distance from his healy shield. And my smg pecks may not take out a shield but the Cluly Ball's plasma won't do shit to me either. You know why? BECAUSE I'LL ACTUALLY HIT THE W, A, S, AND/OR D KEY AND MOVE THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY.  It's called gameplay, not point and click. If I wanted point and click, I'd sell my gaming rig and play flash games."
Robocraft,3d5goe,MrZakalwe,2,Tue Jul 14 03:03:12 2015 UTC,Against long range plasma too many gunbeds just stop moving and try to tap fire. at long ranges plasma takes so long to travel that any movement type can usually avoid it pretty easily. people would just have to not stop or not keep moving in a straight line.
Robocraft,3d5goe,gairlok,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:53:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. Even gun beds can avoid plasma shots or at least make it difficult on a plasma user.   Copters who just sit there are hilarious too. I tesla plus plasma them all the time on my sled. Free kill. When copters are in actuality capable of some great jukes.
Robocraft,3d5goe,ihatehappyendings,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:37:04 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the hit/miss calculation is not made locally to you for enemy shots so you can dodge plasma perfectly on your screen and still lose a lot of your bot.  Dodging plasma should not be depended on as a block tank.

I agree, that kinda sucks, the point of EP was to be weak at beginning and strong at endgame, now it is pretty much the same (sure, still gets better than armor only, but at the cost of 1.5 less CPU efficiency)  Btw, your claim that you can't copy 700+ armor cubes is falsified by for example this"

Robocraft,3d5goe,Blue_Crusader,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:31:04 2015 UTC,"Well cluly's ball is actually terrible against rails. if the wrong shield caught the rail shot it became really unmobile and hard to fly. also multiple shields would come off with a single shot more often than not. if you were unlucky just two railshots kill you. more often two rail shots will unbalance the craft and make flying inpossible. only a couple of the shields could be shot off with minor impact to the craft. additionally if a smg or rail happens to hit the thruster to the side it will become unable to fly forwards properly and will spin out of control. Its strenghts are its mobility, small size and ability to spread smg damage to most of the plates but against rails it cant afford to be hit. Personally a properly built super heavy bomber would be better in terms of survivability and i would currently consider it the best option of those two just because of how weak it is against rails.( sorry for rant, tired of people complaining about clulys balls if they havent tried them themselves. )"
Robocraft,3d5goe,Never-Wolf,2,Tue Jul 14 11:43:06 2015 UTC,Wont happen any more as a shield will now stop a rail of the same level. Aint no T11 rails.
Robocraft,3d5goe,k-byrne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:39:08 2015 UTC,in t10 the difference was something like 5% so a good rail will overclock faster and with just a levels difference they will be able to pierce the plate. also with the recharge being back to 15 sec any smg damage will allow the rail to pierce. i think that's fair enough.
Robocraft,3d5goe,gameinterupted,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:48:10 2015 UTC,I think they need to strike a balance. Currently playing anything other than block spam is almost stupid.

Robocraft,3d5goe,Blue_Crusader,2,Mon Jul 13 20:40:03 2015 UTC,This change would have been completely unnecessary if they had just reduced smg damage at range instead of buffing rail and plasma. This is just another bandaid solution to a balance fuck up.

Robocraft,3d5goe,Never-Wolf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:53:48 2015 UTC,Cube tanks beat EP plates in a head to head currently but are vulnerable to plasma as they are universally large and slow moving.   Airborne plasma eats them alive.  Now if you make EPs strong against everything... such balance.  On the flip side I agree that EPs needed to be better at stopping rails (was kinda meant to be their thing from earlier dev posts) but just making them universally tougher might not be the best way around that (perhaps a grace amount of extra damage they can take in one instance? Make them good at stopping that burst but bad at DPS rather than best at all as they will be or bad at all unless used in some very specific configurations?) but it's gonna go through.  Too many bad decisions in a row lately :(
Robocraft,3d5goe,ihatehappyendings,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"Idk man. This would only make them stronger against rails and long distance mega smg. Plasma and Close range SMG still shreds them, and rails just have to aim around them."
Robocraft,3d5goe,gairlok,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:04 2015 UTC,"No but as it currently stands cube spams will beat an EP 100% of the time. No matter how much you move around.    Only if you are near the cube bot.  If you are far away, EP is better.   I don't want something better, I want something that wont get destroyed by 4 OC 13 SMG shots for the sake of decent movement.    That's 8 OC13 SMG shots from far away. That is within 0.8 second OC13 recharge time. Do you have any idea how hard that is to accomplish?  If you want EPs to be viable on tanks, sure, but buff it in such a way that won't buff the long ranged bots too.  Like for example, decrease damage taken by EPs the closer your bot is.   You also aren't cosidering that someone with half a brain knows to just shoot the surrounding blocks and eat at the interior frame of an EP botusually nocking off the EP anyway.    Not only are there bots that are nearly perfectly surrounded by EPs, but again, long ranged bots are nearly immune to this."
Robocraft,3d5goe,ihatehappyendings,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:00:02 2015 UTC,"Ok. You have a point. They need to strike a balance though. Because you currently can't be fast and in your face about it. Without getting taken out by an onlooking rail or making a single mistake and getting shredded by two guns after having destroyed the other 6 on the block spammer who you otherwise outplayed.  On your point of landing 8 smg shots at max range, it's called burst fire. And it's easier to do at bots far away because they appear to be moving slower the farther they are. As where if someone zips right by me I'll have trouble shooting them, my guns may not even turn fast enough. Should I make a long rang smg montage to prove my point?  Yeah,long range SMG is weak against EP, but rail and plasma isn't. At all."
Robocraft,3d5goe,Vok250,2,Tue Jul 14 02:14:15 2015 UTC,Rails will be weaker in the future as the plan will make EPs be able to tank a rail hit without breaking.

Every time I try the game feels like it doesn't know what it's supposed to be.  It's like they can't decide how they want the game to play so they just keep changing it.

Robocraft,3d5goe,Never-Wolf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"""early access"" doesn't negate feedback. If we can play it, then we can judge it.  Changing around balance and design goals is fine, but recently FJ has been acting like bickering parents that haven't slept in weeks. Every update seems to negate changes made in an earlier update less than 6 months ago. This is the same kind of ADD balancing that Killed BF3's player count around the time of Close Quarters."

Actually, this is just a member of FJ who owns a brain correcting Mark's usual balance fuckups, but still either way, this is a start down the road back to a complete game.

Also, now that larger EP are more balanced, the smaller T10 EPs are going to become ridiculous.

Same goes for mars as sandstorms. Keeps everyone on edge, and theoretically, a stealth bot build will be most effective by the time it happens."
Robocraft,3d49k7,Bluehawk1224,6,Mon Jul 13 12:16:36 2015 UTC,It could be fun to have random weather. Imagine a battle in the Mars crater with the visibility reduced to a few meters because there is a sand storm.  It would give new life to the old maps.
Robocraft,3d49k7,cebeide,6,Mon Jul 13 12:22:05 2015 UTC,"It'd be greater too if the storm would make bombers and copters a bit unstable; not too much that they'll be useless in the air, but enough that they'll prefer to stay near the ground than fly.  Headlamps would clear up a few meters in the direction they're facing; more if there are more lamps placed together.  Yay, we just solved the problem of headlamps being obsolete AND making stealth/small bots more profitable and rewarding!"
Robocraft,3d49k7,Bluehawk1224,2,Mon Jul 13 12:26:41 2015 UTC,"It'd be greater too if the storm would make bombers and copters a bit unstable; not too much that they'll be useless in the air, but enough that they'll prefer to stay near the ground than fly.   Bleggghh. I agree with the headlights idea, but making bombers even worse, why man? Bombers are already easy prey."
Robocraft,3d49k7,22GoixYT,2,Mon Jul 13 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"Not *that* worse; just a little more bobbing for copters and some wind changes for aerofoils. I'm kinda sticking with realistic things here, since a snow/sandstorm flyby won't be a piece of cake.  Alternatively, they could make it so that the storm only extends up to the midpoint, making bombers and copters see clear skies when they reach a very high height. Might be OP for land-based craft though, but they still have the spotting system and radar to compensate."

He could claim he is a good shot. Most assume it when they shoot so far away you can't see them, yet they hit your pilot every time. That I don't know. Except there is a hack for that.  I have never used a hack ever as I don't feel cheating is the right way to play, but I got curious about everyone talking about it and wanted to see if these hacks exist.  If you google it, there are tons of hacks. but that doesn't tell you who uses them or not.  But it does prove they are out there."

I play low tier but I dont consider myself a Seal clubber mainly because all but one of my non-T10 bots are medics. When I play in lower tiers, I do so not to seal club, I actually do it to help teach people about the game. For example when in tier 4 I will explain to people at the beginning that player X is a flyer and that you can tell from the overline. I will deliberately backup and support players that are playing tactfully instead of rushing in and dying. When I play Rail in low tier I will play supportively instead of offensively as most low tier rails play. EG: Shoot the wings, take out the medic... If an ELO system decided that I was too good in low tier, I would be MMed with other ""Seal clubber"" which would completely defeat the purpose."

The problem with ElO based on bot would be that it would have to be reset every time you make a change to your bot.  I think it would be easier to base Elo off the player though, because it is the same player regardless of what bot they're using. This could bring up the issue of high ELO players bringing in terrible bots to high ELO ranked games, but I think it would be offset because they would lose ELO rank and be stuck playing with lower ELO players."

Robocraft,3d3twp,AwesomeArab,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:43:23 2015 UTC,"No its definitely not standard smg fire. If you ever see it you will know instantly.  Normal smg fire will start to be less accurate if you hold down fire, spreading your shots.  The no spread cheat eliminates this, making every shot go exactly where your curser is pointing. Commonly use alongside an aim bot."

Robocraft,3d1m3g,TheF0CTOR,4,Sun Jul 12 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of matchmaking not be based off tiers because you will always have the later end of the tier stomping the beginning of a tier int he current system. However, I think tiers should be present to give people a sense of progression and something to strive for, but not used for matchmaking purposes.  I think (for T10 only since implementing this idea in earlier tiers would complicate things), ELO ranks should be used to identify people based on how good their ELO score is. It would be awesome after you reach tier 10 that you don't feel like theres nothing else to do. You could try to raise your rank to get into the best and most elite group ranking in robocraft.   I feel like this would lead to great things; the top groups of players going at each other that could draw an audience of players who want to become like that, and would not be hindered bethinks like reaction time and internet speed like in CSGO. You would climb your way to the top with good strategy and game sense, or even form competitive teams. I think Ive been watching too much CSGO pro team gameplay, but I feel like robocraft has amazing potential.  Just imagine a game where T10 is no where near the end game. The end game is fighting your way to the highest skill group encouraging people to better themselves not just through getting RP alone, but by employing better team strategy, game sense, and platooning with other skilled players.  There would be a long road of bug fixes and balance changes before this happens, but I see the potential this game has and what it could become now. I haven't played in a few weeks because I was so discouraged from playing this game for several reasons that I will not go into, but something like this being implemented would give me a reason to play, and I think it would be very fun. But since this is a controversial post and a long comment, Im sure it won't be read by the majority of people. I might end up making a post about it later though."
Robocraft,3d1m3g,ElegantBiscuit,3,Mon Jul 13 00:00:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ranking system and classes like you said in general will give the game a huge boost in appeal for veteran players. A ""goal"", if you will, to achieve. Looking forward to it."

Robocraft,3d1m3g,karneychen,3,Mon Jul 13 04:11:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, he needs to focus on known bugs before changing the structure of the game.     I see where you're coming from and you make complete sense when you say that. But, when a game is in alpha, development is geared more towards implementing functionality. What good is bug fixing a program that later is going to introduce something new that makes more bugs. Only bugs that are major or game breaking are looked into any more than ""they exist, we'll add it to the list"". Once the game reaches Beta status, then you will be absolutely right in their focus, since that is what beta status implies. I agree with almost everything else though."
Robocraft,3d1m3g,AwesomeArab,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:00:35 2015 UTC,"I suppose you're right.  It's hard to think of this game as an alpha when it already has micro-transactions, but I'll take (non pay-2-win) micro-transactions over ads any day."

Robocraft,3d1m3g,boybrushedplad,0,Tue Jul 14 10:12:11 2015 UTC,removing tiers is largely cosmetic.  but doing it does bring back overtiering  if you put 4x T6 guns on some wheels you will get teamed against T4 gunbeds and other misc T4 shitbots
Robocraft,3d1m3g,NotHomo,2,Sun Jul 12 20:02:00 2015 UTC,There's no such thing as OT if there are no tiers.  You are just designing your bot as you like and the matchmaker will find you your matches.
Robocraft,3d1m3g,boybrushedplad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:18:16 2015 UTC,wrong.  because the end result is the same as previous overtiering
Robocraft,3d1m3g,NotHomo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:12:14 2015 UTC,"It's not the same.   There is no tier to be over tiered for.  If someone has higher tier guns than you, then you are guaranteed to have better something else than them."
Robocraft,3d1m3g,boybrushedplad,2,Mon Jul 13 07:17:52 2015 UTC,"again, the same thing was present with old overtiering.  if someone put overtiered guns on, you were guaranteed to have more cubes and plates than them  end result is THE SAME"
Robocraft,3d1m3g,NotHomo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:26:35 2015 UTC,"The only difference is that someone with a high rr would be tier x bot will play with low rr would be tier x +1 bot, rather than just other tier x bots of various rr.  Regardless, the devs have commented  that they cannot just revert those changes and completely reintroduce over tiering.  This is a solution of allowing the diversity that overriering allowed while not exactly just reverting the changes."
Robocraft,3d1m3g,boybrushedplad,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:45:27 2015 UTC,but they DO have to revert the changes.  if they aren't returning robot ranking on parts to previous values we'll have TODAY'S system without tiers which means TECHNICALLY there will be auto-tiering.  put a tier-6 gun on your bot and you're no longer matched with anything under 6  they WILL have to change the ranking back to basically what the old values were :P
Robocraft,3d1m3g,AwesomeArab,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:11:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe relative rr values will be similar, but the whole rr system will get a rework to better represent cube ""power level""  or usefulness.   So it's not a revert back to the old way, really."
Robocraft,3d1m3g,NotHomo,0,Mon Jul 13 10:42:22 2015 UTC,"But thats the beauty of balance, no more gunbeds, because they will find themselves against better built and stronger bots. Once the gunbeds disappear, these ""OT"" bots will be pit against similar bots. Besides...     4x T6 guns on some wheels     isn't exactly OP, the bot will have severely sacrificed armour. And that's perfectly fine."

Instead a properly balancing RR system is what is intended, and is the optimal (IMO) solution. Since it should theoretically properly balance fire-power, mobility, armour etc... EDIT: I realise that this sounds like a contradiction right now. What I meant was that it would be fine with that MM system, because it is so dynamic, unlike the current system."

Robocraft,3d1m3g,ihatehappyendings,2,Sun Jul 12 23:39:25 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, there will always be people making different styles of bots in all tiers, the last thing I want is tank V tank. Any bots with similar RR will be pit against each other. Evolving metas dont evolve through stalemate. They evolve through counters. People will notice certain bots dominant at certain RRs and will develop counters for those bots at those RRs. Gunbed V gunbed isnt the natural end result of this evolution, its the beginning of it."
Robocraft,3d1m3g,AwesomeArab,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:57:16 2015 UTC,"In Tier 10, there isn't a Tier 11, so a gunbed with more RR will only be matched with gunbeds"

Robocraft,3d1m3g,AwesomeArab,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:38:32 2015 UTC,"Gunbeds vs MSMG T10s is hilariously lopsided.  Point is, a match needs to have a mix of bots for proper balance.  Backline bots like MSMG T10s shouldn't be matched against Gunbeds for example.  With Gunbeds matching at the upper divisions of t10, what will happen to Rails and Plasma bombers that don't use a lot of parts nor guns?  They will all be in the lower divisions of t10 without any frontline whatsoever."
Robocraft,3d1m3g,ihatehappyendings,0,Mon Jul 13 11:52:00 2015 UTC,Then the MSMGs switch to other bots. The gunbeds will get bored. Are we going to do this indefinitely? You don't seem to understand what a perpetually evolving meta is.

Robocraft,3d1sbx,MorrisCasper,0,Mon Jul 13 00:46:29 2015 UTC,"that's one of the cons of this build though i've said it in my rcgarage descriptions but i had no problem due in fact-->   1.that like you've said bottom of ver is the most exposed thats why when im in dire need of stability to focus fire i do land my ver to make it stable more like stationary turret + closing my bottom part to be exposed. thats what hovers are meant to.. adapt to situations  2.also i got my turn truster behind, the main reason i use that t6 thrusters, makes me more easy to kept facing the direction i want.  3.this bot aren't like TRACK which is i had to kept moving while killing one and other so i WON'T be in the position where i had difficulties to optimize my guns which is also the main reason i put 1 gun on bottom so it lessen the possibilities of the guns hitting each other if i put all 4smgs on the top = you'll lose 1 firepower of your smg, if ure hitting backward (in case u place it lower than other) this way i can shot backward while run or being chased even tho it back are the weakness if i use aerorods it'll require more CPU while the build already fixed i do use 4top mounted on my Reaper+chimera but its because i have EP CPU tradeoffs  4.i know that top smgs are superior in angling but putting msmg that way in a hover will also make your bot more likely unstable (i don't like this kind of hover i can't maneuver in the mountains easily) which is bcs its top heavy. the only reason i dare to put 4MSMG(1 at TOP) on berserk mode bcs i also put 1 in bottom for balancing i already get used to the side smg mechanics so its not a prob i almost always hit my enemies whichever angle they're with both Msmgs (see chimera part in the video how do i optimize the firepower in different angles  lastly that's for aesthetic purpose its ugly to place your msmg in front + top if you're a hover"

Robocraft,3d4l67,TowerCrisis,3,Mon Jul 13 14:31:57 2015 UTC,"Haven't played below T10 in a bit, but I generally aim for weapons, unless a structural weakness is particularly glaring. Sometimes at long range with SMG I aim for copter blades instead.   My experience has been that sneaking up and surprising people is much more important than aiming for anything other than center of mass. I shoot off their guns and by the time they notice me and properly engage, I have 8+1 guns and they only have 4. Teamwork and outnumbering is even more important than that.   Structural points are pretty far down my list of things to care about. a little more importance wouldn't be wrong. A little tradeoff between ammo endurance and structural endurance would be cool. Maybe friendly fusion towers could top you off."

Robocraft,3czzlp,NotHomo,2,Sun Jul 12 09:55:56 2015 UTC,I think Mega vs Mega could be cool as a stand-alone thing. Like if you enter challenge as a Mega you either fight smaller bots or other Megas
Robocraft,3czzlp,VonGod,4,Sun Jul 12 13:12:18 2015 UTC,i think megas need to have their own gameplay   like making megas immune to other megas damage.  so the whole point is the two megas have to kill the opposing teams regular bots and the regulars have to kill the megas.  but the megas themselves aren't fighting each other   or like severely reduce the damage they deal to each other so it's pointless to fight each other until you've stripped the enemy of all his support crew

Robocraft,3czzlp,NotHomo,0,Sun Jul 12 16:13:40 2015 UTC,"But in normal matches, don't both megabots just stand there and kill each other anyways?... And when it's a megabot vs a T10 bot, the megabot will always win as long as it's a good mega."

I thought freejam understood that!  Not even talking about how with megaparts we have now that would be the most boring gamemode."
Robocraft,3czzlp,mitit1001,3,Sun Jul 12 12:24:00 2015 UTC,"Agree 100%, maga v mega is just two smg bots shooting each other from a few hundred meters away until one of them has no more guns. Really boring and seriously repetitive gamplay."
Robocraft,3czzlp,ElegantBiscuit,0,Sun Jul 12 15:08:43 2015 UTC,"Isn't that what classic battles are now?... 2 clusterfucks led by the mega who just stand there shooting each other until one dies?... T10 classic battles could be what they used to be back before the introduction of megabots (coincidentally when the amount of players started dropping) instead of follow the mega or die if you don't.   And why wouldn't there be strategy? 3 Megas could hold their position while the fourth mega goes around to flank, or both Megas could split up and when they see the enemy, attack from both sides to hit Megas from the side or from behind. Another strategy could be having all the Megas rush around behind the enemy mega team and flank them all instead of meeting head to head.   By insinuating that there would be no mega vs mega battle strategies means that you yourself consider mega vs mega battles as 2 groups standing there fighting and did not think of possible strategies you could use."
Robocraft,3czzlp,mitit1001,0,Sun Jul 12 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"The problem with mega V mega gameplay is, that you can't properly maneuver.  Idk about hovers, but at least with wheels, there is no real flanking as far as I could tell."

Robocraft,3d08ek,FlawedBliss,2,Sun Jul 12 12:23:10 2015 UTC,Practice mode probably runs on your local machine and thus uses your local information about your bot aswell. This bug hasn't happened to me since quite a few patched tho.

Maybe try reloging both before and after practice mode after a change, I.E. build a bot, relog and check, then try build a bot, practice, then relog and check. See if there's a difference between the two, maybe one will help better than the other."

In that situation pray no rails or smg bots are looking up and dart behind the nearest mountain.   The ability to fly is a major advantage on some maps, such as the cave map where you can fly off the bridge and heal from the cave wall, allowing your team to hold that choke point easier."

Can't explain the particle on the left and right of the reactor.. they might be bullet holes from a bot that isn't visible, or from the bot that is being healed on the right of the image.

Robocraft,3d0h4x,VonGod,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:36:36 2015 UTC,"Of course it is.. I've made a bug report on it some time ago. Not sure if I also proposed the solution there, but it basically comes down to:  don't rotate the models 180 degrees on the horizontal axis but on the vertical axis.  or mirror on the horizontal axis instead of rotating.  or make a left and right version.  Point is.. it has been this way ever since I've started playing, which was even before the tank tracks were added. Should be so simple to fix that the ""but development time! other more important things!"" arguments really don't hold up."
Robocraft,3d0h4x,PublicEnemy0ne,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:43:29 2015 UTC,I don't think so either. But it's not a big enough issue that it needs huge community movements or anything.
Robocraft,3czfdv,IsilZha,2,Sun Jul 12 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've had a lot of games that end with a twist.   Every moment of the game counts, right down to the last second."
Robocraft,3czfdv,boybrushedplad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:29:28 2015 UTC,"Most of the game was pretty even, but most of my team's bots were poor late game bots.  Decided to try for an upset (note that our reactor was ~60% vs ~95% when the video started) and was able to pull it off.  :)"
Robocraft,3czfdv,boybrushedplad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:32:22 2015 UTC,What do you think makes a poor late game bot?
Robocraft,3czfdv,InfiniteSynapse,3,Sun Jul 12 04:37:08 2015 UTC,"Insufficient defense to survive late game damage levels of any degree and keep fighting.  IE:  A small framed bot may be able to survive 2-3 direct plasma hits and limp away and/or keep fighting.  At OC13 they may be crippled and unable to fight back in 1.  More generally, they fall apart really fast, so if they take shots first, they may have no time to react.  Hard to pin it down precisely other than ""glass bot"" - they may have been able to take a few hits earlier, but they can't with ramped up damage.  In this specific game, it just became readily apparent.  Most of the game was a pretty even fight,  but once the teams were hitting the high OC levels, mine started faltering.  They couldn't hold towers, etc.  I will give them credit for mounting a successful defense while I made that run, stalling for just enough time - they seemed to do okay with the help of our base shield to keep them going.  I'll be uploading the full match later (or most of it, I missed the first ~1 minute) and you can see several on my team had some major design flaws that are the most obvious examples of bots that just get wrecked in late game."
Robocraft,3czfdv,RicArtJammer,2,Sun Jul 12 04:58:29 2015 UTC,This is why attacking connection points are so important. Would have won a little earlier if that other guy was shooting correctly.
Robocraft,3czfdv,DeepMidWicket,3,Sun Jul 12 05:22:18 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of making the connection points clearer to understand, just mulling that idea over :)"
Robocraft,3czfdv,mitit1001,3,Sun Jul 12 08:10:26 2015 UTC,"Dont mull over it, the amount of people who don't know the basics of your game is massive, if I had a guess i'd say 80% of the player base is playing the game wrong, imagine if 80% of the csgo player base didnt know how to plant the bomb, you need to put something in, even hints that pop up wile your waiting to re spawn, like   ""shoot connection points to cap towers faster""  ""holding right click with a medic will auto aim""  ""you can move your bot around in you garage with the arrow keys and .,""   ""don't forget to spot enemy's with Q""  A playable tutorial/training level would be ideal but you need something, it doesn't have to be and probably shouldn't be a slap in the face ""shoot here"" but if it wasn't for this subreddit I would still be playing your game wrong."
Robocraft,3czfdv,RicArtJammer,2,Sun Jul 12 13:34:26 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what we need!  Also, explain the spotting a little more please. I was T10 when I finally figured out how to spot. Before I was jsut hitting Q every time the timer went to 0"

I honestly thought that it was cool before i figured out how to fly it (I thought it was only good enough to backflup). and then i was so happy with myself, The flight comes in handy if you need to chase something, far less of my targets just duck out of sight now."

Robocraft,3czs0t,Shaftronics,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:50:03 2015 UTC,"True, but the ability to be nearly at any part of the map within 20 seconds is worth it."
Robocraft,3czs0t,MorrisCasper,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, My only want is to improve the design so it can change it's flight pattern mid air, It isn't a proper flyer as such, If you take off and wind up sideways you're in trouble unless you can land.

Robocraft,3cy4gu,Taco_Joint_Troll,-5,Sun Jul 12 13:34:54 2015 UTC,You are aware that the image doesn't prove it was him OR prove he was cheating (Regardless of your opinion). So reporting him won't do anything since you can't prove it's him. I mean anyone can have that name if they want. Someone having a similar name doesn't 100% prove it's him.  Get your facts right before you start pointing fingers at others.
Robocraft,3cy4gu,ImAussielicious,4,Sun Jul 12 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"Sorry to burst your bubble, but only moments earlier today, (30mins ish ago) user /u/Highspeedfutzi has posted a video, which highlights ""dylann_roof"" using some kind of auto-fire bot:   https://www.reddit.com/r/Robocraft/comments/3cydrw/is_this_a_hack_im_about_to_report_this_player_but/   Direct link to video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l58G3myXbiA&feature=youtu.be  However, having said that; you are correct. People shouldn't just go out and assume and claim without backed up evidence.

I first had the idea to build a bike, then I built someone on said bike, and it turned out having jesus on a bike was funnier than having mike from Oklahoma on the bike.  Having said that, I'm pretty sure some people could be offended by it, as some would be at people building santa claus or really anything you can ever think of.

You can also see on one of the screenshot that I added a central base between the skis, that's used to stop the roach completely when bombing towers without having to worry about the skis sliding you around."

Biggest problem are the serial connections. A good sniper can destroy the bot with 2 to 4 shots. I will remove some blades and improve the connections to make it sturdier. Maybe add some thrusters for speed.

Robocraft,3cxrvk,Rabiesguineapig,7,Sat Jul 11 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"that game was a prime sample of why kills and damage don't matter without proper rotation. Despite being my team being curbstomped overall (died 10 times that game) we still won thanks to excellent rotatoes, holding 2-1 towers most of the game despite being heavily led on lvls, and the fact is a skilled and fed railgunner is still useless late game no matter how fed he is (Alexampeg had like 15+ kills on his rail cruiser, fricken hell...). If that was a ranked games in the future system all of my team except for me and the railgunner would have been ranked down, despite winning , which is ridiculous and highlight why we need a proper bonuses for things beside destroying. Also, sorry if the electroplated hover was a disappointment (couldn't tank plasma for shit), hopefully you will meet me in the future on my better bots :D."

Robocraft,3cw43r,LittleGitten,12,Sat Jul 11 07:09:02 2015 UTC,I hope Mark makes RR affect how much the part costs to buy. That way no matter what you put on your robot whether a gun or armor it will still raise your RR the same amount. That way there can never actually be rushing to the top tier. Just good ol robots.
Robocraft,3cw43r,J0rdian,2,Sat Jul 11 13:02:00 2015 UTC,And CPU/RR should be the same for all parts of the same tier.
Robocraft,3cw43r,_theRagingMage,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:19:54 2015 UTC,"WHOA! That's such a cool idea! Never thought of this, but yea, that sounds awesome"
Robocraft,3cw43r,mitit1001,8,Sat Jul 11 19:19:45 2015 UTC,This is a great idea because it does free up players from having to confine to a tier.    Platoons are a big issue though.  I agree with what others have said.   There will just have to be some system in place that keeps people from platooning with other people who have bots that would be more than one tier away.   I'm not sure how to emplement a restraint like that without creating some unintuitive like we have now with the tiers.
Robocraft,3cw43r,boybrushedplad,3,Sat Jul 11 13:41:29 2015 UTC,Platoons can be fixed very easily depending on the actual numbers. Platoons can be based on the Robot Ranking of the leader and the other bots must be within a RR spectrum of that bot to join in the first place. This ensures that the team is relatively in the same margin that will be used in the match making.
Robocraft,3cw43r,FugiATX,4,Sat Jul 11 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"Right.   I agree, I don't see any option better than that.   But how do we make that range of rr specific and easily recognizable?   Seems like we'd have to basically reintroduce tiers."
Robocraft,3cw43r,boybrushedplad,3,Sat Jul 11 23:08:42 2015 UTC,"Instead of tiers I assume the RR number will be displayed. It'll be much more important and will be designed to gauge how powerful a bot is so I assume they will make that visible. I wouldn't say it would be like tiers. Tiers are a set number range that bots have to fit into along with CPU and armour limitations. All it really has to say is something like ""Other robots may join with a RR of 1100-900"" when the leader has a RR of 1000. Once that happens then the match-making can find a suitable match.   In the new system the 'tiers' will be based around the bots which is much more different. There also won't be designated number ranges specifically for battles, they will simply be based on the bots themselves (I assume with the info provided) This allows a RR number to be displayed and show a form of progression as well as create battles based on the bots. So you can have battles that were for mid-T9 or just starting around T6, and that could still be accomplished with platoons having similar RR.   The tricky part is how to balance platoons between games. In T10 it will be fairly easily as most will have the same RR but in the lower levels where RR has much more variety it may be difficult to find a another platoon with similar size and bots of RR as well as what they're running."
Robocraft,3cw43r,FugiATX,2,Sat Jul 11 23:27:22 2015 UTC,This is well stated.  Perfect execution.  Let's make it happen now.
Robocraft,3cw43r,boybrushedplad,14,Sun Jul 12 00:43:16 2015 UTC,"Before you down vote, please read the whole comment. I get that +3 or +2 overtiering might have been a little bad for newer players, but overtiering has always been a part of the game and bot building - comprimising armor for more firepower or vise versa. With the current system, it is VERY easy to push through the tiers.   The new suggested idea is a very good one to me. Basically, it's just the same as the old system except no tiers. However, I do believe that the tier of your robot should be shown but not be used solely for matchmaking, but to show progression and give a sense of purpose. (It would also be nice to display ELO score by ranks (like in CSGO) to give the top players something to strive for.)   As for the platoon matchmaking, it's very simple. Treat every single person in the platoon as an individual queuing up, or take the average RR of the platoon and use that. I don't get why things have to be so complicated when the solutions can be simple.    Overall I think these changes are very good and hopefully it'll pump some life back into the discouraged players leaving the game."
Robocraft,3cw43r,ElegantBiscuit,7,Sat Jul 11 07:40:26 2015 UTC,"As for the platoon matchmaking, it's very simple.

Yeah there would be no tiers there, but it would be something like that. Doesn't look very fair to me."
Robocraft,3cw43r,Auxaghon,8,Sat Jul 11 09:50:44 2015 UTC,"By individually, I mean take the RR of every person into the matchmaking consideration to match with similarly ranked players on the opposite team.   By the average of the platoon, I see where that would be problematic, but just make it so that there's a certain amount of RR you can be away from each other (basically categories of RR like the tiers we have now, and you can't be over 1 tier away from another person).   Didn't think about that, thanks."

Robocraft,3cw43r,MrZakalwe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:00:55 2015 UTC,RR needs to grow exponentially. A t2 gun might be twice as good as a t1 gun but a t10 gun is probably more than 11% better than a t9 gun. Or maybe it's vice versa.   The robot ranking of each tiered piece needs to be somewhere between 1.1 and 2 times the previous piece.
Robocraft,3cw43r,Bronze_Johnson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:21:46 2015 UTC,4. Link RP earning amounts to the Robot Ranking of your Robot (the higher the more you earn)   This seems to be easily abused.  I would put as many extra rails or plasmas as possible to get my robot to higher ranking so I earn more RP. Then I just hang back and snipe people with my sucky robot and let others carry us to win.  As end result i get much more RP than I would get by having good well built robot that stays in low rank since  it uses only the necessary number of guns.

(the cubes section will horizontal so users will be able to unlock the color they want from the start). for every type of part there is a similar cost of TP and RP (like 88TP and 100k RP for EP)  matches: everyone starts with 0 robotranking. the score at the end of a battle will add to the rank and the next match will be with players with similar RR.  i think this is how you should do it mark. its the best way to put back creativity and to remove problems like over tiered robots. hope you read it."

Its more about having 2 medics in a platoon that stick together and heal each other. Well they do heal each others tesla..I get that.  But a good SMG  pilot always shoots the blades 1st.

I've been playing tesla medic since before the megabot update and have always had a few in my garages. As long as you see it first, you can almost always stop their charge if you stick with your team. However, from experience, I find that there are tons of players who respawn and run out of their shield on their own, not paying much attention to their surroundings. This is the prey of tesla medics. However, if used very effectively, a tesla medic platoon of 2 can stick with their team and wreak havoc on the enemy team."

Robocraft,3cxrsk,boybrushedplad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:48:46 2015 UTC,I like to have a low profile. Also the aero rods aren´t as good as tx-1 mounts.
Robocraft,3cxrsk,boybrushedplad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:20:20 2015 UTC,A pole is only as strong as each block it's made up of.   A single tx1 block has a health of 1567.  The small aerorod has a health of 1679.  Aerorods are better if you're only putting a gun up on a pole.

Classic mode is still there but with the reduced team sizes you don't have the redundancy of player numbers to compete if your in a disadvantaged team.

First would be Tank Fury (iOS tank death match game), an iOS military version of FarmVille (spent about 2 or 3 years and still maintain a spare account to sell later but sold my main for $110 profit), minecraft, then robocraft starting September 2014.  Started out with the first one about 5 maybe 6 years ago and those were the games I almost exclusivly played. Before that I wasn't into gaming, just watching TV and movies. As you can probably tell, when I get into a game I really stick with it. However I've always stopped playing the games I love for some reason. First one was hackers and glitches and all my in game friends stopped playing, second was it became too pay to win even though I had embedded myself into arguably the 3rd best clan in the game, minecraft got boring after going through sever single player and multiplayer worlds and seeing servers filled with 12 year olds, and you know the reason for robocraft. If you want to know more about it, I love talking about the subject.   After stopping robocraft I went into kind of period where I didn't really know what to do and I spent some time on agario, about 120 on Prison Architect, and about 10 hours each on Besiege and Cities: Skylines.   Steam summer sale came along and bought CSGO and that's really fun. I have maybe 150 hours in the past 2 or so weeks and Im really enjoying it. I was never really good at FPS games but I really like CSGO. I'm only Gold Nova 2 (was GN3 for a few hours but deranked shortly after) but hopefully I'll get a better computer cause I'm playing on lowest graphic settings.

Robocraft,3curlf,Onceuponaban,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:44:14 2015 UTC,"Hello, I'm new to this Reddit. I just happened to stumble upon your post and decided to stop to say that I was brought to the game because of the new update. I don't know what it was like before the update, but the only mode I can stand is battle mode. I like the tactical feel of taking towers. It makes it more akin to a MOBA and less like a FPS which is a good thing in my opinion. I, of course, can't speak for everyone, but at least let this testify that there are those out there who enjoy the new content."
Robocraft,3curlf,ElegantBiscuit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:30:13 2015 UTC,"Yes that is very true that there may be a big player base out there of people who love the new battle mode, but the founding of robocraft, even their slogan (Build. Drive. Fight.), and the player base who grew around the old battle mode and provided the feedback, constructive criticism, time, and money into the game they love is now changed. I for one don't really like the new meta for a number of reasons, but I understand that there are those who love it.   I personally loved the short fast paced gamemode, which is why I picked up CSGO after robocraft. The new meta combined with other factors like a wave of inexperienced players with poorly designed bots playing in the competitive tier of robocraft with little knowledge of proper strategy or gameplay mechanics like shooting protonium or auto healing with nano guns is the reason that my friends and I have stopped playing. Maybe this will be fixed with an ELO a ranking system proposed and scheduled to be implemented, who knows."
Robocraft,3curlf,Onceuponaban,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:40:10 2015 UTC,"The thing about the playerbase is that the one we acquired over months before the RaO patch was here for a third person shooter, not a MOBA.

Also, many of the games I have played recently are either a steamroll of the other team, or my teammates running around like headless chickens getting slaughtered by a coordinated group of enemies, responding and yolo rushing it out there again. Some people don't even bother capturing towers even when there are no enemies around. Maybe Im just salty and picky about the certain way I like to play, but my friends and I have stopped playing.

Also T10 electroplates and the electroplate nerf.  Couldn't they just fix the movement and the electroplates?  I mean is it really that insanely huge of a difference?   The thing is a demand for novelty. People want novelty and if they don't get it, they move on. However, making new shit is risky as it is not gonna work perfectly right off the bat, and people have no patience. It hasn't actually been that long since the recent huge update. It also hasn't been that long since the game was released.   Also the game is in alpha. Most games in Alpha barely have a population at all, so it's not doing as bad as it looks like it's doing. I'd wait and see before declaring this game as headed for the gutter.  (edit: oh, almost forgot about the nerf to seal clubbing and art bots. I forgot about it because it barely affected me at all. I don't make art bots because they aren't as functional, and I don't make OT, or 1k block spam blocks in lower tiers because I'm not a yoloswag Mr. Assert-my-dominance-at-all-costs-even-dignity cunt.

Robocraft,3curlf,Never-Wolf,2,Sat Jul 11 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"the main problems are the removal of creativity and the ease of getting to T10, and the fact that seal clubbing is now even easier thanks to gunbeds (although this was partly addressed). The game is generally in a mess right now, with obsolete mechanics such as tier locked TP and Roboranking, balance issues that are far more complex than the devs realize or want to admit, a new gamemode which simply isn't as fun as the old one that places emphasis on the wrong aspects, millions of long-standing bugs, and a dev team that seems to have the attention span of a four year old.

Robocraft,3curlf,Cluly,2,Sat Jul 11 00:09:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that the game needs a lot of improvement but I have to say, I hate classic mode. It's the same tactic in every single game, group up and charge. I play mostly medic, not Tesla just regular medic, and I hate following megas. That's not fun to me, I may as well be a trailer hitched to the back of the mega because that's all you do as a medic, just follow the big bot, and it's incredibly boring. Don't get me wrong, not every game is like that and there can certainly be some very epic moments in classic but it's just not for me.  That being said I wouldn't want them to get rid of it, I know a lot of people love classic mode, and that's great. I'm not going to spoil the fun other people are having.   Battle mode is far from perfect but I just have so much more fun in it. I like the emphasis on battlefield strategy, I like that there's more to it than just shooting enemies, but most of all I like that grouping up into one group and charging is not the preferred strategy.   With all of that out of the way, I totally agree with you. There's still so much that needs improved in all game modes, and it seems like FJ's priorities are all mixed up. There are very clear problems that the majority of players want fixed but apparently FJ doesn't consider those problems high priority.   I still really like the game though."

Classic is great, or at least used to be but the main fault of it was that dying meant you had basically just wasted an X amount of time reward-wise. Classic offered you the ability to fuck around with designs, and in general. It was awesome. In Battle Mode you're left to min-maxing your build or suffer through what is basically just prolonged anguish.     Alternatively, Defend The Castle. Where one team starts in a fortified position and has to hold, and the Attackers get overclock levels as time progresses and they're not able to push forward. With no winner or loser but simply a time attack objective of ""Lets see how fast you can do this shit."" RC is an open game, Battle Mode locks it down SO fucking bad it's sad and frankly there were a lot of other easier options for new modes IMO.

Robocraft,3curlf,ElegantBiscuit,2,Sat Jul 11 14:56:19 2015 UTC,I see your point. I'm a bit insensitive to the issues lower tiers have as I rapidly grinded my way to T10 and currently pretty much have everything unlocked. I sort of realized early on that T10 is the only place for relatively fair games and that the rest is bull shit. Because T10 players have access to the same things most other T10 players have. Then I got to T10 and there are was a variable I hadn't considered. The damn megabots. If there was a game mode like classic but guaranteed you didn't have to nut hug a megabot and hope that the enemy's megabot is just as tiny as your team's I wouldn't even touch battle mode. And I'd probably only play megabot games as either a mega or a healer.

Don't quote me on this, but I think he managed to fly roughly 25% faster while traveling at a ~30 degree forwards tilt. The downside to doing something like this is that it becomes very difficult to fly strait up and down, because your copter is constantly pitching forward."

Thrust is applied in newton, which affect the craft depending on the weight. On your craft, since there is practically no weight, it would become a battle between the rotor blades and thrusters, , to keep the craft stable while moving, since there is no weight to keep the t10 thrusters back. I would still advise using a rudder for increased angular stability, but definitely not tier 10. Use a t4 or 6."
Robocraft,3cvvwx,_theRagingMage,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:22:47 2015 UTC,"I may try that...I did try T6 in a couple of different configs, but it was harder to control. putting the thrusters inline with the mass has helped tremendously."

Use that as a baseline and slowly add thrust until it behaves poorly."

Robocraft,3ctinf,JViz,2,Fri Jul 10 21:09:30 2015 UTC,"Hi. I have a few of things I'd like to talk to you about.  First, I want to tell you that this my most favorite game ever. I'm in my mid 30's and I've been playing games since I was 3 years old. I wish I could work for you, but I live in the US.  In the lower tiers, progression is more important than fairness. Getting seal clubbed is actually fun, especially when you get to experience a new game mechanic such as plasma. It's like ""Ooooh, I want one of those.""  In general most people seem more concerned with getting the RP and TP to build more and better bots than whether they win or lose. Why not weigh scoring based more on participation, rather kills and/or winning? It's not going to deter people from trying to win.  Elastic stats would fix OT weapons and paper bots. If you make weapons/cubes/movement slightly weaker when they're over tiered and slightly stronger when they're under tiered, it would make advantages and disadvantages less pronounced. People will still want the better equipment, and they'll still want to progress.  Ranked matches without tiers is a good idea, but I don't want my drunken playing effecting my rank and I don't want to always have to play at my best, either. I'd really like to be able to keep random unranked tier based matches.  Thank you!"

Robocraft,3ctinf,Namell,8,Fri Jul 10 18:32:52 2015 UTC,"yes, that is true. But we listened to the community and kept it. We would like to get more new users to play it now - as there aren't enough - so was asking for ideas. We will be making the Classic and Battle buttons the same size so new users are more likely to click it. And were thinking of renaming it so that new users tried it more often like ""Team Deathmatch"" all to get more new users to play it. At the moment 5x as many users play the Battle Mode to Classic so we thought these may help the improve numbers in Classic?"
Robocraft,3ctinf,mitit1001,5,Fri Jul 10 18:37:13 2015 UTC,"We would like to get more new users to play it now - as there aren't enough - so was asking for ideas.   As new player I don't play classic mode since I feel it rather boring.  Few people with hundreds of hours of game time will massacre the newbies like me in couple minutes, I get almost no reward and then I have to wait another 10 minutes in queue for next match.  Classic isn't popular for new players since it is pretty boring game mode unless you are much better than everyone else in match. In regular game I at least have time to play and learn even if I am worse than opponents."
Robocraft,3ctinf,VonGod,3,Fri Jul 10 20:00:55 2015 UTC,Interesting to hear a new players' opinion!
Robocraft,3ctinf,DumberMonkey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:09:52 2015 UTC,Refreshing even. I like to know this stuff.  Battle mode might just be a Newbie's friend.
Robocraft,3ctinf,Reecegreg,2,Fri Jul 10 21:42:48 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of renaming it.  As a new player (May this year) I didn't like classic because I died and got no where. Later I went back to it when I was better and played it quite a bit because you got more RP per hour because the games were so short.  I don't anymore, as I prefer battle mode.  But I do like classic as it is.  Without overclocking my beastly SMG Tank is more beastly!"
Robocraft,3ctinf,MarkDesignJammer,-1,Fri Jul 10 22:16:07 2015 UTC,"We will be making the Classic and Battle buttons the same size so new users are more likely to click it.   So, you think changing the size of a 'button' will increase the players in a gamemode? Cmon, you're better than that.   And were thinking of renaming it so that new users tried it more often like ""Team Deathmatch"" all to get more new users to play it.   But it's more effectively 'survival' rather than 'team deathmatch'.  I've got a suggestion for you, increase the player count back to what it was. I never saw a reason why you reduced it in the first place. One of the main reasons players probably aren't playing Classic at the moment is because it isn't a big game as it used to be due to the reduced player count.  EDIT - https://twitter.com/MarkDJammer/status/619577591146614784  The RP rewards isn't the main problem we have here. So I don't know why you think that is the cause of this flame wars."
Robocraft,3ctinf,Reecegreg,6,Fri Jul 10 18:43:32 2015 UTC,"Well, hardly any new users play the Classic Mode, if you want to keep it alive how do you suggest we promote it. Making the button have equal billing makes a lot of sense right. Also the name ""Classic Mode"" make new users think ""old mode"" so renaming could help. How would you improve it to increase new users adopting the Classic Mode?"
Robocraft,3ctinf,MarkDesignJammer,2,Fri Jul 10 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"Well for starters, changing the size of a button isn't going to make the gamemode popular. A couple of reasons why players won't play classic mode anymore is because you changed the stats of everything to accommodate battle mode instead without considering the impact it did to classic mode.  Also, you could fix up the steam page as suggested by Taco_Joint_Troll on this thread. All you've been showing off is the new meta without a partial bit of advertising for the classic and other gamemodes."
Robocraft,3ctinf,Reecegreg,3,Fri Jul 10 19:08:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, good points about promoting the classic mode as well. Also, the steam page simply promotes the biggest most recent changes to the game. When we release The Pit it will feature that for example. But it's a fair point that promoting helps. I don't understand why you think promotion on steam makes a different but in game it doesn't make a difference? Making the button larger for one mode clearly promotes that mode, so I assume you support making the Classic and Battle mode buttons the same size?"
Robocraft,3ctinf,Lupeie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:15:39 2015 UTC,"Making the button larger for one mode clearly promotes that mode, so I assume you support making the Classic and Battle mode buttons the same size?   Unfortunately you assumed wrong. Not once have I ever said that changing the buttons in the game will increase player count. So why would I support an idea that simply will not work. You're basically attempting to twist what I have said into a positive and that frankly will not work."
Robocraft,3ctinf,mitit1001,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:22:59 2015 UTC,"I personally would make the button's the same size, then it wouldn't show as much ""favor"" to one gamemode. I think naming it Team Deathmatch is a good idea as well since a lot of people are drawn to the gametype. I also agree that removing the text about  more RP on the battle mode.   If you want to drag more people into the mode maybe try something a bit simpler. Something like a new map or two that could test different sizes, some people may prefer a smaller CQC map. Maybe daily challenges that could promote playing both modes.    (I'm not and expert at coding/designing, so I don't know how hard it would be to do this.)  You guys are doing a great job, it just seems like maybe you guys put too much on yourselves and start thinking of idea that are too far out the box."
Robocraft,3ctinf,MarkDesignJammer,2,Fri Jul 10 22:49:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm coming into this discussion a little late, but I think that making the two buttons equal size and removing the ""most RP, TP in Battle mode"" text will really help promote classic to new users.  As long as the ""most RP, TP"" is still on battle mode, any new user trying to Tier up will obviously be clicking the battle mode button, so please remove that text while you are at it.  More players in classic also would be nice, that way maps feel less empty."
Robocraft,3ctinf,Hockey868,4,Fri Jul 10 19:10:44 2015 UTC,i like this idea. I also think the RP could do with a rebalance to make sure it is the same in both modes
Robocraft,3ctinf,VonGod,2,Fri Jul 10 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"The only issue with that which I see is that Classic mode is nearly guaranteed to be much shorter than Battle mode, so perhaps scale rewards, not only with player stats, but time spent in battle?"
Robocraft,3ctinf,DumberMonkey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:12:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, a rebalance is a good idea!  A lot of times people want to platoon and play in Classic, but I'm usually trying to build bots and need the RP so I avoid it unless I want to test out a new bot."
Robocraft,3ctinf,Taco_Joint_Troll,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:44:39 2015 UTC,Actually if I go by RP per hour I get more in Classic.  As long as I am good enough to kill some kills and do some damage.  The attraction of battlemode is you can respawn and try again.  IN classic you only have one chance.
Robocraft,3ctinf,Raycu,0,Fri Jul 10 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"The problem is they ruined the gamemode when they introduced the new meta. Once that got released, many players moved over without an ounce of consideration for the survivability of classic mode. Notice that many of the veterans such as ElegantBiscuit and Flubber20 have left the game because of the new meta killing off the players from classic mode. Notice the drop in peak players as well from whence the new meta kicked in. Just give the game some time to settle in with all the current changes you've already implemented. And then, you can decide what needs changing or not.  You can't simply decide to change many things at once as you'll have to concentrate on them at the same time. Just take each step one by one instead of clusterf**king everything."

It's not that it's us vs FJ, they simply didn't expect us to want classic mode to stay and when they realized it they cancelled their plan to remove classic mode, that's all."

Robocraft,3cu7tg,ThunderLuigi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:30:23 2015 UTC,"When I reach a new tier, I generally have done the following:     Unlock favorite weapon and buy to use immediately. Unlock most-used movement option at the time. Hardest with flight components, for obvious reasons. Unlock second-favorite weapon and buy to use immediately so I don't get bored. Unlock armor cubes and grind hard to get my highest-ranking bot mostly covered in them. With the focus on the RP grind, all other TP goes to whatever looks good. Hang around a tier after getting all the parts unlocked just to get more RP, and then charge into the next with a fist full of it to make the next tier slightly less grinding."

Robocraft,3csees,Masamune00,2,Fri Jul 10 11:44:44 2015 UTC,I really want to try to make an effective Rail build now. I always feel so pressured when trying to play Rail. Never sure what to do. People usually get upset and tell me to play offensively. But then I fall apart.  Maybe I'm just doing something wrong.
Robocraft,3csees,VonGod,6,Fri Jul 10 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"Rail is all about zone control. Most people think that rail is about killing. It's not.   I would rather disable six targets with six shots than kill 2 targets with six shots. You deny them movement, you make them change their mind about advancing. It's psychological warfare. When you take even a single shot from a rail you start hesitating or wasting time looking for where that shot came form.  So if you can spread that fear to six people at a time, your team will steam roll them. I've played games as a rail where I have like 3 kills and about 20 assists. In fact I avoid getting the killing blow on rail cause then they get to look at my bot for weaknesses and they find out where I am.  The secondary thing about rail is avoidance and just being a cheeky bugger. Making ppl try to go for you and slipping away. Taunting them.  If you're in a battle and the rail is utterly pissing you off, but not really killing you then you are up against a good rail pilot."

Robocraft,3csees,BrogarVolant,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:27:07 2015 UTC,I typically go for zone control. I'll find a spot with a good view and nearby terrain and hold it off until my team moves up. Then hopping from cover to cover and pushing control.  I don't rush towers unless it's endgame just because you can more effective take a tower by giving your teammates free reign over a zone.

This huge post to nitpick on a few tiny things like ""the chat can be different languages so why is it listed as only english support?"". What? How does that even matter?? If the game text is not available in other languages than why even bother making a case about it? And during the first moba update the min screen size was 1024x768. Not even sure if you know what ""free to win"" even means... And most of the shots have only 4 players in it because they were recording in studio in preparation for the update. And then there are shots with full teams and lots of players. I just don't get your problem with nitpicking on totally use things."

Pretending I like the current direction would be a lie and sounding positive could very easily send the wrong message to the developer about my reaction to their current direction.  I don't want that to happen, I don't want them to see a line of positive posts and think 'well that change went down great' when in fact it bombed."
Robocraft,3co371,MrZakalwe,2,Fri Jul 10 17:20:55 2015 UTC,There's nothing wrong with responding critically.  But please do it with maturity.  (Just look at the ♧'s)
Robocraft,3co371,Psatch,22,Fri Jul 10 20:24:15 2015 UTC,I like this positive attitude
Robocraft,3co371,Pamela4,5,Thu Jul 9 12:55:33 2015 UTC,"But sometimes people post threads because they are angry but not rational. You see some douches play at high tiers using only one gun,  that's not why people don't like the change so much. They are angry because they can't tear noobs apart by using their T5 guns in T3/T4. Posts like that I don't see anything useful."
Robocraft,3co371,ialwaysforgetmename,17,Thu Jul 9 13:25:36 2015 UTC,"I have seen people claim that it doesn't matter if it's called an alpha because it has been open to the public for a long time and there are in game transactions.   But it doesn't matter. You're average player doesn't care if it's in development or not. Their perception matters because they will leave. And population numbers have been dwindling.  So my worry is if we give them time, the game will end up dying as it already seems to be."
Robocraft,3co371,azrael3000,8,Thu Jul 9 17:58:22 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with your view. As a software developer myself I know what alpha means but I'm sure most people confuse it with beta where only minor changes are expected.  So while I'm personally happy to follow the development and act as guinea pig a lot of people are not and this might in the long run hurt the game. I.e. people might not want to play the game once it reaches beta, because of their experience in alpha."
Robocraft,3co371,Never-Wolf,5,Thu Jul 9 13:10:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with your concern. But I actually think that it's a good thing in the long run. If they survive the alpha, they will come out of the other end with a far more refined game than most online games do.    Take GW2 for example. Great game, great concept, tons of idiosyncrasies because they didn't have an active population to make mistakes on. So while it's a fun game with good mechanics, it's pretty unrewarding. I know I'm comparing apples to oranges here, but the games have something in common. A combat system that is great for PvP. Robocraft is doing well on this front in terms of population. If you want to confirm this, go to GW2and sit in the queue for 5 minutes for a 5v5 match with a convoluted game mode that ANet refuses to update since launch.  My point is that even with FreeJam jerking us around, they've managed to keep a pretty healthy PvP community going.."
Robocraft,3co371,azrael3000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:29:09 2015 UTC,I agree that in the end they will come out with a nice game thanks to all the possibilities they can try out with a large crowd. My only fear is that they won't be able to create enough momentum once the game gets finalized.
Robocraft,3co371,Never-Wolf,5,Fri Jul 10 01:23:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it's a serious concern.   Early Access Alpha as it is right now is a pretty new concept.    It's good to see FJ is looking to hire a PR manager, though."
Robocraft,3co371,MrZakalwe,2,Fri Jul 10 08:28:26 2015 UTC,I think in the long run it'll work out better than all the incomplete games out there that devs refuse to make big changes on.
Robocraft,3co371,azrael3000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:39:25 2015 UTC,It's not really an alpha or a beta when you are charging people money and offering premium time etc. You are at the product delivery stage.  Whatever you choose to right on the page.
Robocraft,3co371,MrZakalwe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:26:18 2015 UTC,"They are charging nobody money. You can pay IF you want. So while I did get some premium time myself, I see this similar to supporting a project on kickstarter."
Robocraft,3co371,azrael3000,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:17:14 2015 UTC,The current model is the standard F2P model. Do you think it will change?
Robocraft,3co371,InfiniteSynapse,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"Of course I agree that it's the standard F2P model and I don't think it will change. My point is just that as RC is in alpha I see the purchase that I make not so much as paying for a finished game but rather as a support for the developer to help them deliver a great final game. Only semantics, but because of this I would still disagree with your initial statement that they are in product delivery."
Robocraft,3co371,lyonsdale,2,Sun Jul 12 22:07:27 2015 UTC,I've had so much fun with this alpha game for as long as I can remember.
Robocraft,3co371,Corsair4,2,Mon Jul 13 06:59:21 2015 UTC,"I agree, if they take too long it will kill the game before they get into a release. BUT think how long minecraft was in alpha and beta and yet STILL broke records once it was officially released. Just the simple task of ""releasing"" a game brings loads of people interested in playing it.  Side note: when that happens, get ready for 2 second queue times in t1-3"
Robocraft,3co371,TheSquigglyFish,2,Fri Jul 10 05:19:22 2015 UTC,"Minecraft is a ridiculous example.  It singlehandedly popularized a genre and a release model,  and is a huge exception. For every minecraft sized success story, there are HUNDREDS of failed games with the same model."
Robocraft,3co371,MrZakalwe,6,Thu Jul 9 18:16:08 2015 UTC,"Well said, this is usually what I tell to everyone I see whining about the tiering changes or the weapon buffs and stuff, that the game is still in alpha and to calm down. It's good to see there are other people who understand this. The game is and will continue to be fun, unless FJ comes out with a ""no fun"" patch. You just have to get used to things changing until they find a sweet spot."
Robocraft,3co371,ZachOps,2,Fri Jul 10 01:55:08 2015 UTC,They stripped the game of the vast majority of it's build options and put nothing back.  I'll come back when they sort it out (and I hope that is soon because this game was really fun a month ago)
Robocraft,3co371,tenaciousleee,0,Thu Jul 9 13:11:57 2015 UTC,Good.   Take a break.   That's fine.
Robocraft,3co371,DumberMonkey,5,Fri Jul 10 17:19:17 2015 UTC,"im with you bro, i know that its still in alpha, which is CRAZY!. but it is going very slow. By the looks of this game still being in alpha, it sure will be an amazing game in the future, unless FJ takes a wrong turn, which i hope they don't."

Robocraft,3co371,Aeolun,3,Thu Jul 9 13:24:09 2015 UTC,I agree.  FJ has a long ways to go before they are done.  It's ALPHA.  Most games in Alpha crash so much they aren't even playable.  Alpha means adding features and game play.  Beta means working out bugs and doing polish.
Robocraft,3co371,im-always-lying,3,Thu Jul 9 15:43:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not quitting the game, I am definitely not posting a rant about things I dislike in the past updates but the truth is that I have been playing less and less, from most days for couple of hours after work to occasionally when I'm bored..."

Robocraft,3co371,NotHomo,5,Thu Jul 9 18:16:26 2015 UTC,"Thankyou very much for your support and feedback, yeah sure we don't always get things right and we can break the balance of the game as we migrate from one core gameplay mechanic to another.  We have always treated Robocraft as a series of experiments, like an organism teaching itself to survive. We have some new features coming that Mark has alluded to over the last week, we are slowly unravelling the unnecessary staged complexity we have put into the game in favour of smarter faster more intuitive solution. Watch out for the next two major releases and see what you think.  Please stick with us and keep giving us your feedback, without that there is no Robocraft."
Robocraft,3co371,TomorrowCries,2,Thu Jul 9 12:42:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it's always great to see the devs so involved with the community.   The way you talk about the game is beautiful.  Early Access (as it is now) seems kind of like a newly discovered terrain in the world of gaming and game development.  A lot of people really struggle to accept that the game is actually in alpha.  Sometimes they might need a few words towards reminding them of that.   Looking forward to the 3x mega update :D"
Robocraft,3co371,camst8,0,Thu Jul 9 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"To be honest with you, all these sudden changes are making many vets abandon the game and lose interest with it. All you are doing is shadowing the low progression you have made with the game with cosmetics and tiny weapon/tier/RR changes. After the Megabot update, the game has slowly sank from the original concept of it.   The game just in my mind lacks the soul that I once had for it before.   Some of you may not agree with what I say but I'm pretty certain on how I feel about the game. All I can say is, I don't know anymore about the future of the game."
Robocraft,3co371,NotHomo,0,Fri Jul 10 00:50:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was a heavy veteran for this game but it's like Reece said. There isn't the same passion for the game than it did many months ago. The fan base for the game has degraded rapidly and it's still deteriorating. I'll probably have about a 10 minute go on it now but other than that, I ain't bothered anymore. The constant removals of everything (inc. Overtiering) and the fact that tiers may be removed completely sounds way too much."
Robocraft,3co371,Enchanter5568,3,Thu Jul 9 23:55:14 2015 UTC,"Robocraft continues to be my favourite PC game for de-stressing and just general fun. Its pick up play style just hits that sweet spot between a fun creative experience and an intense online battle arena, that I rarely see in most games.  But then again maybe I'm just happy that both my plasma bomber and hover medic now work as I always dreamed they would and at T10 no less.  P.S. More maps please Free Jam, and you're doing great!"
Robocraft,3co371,boborossa,3,Fri Jul 10 00:10:12 2015 UTC,I'm so ready for new maps!!!
Robocraft,3co371,lemmingjesus,2,Thu Jul 9 23:09:14 2015 UTC,"I can second that. Even one more would be amazing.   I also have the idea that robocraft maps are not overly complex, so I'm not quite sure why it hasn't happened yet."
Robocraft,3cp0u8,Djens58,22,Thu Jul 9 16:54:02 2015 UTC,Adding it as a permanent thing for premium would also increase it's attractivity without actually giving premium user a large advantage.
Robocraft,3cp0u8,Brainman57,6,Thu Jul 9 17:08:49 2015 UTC,"No, thats too much, 75% sell price sure (maybe), but definitely not 100%. (FYI: I use premium)"
Robocraft,3cp0u8,AwesomeArab,9,Thu Jul 9 17:16:25 2015 UTC,"Why ""definitely not""? I don't really even understand why it's not permanent 100% for everyone, especially with the regular flux things are in."
Robocraft,3cp0u8,BlandSauce,2,Thu Jul 9 19:25:56 2015 UTC,"Because it means that you actually have to grind RP to build something. Want proof? after 940 hours of this game, I sold all my spare parts during the 100% week, I made 60 million RP. Ive seen others reach 200 million. With that much RP sitting in spares, you have no reason to ever grind RP, and thus wont want premium to make the grind shorter. FJ need to make money somehow.    EDIT: Not to mention the downright unfair advantage that premiums would have. IMO such premium memberships should provide boosters to what non paying members get, not stuff that is just better and causes players to think about the game differently."
Robocraft,3cp0u8,AwesomeArab,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:29:26 2015 UTC,"That's a completely shitty reason, but I'm not going to get into that.  Instead, another direction;  We should punish people every time FreeJam makes a mechanics change? It's still in Alpha. Things should change. Things are changing.

I suggest they try by making a good game and monetizing it in ways that doesn't make the rest of the game worse. Cosmetics and prebuilt bots are acceptable in my mind. Also fix their shitty networking code so people will be more willing to give them money.  Grinding is lazy (on the developer's part). Grinding is bullshit. Grinding is a scourge upon all things good about games.  Your edit is new;   Not to mention the downright unfair advantage that premiums would have.   In what circumstance?

It would make people get 1 day premium instead of longer since one day is enough to sell the parts.  I think premium needs work. It is copy of World of Tanks system and it doesn't make that much sense when game actually has end of grind unlike World of Tanks where you grind forever for new tanks.  Maybe give premium users some additional color option and other visual goodies that only work when premium is active.

Robocraft,3cpzpk,Tayette,2,Fri Jul 10 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"As a general rule of thumb, I have a 2 block buffer around the seat connections on all my bots.  If possible, the actual connecting blocks are TX, for that extra health.  This prevents getting railed in 1 shot.  There isn't a lot you can do to survive more than 3 accurate shots.  To get more survivability, hide your seat location in your bot.  Most people put their seats rear-center, so if, as a railgun, I can't immediately tell where it is, that's where I shoot.  Triforcing can help, but can also introduce failure points.  And of course, never ever attach any hardware to the blocks attached to your seat.  Damage transfers from the hardware to the block, and attaching to the seat blocks effectively makes them much larger targets."
Robocraft,3cpzpk,Telewyn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:21:50 2015 UTC,I'd say that the only thing you should attach directly to your seats is thrusters.  Escape pod -> Medic finds and heals you -> Denied kill.

Robocraft,3cpzpk,VonGod,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:00:59 2015 UTC,I recent started moving where my pilot is..because it was always rear center. Its fun to see the rail blow holes where they think the pilot should be.  On my SMG Hover  with 14 guns (800 blocks) and full block top..its not even in the center. I put him off to the side.  but mostly a good tri force box around the pilot is the key. Before I learned about triforcing I died in much fewer shots.
Robocraft,3cpzpk,DumberMonkey,2,Fri Jul 10 05:20:54 2015 UTC,"Basically, some little protection (triforce) around your pilot and never a big thing (electroplate, guns, movement parts except hidden one) near your pilot seat.  The big exception to this is a thruster just next to your pilot seat (like a T4 in front of it), because   1- you can move with it and maybe get to a healer/ go respawn in a safe place/ maybe get back to base?  2- maybe it will save you from being one shotted, you can't survive with only a pilot seat, some blocks and no hardware/movement parts, so a shot that would leave you one block away from death would kill you without the thruster and you would be fine with it!"
Robocraft,3cpzpk,SlypEUW,2,Fri Jul 10 04:28:25 2015 UTC,"I use 2 different methods, both involve the use of prisms for your seat connection that are not connected to each other.  First is to build the bot in 2 completely seperate parts, both parts being fully functional bots on thier own. I use this for smaller bots mostly that cant tank shots by HP alone.  The other method sues a central core of blocks that zigzag thier way towards the outside, to maximise the amount of HP it takes to get tho the seat mainly. Then most of the central section of the bot surrounds the seat withoiut being connected to it. Finally, some sort of damage routing, using the shell of the bot itself to move damage around the bot as desired, or using aero rods to link 2 bulky sections together. With the aero rods, the damage kind of leaps to a different section of the bot before it can do critical damage to a single area.  This is a pretty simple example of a bot built in 2 seperate parts, both functioning well on thier own. http://imgur.com/a/2h4FT  Here is a simple example of using the aero rods to move damage around the bot. It has some routing damage bottom to top, and from back to the front. Its not the best example, but its easy to see as its on the outside of the bot. 2 or 3 direct hit rail shots to the back can be diverted to the bulky front section before the wings and pilot are in much danger. http://imgur.com/a/5Lmeb"

And he sits on opposing prism blocks (so the damage doesn't spread). Well the inner floor is tri forced also.  Not just the 2 blocks.  It takes many shots to kill any of my bots.  Most can survive a full clip of 6 rail shots.  Well the bigger bots where its hard to know where my pilot is, the smaller bots some can be killed in 3 or 4 shots.  I don't see the rail buff as an issue.  Honestly they seemed kind of weak before against properly built bots.

I have a 7 block wide, 8 block long, 5 block deep ""box"" that I put my seat connection in the center of. The innermost ring of blocks is connected to the seat and surrounds it. There are 3 connecting blocks that connect that ring to the next, one directly in front of the seat and 2 a couple blocks behind the seat connection. The next ring is connected to the second in the same manner but with staggered connections. I don't have the rear blocks connected in the back to the seat ring so that the damage gets spread out to the sides of the seat rather than having a chance to go straight to it. The connecting points for the other rings are also buried under a lot of other blocks/treads/guns, so it takes a while to dig to them. It's very VERY rare for my bot to be one shot, and even shots from the rear where the whole block and seat are positioned usually takes at least 3 rails to kill me. I also have a gun mounting tower behind that last row of blocks that mitigates more damage.   If playing in early game I ignore rails unless they're right in front of me since they so rarely kill me and are usually cross map."

Robocraft,3co3cc,Refticus,2,Thu Jul 9 18:20:10 2015 UTC,"I used to play a game called Runescape, absolutely amazing game. I played it for 7 years until finally an update occurred that changed what was left of what I enjoyed of the game. When we have a game that has constant changes we have to understand that those changes may not resonate with our vision of the game. Runescape taught me this lesson well. Change is a blessing and a curse, I find it stupid for one side to remain domination ""Change is good"" hold no more water than ""people just hate change"" Changes are what thrive the game forward and can also set the game back.  Change is required for games to move forward but the change, or lack of, is always the reason games fall apart. It's not a fact of people hating change, it's what the change is. Honestly that's perfectly fine. If people stop playing a game because it changes that is their right for it was completely within their knowledge. This is an early access game after all and the moment we started playing was the moment we accepted the fact this might change completely. There is no shame in leaving and there should be no hate for those who do.   Change is one of those things I will never take a solid stance on besides the fact that I hate it. So while change can be good it has the same chance to be bad. The important thing is that any changes are thought through thoroughly. Sadly that is not always the case. Personally I am wary of change. Freejam only has one chance at a first impression and its important they highly understand the lengths of these changes."

Buffing or nerfing because a certain part is not used enough or too much, respectively, by just looking at the numbers just doesn't fit nor make sense. As it is now, you can't properly balance the game, because you have all kind of players mixed. The good, the bad and the ugly and everything in between. The comment ""There is no seal-clubbing in T10"" for instance is a real indicator, to me, that he has no idea what's going on in the game. There is a lack of perspective required to look at the game from a competitive point of view. Buffs make the good player appear to be even better and nerfs make the bad players appear to be even worse.

They opened up a lot of builds that while often not optimal or power-gamey were a lot of fun.   My favourite bot was a T7 helium hover with 3 T9 Plasmas in a small 4EP shell, difficult to build, tricky to fly but very rewarding when you got it right (crazily manoeuvrable and able to hover perfectly still so could actually use cover). Now it's T9 and can't be used in games.   The new tier system has removed a crazy amount of builds and not given anything new back so I can't see how it is a good change. As far as I can tell zero payoff with a big cost.  I'll come back in a few months and see if Freejam have fixed the mess they've made."

The system where you always build 6-8 guns to any tank is just stupid. Give us more variations of guns of each tier.

Robocraft,3co3cc,MrZakalwe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:42:05 2015 UTC,No it did not.  It gave that ability to top tier people who could use their superior power to noob stomp low tier people. We need more weapon configuration options every tier including top tier. In old system top tier was where people had leaast choices. That was obviously broken.
Robocraft,3co3cc,zwpskr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah we may need you to stop comparing a system that was there and one you dreamed up instead of comparing a system that was there and a system that is now there.  In the old system top tier had the least choices and that has stayed the same they have just given everybody else as few choices. Great job.   T10 was kinda rubbish, T8 was pretty much the peak of the game build wise but now every tier is like T10 was.  All are rubbish.  I also wish they had taken the steps needed to regain build diversity but they didn't."
Robocraft,3co3cc,MrZakalwe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:44:50 2015 UTC,T8 was hell for players without T9/10 parts. And build diversity much bigger is around the corner i think.
Robocraft,3co3cc,zwpskr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:02:56 2015 UTC,Don't remember it being hell. Remember that at T8 you could unlock T9 weapons and lvl +1 weapons were optimal. At each level you could unlock the optimal weapon.  That's basically the same as now.  What gives you the impression greater build diversity is coming? They have worked worked hard to restrict it the last two times they changed the ranking system.
Robocraft,3co3cc,MrZakalwe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"I don´t think that was their intention, diversity is the greatest asset this game has. Doing away with tiers and matchmaking based on robot ranking will be great (i hope)."
Robocraft,3co3cc,boybrushedplad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:28:45 2015 UTC,If it's based on robot ranking that would be pretty close to what we have now.. tiers are determined by robot ranking.  Diversity wouldn't be increased because nothing that doesn't currently work in a given tier could survive in that rr band.   Unless they completely revamp how robot ranking is calculated which would be incredibly difficult to balance.
Robocraft,3co3cc,MrZakalwe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:14:42 2015 UTC,The game is in alpha.
Robocraft,3co3cc,boybrushedplad,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:38:57 2015 UTC,"No it's at the product delivery stage. They are using a business model that says most delivery must be post go-live.  It's nothing like a game in alpha. We've just renamed a released, sold and monetised game to 'alpha'."
Robocraft,3co3cc,MrZakalwe,0,Fri Jul 10 21:20:27 2015 UTC,"no its an early access alpha.  A game that goes public during its early stages of development.   It's a new concept in the gaming world.   It's not for everyone, but it is very popular right now."
Robocraft,3co3cc,El_Gosso,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:02:58 2015 UTC,"That's exactly my point- it's not an alpha as we understand it, games companies have just started releasing games that are unfinished.   The term alpha is used to deflect criticism from an unfinished product that they have released and monetised. They have no requirement to finish the game.  You are paying for what is there now rather than any future finished product which surely would be the case in an alpha?"
Robocraft,3co3cc,IamTarTar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:15:40 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the change - I don't think the seal-clubbing nerf was bad, because higher tier guns are hell for other players on lower tier levels.

Robocraft,3cos9v,TristinX,5,Thu Jul 9 16:19:26 2015 UTC,Only problem with this is if a platoon wants to surrender they can.

I just finished a game we won that I had voted to surrender because we were getting no where. but an opportunity presented itself, we rushed the reactor and won.  but I still rather have more required on no votes, because games where I was wrong are few and far between.

Robocraft,3cnyfi,azrael3000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:56:21 2015 UTC,Yeah it takes a lot of effort to make the new wheels work in lower tiers. I tend to just go with a heavy tier 1 than a fast bot.
Robocraft,3cnyfi,Ezotericy,4,Thu Jul 9 23:57:34 2015 UTC,"Well I'm still reasonably new (started with the new meta, now on t10 since a few weeks). So I suspect that this still counts.  First let me add my opinion to the copied post. I agree that the rules are not posted anywhere, but after a few frustrating games I crawled reddit, wiki, youtube to figure out what I was doing wrong and found the answers I was looking for. When I was low tier there was no CPU limit yet, so that didn't apply for me. There was some seal clubbing but it wasn't too bad. The crystal tower connectors I also figured out via my previous search. I agree though that this mechanic is pretty useless and I'd like to see it removed. Nr. 3 is also newer so it doesn't apply. I can of course fully agree with 4, the chat sucks, without a scrolling capability it's plain useless.  The Edit 1 comment I fully agree, I had a gunbed which brought me from t1 to t10. I experimented a bit, but lack of RP simply made me grind to t10 and now I'm building and exploring. So I would think that a reasonably slow level progression with sufficient RP will make the game more interesting. The first 9 tiers really should not be about how to get past them as quickly as possible. It should be about earning new tech and then experimenting with that. Bugs and exploits were present but not a deal breaker, even though I agree that more work on these areas are required.  Thanks to premium I levelled quickly and now I'm fairly happy at t10, playing mostly classic though. So in the grand scheme of things I would like more RP to be able to build more bots at the expense of slower progress through the tiers."
Robocraft,3cnyfi,Ezotericy,6,Thu Jul 9 13:40:51 2015 UTC,"I started less than a week ago, and besides being blinded by being repaired at base when I'm trying to pick off a flier with my rails, I absolutely love this game. Came from a Kerbal Space Program binge and I can't get enough of it! Saving up for T7 bits right now :D"
Robocraft,3cnyfi,englad,2,Thu Jul 9 17:08:11 2015 UTC,Good :) What's the stuff you enjoy most? Anything you think could be better?
Robocraft,3cnyfi,wizardcourt,2,Thu Jul 9 17:50:44 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't have any serious gripes about the game considering its stage in development. Just simple things like chat and having it be more social. I feel like if two teams went at it with full communication it would be fantastic! After finding rails in T4 I've been hooked ever since, I was previously just sniping with smgs but the rail was all I wanted and more. I love the panic of trying to buy time to reload when I'm being chased by the remnants of my last opponent chasing me with a single smg. I really really like this game _^"
Robocraft,3cnyfi,hanschranz,6,Thu Jul 9 17:56:02 2015 UTC,"The Bad  I just recently started, the worst thing is the idiots spamming the chat, there's LOTS.  Railguns are the bane of my existance, I can never do anything against them unless I manage to sneak behind them  Having to delete the entire robot to rebuild it with slightly better cubes, why can't I just change them? makes NO sense.  Another thing is that people seem really dumb, not going after any towers, just camping the base with railguns because they'd rather not assist the team in winning.  The community is dreadful, like worse than LoL dreadful at least ingame.  Good  The mechanics are fun, I like the freedom of design and some of the designs people make are amazing.  I like the complexity, but getting something that works is a massive struggle for me sometimes, I can't make a flyer that can fly and turn, it's one or the other.."
Robocraft,3cnyfi,IamTarTar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"as for flyers, you need to make sure its balanced, thats the most important thing(unless its a chopper, choppers are very easy to make).  if you're trying to make a flyer, try to first make a plane like in real life, and work from there.  if you're having trouble nose diving or going upwards(or just want to be more agile) put some thrusters turned upwards and downwards on its nose/side to go up/down faster, also be aware that weight affects agility, if its not turning fast, its because its heavy, the farther wings are from the center of the plane, the faster you'll roll as well.  remember that you pilot seat acts as the ""center"" of the flyer, and also affects balance, that doesn't mean you HAVE to put it in the center through, but that into consideration."
Robocraft,3cnyfi,Tetrajak,7,Thu Jul 9 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"I'm (still) quite new to the game even as I reach my 200th hour (probably a lot less since I oftentimes left the game idly while doing something else or alt-tabbing), and my progress to T10 was only boosted by free premiums and the recent update that boosted my level from 72 to 96. Technically speaking, I'm one of those noobs that got to T10 and ""don't know how to play"", as in progressed too fast while somewhat lacking in experience.  One of my biggest question throughout the game, is: what is the point of tiered parts? I mean, all you get is bigger numbers, matched with somewhat equally bigger numbers. The only progression that felt real of the tech tree is when I unlock new parts (e.g. Rails, Rotors, Walker Legs, etc.), but other than that, it feels pretty faux to me.  As for things I really love, it's gotta be the new meta. I personally think it's one of the best updates I've experienced if you don't mention the bugs, cheese tactics, and maps that clearly aren't meant to support the new mode--unfair and too small. While there's still tons of work needed to polish the game mode, I think it's turning into something with potential depth and time sink IMHO."
Robocraft,3cnyfi,With_Hands_And_Paper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"I started playing in September 2014. A friend introduced me, I loved it - even though it presented a challenge. You see, back then it was hard to go up the tiers and get RP/TP without premium or anyone in a platoon with me. I remember hitting T3 and getting the guns and going holy shit they got bigger! I had the same experience with everything until about half way through T4. At that point I was a low level but figured that I liked the game so I might as well support it. I bought the T7 Rebel and learnt more and more.  To me the tiered parts are there to help new players learn how to build they start small with the tiny T1 parts and move on every other tier to bigger and better things. All odd tier parts introduce the size difference while all even tier parts give players the stronger version.   With that said, FJ royally fucked up when they made it possibly to get to T10 in under seven hours. New players won't have any experience and will be confused by the availability of everything."
Robocraft,3cnyfi,Blue_Crusader,3,Thu Jul 9 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"I started shortly after the aerorods update, and got the game via the Humble Bundle sale (so started with Premium, and have had no experience of what it's like to grind without it). I reached T10 before the rebalancing update, but I've still got more to learn, I'm sure. The problems I've encountered are as follows;   The only reason I even knew the tech tree existed is because I stumbled across it while pressing the wrong keys in the interface. Even then, tiered TP confused me and I had to seek clarification from the robocraft wiki. No idea what platoons were or how to access the social interface until last week when someone invited me to a platoon and had to explain the social interface. Completely baffled by the beeping noise after I was invited to a platoon as I didn't notice the tiny white text on flashing red background in the corner of the screen that told me what was going on. Completely missed the robot tier indicator at the bottom of the garage until after I found the robocraft wiki that showed the tier gauge, was mystified by it, and then went looking for it ingame. Lost track of chat discussion if I looked away for more than 3 seconds when it got busy. Didn't find out about crystal seams until after I got suspicious about chunks of crystals disappearing all at once and went searching for more info on the net. Not enough RP to vary my designs while I progressed up the tech tree. I unlocked a lot of stuff, but could never take advantage of it. I camped at T6 for quite a while just to experiment with the variety of parts, and subsequently ended up with about 3,000 T6 TP. The usual glitches everyone else sees and experiences; falling through maps, shooting through terrain, latency issues, the two rotor instability after healing bug (fixed?), the ghost rudder bug (fixed), etc. Building a functional aircraft is excessively difficult. I had to spend quite some time reading and rebuilding to get something that could fly. The addition of Center of Mass, Center of Lift, and Center of Thrust indicators in the garage would make life a lot easier in this regard, as well as tutorials about all of these. There was no way to test the combat effectiveness of my bots without potentially letting down other players. There still isn't, but I don't think it's as much of a risk for me now that I know more about how to build a halfway decent bot (thank you again robocraft wiki).   I look forward to more tutorials being added to the game, which should clear up a lot of newbie confusion."

Robocraft,3cnyfi,Pamela4,2,Thu Jul 9 23:24:11 2015 UTC,"Early game movement sucks, badly. It's just plain frustrating. No one talks?! What is this! Needing to delete entire bot block by block to replace things Not having the entire variety of weapons early game makes it a bit dull   Otherwise been having good fun. There really needs to be a way to upgrade from one tier tech points to the next before you actually play though. No one likes being outclassed on gear, but when you find players being punished for their equipment with no non-cash currency way to rectify the disadvantage but brute forcing it, something's wrong. Basically, you need good gear, but you have to play against that quality of gear to get it - against players who probably have more experience and you probably being a detriment to your team. My biggest gripe besides the movement early game, no one likes carrying or being carried hard."

Well I have absolutely no ideas why people don't like this game. I enjoy a match even trolls are on my side because I can still shoot stuff and see other's designs.   One thing I want to mention is about the vision. That yellow fog of war is too op lol, I hope there's scope thing in the game that can increase your vision.  And also, if I tell you my bot is at 79% of health I don't think that's any useful. My chopper could be grounded at 79% or maybe still ok. I suggest a simulated diagram of your bot that shows your damage report at the left bottom of your screen.

I have a bunch of friends who play Minecraft, and love Minecraft. I thought they would love this game as well. So I introduced them to the game, this all the stuff I had to explain while introducing my friends to the game, because the game didn't have a tutorial:   CPU Limit Chat and How to use it Platooning System Tiering System What is Triforcing How each weapon works and what is a good play style for each weapon   I had to explain all this three times over...I introduced six of my friends to this game, the three that I explained all this too, still play with me today. They are now T6, T7, T5. The three that I did not explain all this too, came up to me and said that the game sucked. They were not happy, they said they enjoyed playing at first but it got boring quick. I told them to at least get  to T3 and then see if they still don't like the game, They say ""What is tier 3?"".

Robocraft,3cnyfi,IsilZha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:36:48 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved robocraft at the first hour. I'm at my 81st hour mark of playing right now, and on tier 8, and not planning on stopping anytime soon.  I love the fact that it's sometimes unforgiving for newbies, and that actually let me strive harder to learn more mechanics.  Back when I started, I was SO cocky that I thought I could build my own bot. I immediately deleted the contents of the first garage and spent almost 3 fucking hours to make a bot. I didn't even know there was a second garage! And when I discovered that, I tried the tier 1 plasma.  Tier 1 plasma, ugh. When I first got my hand on the plasma cruiser, I was like ""How the fuck does this even work?! wth, how can a bot same as me one shot me and I can't do the same to it?"". Then I played 2-3 more games and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED plasma.  Since then, I rushed tier 4 to create a flier, because I saw the ""Aerofoil"" on the techpoints thingy, and from that I also spent almost 2 hours to make a flier and end up looking it up on YT instead because I'm shit at it. But when I started, Oh the joy I felt flying around and landing plasma bombs on ground units.  Well, to be honest, this game let me use my brain and really think hard; one of the few last ones, actually. I'd like to keep it this way. A spoon-feeding game is a bad game.  I also like the grinding to higher tiers. It lets you have more experience, and that means more game knowledge so that you could advance through tiers with mostly wisdom, not luck.  TLDR. NEWBIE HERE, I LOVE THE GAME.  EDIT: I also love the fact that I need to do research on my own to know shit about this game, rather than it being just displayed on my in-game screen."

Just showed up before the team orders update. I enjoy the game, but have come across some stuff I really don't like.   The crystals don't change color or disappear when shot on my screen.  I wouldn't even know what to do if I didn't watch my friend play on his computer once. Chat is really bad, feels like an after thought.  Severe lack of information. I don't need a tutorial,  but a lot of stuff is vague. PFlops and Tier ranking seem redundant.  Maps are a mixed bag. Weird bumps and crevices make it hard for ground based units to move, even worse on lower tiers when the wheels are small. Tharsis rift has 1/3 of the map unused since they moved the towers. Hellion crater is easily the best map. Wide open, but still stuff to hide behind.  Good matches on thonium canyon, but only on the upper tiers. No fun if you have wheels or treads. Latency has been horrendous the past week or so. Used to be fine, but now the game stops like I got disconnected,  and then the game compensates and people zip around the screen to their present location.    Spent about $25 on this game, I enjoy it and hope they can fix some bugs so I can play it as they intended."

Robocraft,3cqnib,mitit1001,2,Fri Jul 10 02:11:47 2015 UTC,"I like your proposal, and I often thought about... the same? ...something similar?  Your idea could be easily implemented by just turning the railgun projectile into multiple (4?) almost simultaneous projectiles with the same trajectory. It would more easily penetrate tri-forced armor (which is a shame because it had been nerfed already), but it would have less impact on hardware hits because as soon as the, e.g., leg or weapon is destroyed, the remaining damage might miss the bot altogether because its path is empty now.  I believe this would be a good change because it rewards good aiming based on the analysis of the enemies chassis instead of just aiming for the weapons."
Robocraft,3cqnib,RealZeratul,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:41:27 2015 UTC,"Were you the same guy that said that in a thread somewhere? Anyway, I think it is a great idea. It becomes more dangerous in the hands of a skilled player and a lot less dangerous in a less skilled one. When you shoot at a brick, the damage pierces instead of spreading across the surface which is what sniper rifles do.  Now that I think about it, they might need to rework the damage values if this is implemented. They set it high so that the damage can ""creep"" from block to block. Now that it's directional, it could be too dangerous."
Robocraft,3cqnib,InfiniteSynapse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:22:18 2015 UTC,I feel like the dmg model for rail is fine. I don't see how this model would be any better.

It all depends on how they handle robot ranking and whether they will revert the robot ranking to a more sane progression.   If they keep it the same then a tier 3 bot will still fight tier 5 bots with a single tier 5 gun.
Robocraft,3cpwd9,ihatehappyendings,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:52:12 2015 UTC,They said they will adjust rr for this change.   Rr will be rebalanced to represent a cubes power level.  HIS POWER LEVEL IS OVER 9000!!!😰
Robocraft,3cpwd9,boybrushedplad,0,Fri Jul 10 01:06:47 2015 UTC,My point is the tier removal is cosmetic.
Robocraft,3cpwd9,ihatehappyendings,2,Fri Jul 10 03:56:15 2015 UTC,"It's not because with tiers people at the top of a tier play with people from the bottom of the tier.  With no tiers, matchmaking can be much better.   For example people at the bottom of the tier will be put with other people from the bottom of the tier~ as best as can be done with the game population at any given time."
Robocraft,3cpwd9,boybrushedplad,2,Fri Jul 10 05:07:20 2015 UTC,It used to be exactly like that when tiers were still present.  Matchmaking used to be 100% about RR even with tiers.  This is cosmetic.

Robocraft,3cpwd9,NotHomo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:23:33 2015 UTC,But there are fine boundaries between tier.  With this change they won't be there.   Something that would be a low t5 will play with high t4's .

Though he is wrong if thinks a well designed robot with fewer guns will beat a well designed gun bed with say 12 guns.    Because...the first thing you do is shoot off their guns.  That is survival 101 for a close combat ground unit like a gun bed. All the tri-forcing in the world won't save them if they have no guns.  If you think my pilot on my gunbed isn't well protected because he has 12 guns..well you are wrong.  I build the pilots area first then build the rest around him.  When you have a lot of guns..you can afford to have a few guns that are easy to shoot off.  Which allows more blocks for critical areas.  I recently tried hover gun beds because the latest thing on tanks is shoot off their treads so they can't move.  So now I have a 14 gun SMG hover with 12 hovers for redundancy (it can run on 6).  Well triforced center.  It goes faster then my tracked smg, and can take more damage, though has 200 fewer blocks (800 vs 1000)  Point is more guns does not make you weak against ""better built bots""."

I have seen some decent bots with plates, but they had probably 3k blocks and a few plates.  I only have ~3700 blocks (no plates) because I have 8 wheels and 9 guns..which take a lot of cpu.    I do like the 8 wheels, they act as side shields (from all their health) and rarely am i disabled where I can't move.   And it moves fine. I don't have the problems moving the 4 wheel guys do. I am convinced they are overloading their wheels.  Oh and I kept a high ground clearance (5 blocks up the center). I drove over 3 blues once that wouldn't get out of my way.  Surprised the hell out of them!

Robocraft,3cm7j5,AwesomeArab,-3,Thu Jul 9 02:45:18 2015 UTC,"Firstly, many complete, released games get DLCs, free or otherwise, that greatly modify/improve the game.   Secondly, defining software as an 'alpha release' suggests that it is an internal release, and is not released to anyone outside the organisation and/or an organisation hired to test it. Even Beta releases can be extremely limited, and the concept of taking money even for a Beta release is actually surprisingly modern.   These days many developers do charge for access to 'Alpha' releases, but rarely at full price, never using microtransactions, and definitely not for two straight years with no signs of advance to Beta in the near future.  Face it people, for better or for worse FreeJam is using you all"
Robocraft,3cm7j5,NorbiPeti,14,Thu Jul 9 02:58:10 2015 UTC,"Noo. The statuses alpha and beta describe what stage a program is in development not its availability to the public. Alpha is where, put simply, the game is being made. Features are added, removed and everything in between until they reach the game that they want to release. Beta is where you stamp out bugs, add quality of life and other minor things like new weapons, game modes etc... But the core game will never change. Currently RC is in ""public alpha"" which means that the game you play today can still vary greatly from the final release. Face it buddy, everyone here knew they were an alpha tester from day 1. We are alpha testers, the fact that we don't have to sign a sign up sheet to get to the alpha doesn't make this any less of one and definitely does not classify the game as ""released"". Neither do the micro transactions. They are just like kickstarter funds. FJ need money to finish the game so they add a way for the community to support them and get something out if it. TL;DR beta isn't just a publicity stamp. It has a meaning and would be a lie if FJ were to call RC a beta."

I hit Lv100 last October before megas and Battle Mode even came out, and the reason I stopped playing was because there was nothing left for me to do since I had everything and Classic Mode was simplistic and sorta repetitive. I think in the past people hit a similar point as me and just grew bored of the game. Even now after coming back to the game, I'd say megas are still unappealing to me and not the reason I am still playing. I personally like Battle Mode because you get far more dynamic fights than in Classic Mode (no follow-the-leader mash-up), and Battle Mode is now the reason I keep playing the game and will probably keep playing the game.  I think saying that ""people liked it back then"" is just plain wrong. People more likely grew tired of what Classic Mode had to offer and decided to stop playing."

Rules of building robot are not told anywhere. Stats like weight or robot ranking number are not shown when you build it and there are arbitrary rules like CPU limit for each tier that are not shown or told at all unless you read right patch notes. Only people with lot of experience know them.  2. There are some anti newbie mechanics in game like ""seams"" of crystal towers. At tier 1-5 battles most of the people do not know where to aim. That mechanics serves absolutely no purpose except giving advantage to experienced players or those who happened to stumble on right forum post.  3. Community is horrible. Today I was in team with 3 robots having 10 parts or less. One didn't even have any weapon. They just come to fool in battles with no interest in winning at all. It is very hard to keep interest in grinding game where you grind with team when most of team isn't even trying.  4.

Week after week I checked in to see how the state of the game was but I always felt something lacking, and in time I stopped launching the game all thoughter. It was not neccecerly the fact that the game was boring but it lacked the excitement, tension and what not. Perhaps because for instance, it was possible to respawn. The tension from having only one life per game was gone which I personally feel made the game worse. The maps feelt really empty and chipping away at a tower for a few minutes to capture it and to only lose it again was really unrewardning.

Robocraft,3cm7j5,Corsair3820,2,Thu Jul 9 17:40:41 2015 UTC,"Classic mode is still alive, so I don't know if you can say they ""essentially replaced"" their game, but the new battle mode's ""bright lights, big city"" promise of greater riches makes it rather difficult to get into a classic match, even harder to get into a good and balanced one.  I had the same fizzling out reaction to the MOBA mechanics. If I had to call out one thing that fostered this, I'd say the win/loss duality of the MOBA game is far less exciting than Classic.   Explanation nobody asked for: The protonium reactors are whittled down to naught, and one will fall. This is a predictable, dare I say boring, inevitability on the road to victory, unless a bug occurs. There is no chance that a lackluster push will fail to take a few protonium bits, even though a lackluster push could easily lead to a strong push from the enemy. This is different from true MOBAs, which have AI mobs and turrets to mop up stragglers and suicide bombers.  Meanwhile, in Classic, a victory or loss hinges on the piecemeal damage your own robot takes. In comparison to the reactors, this damage is far more nuanced. A weak spot could be hit, leading to any number of cubes being lost, as opposed to the towers and their static seams. The weapons could be popped off first. Wings robbed. Hover blades unstabilized. Thanks to the walker/medic update, this damage isn't even permanent.  15 minutes of ""samey,"" 7 or less minutes of ""rarely the same."""
Robocraft,3cm7j5,DimitriV,2,Fri Jul 10 02:41:27 2015 UTC,"That sums it up pretty nicely, actually. I was always fond of games where victory could be decided by one robot, limping over to the enemy base with a single wheel. The new MOBA stuff doesn't really have room for that.  And yes, that's kind of what I meant the ""essentially"" to mean. Classic is still there, but it's sort of the appendix of Robocraft now."

Why not use those parts against enemies who can use same power parts?"
Robocraft,3cm7j5,Namell,3,Thu Jul 9 04:28:29 2015 UTC,Overtiering was definitely a problem: trying to get TP in tiers where other players have parts two tiers above what you can was not fun.  But it seems that they've gone too far in the other direction. (Not allowing any armor blocks out of tier?  Really?)  I got discouraged once the updates started breaking my favorite bots.  I haven't bothered to build new ones because why bother when they'll probably be obsoleted in a future update?  I plan to wait and see when/if things settle down before getting back into the game.
Robocraft,3cm7j5,BukkitBoss,3,Thu Jul 9 05:07:49 2015 UTC,"You can have armour blocks out of tier. It's about armour class. So you can have 100 T10 cubes, then 80 T2, 80 T3, 80 T4 etc. Since the majority of cubes is T10, your armour class is T10."

I am currently at tier 5 and it took me about half tier before I could afford enough tier 5 armor blocks to build my bot. Most people in my tier are using lower blocks.  Allowing someone to use higher tier armor blocks would make them very overpowered compared to new player who can not really afford to even buy their own tier blocks.

Robocraft,3cm7j5,cebeide,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:38:35 2015 UTC,"I feel a big reason for that though is that guns allow you to instantly tier up, and hold a rank.  I've been replaying my way through the game, and in T4 I'd say 50% of the bots I encounter are mostly T3 armor, with a large amount of T1-2 armor blocks and movement parts. The only reason they've managed to tier up is due to the fact that their guns float them in their current tier.  Before the update these bots wouldn't have been tiered up, and the players would be forced to upgrade their armor and movement parts before ascending the tier ladder. It didn't matter that they had a T4 gun, if their armor was all T1 they wouldn't have had enough Roboranking to make it."

Robocraft,3cm7j5,HadrasVorshoth,0,Thu Jul 9 07:20:10 2015 UTC,"Very few things got really ""buffed"".   Rails and plasma got increased damage, but got meta-nerfed by the introduction of tank treads and helicopter rotors - these are very big parts that can be used en masse and soak up so much damage that the improvement to guns isn't even noticeable. Cruisers not only got nerfed by the ""awesome drift feature"" - the reduced grip also made bots with multiple pairs of steering wheels (think BTR-80) steer horribly; with higher speed, easier redundancy, and less space requirements T5 sleds are superior to T10 wheels in every aspect now, which shouldn't really happen. Hovers... poor hovers, is there any reason to use them now? Fliers - hit by multiple nerfs, but their main downside in Battle mode (post-repair glitches) still hasn't been fixed. Walkers - fairly decent as I'd say after playing them for a long time (totally better than wheels and hovers as they are now), but suffer from repair glitches (again, Battle mode screwed this over with frequent repairs), the changes to alignment rectifier (which now can't turn over large bots) and the buffs to rail and plasma (I'd say they deserve the armor values of treads in the current meta to become common - the placement restrictions and bot size make up for it as a downside).   Basically, Freejam managed to nerf everything that was fun and challenging to build and play with... at least that's the reason I stopped playing the game."

Robocraft,3cm7j5,Aetherimp,2,Thu Jul 9 01:36:09 2015 UTC,"I think most of the declining player base comes from players who dislike the new changes, me being one of them. I don't get why the no-overtiering change is defended by some people. Before you down vote, let me explain why. The way it currently is, you can fit a whole lot of on-tier guns and a lot of -1 tier armor blocks on 2 tank tracks and roll around killing people. Anything less than that is not as efficient. The CPU restrictions to counter the new messed up roboranking and also the minimum armor requirements really limit creativity combined with the hover nerf, wheel drifting, low aerofoil and rudder armor, and walker legs' giant size with only one connection point, also combined with copter blades and their ability to fly perfectly fine with just 2 rotors forces people to use builds such as bricks with tank treads or bricks with rotor blades. Anything else is not as efficient.   Also, no overtiering and increased level xp gain allows people to rush through the tiers. You can basically jump to the next tier by adding 1 gun of that tier on your bot.   Another thing (for my friends and I) is that gameplay can be repetitive and boring. Combine that with the new flood of inexperienced players in T10 (people in T10 with bots that belong in T8 and play like they're in T3), and you have a frustrating, aggravating, and boring experience. Every time I start playing a new game, it either ends in a steamroll of the other team, or me sitting there frustrated because my teammates know little to nothing about strategy or gameplay mechanics. Since the new meta update, I rarely played solo because I knew there would always be a few people on my team running around like headless chickens yolo rushing and dying.  I have stopped playing as of around 2 weeks ago with no plans to come back. Thats saying a lot considering I used to play around 6 hours a day average and during the peak of my robocraft addiction, would clock 8 hours a day while having school for 7 hours. I also spent $106 and still have about 2 years of premium and a nice little stash of GC left, but oh well."
Robocraft,3cm7j5,Aetherimp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:02:12 2015 UTC,"I think its a temporary thing.  Most people still have never even heard of the game.  Alpha games get very little press coverage.  I started in May 2015. I like the changes and look forward to what is coming.  I am playing less..because I have everything unlocked..have 8 bots (1 mega) and tons of RP. and tired of the maps. .But I am in no way stopping. Just playing less while I wait for the August update.  I like I can change my bots when they change the rules.  If Rails get over powered..well I will make a rail.  Healers suck atm score wise...so I stopped running my healers unless in a platoon that needs one.  In Robocraft adapting to changes is easy if you willing to redo your robots. which for  me, is half the fun.  As for the hover nerf..all my bots are hovers except the Mega and 1 drone. Yeah they go slower, but still faster then wheels or tracks (because wheels overload too easy).  I took apart my 1000 block 12 gun tracked tank. Now its 12 hovers, 800 blocks 2 thrusters and 14 guns. And 12 hovers is for redundancy.  It can lose 1/2 the hovers and still fly. Its just as beastly as before..and goes faster then tracks.    You all forget one thing, its new players and spend the most. and while the game is free, they intend to make money.  In the end I think they will attract new players. I think the best is yet to come!  Let the bitter vets go."

Robocraft,3cm7j5,Aetherimp,-2,Thu Jul 9 17:19:12 2015 UTC,"This thread is a whole lot of old-fags complaining and blowing smoke up each others asses about ""the good ol' days"" ..  This game is still new. I played League, put 1k hours into DayZ SA, probably twice that into DayZ mod, and probably about 1k into CS:GO in recent history. Saw my long time gaming friend playing Robocraft on stream and decided to check it out, and have been playing it non-stop since.   Battle-mode is better than Classic mode. It's more competitive, and appeals to a broader audience. Get over it. Either adapt to the new Meta or go drown in your own tears.  While I understand people getting upset that a game they liked changed away from what they were used to, I think it's a rather naive and immature attitude. If you're still coming to the Reddit and tracking the player-base while you haven't logged in to the game in over a month, then I'm sorry to be so harsh, but you seriously need to get a fucking life.   Based on the changes I've seen so far, and based on what I have heard about how the game ""used"" to be, I am excited about what FJ has in store for the future. Games don't balance themselves, and it takes a long time adjusting and tweaking things to get it ""right"".. I played Age of Empires III for over a year and can honestly say that no matter how much the devs tried, they could never properly balance the game .... and this was a microsoft studio! With a team and resources that far surpass what FJ has at their disposal.   Look at Riot and League of Legends.. The game always has imbalances and especially so early on. The difference here being that the classes/weapons can actually be balanced because they can be held in a relatively static state in relation to one another.. thus there can be comparison and gentle tweaks. With as many Civs as AOEIII had, and with as many champions as League has, changing just a few numbers around can change the whole meta for better or worse. In RC, you have a handful of movement types and 3-5 weapons (Depending on how you classify Teslas/Nanos)  As far as the Alpha/Beta/Micro-Transactions argument..   Game is not Pay to win, so who cares? Nobody is forcing you to pay anything. The only advantage to paying anything is supporting the devs and getting ""cool stuff"". Alpha Pre-release whatever the fuck is just a trend in the industry. At least this game doesn't cost 30 dollars, like DayZ StandAlone did ON THE DAY THAT ALPHA OPENED TO THE PUBLIC. You can't hate on FJ for calling this game ""Alpha"" or ""pre-release"". At least they aren't charging you to test it.   The game may be going through a decline in over-all player-base, but as old-fags leave, more noobs are coming along every day, and as long as FJ makes positive changes (which is what they were doing to scare off people like the OP), then they will retain players and begin to grow. As more players come along, it will bring content creators (youtube/twitch), and that exposure will bring more players.   In short - Give it time. Let FJ do their thing. If you don't like it, nobody is forcing you to play. There are thousands of games on steam. Go play one of them and stop trolling the RC reddit when you don't even play the game anymore."
Robocraft,3cm7j5,Aetherimp,7,Thu Jul 9 03:34:14 2015 UTC,"The game has been losing players for a year now, far longer than the average player plays for. It has just over a third of its peak playerbase remaining and it is losing that last third fast.   Where, pray tell, are these noobs coming from, and when?"
Robocraft,3cm7j5,Hudston,-8,Thu Jul 9 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"The game is hardly over a year old. I can only assume that when the game first came out people saw ""NEW FREE GAME?! BUILD ROBOTS AND FIGHT THEM?! COOL!"".. So player-base jumped up, and probably grew for quite a while as new people got involved and got their friends involved.   People get bored, lose interest, or get upset and QQ over changes, so they leave.. Some come back, some don't. Player base goes down. Meanwhile, the game continues to grow and get better and slowly get more and more exposure. Natural growth takes a while. There was a ""core group"", and that ""core group"" established the game so that other, new players could trickle in.   As I said, I found the game through a friend who played it on Twitch, and he has exposed others to the game, and I have exposed at least a few people to it.. So there's some ""noobs"" right there for you; and I see new players in chat every day.  It may take a while for the growth to out-pace the decline, but as the game gets older and more established and they continue to add features it's bound to reach equilibrium with or without the early adopters. This is a common pattern. It happens for television shows, fashion trends, youtube channels, or any form of entertainment, really.   I'd say the odds that the player-base will eventually surpass it's previous peak are about 90%. Of course, there's the off chance that the game just dies, but I find that hard to believe. I'm generally pretty picky with games I play and I personally enjoy the shit out of this game, so I am sure others (will) feel the same."

Robocraft,3clggl,lemonsnausage,3,Thu Jul 9 01:04:28 2015 UTC,"It's mind-boggling to imagine how robo-ranking would have to be changed to make things balanced, but I'm pretty sure tiering is partially to blame for said mega death tanks in the first place.  Without tiers, balancing the CPU-usage to robot-ranking ratio could be slightly easier. You could even factor in CPU-usage in the robo-ranking, making those death tanks face tougher opponents. As for the megabots, the absurdly large RR values the TX-1 parts use to ensure bots that use them are placed in T10/TX-1 could come down, making weakling megabots a big, but not unwelcome, target in less-than-what-once-was-T10. Imagine a megabot made of T1-T4 cubes and one gun winding up being classified in what is currently the ""T8"" range. Someone might have to bite the M-SMG bullet, maybe even getting one-shotted, but then, all bots on a team in should be able to contribute at least one kill per spawn. In any case, I think such troll megabots would be more welcome as a bullet-sponge amongst people with less RR.  Perhaps robot-ranking could also factor in how ""structurally-sound"" a bot is. I'm not sure how that would be calculated, though, at least not without the ability to probe various robot builds with actual sources of damage."
Robocraft,3clggl,VonGod,2,Thu Jul 9 01:50:47 2015 UTC,"A rather simple method from someone who is completely ignorant and hasn't played in a while;  White Block (Cube) can only supply X total points of RR no matter how many, with Y assigned per cube  White Block (Prism)....  you get the idea."

It would also be nice to have an indication of what tier you're in but not base matchmaking based solely on tier, just to track your progress."
Robocraft,3clggl,AwesomeArab,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:00:20 2015 UTC,How about effectively no ranking sub Tier 10.  Have the the <T10 equivalent bots be matched purely on RR. Your ELO rank can be built based on your performance but doesn't affect match making yet.  Once your bot hits would have been T10 you get matched based on your ELO rank instead of or as well as your robot rank.

Robocraft,3clggl,mitit1001,5,Wed Jul 8 23:22:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly it just seems like a balancing nightmare. How many blocks are equivalent to a gun? Is it possible to sneak in a T10 rail into a T5 match because the combined roboranking of all the T5 components add up? I think of all systems, this is the most complicated to test and balance out."
Robocraft,3clggl,KingAtlasKDM,3,Wed Jul 8 22:19:11 2015 UTC,"You are probably right, that it would be hard to balance out, but think back to before the meta, games were fairly balanced. Of course, you had the occasional +3 rail, but those were rare and could be dealt with easily with a slight RR increase to prevent +3 OT. If you look at the RR, it is pretty much an exponential curve for all parts (or even more? I never took the time to plot and fit the RR) which is why it works so well."
Robocraft,3clggl,Drovious17,2,Wed Jul 8 22:55:39 2015 UTC,If this means I can use low tier parts for their smaller size without being made of tissue paper (instead only a minor tradeoff) then I'm all for it.  These chopper blades are a bit too big for my britches.
Robocraft,3clggl,TheSploot,2,Wed Jul 8 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"i think it would be a nice balance since the RR would proably be calculated by amount of health of the armor, + amount of damage by the weapons. i think they would have to have some restrictions to avoid having sudo mega bots, and having an unbalance of teams due to it, but it would be nice to have a mixed balance of bots if there is some sort of player skill ranking."
Robocraft,3clggl,cebeide,2,Thu Jul 9 01:00:54 2015 UTC,"Great idea, and honestly simplifies the game, whilst removing perceived restrictions."
Robocraft,3clggl,dethb0y,3,Thu Jul 9 07:13:28 2015 UTC,"I posted this some weeks ago:   Remove the tiers Base the match making in the level (no more seal clubbing) All the current parts and sizes would be avaliable, bigger parts would have more armor/damage/speed to compensate but if you want to build a small  robot with ""t1"" parts it would be playable in lvl 100 games: it would be harder to hit but it would deal less damage and have less armor than one built with ""t10"" parts. You start unlocking the t1 sized parts and as you advance you get bigger, stronger versions.   Marks proposal would remove min-maxing: if you have a robot with max robot ranking for tier 7 with that system it could be paired against tier 8 builds.  And we would have overtiering (you carry less guns but stronger ones) back and landships/artbots back.     Right now the robot ranking system is broken to prevent seal clubbing but it allowed more flexibility and it was more fun."

As it stands, it can be painful when you first move into another tier and don't have the RP or TP/EXP to upgrade all of your parts. They'll have to be careful with matchmaking so that the maximum RR range isn't too big and the queue times aren't too long, but it could definitely have merit.  The necessary RR tweaking will probably be a little painful for a while, but tbh, it probably wouldn't be a terrible idea to change cube tiers either -- it already seems silly to have to manually update every cube when functionality is almost identical, and the removal of tiered games would make that even moreso."

Robocraft,3clggl,DumberMonkey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:12:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this will get lost in the sea of comments, but here goes:  I liked a tier system. It's what separates the free play VS pay to win.  Before, it was grind a tier, build and rebuild, adjust your equipment and upgrade until you can make it to the next level by affording higher tier equipment and working on your CPU level so you can get in the next tier without looking like a bum. The grind made you a better player because it forced that one thing that the game doesn't have an obvious value for - experience.  With the changes the tier system, T10 is now flooded with crappy bots. Brick tanks, brick snipers, and copy-paste bots built from tutorials (Ballz!). I fear a tier-less system will do little to prevent this, if not encourage it. From my limited understanding, they want to get rid of the tech tree AND now the tiers. So, in thought then, it will become pay to win? Your only main separation is CPU level, but with premium that's an easier grind, and god only knows if they're considering doing something drastic with that too.  So, I'm pretty reserved about this. I don't understand what they're going to do, none of us really do, but I'd favor a few steps back and some minor changes to address their concerns VS a  paradigm shift like this. Stop the downward spiral with small changes first, then look at the big picture again with a healthier player base."

Because you cant keep the idiots out of your groups, because FJ wont allow full platoons teams vs full platoon teams.  Yet, you think that that removing tiers will fix it.

Use of material, which is subject to the rights of any person or entity without the express permission of such rights holder, is prohibited, and will result in the termination of the Account and possible civil and/or criminal liability;  17 - Reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble all or any portion of the Website, Game or other services.   Example 1: They are probably fine with you using the mars background. Example 2: I'm not quite sure what you mean here. If you mean the text ""Bay 01"" at the beginning you can do that of course. Example 3: I've explained this one in your other topic on the .dds files. Low poly copies of models based on reference images. But they are done very well so it's easy to mistake them for the real deal.  If you are still in doubt consider sending /u/Drognin a message here, or ask FJ support.

I am very new to 3d and have just learned how to texture map with png files.

P.S. for some lols, my other half read this and told me ""Your asking them for permission?

Now I'm no 3D hero either, and I'm not sure if this would work but: If the UVmap regions from the .dds are the same as the ones in your exported png png, couldn't you open them both in Photoshop and copy the contents from the dds into the png?

Robocraft,3clt3b,DumberMonkey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:30:16 2015 UTC,"Actually if they fix it so you can't cover half the map from the safety of rails..that would be fine.  Rails that get away from the bubble..usually I can kill pretty easy. but the ones that duck in and heal and come out, isn't fair game play. But I already read the new map will fix that..and they plan to eventually fix all the maps.  While I don't like the 6 shots being on the receiving end..if I start moving after the 1st shot..chances are the rest either won't hit or will hit in a different spot (which is better usually).  So my only problem is rails that don't have to leave the bubble or not far enough to be in danger.  You will notice in classic where there is no bubble, rails are almost non-existent.   Played a game tonight, only 2 ground units on our team..think the same on red. We had 2 rails they had 4. Rest were flyers both teams (one healer each). (1 of their rails was a copter)  We could control 2 of the towers pretty easy..but not the one in sight of their bubble. and all rushes to the tower failed miserably.  But we did win.  The two of us hover plasma bots (ground plasmas at OC13) snuck in the side while they were busy keeping their one tower.  When they attack you and you are in their bubble..they tend to be close and easy to kill. And OC13 plasmas blow a big chunk of bubbles off the reactor at a time.  bottom line, while the rails were a pain, it didn't save them. And it left them with no easy way to do towers (rails suck at towers). So while I like  rails on my team, I rather not have more then 2."

Of course, rails should be a counter to air, but they shouldn't be a hard counter grounding everything.  Remember pre-TARO update times? Shot intervals between rail shots actually gave you time to look for where the shot comes from and decide if you want to charge the rail or duck for cover. Now it is like MG fire coming out of a sniper cannon.  Option 2 seems like a pretty cool idea and I think it was how rails were first introduced, but I am not sure if this would make it too hard to hit anything. You might have to remove the laser sight so your enemy doesn't know that you are aiming at him for 1,5s because any person in its right mind will be running for cover once he sees that dot appearing."

Robocraft,3cn4tw,DumberMonkey,2,Thu Jul 9 15:19:20 2015 UTC,"Those rail copters are sure good at aiming though, and I give 'em props for that. Same goes for T-sticks, since I'd never nail as to how they pilot those things well. i hate 'em, but I respect their skill as well.  I'd say they're a thing because even if rotors bob up and down, a competent railer can still aim and shoot, albeit not as accurate as a still shot would. Plus, spamming rotors are harder to take down, and provides a clear view of the whole map.  Usually these types of crafts are weak against counter rails or even interceptors, since their atrocious reloading time's against them. Even if they hide in the shield, they can still be left vulnerable if the towers are captured.  If you encounter one and you think they ground's clear, try flying above or under it; anywhere that is as close you can be and away from his guns. It's hard for rails to shoot at a moving target, let alone one right at their face. A few volleys at their back rotors will do the trick, or in some cases, a single shot at an exposed seat."

Robocraft,3cjio2,malum-panem,6,Wed Jul 8 14:18:05 2015 UTC,"League of Legends does that and it helps players understand why devs do what they do. As long as it is reasonable, I think people would at least try to understand."

Robocraft,3cjio2,AverageBe,6,Wed Jul 8 14:53:43 2015 UTC,I think rails should punch a 2x2 hole without dispersed damage and somewhat lower damage.
Robocraft,3cjio2,Tezorian,3,Wed Jul 8 13:27:50 2015 UTC,"As far as i can tell, the reasoning behind changes, nerfs and buffs are numbers. Plain RAW numbers. I assume you would have no doubts about changes if the reasoning behind them was the “why”.  The stats about weapon usage that have been posted a few times is a clear example. It showed how the balance of weapon usage is in each tier. It says nothing about why a certain weapon is used more than others, unless it’s a new weapon type unlocked for the tier.  As a player who plays every type, you know that every weapon requires a different playstyle and that one requires more skill/experience than others. If would say that from easy to hard, it would be nano, smg, rail, plasma. It feels to me that FreeJam is (almost?) completely ignoring that part, when it comes down to making changes."
Robocraft,3cjio2,Fish-Dead,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:18:20 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, raw number wise. I feel though people are, in the standard mode, under using weapons because of their perceptions and longevity.  I don't envision a lot of snipers really love going the distance to fulfill a role for an objective game because once the lulz wear off, then the sitting and waiting begins. No capping, no change in playstyle. Same to a much lesser extent with plasma - I feel like I see more flying smgs trying to wedge themselves in tower openings to shoot crystals than I see plasma bombers throw 3 point shots to cap through the roof hole."

Still a valid request to hear reasons for balancing, could only help soothing the community over this kind of things."
Robocraft,3cjio2,Never-Wolf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"I like your appeal for FreeJam to explain the reasoning behind all their changes. I like your proposals for solutions to rails being weak in late game battle mode. I don't think the 15% more damage is a problem. Rails should do absurd amounts of damage anyway. It'd be like buffing tesla to 15% more. You'd be going from getting torn in half by them to... still getting torn in half by them.   15% just means that it will eat through about 2 more blocks than it would have before. My advice when facing rails is to simply avoid getting hit by them at all costs and attack them opportunistically. When they're reloading, when they're aiming at someone else, when they don't have a good angle to shoot at you before you can eat them with tesla; these are all good examples of how to defeat a rail. I only ever get shot by rails when I'm engrossed in another target and it's my mistake for forgetting to keep cover. And I only attack them when they're near their bubble if I already happen to be with in tesla range. Rails and plasma bombers keep you on your toes, so I really don't mind if it's less forgiving to be hit by one."
Robocraft,3cjio2,Blue_Crusader,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:45:07 2015 UTC,To me it feels like freejam has reasons and statistics for the changes but fail to apply them properly. For example freejam might look and see that not that many people play rails and think that its because they are not good enough and they then buff them where in actuality it might just be that people do not find rails fun to play. Correlation =/= causation  Telling the community that they buff rails for reason x or y would help us understand their reasoning even if its flawed.

Robocraft,3cmuj6,NorbiPeti,3,Thu Jul 9 07:11:18 2015 UTC,At least you only need steam to update the game. You can go to ~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Robocraft in the file explorer and make a shortcut of Robocraft.x86 or Robocraft.x86_64 depending on your computer and you won't have to open Steam every time you want to play.

I'm not sure, but I'm guessing you're going to need NifTools or something similar as a plugin for Blender to be able to work with .dds files.

Robocraft,3ck6tm,mitit1001,4,Wed Jul 8 15:32:19 2015 UTC,Compared to SMG - Yes. But I dont find it to hard too snipe. Its more of a situational thing. And you need tactics and situational awareness to keep you in a good postion.  I find Plasma if nor from directly above and on a moving target harder to use.
Robocraft,3ck6tm,boborossa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"I find rails to be hard for similar reasons. Also, I don't have the patience to do a lot of sitting."
Robocraft,3ck6tm,ThunderLuigi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:58:19 2015 UTC,"i mostly play with plasma and rails, and i find rails harder than plasma, sure its easy to be an average/bad rail, but to be a good rail, one needs to pay A LOT of attention to the map, the skies and your enemies bots, remember where to shoot each bot, etc.  i guess people are used to bad rails who simply shoot randomly and at best don't do more than simply shooting huge rotors/treads or something.  also ever tried shooting a flier circling above you? its not easy, but doable with practice."
Robocraft,3ck6tm,wizardcourt,2,Thu Jul 9 02:10:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think there is any tactics involved in sniping across the whole map. You just watch out for your tanks, if they struggle in a fight, put a few shots into the enemy they are fighting. If your tanks are currently not engaging in a fight, shoot down bombers or other rails. No more tactics than any other weapon type if you ask me"
Robocraft,3ck6tm,VonGod,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:49:14 2015 UTC,The only thing keeping me away from rails is pressure. I don't know where I'm supposed to be on maps... I haven't experimented with Rails much.

Robocraft,3ck6tm,Tayette,2,Wed Jul 8 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"Well, smg are a no brainer now that they nerfed hard tap fire. nano gun, well do I need to dicuss this?  Now rail vs plasma: Both are skilled weapon but with rail you actually need to aim for specific part of the enemy bot to get critical damage, plasma are hard to land but if you get a good shot you should be good where ever you shot."
Robocraft,3ck6tm,Tayette,0,Wed Jul 8 18:22:40 2015 UTC,"As for rail V plasma, the point is that you can spam out 6 shots so quickly that only Thrustersticks and the most agile fliers are able to duck behind cover before you shot them 6 times, which makes good aim almost unnecessary. The point is that especially Tsticks and fliers usually melt away with way less than 6 shots."
Robocraft,3ck6tm,ThunderLuigi,2,Wed Jul 8 18:45:21 2015 UTC,And after those six shots... you're as good as a bot with no weapons at all. Seems like a fair trade off.
Robocraft,3ck6tm,TheAero1221,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:19:13 2015 UTC,"Not if you sit next to your shield, comfortably wait in there for a reload and then spam out another 6 shots. By then everything should be done for unless there is a medic nearby."

Robocraft,3ck6tm,radyjko,2,Thu Jul 9 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"Considering how annoying I find from-shield snipers, I don't have much problem with them.

Robocraft,3ck6tm,Anormalcat,2,Wed Jul 8 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"Why not have rails 'charge up?' The longer you hold left click the more powerful the shot, and the longer the cooldown time. You have a maximum of 6 rails at any given time, that you have to strategically use. You could fire 6 uber-high power shots in a small window of time, but that will mean that you're out of shots for a significant time period. Or, you could continuously fire a stream of lower power shots, and never have to worry about cooldown."

I think that the ""HEY LOOK SOMEBODY'S SNIPING"" laser should be visible to the sniper who is firing though  I wonder what they could do against spider bots to make them less useful as snipers, or require more skill, Because those bastards can just scale the best sniping position imaginable and plink people"

Robocraft,3ck6tm,Namell,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:41:41 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem if anyone goes back into the shield for heals, that's the purpose of the shield after all, you see me dashing back and forth with both my sled and my bomber all the time. The problem I have is those walker / copter things that just fly up to the CLOSEST cliff to snipe down the whole map almost always bringing the match to a stalemate. Those are not only slowing down the gameplay but are also really annoying since there is basically no way of countering them. Any bomber will be pulverised in 6shots and all land-based craft are picked apart as they approach the railer since he makes sure to retreat into shield once he loses 1% health.  I am not saying that rail can't be a high-skill weapon, just as it is currently played, it is pretty much the lowest skill weapon in the game. I actually do take the time to thank my railers when they save me from a bad situation, so I am not trying to say Rails stupid, get rid of them, I just want to make their gameplay a little less of shield camping."
Robocraft,3ck6tm,LittleGitten,2,Wed Jul 8 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"It's the maps, if they were better designed then I wouldn't be within arms reach of the shield all the time, the map with a green tinge (I can remember what it's called) is a map I can't really spawn camp on there is way to much cover, on that map if I want the kills I have to push with my team, same go's for the ice cave map, unless I'm playing defence with a very aggressive opposition I have to get at least on top of the cave to achieve anything."
Robocraft,3ck6tm,boybrushedplad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:47:31 2015 UTC,"Your argument makes my head hurt. Rails are not the lowest skill weapons by far. Plasma is just toss a bunch of AOE at someone and if it hits yay, if it knocks off all their guns in 1 volley, yay. if it kills them in 1 shot, even better. You may say that gauging plasma drop off may take skill, but the fact that its AOE kills that argument because you dont actually have to hit the person, just anywhere around them. With rails you actually have to hit something on thier bot to do dmg. Coptors are easy targets when they just sit still, but most players don't sit still, trying to hit a bomber that is flying at speed is actually fairly hard to hit, add that fact to our very slow reload compared to our dmg, plasma is just the noob tube of robocraft."
Robocraft,3ck6tm,TheAero1221,2,Wed Jul 8 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"Well now that 90% of bots are flying ones plasma users have to adapt to fight air targets, and that requires more skill."
Robocraft,3ck6tm,boybrushedplad,5,Wed Jul 8 20:28:00 2015 UTC,"Looking at those railers in T10 that sit inside / right next to their shield and snipey snipey across half the map without a problem.  Such skill, many danger, wow"
Robocraft,3ck6tm,TheAero1221,3,Wed Jul 8 15:33:19 2015 UTC,Perhaps Rails should have their damage halved when their lasers go out the shield.
Robocraft,3ck6tm,InfiniteSynapse,6,Wed Jul 8 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"That won't solve the sniping from right next to the shield, which is just equally annoying. The real problem here is that most maps have nice high mountains around the base from where you have at least half map coverage and full sky coverage."

Robocraft,3cg2ld,Rjected,2,Wed Jul 8 00:44:00 2015 UTC,No need for that.  The reduced damage would already lower it.
Robocraft,3cg2ld,IsilZha,-1,Wed Jul 8 01:26:26 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be lowered, they are two different things. Tesla blades do massive damage, but have terrible protonivity. Very much not the same."

EDIT: Sorry, before I didn't mean pronotivity was already being lowered under a damage reduction, but the damage reduction itself would hit the crystal damage.  There's no need to hit it would a double damage debuff vs crystals.  Keep in mind SCUs won't be limited to specific weapons - if a non-nano wanted to take such an SCU (which for sake of example, this one would be medic oriented) they would also eat the damage reduction."
Robocraft,3cg2ld,IsilZha,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:02:39 2015 UTC,"Well medics with self heal will have it's focus dedicated on surviving and keeping his team alive so any changes on protonivity would not really impact a medic's performance but that's only on solo medic games. In a game with 2 or more, it could be troublesome since they can attack and heal up. Reduce medic protonivity by the number of medics per team perhaps? Even a tesla damage nerf should be implemented solely for meds."
Robocraft,3cg2ld,InfiniteSynapse,9,Wed Jul 8 08:06:48 2015 UTC,"In theory this sounds like an excellent idea, believe me I'm all in favour. However the fundamental issue I see is when you have multiple medics auto healing other medics plus the passive regeneration could be quite the difficult tank to break. It could be combated by by a EP style cool down though  But hell, we're still in alpha and it could be quite an interesting dynamic to see in play. Would certainly make for some interesting group plays."
Robocraft,3cg2ld,Rred8118,8,Tue Jul 7 17:18:19 2015 UTC,Here's how I would do it personally - Have a component that slowly regenerates your bot - make it significant in CPU like 100. Then add this benefit split 1/6th to all nano guns (so medics themselves don't require it on the bot). Then make it so it turns off while actually being healed by another bot (nano heal prioritized over passive). Likely the balance would be somewhere around 1 gun (or less) worth of autoheal.
Robocraft,3cg2ld,zjat,2,Tue Jul 7 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"I like everything except the ""1/6th to all guns"", because then if one gun gets shot off it becomes pointless."

Robocraft,3cg2ld,PapoochCZ,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:25:10 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, the autoheal would only turn on after some extent of time (e.g. 10 seconds), provided you're neither shooing nor being shot at (or being healed) in that window. It would automatically turn off should any of the above happen."
Robocraft,3cg2ld,wizardcourt,0,Wed Jul 8 09:56:00 2015 UTC,"that would still make medics too good, because they're already too good, honestly, medics are too important in the game atm, having a single medic while the other team has none(or having 2 while the other team has one/none) is game changing(and basically a free win, unless your team sucks horribly), medics shouldn't be THIS good."
Robocraft,3cg2ld,gaso,4,Tue Jul 7 18:53:05 2015 UTC,I hope they prioritize balancing medics with the highest weight in this new matchmaking / Elo rating setup they're putting together...
Robocraft,3cg2ld,zjat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"This is the idea behind an auto heal component.

Robocraft,3cg2ld,ilgnome,3,Tue Jul 7 20:19:29 2015 UTC,I've always thought that medics should self-heal a % of what they actively heal. Means a medic WANTS to be healing and will most likely be in combat but doesn't want to get shot as no more nanos = no more self-heal.  This heal should diminish greatly when being actively healed by another medic.

Robocraft,3cg2ld,DumberMonkey,7,Thu Jul 9 10:08:11 2015 UTC,I agree. I think it should be a module that anyone can add to slowly regen.  A repair module if you will.  EDIT: well read a few more replies. Self Healing would be awesome.  But I would still like to see a healing module for anyone.  (especially mega's where you wait to die because your guns are gone and you have no medic and classic doesn't have a healing bubble)
Robocraft,3cg2ld,NotHomo,2,Tue Jul 7 18:36:29 2015 UTC,i always thought healing modules would be a good idea.  make them have a build around restriction like guns so you can't easily bury them inside your bot and having them makes you structurally weaker if you do that.  or takes up gun and plating real estate if you tack them on the outside (and makes them easily targeted)  definitely a good niche item that provides new gameplay  actually now that i think about it you could just take the radar receiver module and use that for it.  fold the receiver functionality into existing radars (kind of silly to have radar and receiver be two units anyways)
Robocraft,3cg2ld,hrkristian,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:10:05 2015 UTC,"You want a slow self healing component to be easily shot off in a game where damage is done by shooting things off?   That completely defeats the purpose of it, and you'd just see bots built with a large inner space to accommodate the healer. There's no legitimate reason to make it any larger than, say, the old rectifier, especially if you make it cost a boatload of CPU, which makes more sense. The last thing we need is further limitations on build, we're already at a point where builds are too homogenised as it is. You have one type of (functional) rail walker, maybe two (the railtable, or the walking parking lot if you will), one type of tank (the stairmaster), one type of medic hover (the shieldcube), etc. All because FJ loves huge guns that forces you into huge builds to be viable. Worst is, there aren't many arguments for having huge guns, glass cannons are shit and tanks are awesome, the more armour the better, so you're really just hurting creativity."

Robocraft,3cg2ld,hrkristian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:53:43 2015 UTC,"You said they should have build around limits similar to guns, which makes them unfit for building them into your bot as it would make it huge and/or weak. Then you made the comparison to radar receiver, which is always planted on the outside as it is a large non-critical unit. Did you not mean it should be placed on the outside? That was the only logical conclusion I could take from it.   In fact you are specifically saying that they should either make you weaker or be on the outside. That completely defeats the purpose of a self healer. A self healer can't heal a dead bit, weak bots are mostly dead bots. Self healers are pointless if you have to place them outside, as they'll be the first things to go.   Was that not what you meant?   What would work was make the pilot a self healer with reduced CPU capacity (say 100 less.)"

Robocraft,3cg2ld,hrkristian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:18:53 2015 UTC,"A rail walker is one of few bot types who would be almost unaffected by your ""receiver-esque"" healing cube, they have the most* control over where they get shot, and could just place it accordingly.      For everyone else, who actually get shot randomly and often a lot, it'd be stupid at best, ridiculous at worst and you would be better off using the CPU on blocks.

Robocraft,3cg2ld,Tk_Fury,2,Wed Jul 8 10:10:42 2015 UTC,...and make weapon modules build-able parts like jammers and scanners.  If they are destroyed weapons would revert to default. Then FJ could work in different types of weapons based off of the normal 4.    The modules would likely favors larger builds that have room to accommodate them while also lowering their total cube count. This would add variety and slim down gunbeds. Also drones and balls would have to sacrifice their size and mobility if they wanted weapon modules.

IF they were defensive juggernaughts games would be miserably long.   For what I lack in defense I make up in speed and playstyle. I play a tiny medic pill drone that cling's to rocks, and hides in any nook or cranny it can find. If they get shot off I scuttle off to base for heals if I'm given the chance and that's the benefit of a speedy medic build.   I'm honestly against the idea of a medic that can self heal in a game of random chance. We've seen games with four medics paired against teams without any medic's whatsoever.   They need a system for keeping the medic player count evenly spread out more then anything else."

Robocraft,3civly,DEEGOBOOSTER,4,Wed Jul 8 06:49:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly plasmas are one of the best weapons for players starting to get used to the game, they're good for disabling enemy bots before they can even attack you, allowing you to score a lot of points with one well placed shot. They do get overwhelmed pretty easily though, but with a fast enough bot you can limit the chances of that happening pretty easily. They're the second best weapon for attacking from far away (first being rails of course) and in my opinion the best flying design for a robot is the plasma bomber because it can use its weapon splash to hit multiple targets from above."
Robocraft,3civly,RaptorX7,3,Wed Jul 8 08:23:53 2015 UTC,"I love plasmas, because if you can hit a bot in the right spot, they are done for, also very good at immobilising units."
Robocraft,3civly,__DK1__,3,Wed Jul 8 10:30:00 2015 UTC,"I think you should mention redundancy and spacing issues. SMG benefits from redundancies even those greater that 8. Plasmas and Nanos only add redundancy as spares in head-on fights so they can keep on their job rather than retreating if some get shot. Rails stick to the maximum 6 or below as your bot size permits due to their current space hungry design. Tesla slap as more as you can for more burst damage.  Just my general observations though.  And as everyone said, plasmas have been the goto weapon for a long long time. Reliable. It's like picking up a shotgun in a resident evil game."
Robocraft,3civly,InfiniteSynapse,3,Wed Jul 8 11:01:43 2015 UTC,"In order to know which weapon you should choose, you should play with all of them.

The ""best weapon"" is the one you are more comfortable with and/or the one that gives you the most joy to play with. From my point of view, plasma was the worst of all weapons, because i couldn't hit crap with it. Yet now i'm reasonably comfortable and happy using it. Although for some reason, i still have more issues hitting stationary target than moving ones."
Robocraft,3civly,Tezorian,2,Wed Jul 8 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"Here's some additional tidbits...  The top ""4"" standard classes and their ""roles"", are -    SMG Tank. Treads + Lots of blocks, very little shielding, lots of guns. (Also called gunbeds).. Can take a serious beating and survive. Benefit the most from healing. Slow and cumbersome front-line attackers. Best at taking towers and pushing the game forward.  Plasma bomber/thruster stick/plasma heli - Fast, flying, maneuverable, high burst damage. Usually shielded with minimal armor to stay light and fast (unless they are choppers, in which case they are usually more armored and less shielded). They are there for map control. ""Middle fusion tower is under attack"" should mean you're the first responder. Quickly fly over, spot who you can, drop plasma on them, hope they get disabled, and hope your team responds. When on the offensive, you corral the enemy team and spawn kill/disable them while SMG's take the Reactor.  Rail Walkers (sometimes hybrid fliers) - Slow, long range, weak up close, but dominant at long range. Usually heavily shielded and with minimal armor. Stay near your base or above/around a friendly tower and defend. Focus mainly on taking down fliers until someone approaches your base/tower, spot them, and disable/destroy them. If enemies come in a large group, fall back, call for help, and regroup with your team.  Medic Hover - Somewhat fast, maneuverable, and unfettered by obstacles so they can get back to the front line much easier. Usually heavily shielded, but sometimes uses armor to tank damage. Your job is to find a suitable tank and hide behind them. Press Right click to ""auto-heal"", or left click to target heal. You're the support - try to survive and heal as much as possible, assist in taking towers, and stick with your team. Do not go off on your own, as you die 1v1 to almost anything except another healer.   Some ""less than standard"" but very viable roles/classes  SMG Hover -> Lighter, Faster, shielded.. Acts as a good flanker/backdoor tower capper. Good in 1v1 fights, but not as easy to keep alive through healing, as they generally favor electro-plate shielding over lots of armor blocks. Difficult for plasma bombers to deal with, countered hard by medic+SMG Tank, and countered at long range by rails but dominates rails up close. Should always have 1-2 Radar jammers, and at least 1 radar helps. You want to avoid enemies unless you have an advantage. Backdoor towers, and flank large groups of enemies and prioritize taking out their back line medics/rails. If you take down their medic and die instantly after, you've done your job.  SMG Flier (Interceptor) - Light, fast, armed with SMGs, flying, and usually shielded on the bottom so they can absorb damage from ground units while focusing their attack on fellow fliers. These guys are the hard counter to choppers/plasma bombers, as they can follow them in the sky and get up close and personal, where SMG's chew through shielding. Bad at capping towers and map control, usually pretty squishy, and not very good at engaging ground units, but if properly supported and intelligently played (focus on keeping the skies clear!), can absolutely shut down the enemy air.  A word on choppers, cruisers, and teslas..  Teslas are not USUALLY someones primary weapon.. But many medics, plasmas, and some rails will throw them on their bot. For medics this serves as an offensive tool, if it's 2v2, SMG+medic vs SMG+Medic, the Teslas may turn the tide.  Choppers can be armed with anything.. Rails usually sit above base bubble, snipe people, then fall back into the bubble to heal if they get shot down. Choppers in general are usually tanky, and faster than (most) ground units while being slightly slower than other air units. Plasmas act like tankier versions of plasma bombers. Medics act as faster Hover Medics, but with the downside of being in the sky and thus easier to shoot down. SMG choppers tend to play similar to SMG Hovers.. Great at capping towers and backdooring, and excelling in 1v1 combat while losing against larger groups.  Cruisers are the middle ground between hovers and tanks.. They're technically faster than hovers, and squishier than tanks, while lacking the map access of both tanks and hovers. More stable than hovers, less stable than tanks. They're basically the ""middle ground"". They can be outfitted with anything. Plasma Cruisers use hit and run tactics better than plasma tanks. SMG Cruisers perform much like SMG hovers, with the inherent advantages/disadvantages I mentioned above.   Personally, I went to hovers and never looked back to cruisers, as I simply got sick of getting stuck on map features or sliding endlessly on ice. That said, my SMG cruiser pumped out some decent DPS and would often (literally) run circles around most other vehicles.   Hope this helps."

Robocraft,3cevrq,wizardcourt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:13:02 2015 UTC,"kinda was though, now that people adapted to new meta, its quite harder for a rail to kill anything(or even cripple), especially the 1000 cube behemoths, or the heavily electroplated(with the small plates like t3/t4/t5).  anyone saying rail is strong, is ignoring the fact that rail damage capacity depends on how well your opponent built his bot, a smg or a plasma can still wreck a well built robot without a lot of difference(as long you're good at it), but to a rail its the difference between crippling an enemy in a few shots(or even killing) and barely doing anything at all."
Robocraft,3cevrq,Auxaghon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:59:11 2015 UTC,I think they did this well. Basically both rails and plasma bombers get a buff while 1000 cube SMG monster tanks don't.

Robocraft,3cevrq,Khoakuma,8,Tue Jul 7 14:10:07 2015 UTC,"another rail raw damage buff? at this point I would just rather SMGs get nerfed (like having actual range limit, no more accuracy nerf plz) than just make other weapons 1 shotting everything.  Or maybe, y'know, buff ground speed as nearly everyone playing the game have been asking for. this address none of the current  balance concern. It's not SMG vs other weapons, it's light vs tanky. If anything else this exacerbate the problem. Now unless you're a gunbed/ heavy armor variance of other types (hover, bomber, chopter etc.), railgunners will murder you (as if this was not the case before). But then again, talking completely out of my ass here, as I haven't even played a game with the changes yet. We will see. In other news mega plasma inches ever closer to being half as good as mega SMG. Plasma gain minor damage buff at t10 but bigger in other tiers, looks neat."

Robocraft,3cevrq,The_5kull,5,Tue Jul 7 11:14:11 2015 UTC,This is only to make your score better comparable with the scores of the players from the losing team. The multiplier still applies afterwards when the RP gain is calculated.
Robocraft,3cevrq,Khoakuma,3,Tue Jul 7 11:18:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly, when you're on a losing team and you've carried the squad, now it's much more comparable.  You can see how well you've done or how badly you've done being carried on a winning Team."
Robocraft,3cevrq,The_5kull,5,Tue Jul 7 11:22:41 2015 UTC,"take it easy.  Just because someone on the losing team have lower score does not mean he was a complete shitter who got carried hard (medics comes to mind).  Remember the current scoring system still mostly favor offensive action, ie kills and CPU destroyed, which are not complete indicators of performance."
Robocraft,3cevrq,The_5kull,2,Tue Jul 7 11:28:44 2015 UTC,You're right. Healing should be more rewarding. As well as capturing objectives. Cause in the end the team with the most objectives wins most likely. This would also ballance the score difference from railgunners that get a shitload of destroyed cpu compared to someone who captured 10 towers.
Robocraft,3cevrq,Juvar23,3,Tue Jul 7 11:33:07 2015 UTC,"There is so much reward for destroying Protonium.  I regularly come top 3 on a winning team and all I do is cap towers.  People call me out for hacking, really there should be a column for Protonium destroyed, give it greater visibility that it's a viable way to gain RP."
Robocraft,3cevrq,The_5kull,4,Tue Jul 7 11:50:44 2015 UTC,Beeing able to see who destroyed how much Protonium would be great. As it is an essential part of the whole gameplay.

Robocraft,3cevrq,boybrushedplad,2,Tue Jul 7 11:21:56 2015 UTC,"I think its better like this. If you're in a bad team and carrying then you should be rewarded for that. Also the bad players of the winning team are ranked down. The drawback is, that teamplay plays a minor role in this calculations. Only the individual score counts for you."
Robocraft,3cevrq,Juvar23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:28:06 2015 UTC,"But at this point, there is no reward for carrying at all. It's just the aesthetic score board, but you still get half the RP than all winners, and once rank comes along you still won't rank up no matter how well you carried the team.  There should be rewards (or less punishment) for losers that did exceedingly well. But there isn't. Just not showing the x2 bonus on the score board doesn't change the fact it's applied to RP, you literally gain nothing from that multiplier not showing on the board."
Robocraft,3cevrq,boybrushedplad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:43:09 2015 UTC,"You will rank up if you carry on the losing team.   Top scorers go up, top of the bottom keep rank, bottom of the score board goes down."

Robocraft,3cevrq,Juvar23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:44:51 2015 UTC,"Oh i read that but misunderstood.  So not top scorers rank up, but actually winners rank up unless afk, top scoring losers hold rank and bottom scoring losers rank down.  It seems completely reasonable not to rank up if your team lost though, but maybe just hold rank.  It's not about having a high ELO, really, it's about having good match making.     Just one game won't be a good deciding factor but if you are losing game after game but doing well each time, you probably shouldn't be fighting even more skilled enemies."
Robocraft,3cevrq,Khoakuma,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:52:27 2015 UTC,"i agree that there should be a bonus for the winning team to encourage teamplay and discourage ksing etc., but doubling was too much. You gotta have been a really shitty player to not rank up if you were on thee winning team. Something like 25% maybe better.  Or maybe even a flat score bonus, which matter much more in a short game than in a long game."
Robocraft,3cevrq,Juvar23,2,Tue Jul 7 11:25:46 2015 UTC,Yeah exactly. I've always been saying a x1.5 multiplier would be great.
Robocraft,3cevrq,The_5kull,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:32:26 2015 UTC,The double effect is kept for RP received as far as I understand.
Robocraft,3cevrq,Juvar23,2,Tue Jul 7 11:27:18 2015 UTC,"i know, the scoring im talking about relates to future ranking purpose only. The RP gain stays the same (score and RP gain use the same formula btw, your score is exactly how much you gain in RP before premium/daily double bonus)"
Robocraft,3cevrq,The_5kull,3,Tue Jul 7 11:30:48 2015 UTC,"Tbf, I think that reducing the RP multiplier for winners would also be a good idea. Probably reduces the problem of leavers as well."
Robocraft,3cevrq,Jpgar_Pootis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:34:06 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good idea. Gaining twice as much as the loosing team after a nice game with well ballanced teams is realy frustrating for the others.

What kind of logic is that from a competitive point of view? Didn't we get enough one-shots as railers already?  Here's an idea, look at my plasma score when i first started playing with it and adjust the damage to make it seem like i actually was excellent back then. This buff is just one BIG HUMONGOUS fail.  I actually, close to completely, stopped playing rail, because of all the one-shots i kept getting. Except for the 2x and random game here and there. There hardly was any challenge in playing it.

Robocraft,3cevrq,Phlegm_Farmer,2,Tue Jul 7 12:39:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's nice said and all but the difference between those games and robocraft is that how long you last is dependent on how well you build. Being able to pump out 6 kills with 6 shots is a horrible thing, there's no recourse, no retaliation and you can never see your opponent. And those kinds of maps are very linear in places, there are really only a few places where snipers work best. Here, the fog is so bad, the maps are so open, and the size is so small, rails have a field day. Pre meta updates, I got into T10 with a railer. The damage might have been underwhelming, but I was still able to pump out 3 kills a game by knowing where to shoot. Prime example by /u/flubbel rails rock if you know here to shoot"

Maybe they'll remove the restriction in the next majot launch when megabots will be able to join normal battles, although so far we don't even know how the new megabots will work in normal battles, so there's that. If they don't plan to do any major overhauls to the megabot system, then I think it's fair to allow them to platoon up  with normal bots."

Maybe healers might get a problem ending high in score in a winners game since there is not so much too heal for example.  Weapon balance becomes more important that way, if one weapon gets more score easily it will be used to rank up.  If only the bad half of the loosing team gets punished that seems like a way to go, but can we always determine the bad players of the loosing team by that?  Do we know what happens with disconnecter in the loosing team? When they loose rank i pity those with a honest disco, if they are stable people will use this too flee judgement.

Also, I read somewhere that everyone on the winning team will rank up, the top half of the losing team will stay the same and the bottom half will go down. Wont't this mean that there will always be more players gaining ELO than there are losing ELO? For some reason that doesn't make sense to me."

Robocraft,3chsdm,Psatch,2,Wed Jul 8 00:36:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it kinda sucks. A longer game usually means a better ranking. Although the score only counts your last 30 matches so another thing is you could of had a really good match that was bumped out by the current match which can also lead a loss in score.  I really want a better scoring system but I have doubts with the ELO ranking system FreeJam wants to put in place. In fact at this point it's hardly an ELO system, similar design but very different. They want to make it so winning or losing is the biggest factor of a person ranking up or down. Which in turn can have the best player in the match not rank up because his team didn't win. Hardly a score showing personal skill yet they say it accurately portrays a players skill when the score will revolve mostly around the team.   Personally I predict the scoring system will bounce players far more than a traditional ELO score."

Robocraft,3cgxwn,Tezorian,5,Tue Jul 7 21:20:16 2015 UTC,"It was a T9 match. What I saw is that the bots that give the most damage, and did the most kill per bot was SMGs, not railguns. I only had a good death/kill ratio by luck. On other plays I usually get many more deaths, thanks to plasma flying balls. The fact is that a railgun bot are screwed at near combat or if you are rushed by enemy, because you can't fire your weapons when are reloading and are quickly disabled by a SMG bot, even with the base shield healing factor.  Also, in this match, I saw that even with the buff, I didn't get many instakill of bots. It's on function of how well it's made a enemy bot. I usually need 2 or 3 shoots to kill a bot (I usually try to disable it more that kill it), and I found that one of the enemy railguners was pretty hard to kill, needing to do like 9 shots to kill it (Ok, I didn't have a clean shoot to his seat, as was hiding behind a tower)  I don't say that the railguns need to be buffed or nerfed more. I only say that people should stop to crying about it and try to make more hard bots.  My gameplay as railguner focus more on trying to disable enemy bots that trying to kill it, and focusing on healers, flyers and railguners. It's more funny to see an plasma helicopter  falling as a rock, that trying to kill it when you see that have too many electroplates to do a easy kill before shoot to you."

I don't even mind if damage is reduced - but I'm not going to wait forever for a reload.

I was playing on the impact crater map and i saw the enemy team had 3 bombers, rather than wait around for them to try and snipe the medics, then blast them i though ""Why don't i just fly to the enemy base and back-cap so the bombers will come to me?"".  So that's what i did and sure enough this ball shaped bomber (Different ep's from clulys design though) flys in and i pop him like a balloon.  Sadly this balloon had an escape chair inside, but unlike most escape chairs he still had a single plasma left.  He then proceeded to fly around everywhere nailing me with every shot (because plasma doesn't take any accuracy penalty from moving) while i found it litterally impossible to hit him with rail.  Not only that but my team failed so basically i just had to sit there trying to hit this guy and failing while he cheesed all my health away..."

Robocraft,3cd0dx,billiarddaddy,3,Mon Jul 6 23:20:54 2015 UTC,"There's definitely something to this.  We had a Russian opponent in one match that was exploiting this.  We asked him to stop(else we'd report him), and he responded in chat that ""he was just trying to use the mechanic he had found"" or something like that.  His English wasn't great.  He actually stopped doing it and left the match.  A bunch of people still reported him... Heh."
Robocraft,3cd0dx,Protoform-X,2,Mon Jul 6 23:50:33 2015 UTC,"This is definitely starting to seem more like an actual hack rather than a random glitch at this point. I was in a battle against an SMG walker today on one of the ice maps where he would seemingly just clip through the ground at will and shoot at our team and reactor from the layer of ice below the terrain. He did this for most of the game before eventually disconnecting.  Edit: Yes, he was doing this all over the map, even dropping straight down through flat ground to avoid my rail shots."
Robocraft,3cd0dx,atocci,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:11:41 2015 UTC,that's a glitch
Robocraft,3cd0dx,ihatehappyendings,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:16:06 2015 UTC,"Whenever it happens on ice maps, it's a glitch. Whenever it happens on mars maps, it probably isn't. If this screenshot was on the ice map, I'd believe it was a glitch and not an exploit. Before you were able to hop into practice after quickly leaving battle queue, then get put into the practice map and see a bunch of other bots flying around on what is a different map to them."
Robocraft,3cd0dx,jkelleyrtp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:07:53 2015 UTC,"It's weird that you separate ""glitch"" and ""exploit"" that way in your wording.  It doesn't matter whether it's intentional, if you keep playing and using it to your advantage, you can and should be banned for it."
Robocraft,3cd0dx,Desirsar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:18:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess. It's never really happened to me, maybe once or twice on gliese lake I try to park on the glaciers and get stuck in the snow pile. Unless there's a mod in the game who tells the guy to get out and stop fighting from inside there because it's really an exploit, there's not much we can do. And even then, it could be someone like me who accidentally falls in and says ""oh sweet, I found a neat trick"", not knowing it's an exploit."
Robocraft,3cd0dx,jkelleyrtp,0,Wed Jul 8 13:37:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know of the practice map glitch (I've never tried it myself though), but he was definitely interacting with the terrain of the ice map, typically only when it was convenient to himself though. For example, he would jump up from the ice layer below onto the normal ground and shoot only to drop back down when we began to return fire and then continue to shoot us from under the map. It seemed more or less like he was choosing exactly when to pass through parts of the map, making it look a bit less like a bug a more like something being done intentionally. I don't know though, it seems like something EAC would prevent."
Robocraft,3cd0dx,atocci,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"Sounds a lot like those videos in TF2 where people find places to put Sentries outside the map's borders and endlessly annoy players who can't retaliate... in a video it's funny, and will alert the Devs to patch it, but... just exploiting it in game sounds like a dick move."

In T10, we can assume that anything that isn't T9 and colored has actual T10 blocks stats, so guessing which armor someone is using shouldn't be that big of a deal anymore. That being said, I'd like to see them without any more circuitry/detail, although I think that would also be really cool on blocks. The pastel mutes look really cool right now and I'd like to see the other colored variants."

Robocraft,3cciwn,Never-Wolf,13,Mon Jul 6 21:09:12 2015 UTC,Racing along. Blasting away at your enemy as you move along.  The lead guy getting his tail trashed as he struggled to shoot backwards and move forward.  1st place lead looses all his mobility from all the damage. Presses the reset key and the 3 second count down begins. His pilot gets magnetizes out of his crippled wreck as a fresh bot phases into reality surrounded in mysterious electrical warping. The seat affixes and he re-enters the race the race! (albeit not in first place any more)  Like road rash. But with robocraft.

Robocraft,3cbq5e,TheAero1221,2,Tue Jul 7 07:44:38 2015 UTC,Nice! Those eagle feathers look great. Where does one get those thrusters though? I've only gotten to T9 so far.

Robocraft,3cdaee,Namell,3,Tue Jul 7 00:41:21 2015 UTC,You can't. You can use the tier gauge to roughly estimate your robot ranking but there is no easy way to see the exact figures for RR and mass. Although this feature could be coming in the next update.
Robocraft,3cdaee,Uexo,4,Tue Jul 7 01:35:01 2015 UTC,I did little googling and year ago people were asking for mass of robot and nothing has been done.  This kind of stuff is really making me fast lose faith in the game. It seems developer is using too much effort for inventing fancy new transport methods that work near identical and too little time fixing basic problems in game and lack of basic information.
Robocraft,3cdaee,jkelleyrtp,2,Tue Jul 7 02:11:11 2015 UTC,"Well you can strip your bot of all functional cubes and and multiply the weight of each cube by the number of cubes (they tell you that). Agreed the information needs a lot of work but isn't really a reason to quit a game over. If you need a light build, use prisms."
Robocraft,3cdaee,Juvar23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:44:55 2015 UTC,And now I found out there is CPU cap for each tier. As far as I  know such cap is not mentioned anywhere in game. You just suddenly see tier bar jump a lot and no where it tells why it goes up. I chanced to youtube video that happened to explain it or I would have thought there is cap of amount of shielding you can have.  This stuff really makes game infuriating and sure way to drive new people away.
Robocraft,3cdaee,NorbiPeti,2,Tue Jul 7 06:03:51 2015 UTC,"Yep, there needs to be more explanations in game!"
Robocraft,3cdaee,boybrushedplad,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:02:45 2015 UTC,These things are because these are new stuff. I would say that the game is in alpha but I can agree with that FreeJam has little priorization problems...
Robocraft,3cdaee,fragment059,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:14:48 2015 UTC,"The devs have said they plan to implement a much better garage with all of these basic functions.  There are just other things on the development list ahead of that, it seems.  But the next update for august  is supposed to be the biggest update by far.  3x bigger than any other update.   So who knows, maybe they will add it this time.   Just remember the game is under development and it's state at any one time doesn't really say a lot about what the finished product will be.   Tldr give it time."
Robocraft,3cdaee,Juvar23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:26:24 2015 UTC,"'fancy new transport methods that work near identical' The different movement types are actually vastly different and each have their own advantages/disadvantages. Sure, they do need to improve the learning curve, but they are working on tutorials. The extra content on the other hand is what keeps designs fresh and limits the need for everyone to run a cookie cutter build, there are still builds that fit the meta but there is enough variation for it to count."

Robocraft,3ca7co,Hockey868,2,Mon Jul 6 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's hidden way, way below the middle one. There's at least 10 layers of armor from the top, 12 from the sides and a fuckton at the front.  Built the seat in a pod too so that it breaks away if things get nasty. If only I can use thrusters to make it a proper escape pod...  Edit: Here's a picture I managed to get of it; the seat's location is highlighted in red blocks. Also took away some blocks to expose it, so it's not as vunurable as you'd think it is ;D"

Robocraft,3ccpep,Pamela4,7,Mon Jul 6 21:58:03 2015 UTC,"The level you are talking about is the ""Overclock"" level.   It increases damage on all weapons, heal rate on nanos Increases top speed of wheels, tracks, arifoils and rudders Increases lift of foils and rudders Increases thrust of thrusters Increases shield value of EPs Increases the respawn timer!   One thing that is completely unaffected by the OC is your armor cubes, which is part of the reason why in the endgame, bots die rather quickly."

I retreat, some other SMG takes over, I go back to the front so the SMG can go back for heals, and so on. Took a while, but definitely not as OP as you would think.  Within the shield however, I would not want to face that^"
Robocraft,3cazrg,mitit1001,2,Mon Jul 6 21:58:14 2015 UTC,I don't see any problem with it as long as the team stays with him at the base it won't matter. This allows him to focus on armor and weapons rather than mobility which could make him have potential for ultimate tankyness.
Robocraft,3cazrg,AnkleSlicer69,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:22:01 2015 UTC,First time I saw it it kind of pissed me off. Then we won the match by a landslide. I then got paired with him again and won again by a landslide.  Then got paired against him and it was a full time driven stalemate as we continually poked in to hit him (and his four medics) and then back out to heal.  It works quite well given they can focus on guns/T10 armor without having to even leave clearance off the ground. Their pilot seat gets buried away. Just don't expect quick games.

Robocraft,3cbr47,ColaBear92,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:54:05 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're in T10, you'll have to stick to TX-1 blocks. T10 Helium is very CPU-intense in the amounts required to lift T10 armor blocks, and increasing the total mass will also require more thrusters for the same speed. So, summed up, you'll have to stick with something fairly small with only* TX-1 cubes.  *: T10 blocks in small amounts are viable to balance out your craft, for example towards the bottom of a bot to prevent it flipping at high speeds."

I made a T8 drone, but due to all of the CPU helium requires you have a I don't have much to put on the drone. This excludes amounts of thrusters I can put on it, so it goes slow up to 100 mph.  The drone works, I am just bummed out that the CPU limits kinda ruins helium builds.

Robocraft,3c9m9z,DumberMonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:43:40 2015 UTC,I think the problem is the total weight divided by the number of wheels.  I use all steering because it turns tighter.  but I get around just fine I think because I have more wheels.  I can't have 4600 because of the cpu of the 9 guns and 8 wheels so can't test it with that many blocks.

Robocraft,3cbc4l,Psatch,-3,Mon Jul 6 18:55:40 2015 UTC,"A note to builders: Put your left/right wings on the same T0 block so that when one wing is shot off by a railer, the opposite wing is also knocked off. Also, due to damage propagation, the opposite wing will absorb lots of the rest of the rail shot (11370 HP + 15% resistivity for each aerofoil, 34240 damage from rail)"
Robocraft,3cbc4l,ThunderLuigi,2,Mon Jul 6 22:49:58 2015 UTC,"As nice as what you suggest seems, I do not think it is sound advice. Instead, I would triforce the plane as best as possible to make damage have to go through as many armor cubes as possible before hitting important parts (especially wings! Don't let those get destroyed!). Each wing holds a certain amount of weight. If a wing gets destroyed, there is no longer a wing there to hold the weight of the plane that the wing was comfortably responsible for. The reason planes lose balance is because the wing that gets destroyed can no longer hold its weight, and the remaining wings have a difficult time holding the remaining weight up. Instead of destroying a pair of wings by placing the pair on a shared block like you suggest, damage should be propagated to the armor cubes that the destroyed wing was responsible for. What this ultimately does is destroy that weight, meaning the surviving wings do not have to compensate for the weight which leads to retained control.  Even taking a step back and looking at that concept it you might see my point. You invest so much CPU into those wings, just to have both get destroyed by a single rail shot? It's like having a plane that's 1511 CPU go for 1511 CPU to 1452, which is a decrease in about 5 levels all because of one shot! I can understand your point about wings being able to sponge damage, but I would rather retain control and possibly live to fly away than lose control and live to crash into a mountain."

Robocraft,3cbc4l,LittleGitten,2,Mon Jul 6 20:07:41 2015 UTC,"Flyers are definitely viable in T10 -- more viable then in any other tier, in fact! Everyone in T10 has T10-grade armor and T10 grade weapons. This means that the ratio of armor/damage is very high. In lower tiers, players often play with T-1 armor and T= weapons, which makes the ratio of armor/damage low (tougher for flyers!). Because the armor/weapon ratio is highest in T10, it means that flyers can actually play very well since avoiding damage is ESPECIALLY important for flyers. Yes, MSMGs exist which can lower the armor/damage ratio, but it's worth noting that bots that use MSMGs are super fragile which means you can often take out a huge chunk of the bot with a volley of plasma.   Yes, thrustersticks can be annoying but they don't have to hinder you so much. They often have little health so a railgunner on your team can take them out.

Robocraft,3cbc4l,Anormalcat,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:56:31 2015 UTC,the problem is that because the game only allows one weapon type you end up with counters.  rock paper scissors.  and matchmaking LOVES to give your team all scissors and the enemy all rocks  the bomber vs air SMG is the second worst matching of the game.  the worst is nano vs bombers :P  the game needs better detection to balance teams.  getting these matchups is pretty dumb and makes the game shitty to play.  here you get two extra ground plasma tanks and the enemy gets two medics.  lol  you could have just put ONE OF EACH on the teams... fucking dumb

The first model is never going to be perfect (unless you have lots of experience), and you're just going to have to keep building. Just remember that your center of lift, thrust, and mass has to be around the same point, or that plane isn't going anywhere.  As for playing with a plane, you are not a front liner, you are a sabotager, get behind the enemy and take them by surprise. You have to duck and weave around terrain to not get sniped down instantly. Go for easy targets, like distracted rails or ground plasmas, and hit-and-run with smgs."
Robocraft,3c9fky,malum-panem,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:39:21 2015 UTC,I posted some pictures of my plane below. I feel like it flies extremely well so far.  The tips on the strategy actually did help a bit on the last round I played. Keeping back a bit and waiting to dive in. I'm also thinking my plane is more well designed for a fighter and maybe I should load SMGs on it to counter the other planes.
Robocraft,3c9fky,Onceuponaban,2,Mon Jul 6 05:23:59 2015 UTC,"Basically, as a plane, you have to choose between being agile and being tanky and you'll have to adjust your play style accordingly. You can perfectly make a behemoth that will nuke the entire enemy team before taking enough damage to fall out of the skies, as shown by Lathrix, but those planes are not very agile.  If you decide to make a smaller plane, exploit the terrain to your advantage. Fly close to the ground on the edge of the map, sweep in, wreck the enemy, and disappear as fast as possible before the rail is locked on you, even more so at tier 4 where people play more rail bots than usual due to it being first unlocked at that tier."
Robocraft,3c9fky,boybrushedplad,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:08:12 2015 UTC,"The problem with making an interceptor is your only good targets are plasma bombers.

Robocraft,3c9fky,mitit1001,2,Mon Jul 6 07:08:51 2015 UTC,"Do what malum-panem said.  As for the more guns question, if you have 6 plasmas on your plane, that should be ok, since you don't want to 1v1 anything. If you have space and CPU,sure you can add more.  To make a stable plane, add at least 2 wings and 3 rudders. Any less gives you not complete maneuverability. If you show us a pic of your plane, we might be able to suggest more specific things. In general, wings give you more stability, rudders give you more maneuverability. For your first plane (T4) you won't be getting too much of either, but it is a good time to learn.  If you don't want to do that much of the ducking away, build a copter. Those things are alot harder to shoot down."

I have two T4 wings up front along with 2 T4 Rudders laying down to help (Haven't tested without them, it might do just as well). Towards the back I have 4 T4 engines lined up. Then a tail with 4 rudders (2 horizontal and 2 vertical). Lastly 1 final T4 Engine for further control. To increase my manuevarabilty I also placed two T3 engines just bellow the cockpit facing up.

I tend to be able to out maneuver other planes, I reach top speed quickly, and can control it on a dime. I haven't gotten too great at the plasmas while moving, I am decent on a tank. I have been testing between plasmas, SMG, and sniper but they all have their ups and downs on the plane.  Let me know what you guys think."
Robocraft,3c9fky,sakhabeg,2,Mon Jul 6 05:21:46 2015 UTC,"I see what your problem is. Not enough armor layers. The pilot sits on the bottom layer of armor, which as a plane is where you'll get shot most of the time. Try making a bigger plane with higher tier armor (at least on the key points, like weapon mounts, pilot seat mount...) , more than two layers of armor and put more thrusters to compensate. You'll want at least one layer of armor below the one where your pilot is placed.  You should also see Robocraft Garage, a community run website where you can browse hundreds of design to draw inspiration from. I have published my own T6 plane there, which I feel is somewhat successful."

Robocraft,3c9fky,Cleru_as_Kylar_Stern,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:46:41 2015 UTC,"Another idea, put your pilot seat more towards the middle. If you dive down onto an enemy, your nose is coming in first, so any SMG or plasma fire will mainly hit that. The closer your pilot is to the front, the faster you die diving onto an enemy.  Really nice plane though, looking good!"

You didn't quit, you did the most damage in the match, you got a respectable amount of kills, and you got around double the score of anyone else on your team.   It's a pity that none of that really matters if you lose though, because your RP gets gimped just for being on the losing side, which is absolutely bullshit IMO.

Robocraft,3c759f,Namell,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:26:05 2015 UTC,When I started out I used a rolling garage system:  A Tier 1 bot in garage slot 1. Then a T2 bot in garage 2. Then a T3 in garage 3. My First T4 bot was in garage 1 again. T5 in garage 2. T6 in garage 3... you see where this is going.  This way I had at least 2 tiers behind my top to revert to should I find myself failing hard.

Robocraft,3c78vm,KillaJoke,6,Sun Jul 5 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"while that much is true and I do agree with you , I also understand why some are upset over these changes. Sadly artbot's did take the grunt of the hit, and whilst not very combat effective they did bring about a smile...  But I feel that's more of the armor tier being tied to color's more then anything else.    And those that were looking for a one gun tiny design.  But in the end I feel like we are in the same place at the moment due to an imbalance of power between the advantages of movement type.   Light build's have a hell of a lot to work against at the moment and could use some help to maybe push for some more breathing room. And for some OT meant a bit of a variety of how many gun's you could have... And whilst OT and UT were unfair I can understand where they are coming from.  Right now there's an optimal number of guns, optimal build's for blockspam.... There's not much in the way for wiggle room at the moment.   You're not going to see a hover mudkip gliding across the map tearing people up, You wont see a tesla hover shaped like links sword ramming into you...  We need solutions to give artistic build's a chance to stand up against the rest. We need solutions to vary up the ideal number of guns and make  smaller less powerful build's atleast capable of accomplishing something... And I noticed something when it came to my plasma copter.  With two plasma's I could rip crystals a new one. With two guns I could still be effective through overclocking... And I want to possibly suggest that the number of guns you have ties into it somehow.  A bot with three gun's could get ahead on overclocks above a tank... But it'll eventually hit a limit and if that tank catches up it's going to loose that momentum... But it has a window of oppertunity atleast.   I don't agree with the reaction of outrage and angry review bombs, but I feel like their's some valid feedback buried underneath that. One of the appeals of robocraft was the ability to make something silly and take it into battle.   And perhaps one way to deal with lighter electroplate build's and players who wanna go more for less gun's more maneuverability and getting around should get a headstart in OC."
Robocraft,3c78vm,ExplosiveMachine,3,Sun Jul 5 16:23:55 2015 UTC,"if it's okay i'll correct you, plural never has an apostrophe before the s. ""gun's"" The gun doesn't own anything - it's ""guns"". ""plasma's"" The plasma doesn't own anything. The build doesn't own anything. An apostrophe is only used when implying possession (the gun's barrel was hot) and in possession in plural, such as ""the guys' night out"" (not guys's night out) or ""my parents' computer"". I don't want to be a grammar nazi, it's just that you used that every time, maybe English isn't your first language (as it isn't mine either), and you picked it up from the internet, or your phone really wants to correct you on everything."

In most games all-rounder classes are subpar at each role - but the SMG has no serious downsides, is the easiest for building redundant bots, and in combination with a tanky body it holds superiority in most matchups. Regarding most matchups - there are situations where other bot types are superior (rail/plasma walkers on canyon maps, fliers on maps with vertical mobility) - but since you don't choose the map you're going to, and the maps haven't been changed a lot for Battle mode, so you risk getting screwed over (say, try playing a ground plasma bot on the Crater map); the only design suited for everything? See point 1. Less weapon diversity - now you're just limited to current tier guns, and you better have 6+ of them - so all the bots will follow the same design pattern. Overtiering let us create bots with vastly different stats, which is now impossible. Seal clubbing - now in the single-gun-on-a-stick flavor! The seals go to you on their own! Enjoy a team of disfunctional allied bots, each game, every day.   I can list a lot more stuff...

Robocraft,3c4edz,X-wing9,6,Sat Jul 4 23:10:53 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about stationary rail flyers, instead of the hybrid walker-rudder types, then it has mostly to do with railgun mechanics.  Helium works nicely and provides good stability, but is a bit difficult to master and design due to the force of railgun shots. Rotors, however, provide remarkable stability when idling in the air. The aim offset caused by the bobbing effect is so negligible that shots are roughly 98% as precise as standing completely still, flickering just a little bit.  Railguns can keep some of their precision even if the user is moving. I actually managed to kill robots in close combat while skidding at high speeds in my walker sleds, and have even seen thruster sticks scoring railgun kills while flying! This is because the main aim throw-off for rails is MOUSE MOVEMENT, not robot movement. If you turn your aim as you steer/maneuver, the rails stay in place, keeping most of their accuracy intact. But if you franctically shake your mouse before shooting, their sluggish turn rate won't keep up, and your shots will suffer drastic offsets."

Robocraft,3c42ig,PianomanKY,2,Sat Jul 4 22:35:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the effort you put in this game Gottchar.  Sadly they already chosen a way to go, which is rather radical again. I hope it works out this time.   Removing the Techpoints alltogether and reducing choice might work and makes things simplier. I showed this game to a few players and all of them were confused about what RP, GC, TP, RR, Level + CPU all is about in the beginning. Reducing some of its complexity that does not so much serves a purpose might be a good move.  But it might be not as rewarding to the dug in gamer that wants to progress his way and not follow a path or wait for restriction to lift by itself with playing.  Your techtree would solve the same problems with progression in a way as does removing it.  What I found more interesting and something that FJ, even now after they already chose a way, could give a look, is your RP reward idea.  Reducing the cost for low tier blocks might be better than giving that insane amount of RP compared to lower tiers. Tier rushing should really not get rewarded that much. On the other hand rushing wont be possible with the lvl based unlocks. Only premium players winning everytime will rush through the game more than others, but that sounds about right.  The only thing I suggested was increasing the techpoint tiers for weapons once again and not give out Tier+1 weapons that would be done within a short time but they rather move radical than tweaking it a bit first."
Robocraft,3c42ig,boborossa,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:11:21 2015 UTC,"This idea + the unlockables per level range, could work our really well. As this is currently a ""quick"" idea, numbers can be changed easily. You could for instance set a different discount for each type, like Armor/weapon/Movement/EP. For instance adjust the numbers, so it would be more beneficial to unlock armor before your weapon or movement. It's the tweaking of the system that will take the most time. Kind of like how you build a good bot. Once you have the frame and the parts in place, you test it and see what could be improved.   The biggest bonus of this idea is that it makes it worth NOT to rush."

Bringing higher tier stuff into lower tiers was a problem for a while, as you could use really high tier guns in those mini bots you saw, and just destroy everyone trying to learn the game and progress.  This does have a side effect of the new gun rushing, where people tier up very quickly by adding the next tier of a single gun to their bot. With this, you can hit T10 in several hours. The next patch is being worked on to fix this."

Robocraft,3c5l01,auriem,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:43:06 2015 UTC,It was a common complaint of new players that it was unfair to play against much higher level players with access to weapons and a cube count they had no hope of matching.  It was a while ago while I was leveling up and not as predominant as it got later on but I remember being frustrated when facing someone with T+2 or +3 weapons. Without a sneak attack on just the right spot on their bit you had no chance going one on one.
Robocraft,3c5l01,VonGod,2,Sun Jul 5 14:07:15 2015 UTC,I feel experiences are different for everyone.  Seeing OT made me want to progress. I wanted to get those weapons.  I then got more in to the game to hone OTing.   My suggestion was to split Casual and Competitive to keep OT.
Robocraft,3c5l01,auriem,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:30:14 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way, playing against people with better weapons and armor made me want to level up too but you have to admit it wasn't a fair fight and FreeJam listened to their players in removing it.  Without OT fights are now more skill based instead of biased to players with more cpu."
Robocraft,3c5l01,VonGod,2,Sun Jul 5 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"I guess it can not be fair. But I didn't mind personally.  Still as I said, my solution would be to split Casual and Competitive. Competitive would keep OT and Casual would not."

Robocraft,3c2cxi,mitit1001,-1,Sat Jul 4 12:34:49 2015 UTC,"T10 cubes would make it tougher and therefore less of a troll build :(   Basically they introduced ""minimum armour class"" recently - you can't go into battle if your bot has less than T-1 armour class.   This ""bot"" should have armour class T1 and therefore not be allowed to enter T10 battles. However, glass cubes don't count towards armour class. It's a bug I'd say. Just showcasing."
Robocraft,3c2cxi,radyjko,2,Sat Jul 4 13:01:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, so thats it. But isnt it T-2? I have red/blue (T5/T6) armored bot in T7 and it is allowed to play. It wasnt when I had some hidden T4 cubes inside."
Robocraft,3c2cxi,Phlegm_Farmer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:26:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I said ""less than T-1"" :) you can play in T7 because the majority of your blocks is T6. However, if your whole bot was made out of glass, you could still play."

Robocraft,3c181u,VonGod,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:15:12 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking about how we could implement this outside of Robocraft. Because FJ is busy enough with the current gamemode and it would be a community thing already and... I like ""hacking"" Robocraft... xD Just... In the legal way, you know.  Anyways, I think it could be made with a separate program, maybe even a website, the problem would be with detecting players, winning and such. But I think even that could be covered with a program which checks for players in current battle (the game stores it for CurseVoice) and then search for them and ask them in a form of a poll that who won (because deciding that is almost impossible as I know), and then the central server would hold the galactic wins/loses.  Of course this would need trustworthy players but I don't know. Please reply with your ideas.  Edit: Or, we could ask FJ nicely to include a tiny WinnerTeam thing in that file... That would help a lot.  Edit2: Oh, I realized that we can't have custom made matches but whatever, I will keep this here."

Robocraft,3c0jdp,Flubbel,4,Fri Jul 3 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"So, assuming if you're level 100, would you automatically unlock everything currently?  I say ""currently"", only because this opens up the possibility of going beyond level 100. Guys... hope you're reading this...  Yes, maybe CPU won't increase after level 100 due to performance, but we could see the development of ""special unlocks"" to those committed players who continue to play and continue to level up pass level 100.  This opens up the ""unlimited level progression"" similar to an MMO's ""end game"". Just an idea...  Edit: Why? because if all future content/blocks is released at level 100 (T10)... what's the point in playing (apart from enjoyment and also destroying bots)? The gaps in leveling would also give Devs some time to bring out the next block or item at X level for players to reach after level 100 has been reached.  Edit 2 - maybe even a special block, similar to the Name Tag but would display your current level.... mostly used for intimidation as it shows you're an experienced player... cough cough or more so... bragging rights cough.... Perhaps unlocked every 100 levels?"
Robocraft,3c0jdp,ImAussielicious,7,Fri Jul 3 20:28:31 2015 UTC,"Huh. I'm not really sure how to feel about this. On one hand, it completely stops people from just rushing T10, and allows for a better sense of progression, which I very much like the sound of.  On the other hand, this solution does absolutely nothing to address the other changes people are taking issue with, those being no OT allowed/min. armour/cpu caps.  Is this all we get, or will there be more fixes to come?"
Robocraft,3c0jdp,HS_Rukodiora,2,Fri Jul 3 18:53:54 2015 UTC,These changes came to support the no OT armor/ cpu caps. and resolve one of the major issue's that came with the patch.  They want battle and classic mode to be even stevens battleground where skill is the deciding factor over tech or cpu that players of that tier don't have access to. players that want an anything goes match will be getting the pit.
Robocraft,3c0jdp,KillaJoke,-4,Fri Jul 3 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"If they didn't want tech to be a deciding factor, they should have just removed the tech tree and allowed everyone to buy blocks of every tier rather than breaking the entire game and alienating half the player-base. Of course, that would require even vague familiarity with how their own game plays, which it's been made very clear that FreeJam does not have in the slightest."
Robocraft,3c0jdp,fletcher720,5,Fri Jul 3 19:13:42 2015 UTC,"It was a band aid solution for the time being, and even back then they weren't to pressed with OT in a match that's five minutes long. a player could easily walk away from it, move on to the next match and be fine. A little bit of ""Man I hate OT! =/"" But it was something you could shake off after a very short investment of time.  But now they have a fully fledged gamemode that's time can vary greatly depending on the teams. Having your face bashed in by a bot with guns far above it's weightclass, and a nightmare on tread's with a block count and gun count greater then half your bloody team alone is a nightmare and doesn't teach you much in way of improving your own bot through looking at their building techniques. And it sure as hell wouldn't be fun fighting either of these in one long drawn out match where you could handle every other bot other then them just fine, and then loose all hope when they come your way.   They needed to keep the new player experience healthy during this awkward phase of transitioning.  They predicted that with the new gamemode they would see loss of the old playerbase and you can't really fault them if they do. Robocraft is changing... Some feeling for the better, and others for the worst.  But at the end of the day freejam has proven that it tries to listen. That it tries to answer community feedback. But the simple fact of the matter is they can't please everyone with these changes... And some will say they are being ignored. But really, it's picking a side of that feedback and choosing to roll with that side. When that other side feels ignored they immediately spew out ""WHY DOES FREEJAM LISTEN TO THE WHINERS!?!?""  They aren't whiners, they are simply giving their feedback such as you are now.   Freejam's danmed if they do, danmed if they don't. All they can do is pick a direction and work on the foundation of that direction.  Which is why they are talking about the removal of the Tech tree and reworking the part's system to be level based. To give you access to part's so you may enter a tier when you have an appropriate level of cpu to counter gun rushing.  Not only that, but give the player time to grind out the RP to improve their bot's as they level up and work towards the new tier rather then jumping up the ladder for the bigger paycheck whether or not your equipped for the job."
Robocraft,3c0jdp,KillaJoke,3,Fri Jul 3 19:42:49 2015 UTC,If done well it could be nice...
Robocraft,3c0jdp,Auxaghon,2,Fri Jul 3 18:16:11 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, Mark has decided that whenever you level up (or at certain levels) you will automatically be granted access to newer cubes. The tech tree no longer becomes a tech tree, but instead a progression list where you can simply see what you have and dont have access to. No more TP just grind for ever, coz you dont get to pick what part to unlock next >_>    EDIT: I just asked him if we get a choice in what we unlock..."
Robocraft,3c0jdp,SirDoober,4,Fri Jul 3 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"It also makes spending GC on Premium in order to tier/level up faster a very real thing, which can't be a coincidence."
Robocraft,3c0jdp,KillaJoke,2,Fri Jul 3 20:09:48 2015 UTC,"Mkay asking him some more questions on this.   So far it looks like this is an entire replacement for the tech tree. You'll unlock different parts in small clumps but ideally unlock something new every level.  Which is kinda my concern/ joy... I was kinda hope that there would be certain levels where you unlock a certain group of items.  armor first, small patch of levels for pflops, movement types to mess around with, pflop levels then maybe some EP's or something...  I'm not sure whether to be optimistic or worried. It might be a lil bit of a halt for playing a style you like to play. I'd just prefer the levels to not be preferential to certain bot types.   edit: fully detailed forum post on marks plans here http://robocraftgame.com/forums/topic/a-progression-problem-a-proposed-solution-you-have-helped/"

First one that FJ can finally stop thinking about slowing progress, second that TP is dumb and needs to grind in lower tiers (which is one of main reasons of this whole overtiering flame), third one that players can actually experiment without stupid amounts of grinding TP. Therefore T10 players can focus on competetive play and not waste bays for lower tier bots."
Robocraft,3c0jdp,Threedawg,6,Fri Jul 3 20:33:11 2015 UTC,I dont like how it takes a lot of choices and planning away from the players.
Robocraft,3c0jdp,zahkriisos,6,Fri Jul 3 18:56:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree.   I think that TP was a waste of time, especially at T10. electroplates and stuff immidietely allows you to really push for that level up and unleash your creative side sooner.   That being said, I don't like combining it with the rapid progression through the tiers, I think it should be toned down a bit."
Robocraft,3c0jdp,KillaJoke,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:51:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. I kind of compared it to picking character skills and abilities in other games (Skyrim as an example), which is something I liked.  This would also give you better goals imho: choose the path that you like to the top to get more CPU/RP/TP. And when you're done with reaching the top and get bored with it you can go back and start working on your other skills and abilities."
Robocraft,3c0jdp,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Fri Jul 3 19:18:39 2015 UTC,"Skyrim is a singleplayer game, some balance is required to keep the player engaged but how many player's could escape such pitfalls of using commands, mods, and even cheat's such as the ogma infinium. But all these methods came at the one players choice. Those decisions to use them would only ever effect one person. A game of choice, competition, and creativity... That a fair bit to balance in one game, and for robocraft balance isn't a choice, it's a necessity. It's a game that souly relies on the interaction of other players.   This is the stance on choice that they have taken :https://twitter.com/MarkDJammer/status/617069911190450176  And whilst rather grim, is fairly true. Give a person an inch and they take a mile, give a person a loop hole, and they will go deep down to see where the loophole ends.  For every users creativity that got hit with OT there were dozens of copy paste designs without effort, without style, without much heart put into it. They souly existed to farm players of a lower level.  In a game of choice and creativity that relies on interactions with one another ground rules need to exist, and the player's that have taken to ""pointing out"" the flaws of the new system by making one gun buggies and abusing it to the point it was a problem and got what they wanted. They pressured the dev's into a corner and made it into a problem they needed to fix quickly.   If there's a flaw in the system user's will abuse it for whatever reason they see fit. This of which has been proven many times before."

IE: once you have all tier 2 tech unlocked you don't earn more exp playing in tier 2, you need to go to tier 3 to earn more exp.     Can we get some kind of badge for having tens of thousands of tp?."
Robocraft,3c0jdp,cebeide,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:45:24 2015 UTC,"So I can imagine it being:  -Every 10 levels is a tier up  -First 4 are armor unlocks (block, prism/curve, etc.)  -5 unlocks weapons  -6 unlocks EP  -7 unlocks ground mobility  -8 unlocks air mobility  -9 unlocks special blocks  -0 unlocks the ""new"" thing for the tier instantly (like skis for t5)  So that by the time you get to 100, you have everything, and 100 unlocks mega parts.

The more kills you make with a Tier 3 SMG, the faster you unlock Tier 4.  Want Tier 8 curved prisms?  Better build a bot with more Tier 7 curved prisms.

Robocraft,3bzn7l,PM_QUIL0N_SPAM,2,Fri Jul 3 13:33:56 2015 UTC,Is there a reason we're not going dark? I'm curious about /r/robocraft's mod teams' stance on what is happening right now.   It's hard to disagree without jumping to conclusions since you've given us no information on the reasoning behind the choice. I'd rather not be that asshole that assumes the worst and jumps down your throat about it.
Robocraft,3bzn7l,munit_1,4,Fri Jul 3 16:22:49 2015 UTC,My personal opinion is it would annoy a lot of people not to be able to talk about Robocraft. Also I don't care.
Robocraft,3bzn7l,Sindoray,3,Fri Jul 3 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion is people get let go from companies all the time. And transitions are rough all the time.  Being small, our community is much more likely to die entirely with such a publicity stunt, while the actual impact to reddit would be negligible.  The big subreddits have made reddit aware of the communities opinions."

I can't say I would be disagreeable to /r/robocraft going dark, especially if you guys, as mods, share the frustrations and concerns of the others that have. After all, The Darkening(as it's being called in other subs) is more about mods and their grievances with the admins than it is about anything the users want.   All of that being said, I'm sympathetic to what's happening and would like to see, at the very least, a message of support for the other subs that have gone dark."

I want a place to talk about Robocraft, but I also want that place to have mods that are dedicated to making it the best place it can be. To that end, I'm behind whatever you guys decide is your best move here - whether that decision is to go dark, post a message of support, or whatever other options there might be."

LCD screens, which most people are using now, the whole thing is being backlit evenly, with the colors changing by changing the opacity of tiny colored windows. Actually, I think white might use (marginally) less power, because generally transparent is ""off"".  EDIT: I looked into it more, and some screens, dark does save energy, but for most, white is (a little bit) better. A nice summary and brief explanation here."

Robocraft,3bzn7l,MrEzekial,7,Fri Jul 3 13:18:23 2015 UTC,"The idea isnt that it really affected us, its how there is a lack of communication between the admins and the mods. The darkening of subreddits is to raise awareness.     What is an issue is how this problem for the admins was handled; whether or not it was an emergency for the admins, the IAmA mod team were not given warning, and weren't informed of the alternative contact location early enough     Im neither pro nor against going dark, I just wanted to clarify that it isnt about whether or not it affected this sub specifically.     The moderators of an increasing number of default subreddits have been making them private, in an attempt to draw the admins' attention to how they have been mismanaging the site with a substantive demonstrative act - since for many years, they've been trying to get the admins to listen normally with relatively little improvement.

Robocraft,3c1fo9,Vyngeance89,2,Sat Jul 4 00:25:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's because your rotors are so far back. The forward momentum is just your bot in a perpetual fall due to the lift from the rotors vs the front end falling.   EDIT: Just tested, can confirm. Front heavy bots move forwards when most of the lift is in the back. Conversely, rear heavy bots move backwards when lift is in the front. Just like IRL."
Robocraft,3c1fo9,TheBananaBaby300,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:48:21 2015 UTC,Yes this makes sense but the point is that this never happened before the last updates. I don't mind it since its logical but they should at least tell us about changes.

Robocraft,3c1fo9,gairlok,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:26:15 2015 UTC,"Well, most of my rotor bots are built forward heavy, so they should mimic your bot's drift -but they don't.

Sure, a bot with 2 TX-1 SMGs and 4 T10 SMGs starts off with 8 damage, however it'll likely lose half of its firepower (The 2 TX-1s) faster than a regular 8-9 T10 SMG will. Initial firepower versus redundancy, there is no true winner. They both suit different play styles, in my opinion."

Robocraft,3bznv1,dark_devil_dd,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:22:10 2015 UTC,"While your point is true, there are some other factors that also should be considered.   While redundancy is generally a good thing, it effectively reduces damage with mega SMG as with more weapons the mega SMG gets to fire less often. Though as you lose weapons, your DPS might actually increase instead depending on which guns are shot off. Similar to the redundancy issue, When SMG sniping/tapfire you don't really want to shoot with your regular SMG guns as it will deal less damage, If you mostly fight at large ranges you might only want Mega SMG to maximize damage per shot as attack speed and redundancy aren't as important in such a scenario. Though in such a scenario you might want to consider a 3x Mega SMG setup to get some more defense and just rely on tapfire. The attack speed increase of adding guns is not linear. In general your bots DPS increases enormously until you have at least 4 weapons where it slows down and stops right after 6. Using regular SMGs as example, your DPS drops by 10% by going from 6 to 5 guns and about 12% going from 5 to 4 guns, but going from 4 to 3 reduces your current DPS by 50% which is fatal in a close combat battle. So simply losing a gun means you are likely already dead with a 4 weapon SMG setup.   So yeah, while there might be reasons to use a 4 mega SMG setup, it's really fragile even disregarding the cubes as your huge damage is halved by simply losing a gun.  To simply some other alternatives with attack speed in mind here is a short list based of a regular SMG tank.  6x+ t10 SMG - 168+ CPU - 100% damage  4x Mega SMG - 1000 CPU - 160% damage  4x Mega+2x t10 SMG - 1056 CPU - 166,7% damage  3x Mega+3x t10 SMG - 834 CPU - 150% damage  2x Mega+4x t10 SMG - 612 CPU - 133,3% damage  1x Mega+5x t10 SMG - 395 CPU - 116,6% damage  2x Mega+6x t10 SMG - 668 CPU - 125% damage  TL:DR - Real glass cannons use a 4x mega + 2x t10 SMG setup and redundancy with mega SMG might reduce your damage."
Robocraft,3bznv1,toby1248,2,Fri Jul 3 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"You're right in all of your points and i'm aware of them. But the thing is, that these glass cannon builds with 3 or more megas offten come with problems in mobility. Also it is a problem to attache those large Mega SMG's, resulting in not all can hit the target. This then dramatically reduces the damage.  The Possible damage is as you state a little higher, but in reality you will most likely not hit with all guns as intended. That reduces this amount by a large margin."

Robocraft,3c0936,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Mon Jul 6 01:25:43 2015 UTC,"I agree. A score multiplier should not exist period when dealing with competitive ELO scores. The results are so skewed and rarely will people ever rank up when they lose. The devs did mention the double multiplier shouldn't be there but if they still want being on the winning the team the big factor in ranking up I think it's a terrible system.   Being on the losing team does not make you a bad player and vise versa and that is what these scores are supposed to represent. It's blatantly unfair and ridiculous for a personal score to be heavily tied to team efforts. A player can be the best in the world but they can't do it all. These scores are supposed to help balance teams with players of equal skill but how can such a score truly be effective when the biggest factor is your team, not you.   There will always be a winning and a losing side. It doesn't matter if you're a good player or a bad player you can be on both sides. Each side is truly a different ball game. When you're on the winning side things are generally easier. You have a better team and they offer a lot of support, getting kills or capping towers is easier. Now if you're on the losing team things are harder. You can truly put your heart into a game but no one player can do it all.   I think the best systems are when the multiplier needs to be removed entirely and all scores compared or each team is graded separately. Both will give the same outcome and it will truly compare the players abilities against each other with as little biased as I think they can get."

If one of the wings gets destroyed then both will likely get destroyed (like what happened at 11:34 in your video, causing you to lose control and crash). Also, I don't see any backwards-facing thrusters, which means that if your plane gets stuck then it's fucked. Backwards facing thrusters are also handy in that they let you slow down mid flight to bomb towers or get precise shots off on people. Due to the sheer amount of chasis cubes you already have, you should switch all of the armored cubes to armored inners since the difference in health (~3%) is negligible compared to the decrease in weight (~33%), which would make your plane faster and more controllable at earlier OC levels."

But thinking about it further, I still don't think that would work for 90% of flyers. I'm not too keen on the details, but I'm pretty sure a plane's weight is distributed to its wings. Each wing holds the weight closest to it best and weight furthest from it poorest. This is why if you lose both of your back wings your plane can't fly properly, while if you lose some wings in the middle of the plane you can fly well enough. I think putting a pair of wings at risk means losing the ability to hold that section of weight of your plane up, while putting one at risk means the other wing may be able to compensate.   Since we're talking about ""controlled"" destruction (if one wing goes they both go is kind of like a planned destruction pathway), I think it would be wiser to use triforcing to direct damage towards heavy chasis cubes instead of CPU heavy parts like a paired wing. When a wing gets destroyed, then maybe the weight (chasis cubes) that it was responsible for could be lost with it, which means the paired wing has less to compensate for and the plane can fly better. Not to mention, if 2 heavy CPU parts get destroyed at the same time then you're essentially losing a HUGE part of your bot, while if some chasis cubes get destroyed you lose virtually negligible CPU."
Robocraft,3bzr62,Psatch,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:19:52 2015 UTC,"There are definitely downsides to the method. Its not one I use for instance. I prefer to have triforce separated layers of redundant wings at the center of mass for my bots, that way, if some get blown off, I still have lift at my center of mass."
Robocraft,3bzr62,TheAero1221,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:36:46 2015 UTC,"Serious question:  If you're built to take some hits, why do you immediately retreat to the shield after taking any damage at all?  There were many instances where you could've been much more useful to the team but you were constantly just running back to base any time someone scuffed your paint.  All anyone had to do was shoot you once to remove you from battle for a not insignificant amount of time.  This rather defeats the purpose of being able to take hits:  so that you can stay in battle longer and contribute more.  For the first half of the match you spend more time flying to and from the shield than contributing, when you didn't have to.  (Not to say that it's the same as someone whose bot is actually crippled by a few shots and they have to go back - the point here is that many times you have nothing more than superficial damage and you immediately disengage.)"

I would say that if you get a 4 thruster stick platoon on the enemy team and especially if it's one of those ""clan"" platoons, then you have very little chances of winning. But they're still not impossible to beat. I remember when I and my team made a comeback from a classic battle we thought was already lost since we couldn't destroy the 4 thruster sticks.

Robocraft,3bxtvh,ElegantBiscuit,2,Fri Jul 3 03:34:49 2015 UTC,"Thrustersticks have their strengths against bots like plasma bombers or copters, but really struggle against SMGs and rails. Once you know how to kill them easily, they just become more of an annoyance (unless theres 4 of them buzzing above you). The pilot seat is almost always near the front so just try and aim there and you'll probably take out some vital turning thrusters or big parts of it. Also, if they're flying around you, stop what you're doing and start shooting them immediately or else they'll likely tear you to shreds. Take cover from any enemies if you can, or get under a roof to avoid the thrusterstick.  Work in progress megas will always be a problem until Freejam adds a higher minimum CPU requirement or puts lower CPU mega into T9."

Robocraft,3c1ev5,hadrianw,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:01:03 2015 UTC,"I do not think this is a good idea. If you want to balance a weapon there are plenty of other ways to do so: decrease damage, decrease range, increase recharge time, etc. without having to sacrifice the ""character"" of the weapon. What I mean by the ""character"" of the weapon is that railguns are precision burst damage weapons and plasmas are medium/long range AOE burst damage. If you change the rate of fire to make railguns and plasmas like SMGs then it means the weapons are less distinct, and in my opinion they game would be a little less fun.  Personally, I think the weapons are quite balanced as they are now -- at least to the point where making such a drastic change like your suggestion is not worth it.  Also, I'd argue there is more action currently than your update would bring. Battle isn't just about looking at your opponent and firing some guns -- at least it doesn't have to be, which I think would happen if FJ were to implement your idea. The current gunplay means that players have to be wary of their environment and use the environment to the players' advantage. Plasmas might want to build so their bot is designed to blow their loads and take cover to recharge. The current gunplay is dynamic and fun!  If you're having trouble with using your SMGer you maybe have to start thinking outside the box. Try using cover to hide from plasma bombers and railguns. Try spotting players and moving around into a better position to attack. I think you have plenty of resources available, you just have to use them!"

Maybe call this one Fujitsu to fit with the IRL supercomputer naming and make it sound badass.  I've been thinking about potential SCU concepts, and cloak was one of the first ideas to crop up. Mine was almost exactly like yours, but also included disabling EPs for the duration, and/or have the cloak suffer disturbance when shot by accident, making the user translucent for a split second. Not sure whether these would fit or make it underpowered, but it's something to consider.  Also I fully agree, tesla must shut down while cloaked. It's only logical, and fair too.

Remember it has to cycle through all guns, so 4 t10 and 2 megas will do more damage then 5 t10s and 2 mega's.  And one extra gun won't help that much.  I have tried a lot of versions with 2 mega smg's. This is my favorite so far (one in front of the other) http://imgur.com/PaVkW9l though honestly mine probably dies just as easy as yours (or easier).

I was essentially grabbing a tower choosing to ignore a plasma raining down on me while scoped to grab a tower desprately. I thought it was a bomber hitting my top. I unescoped and looked back.... Plasma tank was just shooting into my backside with a medic begind it.... I still killed it.   Doesn't matter how well armored you are when you got a fistfull of tesla and some hot plasma stripping guns.  Sea scorpions my favorite tesla bot Even rails couldn't take me down with that thing.   I'd always be first up to get a tower, take the enemy team out when they are grabbing a tower with the overclock points using the teslas and then get a large buffer of defense and damage between me and them.   Best part was this whole one two punch idea where you lead in with one fist and they are like ""AW SHIT SHOOT IT SHOOT IT!"" and then I hit them with the other side."
Robocraft,3bqa8v,KillaJoke,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:08:17 2015 UTC,and then you sit in a corner and cry when anything that is flying decide to look in your general direction cuz you are using a ground based plasma and have no mean of retaliation. Nowadays most things that are flying either: can't really be hit by plasma from the ground (planes and thrustersticks with OC speed) or straight up ignore plasma damage (tank copters).
Robocraft,3bqa8v,Khoakuma,3,Wed Jul 1 14:43:36 2015 UTC,"There's two aspect's of the game there m8. If I keep your tank's busy and crying for their mama they can't cap towers... If they can't keep those towers you can't fly back to base with your tale between your legs.  I tanked plenty of shot's from bombers with the sea scorpion and plucked their base sheild out beneath their noses.  Flying is all well and good, but their biggest benifit of the meta is to fly back to base for a quick heal when a rotor blade or a wing pops off. Keep them from doing that and you're nothing more then a paper weight that's got one hell of a short lifespan.  I was playing copter before the new meta and ditched them the moment tanks got a nerf in prep for the copter apocalypse to start using the downsides I learned early on against them.   plasma can be dodged with smart play and knowing the weakness of plasma playing against a plasma copter can easily outdo the high ground advantage. Wait for the shot, move towards the enemy bot  once the plasma cannon fire's. Plasma need's to predict a target's movements and hope the projectile ark hits. Stand still and you remove the ability to predict. They need to fire where you are at currently or wait for you to move. The further up in the air you are the longer it takes your plasma to reach me.  If you're an smg copter you need to come nice and close to do anything against me, but that comes at the risk of me coming bellow you and popping your rotor's off.  Besides... How are you gonna look in my general direction if your tanks can't fight my tanks from plucking you out of the sky? ;p"
Robocraft,3bqa8v,KillaJoke,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:20:01 2015 UTC,you seem to be under the impression that all tank players are stupid shitheads who can't play anything else. edit: maybe some of them have tesla and plasma bots too and actually knows how to fight them.
Robocraft,3bqa8v,Khoakuma,2,Wed Jul 1 15:22:49 2015 UTC,"Considering how most of them get one shot by rails, use aero rod's for polls, or build their cockpit near the ground... Just a weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee bit.  Have I seen good tanks? Yeah I've seen some good tanks... It's just the amount of crap tanks outnumber the good ones. And even then I've still dealt with tanky tanks and medic combos. They get cocky because of a medic providing support, but a tesla is all about one single moment of heavy duty damage that cleaves through a bot's defenses.  That medic can rightclick all they want, they aren't undoing that tesla jab ANY time soon.  Plus the tesla style is all about sneaking up on someone. You may know how to fight against them if you see them coming, but a tesla's all about hitting them when the gaurds down.  And nothing lowers the defenses like the enemy trying to grab a tower. Especially early game, look at how you can actually manage to pluck a tower they were working for in the begging of the match just to pluck it away with one well timed shot.   Overclocking is all about momentum. Get that early game momentum and you are going to be tough for them to take down."

Yup, you are absolutely right about everything.  It kinda piss me off when people hoping on light electroplates builds and thinking they can go up and 1v1 a tank. But you seems to understand tactical gameplay pretty well, especially the concept of window of opportunity. It's all about window of opportunity, and that is where the line of skills being more important than builds. Even the best players are limited by what they can see in front of them, no one is invulnerable to backstabbing.       Overclocking is all about momentum. Get that early game momentum and you are going to be tough for them to take down.       Then I have nothing else to say. Electroplates is definitely the hardware for your snowballing need. Nothing feels worse than being down 3 levels to a fully plated build."

I'm not gonna risk my self or my medic. I'm not gonna give away free cpu even if I can push through and kill you anyway. I've done 2v4 on a tank this way. That said thanks are most of the time kind of boring so I don't play them anymore.  Also you are right. If you play any decent bot right you can win against any bot. Even sometimes against megas.  Rosefalls designs are strong and I approve of people using them. I've even tested one of his copters out of curiosity. EP is arguably weaker than block spam but it has advantages over it. If you get nipped on election and move out of the way, it regenerates. If you get nipped on a block and move out of the way it doesn't. So mobility is key for an EP user."
Robocraft,3bqa8v,Never-Wolf,3,Thu Jul 2 02:25:06 2015 UTC,"Cant speak for this build, but I used three other bots of his and still possess one. The bomber is just a flying fortress, able to fly back at 30-40%, so a good Jack of all trades. The other 2 bots both had each one weakness, but that depends on the bot, when avoiding one weakness they are often superior in all other fields. Edit: not all bots use electroplates as this one does"
Robocraft,3bqa8v,SNOR97,5,Wed Jul 1 09:10:56 2015 UTC,"The black widow bomber with the twin tails? Flying fortress? I love having them on the enemy team because it means easy kills, sometimes one-shots when I'm a sniper.  The paladin pictured here really isn't good. And the popular helicopter with the electroplates is kinda tough but has terrible firing angle and only 6 guns, plus you lose 2 rotors out of 4 on each hit. You gotta face your enemy perfectly frontal to get all guns to hit him, that's really bad.   Drognin used a rail of his with 5 guns, which looked ok but had rails mounted to the side. Obviously, this means again you gotta move from left to right to actually hit enemies with both shots. I saw droggypoo miss a few important shots simply because the gun firing angle couldn't possibly hit the enemy.   So, what I'm saying is, they're mostly built for looks. You can use them, but it's the pilot skill that makes a bot good. And his bots aren't efficient."

Even if it's a super rare weak point, I make efforts to eliminate it.  His bots look nice, and they're decent, but not the best.  They're better than a lot of the garbage people run, though.

Robocraft,3bqa8v,Juvar23,0,Wed Jul 1 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"Pssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhh not actually competitive... As you say knowing a bot's weaknesses is important. For those facing it and those playing it. Someone that's playing it and know's it's weaknesses can overcome those weaknesses by playing to it's strengths. It goes both way's. The problem comes when it's more of an introductory bot, and a player doesn't recognise those weaknesses and doesn't take measures to fight against them.  They are a great way to learn the game and see the power of building but they eventually realize that build and play exist alongside eachother.   I'm sure once the shops come along rosefall wont be the only one being put on the chopping block.  Even the more experienced player's will have their bot's grilled for certain weakpoints. Rent a bot someone sells, take it into battle, throw yourself into enemy fire and look for where it fails the most and you then can rip someones asshole open after learning how they think and build.   When a bad player rent's your bot be ready for the insults and bullshit to come flinging your way smack talkers. ;p"

That's why I often copy bots."

They were tanky enough to handle the enemy or crippled them enough to slow them down and make it safe for you.   slow health loss coming in waves=Plasma bot most likely plinking away. You can probably intervene and be fine assisting them, but don't make it easy for the plasma unit to hit you.  Large varying chunks of health loss= railer be extremely careful with this. They have a reload time and you can possibly get your teamate back in the fight but they excel in piercing through a bot. Take cover if you can and don't be too distraught if you can't heal them back to a point they  can fight back. They have crazy good damage in bursts from a large range.   Also medic's have really good protonivity. You can essentially zip up crystals, so if your on the backfoot of the match you may occasionally  need to go on the offense and pull some sneaky moves and go where there is the least conflict to grab a tower. Make sure to hit the spines and stop occasionally to check that you took out the crystals. It can be hard to tell sometimes. Also swipe them up and down to get a good clean cut.   Don't be to distraught if someone died or self distructed calling out for you. If you cap a tower they can rejoin the fight instantly.   The medic game is all about judgement.

Robocraft,3bq8y2,NotHomo,5,Wed Jul 1 09:25:00 2015 UTC,"I was going to vote Yes, but decided to vote No at the end. There is a part of the community that are against any sort of restriction and want to to build literally everything they want and have it work, often exploiting some nooks and crannies which seemingly unreasonable and cannot be balanced in a pvp game. And there is people like me, mostly less vocal (well I am pretty vocal), who wants the gameplay to solidify into a tangible, competitive combat game, still with endless opportunity of customization, as opposed to being a haphazard combat sandbox. However I do agree that these restriction are getting a bit too far. There is a time which everyone regardless of stance have to draw a line and keep certain degree of freedom in the game.  I would rather it just go back to the old roboranking system to determine a bot's worthiness.  Make the OT maximum +1 by heavily punishing +2 with extremely high roboranking, and decrease the minimum armor requirement to -2 to let people tier up easier with armor and not just gun, keep the CPU limit to prevent landship clubbers."

Robocraft,3bq8y2,radyjko,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:29:36 2015 UTC,"500 CPU and outclass most 1511 CPU builds are you high? I ensure every bot I build is 1511 CPU. There is always a radar jammer or receiver or radar you can stick on your bot or throw some ep plates on there if you have the CPU left. Not using all 100% of your CPU at tier 10 is downright stupid. Especially for the new meta where you get into prolonged fights. You are immediately putting yourself and your team at a disadvantage when you don't use atleast 1300 CPU or more. There are maybe 1 or 2 exemptions to this. But that's about it. You ever wonder why smg gun beds are so prevalent? It's because they are easy to use they have ridiculous amounts of block or ep armor and the have enough guns and redundancy to engage in long drawn out battles.  While the guys who build light fast ""support"" vehicles cant cope. Don't get me wrong support vehicles have their places but if you're going to play support and you're not using all of the CPU you possibly can then you're out of your mind. Strap a radar or a radar blocker or another gun on there something. But don't disadvantage your team just to prove a point or to have it ""look cool"" that's what the hub/pit will be for when it comes."

The resources to learn are posted everywhere. On Reddit. On the forums. On robocraft garage. It's not like its some hidden secret. Putting a minimum CPU cap atleast increases the chances that if they're building a shit bot theyll click some cubes into the right place and maybe help the team a little more then just being 4 wheels and 1 tier 10 gun. Why even build a bot like that. It's so infuriating to know you're already a bot down just by looking around and seeing that. People like that ruin the game. This is a team game.

I cant think of anything else :( This is me when i open up robocraft everytime. I open it up, spend sometime ""building"" a bot and then end up erasing all the blocks.

I start off with a core concept like ""walker/sled, EP hover brick"" etc. I don't worry about triforcing right off the bat. I just make a line of blocks with a seat on it to start from. If I have to adjust the seat as I go, it doesn't matter. The placement shifts around as I build. Much like the vertebra and the limb positioning move around and adjust in a womb. Unless I'm using huge electroplates I don't go for any sort of shape, as I've learned I can't. The shape just kind of happens and once it does it's all down hill from there. No one's gonna move me from my computer til it's mostly finished. After that I test it in practice mode dozens of times until it handles just right. Then I reinforce the obvious spots, even if I have to dig out blocks and replace them to do it. Then I test it in battle, and if any weakspots come up, I correct them as best I can. Maybe you're sorta like me and building is almost more of a biological process than a mechanical one."

I think this idea is absolute elitist bullshit, designed to benefit no one but a few who wants to create a sense of exclusivity and superiority. Reducing income serves no purpose but to force people to make even weaker bots. We want to slow down progression with the purpose of exposing new players to more experience and playstyle, not to make the high tiers and strong bots some sort of special club only for people who have spent months in this game.    And for a frame of reference, I started playing when repair cost was in place. It took me nearly a month to hit tier 10, 3 months to reach lvl100 because premium didnt doubled exp, have been playing for 10 months now, have 80 mil RP in hard cash, around 30 mil in materials and an estimated 200 mil on the megabot and 14 T10 bots. And I still think this is a horrible idea."

One Game for a few armour blocks.  BUT we maybe get a lot of RP than before after they invented Battle mode. That I do not know. When i was tiering up with premium codes, as i started around christmas 2014, i felt quite satisfied with the money iam getting but still thought tiering up is work to do in a good way.  Dont know how it now feels with battles and while there is not a premium code around every corner^  But even when we are getting double RP we got than 6 monts ago and the armour is cheaper now, the reason tiering up is so fast are others worse.  The OT change and enabling T+1 Weapons on a Tier is the cause for this and also the cause for badly build robots just putting weapons on them reducing lower tier armour but not buying the new one to fill the CPU.  Remove the T+1 weapons and players need to build full CPU bots again with more armour to buy to reach the next tier. This will slow down progression AND improve overall bot quality in matches.

However, cutting RP gain will accomplish nothing but further diminishing creativity. Players will be less enthusiastic about creating a new bot knowing that it will take them weeks to grind for the parts.  I believe the real intent is to inflate GC sales by making parts more difficult to purchase with RP. In reality, with the motivation to make new bots decreased, garage slot sales will plummet. Without a garage to make a bot, nobody will be buying parts with GC anyways. Unless of course garages become free, in which case I have wasted a crap load of GC on buying 30 garage slots."

So in that regard, nerfing rp gains. for people with a ton of garages means they are kicking their customers in the balls. cause they are the ones that said. oh i wanna make more and more robots. and they are the ones supporting the game after all."
Robocraft,3bpu21,Tussca,3,Wed Jul 1 07:20:01 2015 UTC,"The voting options don't fit my opinion either so I'll post them.   Nerfing rp gain would drive players away. I play t10 so I don't need to progress any further but I still need all the rp I can get when building new bots and paying with new stuff. Normally you can't sell parts at full price so you have to either buy the minimum amount or accept you'll lose a good chunk of your money if you don't like it (yes you can use parts later but if you decide to make an smg tank after trying to make a nano hover that's a lot of money you can't use for awhile)  An easy example of how this drives players away. I just built a bot that cost close to 7 million rp at t10. On average I get about 400,000 rp with premium and the extra premium players bonus. So a player without premium gets half that. If you further cut that in half to slow down progression it would take 70 games to grind through to get the rp for one bot... for a game where one of the selling points is building bots your making the building part kinda hard....  Something else that I feel makes this a good game is that it's not a pay to win game. And if you have to be premium to bother playing (aka getting enough rp to make bots) you've made it pay to win...  IMO if you want to slow people down  slow down the xp gain or something like that. So you have to (kind of) grind to get the cpu to play in the higher tiers. I've heard of too many people that have more cpu than they know what to do with and as such get into tiers they're not ready for."

You can call me crazy, but a few of my friends and I in-game have noticed a huge decrease in RP gain after T10 matches. I used to get around 1M RP for doing decently well in a T10 battle match, with premium + 2x daily bonus. Recently though, even during the promocode period with 200% buff, I did extremely well in a T10 battle match, ranked highest in score on my team, got a ton of kills and more or less carried the team to victory. Using that combined with premium + my 2x daily bonus, I got 500k. Serious BS. I'm trying to save up, build more bots, and go full Carbon, but the match rewards were just somehow nerfed to hell, and such projects are taking forever. I'm not the only one who has noticed this.

My way of making progress slower, would be:  ingame Tasks:  Lets say you are the smartest guy in the world, u just skipped 2 tiers cause you are so smart, and u have a robot that's 4 wheels undertiered armor by 2 tiers and 1 or a bunch of random weapons from diferent tiers. u want to keep rushing throught the game, is such a shame the way to advance its to complete a certain number of games of the tier, winning. and is also a shame that the way to unlock points is based on certain tasks ingame:  Each match would give you a certain task depending on which kind of robot you are, and weapon type.  lets say, Do X amount of damage. This seems like a silly thing, but most rushing robots on the last patch arent combat ready at all. this would prevent them from keep doing their silly tactic. and use a viable progression on their robot.  Healers should be asigned to do other things such as capturing or destroying a certain amount of crystals, to prevent medics from becoming the easy way of tiering.  Plasmas and railguns could have tasks similar to the smg ones.  in that way people have to make good robots that dont feed for 20 minutes hoping they get slowly tech points to go to their next tier to keep doing the same till they get to tier 10 being useless.   nerfing RP gain is nerfing creativity as a whole, would u rather try something new out, and risk expending a shitton on rp u slowly grinded on something u dont like, or will you do a boring gunbed like anyone else does in the earlier tiers?. Robocraft as a game, is a game that atracts people cause ur able to make all sorts of crazy things. the only thing that limits what u can do at the start is: cpu, rp, and knowledge.

But now with 8 people on each team and 3 towers, Copters often have to engage in what they fear the most: Full out team fights.  They are the best skirmisher hands down, not many things can win agaisnt them in a 1v1 save very heavy tank or other copters, and it can match thrustersticks and plane's mobility (all of this assuming very well built ones with 4 rotors minimum), hence in small engagement they reign supreme.  However in drawn out organized teamfights, their massive size (most copters have more surface area than tanks) make them easy target for focus firing, and the fact that rotors despite very tanky on their own are still completely exposed.  They are insane when facing a small group of enemy where they can corner and somewhat protect their rotor blades, but when facing damage from multiple direction, they drop very very fast. Also plasma chopter are the gatekeepers of T10.  Your builds either have to withstand at least 2 full barrage or avoid them by flying, otherwise you will feed miserably and they will become insanely obnoxious.

The issue is that when you shoot these they lose functionality, or become more vulnerable.  But when you shoot redundant copters they lose redundancy. That's pretty much it.  Redundant weaponry on tanks and gunbeds is nasty enough as is, but redundant mobility is just obnoxious."
Robocraft,3bqgyt,Khoakuma,2,Wed Jul 1 09:57:25 2015 UTC,"there is seemingly some unannounced physics change  sneaked in this patch that make rotors less stable with only 2 blades.  Before I can just fly perfectly with 2/6 rotor blades on my copters. But now while they can still fly, they seems to destabilize and goes off balance more often. Just annecdotal, take with a grain of salt."
Robocraft,3bqgyt,Gamer9103,-1,Wed Jul 1 10:09:47 2015 UTC,"Reduced stability with a few rotors isn't the biggest issue, the fact that rotors compensate perfectly no matter how unbalanced they are is. With any other movement type if you shoot off one side, everything gets unbalanced, but with rotors, they just balance everything perfectly by themselves."
Robocraft,3bqgyt,Gamer9103,0,Wed Jul 1 11:23:07 2015 UTC,rotors compensate perfectly no matter how unbalanced they ar   They don't really. Rotors often randomly seize up and you lose control for 5-10 seconds.
Robocraft,3bqgyt,Seaberry47,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:59:35 2015 UTC,I've never had that happen with my rotors. Are you mixing them with thrusters/wings?
Robocraft,3bqgyt,Shaftronics,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:10:16 2015 UTC,"Regularly happens to me that controls seize up. If that happens I can no longer turn. Pressing left (and only left while hovering in place) for example flips the copter over in place or it just tumbles uncontrollably to the ground. No wings, and thrusters only for forward movement, not for turning. After 5-10 seconds it returns to normal."
Robocraft,3bqgyt,Shaftronics,4,Wed Jul 1 18:03:09 2015 UTC,ABSOLUTELY NOT. My rotors are always getting blasted off before other bits  If anything they need a buff.
Robocraft,3bqgyt,KillaJoke,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:46:20 2015 UTC,"Of course your rotors get blasted off /before other bits/, the issue is that when they get blasted off you don't lose much in the way of functionality, but you're FORCED to build highly redundant in the first place.  A better solution perhaps would to be more durable rotors with less redundancy?"
Robocraft,3bqgyt,Gamer9103,3,Wed Jul 1 16:53:29 2015 UTC,"Not really. Shooting rotors off skyboxes (my personal nickname for them, since you really can't miss them with a rail cannon) and leaving them for dead usually means a medic is going to come by and heal it, or it'll be left there until someone picks it apart. Until then, it's a stationary box with guns on it.   OP? Not really. I feel that it's fair to have a tanky flier, considering a stick bomber could fly over one and pick it apart due to its lack of mobility.  Who said there's not much variety now?"
Robocraft,3bqgyt,NotHomo,0,Wed Jul 1 13:00:09 2015 UTC,Shooting rotors off skyboxes   How do you shoot off 8 or 10 rotors? Because it's certainly not with rails.
Robocraft,3brb55,Throwaway_account134,6,Wed Jul 1 14:54:55 2015 UTC,"The advantage of less guns is using less cpu, carrying less mass and having a lower robot ranking. For this you pay with DPS.  It makes no real sense of have more damage per gun when you have less guns. If you want more dps, get more guns. It's how these things works."
Robocraft,3brb55,paegus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:22:52 2015 UTC,Ok so if I'm building a tier 10 rail how does having less robot ranking help me? I think OP's suggestion should be applied to all weapon types. My only caveats would be that having less weapons would increase accuracy and damage per shot for all weapon types while more guns would decrease accuracy and damage per shot. Having more then 6 weapons would increase dps past its current point but at that point it would be very inaccurate and only good for up close pushes. I think this would allow people to balance out how they would want their robot to work. Tanks would become actual pushing tanks with smg's being less of a jack of all trades weapon.
Robocraft,3brb55,deniumddr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:14:29 2015 UTC,I feel like there should be some real advantage of this though.  We have a fairly decent chunk of CPU already at max level and enough to go overboard with twelve gun's of redundancy and still scoff off with plenty of armor cubes.   What about the less gun's you have the faster you overclock? Seeing some build's pick their overclock prime time such as a three gun bomber that start's out a bit weak damage wise but climbs the ladder fairly quickly to make up for it in clock cycles where they have fire rate increase and a bit of that overclock damage buff making their damage capable of doing something against a gunbed that still had redundancy but doesn't snowball out of control like a three gun plasma bomber.

I could climb sheer cliff faces with it, it was fast as hell, never flipped due to its wide stance, and it was low-profile so I could use terrain as extra armor. It even had steering thrusters so I could zip across the ice on Gliese Lake with total control.  Then they nerfed thrusters. Then they murdered wheels. Now I use plasma copters to get the same freedom of movement."

Flying erratically to keep fresh EPs facing your target gives this oterwise fragile bot surprising survivability. Time your attack so that your team will come around the corner immediately after the enemy start to focus on you. Most of the time they will keep firing at you while your team tears them a new one.

Robocraft,3bpl0u,BBQFACE,4,Wed Jul 1 03:11:37 2015 UTC,You can easily get to t9 with your mega. Simply play a classic match with a t9 bot against a mega. Then switch to your mega and you'll be in the t9 queue. To get back to t10 simply play a t10 classic game with a t10 bot. The system is a bit bugged there.

Robocraft,3bn0dc,kenogo,5,Wed Jul 1 12:08:24 2015 UTC,Well my issue is how easy guns are to shoot off.   Fights would be more fun and last longer if guns weren't so easily disabled.  If guns were harder to disable then the quality of the bot itself would matter more.
Robocraft,3bn0dc,DumberMonkey,6,Tue Jun 30 16:08:04 2015 UTC,i'm with this guy  i'd rather the best strategy for killing someone be drilling their core than to strip their weapons because getting your weapons stripped means you're just sitting there afterwards waiting to die helpless.  at least if you get your pilot seat drilled then it's over and done
Robocraft,3bn0dc,NotHomo,3,Tue Jun 30 19:28:19 2015 UTC,"Right, I agree. But people (including me) have been screaming this for forever, to no avail. It's their sacred gunbrella thing (now resistivity)."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,NotHomo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:06:59 2015 UTC,"well if you think about it, making weapons more durable brings the game closer in-line with other MOBAs where the characters fight at full power until they die  and it's not like you can use WEAPONS as ARMOR unlike people using TANK TREADS... :D"
Robocraft,3bn0dc,Sindoray,2,Tue Jun 30 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't this mean even more dmg overall, since the weapons won't be destroyed that fast, which means even more DPS uptime? Just wondering."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,Sindoray,2,Tue Jun 30 21:27:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it would. It accomplishes pretty much the opposite from my post, but I still think it's a good suggestion. I feel that if, for example, both would be implemented together it'd be ideal, as battles would last longer AND you'd actually have the guns to keep it interesting (instead of husks ramming each other)."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,Sindoray,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:46:58 2015 UTC,"My only issue about the game (i'm newly tier 9 with about 130 hours playtime) is SMGs and gun beds. The moment i try to do a thing as a plane, half my plane is gone, and i'm falling down. The moment i'm targeted, i'm already half dead.   If i play as a SMG gun bed, i can go hurr durr and do the most dmg, and taking out almost anything comes at me. No plane comes close to bombard me, and unless you are rail (which i hit from range as well) you die almost instantly.   Same goes for my plasma plane. If i hit my barrage on you, you are either dead, or already half dead. Then you either kill me, or i throw another barrage and you die. This part about the game seems like a dull skill-less fight.   This is coming from someone who played World of Tanks previously, and aiming/moving takes some amount of skill. Even the way you ""park"" your tank is depending on the armor and the angle of your tank to be as tanky as possible. Stuff like this isn't here in Robocraft, and SMG just hurr durr anything for easy kills. At least this is how i have seen it in my T1-T8 (new to T9, so won't talk about that now)."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,DumberMonkey,2,Tue Jun 30 23:20:53 2015 UTC,"I actually think bombers are pretty good against SMG tanks now, as long as they stay far away. It used to be a lot worse (SMG's did full damage and had perfect accuracy at infinite range when burst firing. They were the perfect anti-air and flyers just weren't viable). While the noise and flashes may make it seem like you're getting ripped apart, the actual damage they do at that range is pretty weak, while your plasma is still effective.  But that's at T10 and level 100. I can imagine your planes aren't optimal yet as you're still leveling and maybe learning.  But yeah, the ""dull, skill-less fights"" are what I think a damage reduction may be able to solve, as it gives room for options during a fight."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,deniumddr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"The reason i stopped playing World of Tanks, and started playing Robocraft is that i thought both are kinda the same. World of Tanks is either buy premium and grind at lower tiers, or you run out of money to repair your tank (example: if your robot is destroyed after the battle, you have to pay to repair it. Same goes for ammo).  Robocraft also had the creative part, which i loved. It would be more fun to have longer than 1 sec fights. Where you take your time before randomly firing.   I like your idea about lower down the dmg. This means longer fights before you are actually destroyed."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,deniumddr,2,Wed Jul 1 12:23:58 2015 UTC,"Well DPS is the same. means if they can't kill your guns they kill the ship.  IF guns were harder to kill I would accept a limit on them.  but as it is, with only 6 you are pretty screwed.  Too easy to lose your guns (in a close in battle)  I ran extra's no matter what type I use. Nano or Plasma or SMG."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,boybrushedplad,5,Tue Jun 30 22:50:52 2015 UTC,At first I was going to agree with you but after thinking about it I think this would be kind of bad for the game. It would make gun beds much harder to kill. I think if anything they need to change gun characteristics. If you have more guns on your vehicle it lowers damage the weapon does but maybe also increases fire rate. Then the inverse would be true as well. So less guns equals slower fire rate but higher damage per shot. More guns would also decrease accuracy while less guns increases it. This makes gun beds viable as up close pushing machines and light support craft viable as support craft. IMO this would solve a lot of the problems people have with gun beds. You could probably also increase block health a little bit so engagement s last longer and you can call for support. It provides a strategic side to robocraft too because if you see a gun bed you want to keep him at a distance and use terrain to take pot shots at him. While if you're playing the gun bed you want to close the distance so you can use your superior dps and weapon count to kill the enemy. Sorry for any grammar mistakes I'm on mobile. Also if you are going to downvote me atleast provide me some feedback as to why :)
Robocraft,3bn0dc,deniumddr,6,Tue Jun 30 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, gunbeds would be harder to kill, but so will every other bot. So I don't see how this will affect gunbeds more than anything else.  If anything, rails are probably affected by this the most as they rely on doing destructive damage in an instant. But one could argue they're a bit strong now anyway. Aiming at specific parts of a bot will become much more important for them."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,DeepMidWicket,2,Tue Jun 30 15:57:07 2015 UTC,You replied to one part of my post selectively then ignored the rest? It makes gun beds  more op. It doesn't solve anything. I don't personally have a problem with gun beds but they are very powerful. Giving them more survivability which is their biggest advantage only gives them more of an advantage over other bots. While some of the smaller support designs will suffer because they don't have the block count of a gun bed. So it takes gun beds strengths and makes them even stronger. I believe my solution offers a more balanced approach to solving the gun bed problem and increasing strategy in the game which is what you are asking for. It is also a buff to survivability for some bots but not all. It makes a 12 smg gun bed much less accurate at distance but much more dangerous up close. While making a support smg with  6 smgs a bot that is better suited for medium/long range engagements yet can still handle itself relatively well up close.
Robocraft,3bn0dc,Mister_Alpha,2,Tue Jun 30 16:11:25 2015 UTC,I completely agree with this.   I think this is the perfect solution to balancing redundancy.  I hope Mark does decide to implement it
Robocraft,3bn0dc,DeepMidWicket,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:28:20 2015 UTC,"Thing is, I don't think gunbeds are OP or a problem, so my idea has no intention of 'solving' them.  That said, I do like the idea that choosing to have less guns gives an advantage, as I'm all for options and choices when making bots. I just don't think it's very relevant to my suggestion, as I believe there's not much wrong with gunbeds as they are."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,kenogo,0,Tue Jun 30 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"There wouldn't be a problem with gun beds if they weren't the predominant type of build in the game. The only reason most people build them is because they are the easiest to build and the easiest to play at a decently competitive level. To play them well however takes building skill and player skill. If you make gun beds less viable however it promotes people to build varieties of other bots especially with my suggestion because you will see different combinations of weapons and amounts of weapons. Gun beds aren't as big of a problem as people make them out to be however, they are the most prominent build in the game and variety is the spice of life. So my solution solves the gun bed problem(whether there is or isn't one is debatable) and adds strategy to the game which is what you were wanting in your original post. Just making guns do less damage doesn't really change all that much about the meta or the gameplay. IMO"
Robocraft,3bn0dc,gaso,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"As a rail gunner, I wouldn't want my guns any less effective, the new update now means my guns are on tier, I used to be able to one shot most things, now I'm having to learn my enemy's bot to find the one shot, if it's a good bot then there is not a possibility of the one shot, considering this and the fact the towers have moved so hiding in the shield is no longer a thing and that with the current power and reload time of the rails it's rare I can take a bot in close combat."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,Sindoray,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:53:42 2015 UTC,"One-shot is nice when it happens... but really, the game would suck if a one-shot was a given for rails that hit target.

Robocraft,3bn0dc,buildzoid,3,Wed Jul 1 02:46:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly, atm the one shot is difficult to get how it should be, I don't want to see rails get any weaker or stronger, I feel there are right on it."
Robocraft,3bn0dc,Khoakuma,2,Wed Jul 1 03:06:04 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. If they make rails weaker now, they would be way inferior to SMGs, even if SMGs are made weaker too, because Rails need to kill before the victim can escape behind eg a mountain. With an SMG tank you can simply follow the guy and the battle continues. But as a Sniper you can't follow him anymore. I score pretty much the same amount of kills with my rail bot as with my SMG bot and if rails were made weaker, that wouldn't be the case any more."

Robocraft,3bo9ei,Stigawub,6,Tue Jun 30 20:31:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry to burst you hype bubble, but this is what Mark said in the forums:  Great concept. Definitely not completely thought out and people keep pointing out issues and potential solutions. Just to give my personal two cents, unrelating to any work I’ve actually done on the game, but solely with what I know about game development in general.  I’ll begin with the negative bits that people are going to hate on me for.  Starting out, as people have pointed out, calculating all of this on the fly is very difficult. Simulating it physically is just out of the question, especially not involving any sort of collision. You’d just have a weapon that can clip through your own bot/other bits of your bot/terrain, and when it’s in an invalid state, firing does nothing. That’s fair enough, essentially ‘cook’ the animations by pre-calculating all of its possible states.  However, that’s not as simple as it sounds. Enough joints and you run into a large number of states you have to cook before-hand, which means a bunch of waiting while it’s simulated. But even that’s not enough, those animations have to be processed by the server (validated, which is something you don’t want the server to be doing during its battle setup phase), sent to all of the clients, everyone has to store everyone else’s animations. And this is ignoring collisions, if you added collisions you’d end up having to set up an inverse kinematics system which would then wreak havoc what with latency and minor desyncs.  What’s more, what is the gain of the system? I mean, yes, it looks brilliant. I’d love it if the guns looked like that, but gameplay-wise, would you want to have to design something like this?  In the very rare case it would be a benefit gameplay-wise, it’ll be such a minor effect that it won’t matter in a battle, and in most cases new players will just have to search for a good design and then copy paste it without understanding why it works. And those that won’t do this will get annoyed because they don’t understand why it’s not working, because a hinge-joint setup for a complex system is never going to be intuitive for the average person.  This is why even niche games like Besieged and the like are very simple, and more importantly focused on that aspect. You don’t play Besieged to build a robot to fight a match, you build it specifically to play with that sort of system.  I sincerely believe in reducing games to their base mechanics, and then only adding things when they have a tangible benefit. I believe this even more strongly for a competitive multiplayer game, where ideally you want a ‘perfect’, or close to perfect, design.  For the flip side of the coin, I would wholeheartedly approve of this feature being a thing in a hypothetical ‘artbot’ setup, like the Hub. I would enjoy in the Hub, which is specifically for showing off your bot, having the option to modify the normal SMG setup to have it become a twin turret, or a quad turret, or an arm-mounted laser from a mech arm, etc.  So long as the game mode is specifically set up for things like this (collisions mostly off, or not relevant), and so long as the server can take as long as it needs to process and send the data to everyone, I think it’s fine, but also a lot of work for a solely artistic thing.  tldr; I think it’s a great graphical thing that would be maybe useful in an artistic setting, but it’s not something that should go anywhere near actual Robocraft gameplay because it’s: unintuitive to build, unintuitive to control (tracking speed will no longer be constant), extremely hard to program in a way that is both secure and fast to process server and client-side."

Am I the only person who started playing this game because the trailers (and specifically the joints on the cover bot) made it seem complex? If I wanted a simple game I wouldnt play a game that allowed me to change every single design aspect of my vehicle. I tried WoT. It wasnt that fun, driving around shooting stuff wasnt the thing that attracted me, it was the idea that I could build a flying toilet and literally shit on stuff with it.

And AA as you say I also want to play RC because I want to tinker with my bots and iterate on their design. I like the building process equally much as the actual fighting and I put a lot of time and thought into a bot. But it seems RC is heading towards the please-the-stupid-casual path which saddens me.

Robocraft,3bo9ei,TheAero1221,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:36:05 2015 UTC,"Could potentially solve a few problems by only 'cooking' full turret collision box ahead of time to obtain min/max angles of operation. Limit number of potential axis to 2, to keep designs simple. Limit number of potential 'turret' structures (any structure that uses rotary joints) to 6. Disallow movement parts on joint segments, only shields, cubes, and stationary guns are allowed on joint segments. On the client side, treat each joint segment like a different entity or sub-bot. Using provided information like coordinates relative to the main body of the bot, and min/max angles of movement and bot/cursor direction, the client could work with these sub-bot entities to generate a piece-wise image of other players' bots. The server would send the info regarding these sub-bots (including their min/max angles of movement, and their coordinates relative to the main bot), at the beginning of the match. If you have questions or arguments regarding this approach I'd love to hear them. The best way to tackle a tough problem is to talk it out with people."

Before the downvotes start rolling in, we know it takes a fully fledged Tier 10 bot to move into Tier 10 as a medic. You need full robo ranking with plenty of guns and Tier 10 components to break the robo ranking barrier. With an smg, the person only needs T9 points and can enter the battle like that, especially if gun rushing.

Unless he gunrushed t10 using the only weapon possible (SMG) and bought a nano gun with tp and rp, and entered a battle with just that, there's a good chance the person just doesn't like the changes and wants to ruin his team by barely making the requirements and entering a very bad medic."

The higher up you are the more likely you are to be seen. But be careful to avoid going to low, SMG tanks are stronger the closer you are to them. Cover up your wings and rudders the best you can, and be careful not to connect all of your wings to a single block.  Also if you see a red lazer, do whatever you can to keep it off of you, that's a rail lazer and they are made to pierce through bot's like a hot knife through butter. They excel in ANTI air and can probably rip through any armor you use to cover your wings if they know where they are.   Redundancy is a huge must for flying unit's. Primarily wings/ rudders. Anything you can use to help keep you in the air. It will get harder to control if you become lopsided though... So long as you can guarantee yourself a way back to base your set.   Also one tip for all your bot's, but is especially important for flying unit's. Use two tetra's beneath your seat pointing away from each other. It'll help keep you from being a one shot wonder.. Put a decent layer of armor bellow your seat though."

I don't go full on triforce try had usually but this alone add's stupid amount's of survivability. I had accidentally forgot to do with with a copter I had and it was incredible how quickly you get taken out of the sky... rail it's near your seat, and BOOM! Damage reroutes through the next cube and you dead son.   This is all part of triforcing, aka Damage redirection. Damage will prefer going the route of connecting blocks, but using tricks like the prism seat prism split can have a huge impact on how your bot performs.  But be careful though.  you can't dead end damage and if the damage has no place to go it will jump to the next place it can.   Triforcing one of the more advanced techniques and takes time and practice to get into... And for me personally It's a lil bit tooooo min maxy. I get by well enough without it, but for a unit using wing's it's probably going to be more crucial. Not only does it help survivability when done right, but it can cut down on weight."
Robocraft,3bodfe,ThunderLuigi,3,Tue Jun 30 22:34:57 2015 UTC,"Ooh a fledgling bomber pilot, I see? I've a few tips for you:     Always practice leading your targets from far away. Hop in practice mode and shoot at everything that moves from far away. Initially, the rangefinding-style crosshair will help you out in getting to know how far shots land from what altitude. With enough practice and games under your belt, you'll have this down to instinct. Additionally, although not so much an issue at this time, learn the timing of the plasma cannons. It changes as you go up in clock levels and with the number of cannons you have. Airshots and pursuing air targets are also a good thing to practice. This is significantly harder in the sense that the only situations for this are when you're against other flyers. Interceptors (SMG flyers), rail copters in higher tiers, and other bombers above you want your blood so being able to defend yourself in the sky is a major plus. Learn to fly crippled. When you're satisfied with a build, take off a random wing or thruster or two and try flying with that. That way, you'll identify which situations are salvageable enough to be healed back at base or by medics in later tiers, and which ones leave you S.O.L. I haven't done this personally but I heard this helps some. Everything else /u/KillaJoke mentioned. All good stuff."

Adjust the  robot ranking to allow an average robot with 80% on tier components to tier up (the first thing he is going to unlock in the new tier are the weapons). Increase the rp rewards in the low tiers to allow the new players enough cash to build anything they want. This could be done giving them some days of free premium when they start.      With those changes new players would be forced to build stronger robots to tier up and they will have enough rp to build  and experiment different weapons and movement parts: they would die less and have more fun."

They have all the incentives to tiering up atm but nothing to really gate it DESPITE HAVING A COMPLETELY DIFFRENT SYSTEM THAT YOU ACCUMULATE TOO MUCH OF TO BEGIN WITH!  Just one or two matches in the new battle mode can net you the TP to grab a few next tier part's before armor.   You don't have time or reason to stay in the lower tiers. You're not making the same RP as the next tier up, Their system is all about grind and the best way to grind is to tier up in the first place.  But actually gating the rate at which you rank up and can build bot's for the higher tiers is what need's to happen. Hitting RP and TP at the same time just put's us back at square one. We need a clear cut tip in one direction and I feel TP is what need's change in order to tip the scales.   Give them time to grind up armor blocks, keep the current rate so you aren't buying blocks 3 at a time like you were before and make it harder to buy that one gun for Tier +.  Even if you manage to buy a gun and get knocked up a tier, if you have armor and a decently built up bot you are atleast set up well with on tier gear. But their should be a big gap between the gun's and the movement part's TP wise aswell..."

Robocraft,3bm37u,Mtax,4,Wed Jul 1 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"Progression needs to be a hard limitation   I highly disagree with this. Robocraft is not a game of progression. It has progression but it's far from the core of the game. I reached T10 around 200-250 hours yet I'm still here. If progression was the end goal I wouldn't be playing right now.   People hate limitations yet when you progress you are limited, hard. That can be an extreme turn off. I know I hated my experienced tiering up because I was fighting so many factors. I had to deal with CPU limitations, Tier parameters, low RP rewards, TP grind, and finally fighting people who dropped to a lower tier. Throughout my entire journey all I wanted was to finally get to T10 and level 100 so I could build the bots that I wanted to.   This is a game of building bots, tweaking them, finding interesting combinations, seeing what works, and using your imagination. All those things I rarely got to experience because I didn't have the breathing room required until I hit T10 where the RP was reasonable and the level grind was easier. Lets not cloud ourselves due to a few veterans complaining wanting longer progression because they 'feel' it should be.   While I don't think the progression is really a problem I don't like how the system is determined now. I think Cebeide is on the right course. Allow new players more freedom in what they build but also push them towards something good. It's going to be very hard to manage as more limitations is not good. We want to encourage players waiting to advance in the next tier with confidence with a decent bot.   One option could be the garage bay. In order to advance the next tier your bay must be its respected tier or higher. Make this in the tech tree with a fairly large TP cost. They would be universal across all bays and a permanent upgrade. Perhaps make it only available after the user has already invested in 4-5 next tier upgrades. Once they buy the garage it will get slightly bigger until it's the size of the Megabay in T10. This will also get rid of the stupid Megabay requirement so players can build their first mega with decency. However this is just a ballpark idea."

Earn battle funds for performance - whenever you do better than average for the game, you get an amount determined by your standard deviation from the norm, with a handicap factor based on your bot's robot ranking.  Tier would be decimal.  X.Y - X would be your tier, Y your fractional tier. Your CPU limit would be based on the tier range and your fractional tier rating.  No more tech points.  You would unlock tech with RP.  I don't see any reason to have them separate since purchases would be controlled by your level. For match making purposes, I'd allow anyone within 1.0 robot ranks of each other to be in the same battle.  All 8.x is fine, but so would be a mix of 7.3 - 8.3.  (I'd have RR on the same scale as player level)   I would set the progression so you'd have to perform over average for 20 (new meta) games to get to the next level, maybe 40 Classic games.  By the time you get to T10, you'd have had to play a minimum of 200 games better than average... that would have to improve the player skill levels."

Robocraft,3bm37u,PacoBedejo,2,Tue Jun 30 13:21:33 2015 UTC,"There's currently two ways to teir up, Robot Ranking and CPU. It looks like they way they are balanced is you mainly level through RR, but you could also just play and increase your level to get to the next teir through CPU. The ability to teir without getting new components (i.e. CPU) is compensated though by Armor Restrictions.  To me it was a bit confusing starting out that I had a ""level"" that had nothing to do with the teir of my robot. Now it has some impact on teir, but it's a bit hidden. Robot ranking alone was a pretty straight forward method and when I was gaining teirs, I just built small overteired robots to compensate for the lack of cpu (with weapons paid for with UberTP).   Instead of using Player Level as an alternate way to teir up, it could be used to control teir progression. There could be a hard min and max cpu for each teir that requires player level to progress. Then you could make level progression slower again because instead of the current issue with low levels in high tiers, it wouldn't be possible. The current fix to low levels in high teirs is to increase level progression, but that effectively increases teir progression.  This way it would be possible to directly adjust teir progression without having to alter Robot Ranking and TP/RP.  So in summary, teir is defined by:   Teir Robot Ranking Teir Armor Class (T-1)' CPU >= Teir min CPU <= Teir max (hard cap, doesn't bump Teir)   Your robot would have a teir progression bar on the bottom and possibly add the other qualifiers. The primary stat would be robot ranking, so when you don't meet the other requirements for that RR Teir it shows an error with a message how to fix it for battle.  The downside of this is that you cannot make smaller builds, which are pointless anyways with the removal of overteiring. Just leave the gaps wide, maybe keep the ~500 cpu range that you get starting in T1. Apparently smaller builds are a problem atm with the RR boost that weapons got, so maybe this is two birds with one stone."
Robocraft,3bm37u,BrogarVolant,2,Tue Jun 30 15:02:05 2015 UTC,"I think the best solution would be to allow for Tier +1 in all tiers.

Robocraft,3bm37u,cebeide,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:35:20 2015 UTC,Adding limits is the only way to slow progression.  Adding a minimum level requirement doesn't introduce any general building restrictions though.

Robocraft,3bm37u,IsilZha,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the overtiering restriction. However, 1 t10 gun and some white cubes now puts you into t10. My idea counter to that would be to add a minimum robo rank for a tier. This would require investing a fair amount of RP into the next tier's parts before you could move up. This would require more on-tier play which would in turn slow down progress. A starting minimum value could be about 6 weapons worth of robo rank. As long as that minimum could also be met with something like 3 guns and movement parts, for those that choose to play smaller bots."
Robocraft,3bm37u,DwarvesAtWork,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:47:50 2015 UTC,"Since /u/Drognin is reading this thread, and there's more to be said than can fit in a tweet, I'll post here instead of twitter.  The progression in Robocraft serves as an introduction to the game's mechanics (through tech tree unlocks), and a learning curve for new players. As such, the time spent getting to T10 only needs to be enough time to learn all the basics of construction, combat, and the social interaction systems of Robocraft (this last one is often overlooked in game progression, but is equally important). T10 is the maximum tier to unlock all gameplay features, and is the point at which the ""hard to master"" part of ""easy to learn, hard to master"" should be present.  The current system of providing weapons before armour in the tech tree is good because it keeps bouts short. Doing it the other way around (armour before weapons) will increase the bouts' duration. Short bouts are better than longer ones as they provide more variety to the player in the same amount of time as a longer bout; i.e. moving on to the next bout with different opponents or terrain, or refining their robot design, or any number of other things to do in Robocraft, sooner. Providing enough variety to avoid boredom or stagnation is a worthwhile goal to seek in order to keep players interested, and play sessions to a reasonable length.  Currently, the CPU cap based on tier makes leveling redundant (unless their's something other than CPU cap that level effects, correct me if I'm wrong). If the CPU cap is staying (which is my preference), then leveling should be removed or repurposed.  If the current progression is too fast, then reducing the number of TP earned will slow progression. Increasing the TP cost of cubes in the tech tree will have the same effect. Changing how much TP is earned to be more strongly influenced by your score from a bout will also allow people who learn quickly to progress faster than those who are having a harder time picking up the mechanics and gameplay. This would also give slower learners more time to master the mechanics as they are introduced through the tech tree. During my progression from T1 to T10, I found that the thing inhibiting my progression was RP earned, not TP (I have/had several thousand more TP than I'll ever need at lower tiers).  I think RP earned over the course of an entire tier should match what is necessary to build an effective bot for the NEXT tier, up to the CPU cap for that tier, excepting tier 1, which should reward enough RP to build an effective bot to the CPU cap of that tier as well as the next. In this way, a player will have the resources necessary to build the best bot they can think of for the tier they're entering into, without having to spend their first few matches losing with an ineffective or budget bot in order to earn the RP to build the best bot they can think of within the tier's CPU cap. This RP gain can be balanced out by the TP progression changes I have outlined; i.e. you can increase the amount of RP earned and time spent in a tier by increasing the TP costs of tech available at that tier as more TP required to tier up means more matches played and more RP earned. The RP earned from selling robot components should be also be considered to be a part of the RP earned, as this encourages the learning and use of the selling mechanic to speed up progression and the purchase of desired components.  Minimising the gap in cube cost between tiers will also help reduce the amount of RP necessary to progress to the next tier with a decent robot build, as well as allowing the reduction of the amount of rewarded RP from bouts as the cubes already owned by the player are worth more of the next tiers cubes when sold.  Conversely; the less RP earned, and the bigger the gap of cube cost is between tiers, the more grinding must be done by the player to progress, and the higher the incentive to progress with a budget bot becomes. Grinding for RP has more value at T10 where the variety of components and opponents is greater. Experimentation of robot design (and thus RP spent on components) is more likely to be done at T10, as less time (or none at all) is being dedicated to tech tree progression.  However, RP earned at T10 is less valuable to people who do not have spare garage slots, as they will instead be recycling cubes to make new bot designs and reusing their existing garage slots. Allowing garage slots to be bought with a large amount of RP will allow for a greater spending of RP at T10, as well as removing that RP from the economy (which will be more important if/when trading or an auction house exists ingame; inflation is an MMO economy killer). Also of note is that RP sinks are not necessary at, and become detrimental to, any level of progression below the maximum.  Another point about the RP and TP disparity is that, if someone loses a bout, but they've got some ideas on how to improve their robot design to do better next time, they should be given the RP to do so. In the current system, our hypothetical player must grind through several losing bouts, after the first, before they have the RP with which to improve their robot with their new ideas. Such a player should not be able to progress to the next tier so easily, until they've learned how to use the mechanics of their current tier to their advantage. As I have noted above; TP should be the ruler by which tier progression is measured, not RP. Thus the RP earned from a bout should be less influenced by a players score during that bout than it currently is, in order to encourage their adaptation and learning through altering or rebuilding their robot(s). This change to RP's relation to score is less important at T10, but more important at those tiers which introduce new game mechanics through the tech tree.  Kudos to you if you have read this entire essay."

The reason is the feeding filth leaking into t10 is getting far too heavy to carry especially since I start the game 2 minutes late and can't use rails at all thanks to shitty Vietnamese internet... I really want to defend new people and have been doing that for the past few weeks, but the past couple of days when the enemy rail/ smg tank/ plasma chopter reach OC 10 in <6 minutes is getting really, really stupid. The worst thing is since -1 armor is apparently too expensive many is resorting to small 'tactical builds' of electroplates that drop like trash to plasma and rails (no offense to the people who can actually build good ones, electroplates scales hard on the right hand)... which I despise so, so much."

Robocraft,3bk1q7,bobrob48,16,Mon Jun 29 22:13:06 2015 UTC,"FJ had performance issues with Rotating blocks (or whatever they tested), the game does seem to chug more when players cluster together in engagements, which would be worsened by adding more physics/graphics calcs to the equation. For the benefits, which are purely cosmetic, on an engine that isn't that fond of physics to begin with, I just don't see why FJ would consider it viable to add to the game. At least not until the engine or APIs have improved to decrease the potential impact it could have, or if there was evidence to suggest that it would significantly improve gameplay in some way."
Robocraft,3bk1q7,TDuffin,7,Mon Jun 29 22:54:38 2015 UTC,I agree. I am against adding fluff. I rather they add more robots per fight or bigger robots with more blocks.
Robocraft,3bk1q7,DumberMonkey,2,Mon Jun 29 23:03:46 2015 UTC,It's an unfortunate reality of free-to-play games:  The majority of the player base is going to be on potatoes.  Kind of a double-edged blade if you think about it though-  At least all those potato-gamers give you lots of people to play the game with.

It's less boring than sitting in a circle, and it allows you to cap at a distance instead of going right into the enemy base. Aside from that, I would like if all those things were added."
Robocraft,3bk1q7,malum-panem,2,Tue Jun 30 02:21:31 2015 UTC,Crystals aren't that awful and it is better than sitting in a circle that's true.  Three towers is a huge improvement over four and that helped. But the enjoyment they add varies with bot design and map position. I'd be happy if they healed though without a shield.   They don't really fit in with the theme and style of robocraft. They are really basic in design and super vague. Are they pylons? Mining beacons? Fuel rod thingys?  I was fine with warring robots in a wasteland but now we have metal robo trees?    Considering the time spent developing them I would of much rather had more weapon and movement options. Supposedly they were also the reason team size had to go down due to performance issues.

I also have to agree with /u/goldstarsstickergiver in the fact that it adds strategy to the game."
Robocraft,3bk1q7,Trey5169,2,Tue Jun 30 12:55:32 2015 UTC,"yeah, I still like robocraft but what originally got me in to the game was the super fast games and just lots and lots of fighting.   Rather than go this direction I wish they had just focused on tightening up the physics, maps, the communications and movement types. I thought it was going to be a mechwarrior-ksp mashup.  I'm not really that keen on mobas."

They're totally viable for the HUB/PIT modes that FJ is adding to encourage art bots that wouldn't be allowed in normal meta matches. Hell, perhaps eventually (if the player count doesn't nosedive) FJ will see it viable to add a ""casual"" meta gamemode and a ""competitive"" meta gamemode, which are identical in all ways to the current standard battle, but one allows more sizes/block variety/art bots and the other has the balance restrictions in place."

Robocraft,3bm7kv,patrykK1028,4,Tue Jun 30 10:15:02 2015 UTC,"The problem dont necessarily lies in the rotors, but on the connection to the rotor.  The likely scenario is enemy damage hitting the armor under your rotors, the damage spread and destroy all of the connecting cubes, destroying the rotor prematurely.  The goal is to isolate the damage going around the base of the rotor, leading it all the way back to an damage sink, a much more heavily armored area of your bot.  Instead of making solid connection into the rotors, seperate it, make it into armor rods, and maybe also using aerorods to condense the armor. You want to make it as difficult as possible to destroy one of your rotor, either the enemy have to deal terrible terrible damage, burning through all of the rotor's HP, or sniping off every single connecting bar/rods, which will make your rotors much more durable. http://imgur.com/CgkKos1 This is a very crude replica of your bot, which I show the same rotor configuration , but with different styled connecting points."

I don't want to hear about someone putting their dick in a person, regardless of the dickee's gender, gender expression, lack of gender or expression, or whatever other thing you decide I'm afraid of because it doesn't belong in a fucking videogame about robots.  Can that bullshit, and save it for your circlejerk (also NOT a sexual reference).  Bottom line is, there shouldn't be a flag for sexual preference, especially one that specifically excludes one of them. That's actually discriminatory, as opposed to saying ""no sex stuff, please"". Personally, I don't have a problem with rainbow flags, I think they should be allowed under user-created flags instead of their own item, however."

The more the message gets out there, the more the tide of public opinion will change, and if that means flags in robocraft might help turn the tide in places like Russia then we should be doing it, because fuck your concept of 'this doesn't belong in a game', putting it in the game could prevent someone being fired, based or murdered in the real world, in that context your rustled jimmies seem quite pathetic."

Don't put that shit in my robot game, either. Just robots blasting the shit out of each other, that's what I'm here for.   You want to have a game that does the things you're talking about? MAKE a game about gay/les/trans/bestial/whatever, and you can totally put robots in your game about gay/les/etc. Hell, I'd probably play that game, but to my knowledge, that game doesn't exist (yet), but objectively, that game is NOT Robocraft.   Robocraft is a game about (gender-indiscriminate, and in fact, gender-blind) people building robots to blast each other. It is not a platform for sexual rights. Be gay and play. Be les and play. Be one while dressed as the other while you play - nobody cares. If you keep pushing (lol) to put sex, sex-related, and sexually natured things (yes, gender-based messages are sex related, because that's what sex is {not just an act}) into an otherwise neutral environment, you're GOING to draw hate, and hate speech in-game.

Okay so perhaps we should remove flags all together? Because politically speaking, you are supporting another country other than FJ home.  I say that if adding a flag has no negative impact other than people whining, then add it. Let the people support what they want, as long as it doesn't negatively impact the game.  Black people had to go through a life of slavery, if you're proud to be a black person, and you're happy that society is advancing, then sure add a flag for specifically them. Perhaps not the black panther, but whatever.  Flags are easily ignored, and people will use them for more than just showing they're ""gay and proud"". Nyan Cat, people use the Humble Bundle for Medic.  Considering that the confederate flag is seen as racist, no.  The point of added a rainbow flag is that the States have /FINALLY/ decreed that Gay Marriage is available everywhere. This is a huge step. Just because you want to ignore progress, doesn't mean it should be ignored.  The fact that it's mainly just a rainbow, and that you're annoyed by this, should mean nothing."

Until Freejam fixes that, you won't see this behavior change."
Robocraft,3bjlhn,Stigawub,6,Mon Jun 29 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"One of the big issues I can see is that Teslas are in fact re-usable -- you just have to find a medic to heal them back up, which IMO encourages teamwork.   But I see what you're saying. You want a grindy blade that never goes away. Which makes sense. Something to mount on the front of a tank to make it more useful in melee than a one-time Teslasplosion of damage allows.  The other big issue I can see is that most of your drawbacks (as listed) aren't drawbacks for tanks, the vehicle this would see the most use on. Slow down other vehicles? Sure. Heavy? I can handle it. Can be shot off? Everything can be shot off.  ""Large"" is actually a useful drawback, as it forces some interesting decisions regarding firing angles when constructing your bot. If, instead of a sawblade, we make it a big fat scoop full of woodchipper blades that sits on the front of your robot and grinds down things you run into, cutting off firing angles and using valuable space, that might be a useful drawback.  Thoughts?"
Robocraft,3bjlhn,Radiophage,4,Mon Jun 29 19:47:21 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, and thanks for reading and responding. When I do look at it I see that this is a very tank tread oriented idea. While I still like my idea of the look of a big ass gear tank tearing other tanks in half, I think your ""wood chipper"" seems like a better version for the game. The only problem with your design is that the chipper might not stick out of a bot enough to reach another bot with treads or blocks in the way."
Robocraft,3bjlhn,Reikaosu,3,Mon Jun 29 19:53:44 2015 UTC,"Well, it would depend on how you mount it. Assuming it's about the same size (t10) as say... two to three teslas stacked on top of each other, with about the same hitbox Teslas would have in that situation, it would work. Just make it more like a set of three grinder wheels, like you'd use to polish steel and stuff when black smithing? Three of them, a wide middle one and two shorter ones at 45 degree angles to the sides would work. Also, your concerns about it not sticking out enough? Been there done that with Teslas anyway. You just need to build smart."
Robocraft,3bjlhn,NotHomo,3,Mon Jun 29 20:01:36 2015 UTC,"i think teslas are already a very effective melee weapon.  to put it succinctly damage over time SUCKS.  teslas work because they do their damage instantly.  if you took teslas and made them do damage over time they would suck.  nanos are basically damage over time and they SUCK, not only because they do crap damage but because the hitboxing in this game is the most wonky thing imaginable and you're never doing the damage you should be doing  iunno, i just think that teslas are so well implemented currently that there's not much room for something else that does basically the same thing but over time..."
Robocraft,3bjlhn,radyjko,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"Let's say Teslas are the melee version of rails. They do instant extreme damage and are pretty easy to use.

I think having a reusable damaging over time Melee weapon would be a nice alternative to Teslas."

Robocraft,3bjlhn,mitit1001,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:41:04 2015 UTC,"That's the point, you can't randomly charge at enemies without it getting shot off. You would have to use some semblance of strategy and try to flank or attack enemies that are either unaware of you or have no weapons to counter it."
Robocraft,3bjlhn,MorrisCasper,2,Mon Jun 29 20:44:03 2015 UTC,"heh, either my team or their team would be almost dead by the time i go around them to flank them xD Its just too heavy to transport."
Robocraft,3bjlhn,Zrakkur,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:44:00 2015 UTC,"If you flank them, why not give them the tesla surprise? If you want the weapon to be a mainly ambushy tactic, I don't see the reason for it anymore. Teslas seem to do a better job at that."
Robocraft,3bjlhn,TheGUURAHK,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:08:12 2015 UTC,Teslas are an instant boom and you're done. The grinder could sneak up and tear the whole team apart if nobody notices you. Teslas also don't do a lot of damage to megas (unless you have 10 of them). The grinder could get the mega without him knowing what's going on.
Robocraft,3bjlhn,DumberMonkey,2,Thu Jul 2 08:57:38 2015 UTC,I prefer a ram idea:  Large block that can be mounted on the front of the bot (only can face the same direction as the wheels/treads/wings. Not recommended for use with rotors). Deals damage based on speed upon contact with an enemy bot.  Pros:  Tanky as all hell. This thing ain't coming off.  Can deal insane amounts of damage at high speeds  Encourages builds based on flanking at speed  Cons:  Relies on charging an enemy directly  Clunky and awkward to place on a bot  Probably going to be the only weapon on a flier
Robocraft,3bjlhn,mitit1001,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:21:54 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for the other melee weapon to be like blade arms. Right click swings an arm, and the more arms you have, the shorter the delay between each swing. Caps out at 4.  Pros: Great DPS and reasonably tanky  Cons: No zoom, heavy, big, and CPU eater."

Robocraft,3birvu,Onceuponaban,4,Mon Jun 29 17:37:53 2015 UTC,Bot type recognition in general has been drunk for a while now.

Robocraft,3bl8xf,TollBoothW1lly,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:21:14 2015 UTC,I had to rebuild my T-7 plasma bomber to keep it on T-7 with the new meta. This thing rocks early to mid game. Late game the SMGs start hitting hard enough that I have to be careful to run away before I take too much damage. There are a lot of bots I can sneak up on and just delete off the map with one shot.
Robocraft,3bjoi9,MutatedPixel808,7,Mon Jun 29 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"Even if your vehicle is composed largely of T3 parts and T0 armor, you are using far too much CPU for T3.  The update also introduced a CPU cap, which means robots in lower tiers can only use so much CPU before being bumped into the next tier. If your goal is for this bot to be T3, you must reduce its CPU usage down to 750 or lower.  The change notes have a small table showing the CPU caps per tier. Unfortunately this soft cap is pretty much hidden fron new players, which is poor design IMO. This limit should be explicitly stated to players building their robots, so they can at least know bigger bots aren't allowed in lower tiers."
Robocraft,3bjoi9,X-wing9,3,Mon Jun 29 20:17:22 2015 UTC,"Ok thank you, now i get it, that makes a lot of sense. :)"
Robocraft,3bjoi9,DumberMonkey,2,Mon Jun 29 20:25:08 2015 UTC,"They should make it obvious the CPU limit. I had to go to T5 with some friends to help someone up the ranks. They thought there was CPU limits..but it showed the total CPU. I told them, well you will simply go to the next tier if you cross the limit for that tier.  They should make this obvious in the building screen.  What I do is put my guns on the floor while building.  So I know to stop adding blocks when I am about to cross the tier threshold."

Robocraft,3bjoi9,TDuffin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:17:23 2015 UTC,"But you also can't queue like that due to the armor restrictions. Personally I think CPU should be a hard cap and not push you up, but I think it's not too bad this way either with the armor restrictions."
Robocraft,3bjoi9,DeepMidWicket,2,Mon Jun 29 19:59:13 2015 UTC,Currently people are getting confused because FJ hasn't added these caps into the game. It should let you know that adding X block you bump you into the next tier due to the CPU limit (or full-on prevent it if it'd put you out of the T-1 armour restriction) so players understand why their bots are surpassing X tier. At level 100 it's hard to make bots for lower tiers if I have to keep referencing patch notes to make sure I don't surpass CPU limits.

I made a statement that sealclubbing made me stronger, but that doesn't mean that I support it. I'm glad these changes exist now, as I'm suddenly in T9 with 80 levels under my belt, when it was 69 the week prior. I can jump into battle and not piss on about how the guy with the overtiered guns killed me and instead piss on about how I was outplayed.

Frankly, I feel that it's perfectly fair for the devs to take radical changes into the air at this stage, and if anything, I see Robocraft rapidly growing, as a game.  I seriously think that people shouldn't feel too entitled about anything in a game where practically EVERYTHING could change at a moment's notice. By playing an alpha game, you basically agree that what you have in your hands are incomplete and could be reworked on various degrees.  Now, do I find the latest update bad? I can't comment on that since I hardly OT or seal club, BUT I do feel that matches pits bots of almost equal resources, leading to fairer match... if you don't take the matchmaking that puts 3 medics on the enemy team and none of your own, that is.

It is incredibly valuable. Effective spotting equals effective grouping and flanking, which is required in order to win."
Robocraft,3bhimv,Radiophage,2,Mon Jun 29 14:50:58 2015 UTC,"Also, in Standard Battle, spotting an enemy gives you the RP/TP bonus every time they respawn. If you spot them for the first time after they spawn, that counts the same as if you spotted the same guy the first time you get into a match.  It's so valuable, especially if you can spot a group heading for an unprotected tower. You can normally focus a rail or a bomber onto the advancing units before they can take a tower for free. Also helps when an enemy flyer is fucking you shit up. As an SMG at times, I feel no greater joy than hearing SARA say ""plasma bomber spotted""."
Robocraft,3bhimv,TDuffin,2,Mon Jun 29 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"In addition, anyone who has been spotted will be notified by a red exclamation point under their crosshair and a ping-like sound.  So if this has been happening to you constantly and don't know what the hell is going on, now you know.  Also good to know that spotting people may give YOU away as well and may cause rail spiders to move into cover."
Robocraft,3bhimv,Chevleon_,2,Mon Jun 29 22:10:27 2015 UTC,I once joined a match and forgot to put one of my rotors back on my bot. plus a t10 thruster. my bot was sluggish and hard to fly but some how I was able to still get 5 kills and 6 deaths. not a bad ratio for a handicapped flying tank.
Robocraft,3bhimv,TDuffin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:05:20 2015 UTC,I once forgot all my rear rudders/aerofoils (I was testing another flyer and couldn't be arsed to farm RP for it). Not being able to get off the ground as a flyer doesn't make you very effective :(

Robocraft,3bkhzl,Juvar23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:18:31 2015 UTC,It flies very well even with only one rotor because all of the thrusters are spaced close to the same distance from the rotor and the weight is pretty evenly distributed. However I mostly spend my time scooting along the ground. It moves very quickly this way and if I lose my rotor the thrusters make it like a thruster stick and I am easily able to make it back to the shield.   Edit: If you could also please rate on robocraft garage I would greatly appreciate it :)

Robocraft,3bfqwj,cooffee,17,Sun Jun 28 20:50:25 2015 UTC,In my experience all the surrender votes have been launched when everyone are still in OC 4-6 and everything can happen.

Loss is imminent. No point in surrendering.  Most of the surrender votes I see are when the enemy team does an early 3 cap and does some damage to reactor... Surrender vote pops up, I go kill the 2-3 weak ass bots on our reactor, then I go cap 2 towers back and I'm OC 8 and we're back in the game.  The surrender button is fucking pointless.  IF you're losing SO bad that there's no coming back, then your reactor should be coming down within the next minute or two anyway.  IF you're not losing that bad, then there's still a chance you could come back and double your RP/TP/XP.  Personally, I fucking hate being in games with people like you. You're the type of person who gives up as soon as something doesn't go your way. As soon as anything presents a challenge, you're like ""NOPE I'M OUT..""  The only way you get any better at any game (or anything in life) is by having your back against a wall."
Robocraft,3bfqwj,NotHomo,-6,Mon Jun 29 00:03:38 2015 UTC,cool we'll wait till you're in the game where the enemy is just flying around your spawn points instakilling anyone that spawns and ignoring your base for 20 minutes  surrender pointless eh? idiot
Robocraft,3bfqwj,Aetherimp,4,Mon Jun 29 04:29:31 2015 UTC,"While it's feasible that COULD happen and in that SINGLE case it would be appropriate to surrender, I can honestly say I've never had that happen to me.  Of course, no point in arguing with you."
Robocraft,3bfqwj,NotHomo,-4,Mon Jun 29 04:42:57 2015 UTC,there's respect for your enemy as well.  when you KNOW you're going to lose and spare the enemy the wasted time going through the motions  or are you the type of person who sees the checkmate 4 moves ahead and plays the game out anyways instead of just tipping the king?
Robocraft,3bfqwj,Aetherimp,4,Mon Jun 29 04:57:38 2015 UTC,"No, but that's Chess, a 1v1 game where I know all of my options. Same in Age of Empires.. If I was against an Ottoman and I couldn't shut down their early rush, I knew my eco was too far behind to catch up, so I would spare both of us the long drawn out game and just resign.   In team games, (almost) anything can happen. Just because something looks bleak from your standpoint doesn't mean there isn't someone on your team who knows that if they can do X thing then they can make Y thing happen which will tip the odds in your teams favor.  You play League of Legends, right? How many times have you played a late game champ, got stomped early game, just to come back and dominate in team fights, take objectives, and win? Happens all the time. Robocraft is a team game, and there are certain bots/players who are capable of turning the game in your favor."

Robocraft,3bfqwj,Aetherimp,2,Mon Jun 29 12:57:30 2015 UTC,Nope. In League I'd generally agree to surrender if we started losing team fights and objectives after laning phase.
Robocraft,3bfqwj,NinteenFortyFive,0,Mon Jun 29 13:10:59 2015 UTC,I suspect you define the whole game as Laning phase because both Nexuses are at the end of them.

You defend leavers in another thread, and you defend surrendering.   You're horrible and you leave games and surrender because your fragile ego can't handle someone else being better than you and you're too unimaginative and lack the balls to rise to the occasion and GET GOOD, so you quit instead. You're a coward. As long as you have that mentality, you'll always be a shit player. Hope you enjoy getting farmed for RP."

Cap towers, explode the reactor, not necessarily in that order.  Tank and gunbed builds are good, but they're built for firepower and/or durability. These are properties of defensive units, which means winning with them takes so long as it takes ages for them to creep across the map.  Where the mobile builds win, is not by confronting the enemy, but avoiding them, staying out of the dogpiles, and base rushing for the win!

Over time that bot became a heavy tank that packed a lot of armor and redundant guns so I could stay on the front lines and let people sneak around. I use a lot of other types of builds now too, such as the ever hated plasma bomber, SMG copters, interceptors, and SMG walkers and none of those builds would be effective if there wasn't a tank soaking up the damage and keeping the enemy occupied while I blew them to pieces.   Honestly, I think tanks require the most skill to play, since you're a large, slow, highly exposed object that has to fight multiple targets at once. They have to know where to go to let their teams do what they need to do. Sure, anyone can play a tank, but it requires skill and strategy to use a heavy tank well.  If everyone was a ""special ops"" craft, then no one would be a special op craft. We'd have a bunch of lightly armored hovers that zip around the map and face other lightly armored hovers (I have nothing against hovers). The whole reason those ""special ops"" craft are special is because the majority of the players in a match are a tank and can't perform that role. But if everyone is special, no one is."

Check this out: https://www.reddit.com/r/Robocraft/comments/2rzou5/be_careful_what_you_wish_for_nerfing_smgs_a_topic/ This was 2 weeks before SMG receive their first accuracy nerf. And what happened? Thrustersticks did became so absurd that they need to be destroyed (rudder change) and rebuilt again. Medics did became so absurd that tesla medic circlejerk actually became a viable thing. Regenerator Mega did happen.  Medic had their range nerfed. Flying electroplaters became so absurd that they are now crippled with 10 times their original weights. Uber warp drives needed to be removed because nothing can hit them anymore. People reeealy need to look at least 2 steps ahead before they start arguing.

I tell my team to back off and focus on medics/fliers/rails while I distract the heavies by blowing them apart. Much better than my team feeding them CPU and letting them level up ahead of us.  Not to mention, with 2 layers of triforcing and some shields, they usually can't get to anything vital in the time it takes for me to cripple or kill them. I regularly finish with no deaths, which is saying something for a chopper. I'm generally near the top when it comes to score, and a good plasma chopper will drop most smaller bots in a single shot, especially in the higher overclocks. I regularly beat out the gunmats in score, and damage (and kills, and deaths).  Yes, your lightweight railer/hover medic/smg cruiser will be destroyed by them, just like my chopper will be destroyed by rails. Play to your strengths, and compensate for your weaknesses.  Plasma chopper is probably the most dangerous thing in the game if the other team doesn't have competent railers."

Whenever I get taken down by a nice 4 track, well built tank, I commend him on how much effort and resources he put in his bot then continue to stay away. But entering a match and 3 enemy tanks are all poorly built, uske msmgs, have aerorods for every mount in the world, use nothing less than 16 guns, and sometimes even stick thrusters on a tank (lol what), it can get quite annoying to be killed. Quality tanks where people actually cared about the design are fine, big bricks with no inspiration and equal performance are not. Plus tank tracks heal waaaaaaay too quickly.

Robocraft,3bgvqi,Stigawub,8,Mon Jun 29 02:54:19 2015 UTC,"so more or less insect wings, perfect. No 400-500 mph is pushing it a bit too far for something that can stop mid flight, it would be like UWB except a lot worse.  240-400 mph  I will take. The fundamental with something this fast is it's going into crash into the reactor over and over again until the reactor is dead. Which is fine as a playstyle, just not that early into the game, hence the extreme scaling of +60% speed. (plus starting off at 240 is already more than most rail gunners can track anyway). CPU cost also need to be a bit high to prevent stacking, despite already large size (actually I would want the size to be a bit smaller with high CPU cost so some hybrid builds can happen, like leg + these wings :D) Other than that, I would really really love for this to happen, certainly bringing stealth element into  sky."
Robocraft,3bgvqi,Khoakuma,2,Mon Jun 29 04:29:04 2015 UTC,The 400-500 mph is supposed to be the max speed cap at OC 13. Normally it would go around 250-300 mph

Robocraft,3bgvqi,Aethylred,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:55:04 2015 UTC,"Not really, when copters pitch down it diverts some downward thrust to rearward thrust moving the copter forward, similarly pitching up makes them go backwards. This pitching makes it very hard to ascend or descend  without some forward or rearward motion.  Basically, in Robocraft putting wings on things forces robots to fly like planes and not like copters."

For example a dragonfly has most of it's weight centered on it's thorax so it maintains it's horizontal position while hovering than a bee who has a bigger abdomen thus having an angled position while flying?"
Robocraft,3bgvqi,Spearka,2,Mon Jun 29 15:13:15 2015 UTC,I think the center of weight should change the flight angle in order to maintain stable flight as long as the craft is lightweight enough.

Robocraft,3beym7,starwars1139,2,Sun Jun 28 21:34:24 2015 UTC,Make a separate wheel tree? Make them have spikes or something. Buff regular wheels speed by like ~20% and make the spikey wheels have the speed regular wheels have now. Spike wheels should also have 100% traction on any snow/ice.

Robocraft,3bhbl9,Mtax,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:47:37 2015 UTC,Yes
Robocraft,3bhbl9,Longtimelurkerq,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:32:47 2015 UTC,Essentially all I requested ends succesfully
Robocraft,3bhbl9,radyjko,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:51:10 2015 UTC,As a platoon of medics we capped all 3 towers and then just sat in their base destroying them. 3 games in a row they surrendered with 75% reaction remaining.  Yes they had multiple medics as well.
Robocraft,3bhbl9,paegus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:58:06 2015 UTC,Just one time I think. It never said the battle ended by surrender..but there was 1/4 health left..but they could have only done the connect points..but the reactor did blow up right after the vote..so I assume it was successful.
Robocraft,3bhbl9,DumberMonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:50:40 2015 UTC,"twice so far. I'm usually hesitant on it, but I know when we are simply outdone usually. I'll usually vote no if it's early on, if it's getting kinda desprate and we aren't making much headway... GG enemy team Have this white flag in honor of your kick ass performance."
Robocraft,3bhbl9,KillaJoke,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:50:52 2015 UTC,Exactly 50/50 right now. Interesting.
Robocraft,3bhbl9,Meta_Data,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:59:47 2015 UTC,What's interesting is that the existence of the surrender option changes people's behaviour.
Robocraft,3bhbl9,JujuAdam,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:08:04 2015 UTC,"I think so, only one person voted no, our reactor explodet at 80% I thought it was bugyy"
Robocraft,3bhbl9,munit_1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:48:49 2015 UTC,"Every single time, after a surrender vote fails, the person who attempted to surrender disconnects from the game.  Due to this, I feel that surrender attempts aren't real attempts, but just players attempting to evade the punishment for leaving games.  I have only one time witnessed a surrender. The opposing team surrendered."
Robocraft,3bi81t,SNOR97,3,Mon Jun 29 12:59:47 2015 UTC,This is due to your CPU being very close to the 1511 limit. The item is being counted by it's robo ranking but also the CPU. You can test it out by taking off one of your regular guns and see how far the bar drops. This will continue until you're past the 1400ish CPU limit for T9 then the bar will only count the ranking of the item. Once past that the bar will drop very little.
Robocraft,3bi81t,FugiATX,2,Mon Jun 29 14:06:32 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, thanks :)"
Robocraft,3bi81t,Lepord829371,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, this happened when I tried to put T1 steering wheels on the bottom of my T9 SMG tank at the edge of T10. It went up almost half way."
Robocraft,3bi81t,stray29th,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:02:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think it matters much at T10 as you cannot accidently go to TX-1, you have to have a megaseat. The bar means little."
Robocraft,3bi81t,malakir42,2,Mon Jun 29 13:12:33 2015 UTC,"It matters, when all your T10 suddely go against T9 in challenge."
Robocraft,3bi81t,Juvar23,2,Mon Jun 29 13:26:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, that explains it. Mystery solved. Thanks to freejams changes to the ranking System, challenge matches are now really unfair as they're still based on the outdated rank. Typical."
Robocraft,3bi29x,BigSeeProduction,5,Mon Jun 29 11:58:16 2015 UTC,Someone desynched on the enemy team and isn't returning to mothership
Robocraft,3bi29x,Juvar23,2,Mon Jun 29 15:28:43 2015 UTC,"It's a desync error. Someone on the other team was improperly disconnected so, even though you can't see them, they're still technically connected and thus count toward the playercount. Sometimes they can even attack you without the ability for you to retaliate."
Robocraft,3bi29x,Meta_Data,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:03:33 2015 UTC,"Can't the server just forcefully disconnect them when either time runs out / a team wins? And something weird was that somewhere inbetween (between ""actual win"" and timer runs out) we got the message ""Battle won""...  But thanks for the info!"
Robocraft,3bi29x,paegus,2,Mon Jun 29 16:17:46 2015 UTC,I've never understood why the server doesn't wrap everything clients do that affects the match results in a nice tidy:  if (IsPlayerAlive(client)) {   ... } else {   NOPE(!) }
Robocraft,3bfeta,munit_1,3,Sun Jun 28 19:09:46 2015 UTC,it heals very fast too - completely in under 5 seconds
Robocraft,3bfeta,Anormalcat,3,Sun Jun 28 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"This makes me drool from how easily it would be destroyed by a rail, Or i mean, no offense but it looks really easy to obliterate o-o."
Robocraft,3bfeta,PacoBedejo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:13:30 2015 UTC,"From 15 games we won i died in 3, most time it could be prevented by a medic wich noticed me or read the chat. It is not my sturdy all-day bot, more an fun build after my wheel-thruster-sled was killed by the new bot requirements. :)"
Robocraft,3bfeta,DeepMidWicket,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:24:27 2015 UTC,Agreed. I came here to say that it made my trigger finger get all twitchy.
Robocraft,3bfeta,ColaBear92,3,Mon Jun 29 14:53:00 2015 UTC,I.... I want to shoot it with my rails...
Robocraft,3bfeta,ColaBear92,2,Mon Jun 29 14:02:26 2015 UTC,"When I think of minimalism, I often think of sleekness as well... Which this craft is not, however I guess something can be minimalistic without be sleek and clean. Anyhow, it looks pretty cool, especially the shadow as you pointed out!"
Robocraft,3bfeta,VonGod,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:41:53 2015 UTC,"Without those plates it looks lile a helicopter's wire frame, I can add a picture later. But yes you are right."
Robocraft,3bfeta,VonGod,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:28:14 2015 UTC,if that is not minimalistic I dont't know ;)
Robocraft,3bfeta,Protoform-X,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:03:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, without the plates it does look more minimalistic, I'll give you that."
Robocraft,3bfeta,Protoform-X,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"Minimalist, I love it. How quickly do you get blasted to bits, if you're spotted?"
Robocraft,3bfeta,azrael3000,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"it is relly different sometimes it dont fall to the ground, but some times really fast, but if a medic is in the near it is not bad, 2-5s and it flies again. But yes, it often dissasembles randomly ;) As a medic works better."
Robocraft,3bfeta,azrael3000,2,Sun Jun 28 19:33:08 2015 UTC,"Is it fun, though? The most important question. Out of the times you've been blasted down, is it still awesome to fly around? :0"
Robocraft,3bfeta,DaNubIzHere,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"it is absolutely awesome to fly, it gets really fast and is really maneuverable, also it is every time a surprise wich form it takes after it get shot :)"
Robocraft,3bgzei,thetaprime,3,Mon Jun 29 03:30:33 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great way to implement mega's. Limit it to one mega per team at a time for CPU reasons, but could be a lot of fun."
Robocraft,3bgzei,Sickify,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:39:47 2015 UTC,I could dig that.
Robocraft,3bgzei,The_English_John,3,Mon Jun 29 19:30:06 2015 UTC,whole team has mega bot     whole team at OC 13     DEATH
Robocraft,3bgzei,The_English_John,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:30:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah but they wont all get to OC13 at the same time,  and they wont spawn thier 1 Megabot at the same time either. Once its gone,  its gone."
Robocraft,3bgzei,Random_ines,2,Mon Jun 29 14:59:24 2015 UTC,"Still it would be hilarious to see 8 mega bots roll out of enemy base at once,"
Robocraft,3bgzei,DumberMonkey,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:05:52 2015 UTC,True emough. I suppose a team could plan it that way.
Robocraft,3bgzei,cebeide,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:46:22 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""single use""? Does it disappear over some time or is it never obtainable after one death?"
Robocraft,3bgzei,Vok250,3,Mon Jun 29 03:31:36 2015 UTC,"I would think it would be available as a ""respawn as megabot"" button made available the moment you hit OC13.  You get one chance with your megabot, and then you go back to your t10 bot."
