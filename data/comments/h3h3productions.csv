h3h3productions,3d5kj1,ultra_22,5,Tue Jul 14 11:22:00 2015 UTC,I wish I could see those bigger names making sketches and stuff with Ethan and Hila.

I subscribe to h3h3 to see new original content, not something from the front page of reddit  Ethan conveniently didn't say it was from reddit so people might think it was his own post. I thought so with the bill cosby one he shared (cause ethan does photoshops) until I saw it on reddit. Even though he didn't claim to make it, it was implied that he did because that's what I expect when they post things on their channel/social media page.  It is just a tacky cheap thing to do.

FFS people, one content creator posting a funny picture to facebook without crediting the reddit user who took it is NOT an indication of the that person's artistic integrity at ALL. He just wanted to share a funny picture with people who haven't seen it.  I've seen this a lot though, people are snobby about the more unknown youtubers they follow, because theyre ""underground"" which apparently means they somehow have a better sense of integrity, since you spend lots of time making high quality content regardless of not having millions of followers. So it takes THE most meaningless shit to make them cry, ""Oh noes! Their integrity is been compromised now!!!"", even though all you did was share a funny picture. SMH reddit, this is not something to get up in arms about."

You should always give credit when you can. In this case, there was clearly credit to give. You should have written ""from reddit"" because then it doesn't look like you are passing it off as your own.   I really understand the whole ""repost hate"" here. There are a lot of people who had seen it before and were not enjoying it at all. You are saying that because it was the front page of one of the most popular websites in the world, that you should have to post it again, to two places and maybe even more? (Sorry to burst your bubble attention seeker, but it was actually posted to reddit in the first place). It's basically just as bad as if you ripped someone else's video and reuploaded it.   Your attitude and entitlement here really bothers me quite a lot."
h3h3productions,3clc45,Yash42,8,Wed Jul 8 23:54:30 2015 UTC,It's not just as bad if he ripped someone else's video. He isn't making any money off it and he didn't claim it was his photo.

I would have never assumed that had I seen it posted. I would have laughed, clicked like, and kept scrolling.    It's basically just as bad as if you ripped someone else's video and reuploaded it.   No. It isnt. Reuploading a video is stealing, because you are taking MONEY from a content creator. Sharing a picture that was shared on reddit via imgur is nothing like that.  ps, the whole ""using the format of the comment your replying to, but changing the words to the opposite message"" trope is not very clever, and highly overdone. But that's not really my business"

It was created, written and ""hosted"" by Chris Morris and was one of the first pieces of television that had the character Alan Partridge on it. Some of it was incredibly absurd though, they just didn't really do the public announcements convincing celebrities it was real.    Edit: Also, that whole Talking Angela scandal recently reminded me so much of the Paedogeddon episode, especially with the being able to see the webcam of the paedo in the cat's eye. That was hilarious!     Morris also has this hilarious short film called My Wrongs which everyone should look up, as well as a great radio programme called Blue Jam (I'd recommend a sketch called the Suicide Journalist) which was turned into a television programme called Jam."

Here's a digital release - Side A, Side B  Here's his other project as ""Roro Perrot"" - something he calls ""shit-folk"". He's the guy on the right.
