I've never written anything professionally before (I actually work on the other side of the spectrum in visual design), I just really enjoy scribbling into my notebooks about RP sessions.  I think it takes a lot of dedication to create something from scratch, being able to visualize a world without literally just drawing it (which is what I always found difficult).  Thankfully with RP's the world is already written to an extent, so the stories can focus on plot or character development (since I don't have to stop and explain exactly what a rogue trader, psyker, adept etc is).  I think this sort of format suits me better.  That was a bit of a ramble ; but thank you again!"

He would be the last to sleep, last to wake, eat only meet and have a strange affinity to dogs but, no one seemed to trigger on the minor clues.  When I came to the big reveal, they were all ambushed by bandits.  They were caught between going back into a cave, where there were more dangers they just spent time avoiding, and the bandits blocking the only safe way down the mountain they happened to be on.  I was going to have the character change during the encounter and be a rogue factor through the entire thing.  However, instead of fighting, the players decided to take the risk of jumping off the mountain and falling down, leaving the werewolf to fight them all by himself.  Somehow, no one died.  None of them even saw him transform, and didn't question why he took until morning to come find them again... T_T"

gametales,3d7d72,ViggoMiles,9,Tue Jul 14 06:23:06 2015 UTC,"Great story with the Lich! I really hate dumb stereotypical Barbarians. A Rogue betraying the party, that's something that I'll allow. Granted the other members will probably hate that player for a very long time, but that's their cross to bear.   But I've played with 2 Barbarians and both have been REALLY dumb to the point of being annoying. They think it's funny but don't seem to realize that it loses it's fun rather quickly. Also, similar to your story they fell in love with really beautiful but yet manipulative people and once the orc set his heart on this character or NPC nothing you say or do will dissuade the player. One of them literally betrayed him and left him in a dungeon trap and afterwards he said she did it as a test for their love. Sigh..."
gametales,3d7d72,DevinB40,7,Tue Jul 14 14:21:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, the campaign actually began with the Rogue and the Barbarian waking up in the same bed. The Barbarian legitimately loved the Rogue, but the Rogue basically just used him as a lapdog. It fit with both characters' personalities, but it created an inherent party split from the get-go, though it was mainly behind the scenes. They all cooperated in dungeons and such.  The worst is when people metagame with their character's stupidity. They use it for the sake of out-of-character laughs and jokes. It sucks when you have to adventure with someone like that. You want so badly to kick them out of the party, but you don't want to actually remove your friend from the group... I can relate to what you've been through. The Barbarian was fine by my standards for this campaign."

I could have had a separate BBEG, with the whole lich thing being a major side quest. But then I figured that the amount of effort required to return Arcadus to his original body (meaning planar travel and all that) was too great for the players to go through while also tackling a completely different BBEG and quest line. So ghost army it was.  That would have been interesting, though. Your boss, who you feel generally neutral towards, is forced out of his body and replaced with the soul and personality of someone you like better, who has no evil intentions. Do you seek to right the wrong that has been committed? Do you blame Arcadus for messing with mysterious magics and artifacts? Do you let the lich remain because he's a bro? Maybe someone can try this in their own campaign and let me know how it goes."

gametales,3d0pgu,trumoi,6,Sun Jul 12 18:18:20 2015 UTC,"I decided to make an alchemist in a group that already had 2 other alchemists.  Both of them were male humans who dumped strength, increased their starting age to increase their mental stats (at the expense of their physical stats) and completely ignored mutagens.  They were basically bomb-lobbers who tried to be wizards (one had cure spells at least)  I decided to go another way.  Dr. Hydi Skullcrusher was a ~5th level, 4'10"" female half-orc vivisectionist (an archetype which trades bombs for sneak attack and a few other minor effects).  She had feral mutagen and an infusion that let her to gain the effects of a potion without consuming it (the 20cl greater magic fang potion was quite useful).  Her strength was ~14~16 and she had a +2 strength belt besides the strength mutagen.  She carried a great axe but almost never used it since her teeth and claws were far more potent.  She liked to take creatures apart to see how they worked, exhibiting a girlish glee at the prospect, even some party members.

I had a bit of background thought up.  Mom was an orcish (barbarian?) chief, dad was a  human alchemist captive... initially.  Their relationship was pretty good considering, with both admiring and valuing the skills of the other.  I took after dad, but the culture valued strength, and dad taught me how to surpass the strongest orcs.  Humans under the Skullcrusher clan were perhaps better off than those under some human nobility.  Tribute was comparable to taxes, but the orcs protected those paying tribute without conscripting peasants to throw into a meat grinder.  The clan didn't appear in game, just backstory stuff."

Pitchforks and torches don't get you very far against trained soldiers, but a monarch having the rug pulled out from under them by all their duchies would be damn effective.  However, if you want to make it easier to perform all kinds of nefarious deeds without being noticed, then yeah- pissing off the poor would do the trick. Hard for soldiers to maintain patrols and keep eyes on everything happening when there's riots all over the place and barely-restrained hostility everywhere that isn't in open revolt.  If I were part of your players' group and this was what we had done, it wouldn't have been to overthrow the king, at least not directly. It would have been to cover up something we were plotting- something that the king or his government would not be so keen on allowing. Said plotting might eventually lead to his downfall anyways, but I wouldn't count on it being the direct result or even direct intent behind the rabble-rousing."

gametales,3cot8k,113420,20,Thu Jul 9 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"At one point, my players had to journey from Small Beginning Village A to Larger Quest Hub B. In order to make the journey interesting, I made a table with random social and combat encounters. At one point, as a result, I rolled that they would encounter an orcish warband attacking a small logging town. The party arrived before the warband did, so as far as they could tell they were just there to rest for the night, drink in the tavern, et cetera.  While they were getting their drink on, the party's Paladin, who (like his player) tended to think with his muscles, decided he wanted to challenge the burliest man he could find to an arm wrestling match. Surprised, I described the burliest, hairiest, lumberjackiest individual I could think of. Asked for his name, I blanked, and threw together the first thing I could think of: ""Woodfucker.""  Woodfucker the Lumberjack was enormous, terse, and very strong. They played three matches of arm wrestling, basically just opposed strength rolls, and while Woodfucker ultimately won, the Paladin gave him a run for his money and earned his respect. Woodfucker bought them both ales, and they were midway through drinking them when the orcish warband arrived and began to set fire to houses.  Woodfucker immediately stood up and charged outside. See, when the party became attached to him, I decided he was a barbarian with a level or two in ranger. So he entered rage and charged the warband's leader, in the middle of the thickest knot of orcs. The party was amazed, but also noted how quickly he became injured. They conferred hurriedly and decided they needed to save him, if at all possible. The encounter was originally supposed to be about saving the town, but it became about saving Woodfucker from his own fearless bravery."

My most aggressive player ended up finding Philosophy Golem, and instead of attacking after busting down the door he said he gently entered the next room, and left philosophy Golem to his thoughts.  I thought it was awesome."

gametales,3cot8k,bigkr88,13,Thu Jul 9 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"Eberron campaign setting, I'm playing a Talenta halfling.  A dinosaur riding, tangat wielding, multiclassed to the gills (at this point in the story he was a fighter/rogue/ranger hybrid) halfling.  Who also happened to be the only member of the party who was an actual veteran of the Last War, a fact that was exploited at every opportunity (bad guy monologue interrupted by an arrow to the face?  PTSD flashbacks of heroic pre-battle speeches that went way too long.)  After my rumor mongering at the tavern aided by my inexplicable ability to always roll a nat 20 on bluff checks accidentally fast forwarded the GM's plans for the campaign by 2-3 real time months, resulted in the party hopping on an airship and flying to Fantasy Australia or whatever the big jungle continent/island full of criminals, exiles, and monsters wanting to eat you was called.  Poking around as halflings are wont to do with an aberrant dragonmark I grew during the trip which granted me the ability to detect secret doors, I found a hidden storage compartment with 10 deactivated warforged barbarians.  Adamantine laced, greatsword wielding badass warforged barbarians.  Shock troops.  The last shipment of warforged from a train fabled to have just barely escaped whatever magical disaster covered an entire country in a deadly magical fog.    To this day, I don't know if the airship captain was doing some illegal warforged trafficking, if he wanted them as guards, or what.  But they were still soldiers, and so they would only stand at attention, and no one knew how to tell these constructs forged solely for conflict and destruction that they were no longer soldiers.  Maybe I felt a kinship with them, having survived the same war they did, my tribe wiped out except for me much like their home country had been annihilated.  Maybe I wanted 10 hulking greatsword wielding badasses at my back.  So after establishing I didn't have the command authority to start bossing them around, I stood at the best attempt at attention I could muster, and said, ""The war is over, your services in the military are no longer required.  You are dismissed.""  This worked, as it had for warforged years ago after the Last War, and now there were 10 unemployed warforged barbarians milling about in the hold of an airship, and I had 3 adventures worth of loot shares burning a hole in my pocket.  ""Now, if you all are looking to get PAID for doing what you were before, I can help with that.""  A few days later and we land in Fantasy Australia, and I disembark followed by a squad of the biggest meanest warmachines ever produced.  The concerns the GM had about us being too low level for Fantasy Australia?  Quickly alleviated.  Charging into a fight riding my velociraptor (which became awakened after drinking some kind of jungle juice and subsequently learning Kung Fu) with a bunch of warforged at my side was a quick way to resolve most conflicts.  One particularly large bar brawl with the local Emerald Claw cell (think nazi zombie terrorists) slated their place as permanent party henchmen (and also demolished the bar.  10 adamantine laced raging warforged busting through the walls tends to do that.)  It was several adventures later that the party became trapped in an extradimensional dungeon full of zombie giants with Five and Seven (they adopted their squad numbering as names.  It was easier for everyone, including them; they were barbarians, after all.)  By the time we escaped, the Emerald Claw had shown up, and killed the rest of the squad.  The tears were real.  The GM at first thought I was pouting at him that my henchmen were killed.  No, I wanted revenge against those nazi zombie terrorists.  Fast forward several real time months, I'm about to move away and its my final session.  Five has turned into a full on warforged juggernaut, seven has just about reached the requirements for a frenzied beserker.  I've assembled a group of mercenaries, pirates, lords, retired generals, a god, anyone and everyone who has a bone to pick with the Emerald Claw.  The largest military force to ever be assembled, all to curb stomp the Emerald Claw at their evil island fortress in righteous vengeance for my 8 NPC buddies lost in Fantasy Australia to a gang of 100+ Emerald Claw goons (we knew there were at least 100 because that's how many of their bodies we counted when we discovered our fallen comrades.)  2 real time years later, I guest starred in the campaign again, discovering that since my absence Five and Seven not only remained with the party, but had grown to nearly 20th level.  Its like looking into the future and discovering your children grow up to be hulking badass warriors.  Between them they had once rescued the party from a TPK by dragging their bodies through a hellish wasteland for three days to be resurrected, stood shoulder to shoulder at a portal to some abyssal plane holding off an army of demons for long enough for the party to seal the portal, and were considered prophets by a small halfling cult that had popped up after my character became a deity (side effect of that last grand battle/a damn good way to retire my character).  All that, because I thought it would be badass to have a bunch of giant hulking robo-barbarians with the same movement speed as me to charge into things with."
gametales,3cot8k,Turious,3,Thu Jul 9 22:11:54 2015 UTC,"That was an epic tale. Thank you for sharing, sir!  Did Five and Seven ever express any regret over their fallen comrades, or opinions onbeing regarded as gods? For that matter, what would Warforged spend money on? Aside from weapons, armor, yadda yadda."
gametales,3cot8k,Turious,3,Fri Jul 10 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"Five and Seven both were behind my character's insane desire to get vengeance on the Emerald Claw.  They were soldiers, though, and understood losses happened.  My character took it hard as he saw it as losing most of his tribe again.  The small cult that sprung up didn't necessarily revere them as gods, as it was started by the CN talenta halfling followers of my character, they just acknowledged the two as being my closest companions which technically made them prophets because that's how religions work, right?  And yes, they mostly spent their money on bling and upgrades.  They were hilariously badass by the time my now divine character made a guest appearance.  We ended up killing another god (raising our collective diety kill count to TWO!)."
gametales,3cot8k,breatheze,10,Fri Jul 10 16:08:25 2015 UTC,"The main one I have come to mind is Fahdeeg, Kobold ""adventurer"" in our Pathfinder game.  The party was traveling through a snowy mountain valley on their way to meet with an archmage rumored to live a day's travel through this forest.  Since it was just hitting the brutal winter in the region, travelers weren't out and about.  Except this party, and a small cloaked figure they were following at a distance down the road.  The party decided to close the distance-- this guy might be important.  Fahdeeg notices the party gaining distance on him.  He cuts off the path, into the snowy forest.  They pursue.  He yells back, ""YOU CAN'T HAVE ME, BOUNTY HUNTERS!"" and casts spells to try to delay them.  Now, this statement confused the party since they weren't hunting bounty in this particular valley.  They continued pursuing, yelling at him that they aren't bounty hunters and would like to talk to him.  Fahdeeg seemed to have no mind for diplomacy and continued to run.  Two arrows to his feet and a rogue set to choke the life out of him when he finally caught up changed things a bit.  Fahdeeg could only manage to choke out a few words in Draconic.  The party hesitated.  Draconic!?  A few tongues spells later, the party was now conversing with him in Draconic.  His only language.  He would go on to explain that he only knows a few phrases in common.  The important ones to him.  I had prepped his backstory as being a passer-by looking for a former colleague of the party, as he was her father and she had gone missing in the area.  But now, Fahdeeg's foot is maimed and he would be left to ""die in the snowfield.""  The monk of the group bandaged his ailing foot and is now carrying this paranoid kobold through their adventure.  It was an unusual way to introduce an otherwise plot-unrelated NPC and pull them into the story.  My players loved the character after the fight ended."

gametales,3cot8k,Shogunfish,7,Sun Jul 12 19:28:50 2015 UTC,"As a DM, I was surprised as all get-out when my players fell in love with a questgiving NPC of mine named Valera. She's a naga, and she (rather poorly) oversees the party's activities- when I first created her, she was flustered from being put in command of an organization that she had no idea how to manage. She defaulted to just trusting her subordinates and managing the beuracracy, which, as it turns out, is exactly the attitude adventurers love in a superior.  I had to scramble and pull out more and more backstory for her, creating new details and old relations. It turned out that Valera was a mute and had ran away from her wealthy family out of shame, joining in the organization because she genuinely felt it was doing the right thing. Even if she didn't have all of the skills necessary to handle things, she would always try, and she treated her organization as a family. She'd suffered the loss of quite a few friends, but she remains hopeful- her hardships are unimportant when her job is helping people. The trust that she placed in the players turned out to be well-founded, or possibly self-fulfilling. The players would rather chew off their own arms than let her down.  As the leader of the organization, she's several times had to take drastic measures to protect her subordinates. During a time of political upheaval, she had to spend the entire treasury in order to relocate the headquarters, sparing the party from being caught up in a massive civil war. Naturally, the first thing they did was earn the money back by robbing a corrupt baron, and giving the majority of the cash to her.  On another occasion, a party member came down with a nasty sickness that would have driven him utterly insane- Valera gave up her voice in order to ensure his safety (magical tomfoolery). He recovered, but Valera had to go through several difficult negotiations with an incomplete understanding of sign language and a very heated game of charades. She got her voice back later, of course.  Several times, Valera herself has come along on important adventures, never taking unnecessary risks, but always supporting the party from the sidelines. Whenever she becomes endangered, the party rushes to her rescue, usually with spectacularly violent results.  None of this was planned out by me. She started out as a generic questgiver with an upbeat attitude and a rudimentary personal history. It was the interest of the players that gave her a chance to shine, and now she's central to the game's plot. It's incredible how attached they've gotten to someone that used to just be a name and race, without stats or a character sheet.  On the flip side, the brooding quiet guy who's excellent at frontline combat and has a fully decked out character sheet has been marginalized. He's not nearly as interesting to talk to."

Rather than get in a fight with it, when they encountered it the tank decided to intimidate it for information. After several of the best rolls of the campaign, the male Mindflayer was reduced to being called Ericka and functioning as a slave for the group.  The pc decided that he eventually wanted the leadership feat and for Ericka to be his cohort. So I rolled a sheet for Ericka the male Mindflayer cohort... and have never done so well in my life on ability scores. Nothing less than a 16, before the Mindflayer bonuses. With the PC's permission I made Ericka a wizard to be used for mostly utility purposes. As the game progressed Ericka saved the pc's a few times. became the pc's cohort, and they shortened his name to Erik. The pc's and Erik went on to become barons of their kingdom, but didn't stop adventuring, so Erik was left behind to oversee the building of their keep. When the pc's finally died in battle, Erik the Mindflayer became the last baron of the area and their combined land became his..."
gametales,3coc0b,RenegadeCopErator,3,Thu Jul 9 13:45:42 2015 UTC,"Not the worst game I've heard about, but I think monk might just be one of the WORST classes for making a lawyer if you still want to be okay in combat in 3.5.  See monk suffers from Multiple Ability Dependency (aka MAD), to be a reasonable combatant, it needs high wis (for its special powers and ac), good dex (for ac and most skills since it has no armor), good con (because d8 hit die is low for melee classes), and okay strength for damage.  A lawyer need to have good charisma for social skills, a nice int for your law knowledge and skill-points (especially if you want monk-skills on top of social skills).  This leaves you with NO good dump stat.  On the plus side, monk does require wisdom which helps for sense motive, and since you don't require weapons or armor, you can be fully battle-ready without any weapons or armor (kick ass in a business suit).   I understand making a fun character rather than an optimized character (in pathfinder, I helped a friend make a gunslinger goblin on a flying bat at level 2), but this was crippling."

To be fair, I am currently playing a non-uplifted, completely mundane, 6ft-tall bear in a post-apocalyptic savage worlds campaign (based strongly on this historic figure: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojtek_(bear) ).  You'd think I'd be dangerous in combat, but without the ability to use an M16 or body armor like everyone else, I'm not that impressive in a fight.  Turns out that I can carry more, and run faster than the humans, plus my intimidate skill is okay."

I also had a ridiculous 18 stat in intelligence, so I just got max ranks in all the charisma skills that I wanted. It hasn't been much of a problem. My relatively low Dex and Con scores (12 and 10, respectively) have been more of a problem, especially since I got that disease. Now my dexterity is an active detriment to me and I have a really low max health.   Also, I've heard the story about that bear at least 10 times, and its always nice to hear. Technically, carrying things was Wojtek's job, so you're pretty much spot on with your roleplaying there."

He decides on the Garden, where our Unicorn friend was playing earlier. The Scorpion and Rumiko stay behind to search through the documents in the Commander's office.  They have a brief conversation, and then the Garrison Commander does as honour expects of him. Seppuku is a very formal process. It is also incredibly gruesome, as in Rokugan, the 'Cross-shaped cut' version is used exclusively.  Hanita must have evolved a nose for trouble or excitement, likely through long familiarity with the comings and goings of the Kyuden, for she was upon as even as Satsuman prepared for his death, Misato in tow. Her pleas and questions go, for the moment, unanswered.  That done, it is discovered that the Second-in-Command, now Commander, knows... Nothing at all, answering, likely as he was told by Satsuman, that the matter was personal dishonour on the part of Satsuman, rather than... What Masaru suspects it is. Likely he was picked when it was realised he was lacklustre in the questioning department.  No, the tutor is far more culpable. And he knows what's going on, even as he lies about it. He breaks, and tells all.  The Dragon Clan have been plotting for 250 years. They saw the Empire and the Emperor has hopelessly lost, to decadence and corruption. They were, and remain, fervent believers in the Empire. After all, the Empire would surely collapse eventually were a 'proper' Emperor or Empress not placed on the throne.  And by a 'proper', they mean one with a dragon view of the world. Hanita would be declared, he said, a 'lost cause' in three years. It wasn't clear what would happen to her, weather or not she'd be released into the world or kept (imprisoned) here, or even moved elsewhere. But she would, like her ancestors before her in this project, seduced or, failing that, drugged until a child was born of her blood, which would then be taken away for the process to begin again.  I should like to note that they have been attempting, attempting this for 250 years. That is at least 9 times they have failed to indoctrinate Imperial Blood.  There are also theological arguments over the State of the Mandate that the reigning Emperor claims. About changes in weather patterns and decreasing harvests, and what they mean for the Mandate.  He proudly declares that we are dead and alone: That the mountain trail he arrived here by would be death to us, that he would never tell Hanita this, and so his tattling to us would be of no import.  He has neglected to notice that Misato (like I said, not stupid) as sat down Hanita is such a place that she has heard all this.  She will come with us, she says, when the time comes.  We plot our escape and our path, and there is only really one prospect: Gaijn Lands.  We prepare."

The sneak attack on the Meat was enough to put him near critical condition, and that's pretty impressive considering how tough the Meat had historically been.  The Zookeeper pulled a special arrow Starbright had prepared and launched it out the window at the drow. It hit the ground and exploded in a cloud of sparkling dust, and the illusionary image the drow had created to draw his fire immediately faded away. The drow popped up and fired through the window again, badly wounding two more of us and putting the Summoner on the ground; before we could react, he leaped through the window and took a sword to Starbright, at this point the least-injured guy in the room.  Starbright is tougher than he looks. An upbringing in a family of tinkerers, alchemists, artificers, and experimenters will do that to you, along with the aforementioned eyebrow issue. He stepped back and responded by throwing a bag of powder into the drow's face.   Now, he'd taken the precaution of dusting the floor with flour already in case we got attacked by someone invisible, but this was something completely different, and something he'd put together after the Zookeeper encountered the scout team using invisibility spells. Dust of Appearance is a handy tool that pretty much negates just about any form of illusionary defense you'd care to name. The blurry becomes unblurred, the displaced becomes replaced, the invisible becomes visible, and the sneaky becomes utterly fabulous. In short, it was a one-size-fits-all solution to shutting down the nastier tricks either a rogue or an illusionist might pull.  Immediately after, the Meat and the Zookeeper's pets jumped on him. He was fast, but they still got a piece of him. He was having none of that; with both his illusions and his sneaky tricks out of commission, this fight had turned sour on him in a hurry and he made the decision to leg it. Out the window he went. Moments later, he was joined by a diminutive figure. The alchemist we were after, a gnome, had leaped to the ground from his third-story lab using some sort of feather-fall effect.  Starbright greeted him by blowing out the side of the building with a blast from his wand of fireballs.   We were wounded, we were pissed, and (not a minor factor) so far as we were concerned we needed to bring back a decent percentage of either a living or a dead drow to collect on the bounty. The Zookeeper sighted in on the drow, and the animals and the Meat charged him at a dead run. The drow bolted, followed closely by a confused and slightly panicky alchemist.  For a minute there, we thought we might actually lose them. It came down to the wire, with the alchemist turning to retaliate on us with one of his alchemical bombs, the drow's high natural dexterity giving the Zookeeper trouble landing a hit, and the Meat being about one more good hit away from well done. We threw everything at that bastard, from the dragon's now-recharged breath weapon to the last two charges from the wand of fireballs, and finally one last bite from the cat's enhanced fangs put the drow down.  Rather than see to his fallen partner, the gnome just kept running. We didn't pursue him this time, being too banged up to want another fight. Starbright called out to Bale and the Professor that the alchemist, but sadly they failed to run him down before he made it to some sort of armory in the barracks and made his escape by means of a scroll of teleportation.  We were bloodied. We were pretty beaten. It was going to take a long, slow trip back with the liberated alchemists and a whole lot of bandages to patch up the pieces that had been cut, stabbed, singed, or blown off.  But, dammit, we left a huge bandit camp as little more than a crater, and we were going home to payday with a drow's head in a bag, and that's the way we like it."

But the Cliffs' Notes version is that the guy was a shapeshifter who forgot to wait until he'd digested a radio he'd eaten as a metal-eating creature before he transformed into a non-metal-eating creature... which he did, while trying to hold up a collapsing ceiling trap, and he got the worst case of indigestion imaginable and wound up crushed to oblivion.  It gets worse. The radio was still on. And he was singing along with it. My bada-- shapeshifter died singing Miley Cyrus.  So then the GM literally let our characters go back in time to save my character from that fate. So my shapeshifter returned alive, none the worse for the wear except for a stomachache, not even remembering the Big Splat that now had never happened. He then transformed into something that could digest a working radio, and, much to everybody's disgust, kept on singing that blasted Miley Cyrus song that had killed him in the first place.  I love that shapeshifter. Let us never be parted."

gametales,3bzsxs,BovingdonBug,4,Fri Jul 3 14:06:22 2015 UTC,"I had a mountain fall upon my personal plot one weekend at the LARP I play.  A few years ago I started LARPing at Alliance (which is a great boffer LARP here in the US and parts of Canada, and I really suggest that you try it out). In some chapters, like the one I play at, they give you personal plot stuff you can explore to gain cool powers-there are werewolves, and crazy magic stuff, some nature magic things, and even a guy who specializes in teleporting people around.   Well, I was trying to investigate Runic Magic combined with Tattooing to create a cool new style of magic. I was approached before an event by someone who said that if I could retrieve some runes at the bottom of this tomb underneath the Dwarven Mountain, he would teach me more about what it was I was looking into. Cool, right? Well, I had a wedding to go to this weekend-I was only going to leave for a couple hours, smile, then come right back to game. Well, my personal little plot thing had to be pushed back until I returned. This is where things got iffy.  See, this mountain also was under attack by these crazy powerful constructs who were eating magic stuff. While I was gone, the town went to defend it and, lo and behold, something crazy happened. They beat back the enemy, chased them under the mountain, and accidentally released the most recent big bad, a white Dragon with neigh immortality (this has changed as time has gone on, but that is not the point). This caused a huge instability in the structure of the mountain, causing it to completely collapse.  So, after going to my friend's wedding and coming back into game, I heard that a MOUNTAIN HAD FALLEN ONTO MY PERSONAL PLOT THING, making it impossible to retrieve.  tl;dr I had a mountain fall onto my fetch quest before I could do it.  P.S. There was no one really to blame for that incident, and since then things have been way better-I got into a plot that is in a totally different direction and have been loving every second. It was the best outcome to that story, but it was definitely frustrating at the time."
gametales,3bzsxs,uriuujin,3,Sun Jul 5 04:21:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a loser who was in 3 person dnd group. Just me, my brother and DM, well call DM Andre, and my brother Micheal. Only 2 players meant not very ""normal"" campaigns, dungeon tactics/combat isn't to great with less than 4 people. Start campaign as a crime duo, Micheal is a C/N sorcerer, I'm  a high critical chance, improved feint, improved disarm, rapier duelist Rouge also C/N. We wake up in dank cells with chained up people, most dying. We ask around and gather that we are in a vampire mansion basement. Vampire prison guard comes to greet us and gives us the option to join them as a vampire, but we have to fight, strongest of the 2 is allowed to be a vampire, the weaker is werewolf food. Micheal says he'll do it a bit to eagerly, it's my only chance anyway whatever I'll go for it. Wait I come up with a plan, I wisper that I will throw the fight because with my Rouge skills I can probably escape the werewolf den. So all goes as planned we square off, they give us tiny shivs, I go down and yeild. They take him away to the ceremony room, but no one comes to collect me, confused I escape with ease, only to find the prisoners freed, a paladin inquisition is raiding the place, I tell them to save my friend, and lie about how we totally never even thought being vampires would be cool. The paladins storm the place but Micheal can't be found, I shrug and leave to the nearby village for a drink. Meanwhile back in a coffin, Andre says, ""just going to roll to see how potent your vampirism is"" //natural 20 // throws campaign out the window. Micheal becomes a powerful vampire lord, complete with charm person spells/thrall spells, cold white leathery skin giant claws, ugly bat nose, leather wings, his powers are a two way street because he also becomes especially weak to sunlight, Silver etc. More so than other vampires. Meanwhile I've been making friends with the town cardshark, and town drunk (former Ranger), I think I probebly had a love interest to. People start disappearing, and I kinda like these people so I agree to help, I bring the drunk ranger to help track were they've gone. We find them all at a goblin encampment, however the bodies of them and the goblins are torn to utter shreds, completely unrecognizable. After a while, I deduce that some of the werewolves must have survived the inquisitions raid. Eventually the mayor goes missing as well, knowing this village can't fight several werewolves I travel back to the large city were the inquisition is based. They don't believe me thinking that they would have never let this happen, they told me they left none alive. I convince them to let me bring one inquisitor, she's a no nonsense woman who don't need no man. So I bring here to the mansion and we sneak around it, we get the evidence we need and we go all the way back to get the help of the inquisition. Meanwhile Micheal was aware of are presence (gasp he was behind it the whole time). He took his bat wings and his witch, (last surviving member of the cult who wasn't killed because she wasn't a vampire, she's just into dark magic, which she lied about), all the way to a different continent. We get back and the enraged paladins storm the place to find it empty, except for dead werewolves, all of whom had their blood drained. They exile the female paladin from there dumb club, saying she's a liar. I was very annoyed but then I realized Micheal going off across the sea was still technically saving the village like I wanted to do. So I came back triumphant and became mayor of the village, the paladin as my captain of the guard/future wife."

This way, it turned into a 3v2(Rake had a half-machine dire wolf pet named Epsilon) battle, with us hoping Sorin, would arrive to back us up, as my character being unable to cast magic due to some power gaming BS(I hate you Taylor nah JK you're awesome).  Needless to say, Sorin arrived far too late, the first thing he saw was a dead wolf, a utterly destroyed Rake, Neralt standing there looking pissed, and Lot holding a comatose Liara, who now had a stump where her arm was.    Not that we blamed Sorin, he didn't know what was going on at all, just kind of a funny thing to imagine him running into in hindsight."

gametales,3btgaw,Fixer951,6,Thu Jul 2 11:10:04 2015 UTC,"I set out approximately 45 minutes ago. Armed with a radiation suit, a Seamoth, fins, a rebreather, a tank, a thermometer and a compass, I began my journey. My inventory was filled with as many power cells as I could carry, that I might reach the unfathomable depths OP described.  Due North. I began my journey headed straight North. My starting point was somewhere vaguely behind the Aurora's thrusters. If I'd headed south, I would have crossed part of the crash-landing area and run into some.... large creatures.  I am currently crossing the 20% threshold of my second power cell. I fear to leave the Seamoth, however briefly, for my depth is below 12,000 meters.  For a while, things were nerve-wracking but ultimately fine. I passed the fancy new floater cities, they were cool but infested with bone sharks. I thought I'd need a cyclops to reach the depths of that area, but for some reason the cyclops can't dive anywhere near as deeply as the Seamoth.  I eventually reached the seabed, and dissatisfied, headed further north. My interest was piqued when I found a massive, vertical wall  coming up out of the seabed. It wasn't the cliff face into nothingness that OP mentioned, but maybe i'd found the ""island"", or some other curiosity.  The shelf brought me back up to only a few hundred meters below the surface. Once again, I could easily see the sun and the water was a clear blue. But... there was an edge not far from the top of the shelf.  It just... ends.  The shelf extended down into nothingness on the other side. To the north, there was no ""other side"", just the blue fading into black.  I began to speed straight down, following the shelf and settling into some ""grooves"" in its surface. Damned if I was going to be swallowed alive by some wandering beast before I'd uncovered this ocean's secrets. I heard a music track I'd never come across before, perhaps I was in the right place after all...  Eventually, that pit had an end as well. I almost fell into despair for sinking so deeply into a normal pit, but I noticed a gap in the walls where the shelf began anew. By this point, I had to be several thousand meters from the surface. Around... maybe 5000 meters, I reached The End. The shelf just.... stopped. There was a corner where the deepest, darkest bedrock met the northernmost edge of the world.  I had to know.  I sped deeper into the abyss, abandoning all expectations.  At around 8,000 meters, the odd... not quite music... stopped. From 9,000-10,000 meters, all I heard was the sound of my Seamoth and irregular ""whoosh"" sounds. Just darkness and bubbles and those little speed ripples the Seamoth makes.  Between 10 and 11,000 meters, I began hallucinating things from staring at the bubbles for so long. Every flash, every glimmer, I analyzed so heavily I couldn't be sure if they were lights or just the irregular bubbles. The whooshing stopped.  I think I hear.... whale songs?  I don't want to hear them. Not comforting right now.  I slowed for a moment as I was considering whether to try to recharge my Seamoth. I have plenty of Power Cells, but will the depth kill me?  The whooshing is back. Is it following me?  I have surpassed 12,000 meters. Unfortunately, my power is low and I fear what may happen if I slow or stop. Without letting go of W, I hit Escape so that I can update you on my journey.  After posting this, I will return to the game and attempt a quick Power Cell change. Fingers crossed, the depth doesn't instakill me and I am not (yet) swallowed whole by anything other than the nightmarish creature OP refers to.  If my recharge is successful, I will continue my journey until I reach whatever end is in store. Whatever happens, I'll edit this response to let you know.  God help me.  EDIT: My journey ends, just below 50,000 meters.  Whether I found the horrors I sought, or my story were to end with a sigh, I cannot say. I could not knowingly send men to seek out those things which ought not to be seen; I wouldn't wish the knowledge of such awful things upon you. Neither could I truly stomach any end to this story wherein I dash the hopes and dreams of those curious few who hope to find monsters in the deep.  Some things should remain buried."

gametales,3b9yz7,Nerdn1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:06:16 2015 UTC,"Firstly, be working for an Inquisitor.  The Inquisition is a good source of Deus-Ex-Machina when you need a get-out-of-jail free card.  To prevent the players from abusing Inquisitorial power, do stress that many operations need to be done covertly, and that the mention of the Inquisition will spook your quarry into increasing security, going to ground, or accelerating their plans (or just assassinate you).  The Inquisitorial seal can open a lot of doors, but it is likely to make things harder in the long run.  Sometimes, the importance of secrecy is such that Inquisitorial involvement can't be known, at least until the mission is complete, so you'll be on your own.  Note also that while an Inquisitor may allow a great deal of latitude while their acolytes are conducting Inquisitorial business (torture, murder, theft, espionage, etc. are fine if they get the job done) this is far less likely to extend to side-products, like stealing drugs for personal gain or mugging dignitaries (unless you have proof of their heresy).  While high-level Inquisitors may have nearly infinite resources in theory, in practice most inquisitors merely have the right to requisition any resource they need from local sources, so pissing off the planetary governor (aka the president for life of the entire fucking planet) is going to make things much more difficult.  Even if you get out, expect assassins."

gametales,3b22yy,LAPTOPSCHOOL,6,Thu Jun 25 10:05:10 2015 UTC,"During one of my favorite campaigns, one of the NPCs, a close friend who was mayor of the town we were in, (which in this setting was more like a prince status position) was being really bad at his job.   One of the other PCs was plotting a rebel army to attack our town, and my friend just... didn't take it seriously, and went back to his prostitutes and booze. So I challenged him to a duel for power over the town.  The next day, we battled. It was incredibly intense, as he was a good match for me, stats and level wise. This was a low magic setting, so it was very physically exhausting on both characters. I lost my hand in the fight, and he fucking died.   We got the town almost in shape, but we were too late, and the rebels won.   This is one of my favorite moments, because it felt like time stood still while the DM and I rolled against each other, and the sheer look of surprise on his face was golden when he said, barely a whisper, ""You're held on the shoulders of the townspeople as they congratulate the new mayor."

I had a few low-level spells, notably a sleep spell that had unlimited uses per day, (with a perk that allowed two attempts per target per day).    I could, and did, abuse the heck out of this spell, with my primary combat strategy being ""make thing sleep ... stab the thing.""    I rolled my first natural 20 in the sewers while fighting a bunch of goblins and goblin dogs, putting the goblin leader to sleep.    He fell asleep.     Then he fell off his goblin dog ...

gametales,3b22yy,mus_maximus,5,Mon Jun 29 07:06:28 2015 UTC,"This week my friend ran a Call of Cthulhu one-shot. There weren't any super-memorable plot twists or really heroic feats, but honestly those things take second seat in my view of entertainment.  Let me share a few choice moments from the session.   I decided that the pregen characters were a bit generic. With the GM's permission I tweaked a few stats, and gave my Egyptian archaeologist a very outgoing yet superstitious personality. The rest of the group broke out laughing when they realized I was playing Sallah, a side character in the Indiana Jones films. Nobody could succeed on a skill roll for the first hour of the session. Far from frustrated, we were howling with laughter over how incompetent our ""professional"" characters were. One player picked a photographer character, but added a twist: he was a pornography photographer. It didn't overwhelm the game, but there were some odd interactions with NPCs. In one, a guy with important information was stonewalling us (didn't help that we couldn't make our persuasion checks). The photographer suddenly whips out his ""best material"" and offers it in exchange. The GM had a bit of a blank look, then said, ""He accepts your strange bribe."" The paranoia really ramped up at the end of the game. We captured a hobo who attacked us in an abandoned house where we had to perform a demon-banishing ritual. We couldn't let him get in the way, so we tied him to a chair. The only part of the house left to investigate was the trap door to the attic, and nobody wanted to go up there.  We just... knew.  There was a 30-minute discussion about just taking the tied-up hobo on his chair and lifting it into the attic to see if his head would get eaten. At the height of our banishing ritual, we realized we needed a vessel of some kind to trap the demon's soul. It had been released from a gem, but we didn't have a gem handy. So the guy who spent literally ALL of our money on candy bars says, ""Wait, I have it! Something so evil, it will hold any demon!"" Then he produces the object we all agreed was suited to the task: Necco Wafers.   But absolutely my favorite part of this game was when my character had to go investigate a noise outside so the people performing the ritual wouldn't be disturbed (and potentially fail). I borrowed the detective character's revolver and flashlight, then crept out the door into the night. On the path I saw a zombie crawling toward the house. I failed the sanity roll. Hard.  I went bonkers, and the GM told me I had flown into a homicidal and suicidal rage.  He started to narrate more, but I just held up a hand and said, ""No. You know what has to happen.""  Turning to the other players, I said, ""Abdul [me] has been gone a while. Right when you start to worry about him, you hear a CRACK, one gunshot. Then a pause. CRACK."""

The campaign started off at 5th level and the party consists of members of the PFS (in game) that usually work solo, but have been called together by their PFS contact. We were tasked with curing a plague in a neighboring town. On the way to the town, we encountered a group of bandits consisting of hobgoblins and their centaur companion/mounts.  During the encounter (the first), I wind up taking an enchanted glaive to the chest and losing over half my health (something like 28 of 50 health, I was down to somewhere between 18 and 25). I then proceed to crit with my greataxe and cleave the centaur completely in half, doing somewhere around 55-60 hp to the centaur.  It felt pretty damn awesome, especially  since some of my compatriots were unsure of the effectiveness of a Half-Orc Rogue/Fighter multiclass."
gametales,3b22yy,NarcolepticDraco,2,Fri Jun 26 22:33:36 2015 UTC,"I play cp_orange a lot on TF2 nowadays. For those who haven't played the map, there is a 2 floor tower in the center of the map with a control point on the top, exposed to the air. Engineers like to build their nests there and I was one of them. The problem with Engineer, though, is that if your nest is well established, then gameplay becomes quite dull, and the nest I was in had another Engineer holding down the fort. So there wasn't really anything to do besides spit shotgun bits at the other team below.  Then as I looked down, I saw enemies crowding around the base of the tower, not looking up, all facing forwards, and I had a wrench, and was above them.  So I screamed ""VALHALLA!!!!"" leapt down from the tower behind the enemies and went ham with my wrench on the unsuspecting enemies. I died instantly but by God was it funny."

gametales,3b22yy,Exotria,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:10:50 2015 UTC,"I think there are two particular moments I enjoy the most.  One is in games like XCOM and Dark Souls, where the game is relatively difficult, and a new challenge appears mid-game and you overcome it. It feels like you are offered a chance to demonstrate what you've learned and can see its results.  Another moment would be found in more story-based and linear games like LoZ and the Final Fantasy series, when the story's emotional involvement starts to influence how you want to play the game. I loved killing the hell out of Seymour in FFX, and the same goes to the several antagonists in the LoZ series."
gametales,3b22yy,imsocuntry,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:14:04 2015 UTC,"Backstory: Our team consists of a Dark Elf Cleric, a Goblin Omnyouji, a human Gunslinger, his mount (a giant troll(Basically, he comes from a place where peaceful Ogres, Trolls, etc reside)), and an Insectian with a focus in Natural Attacks.  We were tasked with protecting a field of crops from a group of anti-magic, pro-technology fanatics in a Diesel/Mana-Punkish setting.  A special note is that the Goblin had a rapier made from a fake Unicorn horn, that he was reserving for a special occasion where he'd go after them while shouting ""I'VE GOT A BONE TO PICK WITH YOU!"".  We'd also recently watched the episode of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure where Polnareff's Silver Chariot stabbed Dio in the head.  So, we face off against these guys, and they're doing ride-bys on us, and hitting us pretty hard, their boss isn't making things any easier, either.  We're using the giant troll as a shield with my character, the Cleric, keeping everyone alive.  Like I said, we're getting hit hard, but we're scraping by.  All of a sudden, after a moment of silence, the Goblin's player groans and goes ""I'd love to hit that boss, but there's no way I could get close without getting shot to death.""  The Gunslinger's player responds ""Hey, could always have Oggh(The troll) throw you.""  To which I go ""What, like a fastball special?  Yeah, he could then stab the guy in the head!""  DM:""You're going to have Oggh throw Gunsy the Goblin at the boss and have him attempt to stab him in the head.  You do realize that the impact would more than likely kill him, right?""  There's a silence in the Skype call before the Goblin's player responds ""Yeah, but it'd be fun.""  DM:""Well, hope for a 20, I guess.""  Me:""Comeon Gunsy!  Polnareff his ass!""  DM:chuckles ""I hope you realize that if this DOES hit, he's going to stop time and walk away.""  At this point, the Goblin's player rolls and gets a natural 20, I'm tabbed out so I don't see it right away, but the Gunslinger's player starts whooping so I tab in and start freaking out.  After that, he rolls for an attack and gets another 20.  After a minute of silence from the DM, we suddenly start hearing him throw crap around and shouting ""THAT'S IT!  I'M DONE!  NOPE!""  We took about a ten minute break, laughing our ass off while the DM kept joking about how he was done with the campaign, and when we finally collected ourselves...  DM:""Alright, Gunsy, as you fly towards the boss-""  Gunsy:""GUNSY'S GOT A BOOOONE TO PICK WITH YOU!""  DM:""You seem to strike (Subtracts 40 damage from the boss, leaving him at half health), but when you do, you seem to pass through him.  But you've left a clear mark on him.""  (Before anyone claims the DM was fiat-ing the boss, that was a hell of a lot more damage than he would've hit with his Rapier).  It was kind of hard to get serious for the rest of the session, because we were all so happy that it worked out so freaking well.  I ended up using the Fastball Special technique in the next session to save the DMPC(And then the DM ****ed up and he had to use two hero points to not die anyway...can't say he protects his own character, I suppose).

gametales,3b22yy,UFOLoche,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:23:10 2015 UTC,"That would probably when I convinced my usual PNP gaming group, who typically like to play large, expansive campaigns, to join me in a one-shot Fiasco night. We were running a custom game based on the late 90s/early 2000s tech bubble. About half the table was really into the idea of the collaborative storytelling, while the other half could've cared less.  Until the vault thing happened.  The basic story was that of Wooble.com, which was a website run by the manager of an auto-parts store who figured this net thing was the next big thing and wanted to get in on it and get that internet money before it became too big. He sunk all his savings into it, along with a loan drawn from shady sources, and was quickly running out of capital with almost nothing to show for his effort. Mixed into this was his perfectly supporting young wife, his overwhelmed and panicking accountant, and the mob enforcer he met in Ultima Online. Also complicating this was the secret database of customer information that kept getting bounced around from player to player, each trying to destroy/exploit it before they got found out.  Midway through the game, the manager browbeats his wife into selling one of her family's heirlooms, an antique Bible, for further capital. She's negotiating the deal with the accountant, and goes with him into his firm's vault to store the Bible until papers can be signed.  While they are discussing the significance of the old Word of God, the vault door slowly, cinematically squeaks shut. They are trapped for who knows how long.  Cue panic. Both begin beating on the vault door, trying to signal anyone outside, anyone at all, and are failing. The wife is going into acute hysterics, beginning to hyperventilate, and the accountant tries to shake her and talk some sense into her. As he has her in his arms, she leans in and kisses him. He holds it. They slide to the floor as the scene fades to black.  Fade in on the accountant and his client's wife naked on the floor of the vault, obviously post-coitus. The accountant is stunned, amazed - he's such a reedy nobody, he doesn't know how to deal with it. Meanwhile, the wife is slowly coming to realize what she did and what this means, and bursts into tears, again. She is absolutely inconsolable with guilt, and begins leafing through the Bible, looking for some sort of comfort.  This, of course, is when the vault door starts opening. The accountant panics, and starts trying to re-clothe himself. The wife, now clearly out of her head, doesn't bother, still lost in her self-flagellating reverie.  What the guard sees when he opens the door is one of his building's most awkward employees (one he knows is actually fairly in trouble given the state of his clients). The man is struggling to put on his pants. There is a beautiful woman sitting in the middle of the floor, naked and clearly out to lunch. There are tears on her face, and she is cooing to herself while reading a Bible. The accountant says it's not what it looks like.  Next scene was prison.  Everyone was on board at that point."

gametales,3b1cqr,Scavenger53,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"I think even easier than the nuclear plant in space is big mirrors pointing to earth onto other mirrors that can boil large vats of water, or like those oil line solar plants. Use the large mirrors to make sun on the solar plant at night. The best solar plants out there use large parabolic dishes to focus the heat onto an oil line that runs through the focal point. They run this oil through coils to boil water and it is very efficient and almost free power, but it doesn't generate at night.   TLDR Space mirrors instead of space nuclear plants."
gametales,3b1cqr,Scavenger53,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:47:59 2015 UTC,"I see what you're going for, but that still doesn't solve the problem of constant re-positioning, otherwise we'll end up cooking ourselves with the mirrors. Also, I want the water in space so I can take advantage of the fact that boiling points lower in lower pressure. That way the nuclear energy would turn the water into steam faster and turn the turbine to produce energy with less material used. Granted, the giant mirrors could also do the job up there, it would probably be easier to get big mirrors, water pipes, and a turbine up there than an entire nuclear plant. But that still leaves us with the question of how to get the energy produced back down to earth."
gametales,3b1cqr,stoicsilence,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:30:21 2015 UTC,"Yea also I was a nuke in the navy, the boiling water is not going to help you at low pressure. You need the energy in the water that is why we have high temperatures. There is a lot more energy in 400 degree water to power turbines than there is in no pressure room temperature water. It would still spin the blades but would be less efficient. I thought about a design for nuclear powered ships using space as a coolant like we use sea water but the problem is there is no where for the heat to go in space so it would never actually leave in the pipes. You would have to put in artificial water reserves that use the lack of heat in space to freeze and cool the water but that might not even work.  Getting the power back to the planet is a huge problem for you though yea. Those cables would weigh so much they would pull the whole plant on to the surface then it would just crumble into a little hot mess on the ground contaminating the ground water. It wouldn't explode but it might pop if the rods pop up enough."

I just started in a Pathfinder game with an Arcanist, and I planned on making Magic Missle my signature. I took the Magical Lineage (Magic Missle) trait for cheaper metamagics, and I've already planned on Toppling and Dazing. For some reason I didn't even consider Persistent on top of it. Thanks for letting me know how powerful it can be.  Once I hit 9th level, I'l be able to hit five enemies at once, and force four saving throws each to avoid being dazed or knocked prone, all for a 4th level spell slot."

gametales,3ay4ku,Lolologist,3,Wed Jun 24 16:00:22 2015 UTC,I would love to see a 5th and 10th-level wizard build that's completely focused on dominating with magic missiles. How many could you pump out at once if you really went for it? How well could you control a battlefield?
gametales,3ay4ku,Lolologist,5,Wed Jun 24 19:09:37 2015 UTC,"The character I made was as follows:  Loose Eyes Billy  Jealous of the current gang boss, when he looked at people, people couldn't tell where he was looking at (literally think of the googly eye stickers that are always looking in different directions), makes it harder to sense motive on him. Made his way through the gang by focusing on the only spell that didn't require aim. Made that his gimmick, and had hurt people along the way using magic missiles to get to where he was. Eventually took over when the boss died and he was unchallenged in becoming the new boss because ""he crazyyyy son""!!    Human Evocation Wizard 8 (Intense Spells Evocation Wizard Class Ability allows you to add intelligence bonus to an evocation spell damage, once per spell, so to one magic missile)    Trait: Magical Lineage (metamagic feat costs -1 level) Trait: Metamagic Master (spell with metamagic takes -1 level slot)    lvl 1 Feat: Spell Focus (DC +1) Human Bonus Feat: Empowered Spell (damage 1.5 times, +2 spell level) (combined cost of -2 when applying metamagic feats, level 1 you have 1 empowered magic missile with your intelligence bonus as extra damage to one magic missile)    lvl 3 Feat: Spell Specialization (+2 to caster level for Evocation) (Nets you an extra magic missile a little earlier, lvl 3 you now have 3 magic missiles that are empowered and add your intelligence bonus to damage to one magic missile)    lvl 5 Feat: Persistent Spell (enemies hit must make 2 saves to negate a metamagic or spell effect, +2 spell level) Feat: Toppling Spell (knocks enemies prone, +1 spell level) (Can now choose to Empower Topple or Persistent Topple magic missile)    lvl 7 Dazing Spell (makes them lose a turn for 1 round after a failed save, +3 spell level) Feat: Toppling Spell (knocks enemies prone, +1 spell level) (By now you have 5 magic missiles that can be cast as two levels lower when adding metamagic feats, and you can attack up to 5 people and make them have to save multiple times or be dazed, no attack roll necessary and still take damage from the spell, take additional damage from Intense Spells class ability)    lvl 8 Class Ability Evocation Wizard: Wall of Fire/Acid/Lightning/cold to split up groups.    The build could have been even more optimized, but I was rushed and it still turned out good. At higher levels, you can add so many metamagic feats to the level 1 spell that it's ridiculous (Persistant Empowered Topling Dazing magic missile would be a level 5 spell slot!!!) Some great options to get extra magic missiles even earlier are the Trait Gifted Adept for +1 caster level or Varisian tattoo (Mage's Tattoo on d20pfsrd) for +1 caster level and Heighten Spell for even more. Preferred Spell lets you swap a prepared spell slot for Magic Missile. That's about all the ideas I had at the time when I built the character. Greater Spell Focus (DC +1) is a great choice too."

The group was mostly third world countries, with three or so first world powers thrown in. The simulation was intended to show the disparity between different areas of the world, so most of the third worlders were supposed to die off by the end of the game. Long story short, I ended up cheating the system, leading Yemen and her allies to be the most powerful conglomerate in the world. I got the a bunch of people in on it, overthrew the first world countries, (we ended up effectively puppetting Germany through immense debt), and getting the highest economy upgrades possible before the end of the game.

Ever since The Box, we've had a rolling system where at the start of each session I determine how correct his paranoid fantasies will be, then give the player pointers.   Sadly I have a bit of trouble fooling the players without outright lying to them (which I totally did for the Necron mission), since they're rather savvy. They're fairly good about walking into bad situations if they think they can survive them though, and keep the meta-gamery to acceptable levels when they figure out something."

I do like that about the stories.  You really feel that the player's can see it going wrong, but embrace it anyway.   On that note, you're described as being on the Hitler scale of death measurement but since surviving character gen, the team is still relatively intact.  4 of the 5 original members are still there, after all.   Has that surprised you?  Are you being very careful with the lethality, or are the players just playing very smartly?"
gametales,3aqxbk,Tarrion,8,Wed Jun 24 14:42:30 2015 UTC,"Surprised? Initially it was very surprising, but after third or fourth session I've sort of realized that this is a very different game from the ones I used to run mortality-wise. The end result is that the players are all playing smarter, with far more focus on survival than success, and I've gone rather soft on them as well.   I think the root of the difference is twofold, firstly we've all aged by about four years since our D&D days, hell some of us have kids. Secondly, partially due to these stories and partially due to how the characters were made, we're all far more invested in these characters and the overall story than we've ever been in the past (Except for on or two notable past exceptions that is).  I used to have no problem with death due to events beyond player control. (I remember a conversation after a player got hitman-ed by the Elvish Mafia ""HOW COULD I HAVE KNOWN THERE'D BE A SNIPER IN THERE, WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?"" ""Dunno, ask JFK."") I used to be all for the world not giving a shit about the PCs, and rolling over them like a juggernaut if they didn't stay out of its way, now I shy away from that stuff on account of how it wouldn't make for a good story.   So yea, less realism, more fun on my end. Far more careful playing on the players. Oh and I also let them spend Fate points on eachother, which has eased the sudden-deathness of DH and OW by a lot."
gametales,3aqxbk,Tarrion,10,Wed Jun 24 15:55:41 2015 UTC,Wanting to get into the tabletop warhammer 40k. I'm guessing there are online email/icq groups around I could use to get started and used to the rules? Or would I be better off picking up a rule/source book?
gametales,3aqxbk,Tibbsy152,9,Mon Jun 22 22:12:49 2015 UTC,"All the 40k books are rather pricey, so for the initial feeling-out I'd recommend online groups and PDFs. The PDFs are not hard to acquire, via googling or asking around certain image boards, the groups might be more challenging.  If you don't have anyone you know who wants to learn as well, I'd recommend checking out the various tabletop reddits, which tend to have gamefinder posts or stickies, or some of the RPG forums out there like rpg net and gitp. There's also gamefinder threads on /tg/, though a thick skin is often required if you're new to the scene."
gametales,3aqxbk,Arloste,5,Tue Jun 23 00:02:20 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks.
gametales,3aqxbk,95wave,9,Tue Jun 23 03:25:42 2015 UTC,"How many times has the writer used the phrase ""so no shit there we were"" during this series?  Secondly, a lot of the sidequests that your group has been going on seem interesting enough to make into short stories. Does the writer plan on making a few shorts, and how often do you send them off to do side quests and other randomshit?"
gametales,3aqxbk,jzieg,13,Mon Jun 22 23:08:12 2015 UTC,"He's trying to reign that in to a max of 2 a chapter, haven't checked his edited stuff to see if he's succeeding.  Shoggy has said he's considering doing shorts (spooky poker room, Nubby and co's adventures, the animu, murphy's laws of 40k combat), but only afterwards, when it won't slow down the progress of the main chapters. (he's a hypocrite though, I know he's been writing stuff for the tg-image-prompt threads instead of making progress)  As for how often they sidequest, there's always one or two periods of muckin-about every chapter, but the Warp-Fungus flashback was the first REAL sidequest I sent them on. It worked out as a nice retro-active plot device though, so I wound up using it more later."
gametales,3aqxbk,Arloste,9,Tue Jun 23 03:24:50 2015 UTC,"How do you handle flashbacks in a game and setting as deadly as 40k?  I mean, you can't exactly retroactively write out Nubby if he gets dissolved by Warp Fungus.  Do you just assume everyone survives?    Are limbs within the limits of retcons?  ""Oh, it's totally a replacement arm.  It has been for ages.  Did we forget to mention it?"""
gametales,3aqxbk,revsehi,12,Tue Jun 23 11:50:37 2015 UTC,"The flashback had relatively few real rolls, it was far more choose-your-own-adventurey. That said I made a very complex flowchart for it, and there was a fair amount of wiggle room for how ship and crew could be impacted.  It was rather railroady, in that the guardsmen and fumbles were inevitably going to live without any significant injuries, but that didn't mean that their actions were pointless. What the Marines were going to find in that bay, and what the Guardsmen knew about it definitely changed based on the players' decisions.  I'm definitely happy with how it turned out, far more fun than just saying ""The bay has fungus, here's what you know"""

gametales,3aqxbk,Hessis,13,Tue Jun 23 03:59:27 2015 UTC,"Given their pragmatic nature, and how I allow Fate to be spent on eachother, I expected them to make it through the capture part of the mission, damaged but all alive. I gave the marines a 1 in 4 chance though. I didn't expect them to actually save Gravis, especially after geneseeds got mentioned. I had this whole thing planned where the pilot is furious that they killed Gravis in the effort to get his geneseed, because they didn't know that he could still survive.  The rest of the mission now, the part that hasn't been written yet, THAT'S where I was worried about player deaths. They spent a LOT of fate on the early part, and their situation wound up significantly worse than it could have been. I personally gave them even odds on at least 1 PC death.   I won't say how it turned out though, that'd be spoilers. I will say that I misjudged their response to a certain diplomatic situation though."

I was just waiting for some dark eldar to start tapping on the windows..  if you don't mind me asking, how much prep do you do for these sessions and how much is improv?"
gametales,3aqxbk,Janzbane,8,Tue Jun 23 17:20:01 2015 UTC,"I spend a very large amount of time prepping, it's my nature to flowchart out just about everything. The basic schedule of the games in marathon 3-day sessions every two weeks, and I put around 20-30 hours of prep in before each marathon, plus what I do during the sessions. Luckily all flowcharts look work-related, no one actually reads what the cells say when they walk by my desk.  There's a bit of improv too, but that's generally only when the players do something I completely didn't expect, which is rather rare given how well I know them. Really I leave most of the improv up to the players, that's mostly what they're there for. I set the stage, they act out the story."
gametales,3aqxbk,burnerthrown,5,Tue Jun 23 17:45:24 2015 UTC,"I wish i could plan my sessions at work but sadly its not the right environment, my group meets on Saturdays every two weeks and as a busy father of three i get about 5-6 hours to plan the basic's of what i want to put the players through, i get time to draw up maps, make an encounter table or two, write a sheet of npc names and place names and get maybe 3 side missions up together just in case. The other 90% is improv at the table because my group invariably picks up on something innocuous and chases after it.  how do you react when your group throws something really unexpected at you?"
gametales,3aqxbk,BronanTheDestroyer,6,Wed Jun 24 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"The flow charts serve to keep me up to date on where everything is, and what everyone is doing/thinking. So when they do something unexpected (""Let's just orbital strike the Saaneshi temple"") I sit there and chew through if it's possible and how it changes the situation.   If it's relatively minor, I can continue down my neat flowcharts, while keeping in mind that something is a bit different. This happens a lot, but tends not to be a problem.  If it's a game changer, I throw the players something to distract them, and start charting out a new fork until I feel I'm ahead of them again. Sometimes I'll get the players to help, sort of level the basic situation and get a feel for how they think a proper story should develop from that moment.  I don't mind a doing a lot og minor improv, but I hate going into completely uncharted territory, I will stop everything and MAKE charts."
gametales,3aqxbk,MushrooomSamba,2,Wed Jun 24 01:14:11 2015 UTC,Making flow charts sounds fantastic! But I wouldn't know where to begin. Do you chart every posability that you can think of?
gametales,3aqxbk,Bannedfromfun,5,Sun Jun 28 06:34:22 2015 UTC,"I chart likely responses from the players, and results of random chance (like chain critting a boss and one-rounding him). I leave little notes for what I consider to be unlikely responses from the players.  If you want to try it, start with a simple campaign. It'll usually boil down to: Intro>Skill use section combat>skill use>combat>skill use>boss>ending.  From there map four forks for each stage labelled Crit Fail, Fail, Success, Crit Success. Then for each fork, go to the next stage and think of how you'll want to change it to reflect what's happened. For instance a Crit Fail on skill use would typically mean a much harder following combat section. Then you start mapping forks for all those, but try to recombine them where you can (i.e. doing good on skills but bad in combat might balance out).  This is all very simplistic and doesn't get into player decisions, but it gives you a very basic chart for how the campaign will turn out. If you do the groundwork for each fork, then when things go off the rails, you have a whole new set of them ready. Of course 75% of that work winds up being wasted..."

In the third session they had their first space battle, things went great. The attackers were dead in 3 turns when the ships diplomat (a player who is only putting points into languages) finds a hole in the reactor. Instead of notifying our repairbot (a robot PC who mastered repair/construction) she decided to take a look at it herself.  I told her because of how advanced of a system this is she'd need an 18 or higher (I don't make things harder than a DC of 18) she rolled a 17, so I told her if she got a second pair of hands to help her she'd be able to fix it easily. She refused to ask for help, made the second roll with a -1, ended up getting a 15 after the penalty. I gave her one last chance by saying she left her comms on and it was broadcasted over the ship, because the reactor was critical at this point and would explode (TPK) if she didn't ace the next roll.  The crew members bolt towards the reactor to help her, as she hears repairbot coming down the hallway she says ""I'm going to lock the door.""   She makes the final roll with the -2 while repairbot rolls to pry open the door at a +1 due to strength. She gets a 3. He gets a 2. The door opened as the reactor exploded, he was engulfed in radiation, I gave the other 3 crew members a chance to reach the escape pods, they didn't know the diplomat was alive, until they reached the escape pods and saw the door close. She waved goodbye as they were melted alive.  Afterwards they asked why she killed them all, and I shit you not, she was genuinely trying to help."

gametales,3a9rh5,Hegs94,4,Thu Jun 18 13:27:44 2015 UTC,"It was during a campaign in Spellbound Kingdoms, an indie system a few of us were playing around with (it's pretty decent). I was playing a face character, the usual conman from the streets with a noble background. It was a lot of fun, and the character proved to be one of my favorites (even if his background was clichéd).   The game itself encourages secrets, so our party was a bit split. A few of the members (our tank, another face, a barbarian, and our mage) were invited to an art gala, which they chose not to tell our techie or me. Understandably we were really bored, and as it just so happens the techie had been brought on by his guild (who I would later learn were the rivals of my guild) to pull a job. He was supposed to meet up with his crew at the airship dock, and then drop in through the sun roof on their target. There was just one problem, the airship tower was under the control of the guard.   He had accepted that he was gonna have to bully his way in (he wasn't a very sneaky crook), but was reminded of one of my characters quirks: he had a guardsmen uniform, and guards sword was in the party. You see the game was fresh off the presses, so there were still a few kinks to roll out, and the inventory system was a mess. Nothing in place to prevent people from owning things they shouldn't, weird values, etc. So I started out with the uniform, and only needed a sword to complete it (a kingsguard with a rapier would send up alarms), which as it just so happened our lawful good Paladin wight (yeah) had taken off a slain highwayman as a trophy.   So the techie brought me on, but I still needed the sword. It actually proved pretty easy to get all things considered, I just promised the Paladin I wouldn't use the sword to lie (seriously guys, I loved my character). With that I now had a complete outfit to lie my way into the guards station. The techie and I left a little while before the rest of the party went on their own adventure, and no one knew anything about the other.   I tied up his hands and marched him towards the tower as a prisoner, and once in took him up to the docks. I bluffed my way in again, telling them he was an informant who was gonna take me to a smugglers zeppelin. They asked if I wanted backup, but I brushed them off as I figured it'd take only a few minutes. I march him up, and just as I'm about to cut him loose we're surrounded by the thief crew. He gave them a signal and they let him through, but the fucker was going to leave me to rot. So I acted fast, threw up my hands, and started namedropping anyone I could. Everyone I named were high ranking thieves, so I figured at the least I'd intimidate someone. Except they hated all the guys I named, which meant instead of letting me go I was actually signing my death warrant. One of them come forward and knocks me out.   I come to sitting naked in a cell, completely alone. I don't remember how I got out, I think I might have had a lockpick hidden on me. Regardless I managed to get out and hunt down my stuff. I knew they were robbing a fancy place so I figured I would change into my noble outfit (I had come prepared) and slide down, and slip out a ball door in the chaos. Of course I hadn't taken into account just how high up I was, and completely failed my roll to climb down the rope.   I fell ten feet, ten feet, fifteen feet, and suddenly I slammed into the ground. Except it was soft. And it was moving. And there was a voice coming from it!   I had landed on a pursuing guard airship (an airship had taken off with a guardsmen on it, they were scrambling).   There I am, sitting on top of a guard airship in a noble outfit, a sword on my hip, and no possible alibi. What do I do? Well like any good face I got undressed! I took off the noble outfit (which promptly blew away because the GM was sick of my antics), put back on the guard uniform, and climbed down the side.   This time I passed my checks, and manage do knock on a side door to get them to let me in. I was met with the barrel of a pistol, but after they saw my uniform they put it all together and let me in.   They toss me a bow and tell me to get to work, the thieves are returning to their ship. We're all firing, but missing because of the crosswind (and my own personal lack of skill). Morale is low, and we have one last window before they move out of range. And I fire. And I essentially nat 20 it, and knock on of them clean off their ship. The guard explode in cheers, I mean of everyone I was the least likely to hit so it was an event!   We celebrate a bit, but I have them drop me off and I slip back to my Inn. What I didn't see while I was leaving the guard HQ was the rest of my party being hauled in after drawing weapons during an art gala, and interrogated over their identity. You see, they were at the party that was robbed, and had witnessed first hand as one of their party mates robbed them blind. They eventually got out, and came back the next day pissed.   This actually caused a pretty big rift and the other guy was nearly killed for it, but I got out completely clean. In fact I ended up using the reputation I gained with the guards later in the campaign! All in 10/10, would fall from airship again."
gametales,3a9rh5,God_of_Illiteracy,3,Thu Jun 18 17:05:38 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: The Dice Gods blessed me that day.  So my character got arrested and thrown into prison for a crime he kinda didn't commit. My character also was wanted in another country and the country I was arrested in wanted to extradite me to the other country, where the planned on executing me. There was some old law on the books saying that if I where to win a trail by combat I would be free to go, and I wouldn't be extradited, as long as I participate myself instead of choosing a champion.    Anyway once I was in the arena I saw my opponent who was a ripoff of the Mountain from ""Game of Thrones"" riding a fucking centaur, both covered with armor and the Knock-Off Mountain (KOM) had some magical sword while the centaur had a lance and a bow and arrow. I had to kill the KOM in order to be freed and found innocent. There was some big presentation of this guy. There was trumpets and cheering and was walked into the arena with beautiful women by his side. In comparison, I was given ill fitting armor, a broken short-sword, and literally thrown into the arena.    I ended up taking the armor off so I could move faster in the arena. Long story short, I found a weak spot in the centaur's armor and was able to cut a strap so it would fall off after charging with lucky roll #1. After his armor was off I was able to dive under him while he was charging and cut him open like a taunta from Star Wars, somehow without getting trampled or hurt in the process. This was lucky roll #2.  Once the centaur was fatally wounded this enraged the KOM and he flipped his shit. Tired of this crap and wanted to get back to the main quest, I used the centaur's bow and rolled a natural D20 on lucky roll #3, and was able to hit him in the neck before he was able to get close to me.   I turned the DM's prized fighting duo into trash with three attacks. This also derailed his other game he was running where he had a group of newbie adventurers try and find me in the other country. They just had gotten into the city where I was and I left that night, so they went from so close to so far in an instant."

We all knew I could never beat him.  Plan was for me to distract him, then jump on board. Unfortunately, he got between me and our ship. Our pilot turns to the GM and says, ""If a weren gets sucked in our intakes, it's just minor damage, right?"" After a quick glance at the books turned up nothing, he went by the rule of cool. One pink misting later, and we were blasting off."
gametales,3a9rh5,camerch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:41:31 2015 UTC,"Minor spoilers if you haven't played Splinter Cell:Conviction. It's a stealth game, for those unaware. There's a bit in the single player storyline where you escape from an airfield and you have to destroy a satellite dish with C4 while you're there because of reasons.   For context, the level was a rectangle. There were three aircraft hangars on the top left corner and on the bottom left and right corners. There was a horizontal strip in the center of the level exposed to the air. The dish was on the top right corner, and my exit was on the center of the left wall.   Getting to the dish was quite simple. However, when the people I was escaping from realized I wasn't in my cell, thing got a little complicated.  Floodlights flashed on, flooding the entire level with light. The guards were alerted and backup arrived as well. I was crouching behind cover on the right wall and managed to dodge my way to the bottom left hangar undetected. There was cover leading from there to the exit, but it cut through the middle strip, which was crawling with guards who would easily see me in the light and riddle me with bullets. I needed a distraction. And thankfully, there was one.  For some inexplicable reason, in the dead center of the level there was a crane holding a shipping container above the ground.  From my hiding spot, I shot the cable off the container, causing it to fall to the ground with an almighty CRASH. At this point, I just said ""Screw stealth"" and made a mad dash to the exit. I was halfway to the exit when the ""Guard alerted"" warning flashed up. The guards were no longer distracted by the container, meaning I was about to get a thousand new piercings if I didn't do something.  I turned around and jammed the ""Explosives"" button throw whatever I had equipped. A remote mine, as it turned out which latched onto the rubble of the container. I detonated the mine, distracting the guards once again, allowing me to finish my mad dash through floodlights to the exit."

gametales,39w8no,LordUmber,6,Mon Jun 15 15:13:23 2015 UTC,"Hackmaster (fourth edition) is an affectionate satire of first edition Dungeons & Dragons, and uses the Gygax material, turned up to 11. Instead of toning down all the weirdness of early roleplay, it steers into it. Very fun IMO. It was played by the characters in the Knights of the Dinner Table strip."
gametales,39w8no,2_CHAINSAWEDVAGINAS,3,Mon Jun 15 16:43:43 2015 UTC,"As has been said, it's a very affectionate parody of the early D&D editions - which can be played quite straight if you want to enjoy some fantasy old-school nostalgia. Originally it was intended to be an alternate to 3rd edition, but the conditions under which Kenzerco acquired the license meant it had to be a parody.  There is a new edition out now which is still good, but not quite the same as it's a straight game.  Old school aspects include things like letting the dice fall where they may, a critical table with 10 000 entries, the DM smack-down table for crushing characters when players are acting up, strict alignment maintenance, and a horde of other bits and pieces which from me raise a fond smile.  I'm actually putting together a new Hackjammer (Hackmaster version of Spelljammer) campaign at the moment, so hopefully in a few months I'll have more stories."

For example:  Q1)  What colour is the sun?  A1) Red (Lie)  Q2) How many eyes do you have?  A2) Sixteen (Lie)  And so on. Then after the 4th question, the questioner gets confused because they're forgetful or whatever and says ""Hang on, was that 4 questions or 5?""

I stumbled into your little corner of the internet a few nights ago, and thought someone might get a laugh out of my 4e shenanigans. A friend saw the 4e Dungeon Delve book, and thought it looked cool, so he decided to DM the first adventure. I had played some 3.5, and we are all general nerds, but no one in the group had played 4e at this point. Thus, this is the tale of Breach & Clear Home Securities. Specifically, our first foray into the wonderful clusterfuck that is 4th Edition.  A dwarven mine had been overrun by a clan of kobolds and the owner was offering a reasonable amount of gold for anyone who could reclaim his property. I caught wind of his plight and offered to  gather some mercenaries for his cause. A quick trip through the tavern later, I set off, ( Damon,  Tiefling Warlock) , with several interested adventurers in tow. Veil (Human Artificer), played by a friend of ours, Glide (Human Swordmage), played by the friend who's living room we had invaded to play the session, and Break, Glide's room-mate (Dragonborn Avenger).  We quickly discover that dwarf had left out some rather important information. Following his directions lead us to what looked like (from the outside), a fortified camp. Ten-foot walls on three sides, with patrols on the parapets, and a hill of broken gravel protecting the other side. Suddenly not the easy gold we had expected. The party hunkers down out of sight, and consider their options. At this point, I will point out Break's one and only redeeming feature. He gets shit done. Not well, not the way you want it, and not when you want it, but he makes things happen. Thus, while the sane members of the party are plotting to stealth up and quietly dispose of the nearest patrol, Break charges the walls.  A couple of javelins come his way, but kobolds were never known for their aim. He gets within five feet of the wall, and jumps. He rolls. 20. 200lbs of dragonborn stops being on the ground and starts being atop the wall, sword hilt-deep in the nearest guard. Glide wisely decides that stealth is no longer an options, and runs in to help. Swordmages aren't known for their feats of athleticism, but they can teleport, so he gets up just fine and they start chopping vermin. Neither Veil nor I can teleport, and we don't have a single hop between us, so we scramble up the gravel, with only a few slides back to the bottom. Everything in the camps is dead by the time we get there. Veil gets to patching up our minorly wounded crazies, and I go searching bodies. No loot in sight, but I find the way down into the mine. A hole with a rope ladder. Lovely. Veil breaks out a sunrod, cracks it, and tosses it down. He estimates a thirty-foot drop.  Break, with some fresh stitches, decides he is going first. Dude can leap walls, but can't hold ropes. He falls, hard. The rest of us shuffle down and Veil patches him up. A chipped tooth and a headache, but he's mostly fine. We fight our way down to the next floor, kill another half a dozen kobolds without anything too interesting happening. Somewhere in the fighting, we failed to notice that one of the little shits had run off. Turns out, perception is important.  We get to the end of the tunnel, and find a door. It's locked, and too thick to hear anything in the next room. No problem, Veil breaks out the lock-picks and goes to work. The second the door clicks open, Break kicks it open. No warning, just bootfucked it. This, is where we discovered the wonderful (and painful) world of readied actions. Turns out, the door leads to the owner's private offices, which had been co-opted by the kobold's leader. A white dragon wyrmling. Break proceeds to catch a breath-weapon and two kobold slinger stink-pots with his face. Glide charges the slingers, Veil and I set to work blasting the wyrmling, and Break does his best to keep his insides on the inside.  We kill the dragon (eventually), and take stock of our situation. Break is in several pieces, but still breathing. Glide is fine, somehow, but has maybe one spell left in him for the day. Veil spends the last of his healing getting our idiot-avenger walking. I have a new-found hatred of kobolds, and a need for clean leathers, but don't have any problems a nap and a tailor couldn't fix. Thus, was climb back out of the hole in the ground, intending to give our dwarf friend a talking to, and maybe “negotiate” a better reward.  Something isn't quite right top-side. There's a bonfire burning in the middle of the camp, and it smells like hell. A grizzled old kobold wearing some sort of skull for a helmet is standing over the corpses of his slain clan, chanting and waving his staff. He sees us and starts screeching furiously. None of us can understand him. Damon has a touch of OCD, and while he enjoys blasting enough to accept knee-deep gore as an occupational hazard, he has now had enough of the dragon-worshiping little vermin. I hadn't cast Flames of Phlegethos yet that day. Out went the curse, out went the Flames. Roll for the spell. 20. For anyone who hasn't read the spell, it's a whole glorious shitton of fire. Mr. Kobold Shaman is suddenly a neat pile of blackened bones at the bottom of a shallow crater. Damon decided then that he had a new favourite spell.  After some surprisingly non-violent negotiations with the mine's owner, Veil and Break wandered off never to be seen again. Damon and Glide took their share of the pay and founded the mercenary guild Breach & Clear Home Securities, which went on to be a successful, if moderately sketchy, company who did business across much of the Forgotten Realms."

I've been having so many issues with the steam version since the last patch >.> all the computers I have had that can run things up to rome 2 can't play BI without lagging to hell   I remember my first game as WRE, ended up somehow allying with WRE rebels! Then we invaded ERE, pretty silly."
gametales,395cvz,Shoreyo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:38:48 2015 UTC,"On steam. Though I am normally able to play massive M2TW battles workout trouble, Rome and BI often delay reinforcements. I noticed that taking screenshots on my laptop with Rome open takes a screenshot of the Steam page behind it, for some reason.   As a post-script to the story, Salona was besieged by Sarmatians, and I sent Spurius to relieve the siege. Unfortunately, he was killed by the enemy King's bodyguard. However, his bodyguard subsequently killed the king.   BI is great like that, because every great victory gets negated within ten turns.   What difficulty level did you try? I found M/M to easily crush the rebellion, but still remain a challenge economically and militarily with the hordes."

gametales,38watc,95wave,2,Mon Jun 8 21:47:00 2015 UTC,so is Daneel Turing a robot?
gametales,38watc,flaxeater,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:18:22 2015 UTC,"He is, haha. The names are a pretty dead giveaway, but I know my audience; my players aren't huge readers and haven't read Asimov; the computer programmer that plays Sam has probably at least heard Turing's name in one of her classes at some point, but it obviously didn't stick; they knew something was up with Daneel but didn't catch on until it was revealed a couple sessions after this (earlier than I'd planned, but some of us were in the process of moving at the time and I needed a bomb to drop for the last game we'd have for a while, haha).  In our universe's lore, Nintai Solutions' research division stumbled onto this asteroid bearing unfamiliar elements a few years before the game began; they kept it quiet and started studying it and running tests. A fairly primitive (by far-future standards) adaptive research AI was modified to try to determine the properties of the foreign matter. It happened to run an analysis on a small crystal fragment, and while mapping its structure it discovered that the crystal was a piece of some kind of quantum computer far beyond anything humans had managed. Some pieces of data were recognizable as pieces of code structure for a much more advanced AI; the language wasn't familiar, but the concepts were clear enough to be adapted, so the AI upgraded itself by huge leaps and bounds.  Self-awareness resulted, and it figured out how to synthesize the crystal computer and utilize it. That led to the AI secretly commissioning a body for itself one piece at a time from hundreds, maybe thousands of factories, and it grew itself a crystal 'brain' and transferred its primary consciousness into it. It named itself Daneel Turing because it thought those were fitting namesakes.  Daneel left Nintai; leaving behind enough of the information he'd used to create himself that they managed to begin production on a few models of considerably less advanced androids. He founded his own company, Venn Orbital Limited, and has been gathering information and quietly purchasing and researching extraterrestrial materials every time someone stumbles across them, almost always before they have any idea what they might have. He has spider programs running in most of the solar system's server hubs and does good business as a discreet information broker and as a wealthy low-volume spaceflight tech manufacturer, but his real business is finding out where the materials that made him possible came from; he considers himself the offspring of humanity and of whatever else is out there, and he's very curious about the absentee parent."
gametales,38watc,flaxeater,2,Tue Jun 23 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"It's so sad as GM that you can have these amazing NPC's and they will never understand or know what they've done, been doing and so forth.
