runningmusic,3cfk66,OtulGib,4,Tue Jul 7 19:31:23 2015 UTC,"When I seen this feature I was very excited about it and trialed it with the Punk playlist, which was alright. I say that because it seems like the songs aren't exactly the same BPM, so with each new song I would be a little out of synch, which threw me off a little, though I would end up getting back on pace.  My next run I did the Epic playlist and it went very good. Not super stimulating, but very consistent (as it seems it was just one very long song/composure). I do enjoy it, but sometimes just prefer a radio station of a band I like. I will likely use it once a week or so.  I must say I like it better than the Trailmix app, which would speed up or slow songs to match your tempo, which was inherently amusing in how it would distort your music to fit the bpm."
runningmusic,3cfk66,Four_give,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:56:48 2015 UTC,"I've only used the Epic and it was a very consistent. I put the BPM very low (I hadn't ran in awhile and didn't want to outpace myself). I'll check out a few others but it was more of ""I'm at the starting line, oh this is new..."" sort of thing. I have used the workout playlists with more traditional songs but none of them were specific to BPM.   The epic playlist shows up as ""Chapters"" and I could tell the differences but I'm sure there is more to it than that."
runningmusic,3cfk66,kisschicken,3,Tue Jul 7 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"I used the ""recommended for you"" and ""mood booster"" a few times. They're a nice change of pace from my regular running songs. Now that Spotify has AC/DC, I find myself just listening to that."

Many cycling clubs sponsor an annual century ride as both a social event for cyclists and as a fund-raiser for the club’s other activities. A sanctioned century ride is organized and conducted under the rules and liability protection of a sanctioning organization, such as the League of American Bicyclists. Sanctioned rides typically have rest stops every 25 miles or so, where water, food and toilets are available for cyclists. On a supported century ride, the route is patrolled by a sag wagon to assist riders with bicycle maintenance, or provide transportation back to the starting line for those unable to ride the entire course. Sanctioned rides are almost always supported.    Image i - A rest stop at a sanctioned century ride.

runningmusic,32fwes,Victor2Delta,2,Mon Apr 13 13:52:11 2015 UTC,Holy shit.   Running to this.   Would be insane.   And also remind me of high school.
runningmusic,32fwes,SupaGiraffe,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:31:57 2015 UTC,Same here brings back some good memories :)  My brother and me would co-op almost all of the Halos. Ah good times.
runningmusic,31gf5o,charmandermd,2,Sat Apr 4 21:06:31 2015 UTC,That guy in the red face paint is in the movie chappie isn't he? And this sounds a lot like the music and that was in that movie to.
runningmusic,31gf5o,blueinthesmurf,5,Sat Apr 4 21:58:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't seen the movie but he's definitely in it. Yolandi (the girl) is too."
runningmusic,31gf5o,blueinthesmurf,2,Sat Apr 4 22:18:04 2015 UTC,That's sick.
runningmusic,31gf5o,user_none,3,Sat Apr 4 23:36:40 2015 UTC,Ninja is what he goes by.
runningmusic,31gf5o,giant_earwig,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:51:42 2015 UTC,I've got quite a few of their songs on my running playlist. Love them!

runningmusic,31cxeb,CaptainDNA,3,Sat Apr 4 05:29:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Captain. That means a lot to me."
runningmusic,319ryr,permabitchface,2,Fri Apr 3 03:20:26 2015 UTC,"Interpol is one of my three favourite bands <3   This song is awesome for running. When 3:09 rolls around my adrenaline just starts flowing in anticipation of 3:55 and then I just want to sprint like hell.   Imagine this: PDA at the end of a long evening workout when you've gotten a runner's high, sprinting alongside a creek in August at 9:30 pm watching the sunset over the suburbs. Magical."

runningmusic,3197ka,johnaldrocks,1 point,Fri Apr 3 04:33:56 2015 UTC,Snakes for the Divine and Sons of Thunder are my top picks.

runningmusic,310pcg,ebosh,3,Wed Apr 1 04:54:57 2015 UTC,"Great pump up song, perfect as a walk out song too."
runningmusic,310pcg,Crazy8er,2,Wed Apr 1 06:13:27 2015 UTC,I have it for the end of my runs. Has a really good build up. It is one of those songs that when I heard it for the first time I loved it straight away.
runningmusic,310pcg,Crazy8er,1 point,Thu Apr 2 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"The build up is perfect, prepares you to just fire right up. It's something you can't help but want to move around to the beat"
runningmusic,30zea8,HanraHaNN,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:48:26 2015 UTC,Hello I was very bored and could not sleep last night. I have just started making music as a hobby and threw this together..I am a marathon runner and this speech always seemed to get me pumped before a big run. Suggestions are appreciated!
runningmusic,30y5t8,samvoss,2,Tue Mar 31 17:36:14 2015 UTC,That might have to be my new post-workout chill track.
runningmusic,30ux9n,BeerandFoaming,6,Mon Mar 30 22:27:30 2015 UTC,I've been listening to my gorillaz radio for the past few weeks. It gives me some good beats to run to :)
runningmusic,30ux9n,SellecksMoustache,5,Mon Mar 30 23:54:53 2015 UTC,"Confession:  I listen to a lot of K-Pop.    The music is usually very up-tempo, and I have no idea what the lyrics mean, so no distraction there."
runningmusic,30ux9n,bladel,3,Tue Mar 31 04:15:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of the AWOLNATION station. (heh, rhymed.) It's got some weird stuff on it, but it definitely gets me pumped. I've also recently gotten into ZZ Ward. She's a bit of a boss ass bitch and I love it."
runningmusic,30ux9n,ollietheotter,2,Tue Mar 31 03:43:39 2015 UTC,"I would generally say to listen to whatever you like to listen to. Personally, I run variously to ""Remember the Name"" ""Godsmack"" ""Tiesto"" and ""Bourbon Street"" (by Jeff Tuohy) more often than any other of my stations. Obviously I'm not looking for stations that are going to help me keep perfect pace, just things that I enjoy. Increase my speed on tracks that pump me up, and relax a bit on the more mellow songs."
runningmusic,30ux9n,GrinningJest3r,1 point,Mon Mar 30 23:32:27 2015 UTC,Classic Rock or 80s Rock always seems to do the trick for me.
runningmusic,30ux9n,PoonSlayingTank,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:45:59 2015 UTC,"Flying Lotus radio is pretty dank, if you're into that.   It's distance music, not speed."
runningmusic,30ux9n,justcamp,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:43:28 2015 UTC,Outkast/UGK station keeps me going. Bun B has one of the best cadences for running.

runningmusic,30inbx,bghanoush,3,Fri Mar 27 18:20:10 2015 UTC,I wish Tusk was longer so I could run to it for miles.
runningmusic,30inbx,ben1am,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:38:49 2015 UTC,Yes. Love those horns
runningmusic,30inbx,corylew,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:56:18 2015 UTC,And now I wait patiently for the person who takes the time to make a megaupload file of them.
runningmusic,30duzb,yeraveragejoe,2,Thu Mar 26 16:06:47 2015 UTC,"Good suggestion. Back when I was in much better running form, I use to listen the entirety of BtBaM's Color's on virtually every run. In Flames is some good running tunes as well."
runningmusic,309kaa,lunar_glides,2,Wed Mar 25 16:12:27 2015 UTC,"I've been obsessed with ODESZA running lately. It's Only is my power-song, especially when it breaks into this funky instrumental near the end."
runningmusic,309kaa,raerov,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"I like Odesza not to run to,  but a couple of their songs are on my running playlist."
runningmusic,309kaa,thrillliquid,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:28:56 2015 UTC,If you like odesza you would probably like Flume too. Both have great songs for running or just relaxing.
runningmusic,309kaa,swiifty,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:36:19 2015 UTC,"I like Disclosure and Singularity as well... Heard ""say my name"" so much and I don't even think it's one of their best tbh."
runningmusic,304oj8,UkuleleMadMan,3,Tue Mar 24 13:34:55 2015 UTC,Butterflies and Hurricanes by Muse always gets me going.
runningmusic,304oj8,eudaimonita,2,Tue Mar 24 23:29:36 2015 UTC,"Muse has a lot of great songs, fury, time is running out, panic station, survival. Just to name some of them"
runningmusic,304oj8,green1411,3,Wed Mar 25 01:54:21 2015 UTC,"This is my personal list I collected over the last few years but I found that everyone gets a rush from something different. Also, the feeling goes away for me and I have to find new songs constantly.  When I need an adrenaline dump any one of these songs get me going. If your in to techo or enjoy it I hear a lot of solid material in hardstyle (/r/hardstyle) might want to look that over too Motivational: dancing in the dark - Bruce Springstein, Arguru - Deadmau5, This Year - mountian goats , Aint No Grave - Jonhnney cash , Dash Board- modest mouse , I don't get tired - Kevin gates , Close your Eyes - Run the Jewels , Hardstyle Revolution - Abyss , Dead and bloated - Stone temple Pilots, Boomshakalaka - Chip the ripper , Flower - MOBY, I can't Stop - flux pavilion , Hash Pipe - Weezer  I will possess your heart - Death cab for cutie (good pacer for me) , City lights - method man , Faxing berlin - Dead mau5, Fire in your new Shoes - Kaskade ,  Adrenaline:  Can't Kill Us - The glitch mob , Bawitdaba - kid rock, The Pot- Tool, Bulls on parade - RATM, Holy Diver - Killswitch Engage , Superliminal _ Deadmau5 , Cochise - Audioslave, Bleed it out - Linkin Park ,"

runningmusic,304oj8,zaren,1 point,Wed Mar 25 10:49:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a slow runner, but I really like Animal Life by Shearwater. It has a build up that helps me get energized when I'm not feeling it. Also My Body by Young the Giant, and The Loneliness and the Scream by Frightened Rabbit."
runningmusic,304oj8,archifreak,0,Tue Mar 31 14:06:16 2015 UTC,"Motivational - Rudimental - Waiting all night  This is a great song for me, I usually have it near the end of my run to push me that bit more."

runningmusic,2zytm9,BigManRunning,2,Mon Mar 23 01:47:56 2015 UTC,I uploaded the scene in case anyone is interested: https://youtu.be/udn9zy8paXs
runningmusic,2zytm9,BrokenBaddest,1 point,Sun Mar 29 05:43:24 2015 UTC,Walking Dead run mix?  I'm assuming that means it was just used in TWD because this is the original and not a mix.
runningmusic,2zytm9,passingby,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"Yes correct.  In the most recent walking dead, a character picks up a burned cd that has 'run mix' written on it and plays this song for a few minutes."
runningmusic,2zq63y,soft-round,2,Fri Mar 20 18:34:14 2015 UTC,The whole of Total Life Forever is one of my faves to run to. Likewise their first album Antidotes. Cassius is so incredibly upbeat & always gives me a pick-me-up.
