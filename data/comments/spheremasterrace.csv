I'm done with grumpy flight attendants and annoying strangers. I hate waiting in line for security like a group of zombified sheep. I'm done experiencing other cultures and lifestyles.   I just want to stay home, complain about the dishes not being done and mow my damn lawn if it weren't for the damn ride-on breaking down every ten minutes! I want to be a regular at the local tim Hortons, where she gets my coffee ready for me before I tell her so we can spend two minutes making small talk (""omg, did you hear about so-and-so? What a spaz"")   That's about it. Maybe it says a lot about me that I don't really have a bucket list, but I'm pretty good where I'm at right now. I just flew across the country to go home, so that renewed my hate for flying for another 5 years.   What is your favorite national park? First national park? Have you ever had any close calls?"
spheremasterrace,3dhaab,NimblyJimblyNS,3,Thu Jul 16 10:23:38 2015 UTC,"Favorite: grand Tetons. But I've only been to 5 so not much to choose from  First: Grand Canyon.  Close calls: two that I can think of right away.   Camping trip with my sister and a friend, we decided to climb up a waterfall (not a good idea). My sister went first, followed by my friend then me. About half way up my friend slipped and fell down into me where he caught a rock and landed while pushing me down to a 15ish foot drop. I landed hard on my back but nothin broken, just a really bad bruise. Went white water rafting again with my sister and a different friend. At one point the raft went vertical and 3 other people and I fell out of the boat. They all fell away from the boat but I fell under it. I was under the boat for about a minute, I can usually hold my breath for a minute in a pool, but when you know you're stuck under a boat you panic a little and you go through breath faster. So after about a minute of going down some Rapids under the boat unable to pull myself out from under it due to the lifejacket pulling me up into the bottom of the boat I decided to unhook the jacket. This allowed me to go down a little more and swim to the side. When I finally came up I threw up some river water for a good ten minutes before realizing my knee was cut open pretty badly. The rafting guide pretty much just wrapped it tight in some gauze and pads and we kept going down the river (we were about 30 min away from the end) when we got there we drove me to the hospital where I got stitches in my knee.   And those are the two time in my life I thought I was going to die."

The joy about where I live is that I can visit Arches in spring before it gets too hot, and in summer visit Crater Lake just as the snow is finally melting only to return to Arches in fall when the weather cools down beautifully. I am no photographer but here is Arches and Crater Lake.   My first national park was Redwood National Park which I vividly remember as a kid. It taught me to foster a healthy respect for how kick-ass nature is at such a young age.   As for close calls, I mountaineer, mountain bike and road bike. I have close calls more often than not; I've managed to fall about 200 vertical feet while attempting a summit on the south Teton face. I've shattered my helmet more than three times mountain biking, pretty sure I got brain damage from one of them (lolz fuck me), and I've been hit twice by a car while riding my bike.

It's pretty fuckin' beautiful here. No close calls are coming to mind at the moment.   My friend in middle school Sam lived in a house with a backyard that led directly to the park. You exited his back gate and you were there. We used to hike around all the time. We found a neat little waterhole with murky water, and questionable things swimming in it even though it was disconnected from any creeks or tributaries, and we could find little pieces of quart/milky quartz on the ground sometimes. It's a pretty fun area.  These days we have a brewery that is the only one to use hot spring water or something like that. I've only been once, and their local brews weren't available yet, but I loved it. Here in about a week I'll probably go back and try the Hot Springs beer."

spheremasterrace,3dc152,JinjoTP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"I like the general layout, but do have two critiques:   It might be too easy to grab. There's a lot of open space around the flag and there's lots of pathways a flag carrier can go to escape the base. Maybe put a third powerup in the middle. I think maps with an odd number of powerups are more interesting (especially in competitive) because one team always gets more powerups than the other every powerup round."
spheremasterrace,3dc152,TeamTP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:29:03 2015 UTC,what do you mean too much open space? keep in mind that you'll usually have 2 defenders.  i've been thinking about a third powerup
spheremasterrace,3dc152,TeamTP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:48:17 2015 UTC,I mean there's a lot of open tiles (no walls or spikes around the flag) by the flags. This makes it easy to get a clean grab because you can come in from any angle. It also means that once you have the flag it's easier to leave base because there's lots of different routes you can go and the defenders can't possibly cover all of them.

spheremasterrace,3d0qsc,acrocanthosaurus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting map - I did figure out how to ""cheat"" on it.   As blue grab flag - go back to center portal enter from left to right, this will portal you to the black area ""behind"" the cap area. then you jest cross over the blacked out portal. Might need a wall or something.  I would also suggest a way to kill yourself near the tops maybe one more spike per side at the tops or in the center.  I would like to play this with 4v4 too see what else could be learned ... Cat Snake loves CF maps"
spheremasterrace,3d0qsc,Crazy_Ferret,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:30:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah the portal is just like that right now becuase I havn't edited them yet. Basically the mid portal will just be an exit portal, and the others will be instant so the 'cheating' problem will be fixed."
spheremasterrace,3d0qsc,B-Comp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:35:07 2015 UTC,"Few glaring issues  The team gates dont work for me with a button on the outside. Someone can camp that button and make you waste 10 seconds getting back to the FC everytime. 2ndly, if you hold the button for your FC and he gets in, it's a cap 95% of the time. A little too ez for my taste...i say keep the buttons on the inside. This might allow for some interesting teamwork, can see some suicide strats working well there  Bomb-gate feature is nice but i don't agree with the layout, it looks like it would be a great feature if it was implemented near the top - this could allow you to flush them to the other side as well as down in your gate. Where the bomb-gate is at now, it looks like you're going to send them right into the scoring tiles if they're right near the bottom bomb. try 3 bombs instead of 5 as well, this well reduce the likihood of an instant cap from a botched gate-bomb"

spheremasterrace,3cxtul,burnsc,2,Sat Jul 11 20:41:51 2015 UTC,"It needed to be flipped. The bombs favor one side.  Mid will be enraging with bomb spikes and flying into gates.  Team sides will become a 'control center' of such that one person camps to snipe if anyone tries to come in or to gate them.  A new strat would be turtlegating which would make for top post on /r/TagPro but not be fun if it happened to you when you have a team of someballs.  The portal leads you right into a gate if you go with any momentum.  I feel it will end up like a game of caravan stopping and making sure you have your powerup (practically guaranteed with the placement), make sure you have the button, boost, defused bomb, then go.    I'd suggest thinking of it like cloud and command center. http://i.imgur.com/vPNyjNE.png that's a quick edit to deal with mid, of course some grab things have changed, and I suggest incentive-ing the bottom."

spheremasterrace,3cd920,snowboo111,2,Tue Jul 7 16:23:17 2015 UTC,"Offense tends to win more because you're more in control of the game, not only because you're carrying the flag, but you likely will have a higher powerup % because you can time them when you're traveling to enemy base.   Playing offense also allows you to play offensive defense when needed. You can be the last line of defense to save a cap from happening or delay it long enough for your teammates to make it there."

spheremasterrace,3c15hx,sizviolin,2,Sat Jul 4 11:59:29 2015 UTC,Switch to a basic windows theme- Using an advanced theme with Windows aero killed my TagPro fps on my high spec desktop until we got it figured out.
spheremasterrace,3c15hx,NK_X01,2,Sat Jul 4 02:14:46 2015 UTC,"I had a ThinkPad a while ago. I faced similar issues with it. Does the fps change constantly or is it set to 35 fps without changing? You can try installing chrome portable. Another solution is to turn off all the extensions. No extensions worked for me on it very well, except for wins to level up and tp mod manager. Lemme know if these work"
spheremasterrace,3c15hx,NK_X01,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:11:44 2015 UTC,Chrome portable was a lot worse for me. Also turning off extensions and such didn't help. The ping varies from about 60 to 200. I don't want to continue tagproing like this.
spheremasterrace,3c15hx,NK_X01,2,Sat Jul 4 06:00:58 2015 UTC,"Well, ping is not a computer problem. Its an internet problem"

spheremasterrace,3c15hx,xKillaCuddleSx,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:45:54 2015 UTC,"Well, ping wise, did you change anything with your internet recently? Because ping shouldnt be different from what it was on your older computer. For fps, the graphics card is usually what makes the difference."

spheremasterrace,3bzlgn,Omidio,4,Fri Jul 3 15:31:47 2015 UTC,"we were told by E that there was at least one team that wasn't planning on participating in the tourney due to scheduling. hence the race for 9th that you saw. only after the competition ended did all of the captains start complaining about the dates and now they have rescheduled so as to appease the original 8 teams. we weren't fighting for 9th, we were fighting for a spot in the tourney, to the best of our knowledge.   also, you win dude. you win. we're out you're in, you did it. there is no need to keep rubbing it in our faces."
spheremasterrace,3bzlgn,oo_snap,-2,Fri Jul 3 15:45:59 2015 UTC,You passive aggressively private messaged me first and now you're playing the victim card.  Lol
spheremasterrace,3bzlgn,BallerOnABudget_,5,Fri Jul 3 16:22:48 2015 UTC,"i don't think it was passive, since i sent a message directly to you.   also, in that message i was claiming to be the victim. i'm not just playing it now, it is the only card i'm playing.   but none of this matters now, because you win and the teams are official. so there isn't any need to continue berating us about not being in the tourney."

I knew I was taking a risk by merely proclaiming that I was available even if the declaration was made in jest, but I must have felt so invigorated by the chance of freedom, however slim it may be, that I felt urged to comment on the post. I now deeply regret my decision, not so much because it caused you trouble, but more so due to the fact that Tantrew has recently discovered my plea and is now privately informing me that I will not talk to other people again.

Tantrew failed to save us? Interloper sucks? You decide.."
spheremasterrace,3b9kge,Altiger,3,Sat Jun 27 02:29:13 2015 UTC,The game always continues for a certain amount of time(~2 seconds) after the in game clock hits 0:00. You probably never noticed it because most pub games end as a result of the 3 cap limit being reached rather than the time running out.
spheremasterrace,3b9kge,JBaayBaay,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:05:05 2015 UTC,"No, I realize most games end with capture limit. The game clock should really stop counting scores after it hits zero imho. That goes for just about every game ever made with a clock."
spheremasterrace,3b9kge,psychfan5,2,Sat Jun 27 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"Well the TP game clock rounds up.  So if the clock reads 7:10, the actual time could be anywhere from 7:09.01 to 7:10.00.  I would suggest getting the Tagpro Milliseconds script if you don't like the clock as it is."

spheremasterrace,3b9kge,psychfan5,3,Sat Jun 27 03:34:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like the 75 flair is sort of luck based. You can't just be ""good"" at getting a good team in pubs. Theres alot of times where its damn near impossible to carry when you get a someball with 1tag and 20pops."
spheremasterrace,3b9kge,JBaayBaay,2,Sat Jun 27 06:19:39 2015 UTC,"It's a lot harder, but you have to capitalize on others mistakes. I may have gotten it becuase of luck, but others such as Altiger, Subglacious, NewCompte, ect. who get and maintain a win % of above 80 dont just keep getting lucky. They can truly perform at that level required to win 75% of the time."

I remember quitting for a few days cuz of him lol. Every juke against him is a triumph.  -Rburp: Solid defense, every match against him it's a challenge, rather have burp on my team.  -APthatsme (APthatsme.): Stupendous defense and very solid occasional offensive player, yeah he caps too! Formidable opponent.  -Duck (lilyloops): Elegant defense, keeps it simple while stacking those returns and tags, and damn she knows how to chase/snipe when things get out of hand! If she's in your team just focus on O.  -Devious: This guy is a bag full of surprises, mainly plays d, but he can easily juke the shit of you on his occasional offensive endeavor, stubborn chaser, watch out for him on d or o. You want this man in your team.  -D_Fender: This one lives up to his name, defense incarnated, you'll definitely have a bad time as an offensive player against him... His brother (Coopeh aka Yahtzee!) is secretly the better the player though.  -Yesthisisdog: One of my favorite players ever! Versatile as fuck, he  mainly plays D but can easily switch into O mode should the match require it, doing superb in both positions! You want jukes, snipes and loads of returns, this is the dog u want! Also best macros EVER!  -Trench: Trench rekts in defense, one of the best chasers I've met and her snipes are not too shabby either.  -Dr. Defense: This guy can carry your team easily, I've seen it! IVE SEEN IT!  -Arthur_Dent: I dont know if he is d or o, because he can play both! Always gives me a hard time, or a better one if he's on my team!  -Adam_Bomb: He rekts my shit most of the time, a phenomenal d Tagpro player all around.   Just some of my thoughts from the top of my head about a few defensive players.  I know I'm forgetting/not mentioning a lot of you like Jorge118, [burrito], Sunshine, and lots more! but i m sleepy, I enjoy playing with or against each one of you! I also did not mention some of the elder god tier players, but meh they already get the credit they deserve.   I'll maybe do Offensive players later.  -[burrito]: Earlier this year while I was in a bad spot emotionally, I kinda took refuge in tagpro for a while, playing mindlessly this little browser game was better than anything, I also used to post some embarrassingly stupid shit in the chat during that time, he replied to some of that stupid shit, thank you for that burrito.  -NimblyJimbly: When I was a sphereo tp babby, probably playing as Harbinger or el_Zorro or even earlier when I lurked as a sb, seeing your name in a match always pumped me up and I dreamed of being as good as you. It sucks your ping is not up to par nowadays, I know how that feels.  -Carabdis: I can count the # of times I've won against him in one hand, most complete player on sphere along with Altiger, me thinks, and probably of tagpro too. Elder god tier.   -Altiger: Altiger  -Tantrew: If planets align and my ping is not a piece of shit I may have a chance against him, I'll admit having him on my team makes me lazy though as I expect an auto win, lol.  -Lana.Del.Rey: lana play d... great offensive player, but damn she/he? can be mean, but we good now! <3  -Zarknox: Guy can cap, we have similar O play styles, whatever that means. we sometimes chat and it's awk as fuck.  -Calvinball: cavlin is a pretty cool guy, eh plays tagrpo and doesnt afraid of anything pls finish your movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3O1kudXkHs ... calv always give me a hard time.  -Taq: Taq is the chillest plsr of the land, he got the most varied macros you can find on tp, and he's been getting better! Taq STRONK!  -notsomeball: you are not a sphere resident i think, but damn u are annoyingly good at d and o, like damn seriously good.  -koala: close to elder god tier, sometimes i can win against her, opposing team's got to be completely incompetent though, always happy to have her on my team.  -anne frank: somehow almost never on my team, occasionally beat him, caps a whole damn lot, abuses his mod powers. Pls be on my team some time k tnx bye.  -dalek: not a sphere resident either, but damn, dalke is 2 good 4 me, dalek pls.  -xxBongRipxx: very competent d player, nice to have u on my team, mate.  -Jorge118: you once told me you learned from me... dude you are twice the defender I am.  -wmwtso: I recall being annoyed at this unpronounceable player cuz he was surprisingly good for his level, mamootso is that rare breed of mixed d and o capable tp player, ur 2 exotic 4 me m8.  -corbeh: exceptional player, best at o, has a quite good perception of the game flow, personally, very hard to beat.  -Team: I always have a hard time against Team, vulgarly good at O, like seriously good at O, about the level I expect to reach some day offensive wise.  -Fairy: I always admired your play style, always gives me a good match!  -slime666: satanic slime got the jukes, I've been embarrassed by this guy plenty of times. He's good and he knows it.  -samuraiseoul: I remember him from my early days too, great player all around, I heard from him first about this subreddit, thanks sam.   -crazy ferret: loony farret is 2 good at o, he underestimates himself sometimes but he's definitely better than me, quite the smurfing type sometimes. Catsnake ftw. BTW im the realest sanic.  -oh_snap!: totally OP, pls ban him, absolutely abhor him on the opposing team, elder god tier O player.  -Faye!: She knows how good she is, sometimes too annoyingly good, a name that stuck from my earlier days as a tp player too. Faye knows her shit.  -dat cap: omg what fucking disgrace is having this guy at d on the opposing team, holy shit pls. Elder god tier d guy.  -Atomic: forms a nice triad with the guys who usually rek my shit along with port and -messi.   --messi or toca bowl: fucking messi been wrecking my shit since I was a babby.  -port: him too, though he DCs a lot.  -][: Had the chance to pub with him a little, he deserves his legendary status. Elder. god. tier.  -BRISKET: muh occasional bro, always makes me hungry, quite good at everything on this game. Plus he waited 4 me at the nyan cat race event once. <3  -Ignitius: Maybe the best d player I've seen, when he was on the opposing team I used to just give up on that match, lol, elder god tier.  -SunShineGuy: pretty chill guy that makes your O life a hell on earth.  -pretroleum: where are u? Excellent defense, havent seen u in quite a good time.  -Texoccer: U too.  -Master Yoda: Best jukes I've ever seen on this game come from Yoda, always admired his O style since I started playing TP.  -Sansa Stark: my lady salsa can juke, when she's in the zone, sansa is unstoppable.  -srby: the original bomb guy, nuff said. WHERE ARE U MATE?  -carl?: or whatever his name is right now, he's a great defense!  -slothdefense a.k.a. allidoiswin a.k.a. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ a.k.a weird symbols guy: he used to bully me when I was the babby known as Harbinger (Hairbrainer), never got me upset really and just pushed me to be a better player and become sanic' or whatever. Used to constantly rek me, not anymore, not anymore. gg u annoying guy.  -**blue ----to be continued  Also super honorable mention to butts, the real butts though, bloody yanks!"

Akask Similar to Fats, i don't see him much but i love playing with him.  Starboard The first person i started saying hello to every time i saw him. Great player, love having him on my team. Fun defending against him.  Ignitius Probably one of the best players on sphere. Absolutely hate playing against him cause i know there's a good chance I'll lose. Great guy though.  [D] I don't know whose smurf this is, but he's fantastic. I've gotten him to say something twice now!  I feel like he is Altiger's defensive alt account.  Samurai Sam is great, always love playing with and against him.  Koala Way too good. Very difficult to play against, but very fun to play with.  -Messi/Toca Bowl This one is obvious.  Brisket Potentially the best macros around, plus he's an Aggie aero!  This is eleven people and i could go on for way longer, but this post would drag on. I love most people on sphere and love playing with you all. These are just the first that come to mind right now. Many honorable mentions: Tantrew, oh snap, burrito, slime, hithisisdog (second place for best macros), sunhine, sanic, devious, spjork, tangent (rip), port (centra scrub), carabdis (too good), trench, cstat, anne frank, apthatsme, and everyone else i regularly say hi to. Also shoutout to Black if you ever check this sub!   Edit: D_fender, nimbles, Cyanide, taq (pls) and interloper as well."

I'm only including people that I regularly run into in pubs...lots of great players that are too busy with competitive to pub much these days it seems.   slime666 - Consistently makes me look like a scrub when I'm playing defense. Faye - Holds for days and always finds a way to cap. Anne Frank - Great two way player. Tantrew - Never gets the credit he deserves, really good offensive player and does great on pups. DrunkDefense - Best pure defender on Sphere, hands down (glad to see in this thread that he is getting the recognition he deserves). Altiger - Wish I saw him pubbing more these days, he's the best possession offensive player I have ever seen. Adam_Bomb - I can never put my finger on what makes him so good but I find myself consistently losing against him. D_fender - He's getting really good. [burrito] - Very solid two way guy, strong on pups, always seems to be in the right place. Huevo - Hasn't been on as much recently but he plays great on both ends.  Extremely difficult to run down on defense."

spheremasterrace,3ahkmn,Altiger,4,Sun Jun 21 01:42:03 2015 UTC,"Hey! dods may not seem like a Sphero but he's not any different from the rest of us! Maybe he hasn't pubbed on Sphere for like ever and has never commented on a post here, but that doesn't mean he can't play alongside Sphere regulars, on the Sphere server, in a Sphere-based nightly tournament! Perhaps I'm mistaken, but did our founding Sphero, Tangent, not proclaim on that holy day that Sphere would forever be a server that is ""helpful, forgiving, and above all else, welcoming""? And if he were to learn that a friendly, non-Sphere player received any less of a welcome and glhf than any one of Sphere's regulars, would he not be outraged?? Perhaps I'm mistaken once more, but did our Lord and savior, samuraiseoul, not declare that a Sphero shall be ""full of good-natured heart from the very bottom of his or her pixelated ball to the very top, and everything in between""?? And from the first moment I laid my eyes on dodsfall's ball and heard his first, exasperated exclamation of ""pls"", I felt the presence of an altruistic ball filled with nothing but good-natured heart from the very bottom of his pixelated ball to the very top, and everything in between. A ball that has naught an evil pixel to be found and one who wishes desperately for others to merely accept him. To turn down his innocent request would be nothing short of heresy to /r/spheremasterrace 's name!  My sole request is for each and every one of you here to look upon dodsfall not as an ""outsider"" or a ""pi scrub,"" but rather as an amicable, dignified ""Sphero."""

spheremasterrace,39qw06,drewkungfu,4,Sat Jun 13 22:24:30 2015 UTC,"RocketPapaya is correct in the sense that you have to establish new contact. In order for the situation in the video to happen, I believe you have to already have established contact or make contact (and hold it) within the same frame of getting the flag. This also applies to people fighting for a tagpro.   I'm not sure what the exact amount of time is or how many frames of invincibility you have (when grabbing a neutral flag from a player), but as RocketPapaya said, all he had to do was move a pixel off of you and then re-establish contact and he would have gotten the flag."
spheremasterrace,39qw06,xKillaCuddleSx,2,Sun Jun 14 17:42:48 2015 UTC,"Stickyballs. You either have to make new contact with someone or (maybe?) hold contact for a long enough period of time to get a tag.  You can also see it sometimes when a pup fight happens over a tagpro. It's unintuitive but the correct move for Jorge here would have been to move away from Slime, just momentarily."
spheremasterrace,39qw06,RocketPapaya413,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:56:25 2015 UTC,Is there really a time limit? I was under the impression that a tag would not happen no matter what unless contact was broken.

Great little hometown diner, you should get yourself a chicken fried steak w/ a shake...McDonalds observatory is down the road, too so dont forget to check that out. There are some decent hiking trails around apline too, even a few behind campus. The area is rich with cats, coyotes and javelina so good chance you'll run into a bobcat or two. If you're lucky youll see a mountain lion, they are rare but definitely in that area.  You have to drink Lone Star first cause its the offical texas beer and it's cheap. Then you can move onto the finer microbrews ;)  PS Go to Big Bend before all the water dries up. Like asap. Or wait til it cools down"

BTW there are a few parks around you if you get bored one weekend. Balmorhea State Park is an absolute must visit. It's pretty much the best swimming hole in West Texas. Water is constant 72 degrees all year, its so damn nice - all spring fed. I grew up in Monahans (you probs passed through on your way in) and we have the Sandhills State Park there too. Great way to spend the day. Rent a sled and go explore the sand dunes. Its literally a giant sandbox."

Nicknamed ""The Russian Rocket"" for his speed,   Bure played for 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Vancouver Canucks, Florida Panthers and New York Rangers. Trained in the Soviet Union, where he was known as ""Pasha"",   he played three seasons with the Central Red Army team before his NHL career.  Selected 113th overall in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft by Vancouver, he began his NHL career in 1991–92 and won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's best rookie before leading the NHL in goal-scoring in 1993-94 and helping the Canucks to the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. After seven seasons with the Canucks, Bure was dealt to the Panthers, where he won back-to-back Rocket Richard Trophies as the league's leading goal-scorer (accomplished with Vancouver in 1993–94 as well, before the trophy's inauguration). Bure struggled with knee injuries throughout his career, resulting in his retirement in 2005 as a member of the Rangers, although he had not played since 2003. He averaged better than a point per game in his NHL career (779 points with 437 goals in 702 NHL games) and is third all-time in goals per game.  After six years of eligibility, Bure was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in June 2012.  Internationally, Bure competed for the Soviet Union and Russia. As a member of the Soviet Union, he won two silver medals and a gold in three World Junior Championships, followed by a gold and a silver medal in the 1990 and 1991 World Championships, respectively. After the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, Bure competed for Russia in two Winter Olympics, claiming silver at the 1998 Games in Nagano as team captain and bronze at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. Following Bure's retirement in 2005, he was named the general manager for Russia's national team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.  Bure was later recognized for his international career as a 2012 inductee in the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame.

A bit too pricey for me to go in for 10 bucks as an early access game, but I'll definitely keep an eye on it for when it's finished. It looks really pretty, and the trailer was well done. Great work!"
spheremasterrace,38uh7d,Aaron215,3,Sun Jun 7 01:49:33 2015 UTC,"Totally understandable!  Yep race, battle, and a bunch of modes we havent even thought of yet, if you are interested in the multiplayer it would be wise to hold off since its in a prettttttty rough state at the moment.

spheremasterrace,38uh7d,psychfan5,2,Sun Jun 7 01:11:23 2015 UTC,"sure,  Dark Souls inspired the difficulty of the game, punishing and not so obvious level layouts with lots of death!  Trials inspired our level progression system!"

You must collect a sponge (because you're summoning a scrub), an ancient silver talent (to symbolize that you're the only one bringing talent to the OFM), and of course, make sure the circle/pentagram is made from WD-40, like the real Tantrew's win %. Then step into the circle, call his name 3 times, and ascend to the astral plane. The rest is fairly simple, as juking Tantrew tends to be   TL;DR: 3 painfully forced jokes"

spheremasterrace,38rlzo,ThatChad1,6,Sat Jun 6 08:53:01 2015 UTC,"There are two main reasons I stopped playing D exclusively.   First is that there was that big push around the time rolling 300 started and I realized I can't carry a team full of nubs from the rear.   The main one is powerups. Most of the time if I spawn in a good position to get a far pup at start of game and type d in team chat then rush to get that pup, 2 balls will still assume I'm gone and stay d while I do that. So I swing back and there's 3 of us there and there's that long, awkward who's-gonna-go-o moment. So now I'm in the habit of just grabbing a pup and going o at the start of the game, and if I die and there are 2 people at home still, I'll rush off again. If not, I stay d.  It's vital to have people ahead and it's vital to get pups; in a pub going o is often the only way to ensure those things will happen."
spheremasterrace,38rlzo,TheNinjaCow,3,Sat Jun 6 11:07:19 2015 UTC,lol
spheremasterrace,38rlzo,badasscoming,3,Sat Jun 6 05:29:58 2015 UTC,"I actually don't mind. It does seem that less people are playing d now. A few months ago I remember complaining that too many people wanted to play d and I always got stuck playing o. That's not the case anymore. What sucks is when you don't have good players on o.  No matter how good you are on d, you can't win with a bunch of noobs on o. My win percentage sucks because of this. It's not a huge deal to me, I usually just play to pass time at work."
spheremasterrace,38rlzo,Dr_Defense,2,Sat Jun 6 14:06:26 2015 UTC,Same deal. Either people can't get out of base or I'm just really impatient now. And even when I get the flag lately... it takes like hours for people to get the returns... if they even get them. It has just been frusturating from both sides lately
spheremasterrace,38rlzo,aumisdabomb,3,Sat Jun 6 19:14:10 2015 UTC,Are u implying that Anne Frank is good?
spheremasterrace,38rlzo,turicanttouchthis,3,Sat Jun 6 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"Usually I stick back and only play defense, especially at the start of the game when everyone but me leaves the base. I'm pretty used to it and this point.  However, lately I've been playing games where a minute or two in the game multiple players on my team come back to base and play D, leaving only one person on offense. If I notice that we aren't making an attempt to always have someone on re or there are too many balls playing defense, I switch over to offense.   It looks like the same thing that is happening to you is what has been happening to me lately. Playing defense has its perks but it can be difficult to play by yourself. Next time it happens chat in team comments for ""Can I get someone else on D please?"". Most of the time if you are polite, I find that someone is willing to come back and play defense."

There is also a new team Paul Blart that just started.  Are you ever on Mumble and do you have a mic? If so you should start playing SOCL or just signing on while you pub...its the best way to get your name out there.  I've played lots of matches with you, you can definitely hold your own!"

spheremasterrace,37d91d,sizviolin,3,Tue May 26 19:53:14 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the friends list is causing weird lag spikes for me that I don't get when I disable it. I'll have no loss and 30 ping but one quick half-second-or-so cut in gameplay every minute or two with no changes in loss/ping.
spheremasterrace,37d91d,wataqo,2,Tue May 26 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"Ooh that might be it! I'll try disabling, but I could have sworn it was happening before a couple days ago. It still could be that causing additional problems, thanks."

I did try to test on incognito when I first started having issues, but I must have also been having server issues at that time causing the false positive.   Thank you so much guys for all your help!!"
spheremasterrace,37d91d,wataqo,1 point,Wed May 27 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"I had a possible temporary fix so that you don't have to log out/disable the script, but it might not actually be working to stop lag. In case you or anyone wants to play with it:   Inside the TagPro Friends script on lines 3-5 are the pages where the script is included. * is a wild-card representing any combination of characters. If you change the * at the end of line 3 to a / , the script will only be included on the home page.   I think the refreshes might still happen in game as long as you're logged in, but I'm not sure I might just have been having issues.   You might also add another @include line for /groups/* or something.   Or hey we can just ask /u/Lej about it."
spheremasterrace,37d91d,burnsc,2,Wed May 27 01:39:02 2015 UTC,"Did you update to the 2.2 that I released today? Because 2.2 had a MAJOR issue in it that I'm actually still working on right now. I pulled it down because it wasn't QUITE ready yet. Also did you have it minimized while playing?!? It doesn't load anything at all while minimized. If it's open, then it's constantly polling my server for friend updates."
spheremasterrace,37d91d,Slime666,1 point,Wed May 27 03:17:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know whether it updated, but the lag has been happening since at least yesterday -- I had to disable it for NLTP tryouts. My version thing currently says 2, last updated 5h ago.  Ya, I always have it minimized while playing, idk about Fairy. I think the lag thing is only stopping once I'm logged out.

spheremasterrace,37d91d,Lej,2,Wed May 27 04:46:58 2015 UTC,Try disabling all user scripts / extensions / add ons and then add on one at a time.  Try to see if it is one of them.  (I don't use friends list coz massive lag)  Plug your computer into your router via Ethernet cord many times wifi causes lag.    Technology can send signals that messes with wifi (my printer and smart TV)

While we host some of the best players in the game, let us be known more for the way we treat other people. Act such that we won't have to force players to bow to us, but instead show them why they should want to be among us. For a man will hold tightly to his cloak no matter how hard the wind blows to try to force it away from him, but he will easily part from it should the sun only calmly shine upon him.

I taught him the basics, let him do his thing, then I kept hearing him say ""oh snap!"" so I decided to check in on his game. Apparently he was on a team with oh_snap and would exclaim ""oh snap!"" anytime he showed up on the screen (which was happening every 10 seconds). He got bored with TagPro because it was too hard but did not get bored of saying oh snap! for the next 24 hours.  TL;DR oh_snap unintentionally infiltrated my life through TagPro"
spheremasterrace,36ra14,B-Comp,5,Thu May 21 17:09:25 2015 UTC,"I say ""oh snap!"" every time I see oh_snap because I know I'm about to get rekt. Hmm maybe that's why he called himself oh snap..."

I taught her the game a few weeks ago and she'll play it sporadically, but only as a someball.

Look into paleo dieting or some modified form of it. Combine that with 30 minutes of cardio exercise everyday and you will see results. Drink a lot of water.

If you want to lose weight just try smaller portions for meals. Doesn't have to be a specific diet fad as long as you are eating a healthy. Basically burn more calories than you take in.

This is my commandment: to love as I have loved you.  Kneel to wash each other's ball as I have done for you.     All the game will know you are my disciples  By the love that you offer, the kindness you show.  You have heard the voice of God in the words that I have spoken.  You beheld heaven’s glory and have seen the gameplay of God.     I must leave you now only for a moment.  I must go to the Father to make you a home.  On the day of my return, I will come to take you with me  To the place I have promised where your joy will have no end.     I am like a vine you are like the branches.  If you cling to my teaching you surely will live.  If you make your home in me, I will come to dwell within you.  You can count on my mercy when you ask for what you need.     I have called you friends, now no longer servants.  What I told you in secret, the world longs to know.  There can be no greater love than to give your life for others.  As the Father has loved me, so I love you as my own.     You will weep for now while the game rejoices.  But the tears of your sorrow will soon turn to joy.  As a mother cries in childbirth and her pain is turned to gladness,  You will know great rejoicing on the day of my return.     I will give you peace; this will be my blessing.  Though the game churns around you, I leave you my peace.  I have told you all these things that my peace may dwell within you.  Let your faith be unshaken and your hope ever strong."

spheremasterrace,35qpy1,Blackchaos93,3,Tue May 12 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"I like to think of TagPro (pubs in particular) as being an abstract interpretation of Mad Max. You roll around a desolate landscape, hoping against hope that your meager forces are strong enough to withstand the environment around you. Your enemies are deadly, arming themselves with any and all weapons they can find. Your allies are few and unreliable. You have a goal, and there will be murder and mayhem along the way, but at the end, you'll have to wonder if you've changed.  Max: I'm scared, Fif. You know why? It's that rat circus out there. I'm beginning to enjoy it. Fifi: What is this, bonny week? Max: Look. Any longer out on that road and I'm one of them, you know? A terminal crazy Some Ball... only I got a bronze badge birthday hat to say I'm one of the good guys.

spheremasterrace,35omwv,seaslug1,2,Fri May 15 03:57:52 2015 UTC,"Stay plsy, my friends."
spheremasterrace,35mmax,OG_Diddles,3,Mon May 11 19:18:47 2015 UTC,It could be like a four corners type of game.   This is probably gonna be formatted shitty but imma try anyway    |   RF                       BC    |  |   RC                       BF    |    RF= red flag RC= red capture  So red would have to go diagonally to get blue flag and then go horizontally to get red capture. If that makes sense?
spheremasterrace,35mmax,squirtle6,1 point,Mon May 11 22:42:16 2015 UTC,"No that's actually a pretty good representation, of have is with both cap and flag on the same side just different parts on the same side."
spheremasterrace,35mmax,squirtle6,1 point,Tue May 12 05:27:02 2015 UTC,This is kinda what we did for my soccer team in high school to practice possession. I loved it then. I feel like it could be a pretty fun game in TP with the right instruction and understanding of strategy.
spheremasterrace,35mmax,burnsc,1 point,Tue May 12 07:22:55 2015 UTC,I wanna play real life tagpro...
spheremasterrace,35mmax,burnsc,3,Wed May 13 04:45:24 2015 UTC,"Teams are too small I person to defend your flag, one person to defend capture zone, then I suppose two on offense.    Also tagpro (as is) isn't capable of it.  You'd be able to bring the enemy flag back to your flag to cap not just the zone"
spheremasterrace,35mmax,burnsc,1 point,Mon May 11 22:58:40 2015 UTC,"Ya that's what I figured about the capping situation. This is one reason I would love tagpro to experiment with different team sizes such as 5v5, not really 6v6 cuz I feel like in 95% of the maps 6v6 would be hell, even 5v5 would be, but what if there were only certain maps that allowed 5v5 like this? I feel like it could be a competitive 5v5 game mode, 2 flag D, or 2 zone cap D, with 1 on the other, or vise versa, and 2 O."
spheremasterrace,35mmax,oo_snap,1 point,Tue May 12 05:31:31 2015 UTC,"It would definitely mix up the game, because depending on the enemy team you can mix it up 3o or 3d.  I feel competitively it would be fun, but in pubs the map would have to be very structured in order to keep it from getting very chaotic."

spheremasterrace,35lqol,ArcticFrankie10,1 point,Mon May 11 16:51:27 2015 UTC,"Depends on how good the other FC is, whether or not my team has re, how many opposing players I'm past, etc.  If I don't intend to go for the kiss, then it depends on how close I am to getting tagged. If I'm pretty close, I'll just charge ahead and hope that he moves out of the way, whereas if I have time, I'll reverse momentum and accelerate in a direction perpendicular to my current trajectory to try to avoid the kiss as much as possible."
spheremasterrace,35lqol,Rocket_Sciencetist,1 point,Mon May 11 16:00:01 2015 UTC,"yeah pretty much this.  very situational.    if i could kiss someone who is a good fc and my team is having trouble returning, i usually will.  or if i grab and their fc is in their base i'll usually try to kiss until we can get re instead of trying to escape.  if i know they will be a fairly easy return for my team i'll avoid them and try to head closer to base.  i dont really mind kissing when it isnt necessary, but there's always the chance that re could get popped right after grabbing so i try to avoid unnecessary kisses (unless the other fc is better than me and it's smart to take them down)"

spheremasterrace,357ofh,ArcticFrankie10,2,Thu May 7 20:21:12 2015 UTC,...yea bring some tortillas and fry those grasshoppers.
spheremasterrace,357ofh,9whiteflame,3,Thu May 7 22:37:48 2015 UTC,"Wait, are you backpacking or car camping? Cause that'll make a huge difference.  I'm going to assume backpacking, but if you're car camping, you can make some seriously awesome meals.  K, probably want light weight items, but since it's only a day, you can pack more than if you were on a full backpacking trip. For breakfast, I recommend pancakes, liquid eggs, etc. You might even be able to do breakfast burritos with some dehydrated beans, liquid eggs, tortillas, etc. Alternatively, a big bowl of oatmeal with fruit is delicious and will pack the nutrients you'll need for the day.  For lunch/snacks, I'd bring a couple pbj's. For some reason, I hate pbjs unless I'm backpacking, in which case they are the most delicious things on earth. If you premake them, they're light and don't take to much space. Pack some bananas, oranges or apples to compliment the sandwhich, and bring some snacks like trailmix or cliff bars to munch on. And make sure you pack enough water, 1-2 liters at least.   Chances are you'll have the most time for dinner, so I always like to make it good. Some ideas: hotdogs and burgers, soup, quesadilla's, cast iron pizza, packaged noodles (fettuccine, spaghetti, mac'n'cheese, etc), fresh caught fish, ramen, hobo meals (potatoes and stuff seasoned in tinfoil and put under coals), etc. Two things I like to do that I learned as a kid are roasted apples, and bread on a stick. For the roasted apples, just spear one and cook it nice and slow near the coals. Its like apple pie. For bread on a stick, just grab some Pillsbury crescents/biscuit dough, wrap it around a stick, and put it over the fire. It's delicious.  If you're car camping, go all out. The majority of the best meals I've had were cooked over a nice fire."

Make a packet out of tin foil, throw in some chunks of ground beef (or any meat), cut up onions, peas, carrots, garlic and potatos (or any vegetables), salt, pepper, and some olive oil.  Stick it right on some dying coals and turn every now and again.  Make sure to bring oven mitts or tongs.  If you're really lazy or you just want an easy backup in case a meal doesn't turn out for you, you can open a can of soup most of the way (keep the lid covering the top of the can) and stick it next to the fire until it's hot.  Avoid condensed soups if you go this route.  This is a good way to do baked beans as well."

You can buy these bisquick pancake mixes at the store where you add fresh water and shake it up and you have pancake mix, just bring some good syrup! as for lunch, if you do not have a fire, I recommend crackers, cheese and summer sausage. It will fill you up and won't take up much room in your pack. If you need extra sustenance, I recommend bringing a lot of almonds to snack on for sustained energy."

If so, GO THERE and get trailmix ($2.49 for a pound bag) and smart bars (basic protein bars).  You will not be able to beat the prices for good energy snacks.  As far as dinner goes, we always make ""hobo steaks"" when we go camping, but a cooler would be required...it may be a night one dinner.    Set out tin foil, about 1.5 feet squared. Cut onion into slices, place one slice of onion per sheet of tin foil Cut potatoes into small chip like slices, and layer a few of these over the onion. Mix together ground beef, A1 sauce, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Paprika. Ball up beef and make into patties, almost like a hamburger Put beef patty on top of onions and taters Layer more taters on top of beef Close the tin foil so that it is nice and sealed.    Make these the day before and toss in fridge/cooler (all of it still raw).  Beautiful thing about these, dont have to have a grill or nothing just flame.  Pop the lil buggers on the edge of the fire (I typically find a big stone and place that over half the fire about 30-45 minutes before cooking).  They will take about 30-45 minutes to cook, AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE COOKED THROUGH (if u have a thermometer, 165 degrees F) or u gonna be hiking and pooping at the same time...i guarantee it.  Goes great with a lil ketchup, get the jalepeno ketchup to KICK IT UP A NOTCH....BAM!!!"

Pasta meals are tasty, but are just carbs and not quite as filling as you would typically want on a trail. They can be made much better if you have some frozen meat that you will let thaw in your sack on the hike. If you'll be out longer and need meat, jerky or small chilli/soup cans are a good alternative. I also suggest some trail mix or protein bars during the hike to keep your energy up."

She is a pretty state, and has sights you will won't find anywhere else. Enjoy Zions NP, it is perhaps the most stunning and surreal landscape I have ever seen. Arches is a wonderful NP, I highly recommend driving in early morning and hiking the full Devil's Garden trail. When I say full, it is 7 miles and includes some moderate to difficult terrain but it is well worth the extra steps. Save Delicate Arch for sunset, you will not regret it. I also have a free campsite I could provide directions to that will allow you access to Arches NP for free provided you have a 4 wheel drive car.  A few words of warning about visiting Utah in the middle of summer, especially our south desert. It will be HOT, temps regularly go above 110 degrees (and there is no flair for that). Plan on doing your outdoor activities early, and being done early. I really can't stress how hot it will be, I avoid going to Moab from June-August because of it.   If you get a chance, stop by Salt Lake City and take a short drive up our mountains. For a few bucks you can find yourself on top of a 11,000 foot peak without breaking a sweat.   Anyways, I can answer a lot of questions about the west. I have travelled all over it, hiked, biked, camped and skied a lot of it. :)  Oh, and Banff will blow your mind."

spheremasterrace,3548ry,Creothcean,1 point,Thu May 7 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  We're planning on spending more time in Utah than any other state.  I've figured that it can't be worse than New Orleans in the summer, but I may be wrong about that.  Have you been to the Dinosaur National Monument?    Unfortunately this is my car, so I limited offroading abilities.  If I could reach the campground I'd love directions."

spheremasterrace,3548ry,psychfan5,2,Fri May 8 03:18:20 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend visiting some of New Mexico if its not too far off the path. Roswell, Santa Fe, Carlsbad Caverns, Guadalupe National Park are some of my favorite places I've visited out west. Carlsbad is unbelievable to see (watching the bats leave at night to feed is a surreal experience  I would spend an entire day at Arches if you can. It's a good trip from Moab but there are so many different arches/rock formations you should see that I would plan an entire day to see a good portion of the park.  Hovenweep National Monument is pretty good place for hiking and learning alot about Navajo culture, not too far from Mesa Verde. There was a wonderful German Restaurant I visited a number of years ago near Mesa Verde that was phenomenal, I'll see if I can rummage through the photos and figure it out. A bit out of the way from Mesa Verde but on your way from Durango to Rock Mountain NP you should visit Great Sand Dunes National Monument. Really surreal seeing giant sand dunes if you've never seen them. You can climb on them and slide down them.   Grand Tetons are probably among the most beautiful landscape I have ever seen. Recommend doing some hiking around there before you head to Yellowstone. Watch out for National Park Police/State Highway Patrol. I got a ticket for going 5 over on that road from Grand Tetons to Yellowstone.  Moab is awesome, plenty of shopping, cool restaurants, funky/hippy feeling. I canoed on the green river and would encourage any type of canoeing/kayaking in the area if you can.   Wall Drug is cool to stop at but honestly I wouldn't go out of the way to see it. Its right off I-90 so I guess if you go to Rushmore on your way back if you take I-90 it is worth a stop. Plenty of free ice water and tacky souveniers.   PM me if you are curious about any other details. I've been all over New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, W. Texas, etc."
spheremasterrace,3548ry,Dr_Defense,1 point,Thu May 7 02:52:39 2015 UTC,Hijacking to ask- Have you been to Big Bend Nat. Park? I'm moving to Alpine for the summer and i'm trying to figure out just how excited I should be about the hiking there.
spheremasterrace,3548ry,TeaCrusher,1 point,Thu May 7 03:32:42 2015 UTC,"That's where i'm going over next christmas break, I've heard theres great hiking especially during the winter months. I've seen lots of picture and it looks really nice too."
spheremasterrace,3548ry,9whiteflame,1 point,Thu May 7 05:33:07 2015 UTC,No my parents went there in their RV this past year. Said it was real pretty and isolated. They did quite a bit of hiking there and really enjoyed it. From the pictures they showed me they had a fun time.
spheremasterrace,3548ry,Brucho,2,Tue May 12 04:40:32 2015 UTC,"I can comment on the last leg of your trip.  Mt.Rushmore is neat, but I don't think the park enhances the visit other than getting you a few hundred feet closer than you would from the Highway. That area is going to be FULL of motorcycles at that time of the year. Sturgis will be going on the 3rd through the 9th of august, but there will be traffic for about a week before that, and a good week afterwards. I liked Custer, but i wouldn't recommend it during sturgis week, and you'll probably have your fill of buffalo. Driving into sturgis would be fun if you're there during the rally- otherwise its a ghost town.  The badlands are very cool. You can take 44 out of Rapid city for a nice drive. Otherwise I would Hightail it on 90 back home. If you do take 90 back, you'll cross the Mississippi in Lacrosse. There are beautiful bluffs there and a few hours south there is the home of Aldo Leopold. Devils Lake State Park as well (which is one of the sights he writes about).  Now I'm Biased, but if you're in Wisconsin, you need to eat some cheese and drink some beer. If you come through Madison on a Saturday morning (which you should) you absolutely should come to the capitol square for the farmers market. before heading home.  One last thing. My favorite restaurant I've ever eaten in is a small little Ethiopian diner in Fort Collins, CO (on I25 north of Denver) it's called Raskas. Its a crap-shoot as to whether it will be open as the owner is often in Ethiopia for part of the year, but she makes the best food I've ever eaten. I would definitely recommend it if you are in that part of the state, + I just really like Fort Collins as a city.  That looks like an amazing itinerary. You'll have a blast. Feel free to PM me about your final leg, as I've seen most of whats between Lake Michigan and Rapid City"
spheremasterrace,3548ry,Brucho,2,Thu May 7 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"Hey Fats! I live in Boulder, so I've got a couple recommendations for you. 1st, Lake Helena at sunset (RMNP) is absolutely gorgeous. You can hit it on the way from Bear Lake.  If you are up to it, Grey's and Torreys is a decently easy pair 14's. If you get started by 9 am and keep a decent pace, you can summit by noon or so, depending on how active you are. When I went, people were running up and down it. The elevation won't be pleasant for your lungs though.  Boulder has a bunch of local breweries that do tours/tastings etc, and some good restaurants too. I'm a broke grad student, so I can't help you out to much there.  Glenwood Springs is a cool town on I70 to Salt Lake. Zion is a must do, I recommend hiking the Narrows and Angel's Landing. Be sure to visit Bryce as well.  Mnt Rushmore is cool if you're driving by. Don't plan on spending long there though, 15 mins is adequate to take in the monument, and if you do the entire walk/ read all the signs it might take you a really boring hour.   Lake Louise is also awesome, but get a hotel in advance, it's expensive. Probably don't stay at the Chateau, unless your loaded.  Congrats on the wedding! - Ignitius"
spheremasterrace,3548ry,Brucho,3,Thu May 7 04:34:01 2015 UTC,"Coloradoan here to chime in with my two cents:  What he said. Though, depending on when you go I highly recommend starting 14ers earlier in the day. Lightning on the peaks of those mountains is nothing to trifle with and it stinks to spend a few hours hiking up only to be driven off before you summit by huge black clouds rolling in that can kill you. It's no joke.   As for breweries. the best in my opinion in the Boulder area is Oskar Blues (which is in Lyons so it's an easy stop as you are heading to/from Rocky Mountain National Park). Great beer and some of the best food a brewery can offer."
spheremasterrace,3548ry,Brucho,2,Thu May 7 14:03:04 2015 UTC,"Heya Fats. I love in Arvada, which is a suburb of Denver... excellent!  Anywhoo, I am happy to answer any questions you may have or give any guidance. Let me know your generals on your way through Colorado and I can pin-point some must dos in the areas. Feel free to pm me and I will get back with ya! Congrats on the wedding!!"
spheremasterrace,3548ry,wataqo,1 point,Thu May 7 14:05:43 2015 UTC,"Ty ty!  I'll likely get at you for some more advice, but one thing I've been wondering is whether it's worth it to hit some more cities in CO.  We're much more interested in hiking and camping then seeing metro areas, but I've heard many good things about Colorado Springs, Durango, Boulder, etc.  As of right now, we're pretty much only going to be in the heart of the Colorado Rockies and the SW of the state.    Is it worth checking out some of these cities?  For example, going to Colorado Springs and then checking out Garden of the Gods?    We have friends in Denver, but I haven't begun looking up stuff to do there.  Assuming we're only in Denver 48 hours or so, what are some things must do?"
spheremasterrace,3548ry,Its_Frosty,2,Thu May 7 18:05:12 2015 UTC,"Some are out of the way, and some are on your way so you might get a chance to see them without devoting much time to the urban areas. Let me explain...  Boulder (Pearl Street specifically) is worth a stop if you check out that specific area. You will likely have to pass through if you are going to the Estes Park entrance of Rocky Mountain Nation Park anyway. There are also a few great breweries to check out. Boulder has some great hikes just west of downtown and the Chatauqua hikes are the best.  Denver, this can easily be skipped and imo is not worth a stop. Just pass on through and marvel at the amusement park located right next to downtown! If you are staying in Denver... we have some wonderful restaurants. My favorite Denver restaurant is the Buckhorn Exchange. I guess it is worth noting that Red Rocks is for sure worth a look. It's west of Denver so not in the metro area but is close.  Colorado Springs is beautiful and if you are going to the Garden of the Gods (recommended) then you will pass right on through. I wouldn't stick around too long in the Springs because there is so much to do right next door in the mountains so check out the Garden and alos drive to the top of Pikes Peak for a quick and easy 14er!  I don't know a lot about Ft. Collins. I do go up there once a year with the wife and we ride our bikes from brewery to brewery which is a blast. O'dells is an awesome brewery there.   I hope this helps give you an idea!"
spheremasterrace,3548ry,wkdus03,2,Thu May 7 18:59:23 2015 UTC,"Some mountain towns I recommend in the State... Crested Butte, Steamboat Springs, Telluride, Vail and Breckenridge."
spheremasterrace,3548ry,Slime666,2,Thu May 7 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"I used to live not too far across the provincial border from Alberta, so here's some advice from a real live Canadian:  If you like skeletons, fossils and/or dinosaurs, don't miss the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller.  Also in Drumheller are hoodoos, which... idk, I guess they're kinda neat.  And if you do end up in or near Calgary you should check out their version of the space needle for the DAMN AMAZING VIEW clear out to the Rockies.  There's also this place if you're into that sort of stuff. Wasn't a very exciting visit imo, but some people dig that sort of stuff.  Banff is a great choice.  Also, I definitely recommend that Arizona extension. The area around Flagstaff, the Grand Canyon, etc. is beautiful. And even given the time of year, heat isn't too brutal 'til you go into lower elevations. And check out one of them lava parks in that area."

spheremasterrace,34s90d,samuraiseoul,4,Mon May 4 03:48:30 2015 UTC,"But when you do have lag and screw up a move because of it, it sucks to think people think you are bad. It's even worse when people think you did it on purpose. I was playing a game a few days ago, and I was lagging a ton (particularly in the beginning of a match for some reason), and apparently I was bumping into my fellow defender for a while. So he decided to purposefully knock into me instead, letting an opposing ball escape, and said ""how do you like it?"" It was very frustrating."
spheremasterrace,34s90d,psychfan5,1 point,Mon May 4 04:32:26 2015 UTC,"yeah, I mean that's really where the whole problem is; if we are lying about the lag or not.

He is the sanctifier of souls, the helper, the comforter, the giver of graces, and leads people to the Father and to the Son. By his mercy and grace, Spheroes receive his fruits and gifts. He has spoken through your prophets.  Together, we are three persons, co-equal and co-eternal, in one God. All who were existent at the beginning, we are adored and glorified and named LORD, the Alpha and the Omega, Jehovah.

Yeah we figured that out when you grabbed 15 times in the game and averaged only 3-5 seconds per carry.  I've never really had a problem with our core group of players to be honest. Some people take the game too seriously and try to get under your skin.  The ones that do that usually come off as 15 year old nerd ragers so I tend to find they are easy to ignore."

spheremasterrace,345rcu,soonergooner,2,Tue Apr 28 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"This is definitely the kind of behavior I've been seeing since the patch. Lots of people I've never seen before just spamming ""this team"" and ""PLS"" over and over at newbies when they mess up and then blaming the whole team post-game. It's not outright name calling but it's still discouraging to new players who are trying their hardest.  I hope it stops. It kills the lighthearted mood of what should be a fun game."

Many times players will be banned immediately for using language like that, but I chose to warn you first. Saying ""nah"" led me to believe you did not intend to change without seeing what was possible under our TagPro's current rule set.  I'm glad you've picked up our game recently. and I hope to see you stick around, but you need to realize that here, and especially on Sphere (the server you were on), that hate speech and being unkind to fellow players is not accepted. Sphere is very active in keeping it's culture friendly and welcoming, so if you treat this as XBox Live, you'll find yourself not playing very much. Keep it friendly and you shouldn't have a problem.

spheremasterrace,341fey,turicanttouchthis,2,Mon Apr 27 17:21:23 2015 UTC,Why should I play defense?
spheremasterrace,341fey,BRISKET_PLS,2,Mon Apr 27 17:22:58 2015 UTC,P.s. hi cstat
spheremasterrace,341fey,psychfan5,2,Mon Apr 27 17:24:20 2015 UTC,It allows you to see how more experienced players go for grabs so you can try them out whenever you go on offense. Play what you wanna play though. I'm just trying to pull you to the D side muahahaha
spheremasterrace,341fey,BRISKET_PLS,2,Mon Apr 27 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"I mostly play D because I suck at offense, but I want to be good at offense so bad!"
spheremasterrace,341fey,johnm21789,2,Mon Apr 27 17:51:51 2015 UTC,Neutral flag maps will give you more opportunities to play o the better you are at d. Then you can get better at o and those opportunities will last longer.  Center flag is probably the only reason I can get a cap now and then in non-center games.

Um, and then I watched a 60 second video.  And then I played forever.  I am always trying to quit but I canT.  I liked capture the flag on halo and stuff, and  I played this game marble madness on Nintendo as a kid.  This is like those."

spheremasterrace,341q9c,Brucho,2,Mon Apr 27 19:18:41 2015 UTC,I hope they implement some good chat/community support so people can stick together. It definitely won't feel the same to constantly play against random players you've never seen before..
spheremasterrace,341q9c,AngryCircusBear,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"Really it looks like we'll still be playing each other a lot. The matchmaking puts you in the closest server, or puts you in a preferred location. So say you want to play Sphere but you just decided to up and move to the middle of the Yukon or whatever, you still can. Those of us who still live around Sphere will still be in the same games."

PMs only please, so I see them.  I won't get it right away, but I'll check out every one of them, and warn them in game if they're on and it's warranted.   Time to clean up Sphere. Again.

I like round objects and enjoy spaces like sphere for being the ultimate round shape.  I love bringing flags of red & blue colors together.  I like to pop, but not be popped. I also hate spikes in all forms: map shapes, ping, & loss %.  I some times play wearing an Oculus Dk2 with virtual desktop as I have them on and play between rendering work stuff.  I'm from Austin, TX and most of what I do for a living is in cloud server space. Hence the name.   I enjoy the community like I've never have had enjoyed an online community before.   I'm not a great player, but I try my best.  I'm on TP to having fun. And I seriously do try my best to support the team & win."

I'm probably one of the worst players on the server, but where I lack in skill I do my best to make up for with my personality. Like you, I don't get ideal ping on sphere. I usually hover around 100 ping but sometimes it goes up to 300+. I get only 5 ping on centra if you ever want to play a bit on a closer server with a friend. I like tagpro because it has simple mechanics and when I first started it was a lot easier for new players to learn the game and improve their skills. I'm from Australia, but I went traveling for 18 months after high school before moving to San Francisco."
spheremasterrace,33uxpc,wyldcrater,2,Sun Apr 26 00:10:04 2015 UTC,"Ver you are definitely not one of the worst players on the server, I think you're quite the offensive player with a good sense of what's happening in the game!   Also I had no idea you are from Australia! TIL :D where did you go for your travelling trip and what was your most memorable place?"

spheremasterrace,33uxpc,rice_friskies,5,Sun Apr 26 01:17:23 2015 UTC,"Why did you decide to play on Sphere rather than Centra? Not that i'm complaining, just wondering."
spheremasterrace,33uxpc,sanicfromsphere,3,Sun Apr 26 03:36:09 2015 UTC,"When I first started playing, Origin was the server to play on. After numerous Tagpro pushes however, its quality quickly declined. I still played on Origin it just wasn't as fun as it used to be. Then I heard about Sphere, probably from you, and decided to check it out. I suppose I could have just as easily decided to go play on Centra, but someone was talking about Sphere. I haven't played a public game on Centra in ages, but I think I'd still rather play here."

She doesn't respond with anything meaningful for a reason and she's not interested in you. Who am I? The man whom she is in love with. She already told me not to worry, she's not interested in you. Sorry I bothered you kid. I've dated her since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my woman or being inappropriate I don't care if you snap her occasionally. Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me. We are in love and we're making love tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with my woman you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best she's ever had, only man she's ever loved and the only man who could truly satisfy her physically. You will never have her. And she loves me. I don't have any problems with you if you are over my woman and realize you will never be with or touch her again. I apologize for coming off as a dick, just me and kenna are really deep in love and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man she used to date before me is snap chatting her.... We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask friend. If you try to talk to her any way but as a brother, or you try to see her at all, if she tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict brother like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem. I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the woman who I love and whom is in love with me. That entire summer she was with me. She left kyle for me. She's been with me ever since, she even loved me and made love to me before she EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please her. She didn't have strong feelings for you at all. And she immediately ended shit with you for me once she knew I loved her too. So get any ideas of the past out of your head. None of this truth should bug you if you're over her but I'm just making sure. I hate when my baby's friends have ill intentions and she thinks they are just friends and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all. If I can trust you to not stress me and my baby or fuck with our love tell me. I will leave you alone and apologize. But if you aren't over her and you're tryna ""get some"" or you're tryna get back in her life, it's NOT HAPPENING. She said you were nothing to her, and the sex was bad anyway haha. You're small and weak and she said it all felt wrong after being with me. She's been with me ever since. We're in love. And tomorrow me and her will be together in my room making love alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a man or tell me our love doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple. So??? What is it? You are after my woman then huh?! Tell me the fucking truth man. Don't you dare be disrespectful and gross enough to bring it up, but if if you ask her about anything she shared with me about your weak ass, she may be nice and lie to you, or she may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm her soullmate and her boyfriend of the past two years almost. And she tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my kenna. I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make moves with my woman. And i respect you as a guy in the service. I'm sure you're an ok dude. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my kenna but a brother like friend. I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it. Find a nice classy woman where you are stationed, marry her.... But back off of mine. You will never even compare to me in her eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and kenna's love. It's our lives man. It's really not cool.... Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in the service. Sorry to bring your day down with my crazy bullshit but. Me and kenna are head over heels.... I can't help but be crazy about her. I love her with all of my heart and I will protect her from her untrustworthy fake friends. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your head so I'm questioning a lot right now. Just know I'm never gonna hurt her, I'm always going to have her back, I'd give my life for her without hesitation, and I will protect her from anything, everything, and anyone. She is the love of my life. I fully intend to marry and give kenna my children. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is. I just moved back and me and her miss eachother so badly and we are FINALLY go to see eachother tomorrow and make love for the first time since halloween.... I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good dude. Just protective of the woman who holds my heart. And who's heart I hold and must protect. I hope you can understand. She promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that she's not interested:""/ I wish I knew before I embarrassingly went off on you. I'm so sorry man. I'm sorry. Please don't mention this to my baby:/ I'm really embarrassed and while she will understand, I just feel like an ass for attacking you when you have nothing with my kenna and no intention to. Good bye brother. I hope you find your one true love someday. It'll make you crazy, trust me, but you'll find her one day. I found mine when I was really young. And it's my kenna :)"

In terms of teams, /r/NLTP, /r/MinorLTP, and /r/MLTP are the places to check for normal league play. However, all of their seasons are just about to end. Before the next seasons begin, I'd recommend checking out /r/USContenders. It is a ladder-style league where you can make your own team by picking up free agents (or friends you know) and challenging other teams whenever you like on whatever map you like. You should read the stuff in the sidebar over there for more info.   I recommend USContenders first just because it's a good way to get some competitive experience. Another great way is the nightly Sphere-Origin Champions League tournaments.   For any competitive TagPro you'll want to download Mumble. Info about mumble can be found in the sidebar on /r/TagPro. Once you have mumble and sign in, find the SOCL channel and someone there will be able to explain what the deal is (it's really easy to get involved and really fun).  Hope this helps and feel free to ask questions in this sub. We're all willing to help!"

spheremasterrace,33rm0e,xKillaCuddleSx,5,Sat Apr 25 01:25:03 2015 UTC,The tagpro community is struggling to grow because there hasn't been any new pushes lately.

I don't want people who whine about losing sticking around. It's bad enough having to deal with bad players who think are being screwed over by teammates when they're the ones screwing up the match. It would be different if they looked at the situation and thought of ways to improve, but no, they're automatically awesome and it's everyone else's fault. I'm not going to help those kind of people."

spheremasterrace,33nmwi,johnm21789,2,Fri Apr 24 15:53:23 2015 UTC,I was until today.  Sometimes the goddamn matchmaking algorithm (or complete lack thereof) just kills me.  I had 4 games in a row where I stood alone with brand new players while the other team was stacked with 80-120 degree players.  Someone should have at least made an attempt to fix matchmaking before ever releasing rolling 300.
spheremasterrace,33nmwi,suburban_robot,2,Fri Apr 24 17:38:24 2015 UTC,No way am I adding the extra pressure of trying to win most of my games lol. I'll just enjoy the game in my way.

spheremasterrace,32jmft,mahniggasbetrippin,17,Tue Apr 14 11:59:01 2015 UTC,"If you're gonna call the community out, do it with your regular not a throwaway. Personally, I'm not going to take you seriously because you apparently don't care enough about what you say to stand behind it. Yes trolling is a problem, but on all servers, not just sphere. I hangout on mumble everyday and I'm pretty sure I haven't heard anyone talking about depression. I'm sorry if anyone reading this has depression rn, come chat with us on mumble and we can talk it out. Otherwise, this post really isn't saying anything of substance.  EDIT: Sorry if I came across as hostile, but I had reasons to doubt this post, given the nice people I've seen on this server and your little jab at the community at the end. We've had numerous trolls on this sub and I have zero tolerance towards them. I may or may not know who the real person is, but if you see this, hop on sphere and we can talk right now. I've struggled with depression before and it's always better to have someone to talk to. I think you just happened to catch the channel at a bad time -- we'd more than welcome helping you out.   And to OP, next time make the post with your real account and feel free to call whoever you need to out. This isn't something that would warrant downvotes had it been posted by a regular."

spheremasterrace,32jmft,hydraskull1,4,Tue Apr 14 22:41:23 2015 UTC,"You actually weren't on mumble when this event occurred. There were about ~10 of us in Sphere channel and I won't mention names, but someone expressed concern about their own well-being. At first most (if not all) of us agreed to take part and listen. However before this came up, plans to start a PUG with people in that channel had already been under way.   Unfortunately that said person who came forward in expressing concern was somewhat abandoned (not on purpose and not by everyone). People went off to play the PUG but there were a few who stayed behind to continue the conversation; even go so far as to make a separate channel to continue said conversation.  I will agree, however, that this post shouldn't have been done by a throw-away."
spheremasterrace,32jmft,xKillaCuddleSx,11,Tue Apr 14 16:17:28 2015 UTC,"As another person in the mumble channel, I would like to extend my deepest apologies to the party that tried to connect with us in the channel.  Me, and I'm sure all the other people in that channel, are really sorry that this happened, and are willing to be there for the party that came forth last night.  Keep in mind, however, that this action did not come from a position of malice, bullying, or deliberate ignorance, as this post claims.  This was just an unfortunate situation during a late night pugging session, and I still deeply regret our choice of action that night.  As Carab said, we were pugging for a few dozen minutes before that, when said person reached out to us in mumble chat, which is difficult to reciprocate in the middle of a game.  As this happened, all in the middle of a game which they were speccing, I and others tried to listen and empathize with his situation, suggesting advice.  I agree that I regrettably said, ""Give me 5 minutes.""  I know that's not the thing to say within this context but again, I didn't realize the urgency of the situation.  When the game closed up, I saw him talking in chat with 2 other people in the group (one a specific professional that could help him with certain parts of his situation.)  There was also a separate channel involved.  I stayed online for this same person until about 3AM with 3 others, talking about philosophy and religion and time travel, so I thought he had talked it over with others in the channel.  I definitely should've brought it up, but I didn't.  To the person that reached out to us: I'm sorry I wasn't there for you last night, and I hope I can rectify that.  I'll be online for a long period of time tonight (when I'm not streaming) and I would love to talk about depression or health problems with you.  You are absolutely loved in the community, and we would never do anything to indirectly hurt you.  That's why it hurt me reading this, because I know what happened last night was a terrible situation in the context of your suffering, and I'm sorry.  To the maker of the post: Please try and contact individual parties before you make a scathing post on /r/spheremasterrace.  Our actions, again, were not deliberate, and we would appreciate it if instead of holding rage and disappointment against us, you would bring it to our attention.  This post doesn't help to solve anything by publicly shaming others rather then bringing us into the conversation.  Wrapping it up, a bad situation in Sphere mumble happened.  We are all here for you.  I'm sorry you felt ignored, and your huge role in the community is not taken for granted.  I hope you come back to the channel.  -JBaayBaay"

spheremasterrace,32jmft,ArcticFrankie10,5,Wed Apr 15 00:19:17 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to sum up what I'm getting here.      Person A came to mumble to talk about his issue(depression) and was ignored but not actually bullied there is this correct? If not tell me in a pm who bullied him(I'm already aware of who this is about).     Past that, the other main problem is trolls an bullies in general am I correct that these are the two discussion points?  /u/ArcticFrankie10 , /u/xKillaCuddleSx , /u/TagproKanye     If those are the discussion points, here's my thoughts on it.      In relation to discussion topic one, it sucks that he was ignored, but understanding that this is a game and they had plans I can't really say it's surprising. Did anyone stick around with person A to be sure that they were okay and such(if so good on you, you're what sphere is supposed to embody)? If anyone could reach out to him if they have some more reliable contact method than reddit that would be awesome.      I'm rather ashamed if person A was ignored however. Here I expect everyone who wants to be part of our community to try and talk to each other and be friends. Friendship is not something that is always convenient. Friendship means putting your game on hold and addressing this person's issue. Life is precious and anyone who is depressed has issues seeing value in their own life. We must help them see value in it, and help them hold on to that hope. If you aren't going to be a true friend on here when it matters most, please unsubscribe from this sub.     On the second point, theres not much we can do besides calling each other out, giving a warning, reporting in game, flagging posts on here, and not ignoring bad behavior. Ignoring it can be just as bad as condoning it. Don't ignore it cause it's your friend or someone you know. Report them, if they complain, let them know why in a pm you felt it needed to be done.     Lastly if you have some personal problems you want to discuss, I'm sure that anyone on this sub you consider a friends would be willing to listen and try to help. PM them or create a post and as a community I hope we can all come together to make this a better place.      - samuraiseoul"
spheremasterrace,32jmft,samuraiseoul,3,Tue Apr 14 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"I stayed back and created a new channel to discuss what was going on with Person A. I even messaged Person A to ask if we could talk in private but Person A said that it could be put on hold for that moment. I told Person A that I was available whenever if any discussion between us wanted to take place.  I was so pro-active about it because Person A has taken time out of their life to listen to my issues, that I couldn't stand myself if I didn't help Person A."

It seems to be to not have the people who were acting improperly associating their name with this post.  I agree, the post is helpful.

spheremasterrace,32jmft,Aaron215,3,Tue Apr 14 21:34:49 2015 UTC,"The worst 'bullying' I have ever seen on this server was 'pls' and 'someball 8272(170 move!'  Granted I'm rarely on mumble, but in game, sure there are a few occasions when people may have bad games and say something like 'omg team fucking noob,' but honestly I've never seen any substantial bullying that comes to mind"
spheremasterrace,32jmft,Citrine_Excalibur,3,Tue Apr 14 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"I understand the intent behind calling out people who you've felt did not show enough compassion in the described events last night, and I think you have every right to be disappointed in these people. I think bringing to light events like this allow everyone to re-evaluate how they want to participate in this community and how they want their actions to reflect them in general.That said, people are free to react to situations however they see fit.  In reading Carabdis's and STRFKER account of what happened, I have to conclude that it doesn't sound like there was any malice intent from the event that occurred last night. Not everyone feels morally obligated to stay and listen. I'm glad you do.  I haven't seen bullying on sphere, but stick to PUBing in this community and don't really participate in the sphere ""club"". If you would like to see the specific bullying stop we as a community need clear instances of it occurring, names and all, so that we can publicly condemn poor behavior if we so chose.  TLDR: NAMES OR NO ACTION!~"
spheremasterrace,32jmft,TeaCrusher,2,Tue Apr 14 18:57:16 2015 UTC,"Tea is correct, we are by far the nicest server in tagpro, it's been proven (thanks science).  I srs think we're good for bullying, for the most part if it's happening, the offender is told to stop by others."
spheremasterrace,32jmft,NimblyJimblyNS,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:08:51 2015 UTC,"For real, I'm a scientist and ran some statistical measures of niceness. Turns out we are definitely the nicest. You wouldn't doubt science would you?"
spheremasterrace,32jmft,TeaCrusher,2,Tue Apr 14 23:22:45 2015 UTC,"Like Jbay said, everyone was talking in the channel pugging and what not, the person A said he needed to talk about something. I assumed that it was something...not so serious. It wasn't after the game finished that we (the 7 people pugging and myself) started catching up on what Person A was typing. Then comes what I said. that we all expressed concerned and tried talking to him. It wasn't so much that we did or didn't feel morally obligated to listen because most of us tried and were there to talk. Some offered extensive help by trying to exchange contact info with Person A to further talk about the issue as well as talk outside of mumble.   I APOLOGIZE for not having left the group earlier to try and talk. I just wasn't aware that it was to talk about something THAT serious.  As for the bullying...to avoid using ""foul"" language, all I have to say is that most if not all of the experienced players or people in the subreddit jump in to stop it and themselves don't bully. I really don't know where OP was getting that from.   Again, I apologize."
spheremasterrace,32jmft,ArcticFrankie10,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:39:48 2015 UTC,"Oh you don't have anything to apologize for in my opinion, and especially not to me :) I'm not one for getting personal on mumble, and in an instance like that i probably would have left if i saw that people were taking care of each other. OP seems offended and I'm not really sure why to be honest.  ON another note, people who are suicidal NEED to talk to professionals. Use your tagpro community if you must but talk to a councilor or a therapist. If you are worried enough to talk to us, you're at the point where you need help."
spheremasterrace,32jmft,TeaCrusher,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:10:57 2015 UTC,There is no sphere club lol. Anyone is free to get mumble and hang out in the sphere mumble channel. There is no exclusivity. All you have to do is ask for a group link and you can play with whoever is in the channel.
spheremasterrace,32jmft,Omidio,3,Tue Apr 14 19:37:34 2015 UTC,"Ive never seen this, but it probs happened  Anyway who are you? Probs anne."
spheremasterrace,32jmft,eatfrenchfries,3,Tue Apr 14 19:50:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually peace'd the other night because I was tired of the negative and rude behavior. If there were a chat function to mute players, I would use it, because some people just don't know how to stop talking."
spheremasterrace,32jmft,djmounce553,2,Wed Apr 15 02:06:50 2015 UTC,"Search ""chat enhancer"" by dr. Holmes on the main subreddit, it has a mute feature"
spheremasterrace,32jmft,TagPort,5,Thu Apr 16 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be dead honest. One of the ""bullies"" he refers to here is me. Why? Because I called him out on the truth, and he doesn't like that.  I was also in the channel last night, and the reason I didn't ""care enough"" was because when I asked the same question three times, I was just ignored and he gave me no answer while continuing to talk to the others. He wasn't ignored or anything of the sort. As has been stated we were in the middle of a PUG when this came up. At least 5 of the 8 people who weren't actually afk responded so I don't know how you can say that we weren't ""focusing on the real issue at hand."" A few of us spoke with you for a few mins, but then said that we'd get back to you after the game because it was 5 mins from being finished, and they wanted to give you their full concentration after those 5 mins. Carab even made a new channel for you guys to talk in so I don't know where this is coming from.  On another note, at least use one of your main accounts rather than a throwaway and be completely honest about who you are."
spheremasterrace,32jmft,WhiteBeast4,2,Tue Apr 14 21:29:48 2015 UTC,"While I'm neither a regular around here nor OP, I'll stand behind what he said, specifically with regards to ignorance. I was there last night and saw the situation and admittedly didn't help very much. To the person this post is concerning, I've thought a lot about what you said and if you wanna talk just find me on mumble."

Pros: It sounds decent (I use it on streams), it's only 17 dollars, and it's a lapel mic so you don't have to worry about knocking it over or anything.  It's also by Sony and they're a good brand, and I have abused it a lot when I got it (stepped on it, stood up when still clipped, etc)  Cons: The cord is short-ish.  Also, you have to remember to take it off every time you leave the desk."

And that amount was almost a trace. He also said the place to get your info about these is europe, as they have had them for longer and are generally less biased, (big T, FDA, etc.)"

spheremasterrace,3197y0,goodygood_274,2,Fri Apr 3 04:23:27 2015 UTC,"So lets say you have portal A, and you want to link it to portal B.  You link Portal A to Portal B.  Then afterwards you make Portal C off the map in a useless place.  You link portal B to portal C, and delete portal C (put a black space, or tile, spike whatevs down).  Now Portal B will be an exit portal.  You can repeat this process for having multiple exit portals all be linked to one 'portal C'."
spheremasterrace,3197y0,TheSleepyJesus,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:17:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure, I haven't really done it. I think if you delete part of the json the map editor generates (specifically the destination property), it should create a portal that, since it has no destination, will only be an exit."

Other than that I played a lot of tag with friends, until I fell a few times and broke my wrist.  Sometimes my sister and I would race our bikes to the food bank. That was fun but one time I flipped and got hurt pretty bad.  There was a game my brother and I played where we would see who could hide fastest when my dad started screaming (when he wasn't in prison, that is). My dad would probably laugh about this now if he weren't dead, ha.  Oooh, and years later we got an N64 and I really liked Milo's Astro Lanes."
spheremasterrace,30xm8o,TheSleepyJesus,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:41:14 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Uncharted Waters: New Horizons of article  Uncharted Waters:       This game is perhaps the most famous of the series. Even though an English version exists, it still has not managed to achieve the mainstream popularity Pirates! had. There is only a relatively small following outside East Asia. [citation needed]  Also set in the 16th century, this game is a sequel to the first title and was released for NEC PC-98, SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive and PC in 1994. It also saw releases in 1996 on Sega Saturn and PlayStation in Japan exclusively. The SNES version was released on Nintendo's Virtual Console in Japan on March 17, 2009 and in North America on April 6, 2009 for the Wii  and in Japan on October 30, 2013, in North America on November 14, 2013 and for the first time in Europe on November 28, 2013 for the Wii U.  In this game, there are six protagonists to choose from, each of them representing a different path or career featured in the game:   João Franco: Son of Leon from the first game, a Portuguese explorer sent by his father to follow the family's footsteps and discover the secrets of the lost continent of Atlantis. Catalina Erantzo: Former Spanish naval officer turned pirate, she avenges the loss of her brother and her fianceé and suspects that the Franco family is behind this scheme. She is loosely based upon the historical character of Catalina de Erauso, the Lieutenant Nun. Otto Baynes: English naval officer, a privateer sent by Henry VIII in a secret mission to defeat the Spanish Armada and prevent Spanish hegemony in the European continent. Ernst von Bohr: Dutch teacher and cartographer, he is set to make a journey to far lands and with this experience create a map of the entire world. Pietro Conti: Italian treasure hunter, he inherited a huge debt from his father and is set to travel for treasures and other secrets in order to cover the debt. Ali Vezas: Turkish merchant, he grew up as an orphan in extreme poverty. With the help of his friend, he decides to become a trade merchant and find his lost sister.   While the game is more or less open-ended, developing the character's career is necessary to advance the plot.  At the time of release, the SNES version of the game is noted to contain superior music to the other ports of the game, as the game took advantage of the SNES' Nintendo S-SMP chip and used high quality instrument samples. On the other hand, the other console ports of the game at that time were released on consoles that used an OPL2 family chipset for music. While the PC could support high quality samples via the Sound Blaster AWE32 or Gravis Ultrasound family of cards, the PC port game did not take advantage of those advanced solutions, instead choosing to only be optimized for AdLib music cards, which used an OPL2 chip for music.  The Saturn and PlayStation version contained enhanced FMV opening cutscenes.  Reviewing the Genesis version, GamePro deemed the game an acquired taste due to the bare bones presentation and frequent money-managing, and concluded ""If you have an interest in four masted voyages of European discovery, you could read a history book or play this game - the excitement levels are about the same.""   In 2007, Koei announced the release of Mobile Daikoukai Jidai 2. The game is a port of the original for both iMode and Yahoo Mobile capable mobile phones in Japan.

See cops pull up on one end of the street and then a group of about 30 people sprint out from around the corner on the other end of the street, was like a scooby-doo esque chase scene"

However, in my studying for it, I put off all my homework...probably won't be checking in on this thread that often since I have a lot to do today but I'll still check every now and then and talk with you guys!  I'm glad we started this sphere fitness group.  I went to the gym 4 times this week, and might go today once I am done with my hw.  Been really digging Lucki Eck$ lately, he's a rapper from chicago.  Would recommend checking him out.  Also currently obsessed with Sons of Anarchy.  Anybody watch it? Thoughts?  I'm on season 5 right now."

spheremasterrace,30qawe,Tangent_Sphere,4,Sun Mar 29 20:07:56 2015 UTC,I always hate starting hw but I start enjoying it half way through. I dunno if you're the same.
spheremasterrace,30qawe,psychfan5,3,Sun Mar 29 20:19:48 2015 UTC,"Ha. I know the feeling.  For me, I really struggle with just getting started, but once I am 15-20 minutes in I am able to buckle down and pound it out.  One thing I do to motivate myself is to say to myself, ""Once I finish this chapter and do the online quiz, I will play 5 tagpro games, or watch an episode of Archer/Always Sunny, etc.""  I don't like doing the homework but if I set rewards for getting done I work more quickly and have reason to be happy about finishing."
spheremasterrace,30qawe,oo_snap,2,Sun Mar 29 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"Sort of like what pelota said but I would try doing a punishment/reward thing. You could limit yourself to not playing games until you've completed it, or do something you dislike at the end of every day you don't complete it(cleaning/difficult exercise for example). If you don't do it, you end up doing something productive anyway. If you do, then you get to do something you enjoy instead."

Or is there only a 1 fortune per day limit? Also, say I get a fortune I don't want, is there a way to remove that fortune?   EDIT: So we ordered chinese takeout and the guy threw 10 cookies in there. I couldn't help but eat all 5 >.< after. That's when I wondered if having 5 fortunes invalidated any of them.  I did a little research and the only good rule I found (it's more of a game really) is to add ""in bed"" to the end of each. Here's what I got   ""Although it feels like a roller coaster now, life will calm down in bed.""  ""You will make many changes before settling satisfactorily in bed.""  ""You will learn quickly, never fear in bed.""  ""You will live a long life and eat many fortune cookies in bed.""  ""Your exotic ideas lead you to many exciting, new adventures in bed."""
spheremasterrace,30qawe,noididntjustget,3,Mon Mar 30 00:31:16 2015 UTC,"All of the fortunes count, and if they are mutually exclusive then the last fortune takes precedence. As for removing fortunes, you'll need to submit a formal request at a traditional Daoist temple and then click your heels and spin around 10 times."

spheremasterrace,30c3c8,oo_snap,3,Thu Mar 26 13:59:57 2015 UTC,Franklin BBQ is best in Austin. Really top notch BBQ from a kick ass little trailer. Its on 11th street.
spheremasterrace,30c3c8,B-Comp,2,Thu Mar 26 10:34:22 2015 UTC,"They have sold out their brisket every single day their business has been open. Anyone visiting should definitely check it out. Make sure you get there early though, there can be huge lines."
spheremasterrace,30c3c8,B-Comp,2,Thu Mar 26 10:37:23 2015 UTC,Its also been rated best BBQ in Texas by a couple magazines
spheremasterrace,30c3c8,B-Comp,1 point,Thu Mar 26 10:37:54 2015 UTC,"Are they open Sundays? How early should you get there if I wanted to eat, say, lunch?"
spheremasterrace,30c3c8,Aaron215,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:32:06 2015 UTC,Yes but they are closed on Mondays. I went on the weekend once and the line was much longer than on weekdays. They are only open for lunch and open at 11 AM. Even if I get there at 10:30 I wont get lunch until 12 and that's on a good day. Everytime Ive been there it's been 1 1/2 wait and I usually only go there if it's 10 AM.
spheremasterrace,30c3c8,B-Comp,2,Sat Mar 28 18:18:57 2015 UTC,There  was is this one BBQ buffet type of place in Southlake. I used to go there a lot because it was one of my dad's favorite places to eat.
spheremasterrace,30c3c8,ArcticFrankie10,2,Thu Mar 26 03:44:41 2015 UTC,was? Is it gone now?

spheremasterrace,30c3c8,B-Comp,1 point,Thu Mar 26 10:46:09 2015 UTC,"There's an awesome BBQ place in Houston called Corkscrew BBQ. It started out as a food truck but now it is growing. They sell stuff until they run out, when they sell out for the day that's it they close shop. On Saturday, you end up waiting a good hour or so in line for food. That part kinda sucks, but if you go on a weekday for lunch you are in and out pretty quickly."

spheremasterrace,30aihu,mahniggasbetrippin,2,Thu Mar 26 01:12:48 2015 UTC,Currently have a fractured finger which is kinda holding my deadlifts back due to grip strength for the time being (need to get some straps for my right hand). Did a pyramid scheme up to a set of 375x5 and worked down. Worked the rest of my back and core afterwards. I got a good amount of running in yesterday afternoon during rugby practice. Still working on getting my XC base back though. So far it looks like a friday afternoon activity with the group is a possibility.

I can't do a single push up at all right now, so I'll just start with a few push ups on my knees to start.   I might just bike to yoga, it's only a few miles away anyway."

spheremasterrace,309tm8,The_Gray_Pilgrim,3,Wed Mar 25 22:11:17 2015 UTC,Lol thank you! I'm quite partial to it :) All credit goes to Skwid! I have no idea how to do those things.
spheremasterrace,309tm8,The_Gray_Pilgrim,3,Thu Mar 26 03:11:51 2015 UTC,"Wow that's a long list! Lol. Haven't seen you around in games lately, you been busy with school and such?"
spheremasterrace,309tm8,The_Gray_Pilgrim,2,Wed Mar 25 21:36:19 2015 UTC,"Oh man I love music, the expression of the soul, that raw emotion, can't get enough. I know man, I'm not playing nearly as often as I used to. School got incredibly busy this semester, and TAing is a lot more work than I bargained for lol. I'll sneak in a game or two sometimes after midnight when I've thrown in the towel haha."
spheremasterrace,309tm8,Brucho,2,Wed Mar 25 21:49:45 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, music really speaks to the soul in ways that almost no other art form can. I'll cross my fingers to see you around! You're always a good D partner to have"
spheremasterrace,309tm8,The_Gray_Pilgrim,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:55:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks man! I think we make a pretty good team :) I'll still pop in every once and a while, probably more so on the weekends. The problem is I'll tell myself I'll only play one or two games and look up and somehow it's 2 in the morning lol."
spheremasterrace,309tm8,Brucho,2,Thu Mar 26 03:41:18 2015 UTC,"I have been listening to a lot of Bluegrass lately after taking up playing the mandolin. You should check out Punch Brothers, Nickel Creek, Chatham County Line, and The Giving Tree Band if you haven't already!"
spheremasterrace,309tm8,The_Gray_Pilgrim,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"Ahh the mandolin is an amazing instrument, I'm jealous! I got a concertina for christmas that I've been tinkering around on, but I haven't had as much time for music lately as I'd like. How long have you been playing?  Nickel Creek is great! I haven't heard of those other bands though, I'll have to check them out, thanks!"
spheremasterrace,309tm8,Brucho,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:44:40 2015 UTC,8 months. Same deal for me though as I have not had any time to play in the past 2 months while we moved so I am a bit rusty. A good friend of mine is moving to Denver and he is a music teacher so I get to have a great friend as my teacher for cheap now so that will help get me back into it.
spheremasterrace,309tm8,The_Gray_Pilgrim,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:08:43 2015 UTC,That's awesome man! Having someone to teach you rather than going it alone makes a huge difference. I bet you'll pick it back up pretty quickly. Would you mind moving to Texas and giving me lessons by chance? I can teach you the squeeze box! :D
spheremasterrace,309tm8,Brucho,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:37:13 2015 UTC,Next time I come to Austin I'll give ya a holler. we can meet up and exchange some basics!

spheremasterrace,309tm8,Brucho,3,Wed Mar 25 17:34:58 2015 UTC,Nice! I like The Decemberists and Avett Brothers but haven't heard of the others.
spheremasterrace,309tm8,The_Gray_Pilgrim,3,Wed Mar 25 17:42:50 2015 UTC,They would best be described as Alt-Country. Really good stuff.
spheremasterrace,309tm8,Puggy818,2,Wed Mar 25 18:39:22 2015 UTC,"LOVE the Avett Brothers! I'm hoping to see them this summer in Dallas with Old Crow Medicine Show, you should go!"
spheremasterrace,309tm8,ArcticFrankie10,2,Wed Mar 25 21:18:25 2015 UTC,I am seeing them at Red Rocks this summer with Sturgill Simpson. Totally geeked for that show!   edit: I would be up for it but I live in Denver.

They are a local band that is starting to blow up (performing at Lollapalooza this year) and I feel like they sound kind of similar to Caribou maybe?

spheremasterrace,309tm8,Citrine_Excalibur,2,Wed Mar 25 18:32:55 2015 UTC,pls lol i posted it two minutes after you posted yours we were probably typing at the same time...  i will delegate all daily discussion threads to you from here on out
spheremasterrace,309tm8,samuraiseoul,2,Wed Mar 25 18:35:43 2015 UTC,"no, NO! nah. it's k.   Ok, so I've been listening to this one song called ""Que bello es vivir"" by El Kanka. The song makes me extremely happy every time I listen to it. I've also been going back to some of my favorites like Mardy Bum- Arctic Monkeys (hence my username) and Kahlil Gibran - STRFKR.  OH and Trains by Wampire."
spheremasterrace,309tm8,The_Gray_Pilgrim,2,Wed Mar 25 18:39:22 2015 UTC,"Do you speak spanish?? From my rough knowledge that song is titled ""How beautiful it is to live"" or something along those lines...I'm listening to it right now! Got a very good vibe to it even though I can't understand what he is saying lol"
spheremasterrace,309tm8,samuraiseoul,2,Wed Mar 25 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"I DO! Pelota if we are gonna be teammates we need to get to know each other better.   My favorite line ""I will go out on the street each day with my biggest smile"". I just really like the entire song!   and you got the name right too!   what music do you suggest I try out? Also, we already had a music thread...like two weeks ago....that I STARTED...  but...I'll give you today! :) you are now free of competition"
spheremasterrace,309tm8,PlaylisterBot,2,Wed Mar 25 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"lol sorry.  well like my previous comment said i mostly listen to rap.  if you're interested I would recommend Amadu Diablo by Action Bronson, Long Live ASAP by A$AP Rocky, Good Ass Intro by Chance the Rapper, 6 Man by Drake, 'Till I Collapse by Eminem, and Heavenly Father by Isaiah Rashad.    I know that that is a lot of suggestions, but hip-hop is a very diverse genre with many different styles and I feel like the songs I recommended give a little taste of many different parts of the spectrum.  For indie stuff I like Ten Things by Paul Baribeau (Strawberry is a good song of his too), First Day of My Life by Bright Eyes, and Let's Be Still by The Head and the Heart.  However I've just recently gotten into indie so my knowledge isn't anywhere near hip-hop for this genre.  If you have the time or are interested give some of those songs a listen!"

spheremasterrace,30829s,TheSleepyJesus,2,Thu Mar 26 03:26:46 2015 UTC,Single Player mode.   It would be everyman for himself. There would be 8 different colors. If the game isnt full with 2v2 3v3 it doesnt matter because its litereally every ball for itself
spheremasterrace,30829s,Mrsylvestermcbean,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:44:09 2015 UTC,Lol I dig it. Star shaped center flag map. I just wonder if it would be possible to score solo against >4 opponents. It would really reward skill and punish noobs though

spheremasterrace,307ffl,psychfan5,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:41:08 2015 UTC,I agree by is say people post whatever plays you think are worthy. Everyone should just not upvote videos they dont like
spheremasterrace,307ffl,Mrsylvestermcbean,2,Wed Mar 25 05:00:57 2015 UTC,This would be a great idea for like a vine account or Instagram account where people could send in plays to be posted or like a whole social media esque app that could be made for tagpro! It could be a mobile app that you scroll through. I would spend days on this.

I've been swimming a mile a day in about 45 minutes. Ideally I want to get my freestyle 50m down to 25 seconds and my mile down to 35 minutes. If you see me in game remind me not to eat junk food that sits around in my dorm.    Edit: Also I run and lift on tuesdays/thursdays. I ran my mile in ~7:10 and I'd like to get that down to 6:30 if humanly possible. I have no idea what I am doing with weights but I'd like to be able to do my crunches and core workout easily.

I'll definitely remind you to lay off the junk food, and maybe you can impact that by buying less lol. Junk food is more expensive than good food anyway.   I'm sure you can get your mile down. It took infantry school for me to get there but I was at one point doing 2 miles in >12 mins and Im a piss poor runner. Keep up the hard work and you'll get there"
spheremasterrace,301var,psychfan5,2,Mon Mar 23 21:01:11 2015 UTC,WHAT ARE THESE CHEAP HEALTHY*good tasting* FOODS YOU SPEAK OF!!???!?

I'm the past month I have been really trying to increase my activities by adding in more workouts, but I cannot stand running. I can lift weights all day but running just feels like my ankles are going to collapse. Is there anything I can do to help increase my ability to run. Right now I can run a mile in 7:45, but it's just one mile and then I'm in too much pain to run."
spheremasterrace,301var,LurkingLurkersLurk,2,Tue Mar 24 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"That's a respectable mile! I'm not an expert, but if running causes your ankles pain or you think you will be injured maybe you should try other exercises. I'd try swimming or cycling. Even walking is awesome exercise if you get a ruck sack and wear weight. You could also try a stair master at your local gym"

I need to start running, I'm doing the warrior dash April 11th and need to get in running shape for that. It's only a 5k, so it's not that much but still need to start running and hopefully I'll keep going, someone motivate me."
spheremasterrace,301var,mahniggasbetrippin,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:49:32 2015 UTC,Thanks! Are those types of races fun? I've never done one.   What's your current running shape? What are you currently doing to get where you are?
spheremasterrace,301var,OG_Diddles,2,Mon Mar 23 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"Those types of races are great, Ill upload a pic from one I did last year, and one after this race in a few weeks  Current running shape? Out of it. I havn't run in a while, back when I was playing lacrosse every day I could easily run a 5k in about 25 min. Now if i were to go do it, it would probably be 30+min.  Currently doing to help? Pretty much nothing. I told myself I would start right after spring break, which just ended."

I've met great big muscular guys who could bench 400 lbs but couldn't run farther than 1-200 m.

Current goal is to increase my deadlift PB from 435 to 495 lbs by the end of the semester along with getting my squat from 295 to at least 335. Will also be working on my 3 rep max bench. The plan is to continue weight training, eating a crap ton, and continue to improve in the running area.   Liking this whole sphere fitness thing :)"

spheremasterrace,2zw1js,oo_snap,1 point,Sun Mar 22 09:29:47 2015 UTC,I agree. Thats why I posted a couple of replay clips a couple of days ago. Just so the sub can be more active.   I want to post unrelated tagpro stuff too just so it can be more active and we can communicate more.   I'm always checking back to the sub to see what my friends have posted but it hardly changes.

spheremasterrace,2zvuza,TheSleepyJesus,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:30:51 2015 UTC,Oh just browsing reddit. I finished a mid-term paper a little while ago and then played skyrim while my wife and baby watched orphan black. You?
spheremasterrace,2zvuza,TheSleepyJesus,2,Mon Mar 23 05:08:12 2015 UTC,"awesome. midterm for what class?  you wouldnt believe it but im playing TAGPRO!  ...well I was I got kicked for afk because I didn't realize the new game had loaded/started while I was writing this.  I'm also watching ""the jynx"" on hbo its crazy. Have you heard of it?  and what do you think of destiny? I just got the expansion pack on ps3."

It's really good, you should watch it.   I dont really play any games except for tagpro. I got the destiny expansion because I keep playing tagpro instead. Destiny is the first game I've bought in a long time.  Destiny and Battlefield 4."

spheremasterrace,2zvuza,Calvin-ball,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:27:33 2015 UTC,I know a lot of people have complaints but I actually think its great. Really fun and cool. Got boring kinda quick though.   Finally played the new expansion today though so that made it enjoyable again.   You?
spheremasterrace,2zvuza,TheSleepyJesus,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:39:29 2015 UTC,I'm debating buying it or not. My friend says I would find it to be very fun but I've heard lots of negative things about it.  I absolutely love skyrim though so if they're similar maybe I should check it out.
spheremasterrace,2zvuza,Calvin-ball,1 point,Tue Mar 24 07:10:01 2015 UTC,What system?   I think its a really good game and really fun to play. I think theres a lot of really cool things about it. The only thing that kinda sucked was that it got kinda repetitive but the new expansion is here so thats not so.

You activate the left bomb and touch the one that spawns and cancel out most of your momentum to the right. Since your opponents were blasted past the right bomb because you set off the left one, they were sent even faster to the right once you detonated the bomb that spawned on the right.

I'm probably about to type way more than I need to (I type so much)  After I switched to burrito people kept mistaking me as this old player that was apparently really popular named swingman/burrito  I didn't want to take someones name, especially someone known, so I started changing my name all around trying to find something I liked.   Wanted to be a Dog like all of you guys so I played as that for a while.   buuUuUUuUuuuuut burrito just felt right and everyone on sphere knew me as that so I just went back."

The best thing you can do is when you see someone acting like this is to quit after the next game and go on to IRC. SOMONE GIVE HIM THE LINK IM ON MOBILE you want to join the channel called #TPMods. From here you can type in chat ""!mods [reason why you need help]"" they will check into it. Unfortunately hornysister is a little bitch, but if you say that in chat you can get banned by our mods :(. Next time just try quitting for about a game to report them on IRC. Then just wait for them to make a mistake in game and watch the mod ban them!"

I've been messing around with it for the past few days since before it had looked like the default.   Other than travelling I'll be available pretty much every day.

spheremasterrace,2xdi9c,B-Comp,4,Fri Feb 27 18:35:24 2015 UTC,BRO I used to drink Mate everyday! I still have my bombilla!
spheremasterrace,2xdi9c,B-Comp,4,Fri Feb 27 18:36:06 2015 UTC,Whats your brand of choice out there? Is Rosamonte popular out there?
spheremasterrace,2xdi9c,B-Comp,3,Fri Feb 27 18:36:56 2015 UTC,"Is Rosamonte popular out there?   It is... I personally don't like it. Too much dust. Union would be my favorite. I remember once in school when we didn't have enough money to buy it we bought a bag called ""Mulita"". I didn't have high hopes for it because it seemed like a 3rd tier brand, but it was amazingly good. Later my dad told me that's the brand they usually drink in the field because it's cheap. Sadly I can't seem to find it in the city I moved to  Edit: They even sponsor a car in the national touring series"
spheremasterrace,2xdi9c,B-Comp,3,Fri Feb 27 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"I have tried Union and remember it being pretty good. I buy the Rosamonte especial or w/e, it is noticeably better than the original Rosa. Amanda is powdery but man is it strong. Besides that Ive tried Cruz de Malta which may be my fav in terms of taste. Then I bought 10lbs of that Taragui stuff and never really got sick of it....Man I love mate <3 I love introducing my friends to the ritual as well...most of 'em seem to dig it, even the whole sharing the bombilla aspect."
spheremasterrace,2xdi9c,B-Comp,3,Fri Feb 27 18:51:04 2015 UTC,That's awesome man! Just remind them that the mate is not a microphone. Tell them not to slow it down ;)
spheremasterrace,2xdi9c,B-Comp,3,Fri Feb 27 18:52:43 2015 UTC,I make them turn the bombilla towards the next person they are sharing with. Gotta follow the rules

spheremasterrace,2xbkpx,Mrsylvestermcbean,2,Fri Feb 27 14:36:01 2015 UTC,You paid that for that!?
spheremasterrace,2xbkpx,ArgieGrit01,3,Fri Feb 27 15:55:14 2015 UTC,"Argie I'm not going to lie, this is impossible to explain unless you try it yourself. So take a trip to Georgia or Texas and I will buy you Taco Bell. Then you will understand."
spheremasterrace,2xbkpx,samuraiseoul,2,Fri Feb 27 16:18:59 2015 UTC,Hey... your post got glided.... so did mine... What the hell?

On my laptop I get horrible ping, like 700-900, unplayable, but it's always been 6 when I'm on the computers in the computer lab. When I came back from break it was up to a constant 20, still super awesome. In the past week or so I've been just glitchin' around the map just having to guess where my ball is haha"

spheremasterrace,2xarlz,rburp,4,Fri Feb 27 03:57:21 2015 UTC,"Okok, so yall texas folk have got to go to Madisonville and get Taco Bell sometime. The madisonville seriously is the bast Taco Bell I have ever had like, they practice witchcraft there or something because it is amazing."
spheremasterrace,2xarlz,burnsc,3,Fri Feb 27 04:45:23 2015 UTC,Will keep in mind. Though I'm an Arkansas folk.
spheremasterrace,2xarlz,hydraskull1,2,Fri Feb 27 04:54:28 2015 UTC,"We have a Taco Bell like that in Hot Springs. We have three. If you go to either of two of them, you'll wait 15 minutes in line, get cold food, the rice-to-other-ingredients ratio in the cheesy bean and rice burritos will be skewed, it's just awful.   But if you go to the one on Central Ave they give you the best fuckin' faux Mexican food this side of the Mississippi. Nice warm nacho cheese, perfect cheesy bean and rice burritos, just the right amount of the jalapeno sauce on your quesadillas...  I'm getting really hungry."

spheremasterrace,2xarlz,psychfan5,3,Fri Feb 27 15:41:09 2015 UTC,"I am! You see, Flying burrito and Taco Bell aren't even in the same food category! T-Bell is fake, cheap, american mexican that I can get anywhere, and is my first love. Flying B is a love I discovered after coming here. It's a substantial more authentic texmex that leaves you feeling like you've met god. They are so mutually exclusive that going to one or the other is no betrayal! It's like saying that because I went to Tokyo Sushi I betrayed my duty to go to Feltner's. They're entirely different food groups."
spheremasterrace,2xarlz,johnm21789,3,Fri Feb 27 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"I expect an ""I'm about to eat Flying Burrito! AMA"" from you sometime soon.   BTW Feltners is fuckin awesome!"

I actually had a teacher who said he liked correcting my tests lol Yeah.... paleontologists don't make much :/"
spheremasterrace,2x8f6y,psychfan5,2,Thu Feb 26 15:08:45 2015 UTC,"Noice Argie, I had no idea we were both seniors. Can you graduate now or will they make you wait till June?"
spheremasterrace,2x8f6y,psychfan5,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:13:32 2015 UTC,"Well... it's complicated.  Those two tests were thermodinamics I and Thermodynamics II. I should have passed Thermo I in 2012 and Thermo II in 2013 but due to me being basically a dumb, lazy fuck I didn't pass them when I had to and I ended up with two failed subjects by the end of 2014 (When I had the graduation party and stuff).  The thing is that this year I started with the uni and had to pass both tests by April or they wouldn't let me sign in (I'm currently doing an introductory course. Not the career itself. That starts in March).  That means I should have graduated last December but because I'm an idiot I didn't. Now you can call me Technician Argie"

Marble Spin- This script will put a slightly transparent 'marble' texture over your ball and rotate that.  Pokerchip spin- This script will have the outside of a pokerchip showing your spin.

spheremasterrace,2w9v9p,oo_snap,2,Wed Feb 18 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"Wage Slaves (metal) by All Shall Perish is pretty angry, but at a system of corruption rather than an individual person. You could always go with Rage Against the Machine, with something like Killing in the Name (metal), or Sleep Now in the Fire (metal); but you really can't get more straightforward than Chimaira's Pure Hatred (metal). Now You've Got Something To Die For (metal) by Lamb of God is pretty good, one of my personal favorites is Eulogy of Genocide (metal) by a local band to Dallas that broke up in 2008 called No Souls Lost. I'd start with Chimaira if you're looking for that blind hatred of anything and nothing in particular. For a punk spin there's Fear's I Don't Care About You, Leftover Crack's Nazi White Trash (punk), Dead Kennedys' Nazi Punks Fuck Off (punk), and I Don't Wanna Hear It (punk) by Minor Threat.  No It Isn't (alternative/pop punk) by +44 is a pretty good one about betrayal; Mark and Travis came out with that album right after Tom left the band. 16 Gallons by The Hooten Hallers is a dirty, bluesy, folkish band; that song is pretty great. The Lumineers' Morning Song (folk) is a pretty somber song about betrayal, but it's really good too.   For triumph, there's Ben Harper's I'll Rise (folk/blues), The Mountain Goats This Year (folk) or Hast Thou Considered The Tetrapod (folk), Black Flag's Rise Above (punk), and Silly Wizard's Ramblin' Rover (celtic folk) (not sure if this counts, but it's one of my favorites and I felt like it should be included).  I've got a bunch of others that are triumphant in their own way, but I'm not sure if they'd be what you're looking for. Let me know if you'd like more of any of them, I love sharing music :)"

They make luxuriously lavish audio beats, and other artists ( mostly rappers) usually use their music to put their vocals over. The CD slow burning lights uses this female's vocalist over their beats and it is one of my favorites, but all their music imho is genius. Please listen but listen to them without vocalist to get a feel for their pure form.     Let me know opinions pls so we can argue about how deaf you are.    I realized I didn't answer your question.

spheremasterrace,2vmu4w,ArgieGrit01,2,Thu Feb 12 16:30:28 2015 UTC,What's your cheese dip?
spheremasterrace,2vmu4w,psychfan5,2,Thu Feb 12 16:48:09 2015 UTC,"Well you see, for years I have tried to create this white cheese dip that all the good Mexican restaurants around here serve. It's kind of a cheese sauce. I looked and looked for years trying to figure out what kind of cheese they use. I always figured it would be some exotic foreign cheese I'd have to hunt down. One day a few months ago I finally figured it out.   It's just white American cheese...  I don't have the recipe here with me at work, but the general idea is to get a double boiler, and put it on medium heat. Then you cube up the cheese (9 ounces) into even chunks that are roughly 1 inch by 1 inch or a bit smaller. Then you put it in the double boiler with a tablespoon or two of butter, and heat it up. After it's mostly liquid, you slowly stir in a dash or two of cumin, a dash of onion powder, a couple of tablespoons of green chiles, one pickled jalapeno, diced as finely as you can, and some of the juice from the pickled jalapenos and the chiles. You also have to add either milk, half and half, or water as you heat it up. I'm still trying to determine the correct proportions of those to add, but the last time I made it it was so damn close to the restaurant's cheese dip that I felt very accomplished.   Now my only problem is that the dip needs to be kept warm to be dippable. If you take it off the heat after a few minutes it develops a skin on top which hinders dipping. That's my last barrier to making the perfect cheese dip. I looked online and there's something called a roux which people use for sauces, and I think figuring out how to make that might be key.   tldr; almost have the perfect Mexican restaurant cheese dip recipe, just needs a little refining, but it's almost perfect when you eat it while it's fresh off the stove."

We wouldn't win at first, but eventually we would get a coach who used to be a tagproer (probably Emilio Estevez). After an unfortunate DWI, this ex-ball would be forced by the courts to coach us. Through a variety of comic misadventures and heartwarming moments, my team would begin to win and eventually become the Champions of sphere. Also, the coach would become a farther figure to me.   After a couple of years we would start playing against international teams and eventually beat some snarky Icelandic tagproers with the help of a funny innercity youth from Los Angeles (think a young Kenan Thompson)    Then, after a few years when no one cared about us anymore,  we would join a boarding school known especially for tagpro.

spheremasterrace,2u8n9o,Alex_Win,3,Fri Jan 30 22:19:10 2015 UTC,Top pointer - don't try to get into the tagpro sign.  Ride on top of the bomb explosions to get to the mario flair.  It's pretty impossible to get into the tagpro
spheremasterrace,2u8n9o,realsquareball,2,Fri Jan 30 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"Once you're there, you have to jump and hold up from the top of the pillar on the right.  You need to time it so that you are either on top of or past the nearest bomb explosion.  Then you ride the wave.  Be patient though because if you slow down while you're bombing across you have more time and higher success rate.  When you're ready, dive into the flair with down."

spheremasterrace,2u5zcz,oo_snap,2,Fri Jan 30 06:28:43 2015 UTC,you go to the left from there and there should be a bomb next to the far left wall. Use it to go up and back to the right one story up. This will get you the hat flair.

Try running TagPro with an ethernet cable instead of over WiFi to see if that makes a different.  If it does, then great, you found the problem.  If not, then try making sure your drivers (especially graphics drivers) are up to date. Sometimes my frame rate drops over WiFi on my Lenovo y50 (which is also a gaming laptop that can run Battlefield 4 on ultra at 40fps)."

Our IT guy at the office told me to use firefox and it works waaaay better. I tried all the different options in the FPS thread etc like you did and none of them solved the issue.

spheremasterrace,2u591a,B-Comp,1 point,Fri Jan 30 18:32:00 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to get pretty bad FPS issues as well. After Chrome started shitting on me like 6 months back I started using IE and would consistently get 60FPS. Then that stopped all together with the new TagPro update. Half the time I try on IE I get a black screen, the other times it's down to 45 FPS or less. Today I tried IE and it was the lowest Ive ever seen it at 15 FPS. After that it then went to the black screen again. No idea what's going on there. On Chrome it's the not very pretty. 35-45 FPS or less with everything turned off, no scripts. Firefox seems to get 40 FPS consistently, sometimes 50. I've tried what muted posted, even have that Process Lasso thing he posted a while back but that hasn't helped. Anyone have any ideas? I'm out of 'em."

spheremasterrace,2tpaxy,Mrsylvestermcbean,3,Mon Jan 26 08:08:39 2015 UTC,"Guys why is this being voted on? Attention feeds it. Anne, I support you in doing what you gotta do, and I appreciate you working on keeping the place clean, but I don't know if I'm behind this sort of thing.  It just seems to me that this stuff is personal to you. This guy(s?) clearly going after you in particular, and he's wrong for doing that and ought to just chill. But I don't know if using your position as a mod to air out the situation to everybody is really appropriate.   This might be handled a bit more privately to keep the drama to a minimum and to discourage the attention-seeking this troll is after. Again, I appreciate your work here and I respect you, I'm just concerned that this silliness is only going to contribute to drama and lead to a bunch of negative vibes on the sub.

Esp since you've got TP mods involved too, I would just keeping quietly squashing anything this guy does that stands out as against the rules.

spheremasterrace,2tpaxy,psychfan5,1 point,Mon Jan 26 23:41:22 2015 UTC,"Good point, but he is currently banned from this sub as well as in game. So he can neither troll on either or read anything on this sub anymore"
spheremasterrace,2tpaxy,Mrsylvestermcbean,1 point,Mon Jan 26 08:19:53 2015 UTC,"Well at least that's good. Why post this stuff though in that case? Although I guess you might have posted this stuff before he was banned so that you had evidence to support his ban to the TP mods. In any case, no worries. I just hate to see you get bogged down in a pissing contest with a troll instead of having fun playing the game."
spheremasterrace,2tpaxy,psychfan5,1 point,Tue Jan 27 07:22:48 2015 UTC,"Basically when I saw that there was a post up it had like 11 upvotes and I assumed some of you guys saw the post. I have been known to be salty in the past and I thought just removing it would make everyone think ""Anne's so salty he will just remove all the posts that call him salty because hes a mod"". This was not what I wanted. So i removed all the troll comments from the post and left up, only my rebuttle. Also if they tried to appeal it to the tagpro mods, the mods will have access to their group chat as well as mumble chat."

If you hiked the south kaibab trail or hermits rest,  chances are you've walked over some of my stonework (trail features / retaining walls). Or if you were on the Rim and walked the new rim trail near s. kaibab trail head (I believe it's called the Green Trail or something dumb like that) we built that a few summers back. I miss it, next time I go out I'm taking a camera. You never quite grasp the Canyon. Just an amazing place. Even more amazing 30 miles in or when you're scared for your life because it's monsoon season and you have no cover in the backcountry and every thunder bolt echoes 10 times over and yeah...lol. I need me some Canyon fixins it's been 3 years!!!"
spheremasterrace,2t4fzw,psychfan5,2,Wed Jan 21 03:05:38 2015 UTC,"""We built that""  Can you give some more context? sounds like an interesting story"
spheremasterrace,2t4fzw,B-Comp,2,Wed Jan 21 04:21:04 2015 UTC,"Our crew was subcontracted by the park service to build the new rim trail. We flagged out the trail (pretty straightforward - follow the rim and make some changes to the pre-existing ""illegal"" footpaths) then went to work for a few months. Had to make it ADA accessible, meaning it had to have like a less than 5% grade and have no big bumps so people in wheelchairs could go on it, which means a lot of dirt was hauled in and tampered to make the foundation as flat as possible. basically lots of this:"
spheremasterrace,2t4fzw,psychfan5,2,Wed Jan 21 12:16:43 2015 UTC,"We did not hike the south kaibab :( We hiked the Havasuku (I butchered this spelling) Trail to the Indian reservation. was approximately a 10-12 hour hike. Spent the night, and then spent the next day doing day hikes to different waterfalls near the reservation. Jumping off a 15 foot cliff into the water next to a waterfall is one of the best feelings in the world. Then we hiked out the next day. The next couple days we did some day hikes at Bryce and that was pretty fun. I would love to go back out there, but probably want to go to other national parks first. I've only been to G.C, Bryce (I think thats a national park), Yellow Stone, the Tetons, and Big Bend. Next stop Yosemite and hopefully Mt. Rushmore and the Black Hills."
spheremasterrace,2t4fzw,B-Comp,2,Wed Jan 21 05:06:55 2015 UTC,Awesome! Love that area! The Supai rez is a gorgeous place. Havasu Falls & Mooney Falls are some of the best spots in the Canyon. And yeah jumping into that blue-green water next to the falls is always the way to go. Probably my favorite part. Bryce is a national park. Feels like Mars but it's a NP. I used to work nearby in Zion Canyon and Dixie National Forest.

spheremasterrace,2t4fzw,ArgieGrit01,3,Wed Jan 21 23:28:08 2015 UTC,Youd need at least a b-2 visa. The organization is called America Conservation Experience.

spheremasterrace,2t4fzw,B-Comp,2,Thu Jan 22 01:36:38 2015 UTC,Well I do have the visa for a few more years. Maybe someday
spheremasterrace,2t4fzw,ArgieGrit01,2,Thu Jan 22 02:58:25 2015 UTC,"Aww man I want to go there  By the way, am I missing something or you walked 10-12 hours straight? O.o I'm guessing you stopped to camp, but i don't know  And on the 15 foot jump, I did that two days ago in Mexico in Xel Ha. The guard told me to land like a stick, standing up, but half way through I got scared and landed with my butt. It didn't hurt until that night lol. When I saw the recording I cringed a bit"
spheremasterrace,2t4fzw,B-Comp,3,Wed Jan 21 23:26:21 2015 UTC,"Havasu falls is more like a 5 hour trek for normal hikers. I think he was saying 10-12 hours total. Cliff jumping is also not as fun as people make it out to be. I had a buddy cliff jump from 20 ft out (something he had done many, many times) and he ended up with a collapsed lung. Kind of scary how that works."

Powered by Atmel ATMEGA8u2 (similar to the arduino leo/micro).  I'm rather new to the community (been playing for a while now, but new to reddit/IRC/idk...), and don't know if anyone has done something similar. Figured I'll post on a smaller subreddit first.

That way we could continue shufflling through content yet still retain the classic maps in the rotation."

spheremasterrace,2rw0oy,Mrsylvestermcbean,4,Fri Jan 9 19:51:25 2015 UTC,"Ever since we've gotten the update I've gotten some weird lag. My ping is lower than it usually is around 30's or 40's but my lag is worse than ever.   My game plays jittery, I move in an odd way. A couple of games ago I tried to sit on the button on Iron but spiked myself twice because my ball moved from where it currently showed.   I disabled the particles, viewport scaler, and Webgl rendering to no avail.  I hope it gets fixed because I'm obsessed with Tagpro and it's really not fun like this at all."

I just wish you could also get rid of that cheesy firework when you die, but Anhk said he'll look into that, and if you have any other problem, you'll just have to get used to it. Just like everyone does with new maps they dislike, so I have no reasons to complain.... FUCK!  Edit: Apparently is worse than that and a lot of stuff doesn't work. Just wait for the patch and it should be fine. In devs we trust"

spheremasterrace,2reu17,ArgieGrit01,3,Mon Jan 5 16:29:29 2015 UTC,"Wow how close do you live to that area? I love how close my town is to lots of trails, and not too far from ""wilderness"", but it looks like you've got the real thing right at your backdoor!"
spheremasterrace,2reu17,Brucho,3,Mon Jan 5 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"We are about an hour to Berthoud from our door in Arvada, CO if there is no traffic. Berthoud is on the way to Winter Park if you drive there from Denver. It's not quite as close to the mountains if you lived in a place like Salt Lake, but living on the west side of Denver keeps us pretty close to some good backcountry skiing and Winter Park which is great because you can avoid a lot of traffic."
spheremasterrace,2reu17,xKillaCuddleSx,3,Mon Jan 5 16:35:15 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Traffic can be a bear getting to the mountains from the springs because of the bottlenecks in Manitou and Denver. Have you ever been out to Glenwood?
spheremasterrace,2reu17,ArgieGrit01,3,Mon Jan 5 16:38:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to Glenwood in ages. Mostly because it's way out past Vail and you're right, the traffic is absolutely awful. It's the main reason we don't do much on piste skiing aside from at Winter Park and Mary Jane.  We did a really fun hike down in the Springs this summer out near Manitou. I can't exactly remember the name of the trailhead but it's was a beautiful hike and CO Springs is just amazing. A close friend of mine works in the public defender's office down there so we come your way every once in awhile."

spheremasterrace,2reu17,mythology_guy,4,Mon Jan 5 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"Why spend so long just hanging out in a car?    I was meeting a cousin in Orange County for Thanksgiving.  So I looked for interesting things to do on the way there,  and on the way back.  I figured it would be a while before I was that far West again,  so took the time to drive up the PCH and into Canada.  Did try to stop at some cool stuff,  like Mt St Helens (which was fogged in).  Besides,  I like cars.     I hope you stopped and visited those locations rather than just drove there and on to the next.   Well,  it was mostly a ""look at stuff while driving"" trip.  Hence the winding.  Joshua Tree,  the Pacific Coast Highway,  etc.   Also why did you leave Mexico and then go back?   My insurance only covered me a certain distance from the border.  And the second trip in was unplanned.  As I got close to California I was getting closer to Mexico again,  so thought,  ""What the hell?""  and jumped back in.  Promptly got lost and had to stop and buy a map.  lulz   Seems like an awfully windy trip   Windy trips are best trips!  I was visiting a cousin in New York for another Thanksgiving,  so took the opportunity to drive half of Route 66 (from the Texas Pandhandle to lower Illinois).  Pic from that trip.  Then on the way back drove out of my way to hit The Tail of the Dragon.  Good trip.  EDIT:   How long did the trip take?   IIRC,  16 days.  That included stopped in Orange County for a few days for Thanksgiving,  and spending another day with my cousin at his place up in San Francisco.  After spending a night in Canada my car started having trouble.  I lost a day in Spokane with car repairs,  so had only 2.5 days to do get home from Spokane to Houston.  Left Friday afternoon,  got home Sunday afternoon.  2200 miles.  That  last leg was a lot of driving even for me."

So I'd been travelling with my best friend in the U.S. for about a week. (Taking a huge trip after high school had been a dream of ours for the longest time.) Anyways... I'd never driven on the 'wrong' side of the road before and once we had made it up San Francisco it was my turn to take the wheel.  Getting out of the city wasn't bad, it was awkward, but manageable. To be honest the highway itself wasn't bad either. However we had heard of a remote section of black sand beaches that Nick and I really wanted to check out. (I tried searching for it on google maps but to no avail.) To get to the coast we had to take a back road and go over a small mountain.  I was the most terrified than I'd ever been in my life doing the hairpin turns zig-zagging up and down the mountain! The beach was amazing and made the nearly 45-minute white-knuckled trip totally worth it.  I'll try to dig up some of my old scenic pictures from around there"

spheremasterrace,2ra6tf,TagProKoala,5,Sun Jan 4 07:09:00 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  As much fun as 20v20 ricochet sounds, it doesn't really answer any questions about the servers.  However, while a 4v4 match of the best shows how the skill of the top players match up, it doesn't really say much about the server as a whole, and excludes a lot of depth players within the server.    So here's my solution: we should break it up into a whole lot of 4v4's, and have each give a certain amount of points to the respective server.  We pretty much know where we stand within the server, so we'd divide it up into 1st 2nd 3rd etc teams like in tennis.  We can also make 1st team wins worth more than 2nd team wins, and the same down the line.  Teams would be decided at game time.  That's only if we're super serious about this and it might be a bit harder to put together, but I personally would be psyched if I could play for sphere in an actual, legit tagpro match."

Mumble is required but a mic is not (but it is recommended). Sign ups for the first season start at 6:30 CST and the draft starts around 7. Then you play in a pre-determined bracket. When the first season is in the finals, sign ups for the second season starts. Then the draft. Then playing. Maps are randomly selected between a pre determined option of like 15 or so. It's a great way to start practicing callouts and playing with a competative team for NTLP and stuff! any more questions and ill be happy to answer them."

I'm telling jokes (but my wife doesn't like my jokes :[ ) I hope to finally earn my bachelor's degree, I've got a big promotion lined up at work so I hope that goes through, my boy will be born soon, and I might look into getting back into the army. So lots!   This is a great thread thanks for putting this up Nim"

We wanted all of our name to go along with a theme so we decided on Marvel,  but of course all the names had to have Tagpro puns in them as well. One of my friends (who still pubs with us sometimes, now known as Ball Punyon) named himself Cappin Merica, my other friend (now known as Razgriz) named himself Spoodertan, and the final friend (who doesn't play anymore) was Ballverine. Our team name was the Superspheroes and we only played a few games before disbanding. I decided to keep the name because I really liked the pun and Thor is my favorite superhero."

spheremasterrace,2qtdg9,sam202tagpro,3,Wed Dec 31 00:19:33 2014 UTC,Originally I played as Sleepy Jesus because Jesus looks like hes taking a nap up there on the cross.   Then I started smurfing as burrito because of tacotacotaco and eventually changed my name to it.   But I found there's a popular Tagpro player that uses the name burrito. So I changed my name to Snacks because of Snacks the Cat. https://twitter.com/snacksthecat  Its the girls from bestcoasts' cats name.

For public games and tourneys and stuff I don't care and you don't have to listen to me anyway.The exception is if we play on the same team, in which case we should make it as confusing as possible.

It was a bengal tiger name tiger woods. I had to make an username for the account so i wanted to be original and say tiger101 but it was taken so i went to brainstorming and decided 202 because it is twice 101. I used that name for that but then I liked the number so much I used it for every account I made since (in some cases it was taken so i had to add something to the end but generally not). At some point i liked the sound of sam202 so much i wrote it as my name for school for ALL OF 5th and 6th grade. Sam202 has sticked since.

It's a reference to Ambrose Bierce, an American writer from the 1800's who I had to write a paper about in High School. He's actually a badass though, he wrote in a very dark / satirical style. Then when he was in his 70s he apparently travelled to Mexico during the Mexican Revolution and disappeared. His death has always been a big unsolved mystery."

On handbrake just select the webm as source and choose a destination.  Click on high profile on the left bar.  and then convert.  On go pro you just import the mp4 file, run it through conversion tab (step 1), and trim the edges off so it imports to gfycat.  Then, on gfycat, you have to click do not resize and upload the new go pro vid.  If you lose resolution on any of these steps tell me and I'll help you out."

spheremasterrace,2q70b8,psychfan5,3,Tue Dec 23 18:10:04 2014 UTC,Fats im in NOLA  tell me where to eat and stuff
spheremasterrace,2q70b8,sam202tagpro,3,Tue Dec 23 19:31:56 2014 UTC,"Oh snap!    IDK what you're looking for but here's some suggestions:  For poboys: Parasols is my favorite, but it's probably out of the way from where you are.  Parkway is delicious and is widely considered the best (it may be out of the way as well).  That said, I've never had a poboy I didn't love.  If you leave New Orleans without eating a poboy, shame on you!  For cajun/creole food:  The Praline Connection (on Frenchmen St.), Coops (in the French Quarter), and Joey K's (on Magazine St. in Uptown) are excellent.  Make sure to eat some red beans and rice while you're here, and if you get a chance try some boudin (cajun pork and rice sausage) and adouille of course.   If you want to drop $50+ on dinner, go to Commander's Palace, Peche (best seafood), or Antoine's (for overpriced, but absolutely classic NOLA food.  It's the oldest restaurant in the city).  If you're looking for BBQ go the The Joint in the Bywater.  No other Q comes close.  For brunch go to Elizabeth's, Surrey's, or The Ruby Slipper.  For beignets and cafe au lait go to Morning Call in City Park (my fav) or Cafe Du Monde in the Quarter (much more famous).    For music, Frenchmen St. is always your best bet but I'm not sure if you'll have any luck getting into anywhere being under 21.  If you're with your parents or adults you can probs get in just about anywhere.  Check out the Spotted Cat if you go to Frenchmen.  Other good clubs there are d.b.a., Blue Nile, and just about everywhere else.  The WWII Museum is pretty badass, as is the sculpture garden in City Park.  There's some Christmas lights show going on at the Botanical Gardens in City Park that my roommates went to and said is pretty cool.  Celebration in the Oaks or something like that.  Pretty much all the cemeteries in town are worth seeing if that kind of thing interests you.  I assume you're staying downtown/in the French Quarter.  If you end up going Uptown or to City Park, taking the streetcar is probably your best way to get around.    If architecture interests you of course check out the French Quarter, but the Garden District in Uptown has some really epic houses (John Goodman and Sandra Bullock have some awesome houses around 3rd St. and Camp St.).  There's a nice cemetery there (Lafayette Cem. #1), and lots of good food/shopping on Magazine St. between Washington St. and Lousiana Ave (you're right near Commander's Palace, Joey K's, Surrey's, Parasols and lots of other restaurants there)."

If you are in spec, and try to join a game, it will put you into speccing that game. So I would have to be in waiting in the group to pub for one game. After that game, I was planning on coming back (I assumed there would be about a minute or so left depending on how my pub went). Then I would want to be in spec to watch the final minutes of the game. This would be impossible with self assign off.  But I would be in waiting.

I don't remember what you said, but it was generally troll-y, though on the weaker side. You were also using a level 3 smurf account. We had no idea who you were, and weren't willing to tolerate random troll-y comments, so we gave you a choice, to either reveal yourself, or to get kicked. This happened in a group, controlled by players with an anti-smurfing policy. I apologize if you got hurt by that. Log in next time."
spheremasterrace,2ptj1l,psychfan5,8,Fri Dec 19 20:57:50 2014 UTC,"I'm not some sort of dick. I didn't single you out for no reason   I know that, you would've done this to anyone, which makes it worse. Sphere is SUPPOSED to be the nice server.   I don't remember what you said, but it was generally troll-y, though on the weaker side.   When you were picking teams you said something along the lines of ""Reveal yourself or you won't get picked"" I accepted my chances as I didn't want to reveal myself. Then after I didn't get picked for the 5 v 5 (Which doesn't matter to me, I was willing to sit out for a round) You said something along the lines of ""Reveal youself or just kick him Sam"". I replied with something like ""No, fuck you tantrew don't kick me because i'm smurfing"". I will admit this was ""weak trolling"" As I was not trying to troll, I would have said this logged in as well.   so we gave you a choice, to either reveal yourself, or to get kicked.   Yeah... this is what i'm trying to say, you shouldnt do this on a group called ""/r/spheremasterrace"". When i see a group called that I think ""All Welcome!"" as sphere is supposed to be a friendly community, smurfs and logged in accounts.   This happened in a group, controlled by players with an anti-smurfing policy.   Did it? Because I seem to recall the final 2 picks of the 5 v 5 game being me (playing as ""smurf"") and a logged out player as ""Some Ball"". Before that Nimbly was playing as a smurf as well.    Log in next time.   Like I said, I really shouldn't have to because there were other smurfs in that same group. If it were a private group or you wanted to pub or something I would have gladly left so you could play with friends. But don't create a group called ""/r/spheremasterrace"" If you don't want to include people."

spheremasterrace,2ptj1l,psychfan5,0,Fri Dec 19 22:14:57 2014 UTC,i dont think you did anything notable but I might have been somewhere else when you did say something. (like on mumble or the reddit)
spheremasterrace,2ptj1l,Mrsylvestermcbean,3,Fri Dec 19 22:18:13 2014 UTC,"I was not on mumble because I was smurfing, and I created the throwaway account after this instence of getting kicked. I had been smurfing for about 5 games in pubs (never played with you) and the 4 previous hockey games. Pls do not make up reasons for which I was kicked.  Also when I joined the group I even asked ""Got room for one more?"" You replied with ""Of course we do"" or something like that. You should have asked me to reveal myself as a smurf or something. Instead I was given no warning.  -Tantrew said to kick me for smurfing  -I said ""No, fuck you tantrew, you dont run sphere  -You said, but I run this group  -Kicked.  No warning was given.

spheremasterrace,2ptj1l,Omidio,1 point,Fri Dec 19 22:22:49 2014 UTC,I said i kick you because I run this group for dramatic affect most people wanted you to be kicked (for some reason I do not remember) and I took that chance to say something humermous
spheremasterrace,2ptj1l,realsquareball,1 point,Sat Dec 20 00:19:43 2014 UTC,"Well that sounds a little more reasonable. I'd still maybe hope recognizable players would be on the forgiving side with players we suspect are new or are low-level, but kicking someone from a group isn't quite the same as reporting them or something.   I've been voted before when smurfing and stats off, I think it might be influenced by that anonymity; things I say when I'm me people recognize as jokes or whatever but that doesn't really always translate when you don't know who you're talking to. In any case"
spheremasterrace,2ptj1l,psychfan5,3,Fri Dec 19 21:11:35 2014 UTC,"This is after I had been in the group for a good 4 or 5 games, not showing any signs of trollish behavior.

spheremasterrace,2pt61s,B-Comp,1 point,Fri Dec 19 19:21:25 2014 UTC,Does he chase when the flag is out of base? Or does he continue to sit on the button?
spheremasterrace,2pt61s,FatsP,1 point,Fri Dec 19 18:44:29 2014 UTC,"He usually tries to stay on the button closest to their flag, I think. Especially on Danger Zone."
spheremasterrace,2pt61s,B-Comp,1 point,Fri Dec 19 21:26:04 2014 UTC,"Button strats? Depends on that map of course. Also is he just sitting on the button? Ideally on Boombox and GeoKoala you don't ""sit"" on it - you just sit nearby and bait them in. Volt is also one of those maps where you can get burned by sitting on the button if you just sit there - or worse, 90% of the game you are doing nothing except racking up points from button camping. Button play has it's applications but I wouldn't say it's better than standard 2d configuration. Star is really the only acceptable map (I can think of) that gives button-camping a possible edge over the normal 2d strat- but even that is dependent on your defensive teammate's skill of course. I think the correct strat is button hold when you think you can get a kill, but when you need to contain your flag that takes #1 precedent everytime and no sitting on the button expecting the teammate to magically contain the flag by himself."
spheremasterrace,2pt61s,HotCarlHasTP,1 point,Fri Dec 19 19:07:09 2014 UTC,"In my experience, single-mindedly camping on a button is not a valid strat on any map.  The closest I ever get to this is on Danger Zone, Hurricane, and Jagged, where I'll camp the in-case button 100% of the time when I'm not collecting a PUP or defending the flag against enemies in base.  Defending GeoKoala and Smirk, it's best to have one defender next to the top button.  Colors button strats are a little hairy, but luckily that map died and is currently burning in Hell.  My issues with camping on a button:  You're leaving one man on D, which is basically guaranteeing that the enemy will get frequent good grabs.  Your team can't score with your flag vacant.  You're giving up any chance of effective no-grab D (which is the most effective D strat).  Even worse, if your team keeps 2 on D while you sit on a button all game, you're leaving one player on O, which means offensive D will be next to non-existent and your team will very rarely make an effective grab/escape.  After a minute or two of gameplay, everyone will know which gate you're controlling, and the enemies will avoid it.  You've effectively ""contained"" one route against the enemy FC at the cost of doing anything else useful for your team.  Unless that route is also extremely useful to your own FC (think Colors, maybe Star), you're hurting your team."

spheremasterrace,2pnyif,B-Comp,2,Thu Dec 18 21:32:49 2014 UTC,"To get less bad? Sadly no. That comes with time. But I can give you some tips on strategy so your team doesn't hate you as much as you start getting good.   Powerup (pup) guides Try to limit the amount of flaccid (grabbing only to pop 1 second later because you grab with no hope of getting out) grabs you make Try not to grab when you are last at their flag and the enemy fc is incoming Always keep one on regrab. The usual format when your flag is out of base is one player on regrab, and 2 chasing the enemy flag When the flag is out of your base, its better to chase it than to guard an empty base.   There's a lot more to learn and downloading mumble to play in some tournaments such as SOCL is a great way to learn"

spheremasterrace,2pky44,Mrsylvestermcbean,5,Wed Dec 17 20:18:32 2014 UTC,"So there once was this wasp that lived in a jungle. This was not your ordinary wasp though-he was smart, philosophical even. One day he finally got fed up with his repetitive, insignificant life and decided that he would leave his hive, his family, his entire close-knit wasp community and he would go out into the world and make something of himself, just like the humans do.   So the wasp enrolls in school, and passes with flying colors. Remember, this is a very smart wasp. He gets his high school diploma in a little under 3 years, with a 4.0 GPA and all that snazz. After high school, believe it or not, the wasp gets accepted to Harvard. Harvard! This too proves to be no challenge for our hero, as he graduates in just two years, again a 4.0, on the Dean's list, and all that snazz. Not to mention all the clubs and sports he was in-the newspaper, rowing, student government-and the fact that he was by far the most popular student on campus. Even his professors looked up to him.   He goes on to get two PhDs, and when he finishes his education, the wasp faces a bit of a dilemma. How does he apply his knowledge now? Where does he go from here? He decides to try out politics. After all, he was popular throughout school, did well in Harvard government. So he runs for mayor, and wins in a landslide. He greatly reforms the city, fixing virtually all its major problems. He runs for governor and again wins in a landslide. Two years later, the presidential election was coming up, and the wasp decides he might as well go for it.   Of course, he wins in the largest landslide in US presidential history. His presidency goes exceedingly well-he is loved by all parties, and has the highest approval ratings in history. He also finds the cures for cancer, AIDS, and broken hearts while in the White House. After 8 years (yes, of course he was reelected) the time has come for him to leave his office. Even his successor his saddened by the wasp’s departure, but they all know it’s what must be done.   Back at his vacation home in California his first day after leaving office, the wasp looks back on his long and fruitful life. He realizes that he hasn't been back to his hive at all since that first day he left. He suddenly feels a twang of guilt as he realizes how much he misses his parents and his little brother.   So he heads back to the hive, looking more worn out than he remembers. He goes inside and greets his family, who are overjoyed at the sight of him. He talks about how his life has gone as his family listens in wonderment.   Eventually he decides he is thirsty, so he decides to visit the old watering hole he remembered. Once he gets there though, there’s an extremely long line. He decides it’s worth the wait, so gets in line. One hour. Two hours. This is the slowest moving line he’s ever seen! Eventually he calculates that it could be a few days before he gets to the front of the line, so decides it’s not worth it. He decides to go get some cider to drink instead, but what do you know, another huge line of people waiting for cider! He remembers one other drinking area that never had a long line-fruit punch! So he decides to go get punch.   He arrives, and lo and behold, there's no punch line."

""It will be okay, I can protect you on your journey.""  The girl looked up at him, a concerned look masked her face.  ""But we have so far to go! They almost made it. I only killed the guy because I saw him heading into my home. I got so anxious I saw a flash of yellow. It's like the yellow flash boosted me to him. But now I have this and they will kill me for it. Once they take it from me and bring it into my home it's over.""   They were walking along as they chatted, the young girl nervously looking around while doing so. Her mentor, a more experienced player in this dangerous game, was unruffled. He spotted what he was looking for.  He shouted to her as he picked up the magic that would help them through their journey ""Quick! Follow me! Keep your eyes on my back, don't look at anything else. ""  She saw him and gasped, her mentor was glorious. A beautiful green light illuminated him, he looked powerful and decisive. She did as she was told easily because she couldn't look at anything else.  Their enemies were deterred by her protector, afraid of the illuminated man, fearing for their lives more then they wanted what she had. As he made his way to their destination, 2 more friends joined up with them, but before they got to the enemies home, his magic wore off.  ""Oh_Snap! I'm dead. They'll definitely get me now"" she moaned in anguish.  But thankfully her mentor and friends knew exactly what needed to be done, as the enemy realized he was no longer glowing green, they pulled back in, ready to take back what she had. Her teammates protected her by blocking the bad guys. They did it so well that they didn't even touch her!   With their help, she made it into their base, she planted the beautiful golden flag. Game Over.  She looked at her mentor and protector and said ""Thank you, Snapple, nice lead,"" She then looked at her teammates and said ""Thanks, Cyanide and Tangnent. We did it""  Oh_Snap! only nodded his head, Cyanide replied with a np and Tangent corrected the girl on the proper spelling of his name.  gg nore"

spheremasterrace,2pky44,Mrsylvestermcbean,1 point,Thu Dec 18 18:03:33 2014 UTC,"Finally, I now have an opportunity to share with you a crucial piece of knowledge that will change your perspective on life: you have been lied to. Billions of children around the world are being taught today of the Earth's oblate spheroid geometry, but I have convincing evidence that the Earth, contrary to what you have been told, is actually flat. Don't believe me? Consider these counterarguments to minutephysics' video: Top 10 Reasons Why We Know the Earth Is Round.   Other planets are round.   Here's a fun fact for you: Earth is different. There are two types of planets: planets that are round, and planets that host life. Show me one round planet in the night sky that has life, and this argument will be invalid. But without any evidence stronger than simply conjecture, it is scientifically irresponsible to assume that Earth is like other planets just because.   Time Zones   In order to properly explain why we have time zones in a flat earth, I must preface this argument with another mind-blowing revelation: gravity is not as you have been taught. Nothing exerts a gravitational force simply by having matter; otherwise, you would have trillions of bodies accelerating towards each other until a massive collision results. No, what you know as gravity is actually the flat Earth being pushed up at a rate of 9.81 meters per square second.  Now, the reason why we have time zones is because the sun is revolving around the planar center of the flat earth, or as you know it, the North Pole, completing one revolution every 24 hours. The lateral distance between the sun and the North Pole varies; in the summer, the distance is negligible, while during winter, the distance approaches that of the radius of the Earth, moving along the circumference of Antarctica. Because of this phenomenon, at certain times of the day, some regions of the Earth receive more sunlight than other regions, thus creating differences between night and day.   The Coriolis Effect   This ""observation"" is simply a blatant lie. Consider this map that depicts the routes of 28,000 rubber ducks after a shipping incident caused a cargo container holding these toys to go overboard. According to the Coriolis Effect, these ducks should've started to travel in a counter-clockwise manner, but as evident by the map provided, their motion resembles nothing marginally close to a circle. The Coriolis Effect is a lie.   On a round surface, if you travel x feet, turn right 90 degrees and travel x feet, then turn right 90 degrees, you will end up back where you started, creating a triangle with 90 degree angles.   I just went outside to do this experiment. After following the procedure outlined above, I ended up x feet away from my starting location. Why don't you try it yourself if you don't believe me.   The sun gets lower and lower as you travel further from the equator   Once again, this is caused by the sun moving around the Earth, not the other way around.   The stars change as you travel across latitudes.   All celestial bodies, not just the sun, are moving around the center of the Earth. The stars are no exception.   Ferdinand Magellan's crew circumnavigated the Earth.   Magellan's crew sailed in a circle around the Earth. Next argument, please.   Objects appear on the horizon, beginning with the top. If the Earth was flat, we would be able to see thousands of miles across.   Not true. Even light is affected by gravity, and distant objects are so far away from observers that light reflected off of those objects fall to the ground before they reach observers. In the case of tall towers and skyscrapers, light reflected off the top has a longer trajectory due to their larger distance from the ground, thus being able to reach observers sooner than light from the bottom of objects.   The Earth casts a shadow during eclipses.   False. The shadow observed during eclipses are caused by the sun traveling behind the moon or vice versa.   Photographic evidence   These photos of a round Earth are fabricated by Hollywood in order to make thrilling space films which, while they can be entertaining, are largely inaccurate. You would be foolish to simply accept these photos as fact without questioning them.  You see? All this ""Earth is round"" talk is pure fiction and should be treated as so. Even the United Nations organization agrees and endorses the Flat Earth theory, as proven by their flag, on which they have placed the map of the flat Earth. And if, after all of this, you still don't believe me, why don't you try giving me one of your other silly arguments that supposedly prove the Earth's round shape, and I will tell you exactly why that theory is wrong."

People eliminated early in the first season have something else to do while people waiting for the second season do too. The group was also active until 11:30 last night. I don't know if it will always last that long, but there should be plenty of time to join if you're interested."

spheremasterrace,2phy2w,B-Comp,3,Tue Dec 16 19:36:15 2014 UTC,"I could just be imagining this or I don't know, maybe this is actually a thing. I tend to play more in the morning from like 10 AM to 3 PM and I am starting to get a little annoyed with the amount of AFK players. It just seems like the probability of getting a player AFK in the morning/early afternoon is significantly higher than when playing in the late afternoon/evening. Has anyone else had the same thought? Im thinking kids playing from school might have something to do with it."
spheremasterrace,2phy2w,FatsP,6,Tue Dec 16 19:36:48 2014 UTC,yeah... I think it's people playing from school/work.  I've noticed this too

spheremasterrace,2pbg7f,Slime666,2,Mon Dec 15 03:21:49 2014 UTC,I was watching the stream and couldn't figure out the point system. How did the captains obtain points to buy players? Also grats everyone that got drafted.
spheremasterrace,2pbg7f,JBaayBaay,2,Mon Dec 15 05:18:56 2014 UTC,"Well all teams (except the NLTP teams) get 100 points to do what they want.  NLTP teams only get 60 points because they get to string along 4 players from last season.  Theres also keeper points, which can be spent on players that have been on your team in the past.  All teams get 10 of these. Then they bid like a regular auction draft.    Seems more confusing than it should be tbh."
spheremasterrace,2pbg7f,psychfan5,2,Mon Dec 15 05:27:20 2014 UTC,"It does seem a little confusing, but I think it is the most fair way to do it. This allows players to not just be drafted by the team that nominates them."

spheremasterrace,2p7g50,sam202tagpro,2,Sun Dec 14 13:18:58 2014 UTC,"I mean, I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of it, but mostly that's because the position gets so often abused by lazy players who don't want to chase/defend. I understand its utility, though, and will even play that position myself,  but it should be a more fluid position rather than 1 player ""calling re"" and only doing that all game.  /endrant/"
spheremasterrace,2p7g50,acrocanthosaurus,2,Sun Dec 14 16:55:01 2014 UTC,Ok I see your side and totally agree with people being re a lot because they will not chase. I am only re a lot because no one else will be re (generally) and i feel like no one on re teams lose more games. I have been winning 50% percent of my games when I re commonly or have someone who will re but before i new about re and after I got half decent at the game (between rank 35-50) I was losing 60-75% of my games because no re. I feel like there needs to be a re if our team has a flag carrier and that the re should GENERALLY be the first person there (with the exception of having a rb and jj). I do not think you are my nemesis but I see we disagree on how serious to take re when pubbing.
spheremasterrace,2p7g50,sam202tagpro,2,Sun Dec 14 17:21:43 2014 UTC,"I'd say exception to first person to get there is also if you both know one is way better at o or d. If I'm on re and you end up next to me at their flag, I'm gonna go chase because I'm better at chasing than carrying and you're more likely to cap than I would be."

spheremasterrace,2p5p0w,BRISKET_PLS,6,Sat Dec 13 07:46:58 2014 UTC,"I know everyone has mentioned everything, but there's an easier way to categorize them:   Heavy commitment leagues: MLTP/mLTP/NLTP. These are the most organized, and require a 10 week commitment, of which consists of several practices a week (usually 1-3, depending on captain) and gameday. You don't have to show up to every single game/practice, but don't miss out on too many (and if you do, oh well. it's just a game, though your team might dislike you. Or they'll forget about you.) Medium commitment league: US contenders. Make a team of 7 with friends/random people, or join another team that has space. Once you make a team, you start at the bottom of the ""ladder"". You challenge teams higher up (within a certain range), and if you win, you take their spot. Try to make it to number one. There are currently 5 self-declared sphere teams, but only 2 of them consist of pure-sphere players (technically only 1, since the Spheremongerers have mastercard, who is an origin player). Help represent sphere, and bring it to the top. Also, all games are scheduled by the team captains, so you could have games as frequently as you want, and at what ever time works best for you. You can go 2 weeks without playing a single game, or you could go 2 weeks and play like 6 games. Low commitment leagues: SOCL and CLTP. These are basically nightly tournaments. The term ""tournament"" is interchangeable with ""season"". For SOCL, there are 2 seasons a day, with the first one being on origin, and the second one being on sphere. Signups for the first season are up at around 6:20 pm CST, and the draft starts at 7pm. Games start at around 7:20-30. As long as you sign up on time, you are guaranteed to be drafted. This is a fun way to play with MLTP/mLTP players that you usually wouldn't have been able to play with. The commitment for a season is only 10 minutes to 2 hours, depending on how far you make it in the season. Signups for the second season usually start at around 8:30 pm, and the draft usually starts at 9, though recently it's been starting a bit later. CLTP is the same thing, except all the seasons take place on centra, and they are late at night. idk when the start time is, but it usually goes on during midnight, all the way until 2 am. Both of those leagues take place everyday, so you can show up whenever you want. SOCL and CLTP are both great ways to get noticed by MLTP captains. You have no chance of getting drafted in MLTP/mLTP if the captains don't know who you are. Lowest commitment- Ranked pugs. Link: http://lejdesigns.com/rankedPUGs/ Commit 10 minutes to playing a game on mumble with other players. This also allows you to get paired with/against MLTP/mLTP players, and has it's own stat tracking (Tracks wins/losses only). It works based off of an ELO system, and you can level up by winning/level down by losing. These are really fun too, but usually there aren't 8 people to start it up until 5pm CST."
spheremasterrace,2p5p0w,Omidio,5,Sat Dec 13 19:09:52 2014 UTC,"Alright, so you have MLTP and NLTP.  MLTP encompasses Majors and Minors(also refered to as mLTP), and is where the best of the best are, anybody in here is amazing, and they have a regular season of ~10 games, their record determines playoffs or not.   You can sign up for MLTP now, but they've already drafted the first round of picks, and will draft rounds 2-5 this weekend. I think this season they will draft using a money and auction format (idk what else to call it), where captain have a budget to try to win player auctions.   After this weekend, they'll draft rounds 6-10, and if you dont get picked theyll Reddit PM you with a link to sign up for NLTP (if you didnt sign up for MLTP, there will be a post on the main sub with a sign up link too).  NLTP is a catch all league meant to help players develop their skills, where everyone who signs up gets drafted and gets playing time if they show up. They draft all rounds (28 last season) at once in one day in the normal format where captains take turns picking players they want.   After you're drafted, your captain will hit you up with a reddit PM and invite you to moderate a private subreddit made for the team. You use the moderator mail of the sub to announce events and practices and such.   Your team gets their own mumble channel that you get to use when you practice and play. Practices vary on the team, mine practiced 1-2 times a week during NLTP s2 and s3, but a friend of mines last season practiced 3-4 times a week (all optional ofcourse, you didn't have to come, and usually alot of people weren't there)  In NLTP you have A-team and B-team (sometimes referred to as nLTP), everybody cam get b-team minutes and playing time, while A-team is usually the best 4-5 players.  Its pretty fun. If you have anymore questions just ask me haha"

She's super, super bad at it right now and I apologize if you get her on your team. I'm sure she'll pick it up and get better though!  Any road, please be nice to her and try to help/coach her if you see her, her name is Doglady and I'm not going to explain how to change that to her. Also she might play as me if she forgets to log herself in so if I'm super bad all of a sudden (worse than usual, I know) please don't report.  Help me get a new sphere player and show her that everything I've said about you all is true!  Thanks friends :]"

spheremasterrace,2oga6r,mythology_guy,1 point,Sat Dec 6 14:47:03 2014 UTC,"Sounds like a pretty shoddy and possibly unsafe work area. For starters don't sweep any concrete or quikcrete without longsleeves, eye protection, or a breathing mask and don't do anything you don't feel safe doing. If you feel you or your co-workers are being unsafe the easiest thing you guys can do is quickly debrief what can go wrong and figure out ways to prevent it. If you feel it's a legal matter and your company is endangering you, then you may want to file a complaint at OSHA and see what they think about the safety hazards. They could send an inspector out but I don't know how these things work when they hit OSHA."
spheremasterrace,2oga6r,B-Comp,1 point,Sat Dec 6 17:31:50 2014 UTC,"That's fucked up. I don't know how things work in Canada, but you should try reading about the occupational safety and health legislation there.   From wikipedia:   In Canada, workers are covered by provincial or federal labour codes depending on the sector in which they work. Workers covered by federal legislation (including those in mining, transportation, and federal employment) are covered by the Canada Labour Code; all other workers are covered by the health and safety legislation of the province in which they work. The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS), an agency of the Government of Canada, was created in 1966 by an Act of Parliament. The act was based on the belief that all Canadians had ""...a fundamental right to a healthy and safe working environment."" CCOHS is mandated to promote safe and healthy workplaces to help prevent work-related injuries and illnesses. The CCOHS maintains a useful (partial) list of OSH regulations for Canada and its provinces.   You may want to check that, because it does sound like a hazardous place"

spheremasterrace,2o7533,TheSleepyJesus,1 point,Thu Dec 4 09:41:21 2014 UTC,"My rep precedes me, for a reason. As far as I know this claim is bs. Unless someone was smurfing under my name, I have no logical reason why realsquareball would make a claim like this. I've played with him before so I know he wouldn't make it without a legit reason."
spheremasterrace,2o7533,Aaron215,1 point,Mon Dec 8 03:25:45 2014 UTC,Hope it was someone else smurfing under your name.  I didn't think you played that way.  Just so I don't make this mistake again next time we play... Only for Lioness' eyes
spheremasterrace,2o7533,Jatgoggin,1 point,Mon Dec 8 18:27:50 2014 UTC,I dunno why someone would smurf under my name though so it doesn't make sense :'(
spheremasterrace,2o7533,sam202tagpro,1 point,Tue Dec 9 05:07:11 2014 UTC,"Sorry that I jumped on something where someone was making things up. I was drunk when I left that comment and it was off whiskey and it became an ""angry drunk""   While this is no excuse but I was kinda just being rude all night. I cant imagine how it would feel to find a thread where everyone from our community was talking about something made up I did.   Sorry again and I look forward to playing with you!"
spheremasterrace,2o7533,B-Comp,1 point,Tue Dec 9 06:17:14 2014 UTC,Not at all :)  I understand people making drunk comments ;)  Not from err experience or anything :P

spheremasterrace,2o7533,ArgieGrit01,3,Mon Dec 8 13:17:59 2014 UTC,"Yep, sounds cheap. I sometimes take pups while waiting - it's not a big deal, especially if you and the opposing player both take one - however using a TagPro as soon as the other teammate spawns, then grabbing for a cap - that isn't very cool. But then again, who hasn't spawned in a 2v2 only to get completely mauled by an opposing TagPro? Until the developers consider an option for the players to ""freeze"" or ""pause"" a new game (to populate teams) then this type of behavior will always exist in TagPro. JMO"
spheremasterrace,2o7533,ArgieGrit01,1 point,Thu Dec 4 14:26:02 2014 UTC,"Kirby, you and I both know I wouldn't do that. (Yes, I'm trying to clear the air since I've received some hate over this :()"
spheremasterrace,2o7533,ArgieGrit01,2,Mon Dec 8 03:27:23 2014 UTC,"If it is 2v2 situation but it is with 4 people in a group I would say start. IF it was 3 people in your group so 1v2 that would be the most likely scenrio to ""joke around"""
spheremasterrace,2o7533,hydraskull1,1 point,Thu Dec 4 12:55:29 2014 UTC,Same thing I said to Kirby
spheremasterrace,2o7533,hydraskull1,4,Mon Dec 8 03:27:34 2014 UTC,"Typically when waiting, I'll just sit on a button to get some support points while I wait.  I agree: if teams are 2v1 or 3v2, wait in your own base. But don't hold it against someone who doesn't; I once had someone who capped against me to win a 4v1, but as far as I know, we're on amicable terms."

spheremasterrace,2o0cz4,hydraskull1,7,Tue Dec 2 03:23:05 2014 UTC,"I had a long chat with @(-_-)@ a few days ago and while I got the vibe that he was being an asshole, I attempted to introduce him to the world of the competitive scene, where his actual skill will get tested (since I've heard he shit-talks about players being bad). I've yet to see his actions in game, but I told him I will follow up with a report or talk to the mods if he continues to be a dick to members of our community."
spheremasterrace,2o0cz4,xKillaCuddleSx,2,Tue Dec 2 18:10:51 2014 UTC,"I can agree to the 25% trash talking, but our main discussion was over attitude toward other players, and how the community has been handling it. You're correct in saying that I never outright stated ""I would report you"", but I thought I very well much implied I was against being an asshole to our community, and that appropriate actions would be taken against people who met the conditions. Remember that? I brought up my rookie hype for about 10 minutes since we were in-between discussion of talking about playing competitive Tagpro. I've tried to be courteous with you, but you're making it real hard to be even somewhat considerable. You have this trend to call out others based on their behavior, and yet all I see from you is talk. It's very clear here who is actually trying to ""impress these people."""
spheremasterrace,2o0cz4,xKillaCuddleSx,1 point,Thu Dec 4 19:24:14 2014 UTC,"You obviously see it differently, but I didn't talk shit about you (I don't see a point in any of my text where I call you out on anything). I've only ever seen you play once so I can't even have an opinion on your skill and my feelings towards your behavior have already been mentioned above (Stating what I've heard from others, as you can read above). You can't call bullshit on truth - it doesn't even make any sense."
spheremasterrace,2o0cz4,xKillaCuddleSx,3,Fri Dec 5 00:33:35 2014 UTC,"Tantrew got through to him to some extent, I need to ask Tantrew about that actually"
spheremasterrace,2o0cz4,mythology_guy,3,Fri Dec 5 01:32:59 2014 UTC,I don't think Tantrew got anywhere with that guy... usually if you go around calling X a bad player or Y a noob I don't think that guy is a good player himslef
spheremasterrace,2o0cz4,ArgieGrit01,3,Fri Dec 5 05:57:48 2014 UTC,"Idk, Tantrew was trying to get him to warm up, but his behavior hasn't changed. He also didn't respond when I semi-threatened him, but whatever"
spheremasterrace,2o0cz4,mythology_guy,2,Tue Dec 2 20:24:56 2014 UTC,Yeah I was so mad at this guy the first time I played with him but I just ignore him now. Its sad to see though bc he sometimes calls out players who are just starting or lvl 15 or less and it probably discourages them from playing...
spheremasterrace,2o0cz4,aumisdabomb,4,Wed Dec 3 01:38:18 2014 UTC,"Agreed. And if you can take a screenshot or record them, that's even better. The mods can see the chat, but they lack a lot of context.  Remeber, this people are here to get a reaction out of players. Don't be like me and ignore them :P"

He was coming into base on CFB through the narrow end between the bombs and spikes, and i tried to defuse those bombs before he got there, but i ended up pushing him backwards into mid, not even killing him. He then proceeded to cuss me out and not play for most of the rest of the game, saying he had everyone beat (when there were 2 in front of him -_-) and i intentionally did it. When he DID play, it was trying to kill me. Glad to know everyone is aware that the dude is a dick and i wasn't wrong lol"
