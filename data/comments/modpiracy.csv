Regardless they fail to address one of my larger concerns regarding paid mods (Beside Quality control) is how the mods will work post release and with a maybe later patch or conflicts with other mods.  And what about dependencies ?    And this i still got to mention outright stolen content.
modpiracy,3dsjgz,Opira,10,Sun Jul 19 02:47:31 2015 UTC,I'd be okay with paid mods if Bethesda were picking and choosing a couple big mods. Where they're almost DLC level. But only if they intend to help keep them updated and working.

I have a bit of concern that Bethesda is going to try and kill the modding scene before it is born, that way, nobody can complain that they are ruining a pre-existing community.

modpiracy,3dkuv9,Sword_n_board,16,Fri Jul 17 04:56:04 2015 UTC,Exactly this. The only way paid mods will work is if Bethesda pays the modders for them and sells them as DLC with official support.

modpiracy,3dkuv9,doctorsawbones,14,Sun Jul 19 00:01:53 2015 UTC,"On a related note, they said.   Back in April, Bethesda pointed out that 25 percent has been the standard cut for modders since the Steam Workshop opened its storefront years ago. In fact, the entire Steam Workshop community has together made $57 million since 2011 at the 25 percent rate.   Those aren't mods. Those are creations made, and then put onto a storfront by Valve who will continue to support them and be added to and item drop system. Said items have value as they are cosmetics that are shown to others in game. People like buying collectibles and shit like that."
modpiracy,3dkuv9,Lyratheflirt,43,Fri Jul 17 16:42:51 2015 UTC,"I hate that Bethesda is fallaciously saying ""But 25% has been the norm for ages on the workshop"".  Yes, except, Bethesdas MODS are different to that of the other content on the Workshop.  All other monetised workshop content is entirely cosmetic, from DOTA and CSGO.  This content is also ""officialised"" and supported by Valve.  Bethesda however didn't want to do any of that. They wanted to keep it unofficial, unsupported. Also the mods proposed being sold take a lot more work that the ""workshop standard"" content.  A new Dota 2 weapon model and skin may take ONE person around 10-15 hours and it is then taken by valve, added to the game and a revenue split shared.  Now compare to Fallout or Skyrim, most worthy mods are from a team of 5-6 people (sometimes much more re Falskaar), with hundreds of hours per person. The content is sold, revenue split but any work needed to ensure it keeps working is on the mod team.  The Split made sense when the content was officialised because Valve was actually doing something for their split. Valve got 30% for content hosting, gave 25% to the modders and the rest was Valves fee for officialising / maintaining the content.  Now though? 30% to valve for hosting (A-OK), 25% to Modders for creating (A-OK), and the rest to bethesda for.... creating an editor (which they would have probably made anyway and is useless without people modding with it anyway).  The effort required on each side in this example is too far apart. Modders put in the most effort, Valve and beth put in none."
modpiracy,3dkuv9,Xzal,12,Fri Jul 17 11:52:32 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that the mod creator already paid a price for the editor, since it was included in the game.

As for paid mods, as much as you hate the idea, most people - myself included -  aren't completely averse to paid mods. Paid mods might be new to Bethesda games but they've been around almost as long as PC gaming (see: Flight Simulator games, paid mods are a cottage industry there).  The lesson I hope Bethesda would have learned from the Skyrim paid mod debacle is not allowing paid mods to be turned into a free-for-all for any Tom, Dick or Harry to make a simple ESP edit and try to charge 5 dollars for it. Additionally a curated store with moderators who inspect and certify mods to ensure garbage mods aren't allowed through, establishing some kind of quality control, mechanisms to ensure stolen or unauthorized content can't be used, and a refund policy that is fair to the end user. I think if they find a way to implement all that most objections to paid mods would melt. If not then I guess we'll see a return of the Immersive Apple mod, among other prank mods.

If they are intent on pushing this system out, then I hope they will at least be smart about it and come up with a system that makes more sense for everyone involved."
modpiracy,3dkuv9,balanceofpower,3,Fri Jul 17 16:30:29 2015 UTC,I bought oblivion skyrim fallout new Vegas and fallout 3. I respected Bethesda up till the paid mods fiasco. So it's not looking for an excuse to pirate the game. I don't need an excuse for that. I would gladly have bought it if they still had my respect. It's not even about whether I get to play the game either. It's about sending them a message. Remember how spore became the most pirated game because of DRM in 2008?  You think it's because of people just wanting to play the game for free rather than the fact that people wanted to send EA a message about how they viewed their DRM? Enjoy your pip boy edition.
modpiracy,3dkuv9,Spirit_Panda,-4,Fri Jul 17 06:30:50 2015 UTC,Pirating games is a cottage industry here.
modpiracy,3dkuv9,lordunholy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:39:32 2015 UTC,"I guess most if not even all of us now that it's almost impossible to make a bug-free game. Bethesda is no exception to this. But unless other developers, they often end up not fixing bugs, leaving it up to the community.  Let's say that a couple of community members are getting together to make an unofficial patch (as it has happened countless times before) to address these issues. If they now decide to monetize it (which is already controversial in my opinion), they sell it as mod - but only get 25% of the revenue. Bethesda, however, gets 30% for doing nothing.  I mean, we already have plenty of developers/ publishers releasing unfinished games and fixing bugs sometimes over a long period of time that should have never been in the release version at all. Now, I really wouldn't be surprised at all if some of them even had the guts to gladly take a cut of 30% of the revenue made from selling unofficial patches."

I'm not moralfagging and applauding those bans for their supposed anti-pedo nature, It's saying that was a sensible move from nexus staff to cover their own arses. If you host a site with thousands of mods, one dodgy mod can cause the whole thing to go under. Banning one cp-like mod is a lesser of two evils, the best way out in present circumstances.

Loli in general is an oddly large genre and it becomes very trouble some when you get an artist who draws them in a way that they just look like flat chested women and then you get to page 4-5 and you get an age or school grade and then you have to nope the hell outta the manga.

modpiracy,3bgl28,kelvindevogel,4,Fri Jul 3 14:17:40 2015 UTC,They've almost got it right though. Just remove the survey crap and you'll be left with a great implementation of paid mods.
modpiracy,3bgl28,GTA5Base,-6,Mon Jun 29 22:29:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe you are right, but.... Users haven't used to paid mods, that's why we've decided to place the surveys. For main countries (USA, UK, CA, DE, FR, PL, JP and much, much more) we have really nice surveys - just registration process. It takes 30 (really) second to complete it and... that's it.   It is not a problem to fill them and authors gets revenue for their hard work.  Of course for some countries we have worse surveys but we are working on that to make them better."
modpiracy,3bgl28,drhead,9,Tue Jun 30 00:06:09 2015 UTC,"There are problems with the surveys though.    First off, they ask for very personal information.  They ask for an email address with the intent of sending ""marketing offers"" (i.e. unwanted spam), while rejecting ANYTHING that might be a throwaway, even gmail addresses.  This means I would have to use my ISP provided email address which I don't want to get spam.  For most people, that is a sacrifice not worth making for downloading one mod.  People will either leak your mods or simply not download them, and you will be wasting your time trying to monetize them.  Second, they aren't 30 seconds.  You should really look through some of them.  They are mostly 50 question long surveys.  Sure, maybe you could answer it in a minute by answering randomly, but that kind of defeats the point of the survey.  Personally, I would have the patience to do a three minute survey as long as it doesn't ask for my email address, doesn't ask for me to buy anything through a referral program, and doesn't ask me if I know anyone who is diabetic every other fucking question, but others have less patience than I do.  Third, your site still looks shady as fuck, and that is going to scare users away and make them start looking in places like this to find your mods.  Start by running everything through a spellchecker, I noticed several glaring errors last time I visited your site.  Ideally, abandon the survey model, since these same survey sites are used rather frequently in so-called ""niche"" scams where a site promises something (like a free laptop, a free game key, etc) where the user never actually gets anything in return, or the user is asked to buy cruise tickets through a referral program or something else ridiculous like that.  Fourth, there are instances where the surveys don't even work, which happened to me every time until I used an override download link provided by the modder.  That's a bad thing.  I do hope you are continuing to monitor your reddit account, since I think you should know why I decided to leak some of your mods, so that you may improve your site to the point where I don't have to do that."

modpiracy,3bbksy,BalefirePhoenix,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:18:34 2015 UTC,"The main ""problem"" is that Bethesda doesn't like their content being redistributed without permission, so the people making the mods either need to replace the content with their own or provide a tool that'll pull the content from an existing (and probably unpirated, if there's a way to check that) version of the game. Skywind and Skyblivion pretty much have to rebuild their assets, the most they can use is the ESMs and even those are going to need to change a lot, but the ESMs are still Bethesda's. The Fallout 2 to NV thing wasn't even a port, it was just a straight up remake, I don't think you even can use anything from Fallout 2 besides maybe some sound files. TTW, on the otherhand, straight up ports almost all the Fallout 3 content into New Vegas, with only a few changes to the ESMs because they're both running on more similar versions of the engine compared to any other conversion project out there."

Now, we want to support developers whether they be developing mods or video games at the same time though we do not want to support unethical practices. So we must walk a fine line between being outright thieves and complacent peasants.  Now in Law Enforcement we learn ""community orientated policing"". This differs from legalistic style as the LEOs are given more leeway when it comes to enforcing the laws.  Now, yes, you are correct that in my example that both of the people are thieves by legal per say. However, under Community Orientated Policing, I as the LEO would be given some discretion under what crimes to prosecute as long as it not a felony or DV.  With that in mind, that discretion is what we at /r/modpiracy do when pirating. We use piracy primarily as an act of protest rather than primarily a way to get things for free.   We do not, as you put it so apt, ""want to shit on"" developers. We love video games and the mods that come with it. If we all pirated all our games and waved our dicks at modders then we would have neither.  We need the balance of piracy and respect, with the extreme on either end being intolerable.  So I do not mind if someone pirates a game, as long as it is part of a valid protest. If you pirate a game just because you are cheap, then we are at an impasse. This goes triple for those who pirate non-AAA games as those developers need the money.  The Jimquisition did an excellent video on piracy that I implore you to watch."

Think what we are doing is okay with modders, go ask the modders whose mods have been pirated by us here.

There is no justification for it, we are stealing from people and attempts to justify to ourselves are pointless and pretty stupid because no one else agrees.

modpiracy,3au42e,The_Scout1255,2,Tue Jun 23 20:49:43 2015 UTC,"I am reading what the sidebar says. So unless a mod tells me different, I am going with what the founders have told everyone.  Edit: on mobile, just saw mod post below. I have to say I disagree with the practice and I am curious if the other mods are in agreement, and if so; why the sidebar has not been updated.  If the april boycott that created the sub reddit has taught us anything is that we should respect modders so that they do not do unscrupulous practices such as paywall their mods.   Modders who put their work up for free only expect two things for their hard work. 1. A thank you, and 2. We respect their terms of use if they state it. If we do not even give them this after the hard work they put into their mods, then we are no better than the rabble the ""game journalists"" made us out to be."

I mean I get if mod x is paywalled and someone with a pirated copy downloads it. But if mod Y is a workshop exclusive, and Leeroy Jenkins wants to download it but didn't buy the game, surely that is a different story.  The sub-reddit supports free modder's rights, no?

The economy there got so bad the city printed their own money because the country's currency was almost worthless. Though I haven't lived in the country (though I visit my friend's there often) for over a decade, I sympathise with your plight. Though, I do not agree with your request.  There are a great deal of mods hosted on Skyrim Nexus that you can use. Normally a modder uploads a workshop exclusive if they want to reward people who bought the game. They do the work without want of pay, so I say we should respect their wishes as a gesture of thanks. Uploading to the workshop isn't egregious enough of a wall to warrant the destruction of the modder's rights."

If people are willing to donate $5 or $10 to a mod creator how much more to a game developer. When people are given freedom and a choice, you tend to see the good side come out more often than when they are forced to pay $60 or whatever for a game they're not even sure they'll like. If offered a choice for donation, how much more willing would they be to donate $60 or $100 to a game dev for a game they truly love?  Oh wait, I forget who I'm talking to: the crowd that waits until Steam Sales to buy all their games for $5 a pop or shells $3 to HumbleBundle for 10 games or whatever that will get them.  Yeah it's a pipe dream, but I do believe that in a perfect world, a donation model would work."

modpiracy,3agzev,TurboBr0,15,Sat Jun 20 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"Final Doom in my opinion was fleshed out enough and polished enough to justify being sold. My problems with how Valvethesda did it was a mixture of the lairze faire attitude which allowed for free mods to be stolen and uploaded for a price on the Steam Workshop (e.g. the monster mounts) and the fact that the content wasn't worth it at all. Like compare it to Bethesda's own offerings with the Fighter's Keep and Mage's Tower in Oblivion and Dragonborn. Even Hearthfire which was considered lacking in content was filled to the brim with new content compared to lolhalflifemod with a premade model and a samey dungeon. I'm sorry to the modders that made the paid content if it hurts but the content you provide along with the prices aren't worth it at all, especially when there's plenty of games for the same/similar prices that offer bucket loads of content in comparison. Like most paid mods on Valvethesda were $3-4 and games around that price at the time of writing are Fallout 3, New Vegas, Terraria, Torchlight 2, Age of Empires 2 HD and so on. You're not offering a lot of value for the pricetag you have.  Like personal opinion but for me if SureAI was contacted by Bethesda to sell Enderal as a standalone game and was allowed to use Bethesda's Creation Kit rather than our cutdown version to polish up Enderal I'd pay for it because Enderal as it's looking right now is packed to the brim with new content."
modpiracy,3agzev,BoomRockDopSop,6,Sat Jun 20 06:25:42 2015 UTC,"This is what people need to remember. Paid content is not a bad thing. If it's fully sanctioned and tested by the publisher/developer, I don't really give a shit if their team or a team of modders made it. Quality content is quality content. Where Valve and Bethesda went wrong was thinking that every modder who charges money is going to deliver a quality content. Or, at the very least, they felt the market would weed out the bad stuff, which has worked out so well for Early Access, hasn't it?"
modpiracy,3agzev,poopnuts,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:09:33 2015 UTC,"Good point. They handled it pretty well with Doom as it wasn't just some lazy reskin for $10-20. I mostly posted this here because of how the reactions from the usenet group was eerily similar to that of what Bethesda did. Probably because it was an entirely new concept for them 20 years ago.  If they try to do paid modding again for Fallout 4, it should be stuff on par with Enderal and Falksaar and properly curated. Otherwise I'll just torrent the mods if they fuck it up agaiin."

Then, I found Join the NCR on KickAssTorrents, so I posted it to people asking for the mod in his comments section. He then blocked me from his website, got my IP address and threatened to call the police for... I don't fucking know...   So, I left him alone after that, like one would with that of a small, unintimidating, butthurt hive of wasps. However, then I found this link from one of the people in his comment section with the same idea as me.

Seeing as Bethesda is going to start routing more of their mods directly through their company instead of third parties I fully expect paid mods to be a thing.   They're cutting out the middle man of Valve so that their cut will be 30-49% and that removes that part of the argument... Running mods through Bethesda also allows them more opportunity for them to do some quality control and keep out mods they don't like (See: Schlongs of Skyrim).  I don't think they'll ever really shut out third party mod providers, but I'm 90% sure they're going to take another run at paid mods with Fallout 4."
modpiracy,3aabq5,magor1988,0,Fri Jun 19 07:12:13 2015 UTC,"It would only hurt their pockets and reputation, so it is very unlikely unless Valve curates and sanctions it like they do with TF2 addons. When they didn't it almost turned into a mobile App Store."
modpiracy,3aabq5,Kraosdada,2,Mon Jun 22 13:23:07 2015 UTC,"What pissed off the community was not just the Paid Mods, it was the theft of free mods and selling them for cash. It was mostly the lack of quality of the first mods.   Saw that Lambda Detector? one of the most horrificaly bad mods i had ever seen.   Art of the Catch and Castle Volkihar Rebuilt were just tests and they did NOT go well at all.  Also, a lot of mods that used to be FREE had become PAID like Wet and Cold, iNeed, Skyforge Weapons.  In the end the ONLY mod that was actually worth any money was Gifts of Akatosh.  And something that really REALLY pissed off everyone was the fact that Xilver put ADS on the Midas Magic mod."
modpiracy,3aabq5,Kraosdada,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:27:51 2015 UTC,"I will be convinced, if, and probably only if, they absolutly close the door to monetization in their EULA, with something like ""You are not allowed to charge for mods, if you charge for a mod, or, put a price on a mod, then, you consent to give automatic copy right to anyone, and everyone, irrevocably"". Or something like that. Not ""prevent"" by trying to stop them, but, by forcing it open if someone asks for cash for a mod, them included."
modpiracy,3aabq5,ChestBras,17,Thu Jun 18 23:47:14 2015 UTC,"We might still see them but in a more curated format and they're likely to use the console platform to warm everyone up to the idea first. It's like having them pay for online access or pre-orders or exclusive DLC's. There's not much they can do to protest because they already own the console and have no other good games to play on it so they pretty much have to give in.  A place that didn't have mods to begin with is a prime area to test paid mods again. And once the console peasants users get warmed up to the idea, they can say well it works here let's try it again on PC now that more people are cool with this."
modpiracy,3aabq5,FacialMondays,3,Thu Jun 18 14:58:06 2015 UTC,"I still wonder if we do see a script extender for fallout 4 will it also show up on the console, since without it then not all mods would work."
modpiracy,3aabq5,RiffyDivine2,13,Thu Jun 18 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the selection of mods available on console will be quite limited, and it would be interesting if they had to go through rating systems like ESRB as well."
modpiracy,3aabq5,Masenkoe,2,Thu Jun 18 19:02:36 2015 UTC,Well they keep saying all the mods a PC gets the consoles will get which sounds weird unless they plan to be the only source for mods.
modpiracy,3aabq5,RiffyDivine2,9,Thu Jun 18 19:39:43 2015 UTC,They've already said no mods from other games and no nudity. So they're definitely screening the mods that console users can get.
modpiracy,3aabq5,rocktheprovince,2,Thu Jun 18 20:15:14 2015 UTC,That worries me a bit but I am going to hope I am just being tinfoil hat about it. The idea of them in charge of mods is spooky.
modpiracy,3aabq5,RiffyDivine2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:38:36 2015 UTC,Does that apply to PC aswell?
modpiracy,3aabq5,Nickname863,5,Thu Jun 18 21:35:43 2015 UTC,"They didn't say that, and they were only talking about XBone at the time. I imagine anything uploaded to their hub will be screened the same way tho. As long as the Nexus is still useable it should be fine."
modpiracy,3aabq5,rocktheprovince,2,Thu Jun 18 21:44:21 2015 UTC,Only if you go through their mod network.  Which will be beyond easy to circumvent on PC for anyone with even a modicum of competence at modding.
modpiracy,3aabq5,Whytesmoke,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:54:09 2015 UTC,"Good chance that consoles will be limited to esm/esp only mods. Script extender is extremely unlikely to come to consoles. Though it would be pretty cool, I can't see Microsoft or Sony letting a third party exe run and inject code."
modpiracy,3aabq5,Seerix,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:48:20 2015 UTC,"I really doubt that a script extender is going to show up on consoles, if only for the fact that it's running fairly arbitrary code while an esp or esm really can't do much outside of the game. That being said, if Bethesda's really trying to push mods, they could implement features that people would want from a script extender into the game itself."

Irony because those words were uttered when the community got pissed at the 'Microtransactions' and dodgy plans that got leaked - and then, enough people cancelled their recurring subscriptions (and stopped buying prepaid, ingame tradeable Play Time, aka PLEX) that they had to fire 150 employees (the newest subsidary, Atlanta, USA, basically)."

modpiracy,3aabq5,RiffyDivine2,2,Thu Jun 18 18:47:17 2015 UTC,Never ever... EVER let companies off the hook.  They're not just people with feelings.  Their goal is to maximize money and the trend in the gaming industry has JUSTIFIED the salt and the suspicion and the doubt and the not letting them off the hook even a little bit.  I don't care if they come forward to the gamers totally honest and open and are totally dude bros for the rest of time.  The companies are NOT gamers.  Never give them the leeway you might give to some individual person.
modpiracy,3aabq5,kontankarite,4,Fri Jun 19 00:36:02 2015 UTC,"""Currently""  and a straight answer of ""No""  are two different things.  They are going to wait for release, as people can still get refunds.  There are so many pre order idiots, that the game is sold out currently for console gamers.   They aren't going to introduce them until people are unable to refund the game. They probably already made millions with pre orders. They aren't going to risk losing that money."

They know full well how long paid mods were up and it wasn't 24 fucking hours.   All the interview does is make me even more sure they are going to pull some bullshit.

modpiracy,3aabq5,dragontology,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:23:51 2015 UTC,I see them bringing a limited number of mods to the xbox. They can have every intention to bring all mods to the Xbone but if they open that avenue there will be more bricked xbones than working ones. Microsoft/Bethesda will vet some mods to make sure they work nicely on the platform and don't have load order/compatibility/stability problems. Then tack on a fee to make it worth their while. I don't think (hope) they will never try to bring paid mods to the PC because I think they know how that community will react.
modpiracy,3aabq5,freedomna,0,Thu Jun 18 19:52:27 2015 UTC,How do you know Todd Howard is lying?   His mouth is open.
modpiracy,3aabq5,kontankarite,0,Thu Jun 18 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"Well, considering the guy came out and talked about how he went all gaga over the iPhone in 2007, and then when smartphones started coming out a couple years later, nary a twitch, and he's still using an iPhone... he ain't exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. Is he next going to say the game's coming to the Wii? Or that he uses Windows 95? (Or maybe Mac OS System 7?) He isn't exactly at the forefront of technology. And that's cool, not everyone has to be. But who knows, maybe he's behind on this, too.  I don't agree with paid mods for all the good reasons, i.e. the reasons the talking heads don't want to talk about because it makes the system look bad. Like how if paid mods happen, modders are less likely to share exploits in the engine, so instead of modders agreeing to use the best exploit... they all use different ones, and the incompatibilities between mods rises exponentially. But no ‚Äî we're all a bunch of freeloading chumps and it really is as simple as that, more after a word from our sponsors. For fuck's sake.  That said, I think it's fucking awesome they're bringing mods to the Xbox One, and possibly PS4. It's a different scene. With Skyrim, modders exploited the shit out of the Creation engine. Now with Fallout 4, Bethesda is going to work with modders, and they're going to help these modders get the most out of the engine. So now if they want to monetize this new system, and they're working with some good talent... then my position gets undermined, and I can kind of get behind it.  Now, I know what you're thinking, but what if some of the best mods, and I mean the ones that everyone wants to use ‚Äî Unofficial patches, Arthmoor's work (Open cities, Cutting room floor, some smithing and arrow stuff, more), SkyUI, maybe Frostfall ‚Äî were getting updated regularly, and they just worked, like the DLC? What if, like, after a year, you could get this patch that makes Fallout 4 better? You don't think of it as a mod, you think of it as DLC that Bethesda made with some of the biggest modders on board.  I dunno. I'm just willing to keep an open mind. I'm also more willing to play a game straight up vanilla than most people. I've been playing Skyrim on the Xbox, and really, the biggest bother is the load screens. I can play it on the PC, and I can play it at 1080p60 (and above, I've hit 90), but hey, I'm going for 100% achievements, an honor I have with all the other Bethesda games. If nothing else, not one dirty red cent of mine has gone to the Summer Sale on Steam. Mostly because I'm focusing on my backlog... and I'm calling that $120 Pip-boy edition the rest of my gaming budget for the year, and I'm okay with that."

EA knows whenever they DLCfy their game that people are going to neg review them and rant and rave, the thing is: the ration of people who buy it compared to those who rant/rave about it are in acceptable levels, which is why EA continues to do their thing. Same with any other publisher. What we need to do is put the ratio in our favour."

If we do not buy the game, and say the reason why we are not buying the game is because of paid mods, then they will not think that FO4 is a bad game, but they will know (they do not have to understand why though) we prefer a zero tolerance stance on paid mods more than we want FO4. They will then take the appropriate action (compromise, full removal of paid mods). Of course this relies on the ratio I mentioned earlier being in our favour.

Then and only then I will pay for the game. I paid for all of bethesda's games and played them for over 100+ hours and then since the mod monetization.     Now I know it sucks, Fallout 4 is hyped to the max, but we need to stand our ground and make publishers know that ""Paid Mods"" is as bad of word as ""Always Online DRM"", the moment we give ground, we loose.

modpiracy,39xqqz,RiffyDivine2,2,Tue Jun 16 06:11:29 2015 UTC,Course they can.  Look at the TW games and how they're progressively locking out mods.  We've been promised full access but it'll be after they squeeze every drop out of the paid dlc
modpiracy,39xqqz,feralkitsune,2,Tue Jun 16 13:00:02 2015 UTC,TW? The fallout modding community is huge and is totally against paid mods. I don't see how they could lock mods to a certain platform like steam workshop without developing them from the ground up to include some sort of DRM. And at that point they're more dlc than mods.
modpiracy,39xqqz,feralkitsune,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:20:32 2015 UTC,"Total war. The last two iterations have made ""map mods"" undoable for example.  This is baked into the engine. So total conversions like the Lord of the rings or game of thrones mods can't be done yet."

Not to say if this does happen that someone won't work out a way to make it happen.  Now keep in mind my thoughts on this mostly require you to wear a tinfoil hat well talking about them.

modpiracy,39xqqz,ProfessorMordred,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:46:20 2015 UTC,You're probably right. I might have to put on my pirate hat and go for a sail if Bethesda does fuck up modding.

modpiracy,39vqcl,RiffyDivine2,7,Mon Jun 15 13:42:05 2015 UTC,Correct and that is my line of thinking already. You can be assured that if paid mods are a thing that they have worked out how to force you to pay for them.
modpiracy,39vqcl,DocNitro,2,Mon Jun 15 14:52:44 2015 UTC,"Well, a way to do it would be: CD Key used during Registration/Installation of the game. No playing without the key being 'used up' and thus invalidated.  When you DL a mod from the server, you ONLY get an archive that includes: Meshes, Textures, Sounds, Scripts (basically, everything that can, right now, be crammed into a BSA file) - just that it would be encrypted. The key for this encryption would be generated out of the CD Key, so that every downloaded mod would be, once 'delivered', bound to the game and not easily accessible.  Then, when you fire the game up, the ESP/ESM would not be installed locally at all, but loaded from the Beth Servers - and integrated into the running game as you play it.  Ding - DRM on mods, and modding outside of the 'Workshop' gone."

modpiracy,39vqcl,Kraosdada,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:13:17 2015 UTC,"Good theory, except for one thing. Bethesda DESPISES DRM! Fallout 3 only had DRM because the publisher forced them to put it in, and they removed it some time later.  Egosoft is a similar company that hates DRM and removes it from their games at the first chance.  CD Projekt RED Hate DRM because of Infogrames/Atari, who forced them to put TAGES on The Witcher 1, Once Atari dropped the game, RED said Never Again and removed TAGES from the game once and for all, and created GoG so no more games had to suffer from that horror."
modpiracy,39vqcl,DocNitro,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:47:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, GoG existed for some time before that. CDPR purchased it completely, however.  And Bethesda is owned by Zenimax (basically, Bethesda, as we refer to it, is the Game Studio, Zenimax is the company with the 'suits' that actually make decisions).  And keep in mind that people think of Steam as an 'online store' for videogames, plus a convenient management system - without realizing (or being in denial about) what it really is: DRM at its finest."

modpiracy,39vqcl,poopnuts,11,Mon Jun 15 05:17:34 2015 UTC,No. The entire mod is downloaded to your hard drive. There's no streaming with Skyrim mods.

I can understand being a fan of the subject and material of the games and the way they play, but like you said bug ridden messes on release day.  I won't even entertain the idea of getting a Bethesda game until way later, definitely on my patient game list permanently.  I want to see how this whole ecosystem with paid mods incorporated into their future games is going to be setup, I don't have a lot of confidence in it right now."

Just wait till it releases and they see the bug ridden mess that happens with every bethesda release thanks to gambryo engine. I just hope that if paid mods come back, we see the same size backlash as we did before. I get the feeling it wont be that big though, companies like this pay tuns of assholes to manage PR and I bet they have a plan to circumvent another uprising against potential sales."
modpiracy,39vqcl,RiffyDivine2,3,Mon Jun 15 18:45:02 2015 UTC,"Sadly this doesn't help in the least, the number of copies they have sold since it popped up on steam is more then enough.

Again this is all very tinfoil hat thinking so think of me more as the worse case and not what would happen as my plan costs money.

Have they no concept of the scale of these things?  How can a console EVER hope to run mods like PC?

If they can get people to accept that you need to pay for mods from the start then you will see people accept it as normal. It's just about learning how to play people to do what you want and it's easy when you got something they want.   The thing is that a little time has passed, they have offered up a new game people want so everything is forgotten and forgiven. We saw paid mods once so seeing it a second time lessens the response you will get from people. Each time it comes up there will be less and less of a fight till people accept it, it's all just a thought out plan to get what you want from people."

I'll get that shit on a fucking deep discount a year from now.  I don't know what bugs me more.  The inherent shit show of paid modding or the fact that if it's going to be crossplatform with garbage hardware, this means that modding itself is going to be pretty limited.  I've seen the god damned gameplay video.  This game already needs a texture overhaul and probably an ENB to compensate the glaring obvious short comings of their lighting.  How will these things going to be things if modding is going to be hinging on fucking consoles?  My modded Skyrim would make a PS4 go nuclear.  God fucking damnit!  Bethesda, I saw this fucking shit coming.  I fucking saw it fucking coming.  And it sounds like it's happening EXACTLY how I thought it would.  Fuck you Bethesda.

The only way modding is possible for consoles is if modding is limited by the capacity of a console.  This basically strips about 90% of what modding is all about.

There will be mod piracy if they decide to sell mods, no denying that. Someone will no doubt figure out how to sniff download links from Bethesda's server. You can do it on the PS3's store using Charles and installing it via a custom firmware and get free DLC (as long as you find a license - which isn't hard).  Limited modding? Oh please. The PC's always had amazing modding support and this will be no different. Yes, the Xbone will get mods (notice via a Bethesda site and not the workshop?) but the PC will always have the Workshop and Nexus to give us better mods than anything Bethesda's site can do (after all, in order to allow mods to be used on multiple platforms - they'll have to give strict guidelines for mods which a lot of modders will despise) so they'll use sites like the Nexus, meaning PCs will have DLC which can only be used on a PC."

Offering it like this will make a lot more people open to the idea and cause less backlash. Plus using a new game they know will sell as cover for the whole thing promises success for them, it's a good plan overall to get what they want. All they need now is to code the mods to the user and force you to be online to play the game so it can check mods and your account when you turn it on.   There is no way in hell Beth is going to let the kind of free money they can make from mods to slip away. Now all they did was cut steam out of it and odds are will keep a bigger slice and not just a 50/50.

According to him, they didn't take a mod and turn it into a DLC, rather the publisher of the actual board game wanted the mod taken down and then they went from there. Read the comment yourself here and form an opinion. I could be reading it wrong of course but I read it as Darin Ross was/is the publisher of the game that is now a DLC and wanted the original mod removed.  Of course he has the right to ask it to be removed, as it was iirc using copyrighted content without permission, but this is the kind of thing that happens when in game editor/tools are provided and a line need to be drawn and said with clarity ""This is ok and This is not. ""  This actually brings up a good point for the subreddit imo though. The rules state ""mods that are or have been confirmed to soon be behind a paywall"". The mod existed for the content yes, however technically the mod was breaking copyright and shouldn't have been on the steam workshop at all. Are we allowing this to be spread/exist on the subreddit because it was taken down? Or because people don't want to pay the money for legally owned content? Because so far it seems more of the latter. ""Oh, a mod was taken down and put up as DLC, even though the mod was breaking copyright and shouldn't have been up in the first place.

modpiracy,38y7tw,HomerSimpsonXronize,3,Mon Jun 8 15:19:43 2015 UTC,You can't really argue the copyright rule though since tons of mods of tons of games break it and if they became paid/abandoned we would still allow them to get posted here.  The only reason we left the posts up about TTS is because we didn't know the full story. Any future posts about this will be removed unless it is completely relevant.  And no we won't allow the paid DLC to be posted here however we will still allow for the free one to be posted since it is a abandoned mod.

For example people made a Warhammer Quest thing for tabletop simulator. If Games Workshop, the company that made and owns the right to Warhammer, were to get word of this they'd be suing the shit out of the devs. The fact is this game can have a very real impact in the sales of board games and such so mods for it are probably going to get subjected to this either by the dev or in courts when they get sued."

Not sure why everyone is bent out of shape about the DLC, it is a game they can't release for free as it is copyright protected, they worked with a publisher to get that game into their game engine for players to play with.  If you don't like the price, I get that, but it isn't like the devs did anything terrible that I can see. They gave people a legal option to play the game online.

modpiracy,38qi9h,FacialMondays,14,Fri Jun 5 23:34:18 2015 UTC,I'm confused. This doesn't seem like a mod it seems like DLC.
modpiracy,38qi9h,Twelveinchdragon,2,Sat Jun 6 05:14:35 2015 UTC,It was on the Workshop for free until they decided to turn it paid to play and sell it as a DLC. Tons of free Workshop mods are going to be slapped with DMCA's and be taken down if this catches on. They're literally taking mods from the Workshop and putting them behind a paywall selling them as DLCs for the game.
modpiracy,38qi9h,kimikodesu,27,Sat Jun 6 05:29:29 2015 UTC,"I am sorry, but you are misinformed. A community member put it on the Steam Workshop and the original creator Darin Ross asked to have them removed. We then started working with Skybound (the publisher) to have Superfight on as DLC.  DLC in Tabletop Simulator is NOT the same as paid mods. We are not taking fan made games and turning them into paid mods. We are working with legitimate publishers to get well-known and fun games legally into Tabletop Simulator. It's a lot of work and there are legal issues involved, thus it takes time to get DLC online. This is what a lot of people were asking for. We are not interested in having paid mods.  This is also a learning process for us and we're using this first DLC as a test for the future.  Thank you.  [edit] I'd also like to mention that even though the cards may seem just like ""jpegs"" to some people, we instill the items differently and permanently into the game than you would if you were creating a mod. This is why all the cards load very quickly."
modpiracy,38qi9h,Battlesmit,4,Sat Jun 6 07:17:52 2015 UTC,"Hello, I'd like to say that i've been eyeing TTS for some time but the lack of people to play with has been a bit of a stopping point. Does your game have any kind of Steam Integration or a match browser/way to find others to play?   Sorry about your game ending up as a post on this subreddit through misinformation though, even though i'm not OP. Hopefully you can understand with the whole shit steam went through that the users here are very...weary of mods being restricted/taken down. Especially with a game based around the whole aspect of being able to create your own card games and share them with others easily and openly."
modpiracy,38qi9h,kimikodesu,7,Sat Jun 6 12:28:22 2015 UTC,"I totally understand. I just wanted to differentiate between the DLC and paid mods. And we value our community's opinion and as a two person team, we are very open to make any changes. So this is something the two of us are discussing and will be discussing with the publisher as well and see what we can come up with.  As far as your question, there is an in-game IRC lobby so that you can find someone to play with. Otherwise, there is a server browser so you can find and join any public game. Admittedly, most servers are locked because people usually already have groups formed to play, but there's always a handful or two of servers that are always open. And you can also host a server and wait for people to join as well. There's also a very active Steam group and there's always people in their group chat readily available to play."

Care to share? All but one of those things is a lie. I hope you don't believe yourself, and this is just some really big troll attempt. Let me break it down.   Steam DRM   This does nothing to stop free mods.   Workshop DMCA notices   Only legitimate reason a free mod is removed, and that is because it is a game that is copyright protected.   Devs enforcing the rule   They haven't enforced anything. You can play any mod you like in the game.   Devs no longer supporting DRM-Free versions of the game   6 people own it. They have stated they will continue at some point, but they offered refunds or Steam keys to those 6 people in the meantime.   Third-Party DLC DRM   Doesn't exist. Lie.   Upcoming Microtransactions update   No such thing. More lies. Unless you're trying to say DLC is micro-transactions, but I would argue it isn't they aren't 99 cent cosmetic changes.   Blacklisting outside files from being loaded into the game   What? That doesn't happen. More lies.   etc. etc. etc.   Which is what? More shit you're making up?   literally what is stopping people from just making a free addon version of this?   That real answer is just DMCA notices, if you choose to make a copyrighted game. Steam handles those notices, and just removes the game from the Workshop, or bans you for a short term if you've uploaded multiple copies of protected games."

I know it is in conflict with Mojang's TC, and I condemn that, but that does not mean it's wrong, and frankly, this is the wrong sub to care about legal issues.    Skyrim had paid mods that enhanced the user's game. Minecraft, Garry's Mod, and many others have paid plug-ins that enhance a host's server, thereby enhancing his service and his potential to make a profit.      One is for personal use, the other is for public use that can be used to earn money.    Again, big difference. Your comparison does not work."
modpiracy,38o34j,_XVoidX_,6,Fri Jun 5 18:24:00 2015 UTC,Plugins and mods are effectively the same thing. The difference in wording exist purely to define them under separate contexts (plugins being for API's). They are both still third-party software that modify the game in some way.  It is undeniable that plugins are mods. And the distinction that it's okay for them to be priced because they're for servers and not clients leaves a desired explanation of reason.

modpiracy,38lfm1,ExDante,0,Fri Jun 5 11:23:02 2015 UTC,I am just giving up on him. Check his Twitter he is a little insane looking. He also only talks about politicians. He is just a fucking nut job I can even troll him because he is fucking so sure of himself
modpiracy,38lfm1,ExDante,0,Fri Jun 5 11:20:34 2015 UTC,"Hahaha   NewsIconGamers are perhaps the most ignorant group when it comes to new internet laws, not only do many believe no laws affect them. They act in a way that says they do not believe they will ever be caught, whilst posting the evidence needed for a conviction where anybody can see it. Many outright ignore the law and many Admins and Moderators do not even know what the local laws are so cannot even enforce them. Recently internet stalking and harassment laws have been modernised in most countries and many states, things are changing and the police are being trained in how to enforce these laws. Entirely new areas of law enforcement are appearing and arrests are starting to be made. Trolls cannot run around immuned to the law anymore, and the evidence posted so far of their past crimes is not going anywhere, it stays where they left it waiting to be used against them. To show you what sort of laws are appearing to help deal with online harassment, which has become a major problem for gamers these days. I have writen doc called ""Harassment/Cyberstalking Laws vs Gaming Sites & Services."" This doc explains which laws applies to which gaming site and explains how you can find out what laws apply to other sites so you can see whos actions are criminal and whos actions are simply bad manners or rude. Remember, website owners cannot opt out of laws they do not like, it does not matter how powerful they are, they have to obey local laws and deal with criminal behavior on their websites. So knowing the law that covers a site gives you the power to insist a moderate deals with trolls even if they are his friends.  Idiot doesn't know that he could get arrested for harssment as well? Does the fucking idiot not realize that or that police won't hunt us down for uploading a few shitty mods? Goddamn not only his he insane and a asshole he is fucking retarded. He just makes shit up to feel better. Because he is a man child. He doesn't even know what the hell he is talking about most the time:"
modpiracy,38lfm1,ExDante,-2,Fri Jun 5 17:56:01 2015 UTC,Idiot is where my edit starts and hahahha is where it begins. Usually how you start of thinking if giskard and how you think of him in the end as well. He is most likely the bane of he police since he calls him like a pussy over nothing. He is just a paranoid freaky dude who has no brain to him from all that weed. He is most likely in his parents basement or a dirt apartment eating chips and looking at you ww2 German toys on eBay. really he is not what we see him as. He isn't even that stupid he is not worth our time. The worst possible thoughts is he isn't worth what we give him. Let his website fail because he doesn't deserve it for the little work he did on his shitty mods.
modpiracy,38lfm1,ExDante,0,Fri Jun 5 17:58:22 2015 UTC,This guy is a nut job. No one likes him or reads what he rights thinking he is smart. No one stalks him he stalks us. We barley if not at all even visit his posts but he does this to us. HE breaks his own rules. If we get in trouble so is he and the idiot doesn't even know it
modpiracy,38lfm1,ExDante,0,Fri Jun 5 18:35:24 2015 UTC,He thinks nexus bans people because they still like him. When in truth they don't want to hear his name due to not liking him and being glad he is gone without the thought of the problems the retard caused back in fallout 3 days. Wow he really thinks nexus likes him. I love nexus and still download mods from their and they DO NOT like giskard. Before my first ban I saw mods talk bad about him and he thinks he is still liked. Fucking idiot
modpiracy,38lfm1,The_Scout1255,-1,Mon Jun 8 02:27:57 2015 UTC,Scout yours giskards bane so you know as well as me that he isn't as big as he thinks he is. He thinks he is still a part of the modding community but he is a man child playing kidder of in his land of blind idiots. And it will never change because something is wrong in his head so he doesn't understand. I will support you in anything scout but only when you want or need it not causing trolls attacks in general but if I know you scout you might have more than small troll things up your sleeve and for that I will support you.

My uploads come from the jerk troll modded giskard and him only since I respect nexus models but no giskard. Reason they banned his ass along time ago was because they though as I do
modpiracy,38lfm1,ExDante,0,Mon Jun 8 02:31:25 2015 UTC,Want to know what. Giskard go be a pedo and stop acting like a modder. You made one mod I like which you don't even let a great YouTuber spell wrong. You are a poor excuse for a fallout fan and modder. I just started modding and your mod has basic stuff I can already do better than. Ever wonder why we troll just you and your mods? Because we don't like YOU or respect YOU so leave and go back in your apartment smoke some more weed and pretend you are a king standing Over us alright? Because that is the closest thing to normal in you. And it is pretending to be something you want to be but never want to. I listen to music and think I am a space marine from war hammer. Your thoughts seems to go along that line yes?
modpiracy,38lfm1,ExDante,0,Mon Jun 8 03:01:35 2015 UTC,Btw giskard if it makes you shut the fuck up my ncr mod is not anywhere near based on your the ncr mod. I think pirating is different than taking credit so with my code of honor and join the ncr will be the same consept. Want to make that clear on this post since he seems to be on this post for now. I mod for fun and enjoyment but I won't people to enjoy mods with your fucked rules and make them better. So take your crappy mods back to your site and let lil ol me make the people here happy. Thanks for your effort at trying to push us to higer efforts of getting your mods but with my public mods we won't need such horrible mods to enjoy. XD unless you want skyrim shitty mods which I can't make. I am making a mod which fills the hunger people have for his mods so I need the knowledge although if anyone is willing to try to attempt his other mods than go ahead. But I am staying with his fallout mods. I will try to announce Saturday here since I like you all and I want you all to be the first to try out the giskard replacers :) again skyrim mods no go but I have the old mods if you want to see what he did but I wish you to make it from scratch. We are making his mods but better remember we are fixing the many wrongs he did not copying his mistakes  P.S I know giskard has other stuff to complain about but his mods won't be needed much longer so he should stay back in his blind follower fourms

No. If you are going  Post about someone that makes people mad like giskard you are always going to get someone like me who is a little to mad. Post about modding and you don't take the risk of someone like me who hates giskard.

I don't do this anymore just for fun I will have my revenge against the man child and his betrayal I will not think ever again I am the troll since he is. I made a promise man to man and he will after like s child and like s child he will have to learn too respect good honest modders in place of parents

modpiracy,38cjjb,commentsomehow,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:47:00 2015 UTC,"North American video game crash of 1983:       The video game crash of 1983, also known as Atari shock in Japan,  was a massive recession of the video game industry that occurred from 1983 to 1985. Revenues had peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983,  then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash was a serious event that brought an abrupt end to what is considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America.  The crash almost destroyed the then-booming industry and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles in the region, including the fastest-growing U.S. company in history at that point, Atari.  It lasted about two years, and many business analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles. The North American video game Console industry recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), which was soft launched in New York City in late 1985 and had become extremely popular in North America by 1987.   There were several reasons for the crash, but the main cause was saturation of the market. The full effects of the industry crash would not be felt until 1985.

modpiracy,3883le,Metal-Phoenix,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:39:06 2015 UTC,"then get on it?  you don't seem to understand how the gaming scene works, there are two elements to it, the people who care about getting releases out fast, who won't bother with a hard release, and then the people who actually care about the specific game they're cracking, who spend the time necessary to do so.  A good example of the latter are people who do MMO emulation, those projects span over many years and are often never fully done, because they take so long to do.  There are a few nearly complete ones though for some older games now."
modpiracy,3883le,AyeSiwmae,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:52:53 2015 UTC,"the scene cracks almost all of the games released on steam they don't care about the game, the scene can not crack this DRM. the 3DM emulator only works on certain hardware which means it's not proper, therefore the scene does not see it as a crack. also a lot of the games no one gives two fucks about get day 1 cracks."
modpiracy,3883le,Metal-Phoenix,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:06:06 2015 UTC,"The way you talk about the scene makes it painfully obvious you know nothing about the scene.  The only thing you're kind of right about is that they don't usually care about the games they crack, but that's not completely true either.  A lot of 0day content is using existing extraction techniques, similar to the way TV/blu-ray releases are.  In fact, most scene groups don't even create their own methods, they just use existing ones."

modpiracy,3883le,Metal-Phoenix,0,Tue Jun 2 22:12:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on the type of DRM, some are so simple they just create a stripping program, which will work on anything that has that type of DRM applied, while others are more complex and there will be a method guide on how to remove them.  I'm pretty sure if you google a specific enough search you should be able to find at the very least the common methods, if not, and you're genuinely interested, find a scene gaming channel in IRC or contact a group; if you have some coding background I'm sure they'd be interested and they are usually more than willing to teach methods."

modpiracy,3883le,HomerSimpsonXronize,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:57:05 2015 UTC,"If you purchased a license to the game, (Let's not kid ourselves, data can't be owned, neither by the ""buyer"" or ""the author""), then you should be allowed to do whatever you want with it.    The idea on relying on a closed piece of software, to break the protection of another closed piece of software, is kinda too risky for me. Not because of the virus part so much as the ""you can't update and won't know when it won't work anoymore"" part.    It's not convenient enough, to me.    The real thing people don't want to admit, well, most ""IP"" content producer don't want to admit, is that making software is a service. You aren't producing a tangible good, you are just arranging bits in a sequence, for someone else. You can't own an arrangement of bits. Your ""product"" isn't much more than how a floral arrangement looks when a florist go through it, you don't even grow the flowers, you arrange them.    And I say this, as an actual professional software developer with 10 years of experience, who works for a huge corp. Not one of those ""I started something in my garage last summer and never sold anything, but we are incorporated, so that makes me a professional so I know everything about software and IP."""
modpiracy,3883le,HomerSimpsonXronize,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:02:40 2015 UTC,"I've been doing software development in one form or another for a reasonable number of years This question of whether software is a service or a product can be argued so many different ways that I think we can get mired down in it and not really make headway on anything. It is it's own topic too large in scope to really be of reasonable use to this particular discussion, I think.   To me, if I paid money for it and can put it on something physical, then it should fall under all over things that you can trade money for: opening voids any service or support warranty.   Software is unique in that:    For any product I have, I can open it up and there's not much anyone can do about it. If I get it home, plug it in and blows up, I have legal recourse. If I have someone coming to do something for me (service), I can have them do anything within the range of their services and I can watch them to learn how to do it myself. I can even hire them to go a little outside of those service ranges in many circumstances. If that person goes to cut down a tree and it crushes my house, I have legal recourse. Software? Nope, it's illegal to learn how it works (because you have to in some measure reverse engineer it), you can't use it for things it's not intended, and you can't even come back to the maker if it blows up your house. You can't (legally) get into it, change how it works, extract data from it. You can't do anything. Software is it's own thing there.    That said, if I feel that the restrictions are ethically unreasonable, I'll act according to how I feel it's ethical to act. For example, Track Mania (at least used to) use StarForce DRM. This had the unfortunate side affect of destroying your CD drives. Does the company have an ethical reason to protect it's software? You bet. Do I have to let them destroy my hardware to enjoy it? Not gonna happen.   I may be a developer but I am a consumer. If I didn't need to be a consumer, I wouldn't think about it so much but being a consumer costs me resources and I have to make ethical decisions based on that."
modpiracy,3883le,HomerSimpsonXronize,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:01:10 2015 UTC,"I feel that the restrictions are ethically unreasonable   That's because copyright isn't a natural right.

I'm sure they're gonna pull off another Skyrim, aka sell on hype preorders and put zero effort into the product."
modpiracy,3883le,HomerSimpsonXronize,3,Tue Jun 2 18:53:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's a tired comment for you or this sub, but Skyrim was made first and foremost for consoles. It was only the high res ""dlc"" that it even came close to being worth a second look texture-wise. Oblivion could be modded so heavily that it's graphics put anything modded Skyrim can do to shame."
modpiracy,3883le,kontankarite,0,Tue Jun 2 22:58:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is you assume the biggest problem for me was the bad graphics. I honestly don't care for graphics that much, and they're kinda justified when you consider it was a console port, but what I hated about Skyrim the most was the story, gameplay, that kinda thing. For being an AAA title, the actual combat system was/is terribad, and the story/quests come off as unfinished, at most, and being a console port doesn't justify the story and combat system being bad, only the graphics. EVERYTHING about Skyrim without mods was terrible, the graphics and menus is only a small part of that."
modpiracy,3883le,snarfies,0,Wed Jun 3 12:53:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I can agree on all of those points although for me the modeling system/graphics should have been of a higher caliber. The story? Eh, I can take it or wish it were better. I am not beyond filling in with my imagination although the civil war bit is sorely lacking. Also, this idea that there's these cities but they're pretty much empty. Combat was... acceptable to a point. Block, bash, attack, power attack. They skimped a lot on the magic and archery bit though. Magic is essentially useless and for having a whole skimpy ""college"" devoted to it, that doesn't make sense. I can one hit many things with a weapon that I can't with magic. So combat, overall, is unbalanced. There's undead, falmer, robots, and people. A few animals. ""Dragons"" are woefully underpowered and there's far too little attention to detail. So perhaps I should have called it ""immersion factor."" There are regular NES games with far better immersion capability than Skyrim and that's sad."

It's so easy to temporarily hide your IP nowadays, not from the government or from a private investigator, but from some dumb fuck running a forums it's simple. Even if he does get your real IP, what is he going to do with it? Dispatch a SWAT team to your house for trolling? Spread it around like it's some great secret?   Oh well, he'll learn eventually.

modpiracy,36se4l,MosAnted,2,Sat May 23 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to choose textures when there are no screenshots. However, since most of these are small random things I installed all the ones that I didn't already have, and I'll take some screenshots as I find them, assuming people want them. So far, since I was in the Reach, I found the reachgrassobject and the Hanging Moss.  The reach grass object (not the reach grass, which is the ground texture), the darker of the grasses seen in my screenshot, clashes a bit with the reach grass ground texture that I already have. I suppose it's more balanced for use with the ground texture included in the pack. I'm not sure I'll be keeping this one.  The hanging moss seems nice enough, but at my normal FOV of 100 I couldn't really notice it was different. The screenshots are taken at FOV 35. If anything you can get REALLY close to it and still have it look good. It'd probably work well as a foreground blurred object for screenshots.  imgur converted the screenshots to jpg. They were supposed to be pngs. Oh well, I probably had to tell it not to."

A few people might know about this rogue site, but most people don't. Who's the target audience? I know there's Lover's Lab for pornographic (and possibly other) mods, and there's GEMS, but isn't everyone going to the Nexus (and possibly the shitpool that is the Steam Workshop ‚Äî and it was before the paid mods thing, it was never a joy to use, at least IMO)?  I mean, the only law I've really seen on the Nexus is, no child porn. Literally every child mod references it and swears up and down they're not doing it. Which I find fucking hilarious because in vanilla Hearthfire, if you give a child a new outfit, they'll strip to briefs (boys) or training bra and panties (girls) for a split second before putting on the new outfit. (Or maybe it was just my old computer not making the switch fast enough. I really hope that's the case.) But no, Nexus doesn't allow mods where children can appear nude and/or perform sexual acts. I'm 100% okay with this, especially since I use a few child mods (multiple adoption, child overhaul... maybe another one) and while I want them improved, I don't want any of that in my game.  Shit, I don't even want nude adults in my game. It's a game, not a fucking porno.  But yeah, is this Russian site allowing child porn mods or something? Is that their thing? Is that what's bringing people in, that is making the prospect of taking credit for other peoples' mods a thing?"

modpiracy,368a9s,Konork,30,Sun May 17 03:36:05 2015 UTC,"Do you happen to know why he legitimately seems to believe that mod cleaning is a bad thing that leads to instability?   Yes, he used to mod Oblivion back in the day. He made a mod called the Cyrodiil Upgrade Overhaul. Basically changed all the leveled lists and such things. Great mod. Conflicted though with other mods of its type such as OOO. If I recall, cleaning his mod though fixed the issue. He didn't like that people though came to the conclusion by touching 'his' work. I remember he also had an argument that all sorts of bad things happen if you cleaned the vanilla Oblivion files.  At one point, he quit Oblivion modding all together. He eventually gave his blessing to a group called ""Dragon Captions"" to work on it, and they did. A modder with Dragon Captions named Onra then cleaned his famous Kvatch Aftermath mod. He didn't like that as it was against what he thought was right.  Giskard knows generally how to make mods and he sure does have a lot of perseverance in making them, but in terms of the technical backend, I am almost 100% confident in saying he has no idea how the data is loaded and stored."

Honestly though, as a disclaimer, I am actually in favor of modders being able to ask for patronage for their work. A TL;DR of my opinion is that the system employed by Valve and Bethesda sucked because modders hardly got a cut.   I'm fine with how Nexus does their thing with donations, but as a software developer I am a little bias when it comes to paying for software."
modpiracy,368a9s,Lord_Jeebus,13,Sun May 17 23:03:44 2015 UTC,"I actually find something far more preferable such as commissioning modders to make a very specific mod and them getting paid for that plus Bethesda actually hiring some of these modders as crack teams for making third party unofficial DLC, but give them even more access to the nuts and bolts of the game.  Let them be actual developers on huge sanctioned projects while modding in a general sense stays free."
modpiracy,368a9s,shibaizutsu,5,Sun May 17 23:07:00 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really cool idea that I had never even thought of.  I'm just of the thought that if people are producing a mod with the intention of making money off of it, they should be able to do so. What Valve and Bethesda did on the other hand, was a blatant money grab. They tried to profit off of the work of other modders when they really shouldn't."
modpiracy,368a9s,Lord_Jeebus,6,Sun May 17 23:10:38 2015 UTC,"I don't exactly agree with your sentiment.  But that's probably because we both have conflicting beliefs on what money does.  I personally do not agree that money in and of itself necessitates that excellence will happen because it'd be far more efficient to make the things that make quick money instead of actually knuckling down and making something worthwhile.  I just think making modding paid for just because would simply flood that new market with junk to people not choosy enough to really consider what's worth paying for or not.  For what it's worth, those for sale mods actually did sell but I don't think not ONE OF THEM was impressive enough to pay for.  I know there's a lot of people out there that vehemently believe that introducing money into the mod community would absolutely mean that more times than not, only good worthy mods would be made.  But what do I really know?  It made 10 Gs overall so if that's really what people want, more power to them.  I'm also not exactly AGAINST Beth and Valve taking a cut, but this is just me being lawful evil.  I agree with the sentiment that they shouldn't get a cut, but I'm kinda sour grapes about paid modding and if we're gonna monetize modding, then let's get nice and corporate about it."

Not holding any grudges or any negative connotations against you but I can't imagine how you could deal with him when he treats all his fans who seem to unconditionally love him on his private forum like garbage.
modpiracy,368a9s,The_Scout1255,11,Sun May 17 04:11:35 2015 UTC,"I was one of those fans at one point. I'll readily admit that. I had the wool pulled over my eyes. I was younger mentally too then.  It was a progressive thing, he wasn't always this off the deep end too. A brief history lesson:  He started with a website called Mechstorm, or something like that. I was a member at mechstorm. I did some modding with Dragon Captions back then. DC was also on that forum. He closed Mechstorm after someone trolled him on it. Shut the whole thing down and disappeared. One of the old Administrators on that site then assumes control of the mods. Giskard doesn't like that and throws a fit. Him and his stuff is then banned from Nexus.  I'm at this time still working with Dragon Captions. He eventually gives his blessing to Dragon Captions to work with his stuff. I really handled the Administrative things as his modding stuff was way over my teenage head in terms of technicalities. I did a good job keeping everyone happy in terms of support.  Giskard then goes koo koo again after something gets ""cleaned."" He leaves and makes his own site that originally didn't support Oblivion. It instead supported Fallout 3. I was still apart of the community and had friends in the community as well. Giskard decides he wants to bring Oblivion back, asks me to be the ""community manager."" Boom, I'm at my start at staff.  I do a good job and learned the forum software (IPB). Boom, made an Administrator. He later switched to Vbulletin, which I also knew the ins and outs of. I'm still at this point basically the person who keeps the forums all happy happy. I later resigned to focus my time on being an Moderator (and later Administrator) for a large Minecraft Community. About two months after I left, I was repromoted to keep an eye on things after he had a death in the family. I resigned again after about a month.  While I was busy running a Minecraft community, he didn't have me to keep him under control anymore. When I was an Administrator with him, the drama was kept to a minimum. The only thing that I can only think of is that he had this Spat with the People from Better Cities (for Oblivion). He made his own better city mods that were blatantly incompatible with their's. After I left, you had 100% Giskard uncensored. He would close registration on his forums, ban people like crazy; hell, as I mentioned in a previous post, he even banned me!  I haven't spoken to him since. Good riddance."
modpiracy,368a9s,pm_me_nekogirls,7,Sun May 17 04:34:17 2015 UTC,"Fair enough really, it happens to everyone who goes through the young and stupid phase during their life. You'd be hard pressed to find anyone who came out of their teenage phase without saying or doing anything dumb. I'm just glad all my stupid teenage nonsense happened without social media and was on various gaming forums that have since died/buried under the depths of time.  Sounds like you were the PR guy for him and for what it's worth it sounds like you did an excellent job because right now without anyone to keep him in check he's really going nuts throughout this whole episode. Even threatening to ban people who even slightly disagree with him in their posts whilst they walk on egg shells.  And another two questions if you wish to indulge me but what is with Giskard's aversion to third party modding tools like TES4/TES5Edit, Wyre Bash and the like? Is it simply the terminology that the tools employ i.e ""dirty"" or is it distrust for the tools as they're from the community that he perceives as being full of trolls?  Would you say that most of the posters at TEG are actually loyal posters who adore Giskard or would you say they're putting on an act for whatever reason i.e getting mods? Because I found myself thinking ""is this like the Truman Show, starring Giskard as Truman because I'm acting really nice to him so I get to the downloads?"" and wondered whether I was one of many or alone in my thoughts."
modpiracy,368a9s,Nickname863,9,Sun May 17 04:51:53 2015 UTC,"I mentioned his aversion for TES4EDIT and Wyre in a previous post. Yeah, I guess I was sort of a PR guy. From 2010-2013 he had the least amount of drama because I was there. I was more of the guy that was talking into his earpiece.  Basically, for that one mod (CUO), cleaning the mod so it could run with OOO (and this other mod that was OOO and two others that I can not recall the name of) made it so that the mod would not work as he wanted. He did not like the guy who made TES5 Edit if I recall as he had lots of clout on Bethesda's forums. They got into a disagreement, and the author had lots of defenders. So really its a combination of both the things you described.  He also had this view that the game would work if it were kept simple. Yeah, no shit. He did not however understand that in order to get lots of mods into the game, patches were needed. He blamed lots of problems on load order and patches.  Giskard's users also adore him. Arthmoor described them best as Zealots. I was once a Zealot. I'd seriously liken it to Scientology. Sure, his philosophy worked, but other ones do too! That and like the people behind Scientology he is abusive. I was never really scared of him, he even told me at one point that he liked that I would sometimes disagree with him in terms of his actions (as in he telling him not to go full nuclear like he is doing now). The people on the forum are Zealots! Sheep! Most of them anyway.  It's sad though, because I know a few people that still work with him that he abused like I had. They're addicted to it though (not the abuse, being his utility). They seemingly have a say! They seemingly have control! It's all honeymoon for a few months then BAM, one wrong step and your banned. He's known for banning voice actors (even loyal ones) if they hand in their lines late. He'll eventually unban them, they'll come back and repeat the cycle. Heartbreaking really."
modpiracy,368a9s,pm_me_nekogirls,7,Sun May 17 05:05:11 2015 UTC,what do you think about him posting my ip on his site
modpiracy,368a9s,pm_me_nekogirls,7,Mon May 18 22:05:26 2015 UTC,"Totally like him. Actually, he has a very odd obsession with IPs.  He has this particular belief that people are always spying on him or stalking him. When I was an administrator there, he installed analytics software on the site. He wanted to see everyone who visited, where they came from, where they lived, and where they were going. Thought he could root out the ""trolls"" that way. I highly suggest browsing his website with a VPN, because while he will cry about his privacy. Know that he is crying wolf; he IS WATCHING and LOGGING your every move!  I did not partake in that. It was all very too stalkerish; funny though because that was the exact same crime that he accused them of perpetrating on him.  The more and more I reflect on the things he wanted me to do there, the more and more I am happy that I left."

Like seven or eight years -- first on the forums, and then on Nexus. And judging on the few posts I've read from him, he's singing the same song he did back then. ""I'm the victim, you're all trolls, I'm calling the police"" and so on.   It's kinda sad. He's clearly got something going on. He's got this borderline idea that he's simultaneously the greatest mod in the community and the most victimized. The thing is: his mods were good. He's obviously got some skill, but his attitude is and always has been getting in the way of that.  It's too bad. He seems to be suffering from something, and I can feel some sympathy for him, but that's not an excuse to act like an ass. I guess the one good thing is that he's retreated to his own little corner of the internet where he can host his files his own way and dictate his user's opinions."

He understood how to get basic construction kit functions to work.  He always wrote horribly, stole song lyrics and nonsensical book references, and contradicted the lore while claiming he was an expert on it. He has written mods to the standard of early Oblivion modding and claims this is the correct way to do it. Anyone who cleans mods, or even has TES5Edit or LOOT installed, is a massive idiot in his eyes. If you ask any good intelligent modder about him, they'll tell you he's an embarrassment in a technical sense.

The author of it has abandoned the mod already, after barely finishing it. He officially stated that outside of a 'skimpy slutwear' set of conversions (Shoulderpads, helmet, gloves, boots, that's it), he is NOT going to ever do anything further. The default textures turn every male into a softfaced prettyboy, and you struggle to get ANY kind of 'rough' look onto them.  While there are certainly some 'third party' modders on LadyMoiraine that made 'proper' conversions and textures, so that you aren't ONLY having a Skyrim filled with twinks in 'bend me over the nearest rock' armor, the mod itself is already in the 'not going to get any improvements' stage, and Vector has, to my knowledge, not yet given permission to modify the core mod yet.  His previous work, Schlongs, is being modified. Slowly, but steady. It is just that the only current 'not already included' skin is the CMO Package which requires 'FemFeet Redone', that don't look very male to me.

Anybody who comes here having used the stolen mods will be banned and reported to their ISP. And yes I can tell.... the mod docs are not up todate but the forum mod descriptions on here are. So your not going to know stuff you should know if you did not get them legitimately.  The mods where stolen from the private download area of TEG and uploaded to mediafire on the 10th MAY after the thieves had planned the theft for 5 days on Reddit first and abused the 30 post system to do it. The group was originally set up to steal paid for mods from steam but when that ended, they targeted me and my private work.  Reddit had banned all those who reported the illegal activity and left the thieves to keep on planning the theft. The ring leaders where Scout, Renegade and DarkLord.  I spotted something wrong on 10th May and purged the last 10 days worth of accounts to stop their little game but it appears the theft had already taken place. I was just hours too late.   I have made effort since the Steam paid mods troll rampage to show you players the sort of crap us modders take in order to make mods for you. This is just 1 example of the none sense that forced me to quit supporting the Elder Scrolls community in 2008 and is why i went private in the first place.  Reddits position on those who reported illegal activities is EXACTLY the same as Bethesdas and Nexus was back in 2008, eg support the thieves and trolls, punish the victims and anybody else that hits the report button.   So this is in no way unusual for the Elder Scrolls community to behave this way and not really a surprise to me.  Because keeping the post count to access the download area as low as 30 proved to be too easily abused by thieves, the download area now unlocks at 100 posts and may go higher. Also since I was too late in stopping the theft I am now accepting new registrations again. No point keeping it locked down now.  TEG is up for renewal in August and it is going to cost me ¬£200 to keep TEG open so I can be flamed, robbed and hacked for another 3 years by members of the TES community. So if TEG disappears around then and you see a giant FUCK YOU message where my Oblivion, Skyrim and Fallout mods used to be. You know I have decided not to waste money on supporting gamers that behave this way."" lol he thinks reddit itself is to blame what a idiot"

Also, cleaning his mods wrecks them, you would have known this IF you had bothered to look at his youtube channel, enjoy your broken mods, idiots.  Finally, considering what I have seen of the Nexus forums and their admin's attitude towards other modders, what Giskard posted in http://www.theengineeringguild.co.uk/featured-stories/15-why-i-quit-the-elder-scrolls-modding-scene is very plausible.  Case in point, Thirteenoranges, the guy behind the factions mods, was banned because someone made an account called thirteenoranges1 and started breaking the rules, anyone can put a 1 after a name but to claim it was the same person based on that alone is RUBBISH, another mod-maker, the creator of the 9th cult of the moon mod, was also ostricized from the nexus for making a series of mods that used Fallout's gore engine to make a mod about a team of murderers JUST BECAUSE YOU USE A MINI-NUKE LAUNCHER IN RIVET CITY!!!  Maybe next time before you start calling someone a moralfag and an idiot, you will take a look at other modders on the same site and see what happened to them too...idiots.  Also, I don't believe that the porn site account belongs to him at all, in fact I suspect that someone else made that account for the sole purpose of framing him for it."

This would have ended the Skyrim modding community had even more big names come out.

This was not related to the NDA that the modders involved were under according to their statements etc.
modpiracy,34zadg,Jack_Hat,6,Thu May 7 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"This guy is full of crap and totally biased in his views.   There was notice. ~70 modders with various levels of community...   That is not notice to the general public. So a some modders know about it. How the heck do you consider that notice?   Nobody is being forced to do anything.   No one forced the mod creators to make their mods and release them free in the first place. They did that on their own, full well knowing they likely never would be paid for it.  So clearly at the time of development it wasn't about money.  If you really want to sell mods, make an entirely new mod, and put that up for sale. To many modders where selling free versions of their mods, which was stupid. Why am I going to pay for something that has always been free thus far? No, thanks. Do I with a new game, and new mods. Not with an already established community.   it's a small minority of very vocal people. The majority, as usual, is sitting silent.   Many people tend to use this argument as if it changes anything, when in reality it's just a fallacy. For all you know those silent people also agree with the vocal people. I think it's a bit strange that all the vocal people are against the idea and all the silent people are for the idea.  I do realize this is based on the idea that people who either don't care or don't have an issue, tend to not speak up because there is no reason to. This doesn't mean it can be used as some logical argument because there isn't a way to actually know a silent persons views on the matter. Also, in this case, anyone who uses the internet whom is a gamer knew about this. So, why on earth would they remain silent if they disagreed with the ""vocal minority."" Also, there are some vocal people who disagree, but they are so few and far between.   Uh, no, not quite. They don't ""own"" anything. Proof of that is in the kind of 1099-MISC we're going to get from the IRS.   Except you do give them tons of permissions. If you actually read their agreement, it pretty much says they can do whatever they want with your work. It's almost like co-ownership, but the mod author takes full responsibility. It's actually a pretty crap deal.   That said, I'm also not convinced that Fore had the legal standing to bar the dependency on FNIS to get the fishing animation into the game.   He is right on this point. Legally, as long as no one is using another persons work, then it is fine. It doesn't matter if an animation in his work is dependent on another mod, as long as that mod isn't included with his mod. However, morally speaking, I think it's best you not depend on other mods if you don't want to fracture your relationship with other modders.   lot of people have put forth donations as a way to combat what they see as the coming scourge. There's only one problem. Nobody donates. It could very well be that's because, until Friday, the donation buttons on Nexus may as well have been invisible. Thing is, everyone knew they existed and knew where to find them.    Notice words like ""nobody"" and ""everyone."" To say nobody donates is dishonest, and simply just inaccurate. The Skyrim community never really got involved in the donations process due to Bethesda's terms and services, as it has stated you are not allowed to make money off your mods. Many other games who actually allow making money off of mods have been successful with donations.  This is simply the only difference, the issue isn't that people don't donate, it's that Bethesda has not allowed it.  As for the donation button on Nexus, to say everyone knew it existed is also dishonest. Heck, even I didn't know it existed. Even if I did know it existed, I certainly wouldn't know where to find it. He also goes on to say that he places donation buttons elsewhere. So, these other places you placed them have just as much traffic as Nexus? No? Then placing a donation button in other places isn't going to help much.  Last but not least ...   [1] Over the last 2 days, incoming donations have exploded. I very much appreciate every last one of them, but I'm going to wait and see if this is a temporary trend or a long term thing before commenting further on this.    The fact he is receiving so many donations .. doesn't that speak for itself or does he think those donations are also coming from the vocal minority? Huh ... they seem pretty generous don't they."

modpiracy,34zadg,Kraosdada,4,Tue May 12 10:41:21 2015 UTC,"I think Expired (RaceMenu, EFF) was going to do it too but keep his mods free on the nexus at the same time.  I've lost a lot of respect for a lot of these modders. Willing to sell their mods so taht these companies can get a larger share they really don't need or deserve at all. Like, not even remotely. Valve maybe should get 5% for hosting and Bethsda like 1% for providing the platform. But even then, all of that is irrelevant because selling skyrim mods is stupid and wrong."
modpiracy,34zadg,Kraosdada,-2,Wed May 6 02:20:32 2015 UTC,"I'd be ok with paid modding IF we all knew it going in, I wouldn't like it, but I'd tolerate it. If Bethesda tries this again with FO4, and they announce it as a feature from the start then I'll accept that's just how its going to work.  But with Skyrim, your talking a game and modding community that are 5 years old, everyone made their choices based upon the fact that mods could not, and would not be sold. I'm not speaking just as an end user, what about asset authors who made their work free because they knew they couldn't make the big world changing mods, but they could make parts for them? What about all the frameworks that are required by hundreds of mods? What about the the mods that actually had their owners give them up and let others take over? Its fucking nuts. Bethesda and Valve didn't give a shit in the path of their money grab...and honestly nether did the modders who jumped on the path. I'm not going to say they were outright being greedy, but for various reason's some good, some bad, they threw away the good will of the community for a chance to make a pittance.  Edit: Maybe my favorite thing being said by supporters of paid mods is that the Authors should just quit making mods and become indie developers...because they didn't learn at all from Chesko's attempt and failure at doing just that, or that indie developers outside of a select few tend to make absolute jackshit and often go deep into debt trying to make games that sell far too few copies to ever break even. For every Bastion there are 500 shitty rogue likes that have sold 500 copies at $9.99 but cost $20,000 to produce."

At a bare minimum they could just add ""download w/nmm"" ""download with custom mod organizer"" features for the workshop items. That would solve a ton of issues."

However, the mod authors don't really deserve all the blame and harassment they're getting. Valve and Bethesda deserve that, especially Bethesda.  I still don't understand why people want to defend a system where mod authors can sell their mods. The second something is monetized, things take a turn for the worse -- 100% of the time, that happens. All the time.  We won't have hundreds of mods like Falskaar, all polished and with professional voice acting. We'll be lucky if we ever get those again. What we'll have are thousands of cosmetic mods -- poorly done cosmetic mods.  The models will be amazing. The textures will be amazing. The implementation, however? Horrible. One piece armor sets and horribly balanced weapons all around Riverwood.. and people will buy them. They'll buy them all day long, and for $1 each. That'll set a precedent. Why would you spend 12 hour days building a mod like Falskaar when you can whip up a $1 mod in 30 minutes and make far more money? You'll get far, far less complaints and have far more customers -- no one is going to care that a $1 mod lacks polish, but God help the mod author of a $30 mod that conflicts with 1 or 2 other mods in a playthrough with 100-200 mods that aren't sorted with LOOT or checked in TESVEdit.  And you'd be kidding yourself if you didn't expect Bethesda to be looking on, wondering why they're spending all their time making armor sets with multiple pieces when their customers are content with one piece sets. They could probably increase the graphical detail on their next game if they only had to render two-three objects per NPC.. And imagine the amount of time they'd save and money they'd earn if they didn't have to release DLC like Dragonborn or Dawnguard -- $10 armor and weapon packs are so much easier to develop, and apparently there's a massive market for them.  .. just bad, bad all around."

I want my donations to go to the people I believe deserve them, the ones who stood up for everyone and not just  themselves.  And yes, paid modding will quickly turn into shit mods being all there are for sale. When I consider what will be for sale I quickly realize it will be similar to what Oblivion's dlc's outside the big two were...but worse.

modpiracy,34ioky,HomerSimpsonXronize,7,Fri May 1 21:20:00 2015 UTC,No they don't. Valve would have the most to gain in the long run. Bethesda would gain it for that one game. But how many games would start using it?
modpiracy,34ioky,Laureolus,-1,Fri May 1 21:43:45 2015 UTC,"The Bethesda got the largest share.   The majority of developers already don't support modding because of the ""costs"" of doing so and believe that it impedes DLC sales. If they started supporting paid modding because of this, you'd have still lost nothing if you'd never pay for mods because they didn't exist anyway."
modpiracy,34ioky,HomerSimpsonXronize,8,Fri May 1 21:47:45 2015 UTC,You aren't looking at the big picture here at all.   Look at how many developers for games said paid modding for games is a good idea. Now imagine if all of them over the course of this year decided to add paid modding like Bethesda did with Skyrim. Valve will still be getting 30% and will be getting 30% of every mod in every game.
modpiracy,34ioky,Laureolus,0,Fri May 1 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"Ok? I get that.  I'm more inclined to believe that the person coding one of the most essential Skyrim mods feels like they deserve some compensation when asked, no bribery needed.  You have lost nothing if a developer that never supported modding goes paid modding."
modpiracy,34ioky,HomerSimpsonXronize,4,Fri May 1 21:58:50 2015 UTC,That isn't what I am saying at all. You are saying Bethesda choose this and it wasn't them. It was Valve.  I agree there probably isn't any bribery but that isn't what I was writing about.
modpiracy,34ioky,Laureolus,-1,Fri May 1 22:02:23 2015 UTC,"Bethesda did chose to do this. Valve can't sell Bethesda's stuff without permission. Valve didn't hold a gun to their head and say DO IT.  Bethesda looked at Valve's data, threw out the entire system Valve has that somewhat justifies their share, and tried to take the lion's share."
modpiracy,34ioky,HomerSimpsonXronize,3,Fri May 1 22:26:07 2015 UTC,What are you talking about... Valve threw them the idea and they accepted it. It wasn't Bethesda's idea.
modpiracy,34ioky,PleaseKneelBeforeZod,3,Fri May 1 22:41:13 2015 UTC,"It was Valve's idea and yes, Bethesda would stand to gain the most in this deal only. Of course Valve in the long run with more/more games adding paid modding support.. Valve would reap the biggest reward. Case closed."
modpiracy,34ioky,Mistress_Ahri,3,Sat May 2 04:08:05 2015 UTC,If it wasnt for mods i would have no interest in Skyrim. I never even looked at ESO because its not moddable. Bethesda would lose alot without mods.
modpiracy,34ioky,Laureolus,0,Fri May 1 22:52:34 2015 UTC,"Yes... but Bethesda has never wanted to remove modding?  I was referring to if paid modding took off and other developers, that never/currently don't do modding, did paid modding only.  For that case, nothing was ever lost. They view modding as unprofitable and wouldn't do free modding."
modpiracy,34ioky,PleaseKneelBeforeZod,2,Fri May 1 23:08:35 2015 UTC,"It depends on the company at hand man, something like Call of Duty of course will pick a DLC route over mod support.    Modding in the eyes of Bethesda is nothing but a good thing. It extends the period of time in which people still buy the game. Skyrim alone has made like what $1.4B and its still selling copies to this day mainly because of modding. Almost 4 years later, impressive lol."

And slowly, quietly, the gaming community will let it in.   Then, in a few years, it'll be as normal to us as today's ripoff DLC practices have become.

modpiracy,34ioky,RetroJester1,5,Sat May 2 07:37:33 2015 UTC,"User created content for money is a very good idea and actually works well on the right platform, like Second Life for example. but for a single player game like Skyrim, it's a stupid idea. Seriously. The people who did this are mind numblingly stupid. Putting mods behind a paywall? No no no.  In Second Life, the platform is bare bones and users have to create the world and the items and do what they want. There are shitty things and there are massively great things and users decide what to buy and what not to buy. People sell things for free, others over charge. It works because it was built for this. People can come into SL with money and buy digital stuff and services or they can come in with nothing and make real money. They can do both in fact, which many do.  But to think you can mix this concept with Skyrim in this way is silly.  How you do it is, gather teams of modders to work on exspansion packs. You (Bethsda and Valve) pay them yourselves and sell the product. You can have some people make weapons, some making armors, some making systems and optional UI changes, adding spells etc etc etc. Then quality check it and pack it all together. Thats the only way you can ever make usermade content sellable to a lot of people for a single player game. Paid mods can work better for online only games if they're kept at being cosmetic because it's the same as cosmetic DLC. You get to show off your characters wearing unique stuff. Games like Tomb Raider, DmC, the Batman games that actually sell skins that only you will see are stupid and people who buy the are stupid. You can literally just mod it it.  User created content is the holy grail of gaming. If you get users to make content for other users, you don't need developers to spend 6 months of work to produce 5 hours of content. Then you have a rating system. The problem is Valve thought they could get money from doing this. They need to fire the people who thought this was going sit well with Skyrim gamers.  Even with something like Second life, the company only takes 5% from sales made on the official SL market place and nothing on sales you make in the game. Then they take 3% off when you convert the ingame money to real life money. I'm a very very small time seller. No where near the top dogs who make a living. I've made at least $15,000 to $18,000 USD over the last 8 years. That's nice pocket change. Just imagine making $15,000 and only being able to get less than 4,000 of that."
modpiracy,34ioky,ZarekSiel,3,Fri May 1 22:07:51 2015 UTC,"I can understand your logic. Sometimes, this system of selling mods actually works. But absolutely none of them are for sale under the title of mods, and they've been curated carefully. Say, for instance, Mount and Blade has a couple expansions that were made by modders who were contacted by the developers. But for this? They took the Valve approach, which was poorly disclosed, implemented the worst way possible, no curating for mods to be worth paying for, and no actual steps to ensure there wasn't some sabotage in the free versions. It won't work entirely hands-off, so Valve really shouldn't attempt it again."
modpiracy,34ioky,SetFireToTheRane,11,Fri May 1 23:42:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure that it was like that. I just don't think valve thought of a good way to contact skyrim modders.  The creator of SMIM (same TB interview thats on the front page of the sub) said himself that he had no idea this was happening until it came out.  Personally, if I worked for valve, the first people I would have contacted would be a list from the top recommended of all time on Nexus. This obviously didn't happen though. I'd imagine that they simply contacted the most popular skyrim, dota2, and CS:go modders on steam instead, and hoped for quality."
modpiracy,34ioky,Xzal,22,Fri May 1 14:42:56 2015 UTC,"They contacted Chesko and Isoku, so I think they knew of ways to contact popular modders. Just because they didn't contact SMIM's creator doesn't mean they had no idea how to get modders.  The entire thing was a blatant failure anyway. The two major modders underperformed (Chesko's mod taken down for copyright infringement - not to mention it wasn't even fully finished upon release. The new Wet&Cold removed major aspects of Wet and Cold because of copyright infringement as well, meaning the paid version had less features than the free)...  Then they get Dota2 and CS:go modders for a game with such an amazing modding community like Skyrim's?  And then they release utter shit mods?  Whole thing was rushed and poorly though out from the start, Bethesda and Steam clearly didn't have their shit together on this one."
modpiracy,34ioky,SetFireToTheRane,10,Fri May 1 14:57:00 2015 UTC,"TBH When i watched TB's video with Robin and SMIMs Creator, SMIM Guy came across very much hurt that he wasn't included. He had many true points, but I very much warrant he'd be singing a different tune if he was approached and had a day 1 mod up on the paid workshop.  I get the feeling he is playing along with the common consensus purely because he was not included.  Regarding Cheskos ""Copyright infringement"" - Chesko and the ""infringed"" creator both came out stating no such thing happened.  Chesko initially had permission and then the ""infringed"" person later changed his mind, Chesko AGREED to pull his own work, but VALVE refused to allow him to remove it. So the ""infringed party"" had to file a DMCA to get it pulled.  He filed the DMCA under recommendation of Chesko."

Chesko asked Valve if he could use someone else's assest, their lawyers said sure, if the original mod was free.   Turns out he couldn't, and there was a huge mess about it, and they DMCA'd it and it got pulled.  Which is still a huge failure from Valve in my book."
modpiracy,34ioky,SetFireToTheRane,2,Fri May 1 17:08:13 2015 UTC,"Okay I got that bit wrong, but the fact still remains it wasn't a full on infringement, as Chesko and the infringed creator DID discuss it amicably and both tried to have it pulled from the workshop only to be blocked by Valve.  Which meant they still needed to DMCA it."
modpiracy,34ioky,Kraosdada,4,Fri May 1 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right, but my point still stands, Valve dropped the ball on the whole thing. I mean, mods gettind DMCA'd and all, they should've thought of that before releasing it."

As individuals, modders carry more weight in the community than non-modders... However, we are not individuals - we are huge groups of people and what he is saying suggests that regardless of how many at the bottom says something, the people at the top still matter more - That is not right.  Without the bottom, there would be no top and he should remember that he would be nothing without the people below him.  It is like what Syndrome said in the incredibles - Here   ""When everyone's super, no one will be"". That goes for any community, including this one. We are the ones that make him seem super. If you are at the top, you need to be very careful with your words and actions because it is incredibly easy to say/do something stupid - kinda like what Valve did - They were regarded as gods among men and then proceeded to shit all over the people at the bottom.  Final words: The top would be nothing without the bottom - Without the bottom, ""Dark0ne"" would have no power to stand against Valve ...

modpiracy,34ljom,Vinifera7,3,Sun May 3 00:07:59 2015 UTC,"I know.

This simply isn't the case, obviously but he refuses to believe that people who really ARE apart of the community still oppose the idea of mod monetization as a whole.  TL;DR - He is simply brushing off the people who speak louder than him (as a group) as kids who aren't even in the community. He is bigoted, albeit, with some reason."

All that together = fewer server options for Nexus site meaning less mods making it on the site. This would however mean more quality mods being prioritized over lesser mods and in the end making the modding scene alot prettier at the expense of free modding for everyone.  I don't know but bottom line if all lurkers left (this includes random site vistors) nexus mods would be in serious trouble for a while they may recover they may not, sacrifices will have to be made in order to survive.

We're not talking about users vs one mod author.  We are talking about users vs all mod authors.  There's no doubt that the SMIM author is an asshole, but his opinion still holds more weight than yours, unless you've developed mods for this or other games over the span of the last decade."

Those who provide useful feedback on those mods are an even smaller minority group.  To sit back and say a fraction of the modding community, half of which stands to profit directly from paid mods and therefore supports the idea, should have greater pull than the rest is nonsense.  Any idiot can create a mod. Any idiot can write a few constructive sentences. Doing those things doesn't make you any better than those who don't. It doesn't mean you're more enlightened or deserve more weight to your opinion, especially in a situation where you're just as biased as those you're arguing against."

He's saying the consumer's opinion is worth less than the manufacturer's. How is that true? Without the consumer, the manufacturer doesn't exist. Without the manufacturer, the consumer will migrate to another manufacturer that decides to listen OR become a manufacturer him/herself.  That's how it works in a system where money is involved. If there isn't any money involved, fuck the consumer because the manufacturer has no reason to cater to them.  .. but Dark0ne wants a system with money involved, so he's wrong when he's talking in that context.  Consumer > manufacturer in terms of hierarchy of opinion."

Money isn't involved with mods, not yet at least. So your entire point is moot.  Also, Dark0ne is talking about what is now, not what could be. You are talking as if mods have already costed money and people have already paid for it.  I really don't understand how you can be this ignorant on the subject. It's like you are grasping at straws here on purpose."
modpiracy,34ljom,Vinifera7,2,Sat May 2 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"Dark0ne is talking in the context of paid mods and the debate surrounding them.  It doesn't matter if you create thousands of mods or not a single one, your opinion carries the same weight as someone who downloads thousands of mods or not a single one.  That changes when money is involved, like in the system that Dark0ne's conversation is about. So he's wrong."
modpiracy,34ljom,Haynekhtnamet,2,Sat May 2 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"The debate is about paid mods.

modpiracy,34ljom,1sb2gamer,1 point,Sat May 2 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"I apologize in advance as my English/ grammar writing is bad.  I think I am getting this all mixed up with youtube.. for some reason I keep thinking maybe why I am not pleased with what darkone said was because I was thinking in youtube terms. In youtube the viewers control the type of content is displayed on channels by voicing there opinions, and have a million or so viewers, just viewers alone really sway the youtube content creators on what should be lets played (showen etc etc) and not, even consumers in the real market mass people control the way things are done, COD is one example.  Even products in real life the market is controlled by the public by not buying it.  So what I am saying is, the people made it loud and clear they didn't want paid mods or at the very least done the right way, a 130k signatures were signed in opposition of paid mods, misunderstood yes but fact remains its the people the ""lurkers"" that control how things are done and things should be.  Before you say ""well that was the minority of the community because there are millions of skyrim players that have not voiced there opinion on the matter""  Where is the protest to keep paid mods? Where is the protest to keep paid mods but in a different way?  Sadly they would never amount to the people against it because they are truly the minority in this issue (the few modders and a 100 or 1000 supporters of mods earning profit)  When it comes to free and paid, free will always win, if paid mods were there from the start then yes, its to late to change at least not without huge bloodshred (figuratively) and tears, history has proven time and time again that people are slow to change to new ideas.  Believe it or not but I truly do think that modders should get rewarded for there work they've done and be paid for the work they will do, providing there is QA (quality assurance) with the current system of paid mods that's not possible to many variables.  In conclusion the reason I am not happy with what Darkone said is because the ""bottom of the hierarchy"" that he so states that is overwhelming more vocal and loud then the few experienced modders and supporters of the modders that contribute to the mod there opinion matters more then the mass of people, which would be true if it was a dictatorship system but its not, no matter how many times they say there opinion matters more then the mass of people the more they get crushed by the sheer weight of opposition. Sorry Darkone unfortunately its quantity over quality ."
modpiracy,34ljom,Sinonyx1,0,Sat May 2 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"Here is what I agree with you on.  Dark0ne tried to make it seem like those who disagreed and where part of the protest where likely the minority and may not have been part of the modding community at all. I don't agree with this idea at all, and I am 99% sure he is wrong. He clearly didn't pay attention to his own sites comments if that is what he really thinks.  The thing I disagree with you on is your youtube example. The reason viewers tend to have such a huge effect on what is on a channel is because the channel is usually there specifically for the viewers. Also, the youtuber in most cases is getting paid through ads. So pleasing their viewers means more income.  However, on youtube what Dark0ne said also tends to apply. A youtuber tends to listen more to their audience and not just some random person that shows up on their channel. If you are a subscriber and you comment a lot, your opinion is likely to hold more weight than someone the channel owner has never seen."

I agree however when the mass of people outnumber the people that subscribed and commented and been a long time supporter of that channel that becomes irrelevant, if the mass of people are more vocal and loud the opinion of the elite so to speak will be buried under alot of white noise.  It is true I'll just call them elite that there opinions matter more but when your opinion is opposed by certain X of non elite people there opinions of the elite get pushed aside.  This is probably the most I have ever typed in my entire life and I suck at spelling and grammar so its a pain to do and I type only like 17 words per minute I think? My fingers are so cramped right now I feel like chopping them off lol  I thank you 1sb2gamer I am not trying to start a war or something all I wanted to do was voice my opinion to the best of my spelling and grammar ability I don't know if many people will agree with me or none at all, I can never hope to win or lose this debate because everyone has a good opinion for good and bad."
modpiracy,34ljom,Nickname863,0,Sat May 2 20:24:31 2015 UTC,"Ok, I agree with what you say here.  Let's try to break this down so you understand a litte better what Dark0ne meant.  1 on 1, that is one person against another, one who are active (the elite), against just a random individual. The Elite's opinion is going to be held to a higher regard because of their status.  1 on 100, the elite vs 100 random individuals. The Elite's opinion is significantly less now that it's 100 individuals who disagree. In this case it's an iffy. It depends on how high in regards this elite is. The more individuals you have the less the elites opinion is taken.  So if you say have 100 elites vs 100,000 random individuals. The elites opinion isn't going to matter.  See the issue is, I am almost certain Dark0ne was specifically talking about a 1 vs 1 situation."

If every mod I ran was $2, it would quickly turn into a $300 game, and that makes absolutely no sense to me. At that price point, TES6 is no longer worth it.  I wish the lesson to Valve and Bethesda was, ""Not everything needs to be monetized.""  Instead, I am afraid the lesson will be, ""Wait a few months and implement this in a new game without an established modding base and no one will bitch.""

And i am, in gerneral, pretty shy when it comes to Commenting on stuff like mods (kinda ironic that i post my thoughts on the internet). I installed a lot of TES mods since Oblivion and i totally love (and endorse) them. So i ask myself did i ever actually contibute something to the modding community. And if not how could i change that."

People don't realize how good it feels to see something you made get 200,000 downloads, even if they were all free.  Non-modders are just as important as modders, we give the feedback they need to improve. If everyone could mod, there'd be little to no need for a community, thus there'd be no Nexus, no Workshop, no ModDB. It's literally the principle of capitalism. No customers? No sellers.

""Non modders"" are as important as you said, i just meant to tell you that modders are players too ! besides you you already spent time installing mods, making selection, reporting bugs and suggesting changes thus contributing to game design you're already a non-non-modder ;p"
modpiracy,34fbae,TunEks,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:02:31 2015 UTC,"... I think you missed my point entirely. Allow me to reiterate.  ""If we were all modders, there'd be no modding community."" This would cause an over-saturation of mods. Everybody would either be rallying to do exactly the same things, or nobody would because of the fact everybody can do what they want without looking elsewhere. We wouldn't need each other. That's even basic nature. Why go to you when I can do it just as well?  ""If everyone could mod, there'd be little to no need for a community, thus there'd be no Nexus, no Workshop, no ModDB."" This point is similar, but this is the RESULT of everyone being modders. Websites wouldn't be required as I could simply create a new sword if I wanted to. Or a new game mechanic. Or a new quest.  ""It's literally the principle of capitalism. No customers? No sellers."" Yup yup yup. If nobody has any need for any other modder, there's no need to spend money on websites, and things like dropbox would reign supreme. Simple file-hosting, or transfers through Skype calls for example, would be sufficient. This wouldn't be necessary either, as I could just make my own sword instead of looking for someone to make it for me.  If everyone was a modder, it WOULD be heaven, yes. But that's a utopia that cannot exist, as much as many of us would love it to be real. It's a dream to chase, for sure. But we have to remember individuals are different.  I cannot agree with you more on your learning point, though. Modding is a FANTASTIC way of learning proper game design, artistry, and fiddling around with lines of code.  But the thing is, we can't expect everyone to be modders. Be it motivation, other goals in life, or simply too busy to take up the task. So, the modding community needs each other. Modders, non-modders. We're a symbiotic relationship. And that's a good thing.  I mean don't get me wrong I'm not trying to cause an arguement or anything like that! I'm just saying why I believe mods should remain free. It's simply due to how modding is done, and how non-modders can provide benefits to the modders beyond simple money. And the fact that if everyone could mod, there's little need for sharing tips and tricks, because it assumes everyone has learned to use the proper tools and programs. Blender, SDK, that kind of stuff. It takes a long time to get that kind of technical skill."

I don't agree there just because everyone can do something, that doesn't mean that everyone would do the same. You assume that everyone would have the exact same level of skill i guess. Which is never the case. Look at art: Everyone can draw (on different skillevels or artstyles) but there isn't really an  over-saturation.

It's stated that mod users/gamers feel entitled but are not entitled to mod devs free time/mods/hard work and that mod users only want free content.  Both guests agree that steam shouldn't have been ""bullied"" into giving up pay for mods so soon so they can collect more data.  All 3 agree that the implementation of paid for mods by steam was done horribly wrong and Nick McCaskey(SMIM Dev) said that $4 for a sword was ridiculous and that troll mods should be removed.  Both agreed the paid mod workshop needs to be curated and steam has a obligation to protect its users.   All 3 agree that the 19 mods that where on the workshop for sale where garbage accept for 1 or 2 like wet and cold.  Robin ""Dark0ne"" Scott(nexus site admin) said mod devs where consulted by valve on this selling mods on steam and where most likely told that it would not work the way it was done and needed to make changes and that their would be a lot of backlash. Valve did not listen, only changed minor things.  Robin said that this whole thing caused a lot of drama on the nexus forums even between other mod developers and was upset that people where mad/attacking one another,especially for attacking people who chose to sell mods.  All 3 said try to see it from the mod developers perspective.  Nick McCaskey said ""stand by your principles instead of what the angry internet mob says""  Total biscuit said, Before criticizing someone walk a mile in their shoes so when you go to criticize them you are a mile away and you have their shoes.

Look at gaming history...whenever someone has an idea good or bad as long as it makes money there's 10001 copy cats. Just look at steam. Paid modding takes off and suddenly DBM is $5, WoL is $6.  Developer release even more buggy games case they'll make money off the mods that fix it.  Off the top of my head games that maynot have started something but in turn spawned copy cats.  Donkey Kong, Double Dragon, Street Fighter 2, MineCraft (double one here money from releasing a paid alpha and well just minecraft clones), WoW, Medal Of Honor, Doom, Mortal Kombat, VF, TF2, HearthStone, DotA, Limbo, SimCity, Steam.

If consumers don't like what they are selling then they do not have to like it or buy it.  That being said I would be more then happy to buy a quality mod for $5 or so, a mod that adds quests/weapons/armor/new locations/new enemies/new game mechanics/ or a mod like SMIM would get $5 from me but those troll mods selling for $5 that just add a set of armor is ridiculous.  Also its not really fair to say everyone against steams mods for sale system wasn't apart of the community considering a few mod authors of respectable mods came out and said that it was a bad idea and they too wanted steam to remove it.  Other then that I agree with everything else in this video, it wouldn't hurt so much if mod developers could make a living off of developing good quality mods and steam/bethesda really messed up the implementation."

The civil war is dull and uninteresting to everyone who's not actively fighting in it right at this second. The ludicrous number of invincible NPCs (ZOMG!

The complete and total reliance on the HUD to convey essentially all information (where the exact location of your objective is, whether or not enemies can see you, etc). The extremely high reliance on combat to solve pretty much all problems (""Go kill this thing. Why? 'Cause we said so. All forsworn/vampires/whatevers are pure evil don'tcha know.""). This is exacerbated by the number of mysteriously invincible side characters mentioned above. The fact that hard enemies require more cheesing than actual planning. The poor combat in general. Etc.

Funny thing is, most of GG hardly even mentions her, we try to ignore her. The only time she's posted about on KIA is when she inserts herself (like talking to congress about it). Yet she's constantly brought up by aGGros, for some reason.   We can actually call her a rapist - not by the actual definition, but by her own definition. ""If you cheat on someone and then have sex with them without telling, it's rape"" is an opinion she has expressed, and by that definition she's a rapist. It's not something that's really relevant, but I think it's telling of her person.   The thing he did was talk shit about her on the internet and get a legion of idiots to send her abuse.   Except he didn't. He never wanted people to go after her.

I don't really like modding, but here I am... modding away and I'm totally miserable and I'm really not having any fun and because it's ACTUAL work instead of an engaging challenge, I should be paid.""  And I say... well yeah.  If that were the case.  The moment modders start talking about a hobby as if it's some kind of chore, is the moment I really don't want much to do with their mods.  Hell, I don't even want to pirate them."
modpiracy,34en7s,kontankarite,5,Thu Apr 30 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"As if they were patiently awaiting the day that a paid mod system would be introduced, so they would finally be compensated.  I agree, it's a total bullshit argument, and the ones making it are the ones who had dollar signs in their eyes when this thing was announced.  Introduce money = introduce greed.  Happens with anything.  No matter what people say, the mod scene was always just about making cool shit out of a passion for games.  No one was ever in it to get rich."

modpiracy,34en7s,Magister_Ingenia,-4,Thu Apr 30 18:48:34 2015 UTC,"Of course, if everyone just went to work instead of modding, we wouldn't exactly have mods then would we? Of course there are other motivations and all (like enjoyment), but plenty of careers exist for people who are passionate about it- especially in the tech field. Why can't modding be a career/job? So long as you're doing everything by the books and legally (within the realm of licensing/copyright/etc), what's the issue?"
modpiracy,34en7s,headlessgargoyle,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:02:59 2015 UTC,"This is the way it works and we still have mods. People go to work and stop making mods and new blood comes in.  There will always be people who don't have jobs when they are just starting out. Many modders become game developers such as myself and stop modding.  Modding is one of those things you normally wouldn't consider a job because it's a way to earn experience before you get into the actual career.  Which does bring me to a new point I didn't think of until now. If modding does become a career, wouldn't that mean less becoming game developers? I would assume that may cause problems in the future, unless they purposefully make it say modders earn less.  If they earned more, than I can assume many game devs might switch to modding too."

This sentence was mostly sarcasm in response to the above post, that was saying modders should get a job if they want money. I took it to the extreme of all modders doing just that. Of course that's not realistic, but it was in the hopes of showing that modders having other jobs may hurt modding as well which progressed into a ""why not.""  Many modders are novices, you're entirely correct. Modders, due to basically being self employed and having such a largely competitive scene, would very likely earn less, but even more so it would be less stable. Working for a game dev firm would be considerably more so, and so those aiming for stability would likely switch over continue on the modding -> game dev path.  Though you're right, if it was found that there was more money in paid modding, I imagine quite a few would switch. Hell, modding firms might even pop up which could solve the issue of stability. Though they'd likely be about as stable as an indie game company."

I've tried upwards 1,000 mods, maybe more. I'd pay for maybe 40 of those, if I wasn't allowed to test them before paying, that number shrinks to about 20.  Korodic may think his mod would get him paid, but here's the fun truth, no it would not. His mod's were not worth money, in a world where all you get is a description and some screen shots to decide if you want to lay down $2 on a mod, his crap isn't worth jack shit.  The mods that make money are DLC class mods, House mods with Quests, Companion mods with Voice acting and quests, and armor and weapon mods that prey on people with shitty impulse control."

We're talking all star fantasy modding teams.  Put these people to work for something worth buying.  My god I fucking wish it was like that!

modpiracy,34en7s,Notalent13,2,Fri May 1 02:56:15 2015 UTC,"Either idea is pretty solid, but I feel a warning is needed, indie developers don't make much money, period. Non all star developers don't make much money, period. The mod authors doing this would not make the kinda money they seem to think they will.  That's the trap here, everyone's looking at the massive amounts of money gaming makes and thinks they can get a slice of it, but most of that money goes to the publishers and their investors. The developers often get fucked unless they are considered indispensable, and mod authors will have it even worse.  Edit: What I'd really like to see is Bethesda allow Kickstarters and Indiegogo campaigns for mods. Let the community decide what they want to pay for and support Authors work on that directly."

The plan was probably always to split the community and let us fight it out, while the authors took the heat.

All I'm going to say is that there's a lot of talent out there in the modding community that when combined, makes a megazord of awesome.  And I'm all for Bethesda getting involved and creating impromptu modding teams to make official third party DLC.  We're talking stuff on the scale of Falskaar with some interesting game mechanics added in.  Maybe even give those modders special access to some of the hard code of the game so that not only can they expand content, they can add extra things such has honest-to-god one handed mini crossbows and extra things the likes that Dawnguard added.  The best example is the crossbow.  You can't even use them or mods like them unless you have Dawnguard."

modpiracy,34en7s,kontankarite,-1,Sun May 3 10:02:27 2015 UTC,"Does anyone care to comment on their arguments? I've frankly a tendency to sympathize with them and would like to hear some well thought out rebuttals.  Note that I've read other arguments as well, some admittedly more valid (such as arguments about Valve), but I haven't specifically read any on these arguments."
modpiracy,34en7s,1sb2gamer,10,Thu Apr 30 16:07:50 2015 UTC,"Sure, here are my thoughts.  His first point to me .. is 100% absolutely true. No one is entitled to another persons work. There really isn't much of an argument against this, unless you want to look greedy. However his argument that not every mod would cost money, to me, is a poor excuse because it may not be the mods people want. A good example of this would be Frostfall, let's say that went paid. There wouldn't be another mod that is free that is comparable. In my eyes, if a mod author really wants to start getting paid, they need to start with new mods, not mods that are already free.  Now support is a whole other issue and I think his argument is lacking. Yes, ""he"" may actually offer proper support. That does not mean others will. There are many mod authors out there that don't offer great support and when people mention it, they tend to get pissy. Usually with a line like, you don't have to use it. Mod authors can't be doing this anymore if they want their mod to be paid. However, it brings us to the next issue. They hold absolutely no responsibility or obligations to actually offer support or update their mods. The customers don't have any control over this, and that is what makes it incredibly unappealing.   His third point, I don't believe I heard anyone say that. Though if someone did, they are silly. However his argument for how long he has spend in the creation kit is also pretty stupid. No one forced him to do that. He did it all on his own accord, knowing he may never get paid for such work.  As for the donation button ordeal. He is wrong. He only received 1 donation because not many even knew they could donate. The donate button wasn't even noticeable on Nexus up until recently. So many modders keep using this excuse, but it pisses me off because they never actively tried to even get donations. How can you argue this, if you never even lifted a finger to try? There are plenty of people making money off of donations for their mods in the minecraft community, some even making a living off it. There is also that Skylines modder who used to work for maxis who is also making tons of cash off of donations. Why are these people able to do it and not skyrim modders? The main reason is because Bethesda forbid earning money off of mods. So if anyone is to blame, then it would be Bethesda, not the community. Even the Skywind team has to get donations in a round about way because of this. So, yes, donations work ... it just has to be allowed and you have to actually lift a finger to try.  As for copyright issues. I agree with him, it would be the modders issue. However, this also includes those who steal other modders work. So this can effect collaboration and or the types of mods released. so it does slightly effect everyone. You could, also be paying for a mod you didn't realize was copyrighted work. So it most certainly does harm the consumer.  As for his last sentence ... the skills of modding do pay. It's called becoming a game developer. Many modders including myself become game developers eventually. That is usually why we started modding to begin with, because we like to create things. Modding isn't a career, as some of them are trying to make it be."
modpiracy,34en7s,headlessgargoyle,3,Thu Apr 30 16:46:05 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, it seems to me a large majority are unaware of what going from hobbyists to salesmen/service providers (which is what would happen if they started charging for mods) would entail. Taxes, responsibilities, customer service... not to mention customers now would actually be entitled now."
modpiracy,34en7s,1sb2gamer,2,Thu Apr 30 18:13:39 2015 UTC,As a person who would most likely work by himself and be 100% responsible for all blowback or whathaveyou... I am not the one.
modpiracy,34en7s,headlessgargoyle,2,Thu Apr 30 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, I bet most of them didn't even really give it much thought in that regard."
modpiracy,34en7s,1sb2gamer,-2,Thu Apr 30 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"Nice reply, thanks.  I think your support argument is lacking though, obviously it's based on context, but in general I've seen far more mods, both for Skyrim and other games where the developers in some form offer a decent level of support. They might not hold your hand through it, but I've seen plenty of lists of incompatible mods, plenty of patches for other mods, plenty of detailed installation instructions for non-standard installs (hell, even for standard installs), and plenty of modders being active on forums/pages for their work and attempting to solve problems/fix bugs/and the like. While like I said, this won't apply to everyone, a lot of devs already do this. I think the major change would be an expectation of continued support- ie updating if the game gets updated and the like.   For something like Skyrim specifically, I personally feel like it's particularly flooded with absolutely shit mods (even before this whole ordeal), it seemed like everyone and their mother wanted to reskin something and then decided to publish it on nexus, so I could see support for mods like that also being shit, however if those types of mods go paid, I don't see it as causing a significant issue because just like with a consumer having no control over support, as long as the consumer has their wits about them they often be able to recognize the issue (either through community comments, the lack of a description of the mod, lack of images, etc), and if they don't behave intelligently it is my personal opinion that it would be their fault for making the bad purchase. (Note that it's not their fault for the bad mod existing, but bad mods have always existed). In no other aspect of life are consumers protected from wasting money, no one will stop you from buying stuff on late night tv, or garage sales, or flea markets, or in app purchases (or apps in general), why should modding, or indeed game development in general (looking at you early access/ greenlight) be special?   As for the donation problem, honestly, my experience aligns with his. I've modded for a variety of games, including minecraft since you specifically mention it, and received fuck-all for donations (with a decent amount of downloads) WITH a donation link a nice little section specifically talking about how I relied on donations. Now I respect entirely that others will have different experiences on the matter, but I don't think I've ever heard a modder aside from the top of the top of the line be able to live off donations. This isn't about that .01% though, this is about creating a job market, and why can't modding be a career? Sure, it hasn't been one historically, and yeah, it would certainly shake up the community, but it's an aspect of game development that has a rather large demand and skilled people willing to fill it.  I can agree with the rest of your points."
modpiracy,34en7s,headlessgargoyle,2,Thu Apr 30 19:59:20 2015 UTC,"No no no. You have seen far more ""popular"" mods that offer decent support, but do you realize how many mods there are? I said there are many mods authors who do not offer decent support. How exactly is my argument in that matter lacking? It's true.  Also, I am sorry, I hate to say this, but your argument is incredibly stupid.   This line in particular "" the consumer has their wits about them they often be able to recognize the issue (either through community comments, the lack of a description of the mod, lack of images, etc), and if they don't behave intelligently it is my personal opinion that it would be their fault for making the bad purchase. "" You are pointing out the damned obvious here. If someone buys something that has questionable description, images or what not .. then holy crap .. no duh it's be stupid if someone buys it. What kind of an argument is that? There are plenty of mods that exist, that look good, sound good, and even may work good for a bit of time until you really start thoroughly testing it. Especially in a game like Skyrim, where a single mod can cause crashes in a very specific location and you wouldn't know till you get there. So please try to come up with a better argument.   As for buying things, in most places have a very decent return policy. It's rare that you go somewhere and buy crap that you can't return. So that argument is pretty crap as well. Also, your examples of where people might go to buy things are filled with shady places where most people don't tend to buy things. You purposefully did that to make it fit your argument, because those places in particular may not have a return policy.  ""As for the donation problem, honestly, my experience aligns with his. I've modded for a variety of games, including minecraft since you specifically mention it, and received fuck-all for donations (with a decent amount of downloads) WITH a donation link a nice little section specifically talking about how I relied on donations. Now I respect entirely that others will have different experiences on the matter, but I don't think I've ever heard a modder aside from the top of the top of the line be able to live off donations."" Then don't freaking live off of donations. That isn't the point. Modding isn't a damned career and it never will be. I said there are plenty of modders earning money, not earning a living. I said there are SOME earning a living. If you make good mods, you can earn donations from it, if you have a following. If you don't have a following, then maybe it's because you suck, either at making mods or getting yourself out there. If you do have a following, and you still don't earn some money through donations, it's because you are crap at getting donations and don't know how to properly do it.  If people really want to turn ""modding"" into a career, then they need to realize it's no longer being a modder. You are now a third party developer, creating third party content, for IP's that you do not own. You all can try and chalk it up to still modding all you want, but in my eyes that isn't modding. That is making assets for a game, for a pretty crappy cut of the pay when you could instead get hired by an actual company and become an actual developer working on assets while being paid full time and not reliant on an unsteady income.  In other words, modders who want to make it a career are just settling for less. Also .. what does a modder do when the game they worked on no longer is popular and they lose a huge chunk of their profit? Making this into a career means you will not be modding just for the games you like. You will need to mod even when you do not want to, to make sure you stay relevant and that paycheck still roles in."
modpiracy,34en7s,1sb2gamer,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:30:53 2015 UTC,"I was respectful to you, I would request that you refrain from personal insults and ad hominem. Sorry for the long post in advance, but at least you responded in kind! I definitely appreciate that, too often will I write up a decent amount just to be responded to with a sentence.   You have seen far more ""popular"" mods that offer decent support, but do you realize how many mods there are?   According to the numbers on Nexus they host 39710 skyrim mods. Steam seems to have around 25k. So yes, I have a grasp of the numbers, and I stand by my statement. Even the non-popular mods I have seen with only a few hundred downloads at most, so long as the mod dev themselves are still active, do have some support. Whether or not they are active (especially nowadays, at least for skyrim) is a bit of a crapshoot, but if they are, it's normally not a big deal at least so long as you yourself are respectful. ""Many"" is also a generally relative term, ie, many don't compared to those who do offer support. I'm saying that in my experience this is false so long as we exclude inactive modders (which is admittedly something I had not mentioned though I thought it might be understood, as if they're not active, of course there won't be support). If we include inactive modders, then it's obvious the number is going to support your conclusion due solely to that the game is old enough and many novice modders/one-offs would have just up and left. Luckily, because they've up and left, their mods won't be switching to paid any time soon, well, under the current state none will, but I digress. I'm afraid this is simply a difference of experience, and while I respect yours it certainly doesn't align with mine. A survey would solve the problem one way or the other, but that's far more effort than I'm looking to put into this conversation.  Also, if you don't think people buy things from garage sales or buy apps, you're horribly mistaken. The flea markets I've been to seem pretty popular as well, though I can't say I frequent them. Realistically, the same could be said of shopping at Walmart, as lasting quality is often up in the air there, and that has a far larger audience.  My understanding was that even with purchasable mods there would be a return policy, though admittedly with a rather limited window, and because valve's a dick putting the refund to the steam wallet. My examples of where people might go are places where people are likely to get screwed because they're making poor decisions. This is an open market, and every decision must be made individually without regard for ""it's on steam therefore it's good"" because that in and of itself is a poor decision. With mods, especially with those that might be purchasable, you're basically going to a flea market anyway. It's the same with app stores for that matter, there's only a certain level of information you can gleam off it, and it may not be a complete picture.   If you're not okay with steam/valve having a flea market, then I can certainly understand the concern here, but non-paying mods are basically in a similar setup without money exchanging hands- you're trusting them/the reviews on their word and hoping it doesn't permanently fuck up your game, either way you have no means of recourse, and none was realistically offered either. You can argue implication due to purchasing, but plenty of games and game devs are pretty shitty about support, some arguably worse than modders just not responding (see nexon as a perhaps hyperbolic example, or sony online entertainment as a more common occurrence). While the expectation would indeed likely be there to continue to support the product, ultimately the modder themselves would have to deal with the repercussions of offering poor support or not offering it at all, specifically in that the lifespan of their mod would be considerably shorter than it might otherwise be- hurting their overall profits. This certainly isn't something new, and because all mods I've seen have a comment/forum system associated with it, so long as you're not the one of the first purchasers, you'll be able to get information on their support style relatively rapidly.  Besides, while admittedly a shitty scenario, if it works amazing for the 20-40 hours of in game time you need to play test it, and then it starts causing issues, you've probably gotten your money out of it and the devs probably deserve that money. Of course, if it's causing issues within the first few hours of play- as long as you played immediately after purchasing it would still be possible to return it. If you didn't get around to testing the mod relatively immediately then you didn't do your job as an intelligent consumer. It can be admittedly difficult with mods, as returns should exist, but at the same time you can't have an ""unopened/unused"" policy many stores have, or even really a hardly used policy, as if we're doing a one-size-fits-all style of return some mods, such as quest mods, could be rushed through rapidly and returned such that the user got the full experience of the mod effectively for free. Not all mods would be affected by this of course, but hopefully you can at least see the point in having a limited window for returns. Whether or not the 24 hours reported is realistically an appropriate number is certainly arguable.   If you do have a following, and you still don't earn some money through donations, it's because you are crap at getting donations and don't know how to properly do it.   Or maybe it's because really a lot of people don't donate. It's not like tipping in American restaurants, you have quite a few factors to deal with. First of all most people who might donate only do so after play testing, which means if you're on something like nexus they actually have to revisit the page. That in and of itself will cut your audience pretty horribly, especially if your mod works well and someone would have no reason to visit the comments/readme/etc. Second of all, a lot of people fall for the bystander effect here (see experiment 2 here, sadly, it's behind a paywall, but even the abstract supports diffusion of responsibility), and will presume others have donated and therefore feel no immediate need to donate themselves.  Your argument on ""well then that isn't modding"" is arguing semantics at best. They're modifying a game for the purpose of improving the experience. You can call that third party content if you so choose, but it's the same process as someone else who does it for free and calls it modding.   In other words, modders who want to make it a career are just settling for less. Also .. what does a modder do when the game they worked on no longer is popular and they lose a huge chunk of their profit?   So what if a modder is settling, what right do you have to tell them not to, especially if they're happy? Let them settle. Plenty of people do it all the time. Would you say a nurse shouldn't be a nurse because they're settling and not becoming a RN?  A modder who made a career out of it would simply find a new game that they wish to work on (enjoyment or not, though it is still going to be their choice what games to work on). Of course they'll have to put in time and effort and ""mod when they don't want to"" surely in whatever job experience you've had you've done the same. There are some days I don't want to work, but fuck it I do anyway because I need the money. It's kinda the whole problem of being a paycheck-to-paycheck adult, and it's the same problem that plagues most freelance workers as well (though admittedly most freelancers wouldn't have to pay licensing fees, though they may have other start up fees of course). If they stop enjoying it so much as to cause problems, I'd advise the same thing I'd advise to anyone who doesn't enjoy their work: find a new job. Modding done in this manner could also be an in-between job, or side job, done to get experience, or just make a some reasonable amounts of side money."
modpiracy,34en7s,desertcoyote77,2,Fri May 1 01:16:33 2015 UTC,"I was respectful to you, I would request that you refrain from personal insults and ad hominem.   Where? I didn't insult you personally, and I certainly didn't attack your character. Saying something you said is stupid is neither of those. If I called you stupid, then that would be an insult and an ad hominem. At least from my understanding of those words.   I'm afraid this is simply a difference of experience, and while I respect yours it certainly doesn't align with mine.   And there is your problem. You can't base your argument on your experience alone, especially in a debate. Also, I need to point out, that when I talk about support, I mean the kind you normally would receive for things you pay for. Meaning no matter how stupid the question, or issue, you have to deal with it. Yes, many mods do come with support, and many modders are happy to help with someones issues. This doesn't really apply to every modder though, and many do not offer that kind of support. Instead of going by your experience .. want me to just show you some examples? The modder of Perkus Maximus, while does have alright support, isn't what I would consider ""professional."" Any times someone has a problem he will say they need to read the front page or this and that. Sorry but that isn't how you handle support of your customer is paying. In other words, many modders who offer support do it in ways at times that wouldn't be accepted in most cases with something you pay for.   Also, if you don't think people buy things from garage sales or buy apps, you're horribly mistaken.   I never said they do not, I said it's not where people typically shop all to often. Also, your example with Walmart can't be taken seriously unless you actually have some examples of this happening. Citation needed in other words. How often do you buy something from Walmart, that ends up not lasting beyond it's typical usage? Also, at what point does it make the purchase a bad one and that persons fault? Do keep in mind, your original statement was that it was a customers fault if they purchased something questionable. So, with what you stated here, I am fairly certain you missed the point.   My understanding was that even with purchasable mods there would be a return policy, though admittedly with a rather limited window, and because valve's a dick putting the refund to the steam wallet. My examples of where people might go are places where people are likely to get screwed because they're making poor decisions.   I am really confused on exactly what it is your arguing here and what your point is. I was originally pointing out problems with what this person said based on what was offered. It sounds like to me, that you again are missing the point on something. Let's just put it this way, I honestly have no idea how to respond appropriately because I feel like we are both not on the same page.   You can argue implication due to purchasing, but plenty of games and game devs are pretty shitty about support   Nexon having poor support I can agree with, though not a good example as all their games are Free to Play. Meaning you can most certainly play their products without paying a cent. It also depended on which game it was you where playing. Mabinogi, I know has really crap support. As for SOE, I have no idea because I never dealt with them.  The other issue and point you seem to be missing here, is games created by devs are less likely to even need support. While mods on the other hand you are taking a bigger risk. While you can most certainly argue that you should know you are taking that risk, it's also a good reason against not having to pay for it. Why pay for something more risky? If you are going to put up a sub par product up for sale, then maybe it shouldn't cost as much as they are selling it for. I mean, really it just raises more issues than it solves. As a modder myself, and game developer ... I personally wouldn't ever buy a mod. I would be happy to donate if I like it, but buying it before I have tested it enough to even know if I like it .. to me isn't going to fly to well. Also .. again 24 hours isn't going to work.   If you didn't get around to testing the mod relatively immediately then you didn't do your job as an intelligent consumer.   See ... now is about the time where I really want to insult you. No ... no no no Are you crazy? I am sorry but no. That isn't how customer service works and you clearly don't understand that if this is what you really think. People have lives. If consumers can't even trust in a product anymore, why on earth should they buy? If that is how it's going to be, I hope to god people protest against paid mods, since they shouldn't have to be constantly checking the things they buy. I certainly wouldn't buy anything from you, after this conversation. XD You essentially keep trying to say it's the consumers fault. You would make a great scam artist, since I can imagine they think in the same manner. Stop trying to put all the blame on the consumer. If you have to do that, then that means even more of a reason why this isn't a good idea.   Not all mods would be affected by this of course, but hopefully you can at least see the point in having a limited window for returns. Whether or not the 24 hours reported is realistically an appropriate number is certainly arguable.   No it isn't arguable. 24 hours is crap. Just as much as someone can grab the quest mod play through and return it, by the same token they could just pirate it. That is no reason to punish everyone else with bad service.   Or maybe it's because really a lot of people don't donate.   If this was the case, sites like patreon would not exist. You can say people don't donate, but to much evidence suggests otherwise. The only conclusion you can make from this is that there has to be a difference in what these people are doing. We can already conclude people most certainly do donate. Now you just have to figure out, why they are not donating to you specifically.   Second of all, a lot of people fall for the bystander effect here (see experiment 2 here, sadly, it's behind a paywall, but even the abstract supports diffusion of responsibility), and will presume others have donated and therefore feel no immediate need to donate themselves.   This doesn't really mean anything to this argument, because we are not arguing about how many donate. We are arguing if people donate at all really and if it's viable for modders to earn some cash. Whether or not person A or B donated doesn't matter as long as person C did. Again, plenty of people earn donations just fine, you only have to figure out why not you. If you are not earning them, you are doing something wrong. Again that is the only logical conclusion.   Your argument on ""well then that isn't modding"" is arguing semantics at best. They're modifying a game for the purpose of improving the experience. You can call that third party content if you so choose, but it's the same process as someone else who does it for free and calls it modding.   Then why don't we all just call it game developing instead of modding? I figured we have these different words and such to separate these things apart. I am only trying to differentiate the differences between making a mod and making paid third party content. Mods have been traditionally free for the most part. So I don't think it would be appropriate to use the same word. lol maybe we will just call it premium mods. Whatever.   So what if a modder is settling, what right do you have to tell them not to, especially if they're happy? Let them settle. Plenty of people do it all the time. Would you say a nurse shouldn't be a nurse because they're settling and not becoming a RN?   I never told anyone not to, and again I am starting to think about insulting you. They can do whatever it is they well damned please. Just as much as I can have my own damned opinion on the matter. You really need to learn to read properly and stop taking my words out of context or what ever it is you are doing. If I say, they are settling for less, that is not me telling them they can't settle for less. I really hope to god you know the difference, now that I had to explain it.   A modder who made a career out of it would simply find a new game that they wish to work on (enjoyment or not, though it is still going to be their choice what games to work on). Of course they'll have to put in time and effort and ""mod when they don't want to"" surely in whatever job experience you've had you've done the same. There are some days I don't want to work, but fuck it I do anyway because I need the money. It's kinda the whole problem of being a paycheck-to-paycheck adult, and it's the same problem that plagues most freelance workers as well (though admittedly most freelancers wouldn't have to pay licensing fees, though they may have other start up fees of course). If they stop enjoying it so much as to cause problems, I'd advise the same thing I'd advise to anyone who doesn't enjoy their work: find a new job. Modding done in this manner could also be an in-between job, or side job, done to get experience, or just make a some reasonable amounts of side money.   If modding does become a career choice. I think it's going to cause even more problems than we already have in this industry. If the backlash showed anything, it showed people are tired of being nickel and dimed. I think it's funny modder wants to be part of the reason many gamers hate companies these days like EA."

modpiracy,34blhr,HomerSimpsonXronize,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:28:55 2015 UTC,No idea what you mean by that. I have a friend who knows a lot about the lore and has informed me about this guy(can't think of his name at this time) who wrote some books or whatever in Morrowind and yet everyone takes all his fan fiction bullshit as fact.   So is that what you are referring to or is there really an inconsistency with lore?
modpiracy,34blhr,CaptainMadoc,2,Fri May 1 09:59:28 2015 UTC,"No, I'm just referring to how some pieces of lore are plain missing or just poorly written on Bethesda's part.  I mean, I could try to bring up many many reasons why I hated Dawnguard, but last time I did that, #skyrim and Youtube laughed me out of wanting to even say any more.  I also count armor and weapon designs as part of the lore, but this being the fantasy community, I might as well try to catch smoke. If they don't bat an eyelid as to how I think the Skyrim-era Imperial, Orcish and Elven armors should probably look, then likely they'll just ridicule me for trying to ruin their beloved company's efforts, because of course I'm not allowed to try to fix the Imperial armor, nevermind how it looks like it's not only inarticulate, but also unsafe to wear, just like the ones in Oblivion.  And don't even get me started on the minor things that are missing, like, why aren't there proper martial artists? Why does everyone fight like they're drunk? Why do people think ""Shinji Gaiden"" isn't a name that native Japanese people would think is a name a grade schooler would come up with in his Kamen Rider fanfic? Why did they write it so that Durak revealed that the crossbow is a recent invention, instead of being a gastraphetes-like device that could've easily been invented by a bored Atmoran many ages ago?  I could just go on and on and on about this. At the same time, I should probably just keep all of these grievances to myself, because so far, no one wants to hear it. Not even what I've drawn so far will probably get them to finally pay attention."
modpiracy,34blhr,HomerSimpsonXronize,1 point,Fri May 1 14:06:05 2015 UTC,I am the wrong person to talk about Skyrim or TESLore to haha. I have only really played Oblivion and so so little of Skyrim that I barely know anything.

modpiracy,34ao54,cmagoun,55,Wed Apr 29 21:29:35 2015 UTC,"Oh, I am pretty sure paid mods are a certainty in the future. It is free money for the publisher and distributor. I would be surprised if TES6 and Fallout 4 did not feature paid mods in the Workshop.  One of my main questions about the whole idea is this: Exactly how much am I expected to pay for a Bethesda game over the course of its lifetime? I bought Skyrim for $60, 3 DLCs at a total of say $40, and I run 50-100 mods. Am I really expected to make the choice between a pretty good game at $60, or an awesome game at a $300 price point? Let's not forget that that collection of mods to turn my pretty good game into an awesome one occasionally crashes my game, or corrupts a save. I might have to download 3rd party programs to help me manage this paid for collection, which hey, might as well charge for that too, right?  At some point, it just isn't worth it... and I am, if not a ""whale"", at least ""whale-ish"". I love games and I don't mind paying for them. I buy a ton of games, and if I buy a game, I often buy all the DLC. I don't mind MMO subscriptions. Generally, in my gaming life, I am not looking for a free ride, and yet the idea of paying for Skyrim/TES6/FOut4 mods makes me uncomfortable.  Should mod creators be allowed to seek compensation for their work? Maybe. That sounds stupid... of course, they should be permitted to seek compensation, but should I be the one compensating them? I really can't say. Perhaps I am being an entitled, internet, schmuck gamer, but look, my back catalog of PS2 games is enough to last me the rest of my lifetime. Now, add my back catalog of Steam games to that equation... and any game on the market has an uphill battle to compete for my attention.  Before this mess, Bethesda games had a leg-up on the competition, not because I knew that I would get a decent game out of the box -- there are a lot of ""decent out of the box"" games -- but because I knew that over the course of time, modders would make the game great. This might still be the case, but at what cost? $300? In a way, it seems Bethesda has managed to wreck the value proposition of their own game.  Oh well... this got ranty. Sorry about that."

Sure there were some trusted authors and solid mods, but even then one of the best in the game wound up on shaky ground due to included content.

She took her mods done because she is updating Old Hroldan.  Like really updating it.  If I am remembering correctly, it was suppose to be twice the size of the current mod.  She took her mods down so people would notice her update.  She spent a lot of time updating a mod and no one noticed so she took them all down to get everyone to notice.  It just so happens she took it down a few days before the paid mod thing. She said her mod will be done in about 6 weeks and than she'll reload everything.  edit:  Removed the part where she said her mods would be free.  She just said Old Hroldan would be free.

I'm seeing the word entitled thrown around a lot to describe people who want mods for free but frankly I feel it's the other way around; the people wanting to get paid for their works are the ones who seem entitled, as if their content some how is more important than the years of free content we've had.

modpiracy,349iop,dreapunk,8,Thu Apr 30 03:00:59 2015 UTC,"Modding should never be a paid activity. The moment money is involved all kinds of expectations of quality and reliability are formed. Mods are a nightmare of compatibility as it is. However since they're free, the worst people can get is slightly annoyed that they may not work. If people are buying them and they don't work, well that's a bad situation for the people selling the mods.  The only mods that should be paid for are high quality, thoroughly tested, and supported by the game publisher. I mean if it breaks, you can email Bethesda suppport (or whoever) and get it sorted out. If they can't offer that support but will take a large portion of the proceeds from the mod sales, then it's fucked.  Paid mods are lazier DLC that aren't guaranteed to work. We can never accept paid mods. The future of gaming depends on it."

modpiracy,349iop,Crykeymoses,4,Thu Apr 30 04:12:14 2015 UTC,"The problem was the way it was implemented.  Valve already said they could come back to it, once they work out some kinks.  Starting on a game like TES:Skyrim for example was a bad idea."

modpiracy,34an1u,Thomas-C,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:05:29 2015 UTC,"This might fall under quality control, but my biggest issue with this was how Skyrim mods are so dependent on each other, you might have ended up having to buy 5-10 different mods just to run 1 because of dependencies, for example, random mod -> MCM -> SkyUI -> SKSE, that is 4 mods just to run 1, if all of those had gone pay only, my wallet would be dry very fast.  I wouldn't have a big problem paying for a high quality stand-alone mod that could compare to the official DLC's like Dawnguard and Dragonborn."
modpiracy,34an1u,_mb,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:48:29 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The thing we need to look out for and most likely will happen is a monopolization of mod distribution in the future.  ES6 may very well become fullstop Steam Workshop.  Yes, this means that Valve will up the ante in mod organization and such I'm sure.  But the caveat is that modding WILL become more of a ""everything cost some kind of money because free modding simply doesn't exist anymore due to Steam Workshop"".  That's Bethesda's decision though.  To change the nature of mod distribution entirely.  However, they'd be cutting off their own nose to spite their face if they go with this venture because Skyrim and Oblivion and Morrowind wouldn't last nearly as long as they did if it weren't for the way the modding community does things now.  Change it into a micro transaction thing and as more and more people even buy the cheapest mods, the more prohibitive and less willing people will become of trying mods out, which in effect means that even the money that will be generated will eventually freeze out.  It'll be more about spending 50 cents here, a quarter there, 5 bucks here, and the next thing you know, S.T.E.P is going to become a 600 dollar project.  What mod enthusiast has that kind of money?  All this is going to do is discourage hobbyists and turn modding into a rich kid's game."
modpiracy,34an1u,kontankarite,0,Wed Apr 29 18:28:27 2015 UTC,"In response to your points.  1) Yes, the community would be changed. The question though is still on the table if it would be an overall good or bad change. Change by itself isn't bad, though many people hate it. As for the quality of the mods, I think this is a pretty stupid argument that people use, because there are pretty bad quality free mods as it is.  I think the real argument here is, no one wants to pay for bad quality mods and that paying for mods will just bring even more bad quality mods. However, having more bad quality mods isn't all that of an issue, since the bad ones just tend to be left in the dust much like they already are on Nexus Mods. As long as they improve return policies, this really isn't an issue overall. Also, I am really curious what you think about my argument here, so please do respond, because maybe I am overlooking something.  2) I agree, however, I don't think everyone else may agree. From the sounds of it, there are plenty of people who hate the idea of paid mods in it's entirety.  3) Quality control certainly needs to be worked on. However, I don't think it's impossible to do and I think the community can do it in a manner by selecting either mods or mod authors themselves to be able to put up paid mods. In other words, no one starts out being able to put up paid mods. Not until after the community decides they can. To me .. this would work well, though maybe I am over looking something else.  In other words, if they fix all these issues and try again .. how many people here are going to still fight? If you do ... what will be your reasoning then?  I think some of you seem to forget that the whole reason we won the battle and got them to remove the feature was not because everyone disagreed with the idea entirely but because we just hated the way it was done. This means you will not be able to win the next time if they fix these issues, regardless if you still disagree.  There will not be as many people to sign the next petition, and in the end it will look like a normal internet backlash full of the minority who simply can't accept change.  I am just curious to hear what everyone thinks about that."
modpiracy,34an1u,1sb2gamer,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"The three points are not meant to compliment each other or be compatible with one another entirely; each has its own set of difficulties.  They are the ones most often cited, at least from what I saw during this whole episode.  I'll run through what I can with each.   The first issue is not one which is amenable to ""fixing"".  A community built under the pretense of free distribution and collaboration on content is not the same as a community built under a different set of expectations.  They can create a new community (which appears to be what they have in mind), but they have just been shown the incompatibility of their vision with what has already been established.  It's either start with the idea being present from the beginning, or do not present it.  It isn't that change itself is bad, it's that certain degrees of change are simply too large or too fundamental to be effective in the environment which currently exists.  Sort of like DLC: Horse Armor was dumb as hell, but when games started doing DLC from the get-go, the hubbub over it died fast.  Now it's a standard practice. This is the point of least resistance - assuming paid mods are a future standard, what we've done with Skyrim has shown that the kind of split they originally went for was unacceptable.  Given the lack of any promise that this practice is done for, this is perhaps the point most grounded in the reality of the situation - we'll end up fighting for a fair deal, at the very least.   Quality control is perhaps the most ""fixable"" issue.  There very well could be a way for folks to vet mods before they hit the point of being put on sale.  That happens naturally with people not downloading crappy mods (and the majority of mods aren't good, just like any other creative endeavor - the best rise to the top thanks to being promoted by those who liked them).  The only real danger I'd see here is becoming lax in evaluating mods, or not developing rigorous standards for making it to the marketplace.  Those standards have to be made, though, in anticipation of the content being made, not afterward - as we saw with the mods allowed into the marketplace originally, not having standards means paying for very low quality/poorly designed content.   I'm not sure they can (or want) to fix each problem.  Again, I don't think the first one can be fixed, because it involves factors too fundamentally different, but the other two, perhaps.  If I'm to speculate, it's that they'll do what I alluded to above - simply release a game with this as a feature from the get-go, so that they aren't in conflict with an ""established community"", since that was the primary error they acknowledge committing.  They could likely come up with a fair split of revenue, and a method for controlling quality, and those two would probably be more than enough to make resistance minimal - but there's really no overcoming the idea that the community which grows around it will be different from one which develops under a different set of expectations.  I particularly like what you said about after fixing the problems - there won't be a whole lot of explicitly defined reasoning to put up against the practice if they do.  In which case, we should probably focus on establishing standards which we think are fair, rather than trying to combat the concept."

modpiracy,34an1u,Tivoko,0,Thu Apr 30 00:05:29 2015 UTC,"I'm going to focus on your second point, the issue of paying for mods.   The way I see it the only acceptable payments for any mod should be donations, allowing you the user to support those you believe are worth your money without taking away your ability to try out new mods for free. If we're being honest most mods that are known to be top quality didn't start out that way and it was thanks in part to people being able to download the mod for free and try it out that quality improved as bugs got reported and people suggested fixes or new ideas.  The moment a minimum charge is applied to modding that support from the community diminishes rapidly. Suddenly things go from noticing a bug and reporting it to the author to people getting upset because they paid money for buggy content.   Lots of people can mess around in the creation kit, make a few adjustments to item weights or damage values, change perks and what not but are those worth a minimum price tag, even one as low as 50 cents? I don't think so.  Rather than modders feeling entitled to some form of payment for their work it should be on the consumers end to decide what is and what isn't worth throwing money at.   I view modding much the same as I do twitch streams as there are some very good streamers that are entertaining to watch and they can make a decent amount from subscriptions and donations but they all had to start as just another freebie stream to get there."
modpiracy,3485dh,matyes,57,Wed Apr 29 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"This guy is extremely biases towards and in defense of Valve. He doesn't talk about a lot of the reasons people were upset and why this model was bad for Skyrim in particular. He just keeps repeating the ""people are mad that something that was once free is no longer free"" party line.   As he states, if a mod breaks or has an issue, it's up to the customer and the mod creator to resolve it. Yeah that sounds great.  He's already got my money. Outside of a refund, there's not much I can do.  If I have to get a refund, 1) my gamesave may have just been ganked. 2) The refund goes back into the Steam Wallet and 3) my favorite part, I get a temporary ban from the marketplace. Awesome.   We keep hearing that there is checks and balances for copywrited material but they always mention in the same breath that it's up to the community to police it. Stop blowing smoke up people's ass. When chesko wanted his work taken down because it was using other people's work, Valve refused saying they wouldn't unless they were ""legally compelled to"" . That's an awful lot of doublespeak.   I have nothing against mod creators getting compensated for their work. This however totally reeks of a Valve fanboy coming to the defense of their precious Gabe."

modpiracy,3485dh,ComradeVoytek,17,Wed Apr 29 04:36:23 2015 UTC,"I have said it before and I will say it again. Paid mods will be the death of large mods. Let's ignore the fact that getting legal contracts written for hundreds upon hundreds of people will be expensive and unrealistic for a second and focus on the bottomline:  Anyone who wants modding to become a job will be forced to create a lot of small mods because they WILL earn them more money than their work on large mods.   That means that suddenly, a huge part of the experienced modders will not be candidates for large mod development. Inexperienced modders won't have the skill and what is left is a few dedicated modders but they will inevitably get discouraged and break up as we see time and time again because it will be too much work for them.  If a large mod does get made, you can forget long term support... The 25% just doesn't justify bug fixing on a triple A scale... people are not gonna bother with it (and if it was released for free, people are gonna be exhausted and want to move on anyway)  I work on Skywind and there is no way in hell I am sticking around after release. There may be issues but I simply can't dedicate years and years of my life to a mod after the release... a mod like that relies upon fresh blood to maintain it... and with the standardization of monetization of mods, you can kiss those few helpers goodbye.  I may be wrong, but I highly doubt it. TESRenewal loses most of its new workers month to month.. there has to be constant training and re-training of new people.. voice actors audition but then rarely stick around (because the process is less simple than just recording some lines).  Paid modding works for certain types of games because the mods will always be small scale (skins, weapons, etc). With a game like Skyrim, the process has to be tackled from an entirely different angle and that is something basically all supporters for mod monetization keep forgetting.  TL;DR - Mods the size of Skywind will not happen if mod monetization becomes the standard for skyrim mods .. It just isn't worth doing.  PS: This comment was put together really badly but it is almost 8 in the morning and I haven't slept yet.. so whatever. Keep fighting, pirates!.. there are people trying to justify paid mods but they forget what it will mean for the larger modding projects."

Then more money for the mods that you would have previously gotten for free.  Don't forget DLC as well....  The only plus is that this will bring more people into piracy, which will hopefully bring us closer to our end goal, which is to create a market that doesn't need piracy, though I'm uncertain I'll ever see it.

modpiracy,3485dh,Metal-Phoenix,3,Wed Apr 29 12:13:09 2015 UTC,"""Entitled"" strongly implies that those resources belong to Steam. Like I said on day 1, paid mods are here to stay.   Now that that prediction has been confirmed, let me remind you of the next one: games that require you to pay to unlock the ability to mod.  Why? Because there are too many stupid people paying for these things on ""closed system"" devices. Phones, consoles, etc. These are the people that made microtransactions profitable in the first place. Either that or they're the ones still buying these things. PCs are different in that we have the option open to use to program our own, pirate them, share them and there's absolutely no oversight. There's no one with a finger on a magic button to yank the resource as soon as it's figured out that it's pirated or doesn't something that isn't corporate approved.   What's changing about that? More and more people who were introduced or addicted to the the convenience of those little devices are finding computers. Admittedly, a notable number of them are going to mac. On the visible surface, a mac is a lot like a console or a phone in that it appears closed. (It just isn't a major enough system for people to target their efforts on or just plainly isn't supported enough - it's never really been a gaming platform).  But the ones that go to PC... and the ones that don't care or grew up with DLC and entered into the market with microtransactions see absolutely nothing wrong with this model of doing business. And they're the ones that will be targeted.   Sooner or later, Valve will understand that the only way to really sell this is a closed market like the app store for mac. Approval, magic button deletion, and a support system that makes sure that mods do what they advertise.  Once they roll out the ""Mod app store"", you can be sure that they'll force it no matter what. The only reason that they yanked it is that Skyrim is their cash cow and we totally held that income hostage.   So don't be lulled into a false sense of safety. They'll be back in a matter of months."

The developer or valve need to reach out to specific mods, not allow mods to be submitted to them.  Convenience should be first and foremost. It's not convenient to pay $1 for a sword or an armor set. It is convenient to pay $1 for a group of 10 or so good mods in collections, like an immersion collection or Team Fortress collection or Combat and Magic collection, and have them be downloaded as a single working mod. Be priced appropriately. Does the mod collection add as much content as an official DLC? $5 seems reasonable. Is it just a couple items and a new mechanic? $.50, maybe less. Maintenance responsibility. No idea on a good way to handle the situation of an update breaking a mod or some such, but as it is paid content it should most definitely have a fallback on the developer to fix it in the event the modder otherwise does not. In the event the modder fails to fix the mod, forcing the developer to do such, maybe the modder loses all rights to further revenue generated by the mod?"

The game is $15 not on sale, there's no way I'd pay $1 for an Isaac texture pack or a handful of enemies, it would quickly total more than what the game cost.  The devs are already working on a huge expansion which they said is going to almost double the current content in the game, which it already has a ridiculous amount to begin with.

modpiracy,347fc5,1sb2gamer,11,Wed Apr 29 00:00:12 2015 UTC,"Damn near everything that you pay for has some sort of quality control/regulations or method to support it. If it doesn't, serious problems can arise.   What happens if a mod creator steals content from other mods and sells it? Who is going to go through and slap the seller with a fine? Sure as fuck won't be valve with their (I got my money, you fuckers sort it out) attitude. Every single mod (even free) will have to go through some sort of copyright process to ensure that someone doesn't steal content. You'd have to be blind not to see how this will cut the head off of many creative projects done out of love by someone who already has a real job and doesnt have time to fight these kind of legal battles. What happens when two mods aren't compatible? You paid for both, but fat chance you get the mod creators to work any kind of fix for that situation.  One of the ""selling points"" was that mod creators could make a full time job out of it. Does not seem in favor of people creating mods at ALL if they get 25% of the profits and only if the profits are over $400."
modpiracy,347fc5,orphlax,3,Wed Apr 29 01:51:57 2015 UTC,"Are you replying to me?  If so, I agree. It needs to have quality control. Which is why Valves and Bethesda's implementation was absolutely terrible.  As I clarified in my comment to someone else. When i say paid mods can work, I mean the community decides the mods and which authors are even allowed to release paid mods.  So if people feel a mod like Falkaar deserves it, the communty can vote it to the status of being paid. This of course doesn't mean it can't have a $0 option. I actually think having that option would keep most people happy.  People here however, jump to conclusions when others stick up for the idea of paid mods, and act like it's some how impossible to do, when in reality ... it's really not a bad idea if you just do it right."
modpiracy,347fc5,Kai_Bosh,4,Wed Apr 29 02:07:57 2015 UTC,"They implemented as they did because they cant profit off of mods if they have to hire a ton of people (quality checkers, copywrite lawyers, etc) to look over that kind of stuff. It could be difficult to sufficiently even prove there was wrongdoing. I highly doubt valve is capable of implementing a paid mod system that works.  Valve seems to be a company that does as little as possible to get as much money as possible. See their abysmal customer service, complete silence in response to any problems with their system (incorrectly locked out of using your steam wallet for 7 days? fuck you), the fact that they only actively develop a few games which profit greatly off of microtransactions (some being for user made content).   I think it is a bad idea that is asking for an avalanche of trouble and hostility in the creative modding community."

This is because the mod is a collective effort as mods have always been. Modders, grow more experienced from this feedback and playtesting. We pay for schooling or are unpaid for internship where we learn or gain experience, why should this be any different? Alot of modders who refine their abilities go on to become fully fledged professional developers with lucrative slaries.  ‚Ä¢ Modders who use other modders work or build on other modders work are exempt also because the ssue of who deserves the money will create rifts and is simply unethical.  ‚Ä¢ Copyrighted inellectual property cannot be profitted from as the copyright holders will come down on the modding community, so bye bye batman/masterchief etc (donations may even create issues here).  As you can see, only a small minority of mods could ever actually be viable for pay and those wouldn't be worth the money, having not been playtested.   However providing an option to give something back as gesture for a selfless act by the modder who gets kicks out of creating and providing entertainment is essential. We as a community need to start thinking selflessly also otherwise out great minds will fall prey to those willing to exploit them, who crap over our traditions."

modpiracy,347fc5,1sb2gamer,2,Wed Apr 29 02:57:38 2015 UTC,"I believe that devs should actually do something to incentivize modders to want to create bigger and better mods. In the sense of competitions for things that then perhaps become some sort of paid for DLC, perhaps even collections of community driven mods. Split it like 50/50 if not more towards the modders, however this would mean that modders would have a competitive market to want to create the best high quality stuff, the dev would then be also able to market the modder and his name. I think that could possibly work, mods that are as good as Bethesda DLC's like Shivering Isles and stuff."
modpiracy,347fc5,Roboloutre,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:15:21 2015 UTC,"To that end, I liked an idea that was floated by one of the skywind devs which was allowing modders to take in donations from patreon and similar services.

modpiracy,347fc5,1sb2gamer,3,Wed Apr 29 01:28:45 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%, this was also one of my arguments too. One of the Cities Skylines modder that used to work for Maxis is making a living off of doing this. I was discussing with other game developers about this actually, though not many of them really felt you could earn enough through donations. So I was even arguing with other devs. XD  So crazy enough, many devs believe majority of gamers where against the idea entirely of paid mods. Which ... made the community look bad.

modpiracy,3457lx,Jashin23,6,Tue Apr 28 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"As long as the system isn't shitty this time.  Maybe the Workshop versions are paid, but you can get them free from the Nexus (which would still have the option to donate), so the payment is for the convenience (or a tax on the lazy).  Seems like a better plan; no idea if Steam/Zenimax would agree to it though."
modpiracy,3457lx,AliceTheGorgon,7,Tue Apr 28 22:02:58 2015 UTC,"The only way this works for me is if Bethesda doesn't get a cut at all from any mod.  This is to make sure they never get too comfortable releasing buggy games then getting paid 40% of what a modder makes when he fixes them. That system will lead to shittier games.  Frankly adding a paid feature would reduce the quality of mods. Perkus maximus, Realvision ENB... those mods show what you can really do when there's open and organic sharing occurring in the mod world. With those 2 alone you get over 100 mods compiled into a completely different game visually and in terms of play style. SkyUI, SKSE, BOSS/LOOT, and ENB is required to get them to work fully. If all those went paid, and considering I've donated to all six mods they easily could, then to get a real modding experience I'd bet you'd end up paying an extra $20.  Strictly speaking I'm not against paying for mods, but I'm against the idea that Bethesda deserves a cut. A donate what you want button with 100% of the proceeds to the modder is probably ideal, but even if modders started charging $ Bethesda shouldn't get a cut.  To use the ""You wouldn't download a car"" analogy... Honda/Ford doesn't get a cut when I repaint my car, or if I added rims/nitro or whatever else people do with cars. Why doesn't this mentality translate to games and software in general? Why can't they charge for aftermarket changes unsupported by the parent company? If the modder assumes all liability for support I don't see why it's at all unreasonable to go that route."

Maybe even go full Humble Bundle and allow the buyer to split however they want. A much larger cut for the mod creator (my biggest problem here, 50-60% for the modder and 20-25% each for the dev and Valve is fair imo) Not trying to shoehorn it into a game with such a vast, established modding community (my other major problem here)   If a dev can hit these marks, I'm not against it as long as the option for free mods distributed on unofficial channels remains.

Almost 1 ‚Ç¨ for a sword? That's just ridicolous. I'm willing to give money to those modders that work their asses off and create quality content, like the Skywind guys, not to a teenager whose only work consisted in taking the assets from another game and putting a price tag onto it.

This feels like a hollow victory this battle is not over yet, because I feel like Bethesda is going to roll out something like this with FO4 and TES6 and people will be more accepting because it doesn't breach the momentum that the old games had where they got free mods."
modpiracy,3436im,masterofthecontinuum,3,Tue Apr 28 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, the post only mentions  Skyrim workshop. This indicates that there might be paid mods in future games. We might've won a battle but not the war."

Alas, among the dancing candle-lit silhouettes, there were the few who knew what awaited them in the coming years. For now, their war was over.   Perhaps they could return to their home at long last and enjoy the peace. But they knew better, they knew it was not truly over. For now, they hung up their shadow-scale armor and watcher staves, but they knew that one day, perhaps in another life, they would need to return to arms once more. And when that day came, they would be ready."

modpiracy,3436im,FacialMondays,5,Tue Apr 28 02:12:36 2015 UTC,"Good in the short term, but I can't help but think that it could have been somewhat beneficial if Bethesda hadn't been so unbelievably fucking greedy (you need to pay us for the work you did) and if the system was set to 0 to whatever always. Ie an official donation channel, nothing more.   Oh well. I'm never buying another Bethesda title, and other cunts trying to nickel and dime me like Bethesda did will be treated the same way."
modpiracy,3436im,henrykazuka,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:23:36 2015 UTC,"the game devs don't deserve more than 10-25% of anything. if they made it a 25 25 50 split, with the mod maker getting the 50, then it would actually be reasonable. A donate button is the solution here. It will incentivise people to make quality mods, give incentive to developers to allow mod compatibility, and adequately reward the mod maker for their hard work. everyone wins, and modding becomes stronger through more games with modding options."
modpiracy,3436im,Scheidecker1,3,Tue Apr 28 01:07:54 2015 UTC,"I read a bit on wikipedia, and around 7% royalty seems to be pretty standard. And for the fact that all they (the hypothetical Bethesda in this case) would do is not lift a fucking finger and collect free money that'd be a pretty sweet deal imo. Anything above that and they'd have to make damn fucking sure they're offering something in return. Some QA would be in order, for sure, but we all know that's some black magic voodoo shit Bethesda would never concern themselves with."
modpiracy,3436im,-Jackel-,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:04:51 2015 UTC,"good point. I'm being generous with the partitioning since the idea is to give devs reason to add in mod support. But like you said, they'll be lucky they're getting anything after initial release."

modpiracy,344uqx,shadowkillerx7,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:18:56 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to be more optimistic. SkyUI really got a lot of shit, and now Valve and Bethesda have, as far as I can tell, left them high and dry. Left them holding a big ol' bag of shit.  The community rained down on them pretty hard when the plan was in effect, and their spokesperson responded in kind, but SkyUI isn't the most-endorsed mod for a reason. I think the community should forgive them... as long as they're willing to return to Skyrim modding. If they just take their ball and go home, they deserve all the hate. But if they're willing to put it all behind them, I will take their side and advocate for them, for what that's worth. Probably not much, but I just want to see things back where they were."

(I had seen enough of this from group bands, research groups, etc). There will be time one of the member think his payment does not reflect his works. Just a simple as that can break the team, end their relationship, and worse may lead each member to stab each other.

modpiracy,344uqx,PM_Me_-Anything,3,Tue Apr 28 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"It did, but apparently the map assets were bugged somehow and caused some level of crashing.  I heard someone replaced those assets with the ones from 4.1 and things are a little better.  I have the original 5.0 unzipped on my desktop, but haven't tried it yet. Honestly I'll probably hold out for an official release. I've almost got my mod list where I want it, but I'm still watching a ton of mod reviews before making my merged and bashed patches and really working out the bugs before I, hopefully, get to play a heavily modded game with my new setup... Meanwhile I'll be playing on the failbox for the achievements, haha.  (People rip on the console version, but when your wife has an Xbox and the mods aren't working together, you can get the base game used for about ten bucks on Xbox, and it just works, though the loading screens from Hell are something else. Still, you can exploit the Khajiit chests, gives a player a leg up."

SkyUI, for whatever it's worth, wasn't just some brilliant idea that couldn't have existed without those people that made it.  SkyUI was inevitable.  It could have literally been ANYONE, ANY modder could have made SkyUI.  So SkyUI isn't that special.  But MCM is and always will be.  So for me, fuck SkyUI 5.0.  Take it down, never release it, be mad, or just hold off until the powers that be try this shit again.  But MCM is here and it aint going nowhere.  Even MCM may have eventually existed without those that made it."

It was going to happen because  Skyrim as a PC game actually really needed it to function properly.  My argument is that it didn't HAVE to be the people that made it for it to exist.  It was GOING to be made eventually.  It's not about who did it, but that it was a work that had to be done.  Good on them for making it though.  Who knows how long it would have been for something like SkyUI to come along had it not been for them."

modpiracy,343fm1,gyropathic,6,Tue Apr 28 01:37:19 2015 UTC,"My initial impression is that Bethesda tried to follow Valve's Workshop pricing without following what made Valve's efforts work and somewhat justified their share, namely their strict QA and QCing of contributor efforts in the DOTA 2 workshop. Doing it on a very mature game like Skyrim instead of starting fresh with FO4/TES6 was a easy to spot bad call too I think.  Valve shouldn't be blamed for this per above. I started out anti-paid mod but after debating this and reading the two blog posts I feel that if Bethesda has accepted a realistic share, like 5-10%, given they weren't doing the same amount of work as Valve is in the DOTA 2 Workshop this could have been a good thing. Free modding, and community hub allowed too.  A 70/20/10 split between Modder/Valve/Bethesda. Modders would have to learn they are responsible for QC/QA/Support for taking the lion's share though. Valve or Bethesda would have to step up to do policing of the Workshop,"

modpiracy,343fm1,Dave-C,3,Tue Apr 28 00:44:00 2015 UTC,"The 400 USD threshold(142 USD in my split) had two points.  First, is commercial bank transfers do have costs. Valve giving you your split after every 1 USD purchase is not realistic. Thus lumping it.  Two, it gives people time to catch mod thieves as they don't get the money instantly.  Bethesda got greedy seeing how Valve was working it's Workshop and didn't do the critical thinking on how Bethesda's version was very different with how little they were doing for it."

Notice that the same sites who were pro, were also anti-GG, and those same sites also have serious ethical lapses with the people who write for them.  So there was most likely something that got them to write a pro-article for it.  I'm not saying graft, but something.

It always starts as a harmless slippery slope but somehow every time turns against gaming or freedom of information in the end.   This event has only proved that paid mods will be here. I can't really hate Valve because they are a company. Gamer demographics just happen to be materialistic and clueless. Materialistic as in having to get any stuff, hype about anything, money is just an tool. Clueless as in young and inexperienced, don't know that in gaming industry and life in general voting (with your wallet in this case) and patience works. Don't understand that things will always turn to worse unless you fight. Interestingly the propaganda has been successful over the decades to turn consumer rights into ""developer"" (publisher) rights, donation acceptance being one of them.

It does NOTHING for the community. Playtest, help them fix bugs, create YouTube videos, spread the word on forums. ALL of these are better then throwing a modder a couple of quarters like they're bums.  Modding doesn't need your money. It needs your time. So, shove your money straight up your ass, tempting modders to be change lapdogs. Here modder want a nickel? Here boy. Go make me a skin and you get that nickel. Disgusting. Instilling a habbit of giving money for modding, either before or after download, will simply instill the notion that modders should ask for money. The more they ask; the more they demand.

If they are, that's called addiction and we should not allow addiction to destroy lives and nor should we encourage addiction with chump change. So you're content at being a lazy sack of shit not contributing ANYTHING to the community. Typical. This is how you get paid mods. When you act like a consumer to modders (giving them money), then they will expect you to BE a consumer. That is not a community; that's a business."

You might be contributing to the community, but your sure as hell not contributing to the modders themselves. Everybody loves money man. Just because a modder puts a donation bar, doesn't mean they're a fuckin' crackwhore, sluttin' themselves out for a dime or two. Modders have had donation bars since at least Morrowind. A donation isn't an incentive to create a pay wall, it's an incentive to create better content because a donation is entirely optional.  It's just a poor business move to put a pay wall up for mods, as seen by Valve's paid mod system being removed.   The best modders (IMHO, /u/t3nd0, /u/apollodown, and the rest of the Creation Kids) are adamantly against purchasing mods but they still have donation bars, and they still produce wonderful content."

It's a much more deep and complex problem allowing paid mods than any of these ""game journalists"" and devs on twitter realize.  They look at it on the surface and don't see a problem with it because they don't understand the community, and the complexity of the issues that paid mods presented, because most of them don't participate in it.  Maybe they downloaded a few mods once to try it out, but I doubt these people actually ever get into the nitty gritty and participate with this community or give back to it.

Some people don't even notice, because they don't take the time to look at things beyond just the surface. They want to be the 'hero' and thus, when someone points and shouts ""Enemy!"", they jump, rather than asking ""Is this person really my enemy?  Did they do that which they are accused?"" The 'hero' has no time for such things. They must strike first, else someone else will surely steal the killing blow.  (Ack, I lost my train of thought again and went off on a weird tangent...)"
modpiracy,344al9,4nubis,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:34:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty much nail on head.   Some people foolishly believe the SJ Crowd only target issues of 'Feminism' and 'Equality' but really theyre nothing more than a persistent mob who do as Halfwise said, one prominent 'leader' will point, the rest will jump.  Some do it because they truly believe the accusation, others do it simply because its an easy headline / clickbait.  Also if you read the article correctly, it doesn't state theyre against paying modders, infact thats what the article is complaining about, that theyre not getting paid.  But as usual the SJ Circle don't care about the minutia of issues (such as that modders arent getting paid fairly under the Steam Workshop System), only the overall ""view"". If the SJ crowd were truly for 'social justice' they too would have opposed the workshop payment system as it stood, but as usual, they only glossed over the details.  As for the against the 'old' modding crowd who prefer to be free, well thats because as Halfwise said, theyre not about social justice. They're about selective causes.   They don't bat an eyelid to most causes unless theres money involved.  The same applies to buskers/musicians and indie/youtube D-list film makers. Many of these folks don't get any persistent income for their work, but the SJ crowd don't care there either, because they can't get a slice of the pie all that easily.  TlDR; They agree with the article, not disagree,but their methodology over simplifies things which my or may not be detrimental to the people / groups they claim to protect."

Bethesda or Valve or whatever could actually sponsor these mod authors for their project and we can purchase these things as sanctioned 3rd party DLCs.  Hell, even a team of modders can get together for a brief incorporation and appeal to Bethesda and Valve, pitch their idea, and get the greenlight to produce not just a mod, but an unofficial DLC/mod hybrid with the caveat that the thing is 100% original content outside of the mod community as a whole.  I guess all I'm saying is that I'm not against mod makers banding together to create DLC for games.  They really should do that because personally, I do feel like Falskaar deserved some sort of compensation for how large in scale it was.  But trying to sell a mod that requires yet another mod to actually function properly?  Get the fuck out of here."

That said, this whole thing has pretty much convinced me to get off my ass and finally start switching to only using Libre software.

Deleted most of my proprietary games already, with a few minor holdouts (I have my vices, but I should eventually get bored enough of them to move on), and I'm hopefully not going to need to keep my Windows partition around much longer.  Of course, I was already using GNU/Linux as my primary OS, and there weren't that many games I was looking forward to (they all tend to be somewhat disappointing IMO), so it's not as hard a transition as it could be."

Granted, I don't really have plans to run anything especially 3D intensive, so that may be a non-issue regardless.  My netbook seems mostly fine, except for the touchscreen and some of the advanced touchpad stuff, but that might just be the desktop environment.    Probably the biggest thing is that I'm waiting for is to hear back from the FSF about this: https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-964674.html  glibc is supposed to be fully lgpl, but the gentoo package system has listed several other licenses as also applying to bits of it for a few years.  I sent the FSF an email last night asking if that's just a gentoo thing, or what. There are other libc implementations that use pure FSF approved licenses though, so worst case scenario I could get a custom gentoo install running and compile everything with with musl or uClibc or something.  Edit: musl is MIT, not lgpl. My bad."

The reality is that larger mods that have a larger modding team have different people doing different things.   Say you had 5 people on the team, one person gets paid, from there, how does that person split up the funds? Do you pay them all 20% even though a couple of those people, one did 3% of the work, another did 12% of the work -- is it fair to give them a full share? And what if one of them thinks they are entitled to more? Divvying up the funds without causing a legal battle due to a butthurt team member would be insane. The model just isn't viable for large teams.  Now for a single or pair of authors, this model could be viable for making a large, DLC style mod, but not a huge team like Beyond Skyrim for instance.  How many big name bands have broken up over money? Hahahahahaha."

Later on in the conversation   ""There is a chance that someone will made a paid mod that builds on Skywind, it may actually be someone within the Skywind team""   And one person said   ""If that happens I'm going in, tweaking tiny parts and re-uploading it for free""   But yeah, it's a good talk.

I'm against the whole paid mod thing myself of course, but money is money, we can't blame some of the modders so hards.   That being said, when they are ignorant as hell about the thing and act like it's something to be hyped about (SkyUI), then yeah the modder is at fault."
modpiracy,33ztiz,CapControl,5,Mon Apr 27 10:50:04 2015 UTC,"I'm conflicted on whether or not to really blame them, to be honest. They're taking a deal that inherently acknowledges Bethesda and Valve as being more deserving of a reward for their work than they are. Desperation, however understandable, doesn't excuse them from promoting a deal that shafts everyone.  That, and part of me wants to say that if you're really desperate for money, making mods for skyrim is not a wise choice for drumming up quick cash, unless you're already one of the majorly popular authors. Even then, as I said, you're still hurting everyone else by setting such a shitty standard for compensation."

Modders should mod because they love it. If you're so hung up on giving back, then actually contribute to the mod scene. Playtest, fix bugs, create their websites, create video.

Skyrim is three years old. That is reached 98% three and a half years after it came out is high praise. If it goes down, it won't rustle Bethesda's jimmies much, if at all.

I just wanted to add that even when you look at this through a business/financial viewpoint (although I believe we should fight for our philosophical viewpoint), it still doesn't make sense!  As soon as you monetize something, it becomes a product, and you become a businessperson selling me that product. A free mod doesn't come with any expectation that it will be bug-free, compatible, or have updates, but a product has no such luxury. If a modder wants to turn their creations from community gifts to products, they'll have to ensure it's bug-free, compatible with other mods, provide support for their customers and regularly update it, which will end up requiring more work and money than the mod itself!  And when these businesspeople inevitably fail to reach those expectations, consumer trust will go down to the point where no one is willing to pay for any mod. Paid mods, or as I like to call them, Third Party DLCs, are a time-bomb that will self-destruct and bring the entire modding community down with them."

modpiracy,33z0va,krackers87,0,Mon Apr 27 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"As far as Early Access mods go, I'd have to say that's just a buyer beware thing that will require some self control and willingness to refund to avoid.  For DRM, having that second layer of DRM for content within a game is more complex from a technical standpoint than you think. If it wasn't then it wouldn't be so easy to pirate official DLC, especially for games like skyrim where you can just install DLC like a mod as long as you can source the files themselves. Also, DRM has been on the out for a while, I don't think this will somehow spur a comeback in that department. Especially since the whole ""pay what you want"" which was spawned as part of the backlash to anti-drm has been promoted in this instance, signifying a move further away from that line of thinking.  Technically there was nothing preventing popups in the past, begging for donations until somebody puts in a donation code or some shit. Also, considering what happened to the dude who did that, its prob not going to catch on. If you haven't noticed, most mod makers or game devs don't like being despised.  There will always be shitty people doing shitty things, but the key here is that the massive amount of competition that can exist in the marketplace, should help to keep a constant flow of better options available.  Nobody failed to speak out against any of that nonsense. Most people did and it happened anyways. Greed will always exist in every aspect of society. The result was a massive shift towards the indie game scene and away from the transacting out the ass big games. Because thats how you improve a situation, by giving people more access and providing stepping stones for those who have nothing but a great idea, to bring that idea to fruition without needing massive capital, a barrier which restricts the flow of new content. Yeah it sucks that sequels to games I loved are tainted by that nonsense, but this isn't exactly new to me. Maybe the reasons for sequels or new games being shitty are different now than they used to, but I remember when some games sucked just the same.  You know what is awesome now though? There's a new game I want to play and end up enjoying, almost every other week. I remember when I used to wait for a game to release, something I was excited about, it came out and sucked dick or wouldn't work for one reason or another. No refund, 50$ down the drain, and months to wait for the next interesting title. I never thought back then, I'd ever get to the point where I'll literally be unable to play all the good pc games (forget about even including consoles) that exist because there's new ones released faster than I can finish them. I don't have to care about Assassins Creed 5, I enjoyed the first, never got time to play the next couple and since, have found countless other titles to keep me fulfilled.   Some history: (In terms of options) A List of All PC gmaes released in 2004 http://www.game-debate.com/games/index.php?year=2004  I counted about 200. A handful, maybe 20-30 or so decent games, a whole lot of shit. Cabela's big Game Hunter? Nicktoons Basketball? Bad Boys 2? Fuck man.... if you picked the right date you could sell some real shit, simply because there were no other new games to speak of, especially if you picked a more desperate genre.  On steam alone, I counted about 36 new games in the past two days. And I would say at least the same ratio of shit to good, if not better. Granted, I would have to meta critic all those games on the pc list to really get a specific ratio and compare fully acurately, but its hard for me to look at that PC list, look at the steam new releases, and say we are worse off now.  Also keep in mind, a lot of those games people think of fondly now, like Ground Control II and Nexus the Jupiter Incident (two I'm familiar with), got shitted on vehemently in their time and failed as a series shortly thereafter.  Some more history: (In terms of mods and playing them in older games)  Load up a copy of the Old Dawn of War, install one of the total conversions, then try to play with two other friends and prepare to pull your hair out all day trying to figure out what caused you to desync every match after 10 minutes. Have fun reinstalling both base game and mod over and over, trying to get things stable. I literally, just weeks ago, lived through this very nightmare that reminded me what hell it was to get most multiplayer games to just work right before steamworks. Granted I also remember the first few years of Steamworks when they first forced HL1 and CS over to the new system, and the hell that was, but hey, progress.  Final bit of history: In response to this portion: ""They'll eventually discover they can make more money off of this community mod market and expend more effort into releasing an official modding tool to release alongside their ""game"" instead of working on official content for it.""  You mean as opposed to what they already do a lot of times, which is lock modders out from touching most of the game in the first place, so the dev/pubs have exclusivity to releasing new content for the game? Or just never develop mod tools in the first place, leaving the game to die unless lucky enough to be sequel'd  Dawn of War II - Locked out of more than simple edits and map making, thanks to Relic/THQ being pissed how modders created the additional races for the old DOW.  MechWarrior 4 - Never was modable, but a part of the community figured it out (MekTek), they never released the tools to the public, keeping exclusivity to developing mods for MW4 (this may have been due to MS's request, I'm not familiar with the exact reasons why). Later ceased and desited themselves, presumably due to MWO. If there was avenue for Microsoft to have a steady revenue stream from that game, it would prob still be alive today. Also MW Living Legends may have stood a stronger chance of surviving, but that's a bit more complicated due to it's own circumstances.  Supreme Commander 2 - This was a god damn shame, because the massive performance boost the engine offered, would of been perfect for some Forged Alliance total conversions. Alas, no money in it, and Square/Enix isn't so generous a company to support such a thing if it doesn't benefit them directly.   StarCraft 2 - Forced all custom maps into a series of strict requirements set by Blizzard, censored by Blizzard and limited in the # of maps you could create by Blizzard. Yeah you can find sites where you can download maps outside of the in-game arcade system, but good luck playing with anyone online with those.  I can come up with more examples, but those are some particularly heartbreaking ones."

modpiracy,33xei0,TheAmazing_OMEGA,0,Sun Apr 26 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"It should probably have a ""recurring payment"" option too, so that it's easier to keep supporting the mods you especially like. And maybe whenever you remove/add mods it could prompt you to redistribute the sliders.  Hopefully such a system could/would also be used to support base games too, with the code and art and such being released under GPL and CC style licenses. Well, I can dream anyway. It would probably be a while before that kind of thing became anywhere near common."

Metadata of coarse can be manipulated, and the agent might have been lying (about either/both). I was under the impression it wasn't a good photo (didn't actually see it), so whether or not it was her was actually in question.

I would actually consider paying for mods on the workshop IF - they have (either individually, or collectively as a bundle) an equivalent amount of content and price to the official DLCs, AND since Bethesda is getting a chunk of the coin, they would have to officially support any paid mods (or mod bundles) available.   That said, every mod that is currently available is either absolute shit, incredibly overpriced for the amount of content it adds, or both.   They did not put their best foot forward on this one."

modpiracy,33x45w,thesurdin,18,Sun Apr 26 14:56:57 2015 UTC,"They said they spent years on this paid mods concept. I don't think it's going anywhere but I'm hoping the backlash continues to grow and not dissipate like with Early Access titles, Pre-Orders, Excessive DLC, Macrotransactions in full-fledged $60 titles, Devs who abandon a project and say they'll let the community finish it through the Workshop, etc.  I don't think this is going away or if it does it'll just keep getting reintroduced to it in a new form like the CISPA bill. When it is finally accepted though all we can do is boycott the titles and devs that support this sort of thing while countless others continue to purchase it regardless.   They're going to say it's not that bad and you should support the devs but they're not looking at this in the long-term. Think of all the shady practices this is going to open up. We already had the devs of Spacebase-DF9 say a game is finished while in Early Access and leave it up to the players to complete it through mods. We've already seen that they're bundling mods for close to $30 right now for Skyrim. What's to prevent them from making a Paid Mods Season Pass later on? If mod piracy becomes a big enough issue for them that it eats into profits, who's to say Steam won't implement their own proprietary DRM on mods and close out access to mods you try to install elsewhere. We've already seen Early Access Paid Mods too after less than a day of this being announced. For those that say ""You don't have to buy this"" they're not looking at the Big PictureTM here. This is going to change the entire industry and the way they sell games in the future. It's going to end up very similar to the mobile gaming market where all those microtransactions got out of hand except this time it'll be for unfinished games left intentionally unfinished because they can make more profit out of the paid mods made by the community than expending effort to complete it.  Let's look at what their counter-argument is going to be. ""It's going to allow us to focus resources into releasing an official modding tool that everyone is able to use and collaborate to make great content!"" They just realized they can make more money off of community-generated content than making content on their own so they throw together a quick mod tool like this and reap in the profits from us. What's worse is that you probably won't even be able to release any of the content unless they give you the word to giving them final say over what is allowed to be seen by the community. If you don't comply with their rules they can just as easily slap you with a DMCA notice."

modpiracy,33x45w,jusmar,5,Sun Apr 26 23:09:35 2015 UTC,I do too. Tabletop Sim and Hand of Fate were really great titles in EA but that doesn't discount the 85% of EA titles that never see full release or get abandoned in some way. There is at least some form of quality control with EA titles as you can just check out and see if the team behind it are competent. But with community modders it's a completely different story.

modpiracy,33x45w,mully1234,33,Mon Apr 27 10:44:31 2015 UTC,"Boycotting one sale alone isn't going to really hit them where it hurts: nothing less than completely cutting them off as far as your spending habits go is going to send a worthwhile message. Already wiped my wishlist and'm about to poke around and see if I can wipe my payment data as well so I have another barrier against impulse purchases. Not a single fucking cent from me in the future, this is the last fucking straw on the shitheap of Greenlight and Early Access and the castrated Keywords clusterfuck."
modpiracy,33x45w,ParasitusGubermintus,16,Sun Apr 26 14:21:42 2015 UTC,"The reason I say this will hit them where it hurts is because they make the most money during a sale. Of course we won't spend money up to that point, but I think losing out on a whole sale's worth of profits is our first real chance of making them pay for this on a large scale."
modpiracy,33x45w,AliceTheGorgon,2,Sun Apr 26 14:25:51 2015 UTC,"and'm about to poke around and see if I can wipe my payment data as well   If you (or anyone else) haven't found it yet, you have to go to your account settings, then the transaction history and games owned list, and ctrl-f ""payment"" on that page to find the saved payment methods (on the right side of the page and down a bit). There should be some small text right near that that says ""remove"" or some such.  As for the topic, this has convinced me to abandon Steam entirely. First there was the shitty offline mode for ages, then the shitty way Greenlight was handled, then the absolute lack of curation of Early Access, then flooding the store with shitty, no effort, games, and then we get this? Goodbye Steam.  (There is one early access game I've got that I'll have to keep Steam around for, for a while, as the Humble Store version lags behind on the updates. I'll probably contact the devs and ask about getting that resolved.)"

modpiracy,33x45w,Robotick1,6,Mon Apr 27 21:48:10 2015 UTC,"few thoughts;   Do you honestly think that the portion of people upset about this will even make a dent in steams profits big enough to notice? I don't. In what way would this let valve know? Even if there was a noticable dip, do you think they're going to believe it when some random reddit goers start shouting ""that was for the mods!"". Steam Sales don't really have much in common, if you want to get your point across you have to make a stink closer to the problem you want fixed. What incentive do i have to forfeit cheap games when the only benefit is maybe being part of a group knocking half a percent (optimistic) off valves gross profits for a sale period. Why should i miss out with nothing to show for it other than some smug idea that i stuck it to valve?"
modpiracy,33x45w,Robotick1,6,Sun Apr 26 15:36:57 2015 UTC,"1) I think you underestimate how many people are upset about this. Not all of them are constantly posting their outrage.  2) Not if it's just reddit, but if we post on their facebook, their forums, their twitter, their email inbox we can get the poiint across.  3). Again, a lot of other sites typically run comparable sales during the same period. And if this doesn't work, there will be another sale a few months later.  I of course hope it doesn't actually come to this and this is all sorted out before the sale."
modpiracy,33x45w,Robotick1,0,Sun Apr 26 15:44:14 2015 UTC,"The logistic are just too complicated for it to work.  There are millions of steam user. Even if every people in this thread spend 6 hours each day trying to spread the word, our impact would be very small. Also, there is no guarantee that other people will do it simply because we said it. The only way would be to force them by DDoS the steam/Valve server during the sale, which I do not approve of.  I think you are underestimating the number of people that dont care about this issue.  In the end of the day, we need to individually take a stance and vote with our wallet. We cant control other people action, specially not on the internet."

modpiracy,33x5t4,JustGetFun,7,Sun Apr 26 21:06:02 2015 UTC,"Story time!  I've modded for a variety of games in my time. Some of the games I've worked with include minecraft, wildstar, skyrim, guild wars 2, dragon nest, and killing floor. Some of my mods are public, most aren't. In total, I've probably gotten around 2-3000 downloads of mods. Not a lot, surely though definitely more than some.  Now, not all of my mods are public, and I'd likely have had more if they were, but I know modders for games who were happy about hitting double digit downloads.  I have been asked by my users to put a donation link up. In my career as a modder, I've made a whopping total of $2 USD. Two people each donated one dollar. Now, I'm not complaining, I'm not in it for the money (often I mod simply because I want the game to be a bit more perfect for me), and I'm also not going to claim all modding communities are the same, and some probably do donate more than others, but I laugh at any claim that an average modder can make money in the craft. If I charged for the mods that were downloaded even $1 and only received a tenth of the downloads, even with the 25% I would have made significantly more (save the thing I heard about valve withholding money until you earned x amount, of course).  Whether or not more people are donating now, I do not know. Perhaps they are as a means of protesting this Valve business, but that donation set up surely won't last, and it will inevitably return to the vast, vast majority not donating as this all blows over."
modpiracy,33x5t4,headlessgargoyle,2,Mon Apr 27 02:45:45 2015 UTC,"True, but I suppose it does equate to, slow drip of pennies, or random bulk donations.  For most of the modders who think theyre going to earn ""more"" though, I think theyre in for a shock. Perhaps initially, in the first wave boom they -might- as we saw with TF2 items & trading, but it will soon peter out and they'll find their income dwindle again.  After all you said it yourself;  If very few people were willing to donate, do they really think making it a forced payment fare any better?   I reckon all theyre going to see is either a reduction in downloads or it being used as a donation system anyway with them STILL offering a free download outside of steam."
modpiracy,33x5t4,JustGetFun,2,Sun Apr 26 21:09:48 2015 UTC,"Imo the problems are :   old system : modders couldn't sell their mods and make real money out of it. new system : if Valve keeps the new system as it is (no verification, horse genital mods, 2$ cosmetics for an already paying game, no support, early release mods...) then the free mod community will slowly die (most modders will try to get a couple $ out of their mods) and eventually only garbage mods will be available.   Edit : formatting."
modpiracy,33x5t4,headlessgargoyle,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:26:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your assessment of the free modding community. There's a few reasons why, and I'll go into em.  As a general rule, the vast majority of mod developers are novices. Just learning to play around with modding or maybe even entirely new to computers as a whole. These people will almost guaranteedly not charge for their mods.   One reason is they probably won't value their own work highly enough. They might accept donations if it comes their way. I might see an argument that if all mods had a baseline of $1, these devs might charge the same. However, we've seen the backlash, and the likelihood of the entire community switching to paid mods is, in my personal opinion, extremely small. I don't see this group really affected at all by this except in one admittedly fringe case- if all mods move towards professional quality, novices may be scared to contribute after realizing the work that goes into it. I would personally hate to see this happen, but I don't see it as extremely likely either.  Sadly, most modders don't get past this stage either, they just stop after one or two mods and move on to the next game on their list. If we're lucky, they get a passion for it and either continue making mods in whatever new game they're playing, or move on to make a career out of it.  The next group of modders mod out of passion and experience- these people are basically just game developers not paid by the studio. They're the type of people responsible for things like the unofficial elder scroll patches. They love the game, and they want to see it better. Often, these are the people who take on the really heavy projects. These mods are often professional quality, complete with documentation, detailed changelogs, and everything we'd expect from our favorite game studios. These people might charge for their mods, so long as they deem it worth it with respect to their audience (as in, they can do so without massive public backlash type thing). They might also specifically not charge for the mod on the ground of principle. While these people will certainly think about the choices they make and why they make them (especially with regard to charging), in general they won't disappear. Some experienced modders have already decided to leave, and that is a shame, but I think most won't."

The problem is that this kind of modder, the one who makes high quality mods, are receiving close to no donations because 99,5% of the players act like cheapskate and think they are entitled to free and high-quality mods because they already bought the game.  If players are not willing to donate to support the hardworking modders, players should not expect good mods to be free forever either.  This behaviour is why we are now getting the paying mods, and this will hurt the creation of the small and free mods."
modpiracy,33x5t4,ecstatic_waffle,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:26:12 2015 UTC,"Now hold, I agree with your general assessment that we're seeing this change because people have been unpaid for their work for too long, but this isn't strictly about entitlement either. There are plenty of valid reasons surrounding this entire issue.  1) Some believe that this is Bethesda double dipping or that Bethesda and Valve don't deserve the money (even though that's not how royalties/licensing or distribution/server storage work at all in any other industry). These people often have issues over the percentage the modder is getting- which I can respect. But considering that percentage is greater than 0 overall, and considerably larger than other industries giving between 5 and 15%, I'm pretty okay with it (and I say this as a modder). The OP posted a critique comparing the cut a game engine takes to the cut steam/bethesda takes. This is not a fair comparison for the amount of work that goes into their respective development. While some mods certainly take time to develop (USKP, SkyUI, etc), the vast majority of mods take a week or two total. Game development from the ground up often takes years for solid final products.  2) Some believe that Valve doesn't have reasonable infrastructure to handle this system. Personally I agree, Valve needs to step their game up here.  3) Some believe that you can't adequately research mods before buying them. I have a tendency to disagree here, between user reviews, the developer's description, and any pictures or videos, you're given a relatively complete look at what it should offer and what it does offer. Of course, if any of these are missing then you might not be  given that look- at which point I say be a responsible consumer and don't buy the mod. There are thousands (if not millions) of mods that never see the light of day just because the modder doesn't feel like it's worth publishing- you should probably get used to the idea of not having every mod in existence. Paid mods may also start to offer older versions for free (such as SkyUI did when they attempted to go for a paid model) allowing for people to have a ""demo version"" in some form.  4) Some believe because historically speaking mods haven't been charged for until the point they basically reach a game of their own (Dota, KF, the like), the majority of mods shouldn't charge until they reach that point either. I can understand the point, and understand that history sets current expectations, but that does inherently mean that 99% of modders will never see real money for their work which to me is a problem.  5) Some, like you, believe that the introduction of paid mods will somehow cause damage to other mods. I'll admit, I don't really understand this. In general (note, not what you've said) I've seen this argument as an all-or-nothing argument, such that all mods will either switch to being paid mods or none will. This is of course fallacious. Some modders will of course switch over to a pay model with mods that weren't always such, others won't. Eventually the market will reach stability with some % free, and some % paid, and a considerable portion of the % paid probably with only a few total downloads. In all likelihood, I see this as leaning rather heavily towards the free side, if for no other reason than this public backlash. If you could explain why you feel that paid mods will hurt the creation of small mods, I'd be happy to hear it.  At the very least, these concerns are deeper than just entitlement to free stuff, though as pointed out I believe the majority of these concerns can be solved by either accepting control over what you can (ie, your money), or releasing control over what you can't (ie, other people charging for mods). The Valve concerns are rather serious though, so I respect those."

The split is currently 30% to Valve, the rest to the developer and it is up to the developer if they decide to let the modders have any percentage of that revenue. Beth settled at 25% for the modder.  Its because of this set up, that makes it bad for modders. At any time the developers can decide to go 0% to the modder and keep the 70% for themselves."

There's also no guarantee that you'll be getting a quality product when you plop down a few bucks to buy one of these mods.

To replicate the brawl bug, make sure that some of your needs require tending; Moderately hungry or slightly thirsty, for example. Then while you're in the brawl, wait until iNeed gives you an update on your needs condition, by turning on the sound effect or whatever.

modpiracy,33x5jr,Lyratheflirt,10,Sun Apr 26 17:41:21 2015 UTC,"Essentially when you download a file, you're downloading it from a server. But suppose you want to download something that no server has, say illegal content or stuff that is just no longer hosted because it's so old.  This is where torrenting comes from. A torrent is a download, but instead of downloading from one place, your torrent client (please don't use uTorrent, try something else like Deluge instead) will send out feelers for other people who are hosting (or seeding) the stuff you want to download. Theoretically, what will happen is that each person who has this file you want will send you bits of it at a time so that it gets to you as fast as possible. So the more seeders you have, the faster your file should download.  Once you're done downloading the file, you join the banks of seeders and can provide the same content to other people. Someone who shuts off the torrent and thus doesn't join the seeders is called a leech or a leecher and are generally frowned upon by the torrenting community.  Torrenting is a great way to share content with other people without having to host the content on a file server or jump through hoops to make sure what you're doing is legal.  In the case of most torrents, people don't care if it's legal or not."

I literally only bought Skyrim because of SkyUI (I waited an entire year before knowing that I could play the game with a different interface), and the idea of giving bethesda money for something that was their shortcoming in the first place, is disgusting."

VALVe gave the team an agreement to sell it, use Half-Life's name, and take 75% of the revenue from the devs and share sales for using Steam as a service, blah blah blah. The devs for the mod slated full-release are working on making completely new textures that do not rely on some of the more bland and pixely ones from the Source Engine that they used. On the forums, the team occasionally releases little snippets of what they were doing.  The team also stated that if things got out of hand (the community being stupid and flaming them for example) that they would no longer be doing little previews. So if the previews are no longer updated, this likely happened.  So, short answer: It's under development.  As for VALVe, I'll agree. Their recent business changes have been really disheartening for me to handle. For me, seeing VALVe attempt to change the PC gaming world for the better, then just kind of stabbing it in the back with such utter hypocrisy is just... well, it would be like walking in the bedroom and finding your spouse cheating on you. I used to have only good (and sometimes critical criticisms) to say about Gabe and VALVe as a whole. With this event and how they have handled TF2, DotA 2, and CS: GO, turning them into a series of box opening simulators, then just stabbing us HL fans by saying that they're basically done with it...   It's made me lose so much faith in the industry now that I don't even want to develop games. Which sucks for me. Because companies like Blizzard and VALVe used to be so awesome that it inspired me to want to develop games! I wanted to work for VALVe and help push the industry in the right direction... especially since EA/Activision/Ubisoft are so actively trying to dismantle it.  Sorry about the tirade rant.

I'm hoping someone starts up a new distribution service over this year. Basically do right what VALVe has done wrong over the past 5 years. Would be good for everyone.

This is exactly what happened to independent games increase in quality: systems were put in place that were easier to monetize.  From what I've seen, very few entirely free mods have stood out to me for skyrim.  I'm interested to see what will be developed following more direct and widespread avenues for monetization.  Game development and modding go hand-in-hand.  They are both similar avenues of work, as the case of good modders sometimes going on to be developers.    Does anyone have any contrary opinions?  Do you think independent development would have increased in both quality and quantity had easily available revenue options not been established?  Do you think this can not also happen to modding, which by definition is essentially independent development?"
modpiracy,33vc6n,leagueplanet,27,Sun Apr 26 07:26:59 2015 UTC,"Money being involved in modding will not lead to higher quality mods, its happened in several communities before, GTAIV, Minecraft, and its all lead to disappointment because it creates a competitive environment. Competition isn't needed between mods. What we will see is a blackmarket arise, like the reddit we are currently in to pirate mods solely due to the fact that people aren't willing to hand out 75% of the money they pay to Valve and Bethesda.  Games have to be competitive with each other, because they are an actual company trying to sell, however modding only has a bad history when money is involved, we won't see an increase in quality or quantity especially in the terms of Steam Workshop because there is no obligation to upkeep the mod. What we will see is people abuse the system by writing mods that simply run console commands and use it to basically scam people into buying it.  Suddenly overnight all the mod developers are starving or something, we have been mod developers that have been missing for years suddenly come back because they had money, what this has shown is that the modders are actually greedy to the fact they are willing to sell their mods only getting 25% of the cut because they are so desperate for money.  Most of the community has already said we would be willing to donate if it was optional, but any developer that jumps to Steam Workshop for the paid mod section won't receive donations. There are literally studies that prove that work quality decreases when money is involved, not the other way around."
modpiracy,33vc6n,Boilrig,-10,Sun Apr 26 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about minecraft.  The best server mods I've seen have been paid ones.  My friend runs the server daegonner and owes the thousands of dollars he makes per month and the high quality to the mods that are only made possible because the mod developer has an income source.  This is true for other servers, too.  While these are server sided mods, it's a multiplayer game.  As far as client side mods, very few have wow'd me from the absolute finesse and skill that went into the aforementioned server mods.    In fact, in a discussion about a specific single player mod in MC, he said modding is bloated with a lot of people without exceptional talent and wishes he could invest time into making a singleplayer mod that would knock everything else out of the park, but he doesn't have the time/resources.  I tend to agree with him.  Sure, some mods are good as a hobbyist, but right now there is nothing to attract true exceptional talent to modding, or in some cases that exceptional talent can't afford to spend all their time modding.  The upkeep of a mod is inherent, because in order for more profit to be acquired, it must be updated.  Because both game publisher and modder will be profiting from sales, there will be a level of communication regarding updates.  This is just like mobile app devs being in contact with platform devs on keeping things running smoothly after an update (sometimes apps break after a mobile software update).  It is exceedingly clear what mod you are getting from the description, comments, pictures.  People will mostly avoid what you entail the ""scam"" mods.  I seriously doubt low quality will be pushed to the top.  Steam has rather good formulas for determining high quality content based on purchases and ratings.  Sorry, but people are not willing to donate as much as you say.  Only 500 dollars was donated to SkyUI after 9 million downloads.  Those studies are taken out of context and often misinterpreted -- I've yet to see free software made out of the kindness of the devs hearts that competes with the likes of proprietary products Like Adobe After Effects.  I feel like I'm describing the benefits of proprietary content in general.  The only reasonable qualms should be that of compatibility, which insofar Bethesda has been good at keeping mods compatible."
modpiracy,33vc6n,Chawklate,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:26:20 2015 UTC,"The community understands the logic of paid mods when it comes to multiplayer games, allowing you to split your servers from the others, but this is Skyrim, one of the most modded games of all times and its single player. The thing is that modding is hobbyist, but the thing that pushes the people to make huge mods is experience into the industry. As we have known a few have been hired into companies mostly due to the quality of work they did on their mod.  The thing is, the upkeep of a mod doesn't need to exist in this situation, as there is no obligation, you are taking the money and running, there is no legal obligation to fix any of the mods. We also have to consider the 25% profit which most modders and game devs have disagreed with. As this is Steam Workshop, we will most likely see a ton of shit burying the good mods, and knowing the average consumer, they will continue to purchase regardless which ruins the entire system that shouldn't of existed in the first place.  The studies are true, and it has happened to other modding communities, the thing is, I've never seen SkyUI complain before, but here they are out of retire and to quote the dev ""It's just money"". There is a difference between Adobe After Effects and modding, one is a company, and one is a edit of a product that is owned by someone else. What the problem is that this sets a precedent to other gaming companies to allow a continuous income off the backs of modders. Once again, many of the community would rather have a pay what you want, with the ability of $0, as this removes a lot of risk and also allows users to actually test the compatibility past 24 hours and donate then."
modpiracy,33vc6n,leagueplanet,0,Sun Apr 26 05:24:46 2015 UTC,"This is a chance for modding to move beyond ""hobbyist"".  Modding's final resting place certainly isn't going to just be ""experience"" for the top modders.  There isn't an official obligation, but there is a clear motivator.  Boris Continuum isn't obligated by law to update after Adobe After Effects updates.  They are obligated by continuing to have their product sold (Boris is essentially a mod of AE, btw).  I doubt a broken mod would remain high up, because if Valve has any experience with systems like this, it weighs in the amount of refunds on the results.  More goes into complex mods than you give credit for.  It is not simply an edit, it is essentially game development.  Whether you are creating game assets, scripting complicated events, it is extremely close to game development for high quality mods.  The studies are true, yes.  It is misinterpreted though because money is required to live.  You can pay someone to work longer than they would for free.  At some point they need to stop and make money.  I could hire 2 talented game devs at 50 dollars an hour, and in 4 months time we could make a mod on skyrim that would absolutely put all the others to shame.  That example is rather on the high end, but it really explains the point of how money can facilitate bigger and better mods.  I don't know much about SkyUI's situation, the reason I said that was because people don't donate all that often.  I'm all for paying what you want starting at 0, but I suspect the modder won't be in for a good time if they except to make as much as if they charged for it."
modpiracy,33vc6n,Chawklate,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:39:13 2015 UTC,"I understand this is a chance for modders to move into a hobbyist kind of position. But we already have system, its called Patreon, and it works really really well. It may appear to be a clear motivator but gaming mod communities have basically proved time and time again that it doesn't work.   The thing is with Boris Continuum is that it has a reason to update as its actually a mod of an actual program that is used which is actually not even close to a game. The thing is trusting Valve to remove other peoples stolen and a ton of broken mods fast enough which will probably not happen since they don't want to do an inch of work towards Quality Assurance.  The Studies are true, however, as some basically quoted ""Suddenly every modder is starving or something"", modding and living don't actually fit together, and they haven't for 15 years. At some point yes, they need to stop and make money, by getting a job since game modding itself isn't really a job at all, and all of a sudden some are declaring it a job when it really isn't.  Yes, you could hire 2 devs at $50 an hour, and make a mod, however there is no guarantee it is a good mod at all, and due to the communities reaction to this I doubt you will be able to sell it at a high price, then you also have to consider piracy. One of the main points of that is that people are unwilling to buy your mod simply because you are only receiving a 25% cut and they don't believe in the Bethesda and Valve cut.   There are people who will do a good job, but more often than not, we will see more abuse this system that do good. The SkyUI situation is mostly around the guy disappearing for 2 years, reappearing and start making comments ""It's only money"", to long time supporters of the mod who learned that in a couple of weeks they will have to pay for the next big update for the mod. All the community wants is a choice, if developers don't have a 0 as an option, you will most likely see it pirated. If they believe it is worth it, they will select the 0, test it out and if they do like it, most likely find a link that will give you 100% of the donation.  If mod developers expect that they will get money, because they are cashing in on a 15 year long system of free mods, they have another thing coming."

Remember those disclaimers that mod authors use to put ""I am not responsible for any damage done to your save file"", well now they can't if they sell it."
modpiracy,33wh1x,zbzszzzt123,8,Sun Apr 26 08:22:27 2015 UTC,"Is this enough to make valve's stupid new system backfire? Will people feel scammed that they bought 5 combat overhauls and they don't work together? The average modder has 5 mods that they got of the workshop, they have no idea how load order works or what a bashed patch is. Once these people feel cheated they will turn on Valve and won't make the mistake of buying stupid shit for fallout 4.....but then again, there's always people who just love spending money."
modpiracy,33wh1x,--treandoge--,11,Sun Apr 26 12:52:01 2015 UTC,"This actually why making skyrim a testing field is a bad idea, not only is it a spider's web of community regarding mod dependencies and credit assignment, it is also a game prone to save file corruption and crashing if not handled with care and skill, which I doubt 90% of SW users have.   Is steam actually started with another game, say torchlight or orc must die where most changes are cosmetic and the game modding tool does not allow such extensive changes, the feedback might not be that bad.  Of course, this is all said assuming it is actually okay in the first place to charge people for mods, which is heavily debated"

You would have to ask and provide details to have them set it up for you. I find this entitled and ostentatious. Place your own donation button in the description.   Nexus supports modders as a platform service - an organized place with tools, searches and discussions. It's a free service. But a business that needs revenue. And you would complain because something is convenient for them? Really, there are no ""good people"" but to go to such an extreme over a button...

They need a certain level to maintain service, and dividing revenue between ALL mod authors results in silly minute payments. (0.00002p)  They can't offer a slice of ad revenue to only the Top 25/50 as it becomes subject to favoritism/bias/Mod age.  The answer here, is he should host his OWN fileserver with his file and a donate button.   2 -- He is wrong for the whole Nexus ""only just"" adding donate buttons.

I'm going to be honest here, the 'You should just move and be happier' is the answer we always get when someone living in Europe or USA hears this issue, you guys just dont get that we actually may love our country, just as you do yours, and in my case, how hard the country makes it for you to leave. We are not to Cuba's levels because we are not an island, but even for tourism the customs in the USA will look very deep into your papers to try and send you away if you are Venezuelan, simple as that, they know many are trying to go live in their country, and they know our country supposedly hates USA."

Commercial licenses, using content from other mods without consent, the 25% split, it creates a slew of problems that could ultimately destroy the modding community. (a game could force mods to be sold or split with the company, and unofficial mods are unusable)(and if successful could spur other companies to do like-wise).

modpiracy,33ub7b,leagueplanet,6,Sun Apr 26 02:11:19 2015 UTC,Modding means to modify a video game.  That is all it means intrinsically.  Just because modding was not once a sustainable source of income does not mean it can not become one.  An activity can still be a subject of passion that you get paid for.  Just because modding attracted only hobbyists in the past does not mean that it may attract professional developers in the future to make high quality mods previously that are leagues better than current ones.

Because, they think it'll attract more modders, which in turns mean more people buying their game.

modpiracy,33ub7b,Roboloutre,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:09:52 2015 UTC,"I can totally agree that the percentages earned for content creators are a rip off. I think the option to have a pay-what-you-want pay wall with a minimum set by the creator would be best (Valve has mentioned that they want to implement this). Especially if it were based on a more balanced payout for the creator (say 60 creator 40 split between valve and developer).   This looks like a money grab now because the percentage that is held back from creators is set by the developer (and in this case they were dicks). In this case that percentage is fucked, but in a better scenario with better percentages, this system incentivizes community creation,  developers to create games with robust systems to support mods (leading to longer lifespans out of games), and Valve to improve the mod distribution system to get our work to a wider audience. Short term it feels like a money grab, but long term I think it benefits the whole system.   I also agree with the Patreon type model as an option to mod creators, but in addition to the pay-what-you-want with a creator set minimum option I mentioned before. The more options for creators the better.  As for quality control and thievery, I really don't know. A system that allows for a refund within a limited time period is a good start to fight quality issues (I think this might already be a thing). And refunding users who bought mods that are reported as stolen work might keep the community watching.  These are just my thoughts about this though. Overall offering fair payment to creators is, in my opinion, a good thing."

You know how a gazillion great mods were created? By using content and knowledge of others. So that everyone can play their own perfect game, putting bits and pieces together from here and there. One may excel in graphics, the other may excel at scripting - so the scripting guy looks in a database for graphics, and the graphics guy downloads some fun scripted stuff from a database.

I posted a long time ago about my More Dramatic Alduin retexture that I made. (It itself actually used textures from Deathwing Inspired Alduin which was pretty scummy of me at the time but I've since redid the textures from scratch and removed the previous versions). Well the Realistic Texture Overhaul fellow approached me and asked me if he could use my Alduin retexture in his dragon mod. I said sure.  He has not asked me if he could sell it on the Steam Workshop, however, and sure enough there's the Alduin in the images. Honestly I'm not even sure if I have a right to complain since the visual appearance of the glowy Alduin has gone through two iterations at this point.  On the other hand I was only informed of this via someone else sending me a PM about it today. If he didn't bother asking my permission for the textures, it is very possible he didn't ask Bellyache's permission, and their textures likely were used much more than mine."""

modpiracy,33te1b,Paradeta,1 point,Sat Apr 25 23:59:23 2015 UTC,"It may be true that proving you own the copyright to something is hard if you don't file for a copyright or publish it first, if you get someone's private code and use it they would have a hard time proving they owned the copyright, that does not mean they don't own the copyright.

modpiracy,33ssmt,crazetex,6,Sat Apr 25 14:34:39 2015 UTC,Depends on the reasoning.  Even though I'll admit Intel is better for high-end systems I buy nothing but AMD solely for the fact that I know AMD is Intel's only competition and if Intel had the market all to itself we'd easily see much higher prices for much lower quality.  I believe that to be a good tentative reason to support a company.

modpiracy,33sqqn,THAT0NEASSHOLE,52,Sat Apr 25 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"I for one will not be peaceful about this. The decision is tearing at the fabric of the modding community and you have the nerve to come over here and say let's be peaceful.  This is war. This used to not be piracy. This used to be a great community. Modders put up mods and received donations if they were good. I can't believe you at /r/skyrimmods support Bethesda and valve in this decision by just calling what we, and you, have done for years piracy now. Or at least you should have been a mod user being a moderator at /r/skyrimmods. I'm amazed you guys aren't with the majority of the community on this one.  Power corruption, you guys have."
modpiracy,33sqqn,THAT0NEASSHOLE,7,Sat Apr 25 16:31:59 2015 UTC,I agree. If I was subscribed to /r/skyrimmods I would have unsubscribed because of this. Way for them to take a stance.
modpiracy,33sqqn,MaxKirgan,-40,Sat Apr 25 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"No, I consider it piracy if you share a mod that is for sale or that steam has the right to sell. When a DLC is created (a dlc is nothing but a large mod) and it gets sold not a soul complains. This is the exact same thing but it is created by the public instead of a company. The individual that creates the mod has the option to sell it or give it away, if they choose to sell their work then they have the right to have it protected."
modpiracy,33sqqn,Dave-C,26,Sat Apr 25 16:53:44 2015 UTC,"A DLC is a large mod that's officially supported by the developer and works with the game, and other DLC's that the game has.

modpiracy,33sqqn,Paradeta,10,Sat Apr 25 23:19:12 2015 UTC,"This is only a capitalistic move. If you're defending it it means you support uncontrolled capitalism. I do not in any way support it. Why don't I download dlc? Because I already bought the game. Dlc is also just money grabbing capitalists trying to capitalize on the gaming community.   This is no different. Valve is trying to capitalize on the modding community, but in a very half assed way. It's like someone said, hey look potential money, how much can we grab? Without once looking at the impact it may have.  I am anti-uncontrolled-capitalism as uncontrolled capitalism destroys everything nice, except for war machines.  See, you and I are fundamentally different people. I don't like capitalism, nor do I support it at all. People who actually know me and do business with me are impressed by my business tactics of being honest with my customers and not trying to rape them of their money at every chance. This is why I have steady and enjoyable stream of customers. Do I make a lot more than I need to scrape by? Not really. Are both me and my customers happy? Yes. When they ask me why my business model seems so awesome, I just say ""I am not a capitalist"""

modpiracy,33sqqn,Dave-C,13,Sat Apr 25 17:33:52 2015 UTC,"Does the community seem to support this? Or are you going off of the legal system when you ban posts and comments about this issue? Because either way you guys are in the wrong. The law doesn't support censoring of speech. And the community obviously is in an uproar about this. Get off your high horse and actually help the community you say your trying to do what's best for.   I do what I think is best for the community   That ""I think"" man  So you enforce your opinions that go against this.  Eg. You think this is a good thing- your opinion when on /r/skyrimmods   The community, including dev's of mods, is against this and they get banned, or have posts deleted from the subreddit you moderate for speaking out against it.  Mods aren't there to just enforce the rules, I'm sorry but a bot could do that. Mods are there because they can think and make good judgment. Not to police their community into thinking or expressing views the mods want to see."

If we change the rules in the future then I'll enforce those rules but for now this is what we decided upon and this is how we will handle it in /r/skyrimmods. This subreddit was created because people disagree with that, that is great because people can disagree. Why are you so willing to pressure me to change my opinion on this when you will not change yours? This isn't a conversation that will have an outcome of one of us changing the others mind but as I've tried to say repeatedly ""We have rules, I enforce the rules""."

modpiracy,33sqqn,Dave-C,-19,Sat Apr 25 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"Yes you did, but it was for a mod that Valve had rights to as well because of the agreements. That is very unclear exactly how that will go but until it is decided I feel it is best to go with caution."

Legally it is a gray zone at best, most likely it will work out in favour of modders owning their own content.   That is very unclear exactly how that will go    Yes, that is the issue. You are blocking discussion about reactions to something because that something might be contract violation. You are like 5 steps away from anything illegal.  This is similar to banning people who suggest they don't donate money to GM. Sure they have no legal obligation to do so.... but perhaps they would if the law changed, and some other people give money to GM when they buy cars.  It doesn't make any sense."

Lets be absolutely clear, this isn't an act of legal caution. No where in the world is discussion of ownership rights illegal.  Were you simply blocking links to material going against the modder OR Bethesda's wishes, no one would care. You are blocking ""suggestions"" of modders owning their creations."

modpiracy,33sqqn,fingerboxes,3,Sun Apr 26 06:56:11 2015 UTC,"You aren't 'enforcing rules'. You are making shit up, period.  The TOC for the revenue sharing is -> here.  Please review it. There is no language there, in the general workshop TOC, or in the general Steam TOS that even vaguely suggests that, as you seem to claim, Bethesda and\or Valve now have any rights to the copyright of the content other than a license to distribute it themselves. If I missed it, please quote it.  Yes, there is a rumor going around that Valve is ban-hammering anyone who dares to post their creative work anywhere except the Workshop after it has been submitted for revenue sharing, but while that has not been confirmed - AND EVEN IF IT WERE TO BE - that is absolutely no grounds for you to be taking pre-emptive action like making the absurd claim that a content creator no longer owns their content, because such an abrogation of copyright without the creator having agreed to it ahead of time is illegal - the party conducting the piracy would be Bethesda and\or Valve.  The ONLY thing I can think of that even vaguely would excuse your bizaare interpretation of your sub's rules would be your own mind-boggling ignorance. I'll give you that benefit of a doubt, though; BitTorrent is not piracy, intrinsically. If a mod author were to put their own mod up on TPB, even though the site has 'pirate' in the name, it would not be 'piracy' (which is merely a colloquial term for copyright infringement). A content creator who has not sold, given, or licensed away their own claim to their own copyright (which nobody has, in this case, because the relevant agreement clearly contains no such language) has EVERY right to distribute their content HOWEVER they wish.  Bam."
modpiracy,33sqqn,Tee_Hee_Wat,-2,Sun Apr 26 10:49:38 2015 UTC,"I never said Beth owns the copyright or any ownership of the mod, you are placing words in my mouth. When you use the Creation Kit you agree to Beth's CK EULA which has a line in it that says you also agree with the Steam subscriber agreement. The SSA has a line in it which says ...   You may, in your sole discretion, choose to remove a Workshop Contribution from the applicable Workshop pages. If you do so, Valve will no longer have the right to use, distribute, transmit, communicate, publicly display or publicly perform the Workshop Contribution, except that (a) Valve may continue to exercise these rights for any Workshop Contribution that is accepted for distribution in-game or distributed in a manner that allows it to be used in-game, and (b) your removal will not affect the rights of any Subscriber who has already obtained access to a copy of the Workshop Contribution.   This was created before mods went up for sale so if anything this would have to be decided in court. By agreements if you upload anything to steam and you remove it then Valve no longer has the rights to sale it. They still have rights to host and distribute it to those who have already purchased the mod, since this gives value to the product which the product owner has agreed to give up then distributing this product elsewhere could be seen as piracy.  This is entirely a fight that could be fought in court but without that happening I prefer to side on the side of caution and limit the conversation of illegal sharing of a product that Valve may have rights to.  Bang"
modpiracy,33sqqn,Monsterposter,3,Sun Apr 26 11:08:35 2015 UTC,"I am absolutely not placing words in your mouth.  The only possible justifications of removing discussion of a mod author placing their own work on TPB are:   You think that TPB automatically means piracy. You think that Bethesda and\or Valve have acquired exclusive rights to distribute the relevant content.   Neither the SSA, the CK EULA (which is barely worth the paper it isn't written on, incidentally), the revenue sharing agreement, the workshop TOS assign exclusive rights to the content to Valve or Bethesda.   has agreed to give up then distributing this product elsewhere    This never happened. Please point to the language where this happened. You are making this shit up, seriously.  Yes, in all likelihood, the details of this will need to be settled in a courtroom; In the interim, you taking the default position that Bethesda\Valve own the exclusive rights to something which they did not make is utterly absurd."
modpiracy,33sqqn,autowikibot,4,Sun Apr 26 11:23:31 2015 UTC,"There is no reason to attack each other   Oh, yes there is. You've picked the wrong side. (and I hate having this be a ""side"" issue, but this shit need to be unanimous or it won't get fixed)  This isn't about the modders, this is about a company reaching into a place that they should not touch.

It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress numbers, files, and websites. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored across the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.

There would be three buttons, the default would be: ""Go away and never remind me again."" The next would be: ""Remind me later, I'm not sure yet.""

Most people (including me) would tell it to shut up and never bother them again.  Another issue would be that people are cheap. You would rather pay $5 for the exact same thing that is free? Also, take into account the demographic of the gamers- mostly young people who couldn't care less as long as they bought the game with their mommy's credit card.  No matter how much you coax them/guilt them, some people will never find a reason as to why they should donate because of a box that asks them to."

I can almost guarantee that people would donate to modders who make quality content.  We see it all over the place on the internet and it works so well because the service is still free and people can donate what they feel the developer deserves.  I agree with the sentiment that modders should be able to profit from their mods, but I do not agree with giving the enduser the option to either buy a mod or live without it.  Valve really did not think this through and hopefully they'll see that the majority of people do not like this new ""feature"" and will at least change it to a donation based system."
modpiracy,33r65e,sherbeat,1 point,Sat Apr 25 11:17:56 2015 UTC,"Thing is, Valve/Bethesda is taking 75% of the mod's profits so I don't really think the idea of a donation option where they get NIL would be appealing to them."

I'm just saying basically make paying for the mods optional.  Put a donation option for modders to be able to get money from people willing to pay, but don't actually force people to pay for the mods.  Kickstarter is the a perfect example of this.  XDA too.  People are more than willing to donate to developers who they feel are doing something worthwhile...but it works better because it is entirely the contributor's choice and it's not be forced upon them."

I won't need to realize that, anything that will be supported by the workshop fromt his point forward i will pirate to be safe. I don't think I'm buying from steam again period. if I think the games will have only or the best mods on steam, then I won't buy the game period either. no point in that case."

modpiracy,33r9kf,davidverner,7,Sat Apr 25 10:35:16 2015 UTC,"TL:DR  Modders are now making licensed content for developers with little to no accountability with the developers making money off of it no matter what.  While yes I don't have a problem getting paid for their work this is actually a mixed bag issue.  Modders are using someone else's work to make their content.  Basic modes like adding a cool looking sword or nice looking outfit really don't fall into the realm of sufficient effort to fall under United States fair use argument.  On the other hand total conversion mods like DayZ or others that significantly alter the game entirely would fall under the fair use argument.  Now the main reason paid modders are getting any money on this deal in the first place is because Valve is and the game developers are taking a huge cut of the money leaving the modder with a small amount of the take.  This brings us to the issue now these people are now licensed DLC and/or add-on makers adding content to the game but with little to no accountability on the quality of the product.  I wonder how many remember the horse armor add-on you could by from Bethesda for Oblivion when it first came out or the other smaller add-ons?  I remember it some what still, laughed at it and proceeded to ignore all those add-ons because the price wasn't worth it and wasn't vital to playing the game. Let us also note they didn't conflict with the main game or other mods because it came directly from the developer.    Now when it comes to mods this can be a different story, like with SkyUI.  Many mods depend on this mod to provide vital functions to make them work and probably wouldn't exist without this mod.  Who's to say this becoming an issue to play a certain mod you will need to buy another two or three mods to make it work and then you have to deal with incompatibility issues that might make your game unplayable because they conflict with some other mods you have bought but don't know about until you install and try and run them all together.  Also what happens if that modder decides to up the price requirement for the utility mod to such a high prices that your practically paying for another copy of the game?  While Steam does give you a 24 hour refund policy on this it doesn't solve the issue of mod conflicts that would show up after that 24 hour period. You might come across a previously uknown mod conflict between two paid mods well after that time period.  Also since those mods are now pay to use, there will be less usage of that mod with other mods making mod conflicts less known about since less people will end up using it in their modded games.  So guess what you might be out of $5 to $15 because of mod conflicts which is absurd in my opinion.  Now let me bring this back around to my opening paragraph about licensed DLC and/or add-ons.  If the developers are taking any cut of this money from the modders they should make it some sort of an official agreement to where the mod is officially recognized to be part of the game and meet standards that it will play nice with all the other paid mods.  As is the developers are now licensing a third party to create content for their games and in extension what happens with these paid mods is also representative of the developer also.    As is I look poorly on this and the only to solve the issue is to boycott the pay to use mod system.  I'm all for donating money to the modders for job well done and continued support but if I'm going to pay to use a mod it very damn well work with every other paid mod for that game and is backed by the game developer company."
modpiracy,33r9kf,leagueplanet,-2,Sat Apr 25 12:22:35 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you why paid mods will be updated following patches and why modders will try to solve compatibility issues: because they are getting paid for it.    It won't take long before the best modders are sorted out.  You can actually see for yourself by visiting mod pages and see the authors communicating with users on issues, problems, etc.     From time to time I'm sure a compatibility issue will arise, but I guarantee you the game developers and modders will work together to solve those issues because they are all profiting from it.  It's also worth noting that the current official paid mods are all compatible with each other.  Bethesda, Steam, and the modders have worked together to make this happen.  It is clear they are serious about it.  A similar case is app devs working with the mobile platform devs to solve compatibility issues, problems after an update, etc.  It's not uncommon for apps to break post-update, but because it is a revenue stream for the app devs, they are more inclined to update it.    As for your point about mods needing other mods: so?  If I want to use Boris Continuum (paid software), I need Adobe After Effects (paid software), which I need Windows (paid software) to use.  Cases like this happen all the time, I don't see why it should exclude mods."

Also, when they announced paid mods for the new Unreal Tournament why did it receive no attention compared to this?"
modpiracy,33qzgh,OneTimeIsAll,11,Sat Apr 25 10:08:16 2015 UTC,"There's donate buttons, ads, a plethora of ways to turn people visiting your mod page into some revenue. I honestly wouldn't care if the Nexus made me disable adblock, and mod's pages were filled with ads. That seems fair to me. But making it mandatory to buy a mod? That just lets people know that you're not a creator, you're just in it for the money. Think of how every new song is put on YouTube, completely free of charge. Considering that most people have adblock, even companies like Vevo, YouTube and the artists themselves are better than the modders on the workshop right now. Sure, you can buy their album/songs, which is very fair. But in a day where pretty much everyone has a smartphone with unlimited 3/4G, and there are apps like spotify, artists are really getting pulled short of what they used to get.  But do most of them care? No. They just want to create their music.  And even though Spotify has a price, so do the games that host mods. Paying ¬£40 for a year of Spotify, to get unlimited free music, is fair. Paying ¬£40 for a brand new game, to then have to pay for that game's DLC and mods now? That's too far.  Also, I'm not sure about Unreal Tournament, but I'd assume it has something to do with giving everyone access to their engine for free. Either way, paid mods are an issue."

If you have legendary skyrim, and a friend who doesn't  have the dlc you can give them it for free  Log in on your account, it will download the extra content,   sign out,  Sign in as them  They can't get the achievements but the game works  Edit: expanding,  They haven't put protections into the base games, why would they add it to mods?

They HAVE put protection in the base game.  What you're right about is the DLC. Dawnguard, Hearthfire, and Dragonborn have no DLC. They're just data files. They aren't protected at all. And since Bethesda isn't updating them anymore, if you know someone who has the files, they can give them to you and you can copy them over and they will work."

This means projects like STEP are a list of instructions rather than an executable installer ala Morrowind Overhaul. The rise of a piracy scene for paid mods may change that or not, we will see."

Companies literally have barely any effect on their attempts to thwart it.    Most people WANT to pay for content they love, but it has to be fair.  Netflix, Hulu, GoG, Spotify, ect. have all shown that people will pay for content when it's fair and convenient.    No, ""Fair"" is not determined by the content creator.  It's determined by what people are willing to pay for them.  Unfortunately, for the majority of mods, the fair price is $0; with voluntary donations in some cases.  Selling mods is like if people started selling their fanfiction; which is a ridiculous notion.

Yes, but in the context of this issue, selling mods, it's already been shown that people will make quality mods for free.  People who won't make mods unless they got paid for them wouldn't have made them anyway.    In context of the industry, they'd rather make less money than they are now than no money at all not making anything so they will adjust to draw those who would otherwise pirate to actually buying the product.

This was pretty much predicted by a prominent modder:   Kendo 2: This will be a replay of what happened to Sims modding a few years ago. Modders will start charging for mods and there will be groups of people who will form slush funds to buy those mods.  They will then redistribute them to everyone free of charge, much to the chagrin of the Modding for Money crowd and the entities/people who support them.  I have little sympathy and zero respect for anyone who charges money for a mod.  And if this plays out like I think it will, the modders charging for content will get flustered and end up quitting the scene altogether...and good riddance.   btw if you didn't already hear the maker of Arissa -The Wandering Rogue did indeed ""get flustered and end up quitting"""

Some time ago, they had a problem with the Fallout series (Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics), so they had to remove those games from the catalog. If you owned the games, you could still play them, but it was impossible to buy them. Some days before removing the games, they announced what happened and made a special deal: they gave those 3 games for everyone, for free.  Some time before that you would receive a free copy of The Witcher 1 after buying ANYTHING on GoG.  A friend of mine got a free copy of Duke Nuken 3D, and I got free copies of Torchlight, Age of Wonders, Mount and Blade, Alien vs Predator, Magrunner, Fallout 1, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics (I also bought Deus Ex 1 for $2, that's basically free)"

I've been using steam for years since the games are always available for a reinstall with a fast download speed. I didn't have to worry about no more seeders or download links taken down lol.

I understand how nickle and dimeing DLC from content removed from the game is annoying, but mods are nothing but additional content. Adding a paid section, while it would cause some free mods to go paid, will also create high-quality mods that would never have existed under the free model. It's like if we forced all games to be free for the past 20 years, we wouldn't have but a fraction of the games we do today. A game like GTA V would certainly not exist.

The thing is, on the Nexus, donations always went 100% to modders. Not premium subscription, that's another thing. Donation went 100%. In my eyes, that puts them leagues above Valve.

No  Is a community based on this going to become popular? Yes, as more games are added to the mix, we will probably see exclusive communities or places such as this that allows you to donate to help buy mods for the general public. We will probably see companies try to step in and stop, but you know how files get around easily, its a hopeless battle for game devs and steam to even chase people distributing mods for free."

modpiracy,33sofu,FoolishB0y,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:23:52 2015 UTC,"?  /r/BestOfStreamingVideo has 33k users, every post is a direct link, you aren't even allowed non-full video links. And it has existed for 3 years.  Honestly, I'm pretty sure every single porn sub is 99.9% pirated direct links."
modpiracy,33sofu,Ambiwlans,1 point,Sat Apr 25 06:39:03 2015 UTC,"Streaming is the key word here.   This sub, unlike the other you've mentioned, is posting to direct downloads for files that can otherwise only be acquired by paying for them.  I'm no expert on piracy and copyright law, but it just seems to me like there's an inherent difference.   Anyways, I was just making a suggestion. Why take the risk when there's such a simple measure to prevent it?"
modpiracy,33sofu,Ambiwlans,4,Sat Apr 25 06:50:16 2015 UTC,"There is no legal distinction in most nations.  For a sub that allows direct links: /r/thepiratebay/ only 9k ppl, but has been up for 6 years. /r/scholar has existed for 5 years, the express purpose is piracy and every thread has direct links. 24k subbers.  The internet seems to love rules so much that people invent laws and then over apply it. I mean, I found this sub because I was amazed that the skyrim mod community had rules banning all sorts of perfectly legal actions. Over the last decade online communities have moved from breaking the law, to bending it, to following it, to pre-empting it ... and now they've moved on to inventing law to follow well before it even exists.  Awesome that redditors complain about living in a police state, and at the same time, invent laws to oppress themselves with."
modpiracy,33sofu,Electric999999,2,Sat Apr 25 06:58:17 2015 UTC,"Well I was mostly worried about this sub in particular because this whole Valve thing is recent drama, and the reddit admins tend to be kinda unpredictable sometimes when it comes to drama.  You're really over analyzing this dude. I'm just saying that it's definitely a possibility that this sub could get banned is all.   Edit: Also, if anyone from Valve requests this sub be taken down, the admins will most likely comply."

They should add a feature for when you are carrying the deuce NPCs run up to you and initiate dialogue asking why the fuck you would want to carry that piece of shit load valve just dumped inside of you.  If you defend it, everything in the game is instantly hostile forever against you and not hostile to each other. And you can't level up or acquire new gear without paying for it through a certain NPC that charges an excessive amount for basic things like fishing or sitting on benches.  Oh, and the NPC is just some MS paint looking sack of shit with a poor likeness of Gaben.  If you destroy Gaben's Deuce in the dialogue options you get a speech saying ""Hey, good job."" but the same thing happens anyways because how could you have even considered this fucking nonsense.
