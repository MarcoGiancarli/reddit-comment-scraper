The songs are themed around the social situation in Belfast, that being the fighting between Protestants and Catholics, a quick google of Belfast's history will tell you everything you need to know. Other songs are about our city being turned into more of a shit hole than it already is by big companies, and other songs are just about being a punk and fucking about."

The thought never crossed my mind.  Oh well. That doesn't change the fact that if you don't like Pop-punk you won't like Jeff Rosenstock, and if you don't like Jeff Rosenstock you probably won't like Bomb the Music Industry!"

The tracks are stand-alone good, but the album feels like a bunch of cut material for BTMI! which makes sense, because I'm fairly sure it is.  The EPs released around the same time (Summer 7 Club and I'm So Gross) go well with the album, so look into them too."

punk,3dw8xm,Maclin26,3,Mon Jul 20 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I've always seen Jeff and BtMI as one and the same, what with their rotating line up plus Album Minus the Band.   I'm glad that Jeff has come to a place in his life/mental state where he can just release these solo records, without the idea that it has to be some stripped down, acoustic version of the ""real"" band's music"
punk,3dw8xm,totalbummer24,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"I mean to be fair, BtMI started as just Jeff by himself. And then he broke up that band to start a new band, with one of the same members as the old band. He didn't really need to break up the band he could have just changed the members."

punk,3dw8xm,Maclin26,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it would have been the same. I think another major difference though is this was put out on a major label, BtMI would never have released something on a major because people would have yelled at them about it. Maybe by differentiating between the two, he managed to save his integrity, which I think he did."

They maintain their sound, and have punk qualities on every song, but they experiment at the same time. I don't know. It's hard to explain what I mean. Like, they'll have chugging and downstrokes, but then have lead parts or let chords ring out, and rip solos on almost every track.   On Coup d Etat, for example, they have this weird, unconventional riff that the drums follow, and then a second later they're doing a standard punk back beat. And on Rats of Reality you just know they were listening to Sabbath all day.   It's way more consistent than Wild in the Streets. So many good songs."

punk,3dyas7,RichardStinks,3,Mon Jul 20 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"Sriracha? Peppers? Chili paste? Or do you just mean content? I generally go for cauliflower, broccoli,  potatoes, onions, fried tofu in a yellow or brown curry. With green, a lot of green veggies, including green peppers, spinach, maybe a few jalapeños... I think I used kale a couple of times. Good rice, like Jasmine or basmati helps it out as well."
punk,3dyas7,suicidal_snoman,2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:39 2015 UTC,"Content. I tried using green chili and some generic chili powder and was disappointed, although the chickpeas and wild rice saved it from being a total loss. I'll try using some mushrooms, potatoes and Jamaican curry powder when I finish off the pot I have."
punk,3dyas7,RichardStinks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"Forgot all about chick peas! I read through some of your other comments. Someone mentioned hitting up an international market, which is a good idea. Aside from dry spices, I use this stuff. It comes in all sorts of flavors, is generally vegetarian (if that matters, some have fish sauce or shrimp), and is fairly cheap. It also comes in big tubs, which last a long time. Add coconut milk as a base, and shit rules.   Some curries don't use coconut milk, but instead have a tomato base, which is also tight."
punk,3dyas7,iq_32,3,Mon Jul 20 22:38:02 2015 UTC,"how are you making them currently?  sautee your veggies (i like a mixture of more robust root-type vegetables maybe something that gets a bit squishy like squash and things that wilt more like broccoli and some leafy green shit like spinach), make sure they are seasoned with at least salt, and add a can of full fat coconut milk, to that add a bunch of a good curry powder and then maybe like a 1/4 of that amount of garam masala. make sure you add something acidic in there to tame the coconut milk a bit, i use lime juice. i also like to add rehydrated chili peppers and most important FRESH MINT. the difference that fresh mint makes to a curry is amazing"
punk,3dyas7,suicidal_snoman,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:57 2015 UTC,"I'm using ginger, some 'Hot Curry Powder' (a sad, sad lie), green chilies, some McCormick ground chili powder, cilantro, and various veggies - mushrooms, chickpeas, corn-, and dumping the resultant mix over rice and putting a small amount of lemon juice on top as a garnish."
punk,3dyas7,iq_32,3,Mon Jul 20 21:16:44 2015 UTC,"well you need something to make a ""sauce"" that's where the coconut milk comes in, you could also try making a simple gravy. i think the word curry actually comes from a word that means sauce. and if your curry powder sucks well your curry is probably going to be not great too. if you're just looking for more heat, add cayenne pepper- it doesn't have much of a taste and packs a lot of heat. you could also try adding your ginger and green chilis in at a later point in the cooking process so they don't cook as much, it'll be hotter but will develop less flavor. you could try adding half at the beginning and half at the end i guess  i would recommend going to an indian market, they sell spices in bulk for cheap as fuck. if you're feeling really adventurous you can look up recipes for curry powders and garam masalas online, and toast/grind your own spices. oh and like i said earlier, FRESH MINT"
punk,3dyas7,suicidal_snoman,2,Mon Jul 20 21:24:57 2015 UTC,I usually use water. Any taste/health benefits to using coconut milk?
punk,3dyas7,iq_32,3,Mon Jul 20 21:41:23 2015 UTC,"it is a completely different taste than water. i don't recommend using water. i would use thickened stock if anything, but coconut milk is pretty perfect in curries. not like the drink in a carton, it comes in cans it's a cooking ingredient"
punk,3dyas7,HammerSmashedFaith,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:13:44 2015 UTC,"What kind of curry are you wanting to make? Indian? Asian? Caribbean? It helps to pay attention to the ingredients that are common and popular in each of the dishes. Things like curry powder are actually less common in things like Indian curries than you'd imagine. A good combination of chillis and hot chilli powder form a good basis for heat. Blended ginger and garlic and onion for a sauce base, possibly with tomato or water and stock. Things like Corriander, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, etc will flavour it beautifully providing you don't just whack them in. Smaller amounts work better.  edit be sure to fry those spices too. A lot of people just throw them in but that kind of misses the point. You want to release the flavours."

He was supposed to go on tour with them as a replacement bass player for a few months, but his current job wouldn't allow that much time off without losing his job so he had to pass. But yeah, he's one talented ass person. He woukd open up for Tom Petty, sold his bass player a bass he had. Unfortunately, his career never took off to where he wanted it to.

Graffin is the preachier one and Mr. Brett uses a lot of weird metaphors that don't always work so well. Together they balance it out and make it work much better than if they were separate.

They maintain their sound, and have punk qualities on every song, but they experiment at the same time. I don't know. It's hard to explain what I mean. Like, they'll have chugging and downstrokes, but then have lead parts or let chords ring out, and rip solos on almost every track. On Coup d Etat, for example, they have this weird, unconventional riff that the drums follow, and then a second later they're doing a standard punk back beat. And on Rats of Reality you just know they were listening to Sabbath all day."

I think we've given it a pretty solid go at it and hopefully you all dig the couple of pics i posted! Thanks for taking a minute to give it a look!  You can download it for free here:  http://www.spiritsxxx.bandcamp.com if you're interested or snag a physical copy here:  http://www.spiritsxxx.limitedrun.com   Again, thanks so much for giving it a few minutes out of your day!  Up the punks!"

punk,3dlyv9,paulymcfly,5,Fri Jul 17 12:07:34 2015 UTC,It was somewhat pricey compared to a standard layout but we really wanted the aesthetic it gives. Plus we've never gone into any band or release expecting to make a profit... it's nice to break even and hopefully once we sell all the copies it will be close to getting us out of the red! Hah. Thanks for the kind words!
punk,3dlyv9,paulymcfly,2,Fri Jul 17 13:18:44 2015 UTC,Hey you guys are boston? Where do you do shows?
punk,3dlyv9,paulymcfly,2,Fri Jul 17 15:11:08 2015 UTC,Mostly basement shows or the Democracy Center in the city.  We've played a few shows at the Cambridge Elks/Hardcore Stadium too!

Full disclosure, I'm putting this record out and am a 100% biased party, but Horrible Things (from Champaign, IL) has been one of my favorite bands since this tape from 2012.

It's the project of one of the people from Hospital Job, and Luke from the Copyrights/HJ produced it. So FFO of those bands, I guess? And Steve Adamyk Band, Marked Men, stuff like that.

Alien abduction and you totally out party the aliens, getting your weed card, taking advantage of the new marriage equality decision and trying to marry a guy but the twist is you're not gay and he's the most flamboyant gay person on the face of the planet.  Also a dancing bear who's just trying to work his way through college.  All ideas I've had but haven't been able to write without it coming out sounding forced and boring.  Or waffle house which is a joke all on its own. Possible titles. Taco hell, u.f.o party, it's medicinal, weird to be queer, terry the dancing bear, and sausage and eggs."

Don't get me wrong, I loved their earlier shit, but I'd seen Gordy play for Mindsnare plenty of times to know how sick he was and so I was pretty pysched when he joined. The first time I heard him play with the band was on a triple J live at the wireless about 400 years ago. It is still one of the best live recordings I've ever heard. I used to listen to it on tape all the time."

Secondly, the band openly invited members of the audience who knew songs on bass or drums to come and help out.  It was like a live audition, and a lot of fun.  Three different drummers got up on the night, and Pat from the Decline jumped up and played a few songs.   All in all, fantastic gig that I genuinely think everyone except Gordy enjoyed!!"

He also signed titties, which seems backwards.   This is just what I saw myself. Other friends have seen them play in different cities and have told similar stories.  Obviously, that's not a ""you  deserve cancer"" level of behavior, but it didn't mesh with how the other band members behave or present themselves."

The first opener was hovercraft and there was a buzz around the crowd that it was Eddie Vedder's girlfriend's band and maybe just maybe Eddie Vedder was in the audience.

I would say most uk82 bands did and still do wear this stuff. not to mention the punk revival stuff like rancid. but American punk fashion was always more just jeans, tshirt, chucks and maybe a leather jacket. which again, is pretty typical of past and current American punk bands. then there's whole waves of post punk, post hardcore, pop punk, etc that each play their own music and have their own style.    so at the end of the day, the people who've always had mohawks mostly still do."

punk,3cnxo1,cy_sperling,-2,Thu Jul 9 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"It's just a genre of music   And that just shows how little you understand about the origins of the movement.   EDIT: Downvote me if you want, but when the movement began in the 70s it was about rejecting the status quo of arena rock and bar bands playing nothing but covers. Kids picked up instruments and played whatever weird shit they thought was fun. The original movement wasn't about playing one specific style, it was about experimenting. There was a huge diversity of sounds and styles. The unifying aspect was the DIY, all in it together mentality. It was about kids creating their own thing, on their own terms. It wasn't about the notes they played or the shirt they wore, it was about claiming and creating your own youth culture rather than buying the prepackaged bullshit that was available.  It was only after a couple years that the ""genre"" thing started happening and the bands began to sound the same, the fans started to dress the same, and punk became just another uniform. The biggest irony of what punk became is that it became even more conformist and rigid than the status quo it sought to reject.   Punk's not dead It just deserves to die When it becomes another stale cartoon  A close-minded, self-centered social club Ideas don't matter It's who you know  If the music's gotten boring It's because of the people who want everyone to sound the same Who drive the bright people out of our so-called scene Till all that's left is a meaningless fad  Hardcore formulas are dogshit Change and caring are what's real Is this a state of mind Or just another label  The joy and hope of an alternative Have become its own cliché A hairstyle's not a lifestyle Imagine Sid Vicious at 35"

punk,3cnxo1,cy_sperling,-2,Thu Jul 9 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"Of course, but the point is, they all looked wildly different from one another at the beginning.

That's what Malcolm McLaren used as the basis for the Sex Pistols look.  That's what their fans looked like.  That's what The Clash looked like.  And you're talking about street punks/gutter punks.  That's just one offshoot.  And not for nothing but I've never seen any punks wear a bomber jacket."
punk,3cnxo1,scumbag_college,-1,Thu Jul 9 17:34:39 2015 UTC,"That's what The Clash[1] looked like.   When? The Clash evolved drastically in their look and their sound over their brief time together. The band that released Combat Rock was quite different looking and sounding than the one that released the s/t record. They are the perfect example of the punk ethos. They were never beholden to any rules of what was or wasn't punk. They did what they liked because they wanted to and they didn't give a fuck. That is what made them punk. Not the spraypainted words, or the safety pins or whatever...  As for drawing lines between arbitrary sub-genres like ""gutter punk"" and whatever... it just underscores the fact that those have become uniforms."
punk,3cnxo1,CjCinema,2,Thu Jul 9 19:02:44 2015 UTC,"The beginning?  That photo was from 1977.  You brought up the first wave of punk as an example of a time where there was no uniform look and that's simply not true.     That is what made them punk. Not the spraypainted words, or the safety pins or whatever...   Okay, I have to ask.  Who is saying that spraypainted words or safety pins or studs or patches or whatever makes anyone punk?  I've never met or heard anyone say that.  I feel like people are just projecting that idea onto people who wear that stuff.    And honestly, it seems like you're contradicting yourself.  You say ""more power to you"" if you want to wear studs and band logos while at the same time using the term ""uniform"" to describe that look in a derogatory manner and that someone is MORE punk for NOT wearing that stuff.   As for drawing lines between arbitrary sub-genres like ""gutter punk"" and whatever... it just underscores the fact that those have become uniforms.   No, it really doesn't.  Gutter punk as a term is kind of synonymous with travelers/squatters/crusties.  It's not a genre.  And my point was that you're using that look to deride people who sport it as wearing a uniform when most punks don't even dress like that."

punk,3cnnxf,SamSpike,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:56:59 2015 UTC,Taken a different path from my previous music with Zipperfish (which was purely inspired by classic 70s UK punk - see https://www.reverbnation.com/zipperfish ) - but I still think there's a taste of punk in it. What do you think?

punk,3cmcq7,BigVanVortex,2,Thu Jul 9 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed. My band played a battle of the bands where it was the sort of the same situation rock night and metal night. We ended up joining the metal night and when it happened the judges all agreed we were awesome, but not really what they were looking for to win the contest. It makes me laugh because the one was like 'you should like you should be playing a basement somewhere drinking a lot of cheap beer.' Our response was 'yeah. That's pretty much what we do.'"

punk,3cj399,Atisekim,8,Wed Jul 8 13:31:23 2015 UTC,There's a difference between a shocking juxtaposition of concepts which delivers a socially relevant point and a childish desire to shock the oldsters. I think Bhopal Stiffs and Dead Kennedys are examples of the former.

punk,3ch29s,KillerChief97,3,Wed Jul 8 06:54:03 2015 UTC,Came to my mind as well.  Too bad Satrapi grew so disillusioned by the punk/counterculture movement when she moved to Europe.
punk,3ch29s,juhae,5,Wed Jul 8 10:29:52 2015 UTC,Does Iranian punk exist? I'm Iranian and I lived in Tehran for a few when I was a teenager but I don't really listen to any Iranian music. Is there punk Iranian music?
punk,3ch29s,DrKutner,2,Wed Jul 8 12:49:37 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess I’d say yes, but I don’t know for sure. Locals told me there isn’t really anything you can’t find in Iran if you keep looking for it. Sometimes it’s just really difficult cause it’s illegal and so it has to take place under the radar of officials. Iran has a total population of about 75 million and half of it is under 35 years old. So I guess there’s a pretty high chance of some excellent Punk bands making some angry noise in a cellar somewhere in Theran right now. Would be pretty underground, eh? But as I mentioned it’s just a guess. What I know for a fact indeed is that it can be quite difficult to have a band in the first place. Some folks told me that you need an official permit to play shows or to record and publish an album. Besides that every line you record will be checked beforehand. In addition to this kind of problems comes the censorship of websites like Youtube. I know It’s not Punk but if you want to listen to some contemporary Iranian music I would recommend a band called Bomrani. For example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WcV7Du35c8"
punk,3ch29s,zombie4374,3,Wed Jul 8 16:41:07 2015 UTC,Bike looks like a 70's Honda.  CB series.

punk,3cj2km,Giantpanda602,4,Wed Jul 8 18:51:41 2015 UTC,"My thoughts so far... (i'll update as i work my way through the spotify playlist at work over the next few days)  shinobu - PASS, more indie that punk to me but what do i know  oh my snare! - PASS again more indie that punk to me but what do i know  nofx-ish - PASS who does he think he is that guy from green day? seriously man not good listening to some dude do his best fat mike impression. the subject matter is soooo edgy  War on women - ""Say it"" wow thats intense subject matter, but at least it felt real unlike that fat mike train wreck i just listened to, Roe V. World again intense subject matter. musically solid but not really my style but i do like the subject matter they keep hitting on, sticks with the band name and really gives women a voice in the punk genre where realistically they don't have one which is cool. so far i dig them. Kinda a red fang sound with a propagandhi stance from a female perspective.  Western Settings -  Turn it up, recorded at a much lower level than the last one its a little pop-ish for me but i like the riff on the first track. kinda hotwater music-ish, off with their headsy sound. not too bad. on Kicking and screaming the guitar riff is very much hotwater sounding, but i like it. The rest is more of the same overall good stuff.   Jeff Rosenstock - i actually thought this was an acoustic song at the end of the last album till the drum machine kicked in. not sure what to make of it so far. WOAH now its a full band... this part i like. Pretty consistent sound throughout. i'll probably be looking into this band a bit more. sound a little bit like weezer at times, and i could do without the digital stuff but not a deal breaker for be. they totally threw me with the first song starting the way it did, i honestly though i was going to hate it.   Fools Rush - ""we have clementines"", well the first thing that came to mind is there used to be a gay bar around here called clementines. so that's interesting. but seriously my work day is done and i'll continue on with the list tomorrow. first impressions though singer kinda sounds like jello at times. the singer not the food specifically California Über Alles comes to mind. back tomorrow.  I'm back! fools rush. its good, if you can get past the jello impersonation its reminds me of fake problems/dead to me/off with thier heads and maybe some against me. overall i'm not thrilled with it. a lot of punk to me sounds like it has a heavy indie rock or alt country influence these days not bad, but not 100% my cup of tea for a punk band but really what are genres except labels? so fuck it. 2 more fools rush songs to go...  Local Resident Failure - ok this band i know a little about. (very little but a little) they're not from the U.S. i think Australia or Austria, their drummer is or was at one point the guy that did all the viral punk drum medley videos. not sure if he is still in the band though. suppose i could look into that later. it does sound like him. so far sounds like a fat wreck band with the new found glory singer. song titles are very blah old skool even spelled like that, maybe its a foreigner thing? i mean averal lavinge is Canadian i think and she had that hit S8tr boi. yea i probably spelled her name wrong but i really don't want that in my search history. so far this is better than average lavinge. if you like pop punk with great drums i'd say this is your band. ok ""rockstar"" has some of that metal yelling growling singing briefly featured. not sure what thats about but, HEY WHY THE FUUUUUUUCK NOT. ah ah. guess they get down with the sickness... YEA got busy at work and could not focus on this list that no one cares about. got through LRF its ok a lot of the same.  Success - yea that's as far as I've gotten work got busy. Maybe Monday. okay maybe Tuesday. so far its okay more of the same, dead to me, off with their heads, Lawrence arms, hot water new punk sound that i'm picking up on is now popular.... okay nowhere kids, starts off just like astro-zombies by the misfits, not exact but similar enough i would of scrapped this song if i had written it and realized it early enough. i do like the guitar solos and riffs on this album though.  Stung out - i expect good things because i have heard good things. plus i have always liked strung out some of their stuff got a little out there for my taste but we shall see.... Pretty much more of the same from the more recent albums. Musically gets a little avenged sevenfold-ish at times for lack of a better comparable band.   The Rentiers -first impressions kinda indie slightly alt country to start. Then there's a keyboard a little latter and full on idie. 2 songs in at this point. ok i stopped halfway through this album yesterday, which was at that 2 song point. 4 songs 13+ minutes of music. shouldn't this album be like a max 3minutes and like 45 seconds long max? i mean i hate to pigionhole here but, i don't know that i'd call this punk. but labels are for posers anyway mike, so what the fuck, posers and people who can't play fast anymore i guess....  Teenage Bottle Rocket - To start this review off i just want to throw out there that i'm Facebook friends with ray, and offered to buy his first custom guitar and roadcase for $1500, but i had a typo sent it for $500, then i felt to stupid to correct it after he was clearly insulted by my low offer. Plus i took it as a sign i probably should spend my money on other crap than a guitar that i wouldn't play. so i kinda know the guy not really, but really about as much as i know anyone on facebook. Anyway with that useless story out of the way i dig this album and have heard most of it already. i like TBR and their style they call me steve i thought was stupid and cashing in on minecraft and crap, but then that one grew on me too, so fuck it. i'd buy this album if i bought albums anymore, my car is new and it doesn't even have a cd player, like because its an option people don't want anymore. So the trade off is i go to shows of bands i like and buy to much shit they have for sale there. seriously i have a lagwagon license  plate cover. useless and a total waste of money supporting a band i like.  BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU ARE A HIPSTER AND HAVE A RECORD PLAYER OR ARE YOUNG AND POOR ENOUGH TO NOT HAVE A NEW CAR WITHOUT A CD PLAYER. i will now continue to write my thoughts from this point on as i hit play."

punk,3chwnn,ghsaidirock,3,Wed Jul 8 01:12:20 2015 UTC,This is pretty wet. Definitely moshable
punk,3chwnn,TheKingsBay,2,Wed Jul 8 17:52:18 2015 UTC,I would say the guitars should be louder relative to the vocals. And also it could sound cool if the lead singer sang that first part slower and more drawn out
punk,3chwnn,MichaelSwizzy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"Timing needs a bit of work. Also, lower the vox. Other than that, sick jam. Most of that stuff is production stuff, etc. not your actual playing/recording assuming you recorded each track separately."
punk,3chwnn,peevegrider,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:24:28 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! Might set the vox back for the next release. We appreciate the feedback
punk,3cg18x,Mr_Cake_Fingers,3,Tue Jul 7 17:02:06 2015 UTC,"Good Idea for a thread.  Anyone got anything that sounds like The Big Ups? I'm not to great at explaining what I like about music, sooo bare with me. I like the vocalist and lyrics and the themes they approach as well. Also I'm really into the pace of 'Goes Black' and 'Justice'.  So, hopefully that's enough of an explanation.  https://bigups.bandcamp.com/album/eighteen-hours-of-static"
punk,3cg18x,stuccomonstrosity,3,Tue Jul 7 17:38:03 2015 UTC,Check out Double Dagger. Huge influence on Big Ups.
punk,3cg18x,Baby_Market_Analyst,3,Tue Jul 7 23:35:12 2015 UTC,"I just found out about these guys not to long ago, they're really great."
punk,3cg18x,Mr_Cake_Fingers,3,Wed Jul 8 00:02:31 2015 UTC,"I'll have a look, thanks :)"
punk,3cg18x,stuccomonstrosity,2,Wed Jul 8 00:58:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no problem. I would've linked a song, but I was out-and-about and on my phone. Here are a couple Double Dagger songs: ""Sleeping With the TV On,"" ""Half-Life"" and ""Luxury Condos for the Poor.""  Also check out a Dope Body. Not entirely similar, but they kinda have a similar energy (and they just toured together not too long ago). Joe (Big Ups) and Andrew (Dope Body) both have really cool stage presence.   Other bands that might be worth checking out: early Unwound, Shellac, Black Eyes, and, of course, Drive Like Jehu. Some more similar than others but all in the same vein."

punk,3cg18x,GodHasLeftUsStranded,3,Thu Jul 9 14:58:11 2015 UTC,"I like The Dreadnoughts and female vocalists. What do you have for me, /r/punk?"
punk,3cg18x,MissedHerPink,5,Tue Jul 7 20:21:15 2015 UTC,"The Dreadnoughts have that folk-ey vibe. You might like Days N Daze.  For female vocalists check out Parasytes, Not on Tour, Damn Broads, Makthaverskan, Crass on Penis Envy, Melt-Banana, Cryogenics*, and Punch.  Kinda broad though. Try and be more specific about what you like so it's easier to recommend stuff."
punk,3cg18x,GodHasLeftUsStranded,2,Tue Jul 7 21:08:52 2015 UTC,"Well I was hoping someone would send a link to whatever band approaches ""the Dreadnoughts if they had a female vocalist"". It's probably a challenge but I'm hoping someone can rise to it.  I'll check out the bands I don't know that you've listed though!"
punk,3cg18x,MissedHerPink,4,Tue Jul 7 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"Ah. Well Days N Daze do have a female vocalist. They're not as electric as Dreadnoughts, they're all acoustic, but they have a similar vibe.   Listen to the albums Rogue Taxidermy and The Oogle Deathmachine. Not all songs have Whitney on vocals, some solely have her on vocals, and some have both her and Jesse on vocals (which sounds amazing).   I assume you've listened to Against Me, but if not check out Reinventing Axl Rose, Disco Before the Breakdown, their self titled 2000 EP, their S/T 2001 EP, and Crime."
punk,3cg18x,GodHasLeftUsStranded,2,Tue Jul 7 21:27:52 2015 UTC,I'll check out Days N Daze. Thanks!
punk,3cg18x,Baby_Market_Analyst,5,Tue Jul 7 21:31:27 2015 UTC,Maybe you'll like Blackbird Raum as well.  What kind of female fronted are you hoping for?  Any similar artists?
punk,3cg18x,GodHasLeftUsStranded,3,Wed Jul 8 00:12:46 2015 UTC,"I was hoping that someone would recommend whatever comes closest to ""The Dreadnoughts if they had a female vocalist"". Failing that: I like War On Women, Janelle Monáe, The Skins, Epidemics, Bikini Kill and the Soviettes to name a few (not all punk but this should give you a general idea)."
punk,3cg18x,boundmaus,3,Wed Jul 8 06:44:15 2015 UTC,"PDX folk punk, basically? Blackbird Raum (female vocals, folky), Daze n Daze who are going to be touring soon with a NZ band Night Gaunts (kinda ska/poppunk), Rachel Miles (female folky stuff), Dirty Kid Discount (Just finished tour and a amazing band), and Rum Rebellion are all good places to start."
punk,3cg18x,IAMTHEBATMAN123,-1,Wed Jul 8 04:45:14 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the best band with a female vocalist is The Distillers. https://youtu.be/vACFXey4vjw  One of my favorite songs by them, but that album is just so goddamn good."
punk,3cg18x,guest444,2,Wed Jul 8 02:46:44 2015 UTC,"I love this idea! My last.fm is here in case people aren't sure if I've already tried a band.  I've been looking for a few things for a long time now and am still yet to find exactly what I want (if it exists).  Firstly, David Comes To Life by Fucked Up is my favourite album. The lyrics are some of the best I've ever heard. There is no other album I have ever listened to that I can compare it to unfortunately, not even Fucked Up's own (though Glass Boys is another of my favourites). So anyone able to recommend something like David Comes To Life will receive a lot of love from me.  Iron Chic are a band who I've tried to branch out from but been pretty unsuccessful so far. I can't quite work out what it is that I love so much, but it may again be the lyrics specifically, since I wasn't so enamoured by Small Arms Dealer or Wax Phantom.  Stockades have released only a few songs so far, including splits with Rolo Tomassi and Nuclear Summer. I'm really not sure what to look for when it comes to bands like them.  Silent Films by Kaji, a Singaporean band I have no idea how I originally got into. The best description I can give of their sound is 'desperate', but in a really good way. I wasn't too fussed by their other release here as it didn't have the same feel to it.  Finally, The Steal are another of my favourite bands who only produced 2 albums (here and here) before calling it a day. They're definitely for fans of Kid Dynamite, but I wasn't so impressed by None More Black or Paint It Black. Any help?"
punk,3cg18x,Giantpanda602,2,Tue Jul 7 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"You might like Expire (check out Pendulum Swings), Ceremony (Rohnert Park), or Turnstile (Nonstop Feeling)."
punk,3cg18x,Baby_Market_Analyst,2,Tue Jul 7 19:10:56 2015 UTC,"For Iron Chic, check out...   RVIVR Latterman   All the members are connected in these bands somehow.  I don't remember how or why.  There are a few other bands from the LI scene that have a similar song.  If I remember, I'll edit."
punk,3cg18x,T1Science,2,Wed Jul 8 00:04:18 2015 UTC,"Latterman had both the male vocalist from RIVIR, and the vocalist for Iron Chic, who split up due to creative differences. http://www.punknews.org/article/26086/breakups-latterman-2000-2007"

punk,3cg18x,guest444,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:00:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendation. I've already given RVIVR and Latterman a try but I think it's Jason Lubrano's voice that makes Iron Chic my favourite out of all those bands, and I don't think he was part of RVIVR or Latterman."
punk,3cg18x,Baby_Market_Analyst,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:39:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's too bad because the instrumentals of all three are pretty similar."
punk,3cg18x,bLEEDER666HCFFHC,2,Wed Jul 8 22:25:17 2015 UTC,"This is cool. So my favorite bands are Alkaline Trio, Rancid, NOFX, Lagwagon, and No Use right now. I have a very strong attraction to dark music as well. the Cure. Misfits. AFI from Black Sails and up but especially STS. With the first 3 I love all their releases with lagwagon and no use I realy love Lets Talk About Feelings and More Beterness as well as hard rock bottom. Its safe to say I definetly don't mind pop sensibilities in my punk music I relish it. BUT also I hang out with a lot of skinheads and hardcore punk rock lovers. So you can imagine the kinda shit I get when I talk about my skate/punk, doom and gloom love in my music tastes.  Its all good though. Its not that I dislike the oi! and hard aspects of it. I just always been a loner and didn't have too much exposure beyond what music publications and samplers presented to me when I was growing up and forming my music tastes. I like the Business and the 4skins and a lot of what I've heard. So if this post makes you think of any good bands you might suggest to me I'd dig it. Also pop punk has flopped in recent years from where i'm standing. If you can suggest some good pop punk thats fresh but fit to be a classic in the long run I wouldnt mind hearing about it either."
punk,3cg18x,Giantpanda602,3,Tue Jul 7 19:24:09 2015 UTC,"You might like Plague Vendor, who were recently touring with Bad Religion. Pretty cool live show and he kind of has a Danzig-ish style of vocals."

punk,3cg18x,Giantpanda602,2,Tue Jul 7 19:50:51 2015 UTC,It is indeed Plague Vendor
punk,3cg18x,TOHCskin,2,Tue Jul 7 20:34:16 2015 UTC,Listen to Second Empire Justice by Blitz
punk,3cg18x,MissedHerPink,2,Tue Jul 7 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"Misfits. AFI from Black Sails and up but especially STS   Balzac:    Japanese horror punk heavily inspired by the Misfits check out Deep - Teenagers from Outer Space, Terrifying! Art of Dying, and Zennou Maru.    Thought Riot:    melodic hardcore sound a lot like AFI check out Shattered Mirror Syndrome   Samhain:   horror-punk/deathrock Danzig's project after Misfits check out Initium, then Unholy Passion EP, then November-Coming-Fire   Blitzkid:    horror-punk inspired by the Misfits, and friends/collaborators with some members check out Anatomy of Reanimation, then Trace of a stranger"
