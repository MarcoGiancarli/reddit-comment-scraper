I'd suggest you edit it heavily, as the lack of punctuation, particularly commas (which are different to comas), and basic grammar mistakes (there/their, your/you're, etc) are quite numerous.

HFY,3e0s83,BaggyOz,8,Tue Jul 21 04:57:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's at the same planet the humans had attacked earlier in the series. Since the majority of the Gilst fleet was stationed there, it was probably to test how their fleet would perform against another major fleet."

Because of the ""geography"", the Glisht cannot call for Council reinforcements - it's the perfect test for the fleet!"

HFY,3e0s83,lick_my_jellybeans,2,Tue Jul 21 12:36:19 2015 UTC,"Please don't take this as criticism, I have greatly enjoyed reading each installment.  However, I do wonder why there would be any serious risk of ships hitting each other just because they were on either side of an enemy fleet. I assume the engagement range is many dozens of kilometers, which means that the odds of hitting a moving target you weren't aiming for are incredibly slow. Also, any targeting computer capable of tracking the enemy should be able to avoid allies if that is a risk without increasing the processing burden significantly.  Would you mind elaborating on the situation a bit to help me wrap my mind around it?"
HFY,3e0s83,Exthalion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"When the ships in the middle are using deflector shields to change the path of the mass drivers, it would take a very sophisticated targeting computer. Keep in mind that all of the ships are moving as erratic as they can, and that most counsel races have very limited use of computers and automated inter-ship communications, it can be hard."
HFY,3e0s83,xlirate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:18 2015 UTC,The primary factor is distance. Please permit me to provide a small example to illustrate. Suppose that a ship is firing at another from 100 km distance. Modern railguns have obtained a speed of 20 km/s so this seems reasonable. A mistake of half a degree at that distance means the projectile is 870 meters off target. If the council races don't have good targeting computers they limit the effective range of their weapons massively and modern fire-control software would be a strategic weapon.

HFY,3e2jmi,EAE01,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"A couple of quick points:  You need to separate the thoughts from the statement.  The way you've incorporated the creature's thoughts is a little jarring.    I'd write: So Cold.  The tired compsonasus had this single thought at the forefront of his mind.  It was glad for its species wide, three-toed feet  as opposed to:  So cold thought the tiring compsonasus as it powered through the snow, grateful of its species' wide, three-toed feet.  Additionally, there's some spelling and grammatical errors.  ""dwel"" versus the proper spelling ""dwell"", and ""After a little while of searching"" would be better said, ""After he'd spent a brief time searching,"" or a number of other permutations on that same thing.  Concerning the story itself: it's not bad.  It's not an uncommon concept, though.  The human being the monster for the unwitting xeno.  The thing I like about this story is that it stops without actually telling you why the human is hunting the xeno.  That's a slightly different twist on the old theme.  At any rate, I hope that this helps.  If you have any further questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to ask."

What year would you place this as, by the military units this is before the age of gunpowder so I'd guess ~1400  but that's just me pulling numbers out of my ass."
HFY,3dz8gr,muigleb,2,Tue Jul 21 03:25:45 2015 UTC,"Well the Byzantine Empire existed until 1453AD, so before then. Would also have to be after 330AD when it was founded.

HFY,3e0lur,dieDoktor,6,Tue Jul 21 01:10:39 2015 UTC,While I see the point in this suggestion I do not believe this would work for our sub. Mainly due to the fact that many here have an issue flaring the type of thread's they make here to the point we have two orders fighting it out in the comments to join the un-flared one or rally under the flarequsition.  While we could use automoderator to enforce this and the other flairs so far the community has taken it upon themselves to assist in teaching the new authors correct  posting habits and I don't believe having a bot forceful take down a thread because it was not flared would be well received here.

HFY,3dvdlp,iridael,3,Sun Jul 19 23:27:37 2015 UTC,But dragons burning towns is a very common theme among (western) dragons. Didn't seem too hobbity to me.
HFY,3dvdlp,Turtledonuts,3,Sun Jul 19 23:33:01 2015 UTC,"That's the biggest reason to fear dragons in this kind of setting. The cheap towns are built with wood, Dragons tend to set fire to that kind of stuff."

HFY,3dvt0i,Turul___Madar,2,Sun Jul 19 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"Some more useful information:   A figurehead planetary government was created in the year 2021. It served more as an international watchdog which slowly increased its power as nations centralized into single political entities and the need for a single government arose as humanity made great strides in the exploration of space. Earth was still rather divided when a Tarkirian scout ship discovered the human race in the year 2043. By that time, nearly all of the nations on Earth have created a Human Federation. Representatives from the nations which compose it are part of a Planetary Senate which is located in Geneva, Switzerland. The tradition of moving the capitol of the Federation every time a new president is elected stems from the tradition of having the new figurehead of the “international watchdog” to be located in the capitol of the country from where the person was from. Presidents can hold up to two five year terms. Senators can also hold up to two five year terms. In the eight years since first contact, humanity has greatly expanded with the technology they were gifted by the Tarkirian’s who control a kind of galactic merchant republic.  A handful of star systems are under human control and the human fleet is one of the fastest growing ones in the galaxy even though most of it is composed of older ships which have been heavily modified.  The Human Federation has been involved in numerous border skirmishes. The “Kepler Incident” was an incident four years after first contact which involved the capture of a human soldier. Some might say the Human Federation overstepped its boundaries when it sent a task force to rescue the captured soldier. However, incidentally, many of the naysayers were quelled…"

The premise of a crippled slave girl going on to be the heroine has all the hallmarks of an epic story.  I like how you worked in the wheelchair description - fits within the whole world.

The poison bottle was strange I'll admit but this is a more ""Viking age"" fantasy setting than a ""steampunk"" fantasy setting like is popular these days. Syringes are a no go at that level so that necessitated something a bit more low tech and less immediately recognizable."

HFY,3dsa9v,latetotheprompt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  This had a very Star Trekky feel. (Not a bad thing.) I'm picturing humans roaming the universe and observing alien races. One day they stop at some planet to use the bathroom and someone, feeling poetic, decides to (graffiti) leave them a message of encouragement by using his phaser to etch a message into the side of a mountain. Along with ""Kilroy was here.""  It made me wonder if this situation would ever happen given the short human life span. Not so much the ""I WAS HERE"" but the idea that humans will have lived long enough to have documented other races evolution and at the same time invested their emotions in them. Would a bunch of scientists  break open the champagne because after an unusually long 2500 earth years spent in the iron age, life form X39 in Sector 118,  finally traveled outside their atmosphere?   And on the flip side: An alien race from across the universe stumbles upon this message and decides to find us. Only they plan on hunting us as sport. ""We are the Humans. Come and find us!""

HFY,3dqfh5,dongholio,10,Sat Jul 18 15:08:10 2015 UTC,I don't think it could be done like this is real life because this situation requires both to be on the same planet. Now I'm no expert in planetary colonization but surely the sentient race that got their first would be monitoring the atmosphere as we monitor airspace (assuming they have commercial space travel similar to our air travel) or at least would notice another space-craft landing on their planet -- which would lead to the discussions being between diplomats not children.

HFY,3dqfh5,barkingbullfrog,7,Sun Jul 19 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"""Soft"" first contact has a special place in my heart for the obvious reasons. I love the use of kids as the ambassadors of peace between two races. The dues ex machina introduction of the universal translator is kinda of a gimmic, but the way you worked into the mental model of the kid is monster impressive. Brought to mind Ray Bradburry's Chronicle of Mars series - this is rare territory. I may steal some of this idea for Tyan Book 2: The ReWrite.  I saw the ending coming a mile away, but it still brought a smile to my face and made me feel good on a hot and humid Ohio weekend. If there was a competition for non-standard first contact stories, you'd have my vote a few times over. As it is, you'll have to make do with my single upvote.  Well done, and I mean it."
HFY,3dqfh5,j1xwnbsr,6,Sat Jul 18 23:13:20 2015 UTC,I liked the implication of a colour vision edge for the human sproglet over the xeno sproglet.  And it definitely makes a change from the darkity dark darkness direction that more than a few first contact stories go.

HFY,3dppij,naturalpinkflamingo,37,Sat Jul 18 06:24:52 2015 UTC,"Part Two  Hadrian sat, sweat beading down his brow, the young man hunched over with his etching instrument, laying thin, delicate lines of gold onto the sheet silver. The new artifact meant that all of their old magic circuits had to be completely redone. It couldn't be helped; after Peter's secretive “divination” into the new artifact's inner workings, they learned that the amount of work needed to integrate the new component into the existing circuits was monumental. In the end, it was decided that they would attempt a complete rewrite, where they would take the opportunity to address some of the previous issues they'd encountered.  “Hey, check it out!”  Rainbow sparks ceased to fly as Hadrian looked up from his work to see Yovan, similarly covered in sweat, holding a small disk, the thickness of about five coins.  “What do you have there?” asked Hadrian.  “Resin lithograph circuit,” Yovan said, handing the thick piece of resin to the shadow elf. “I stacked layers of line gold to make a kind of three-dimensional magic circuit. Neat, huh?”  Hadrian stared at the clear disk, rotating it in his hands to see the intricate gold lines flowing past one another. He recalled Rudi's magitech shooter; the crude ones made back in the Rat Way were simple, and didn't have the finesse of a staff in the hands of a decent mage. It did, however, exchange complexity for the ability to multiply the user's mana output several fold by using the energy stored in the layzen stone. It didn't matter if it was a beast-man, an elf, or hell, even a child – so long as one could hold a shooter and inject a tiny bit of mana, the result would always be an oddly colored crystal needle with no real magical alignment.  The ex-ranger stared at the sheet silver he was working on, then the previous circuit that they had set aside. There were many elements and circuit blocks that weren't changed; in fact, if it were even remotely possible, Hadrian would've liked to simply cut out those components and reuse them. It was then that something clicked in his head, and a smile slowly spread across his face.  “I see you smilin' there, Hadrian,” said Yovan, also sporting an ear-to-ear grin. “You thinkin' what I'm thinking?”  “That depends,” answered Hadrian in an exaggerated tone. “Are you thinking about using this new technique of yours to create ready-to-use magic circuit elements, that we can then use to make this whole job easier, and then use it to make Rudi's magitech shooters do things like shoot fire and lightning?”  “I was thinking more along the lines of the first one and small, portable cooling enchantments, and I while don't know who Rudi is, a magitech shooter that can quickly shoot fire or lightning? Count me in!” exclaimed Yovan.  The two young men began to laugh. Laughing at the unexplored possibilities that the little resin disk represented. Laughing at the fact that they would no longer have to spend hours bent over a strip of sheet silver etching the finest lines of gold to make the same basic elements used in an enchantment circuit, over and over again. Laughing because now they wouldn't need the entire room to test their teleportation spell.  “Madame Swiftfowl!” cried one of their fellow student researchers. “I think the heat's finally gotten to Yovan and Hadrian!”  The prim witch sighed. “Oh boy.”    “... So that's it?” hissed Corporal Lewis angrily. “That's the reason why the locals have started a three-way war? Why one of the nations suddenly developed muskets out of nowhere, and another underwent a violent revolution?”  “It's necessary if we want to eradicate the demons once and for all,” answered Lieutenant General Sturmwheger solemnly.  “Can't we do it without involving them?”  “It's too late for that, Corporal Lewis. There was already an incursion that we've just managed to excise,” the lieutenant general said, tapping the tactical display and bringing up the soldiers in the south who were in the process of thoroughly burning down a forest. “Despite what they call themselves, they're all still humans, even with their natural psionic abilities, weird skin colors, and random animal anatomies. Sooner or later, they would've attracted the attention of the demons. And by that point, we might be more preoccupied with purging them than with actually saving them.”  “And then we'd be giving the demons another chance to escape,” grumbled the young woman, defeated.  The general sighed. “Exactly.”  “Sir,” said Captain Bei, “is there no other way for us...?”  “No,” the general answered, shaking his head sadly. “That was the point of Project: Curtain Draw. And it failed. We need the locals to assist us, and unfortunately, it has been determined that war is the fastest way to get that device to work.”  “I understand, sir.”  “It's in their best interest anyway,” said Lieutenant General Sturmwheger unconvincingly. “Learning about the threat of demons firsthand. Now, has the bunker at Little Creek been reactivated yet?”  “Negative, sir. We suspect that the bunker's communication relays may have been damaged.”  Lieutenant General Sturmwheger clicked his tongue. “Typical. You'd think we would've learned by now not to rely on the lowest bidder. Captain, as soon as we have bodies available, prep a team and go kick down that down. I want the colonel, his MBT's, and his gunships, now, thank you.”  “Yes sir!” the captain and the corporal answered with crisp salutes.    Epilogue  The lieutenant general remained on the commander's stand, hands folded behind his back. He reached up and idly traced the scar that took the sight and color from his left eye. He had lost it years ago on this very same planet in his final operation with Lambda Six-Oh-Two after he called in a TKW-4 far too close to his position. He was a lieutenant back then; who knew nearly getting himself and Delta Seven-Nine-Four nearly killed would land him a field promotion? Hell, who would've known that the resulting crater would not only become a lake, but said lake would become a popular vacation destination for the locals? Certainly not Gabriel Sturmwheger.  He sighed as he turned his attention to the data-slate in his hands. It was nice to see that the “elves,” as they had come to call themselves, were still alive. He would be lying if he said that he wasn't surprised that the dwarves had not only formed a nation, but hadn't managed to drive themselves to extinction via a lethal combination of explosions and extreme heights. He was a little sad to see the gentle and inquisitive orcs mostly missing, if the reports could be believed, and he was more than a little perplexed at the lizard people, who apparently decided to migrate en masse to create a mega-ocean-borne colony. Perhaps someone told them about the lost city of Atlantis?  Well, considering the source of the names for the inhabitants of Endellis 6, the idea that some soldier told the lizard people the ancient story of Atlantis and unwittingly inspired them wasn't too far-fetched.  Gabriel flipped through the files on his data-slate, bringing up all the reports filed by the myrmidon over a year of deployment on Endellis 6. When he first discovered the presence of the myrmidon – alone, for that matter – the old soldier was naturally confused. As a rule, myrmidons were never alone, and there were only a few people on the planet authorized to requisition a class three asset, and except for him, they were all asleep in cryo. A little digging, however, showed that the system had him as “requisitioned” by one Major William Redwing, who remained among the locals when the war on Endellis 6 ended. As far as Gabriel could tell, someone managed to find his requisition card, somehow tricked the system and specifically asked for Six-Oh-Two; perhaps they were the same person who requisitioned the fett?  No, that was unlikely; given the time frame, it was possible that one was deployed directly by High Command. Reading through the early reports, it appeared that a child had somehow requisitioned the myrmidon, and since there had been no mention of the fett in Six-Oh-Two's reports, he could only assume that High Command had something to do with it, and some spook up in the Nexus thought it would be clever if they rewrote the file so that it would appear that the major requisitioned the fett.  “I'll never understand Division Six,” grumbled Gabriel under his breath.  Reading through the reports and corroborating them with those from the men on the ground and his own observations, Lieutenant General Gabriel Sturmwheger almost laughed as he realized how much of an impact – intentional or otherwise – that Six-Oh-Two had on the elves around him. Was he aware that he influenced a new era of warfare for the psionic elves? Did he know that the Mozambique Drill was spreading? Did he realize that his actions triggered this entire situation, giving High Command and humanity at whole one more opportunity to strike a crippling blow to demonkind?  The lieutenant general chuckled softly to himself. He knew the myrmidon well enough to know that he didn't care; after all, the only things that mattered to him was his mission and his duty."

The marauder exosuits are not primarily used for combat: if anything, you could liken them to a utility work vehicle used to do all sorts of stuff, from construction, to demolition, to moving stuff around, and even search and rescue. It's just someone got the bright idea that they could stick a gun (or several) on one and use them in areas with difficult terrain as infantry support.  The mechcons are the same, except they were using them for war earlier in their development in comparison. Oh, and they're moved by magic, which you should know by now is total handwave for the technology that moves them."

HFY,3dogx4,mbbmets1,12,Sat Jul 18 00:46:51 2015 UTC,"Shit, this is getting twisted.  I'm assuming that there are MANY other haploid units out there harvesting humans to somehow genetically re-create themselves? And they're all somehow connected to keeping the Dyson sphere operational?"
HFY,3dogx4,latetotheprompt,6,Sat Jul 18 01:22:24 2015 UTC,"That's a good point actually : they're all necessary for the sphere to function. If they go extinct, I imagine the entire thing will decay and eventually fall apart. Knowing this, I wonder if it's really a good idea to start killing them all..  Plus, it isn't entirely like they wanted to be what they are so I wouldn't really say it is fair to them. One option could be voluntary fertilization (since I figure they're similar enough to humans that would probably work fine) or just straight cloning via those surgery vats. Plus, now that our party is there I wonder how much of a stretch it would be for them to start convincing / teaching the Haploids what the Chimera are all about. (Doubt that would go well, though. ""Hey we just got here but everything you believe is wrong. Oh, and we're effectively enemies of who you think we are so you should totally trust us."") I can't help but question if that would really be worth it though.. part of me thinks it best they just die out for ""what they are"" and all that jazz but another part of me finds that to be pretty wrong reasoning."
HFY,3dogx4,lrri,7,Sat Jul 18 06:33:27 2015 UTC,"Well, everyone kept wondering how the Dyson Sphere was possible as there are no known materials with enough tensile strength to take the strain.  I finally answered and, of course, I had to make it as screwed up as possible. If the haploids die off then it will, literally, result in the death of billions. The Sphere has a much larger population than the Earth. To replace their ranks they have resorted to some pretty brutal tactics.  Now do you see why I suddenly shifted to something really lighthearted like writing the Dukes of Haz-Rad Prime before continuing this story? Even I need a break from the places my mind wanders."
HFY,3dogx4,lrri,4,Sat Jul 18 13:01:07 2015 UTC,"And what an answer you've given! I can definitely understand why you would write some more lighthearted stuff: you've created a fairly brutal and incredibly deep world. Far as the Sphere's future survival goes though, how long would they have if all the Haploids died off at that moment? Like, do the ones in charge of controlling the nuclear forces across the entire sphere constantly make changes or are they more simply monitoring ""just in case""? Makes me wonder about the less intensive units though: the ones Jason found are in charge of ""exhaust"" which gives me the impression that they are essentially some form of garbage men for the Sphere. While the more intensive things like the nuclear amplifiers might inherently have their own control computers: I wonder if the simpler tasks would be overlooked for that sort of thing and therefore the Sphere would actually break down faster simply from trash than from something vital failing.  Yet more rambling, this story really seems to get me thinking."
HFY,3dogx4,lrri,4,Sun Jul 19 09:27:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, I am not going to really go into any of that in the story because I have a crippling medical condition known as ""No Way Do I Have The Science Background To Address All This!""  Yes, I know. It's tragic.  I will say that that amplifying the nuclear forces is something that can't be maintained entirely manually. If the forces drop to normal and it starts to unravel, even slight variations could mean their doom.    So what you probably have is that they aren't in charge of maintaining the actual amplification. Rather they are in charge of maintaining the systems that regulate that amplification. Let's imagine, just for example, a highly fast and sophisticated computer that is able to monitor the integrity of the shell. It adapts quickly to keep it apparently rigid. Let's further imagine all the amplifiers have redundancies because - um - death if they don't.  So your computer notes when an amplifier is underperforming or using failsafes and redundancies rather than the primary system. The computer can then dictate to the crews which systems need to be repaired and can rearrange which ones to take off line to maintain integrity.  So, it probably can go awhile without active maintenance. But when things start to fail it is only a matter of time before there are enough critical failures in a single area to cause the amplification to fail. When it does it might cause a chain reaction across the shell resulting in the Sphere shattering.  But, um, you know. With my medical condition, I can't say for certain.  cough cough tragic, isn't it?"

HFY,3dp86i,Wormyish,2,Sat Jul 18 06:54:05 2015 UTC,"Not entirely, the first stage is generally o2 and kerosene(atlas, titan, r7 derivatives, falcon). Some still use hypergolic propellents (proton), which are nasty. Energy density trumps efficiency on the first stage, most upper stages are hydrogen though. I think the delta IV uses hydrogen throughout. And solid boosters are rather nasty too."

How did they get their rank and names? Are the names irrelevant? I'm imagining them being unstoppable evil forces like the four horsemen of the apocalypse or something.  So why would ""vengeance"" be such an overwhelming force? And where was ""vengeance"" prior to this? Would ""happiness"" overcome ""vengeance""?  And Malice seems like a cool dude despite his name. So how did he get to that title? And what was he gaining by causing all this trouble and putting Vengeance on the throne?   And Rhun the Doomwalker... what's his backstory? Why was he pissed off at all the other Greater Lords? How did he get to be such a badass and NOT be a greater lord?  I'm going to have to reread everything and pay more attention to this demon lord situation."
HFY,3dpk4h,latetotheprompt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:49 2015 UTC,"Well, once I get down to writing it again, most of that will be explained. Rhun has had some backstory, and is in fact a Greater Lord (see Demon Hunter: Resolve)."

I went hunting for the lyrics though and heaps of them seemed to say gory, gory instead, which suited my purposes much better.  Oh the joys of having an extra pair of eyes to edit your work. The sad fact is that most times I can't see it when I make mistakes/awkward phrases like that because I'm so caught up in how it's supposed to be than how it actually is, so cheers!

HFY,3dkspz,levsco,8,Fri Jul 17 03:06:19 2015 UTC,"Yup. Those poor, brave souls."
HFY,3dkspz,DeadMan06271,13,Fri Jul 17 11:11:15 2015 UTC,youre gonna continue this right?
HFY,3dkspz,dongholio,10,Fri Jul 17 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"Hadn't planned on it, but I can see where it could be a nice military scifi. Battling along, and then bingo, a new gate from Species XYZ pops open and starts fighting us because we're hurting those poor wittle terrors that just want to be wuved."
HFY,3dkspz,Hex_Arcanus,2,Fri Jul 17 11:17:01 2015 UTC,I'd love to see this continued.  You have a flair for writing battle scenes.
HFY,3dkspz,pogafuisce,12,Fri Jul 17 16:47:15 2015 UTC,Now you need to tell us how long you have been sitting on this one.
HFY,3dkspz,Zorbick,5,Fri Jul 17 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"A few days, actually."
HFY,3dkspz,Vanaan_Frost,10,Fri Jul 17 11:11:36 2015 UTC,"I have you res-tagged as ""READ THIS"".  Now I remember why...."
HFY,3dkspz,muigleb,13,Fri Jul 17 12:14:47 2015 UTC,Ego. Inflating. Cannot. Breath.
HFY,3dkspz,Hex_Arcanus,5,Fri Jul 17 12:46:25 2015 UTC,"I long ago gave you your own special RES flair color, separate from the other HFY-ers.  Solid writing."
HFY,3dkspz,muigleb,7,Fri Jul 17 14:30:23 2015 UTC,"He aquested and poured a drink for me   Aquested should be acquiesced, methinks.  Other than that, this is absolutely stellar.  Seriously, thank you for writing this!"
HFY,3dkspz,Hex_Arcanus,6,Fri Jul 17 04:00:29 2015 UTC,"You're right; I changed it to ""reluctantly complied"", which is clearer and less prone to bypassing the spellchecker.  TIL ""aquested"" means ""property acquired other than by inheritance, as by purchase or gift."""
HFY,3dkspz,muigleb,5,Fri Jul 17 11:15:00 2015 UTC,"Bastard... Now I have no more reason to read anything else for the rest of my life, knowing nothing will compare to this masterpiece."

HFY,3dkspz,kalleron,6,Fri Jul 17 04:39:53 2015 UTC,Sigh    You know me too well.

HFY,3dkspz,Ziccu,2,Fri Jul 17 18:22:11 2015 UTC,Excellent! That means I really batted this one out of the park! Now we just need to figure out who can play the lead character...

HFY,3dkspz,montarion,2,Fri Jul 17 07:58:13 2015 UTC,We found their home world.   You could just stop the story there. The rest was obvious ;)
HFY,3dkspz,Hyratel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:53:42 2015 UTC,That would work if I turn this into a series - could be the prologue or something. End it with we found their home world... And then chapter 1 the battle raged on

HFY,3dkspz,dongholio,2,Fri Jul 17 14:54:36 2015 UTC,"Remarkably well written. Usually changing scenes, for lack of a better term, gets muddy and confusing here. Not this one. Great stuff."
HFY,3dkspz,Graybealz,2,Fri Jul 17 19:55:57 2015 UTC,This should be side-barred and put in the classics.

HFY,3dkspz,sonacantscream,2,Sat Jul 18 18:04:28 2015 UTC,"PLEASE continue this. please.  I forgot to breathe while reading this so now i have a headache, but it was worth it. One of the most awesome stories i've read in a while."
HFY,3dkspz,MarcSkylar,2,Fri Jul 17 21:59:59 2015 UTC,Bam.

HFY,3dnk0c,VerySorryWrongThread,2,Sat Jul 18 12:45:03 2015 UTC,Is this the same world as 'heaven'?
HFY,3dnk0c,MisterTempo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:02:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't read it, so if it's similar, it's not intentional, but I'm interested.  I couldn't find it on search, do you have the link?"
HFY,3dnk0c,MisterTempo,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"I meant, is this the same world the humans found in rise 8."
HFY,3dlrtj,Haenir,12,Fri Jul 17 08:25:08 2015 UTC,"The unliving embodiment of vengeance. A force neither divine nor hellish. That's some wicked awesome symbolism.  The whole series has been epic since the beginning. Please don't stop! We still need to wrap things up with Them. And what is Light then? An eternal Observer with complete power over its dominion seems similar in power scope to Death. Death seems to be one of Them?  What happens to the slayers now? Do they mop up Hell and turn it back into Purgatory? They're still mortal...   How long will the demon child live? Is she immortal like her dad?   So many questions, and we've only seen action from a fraction of their number. We still haven't seen anything from the Imperial Cleaning Service pt 3!"
HFY,3dlrtj,Honjin,4,Fri Jul 17 09:24:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe all of the light in the universe is the physical embodiment of Light's sphere of influence.  Or, conversely, one might consider Light to be the sapient expression of your every day, run-of-the-mill light.  Much like the Death that Hawk met is the sapient expression of living beings dying.  Or something...?    Edit:  I accidentally a letter"
HFY,3dlrtj,Vanaan_Frost,2,Fri Jul 17 14:12:13 2015 UTC,"Death? One of Them? I thought They were one of Death's brother's ""Errant Children""... Anyway I'm fond of this little bit of theorycrafting.   Light is a being on Death's level, probably his aforementioned brother and they each have a ""Realm"" that is actually more accurately described as their body that lets them view all the goings on in the wildly complicated 4D tapestry of our universe.  Death is the 'living' embodiment of entropy, destruction, etc. and that dark room is his Realm/body/thing, from which he monitors all things gradually decaying over time and dealing with things when they 'end'.  Light, on the other hand, is Order, Life, and creation and his Realm  is his body hence why he can modify it to Hawk's needs so easily (after all, he's more than a God, hmm that need's a name, a Principal? an Incarnation? shrugs). Since They seem to have mastered the art of shaping the universe to Their will, in essence, creating things, I postulate that they are Light's ""children"".  No idea where Gods, and Angels fit into this though, demon lords being Angels corrupted by Them (or at least those of Them that have become 'errant') threw some of my ideas out the window..."
HFY,3dlrtj,KineticNerd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"PRE-EDIT: This turned into an extensive bit of Theorycrafting, read at your risk of things not making sense at all.  Well, considering we know there are 10 Greater Lords of Hell; Hate, Devastation, Conquest, Decay, Greed, Unrest, Betrayal, Malice, Fury and Wrath. Plus whatever Jennael was/is, I'd assume Lust? That leaves us questioning what the Gods are to counter them.  We know of Justice, Love, Wisdom, and War. Feels like we're short on gods for some reason. We already know that Hell was formerly a dominion of the Heavens with the Gods using it as a place of Penance before it became corrupted. Whoever They are seem to be either more powerful or on par with the Gods to cow them into submission.  Death seems to likely be one of Them, I think? Meaning there are other Naturalistic Forces, or Principles that can occur.    Death placed his head in his hands and groaned. “I’ve got to explain every fucking thing to you children, every damn time you come up here. ‘Oh, but it wasn’t my time!’ Yes. Yes it was. ‘What happens now?’ You die. Fucking mortals… Anyway, you’ve got the Rune of a Greater Lord, a former Angel cast down by some of my brother’s wayward children, and the powers and divinity of a God, both raging inside you. There’s a choice to make.”   If Death's brother's children were the ones who broke the Hells then that means that there's other big players who are working behind the scenes. Or rather this other things minions/denizens. Light had said priorly he doesn't have control of things outside his realm and his only purpose was to watch. If Light and Death are on the same power level or something then what else is up there? I'd assume Creation and maybe some other basic principle. Order and perhaps Chaos? Order would be continually trying to adjust Chaos, but perhaps Order could be convinced to loosen the sides by agreeing to maintain Chaos as part of an Ordered system, and so Chaos is eating away at it? Perhaps the Gods are serving as the angels under them to Order? And Chaos has taken over the Hells? Hell seems pretty Chaotic. Creation might not actually become represented though, since it is everything that is. Perhaps Light is Creation? Or like Creations observation of the Universe? I'm not sure as that'd be meta-interactions with a being that kinda refuses to make sense to mortal humans anyway.  Anyway, that'd leave three other major players, Death, Order, and Chaos. If Order is fine with Chaos doing it's thing because that's what it is and Death doesn't care at all because everybody dies... Chaos would presumably eat away at reality. Sounds like it started in Hell.   This is all just my own guess work though, I've no idea what Haenir is intending or planning, and I hope I never figure it out. It's cool to think about though.  Chaos would presumably have his own underlings as powerful as Order's Gods. Assuming Gods are under Orders control. So we'd be looking at something like anti-Gods. The thing Vengeance fought in the Throne room seems to be one of Chaos' agents. Not sure which representation it would be though...  I've no idea though!"
HFY,3dlrtj,Honjin,5,Tue Jul 21 03:54:23 2015 UTC,Totally thought option #3 was going to be Hawk killing Death.
HFY,3dlrtj,someguynamedted,2,Fri Jul 17 11:39:10 2015 UTC,"Me too. But then he would've become some Supreme Being/God/Demon thingy and it would just be silly. So naturally he has to choose his humanity. But in doing so he ends up the immortal Vengeance. Or ""living avatar"" of Vengeance. So he's a living, human god of vengeance with a side of demon lord...??  How did he know he had this option 3? What if it didn't work? I'm picturing him striking down both and he just collapses, nothing more. ""The End""   I vote to turn this into a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" novel."
HFY,3dlrtj,latetotheprompt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"Me too, or stabbing himself so he didn't throw away his humanity.  ""Stab what you want to become? I'll stay human thank you very much."""
HFY,3dlrtj,KineticNerd,6,Mon Jul 20 23:53:30 2015 UTC,You can make a better cliffhanger then that. After all that awesome I expected some kind of jab at the end. Other then that I am happy that he picked option 3.  Also holy hell the mage is alive?
HFY,3dlrtj,Hex_Arcanus,2,Fri Jul 17 09:30:14 2015 UTC,"Nope, the foul-mouthed magus is dead. But a cameo was requested early on, and I was actually planning on something like that once I realized the direction I wanted to take this. He was one of the souls lost during their escape, and so he was brought back once Jennael's power was dispersed.   As for Jennael, sometimes fights aren't climactic. Sometimes you just get dealt a bad hand and get fucked. Plus, there's not much of a cliffhanger needed, just yet. More to come."
HFY,3dlrtj,Hex_Arcanus,3,Fri Jul 17 09:51:10 2015 UTC,I think this place is rubbing off on me. I've gotten so use to cliffhangers at the end of a chapter to not see one just is strange.
HFY,3dlrtj,Hex_Arcanus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:54:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's the cliffhanger. There is none, so it makes you wonder, and your mind starts to drift down the myriad of paths the story could take...."
HFY,3dlrtj,Hex_Arcanus,3,Fri Jul 17 09:58:24 2015 UTC,It ends with a slayer skull fucking a demon with a dagger.
HFY,3dlrtj,Kayehnanator,2,Fri Jul 17 10:05:05 2015 UTC,"""Dagger"".... Yeah.   I've actually thought about tossing the term ""skull fucking"" into a few of my stories, usually in the context of being uttered by a demon hunter, but I wasn't sure how well it would be received.   Then again, this is Demon Hunter. It should be expected."
HFY,3dlrtj,KineticNerd,2,Fri Jul 17 10:09:46 2015 UTC,I expect nothing less then humanities utter cleverness to turn anything into either a weapon and or personal pleasure device.

I think I know exactly where this is going and it's got me grinning like a maniac.  Hawk has a reputation for killing assholes afterall.   Both the God and the demon lay before him, dead in the same instant.   Aw.... I thought he was gonna stab Death! Or himself, you know, reincarnate as a human or something because, really, has anyone else stabbed themselves in Death's presence before? Who knows what happens?   The ghost of an aging man in the robes of a magus stood with his arms crossed   He's back? Even if just for a quick smart-mouthing? Dude was like my favorite character in the first chapter/arc/thing! W00t!"

HFY,3dkzdj,semiloki,3,Fri Jul 17 02:59:27 2015 UTC,Yes I got another dose of this amazing story. I say this one is even better then your last in how you set up the plot this time around.
HFY,3dkzdj,Hex_Arcanus,6,Fri Jul 17 04:39:01 2015 UTC,I'm still trying to pretend southern fried sci-fi is a real thing.  This time instead of trying to make up my own Dukes of Hazzardish story line I actually looked up a real plot to one of the actual episodes and warped it to fit in place.  The sad thing is that it was actually easier to write this time. I think the first time I wasn't quite sure how to give a rural feel to sf. I'm getting more of a handle on it now.  I wonder if I can do it the other way around now? Say a redneck version of Logan's Run?  Leroy's Run!  Um . . .  better not. That might cut the seventh seal and let loose the armies of the damned.

HFY,3dhlpt,SecretLars,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:27:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree there are much finer whiskeys out there, but honestly how many would be readily exported to alien mining outposts?  I guarantee someone would lobby for Jack Daniels as some kind of ""ambassador of whiskeys"".   It's more of a human cultural icon than for the sake of actual drinking."
HFY,3dhlpt,SecretLars,0,Fri Jul 17 12:14:52 2015 UTC,"I believe it's only famous due to Epic Meal Time, they're not even good cooks, I've tested a few of their creations they're ""meh"" at best. Can we as a people of the internet start using a whiskey such as Famous Grouse, I know it's weak in flavour but at the least it's the right kind of flavour."
HFY,3dhlpt,SecretLars,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:44:00 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of Famous Grouse in popular media, but I can think of dozens of very popular novels, movies and hell, even a few (shitty) pop/rock songs without straining my brain too hard that feature Jack Daniels / the JD bottle shape.  :)    Again, not arguing your taste in whiskey, only that there are only a few brands that would be noticeable to outsiders.  Look at your average liquor store these days...there are more brand names and versions of similar liquors than I'd be able to remember without actually having them in front of me.   (Epic Meal Time DID teach me about the joys of Candied Bacon, so I can't agree with you completely, but The giant meat-logs they're making these days are admittedly pretty unappetising.)"
HFY,3dhlpt,HFYBotReborn,3,Fri Jul 17 13:21:05 2015 UTC,"Candied bacon is one of their better ones, that and jalapeno popplers but that is more along the lines of the show Handle It. Just shortening Jack Daniels to just Jack makes it  hell of a lot easier to rhyme with than Glenfiddich, Ballantines, Famous Grouse, Jameson or Tullamore Dew. Basically what I'm saying is I've been drinking many kinds of different whiskeys and I haven't found a good american whiskey due to the fact that American brewers prefer to use corn. So short version is America can't whiskey, do what you do best which is freedom and leave whiskey to the Irish and Scotts."

HFY,3dg9ym,loki130,19,Thu Jul 16 01:09:25 2015 UTC,"UC officers denied all claims that their adoption of a Greek mythology motif had been chosen to annoy Max Richards.   Kek. The passive aggressiveness is hilarious.  And why French? Is it just that group, or does the whole AU speak French?"
HFY,3dg9ym,asianedy,23,Thu Jul 16 01:24:25 2015 UTC,My guess is that the western African nations that speak French are the main source for the African Union population. Or it could be just this ship's crew that can trace it's heritage there.
HFY,3dg9ym,still-at-work,4,Thu Jul 16 01:37:56 2015 UTC,"That, and it's probably not in the alien translator database."
HFY,3dg9ym,raziphel,10,Thu Jul 16 03:09:38 2015 UTC,"If that were true, they wouldn't need to jam the translators. It has the side benefit that aliens are unlikely to know French where they might know English."
HFY,3dg9ym,NuclearStudent,3,Thu Jul 16 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"Jamming the translators means the different species can't communicate with each other, too.

HFY,3dg9ym,GoodRubik,3,Thu Jul 16 05:42:55 2015 UTC,"but the RC exists only to make money. THe UC wants to protect humanity. The richards corp should not have this much  economic power, let alone political power. This is dangerous."

HFY,3dg9ym,Turtledonuts,2,Fri Jul 17 01:53:34 2015 UTC,"Why? Because they can't. The RC (as painted by the op) was as heavily equipped as the UC, if not more so.   Yes they are making money, but you're talking like there are investors reaping the dividends of that profit. It's possible there are, but Op hasn't mentioned them so it's not canon per-se.   Also frankly,  I think you're still seeing the universe as if there's an overarching government that can simply exert its will on RC entity. In my mind the RC is of equal power as the two other major entities (UC and AU), not only politically but militarily. I think any effort to dissolve the RC would end up at worse in a civil war, at best in a weakening of the already fragile human existence.   Plus they honestly have bigger things to worry about. They're building ships, designing weapons, making plans to strike back. A common enemy goes a long way towards unity."

HFY,3dg9ym,CountVorkosigan,3,Sun Jul 19 22:36:26 2015 UTC,The AU probably uses French and/or English as a lingua franca. If French is the dominant language then it would indicate Central and perhaps West African domination of the AU.

HFY,3dg9ym,dongholio,5,Thu Jul 16 02:02:00 2015 UTC,Not a conscript. She is willingly signing up to be a corsair. Quite different from conscription.
HFY,3dg9ym,boredg,3,Thu Jul 16 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"I played with terms too loosely, it seems. I had thought that conscripts could also be voluntary, but now I've learned that the more proper term would be enlistee. I learn something new every day, today you have taught me."

There are two problems I have with this sentence - it switches tense too much (past -> present -> past) and has some confusing logic. The plasma bolt passes over her head, yet it makes hair on her arm stand on end? Wouldn't the hair on her head be closer? Also, has she been out of cryo for her hair to dry long enough to be affected by a static charge?   Anyways, good work so far, I'm looking forwards to seeing more!"
HFY,3df744,hasslehawk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"I fixed the present tense problem. As for the other, I went with arm hairs because the hair on her head isn't dry yet while her arms would be since the hairs are shorter and therefore dries faster. I tried clearing that up a bit, not sure if it's any better now though.  Thanks for pointing that out, I really should spend more time proof reading."
