washingtondc,3e2f2e,Petworth_dude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:18 2015 UTC,That's why some big companies are beginning to disperse their giant offices into many small-medium sized spaces around the region.  People can live where they want and work for the company with a reasonable commute.
washingtondc,3e2f2e,fatbottomedgirls,-25,Tue Jul 21 20:52:02 2015 UTC,I envy you. I wish I had a job skill set that was in such high demand that I could toss interviews because I did not like the office park the building was located in.   I guess you win at life huh?

washingtondc,3e2f2e,MouthFartWankMotion,19,Tue Jul 21 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"I worked in 2 office parks and i think what they need to make them successful especially in DC is    Easy metro access. Commercial realestate on the bottom level of the towers    The first point is self explanatory. People are paying ridiculous amounts of money in DC to advoid having to drive anywhere. Shit i pay 3k a month in rent so i dont have to commute downtown. (5min bike ride to office). I like not investing 2 hrs a day in a car stuck in traffic.   The second point is big. These ""corporate parks"" aren't appealing to this millennial generation because of the lack of after work and lunchtime escapes in the area. You have to drive or get your food delivered and it becomes soul crushing because the area has no identity except suits and work.  The one coporate park i did like was in a suburb of philly that became its own community. There were bars and restaurants and small shops around the park itself, injecting life into the layout.   But in all honestly i think the biggest problem for these DC parks is the lack of metro access. Look at arlington and Alexandria. They are nothing but resident towers and office towers that feed and pull from the city by way of the metro.   No one really wasnts to drive in this area and i dont blame them."
washingtondc,3e2f2e,papi_chulo83,11,Tue Jul 21 15:09:31 2015 UTC,"Easy metro access.   In a way, lack of access to public transport is a defining feature of all office parks. You build office parks out in the burbs b/c it's difficult to zone office space in such communities, and, therefore, it makes sense to purchase a big block of land, develop it as an office park, and assume people will drive there."
washingtondc,3e2f2e,theinternetismagical,4,Tue Jul 21 14:34:03 2015 UTC,This is basically describing Reston Town Center (minus the apartments/condos).
washingtondc,3e2f2e,Cythrosi,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:09 2015 UTC,"The apartments/condos are across the street, freshly built."
washingtondc,3e2f2e,Serinus,4,Tue Jul 21 15:08:50 2015 UTC,"It's less a lack of transit or retail or setting/style and more of a location issue.  There are some metro areas (Atlanta and Houston jump out) where there for all intents and purposes is not really a central commuter destination (ie a central area where all the jobs are).  In places like that, I don't see the general concept of the suburban office park going away completely.  DC is not one of those areas by and large.  Jobs are clustered primarily in DC itself, with a few other areas that have high densities in certain specialized areas (for instance, Bethesda/Rockville for health/NIH related industries, and the Dulles corridor for tech.)    Couple that with the absolute shit traffic and high property values, and what do you get? A lot of people that live in the burbs, and take transit.    When your workers are trying to commute from the burbs, it's generally reasonable to commute into downtown DC or maybe Arlington.  But it's borderline batshit insane to commute from say Silver Spring to Reston or Alexandria.  Hell, until the purple line goes in, it's batshit insane to commute (via transit at least) from Silver Spring to Bethesda.    With many of these buildings full of large government/contractor tenants in this area, the issue of where workers are willing to commute from becomes bigger - if you employ 500 people, but people from half the metro area won't commute to your offices in Silver Spring, that hurts recruitment.    And of course, when tenants are large, one tenant moving can leave a building empty.    Just look at vacancy rates in Crystal City - which is an urban style development, has just as much retail/nightlife as many work-centered corners of DC, has transit, and the like.   No one is saying the vacancy rate there is a result of no one wanting to work in urban-style office towers.    That said, I'd imagine Crystal City will fill back up before office buildings surrounded by 20 acres of asphalt in Bethesda nowhere near the metro.    Ultimately, in a place like DC people simply want to locate in central areas if they can afford it.  And suburban style office parks aren't opening up in downtown DC or Orange Line Arlington any time soon."
washingtondc,3e2f2e,Cdr_Obvious,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"You make good points.  Crystal City is tricky. Fifteen years ago, the office tenants were mostly defense and intelligence sector (both agencies and contractors). The post-9/11 changes to the rules for secure office space have driven most of those organizations farther out, ironically to just the kind of suburban office parks that everyone (including me) hates to work in.   However, those office parks are great for security. Big setback from the street, controlled entry to the campus, no other tenants in the building, etc. Those conditions are awful for nightlife, but they make security much, much easier.   For that reason, I doubt DC will ever get rid of suburban office parks completely."

At least MLB plays 3-4 games a week from April to September. NFL stadiums cost the most and are empty 350 days a year.  Citizens can decide how much sports teams mean to them but it is completely false to argue against the simple fact that taxpayers are giving money to billionaires on these deals.  Maybe cities should just own their teams so the city gets the profit and they can't move.

washingtondc,3e2mi0,dmpastuf,2,Tue Jul 21 20:36:57 2015 UTC,GB is sort of a benefit corporation that technically sells shares but is required to donate profits to charity. The NFL cartel will not allow any new teams to join the league under either a publicly traded model or a not-for-profit or benefit corporation model and I would assume they would never allow a city or state owned team to be setup either.

Ignored the huge development boom that has happened in Navy Yard after the Great Receession around the ballpark that likely could happen around the United park as well given the huge demand for real estate in DC these days."

washingtondc,3e2mi0,thelizzerd,6,Tue Jul 21 16:59:15 2015 UTC,"There's some evidence that stadiums move money around (e.g. people who would've gone to the movies go to the ballpark instead) rather than creating new economic activity.  Few stadiums actually stimulate the area (Verizon Center, which Abe Pollin paid for, a notable exception).    On the stadium deal itself, the city was on the hook for cost overruns and the Lerners put the screws to the taxpayer for as much money as they could."

Just about everything that was built in last five years, the developers were given huge tax breaks to spur building after the 2009 Great Recession. The Lerners only had to pay a pittance of rent the first few years and even withheld rent because they said the park was not finished."

That suspect had an afro-style haircut and wore sunglasses and a hooded sweatshirt with black and white stripes.  The other thieves were about 6 feet tall and had thin builds, according to authorities. Both of the individuals wore bandanas with skulls on them. One of them had a green-hooded sweatshirt.   Now why would they provide the descriptions (which are provided to the media by the police) unless it was intended to assist the police in solving the crime by getting tips from the public?

washingtondc,3dzos8,I_Has_A_Bucket,10,Tue Jul 21 02:38:41 2015 UTC,"Because the humidity sensor was cold. 100F and 71% humidity gets you those numbers. If the dew point was 84F and the humidity sensor was 95F but the air was 100F, the humidity would read 71% humidity and give you a heat index of 145, but actual humidity at 100F would be 60%, and that would drop you down to a heat index of 125 or so.  You can get really bad numbers if that humidity sensor is not working right or too cold. Also things like a drop of water in the wrong place will throw it way off."

washingtondc,3e3pw4,growlitheharpo,6,Tue Jul 21 18:47:38 2015 UTC,"Even if you are on time and have no baggage, it could take 8 minutes just to get off the plane especially if you are in the middle or back. Otherwise it depends which airline, IIRC JetBlue is way the hell off on its own, no chance. If it's some other airline you could do it if you run. I'd look at other options."
washingtondc,3e3pw4,juandh,2,Tue Jul 21 18:51:46 2015 UTC,"JetBlue actually moved to the main terminal (B/C), I believe after the USAir/AA merger freed up some gates. But yea, if your airline is in Terminal A (AirCanada, Frontier, Southwest, Sun Country), you will be especially hard pressed to make it to the Metro station on time."
washingtondc,3e3pw4,sprint113,4,Tue Jul 21 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"I would say no. In a best case scenario, where you arrive and get off the plane on time, you don't have any luggage, and your arrival gate is close toward the front of DCA, and you know where you're going, you might have a chance. But just one of those things has to screw up for it not to work. Could you catch the next train? They run frequently. Unless you booked your amtrak dangerously close to a train's ride away. More details would help."
washingtondc,3e3pw4,w0rk1nprogr3ss,5,Tue Jul 21 18:55:14 2015 UTC,"Any reason you can't take MARC, the Maryland commuter rail? It makes more stops than Amtrak but costs less and can run more often. On a weekday, the northbound schedule shows a 2:20 departure that puts you into Baltimore Penn at 3:19.   You could also jump in a cab directly to Union Station. The taxi line shouldn't be bad mid-afternoon, and the drive itself should only be 15 minutes. Bail out of the cab early, or you can spend another 10 minutes creeping along Columbus Circle to the actual front door of Union Station."
washingtondc,3e3pw4,robpegoraro,3,Tue Jul 21 19:09:26 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of omitted details in the OP that matter. Which airline? which gate? Weekday or weekend? What's the absolute latest you can arrive in Baltimore?   Generally speaking your plan as outlined is very unlikely to work. Everything has to go exactly right, with no delays of any kind. With air travel, especially in the summer, you just can't count on that.   Question - why fly to DCA if the final destination is Baltimore? BWI would be a much better option and generally less expensive than DCA. Is it too late to change or did you already book something non-refundable?"

washingtondc,3e3pw4,LucienDebray,6,Tue Jul 21 19:01:38 2015 UTC,"but I want to avoid sitting in Union Station for an hour.   With your proposed schedule, you'll be lucky if you end up wasting 20-25 minutes (at most), and that's if you're lucky.  Frankly, I think trying to get the 3pm train is actually cutting it a little closer than I'd be comfortable with myself (let alone the 2:02 train).  The odds of you making that 2:02 train in time are about 1 in 100 (at best) -- and even then, I'll bet they stop accepting passengers for the Amtrak around 10-minutes before the stated departure time.  Why risk it?"

Switch to a later Amtrak train or plan to use the MARC commuter rail that runs between DC and Baltimore. Your plan isn't merely ""closely timed"", it is impossibly timed.   A general word of advice when using public transportation: plan on a general transit time (it will take me about 30 minutes to get from a to b) rather than a specific timetable (I will board the 1:23 train and arrive at my destination at 1:50), and allow a reasonable margin of error if you must be somewhere at a specific time. In this case you can't build in that margin by leaving early, so you need to allow yourself to arrive late, i.e., book a later train. If you have to wait at Union Station, so be it, that's how travel works."

If you like theater and don't want to spend a ton, the Capital Fringe Festival goes all month. Two buttons and two tickets are about $25/person, which isn't terrible. Most of the shows are along H Street, with a few other theaters clustered around DC. You should probably do some research first though - the 40 word description of each show isn't very helpful, and it's hard to know whether a show is well produced or still a little rough around the edges. This DC Theater Scene website has some helpful reviews of most of the Fringe shows.  I also like the Botanical garden near the Capitol building. Granted, if it's a sauna outside, maybe spending a few hours in an indoor jungle isn't your idea of fun. But the main atrium, fountain area, and orchid rooms are super pretty.  I saw someone else suggested SAX. This really depends on your preferences - it's like Louis XIV's palace meets Cirque du Soleil performers (behind glass on an elevated stage) meets expensive fancy pants drinks. I personally love over the top gaudy gilded fancy and tasteful burlesque/pole/acrobats, but it may not be for everyone.  The Book of Mormon may be sold out at the Kennedy Center, but the Millennium Stage is free, and is every day at 6pm (seating is first come first serve, with lots of standing room). Also I think TBoM has first come first serve standing room only $25 tickets available every day around 10am.... which may not be the best for your actual anniversary event per se, but it might be a fun thing to do while you're here."

They have a medicine known to wipe it out at end of trial, and assuming the 20 min appointment time is accurate, and factoring in a 40 minute round trip commute time it's $900 for 12 hours work. More if you get the endoscopy like the volunteer mentioned in the article did.   As long as you're not completely grossed out by that sort of thing that's a decent rate. Some people don't mind because it's genuinely safe and kinda interesting. I think what the researcher is quoted as saying in another article sums it up nicely:   “People are either really fascinated by it or completely repulsed,” Dr. Diemert said.   Also worth noting, an estimated 576-740 million world wide live with hookworm already.

A dozen or so other less common exclusions.

washingtondc,3e2sq3,zettaireido,2,Tue Jul 21 14:56:30 2015 UTC,"Thip Khao in Columbia Heights. Very accessible by metro.  Laotian (think Northern Thai).  Really interesting and at times incredibly spicy.  Reasonably priced.   Daikaya in Chinatown for ramen.  Also easily accessible by metro.  Get the spicy miso with an egg. Best ramen in DC without question.   If you want noodle soup that isn't 16 dollars get shrimp dumpling noodle soup from Full Kee in Chinatown.  The place is often overlooked and is kinda dumpy inside, but the soup is great and like 6 dollars. Add vegetables for like 1.50.  Horace and Dickie's, which you mentioned, is good and very cheap for a giant pile of fried fish and two pieces of bread (it's allegedly a sandwich).  Not sure if it's worth the trek to H street NE, though, as it's not accessible by metro and probably not an area you'd otherwise go to in 3 days unless you want to see a show at Rock and Roll Hotel.   If you're here on a Friday, the happy hour at Lost Society on U street is great.  Dollar oysters, 2 dollar draft beers, half price cocktails, half price appetizers.

Here's his caption about Columbia Pike. ""Fuck the Arlington Way, right?""   And in Arlington wanted to build a tram. The branch had to go along the main street that connects the Pentagon and the suburbs. Passenger traffic where 18,000 passengers a day, just for the tram branch. This is one of the most active public transport corridors Virginia.  Tram wanted to build not only to solve the traffic problem of residents, but also to stimulate the construction and development of the area. Because developers are like the tram, they do not like buses. Bus here today, and tomorrow it is not, and the tram - it's a long time.  The idea of ​​a tram discussed in Arlington for 15 years. During this time we held hundreds of public meetings, residents and gave the green light. Municipality has hired a consultant to design a tram system began, but ...  Here it is necessary to make a digression. There is a division of the South Arlington, where a lot of immigrants and the poor, and the North Arlington, home to congressmen and the very rich, lobbyists. And mostly north of Arlington it was against the tram, and the south was for. Northerners do not use public transport. In Arlington, they pay more taxes. They do not want their money was being built for the poor tram. Of course, they do not talk, they say - ""Why build it at all?"".  Northerners propihnul his people to the city and the board voted for the closure of the project! It was a strong blow to the Arlington ... Now instead of making high-speed rail bus with the expectation that a few years later would still be able to push through the tram project.  Here on this street I had to walk the tram!"

I think a big part of his analysis, though, comes from having a local guide (I imagine a Russian-born engineer living in Arlington who followed this news)."
washingtondc,3dyl1u,LargeAdultSon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"I live on the Pike and there were plenty of us against it here too.  Vihstadt carried about 50% of the vote in most of the precincts along the Pike where he had no business being above 30%.  It's very good for developers, not so much for all of us who are trying to rent market-rate affordable housing.  Also, the idea of a bus line on the Pike suddenly up and vanishing like a fart in the wind is absurd.  It's one of the busiest transportation corridors in the County, there will always be buses running down the Pike."
washingtondc,3dyl1u,Magellan33,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:26:55 2015 UTC,"Same. But I was for it because I'm realistic about transit development along the Pike. It was always going to be a battle for get $300M for a transit system in South Arlington. Regardless, it was the closest we've ever gotten to public support for funding for the region, it was our chance and we missed it. I'm not saying it was a perfect option, but it held far more capacity than the 16 bus right now and we need the capacity right now.  The worst part of killing the streetcar is that there will never be public support for transit development along the Pike for decades now. If we couldn't get public support for funding a streetcar, people who think we can get funding for a +$1B underground metro are deluding themselves. We missed the bus (pun unintended) on funding for South Arlington, and now we're stuck, like Baltimore, hoping our public officials will remember we're here.   Affordable housing statues are legislated into Arlington's development code. Any new development requires adding at minimum 10% affordable housing development alongside. It might not be enough, but it's more required than anywhere else in the state, and that's a start. The residents of Clarendon 30 years ago had issues, but they didn't shut down development for fears of their eviction. It's what's part of the Arlington Way. We develop, intelligently. The streetcar shutdown was pure ideology, in the wrong direction."

washingtondc,3dy5tu,cssvt,3,Mon Jul 20 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"With the current-gen SmarTrip, even if this were possible, it would essentially be fare evasion. The value of your SmarTrip is stored directly on the card, so if you were able to emulate that card, the transactions you made on the emulated card would not be reflected on the physical one. That would never be sanctioned by WMATA.  The next gen payment system currently in pilot will support smartphones via Android Pay/Apple Pay.  (Also see my comment a bit lower in the thread for my Android metro app. The feature set is limited since it's a hobby but I'm open to feature requests.)"

Metro is definitely more cost-effective than taking a cab, and honestly, though there are plenty of complaints if you're a commuter (which I am), it's both safe and reliable.  But please... PLEASE... on any and every escalator stand on the right, walk on the left, and don't stand two-across.  Also, be sure to check the WMATA website to see how often the trains are running.  No sense rushing to catch the green line at Archives if it won't be there for another 20 minutes.  Also consider picking up a Capitol Bike share day pass.  There are bike share stations all over town, and it's a fun way to see more of the city."

washingtondc,3dznhs,Eurynom0s,17,Mon Jul 20 23:20:06 2015 UTC,"Repeating a few good comments for emphasis:  Downtown DC is very walkable; I would walk from A&S all the way to the National Portrait Gallery in Chinatown, rather than Metro. I doubt Metro would be faster.  DC has very muggy and hot summers, please be prepared for that. Carry water. Try to spend most of your daytime, especially afternoons, indoors.  Instead of touring the National Mall during the day, wait until evening. The air will be much cooler, and the monuments are lit impressively at night. Many locals have a lot of affection for the Mall in the evening. The Mall is very safe at all hours.  Assuming you have a smartphone, Google Maps will give you very good directions with public transit.  Stopping in art museums could be a very cool experience for your child. The Hirschorn is the weird one (shaped like a giant donut); the National Gallery of Art is the classic one.   Buy SmartTrip cards. The paper cards are a ripoff."
washingtondc,3dznhs,MasterYogurt,13,Mon Jul 20 22:19:50 2015 UTC,"I'll mention some metro tips that no one else has said yet:   When your train arrives, go to one of the sets of doors and stand to the side to wait for anyone who may be getting off to pass by first. Then you can get on.  Be quick about getting on. The doors only stay open for 5-10 seconds max. Be prepared to get off at your stop. This may mean determining which stop comes immediately before your stop so you know that yours is next. If you hear the door chimes indicating that the doors are closing, don't attempt to rush on at that point. They don't work like elevator doors and they hurt when they close on you. You might see locals slipping through the door at the last second, but we know what we're doing and how quickly we need to do it. Just don't attempt it. Assuming you get a Smartrip card, get it out as you are walking to the turnstile and have it ready before you get there. If you need to fumble for it or if you can't figure out what pocket you put it in, move to the side.  Don't bring food or drink (except bottled water) into the station or onto the train. It's pretty much seen as classless and it's also against the rules.   The lit status signs on the platform that look like this tell you (from left to right) the abbreviated line color (orange, red, blue, silver, yellow, green), the number of cars on the train, the destination/direction of the train, and how many minutes until it arrives."
washingtondc,3dznhs,ParadoxDC,6,Tue Jul 21 00:49:12 2015 UTC,"Another Metro item along the same vein:   You don't have to wait until the faregates close behind the person in front of you to tap your SmarTrip or insert your farecard. The faregates can stay open for any number of passengers, provided each is efficient at tapping/inserting their SmarTrip/farecard."
washingtondc,3dznhs,MrTheorem,4,Tue Jul 21 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"I strayed away from this intentionally because, let's face it, it takes a few times to get that timing right.

It would definitely be cheaper than driving everywhere and paying for parking, or taking Uber to get around. If you're here for a week and will be metro-ing a bit, the generally accepted advice is to go ahead and splurge on a SmartTrip Card. They're our reusable plastic fare cards that are (kind of) easy to get reloaded with fare money if you run out. Each person will need their own, just so you know. You'll have to pay for the card itself, but since using a paper fare card adds a $1 surcharge onto each Metro trip you take, you'll end up saving yourself quite a bit of money in the long run. They're used for Metro trains AND buses, in case you realize a bus route will get you somewhere a little easier than a train.    How easy is it to navigate if your have little to no experience with public transit?   Not too bad at all. I think the color/route system is much more user friendly than NYC's, for example. They have a handy trip planner on their site (http://www.wmata.com/rider_tools/tripplanner/tripplanner_form_solo.cfm) which you can be as vague or specific as you like with. It also lets you factor in such decisions as ""Train only/bus only/combine bus and train"" or walking distance between stations and your final destination.   Any tips/tricks we should know about?   Tourists get complained about a lot (we still love you guys, though). The big things to keep in mind are:  When boarding a train, stand to the side of the doors to let people off the train before trying to board it.   When riding an escalator, Stand Right, Walk Left. If you are riding it while standing still, stay to the right side so people in a hurry (and we're all in a hurry) can pass you on the left.   Also when riding an escalator, when you reach the top, KEEP MOVING. We know it can be overwhelming seeing whatever you're seeing for the first time, but there's dozens of people behind you on their daily commute who see it every day, and you're blocking them from exiting. Just keep moving until you find a place to stand out of the way and get your bearings.   Aside from that, have fun! We're a great city with tons to do."
washingtondc,3dznhs,amateurbeard,7,Mon Jul 20 21:04:48 2015 UTC,"Keep moving when you hit the top or bottom of the escalator. Not only is it annoying, it can actually be dangerous if you're blocking a full escalator of people who literally cannot stop moving."
washingtondc,3dznhs,MasterYogurt,5,Mon Jul 20 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"You should consider downloading a transit app for your phone!

Transit is nice, though, because it tells you which stop is closest to you along with the next scheduled arrival."
washingtondc,3dznhs,YourWaterloo,3,Mon Jul 20 22:54:57 2015 UTC,"Yes this. I'm not familiar with Transit, but CityMapper saved my life the first few months I lived here. It tells you exactly which line to use in which direction and gives you different transit options (metro and walking, metro and bus, metro and bike share etc...) and (pretty accurate) estimates for how long each will take. It also alerts you of delays on any lines. Which happen often, especially on weekends."

I am not sure if they have any in Arlington, but there may be.   The main thing I will note, is all trains and station signs let you know the direction by stating the final station in that direction. So you will want to look up ahead of time the direction you are going and which stations are at the end of that line. You may want to print out a map. Just be sure to step to the side to look at it :)"
washingtondc,3dznhs,keyedinn052,3,Mon Jul 20 21:38:53 2015 UTC,"Buy a Smartrip pass at the Rosslyn station for all 3 of you. That takes care of the Metro, which is fairly easy to navigate, particularly considering you aren't traveling far.   If by ""Arlington"", you mean the cemetery, you can easily walk there from your hotel. If you don't mind doing some walking, it's a pleasant stroll to A&S from your hotel. Just cross the Key Bridge and drop down to the C&O path below. You can follow the river and intersect the Mall, and then pass the monuments on your way to the museum.

The doors on the metro cars are NOT LIKE ELEVATOR DOORS. They will NOT stay open if you try to hold them. Make sure your whole family knows to all get on board the train quickly (after letting everyone out first, of course).   http://www.wmata.com/ is the official site; you can check fares there."

washingtondc,3dznhs,MrTheorem,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:17 2015 UTC,"If you do ride Metro, remember that you need your farecard/SmartTrip card for both entry and exit; the fare is based on distance traveled (and whether it's rush hour).  To get from your hotel to the Mall or downtown DC, Metro is a good choice. With a SmarTrip card, one-way fare (per person) is $1.85/off-peak and $2.25/rush hour. Paper farecard prices cost $1 more.  I'd recommend looking at Google Maps at a level where you can see the building outlines of the A&S museum, etc.: for many cases within downtown DC, it's more efficient to walk than to take Metro. I'd likely walk from Air&Space to Archives, myself.  One other transit option to keep in mind is the DC Circulator, a set of frequent and distinctively marked buses with $1 fares, payable as cash or with a SmarTrip card.   Unfortunately Google Maps doesn't show precisely where the station entrances are. The signage around DC can be subtle: there are some small blue wayfinding signs around the mall and downtown, and Metro stations themselves are marked with brown pylons. The best thing to do is to go to WMATA's homepage, then go to Rail>Maps and then click on a station of interest. Here, for example, is L'Enfant Plaza, which would be the best option for the Air&Space museum. From there, click on the Evacuation/Entrances section to get detailed street-level maps which show exactly where the escalators and elevators are. (Most downtown stations have multiple entrances and exits.) You can see on one of these maps that the Maryland Avenue exit is only a block or so from the Air&Space museum, while the other entrances are a more significant walk away."

One of the contributing factors to the January L'Enfant incident was DCFEMS unwillingness to cooperate with MTPD on evacuating the stranded train. If the fire staffer in the ROCC is not a supervisor, they will be just as powerless as MTPD was during the last incident. Paramilitary organizations like firefighters tend to have a cultural issue when it comes to critical decision-making in the field. Leadership doesn't like to be second-guessed and typically won't solicit input from subordinates.  The upshot though is that it will expose rank-and-file firefighters to Metro's operations and the unique challenges involved. Hopefully MWCOG continually rotates firefighters from each jurisdiction through the position rather than using nepotism or union seniority to reward someone with an easy desk job."

USAA if you're very brand loyal.  If you want to understand why you should get it (despite the mandatory nature of it in this case) go back through threads in this sub from last winter. More than a few horror stories from people with burst pipes whose homes became uninhabitable for days or weeks at a time. Saving 100 bucks a year is absolutely not worth that nightmare if you can at all afford it.
washingtondc,3dyva3,dcgrump,3,Mon Jul 20 19:42:35 2015 UTC,"I've usually used USAA.  Not necessarily the cheapest, but it's convenient for me and people that I know that have made claims said it was very easy and they were well taken care of."
washingtondc,3dyva3,justatouchcrazy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:05 2015 UTC,USAA
washingtondc,3dyva3,ajl1239,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:37 2015 UTC,"If you have auto, just call your current company. You'll receive a multi-policy discount on both premiums which will likely be greater than any savings you'd find shopping around."

Beyond that, do you have any memberships in clubs that might get you a discount - employee union, professional organizations, alumni association, etc?    Quotes are free but it might be worth it to sign up for a throwaway phone number or email address if you don't want to continue to be bothered."

This offer is available every day and I never see a line or anything during the week for tickets, but I wouldn't know what a Saturday might look like."

washingtondc,3e0s95,tsengr0916,5,Tue Jul 21 02:02:41 2015 UTC,"Rush hour violations are no joke. These are the violations that they do frequently tow for. You got lucky. Even a ""courtesy tow"" across the street would have run you another $100+.   I need to know the worst situation. It's a rental car.   Pay it. Don't even try to fight it. If the rental company gets the fine first they're going to bill you for it plus another big processing fee on top.    the constitution street.   Constitution Avenue. And quit parking illegally."
washingtondc,3e0s95,dcgrump,3,Tue Jul 21 02:42:50 2015 UTC,"Towing requested is fairly standard on tickets here -- in many cases you are in a tow away zone. Now, DC tow trucks are backed up enough that unless you are blocking a street or someone's driveway you will probably get back to your car and move it before the tow happens. And when they do it is typically a ""courtesy"" tow around the corner rather than all the way down to blue plains.  As for what to do, note that the rental company will charge you back with the ticket, probably with a bunch of processing fees so you are on the hook for it any way you want to carry it. Easiest thing to do is pop the ticket number into https://prodpci.etimspayments.com/pbw/include/dc_parking/input.jsp?ticketType=P and have your non amex credit card handy."
washingtondc,3e0s95,wwb_99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:16 2015 UTC,"For a vehicle to be towed the ""tow requested"" box has to be checked.  It doesn't necessarily mean that a tow was actually requested.  For rush hour stuff, the city usually will have a truck that just goes around and relocates vehicles (be thankful this didn't happen to you).  The rental company will come after you to pay a ticket if one gets put in under their car's tag."
washingtondc,3e0s95,Gilyon01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:28:12 2015 UTC,"If it has no fine marked and does not have a signature, you may be able to get the ticket dismissed by going to adjudication services. I've had good luck at in-person hearings. It looks like they also have an online adjudication process now, but the website says you can expect to hear back in six months! http://dmv.dc.gov/node/174782"
washingtondc,3e0s95,The_Fourth_Doctor,2,Tue Jul 21 14:57:36 2015 UTC,"Do any tickets have a signature? The ticket just spits out of a machine. Plus OP said the ticket says it says a rush hour violation so how could it also not have the fine marked?  The only thing I can think of is that this could be a hand-written ticket issued by NPS or some other federal agency, in which case fighting it may be a completely different animal than the standard DPW process."
washingtondc,3e0s95,tiny_apt_brewer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:37:49 2015 UTC,"You are correct. I looked at some old tickets that I've kept, and they do not have signatures, just the officer's name printed. But they do have fine amounts written. The comments field may also state what the restrictions are for the sign that was violated. Nearly all of the tickets I've contested were for parking in front of temporary ""emergency no parking"" signs, which require being posted 72 hours in advance. A lot of people who post these just do it the night before, leaving little opportunity for street parkers to even see the signs. Many times when I've gone to fight these, the ticket was dismissed (before I even was asked to argue my case) because some necessary boxes were left empty, like way the fine is missing from the OP's ticket."
