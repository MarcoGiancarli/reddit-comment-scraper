Pretty much anything from their first 3 albums and then some have really great jams with interesting basslines going on under the guitar solos. The arrangements get tighter and more conventional later on.  PS: I also like the bassists for Revelation (check out the song Morning Sun) and Cathedral (uh...

Even if you think you can handle loud shows, bring decent earplugs anyway and be prepared to reevaluate your definition of ""loud""  EDIT: Check it http://songkick.tumblr.com/post/2638209510/i-stumbled-across-these-technical-riders-for-the   ""To quote the technical rider “SUNN is 125dB on stage, Sunn is VERY LOUD” ... A loud rock concert is considered to be around 115 decibels. Around 120dB is considered the “threshold of discomfort”. Decibels are on a logarithmic scale, so as you go higher, things get even louder. Your Brain on Music gives the example that 126dB is actually four times louder than 120dB."""

doommetal,3dzx95,young_mcdonald,2,Mon Jul 20 22:27:25 2015 UTC,"Not related to the so-called 'doom' genre in any way, but one of my fave bands*--which had impressed me a during a couple of previous shows with gestures that showcased their professionalism despite their amateur status--again showed their ""maturity"" as a band.  They held a show in their hometown at a renovated firehouse, which allowed them to play with their full brass section (3-4 trumpets and trombones I believe).  But after a couple of songs, it became apparent that the venue's acoustics were being overwhelmed by the volume, and the band had most of the brass sit the show out.  Knowing when to 'turn it down' to fit a particular acoustic space is a valuable skill for a touring band, and I definitely agree in OP's use of the word ""maturity"" to describe this.  *The band was The Great White Jenkins, from Richmond VA."

doommetal,3d922s,Yehann,2,Tue Jul 14 15:27:54 2015 UTC,I saw them open for the Wizard. They were legit but it was much more a 70s retro rock sound than doomy.
doommetal,3d922s,smoktimus_prime,2,Tue Jul 14 15:57:37 2015 UTC,Doom came straight out of the late 60s/70s.
doommetal,3d922s,marsinfurs,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:46:01 2015 UTC,"sure. A lot of doom was influenced by Hendrix, but that doesn't make Hendrix doom."
doommetal,3d922s,smoktimus_prime,2,Tue Jul 14 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Why are we revising this genres history? It's laid out there so very bare. Sabbath influenced doom, they were a heavy metal band."

doommetal,3d922s,marsinfurs,0,Tue Jul 14 18:37:11 2015 UTC,no shit?
doommetal,3d922s,smoktimus_prime,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:02:50 2015 UTC,How do you figure?
doommetal,3d922s,MaxRenn,2,Tue Jul 14 18:06:53 2015 UTC,Ever heard of Black Sabbath?
doommetal,3d922s,marsinfurs,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:35:21 2015 UTC,So during the 70s when people were listening and talking about Black Sabbath they were referred to as a Doom Metal band?
doommetal,3d922s,MaxRenn,2,Tue Jul 14 18:57:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure what argument you're trying to make, but the S/T record by Black Sabbath that came out in 1969 is the first record from which modern doom is rooted in and from which bands that were integral in the doom revival (such as Sleep and Electric Wizard) were influenced by. Does it really matter if people in 1969 were calling it doom or not if that is what it is now referred to as?"
doommetal,3d922s,marsinfurs,-6,Tue Jul 14 19:05:53 2015 UTC,"First off the self titled came out in 1970 not 69. Second, rooted in and came straight out of I dunno what you're even getting across now, but the mention of Black Sabbath as an example to support the emergence of doom as a genre isn't supported. Did they have a hand in influencing a new genre? Yeah, but they also helped influence a lot of other bands and genres. They were NEVER considered a doom metal band just as the Beatles were never considered a heavy metal band a genre they had a hand in influencing.   So to say doom came out of the 60s and 70s is incorrect as it wasn't a formed genre until the early to mid 80s,  and just because bands site them as an  influence doesn't and cannot change what they were, a heavy metal band."
doommetal,3d922s,MaxRenn,5,Tue Jul 14 19:55:16 2015 UTC,I feel stupider for having argued this with you.
doommetal,3d922s,marsinfurs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:01:56 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
doommetal,3d922s,MaxRenn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:15:54 2015 UTC,If you're claiming that Sabbath is not a doom band...   Then... You're just wrong. That's it.
doommetal,3d922s,SomeCreate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:53:16 2015 UTC,Sabbath is usually listed as a Doom band only in hindsight! Doom did not exist during the time of the first four Sabbath albums and did not become an established genre until the 80s.
doommetal,3d922s,MaxRenn,-2,Wed Jul 15 02:16:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've listened to everything they ever put out since their demo and seen  them play. Still never hooked me. I dunno about 70s rock, they aren't doomy. It's more punky, skate music with lyrics that come from that era and genre."
doommetal,3d922s,MaxRenn,3,Tue Jul 14 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"Woah. This all got a little heated while I was away. Not that that's a bad thing. I'm glad to see people here are passionate about the scene.  For my money Satan's Satyrs are one of the best new bands around. Clayton is a serious force, great live, excellent in the studio, and just a general badass dude. He mentioned in an older interview (and sort of in this one) that the first album was the product of an equal influence from Electric Wizard and Black Flag. Makes total sense to me.  I hear what you're saying, in no way is this traditional doom, and has little relation to much else going on in the scene right now. However, the doom is in there. In the lyrics, themes and riffs. There's also a lot of other stuff in there too. For me it's a testament to the flexibility of the genre, and how many bands fit under the doom umbrella.  On a related note I understand you getting frustrated by people mis-defining the genre. I get annoyed looking at this board when pages and pages of bands being posted aren't doom at all. Most of what get called doom here is an admixture of Sludge, Death, and Noise, with drop G tuning. I absolutely can't stand Conan for example and don't think they have anything to do with Doom.  (I can elaborate on why if anyone cares).   After all Doom is just a sub-genre of and sub-genre of a sub-genre, and it's definition has shifted by miles since its foundation in the 80's and its 70's precedents in Heavy Metal, and Downer Rock (still the best genre name for most proto-doom).   Satan's Satyrs are innovating, and serious heads are taking notice. Listen to the latest Electric Wizard record and you can hear how into SS, Juss is. Their whole bass sound has shifted towards what Clayton is doing, and it was recorded before he even joined! It's cool you aren't into them, but that doesn't make them ""meh"". They saw something no one else did, and tore open a whole world of possibilities. I'm super stoked for a new album..."
doommetal,3d922s,Yehann,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:40:49 2015 UTC,"They are innovative in their own way. Definitely doom, but they mix with a lot of other genres. For example, their first album is very punk-based, but their second has a surf rock influence. The vocals can turn some people off, though I love Clayton's voice on the second record. Die Screaming is my favorite album of 2014. Can't wait for #3.  I'm not a fan of Conan either, but I'm interested in how you don't think they're doom."
doommetal,3d922s,MaxRenn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:19:36 2015 UTC,"I do not hate Satan's  Satyrs, I just don't  care for them. There is a lot of music that gets posted here that doesn't hit me as good, but that's my opinion. You know I got no problems with you subcomcwii.   I wanna hear about Conan not being doom.

doommetal,3cjerr,marsinfurs,2,Wed Jul 8 15:03:46 2015 UTC,"Wow it's wild to see them come up online, you from Fort Worth? I've seen them live a few times, wanting to play a show with them soon. Super nice guys if you haven't met them."
doommetal,3cjerr,up-and-adam,3,Wed Jul 8 16:40:44 2015 UTC,I'm in CA I just heard them on the Midnite Communion II mixtape that Cough put out then I checked out their bandcamp and fell in love with Death.   I'm really into proto-doom and 60s psych and I love how they have captured that sound...I hope they get more exposure because they really kick ass.
doommetal,3cjerr,marsinfurs,2,Wed Jul 8 16:50:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah me too, they shred. glad to hear they have fans all over!"
doommetal,3cjerr,up-and-adam,2,Wed Jul 8 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome, a new CVLT Sessions. The Paranoid one was great."
doommetal,3cjerr,Rasputinator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:57:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've always liked the Sabbath ones. It's a good way of discovering new bands and hearing very abstract, although sometimes not the best, covers. My favorite on this one is Space Witch's ""From Beyond"". It adds a little extra without deviating too much from the original."
doommetal,3cjerr,shane71998,2,Wed Jul 8 14:33:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I'm not really a huge fan of how they made death doom songs out of all of them, but oh well."
doommetal,3cjerr,HenryTM,2,Wed Jul 8 15:21:25 2015 UTC,Did you even listen to the album? I wouldn't classify a single one of those tracks as death doom.
doommetal,3cjerr,shane71998,2,Wed Jul 8 15:45:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did, and I guess the way we classify things is different then, don't take it personal."
doommetal,3cjerr,HenryTM,3,Wed Jul 8 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"I realize now how antagonistic that sounded, sorry. What song on the album would you say most reflects that sound?"
doommetal,3cjerr,shane71998,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:30:05 2015 UTC,"It's all good man, and really my main gripe was that they took the whole chill hypnotic vibe and kind of gave it a funeral-doom feel. Mainly Dragonaut, I just don't get the kind of groovey stoned out jam feel I got from the original, and I felt that the vocals being harsher, while I normally wouldn't mind, didn't do that much justice. I don't think its bad at all, I'm just not too crazy about it."
doommetal,3cjerr,WingedCrown,2,Wed Jul 8 18:42:30 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly with Dragonaut.  Liked the cover until the vocals came on.
doommetal,3cjerr,HenryTM,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:46:04 2015 UTC,"I personally loved it, but I do get that. I saw it as more of an OM like take, rather than funeral, the difference being not in tempo but in tone, which is what put me off Funeral for a while."
doommetal,3cjerr,WeedFinderGeneral,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:03:39 2015 UTC,Now we just need to wait for those Earache reissues to ship.
doommetal,3cjerr,AcesCreed2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:04:17 2015 UTC,I recently got an email that said they shipped 6/29.
doommetal,3cjerr,WeedFinderGeneral,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:18:43 2015 UTC,"Really?  I haven't, but they've been terrible with emails.  One of my friends bought it, and still hasn't gotten any of the emails about the delays.  Edit: I just checked, and its the shipping from the vinyl presser to the label. I haven't heard anything confirming the records being shipped to us."
doommetal,3cjerr,AcesCreed2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"Oh. I totally misread that. Shit, at this rate we'll get them by the time Sleep puts out another record."
doommetal,3cjerr,BlackArtsTattooer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:51:20 2015 UTC,Yeah the last email I got from them said that they planned on shipping like weekend before last if everything went well with the pressing and then I never heard anything from them again.
doommetal,3cl25o,linqua,8,Wed Jul 8 19:10:23 2015 UTC,"That's interesting but I kind of disagree. I think the more gothic/depressive/blackened and funeral doom steers far away from this in some cases. Not all but many, hard to think of examples since I mostly prefer stoner and classic doom. interesting question to raise though and it's nice to see a little more discussion on here."
doommetal,3cl25o,nerfherder1991,2,Wed Jul 8 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"Yes I would also agree to that. The Gothic more Candlemas or melancholic influenced doom I would say doesn't have the stoner feel I'm picking up on, but most of all of the other ones do. I think it's something inherent to the huge fuzziness of the guitar and down tempo style. You know?"
doommetal,3cl25o,ashoegazer,2,Wed Jul 8 20:35:35 2015 UTC,Nah. Only the stuff rooted in blues rock really has that. The Sexuality of Bereavement doesn't strike me as the best soundtrack to a night in with the Devil's Lettuce.
doommetal,3cl25o,agonistcandi,3,Wed Jul 8 20:48:18 2015 UTC,I see where you guys are coming from but I agree with some of the other comments. A good example would be My Dying Bride. That shit is doomy as fuck and not in the least bit stonerish.
doommetal,3cl25o,agonistcandi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:44:38 2015 UTC,Yes that is what I'm saying in the exceptions haha
doommetal,3cl25o,littlecrab,2,Wed Jul 8 22:51:10 2015 UTC,Lol fuck I'm high. Sorry I didn't catch that bit. My apologies. But yeah man.
doommetal,3cl25o,Yuli-Ban,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:23:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah the thing I'm talking about is a bit more subtle than maybe it sounded in the first one. I can kind of see it both ways, the down tempo fuzziness doesn't have to be stonery but I could easily, and personally by default perceive it that way. It's interesting because even though there have been a few replies the opinions seem pretty varied. The depressive stuff I don't really see it though. Not trying to get stoned listening to swallow the sun haha"
doommetal,3cl25o,funkmasterjambo666,3,Wed Jul 8 23:39:40 2015 UTC,"To me, 'stoner' and 'doom' are almost two separate genres in terms of 'feeling' (although yaa, were probably more similar in the past). Personally I don't actually like 'stoner doom' too much, or at least, not when I'm in a doomy mood (which seems to be most of the time), and there are some things that get posted to this sub that I don't really get a doomy feeling from at all. To me, stoner-doom is all about kicking back, lighting up a spliff and feeling good about the world while getting lost in the riffs, whereas the doom  I like, and what I actually call 'doom' isn't about feeling good at all. It's more like getting overwhelmed darkness and despair that makes you not want to leave your house, and also about getting lost in introspection. Maybe it even comes from your personality in a way, and you could have too bands that sound musically similar (slow heavy riffs, loud guitars etc. all the things we love about doom), and it could be interpreted as doomy or stonerish depending on not just how you feel at the time, but which way your personality leans. That probably sounds like I'm high, but I'm really just tired.  It's funny though, as right now I saw this thread while listening to Bong's 'Stoner Rock' album, which I find way more doomy than stonerish (I think because it’s so introspective), despite both the band and album name. But then, maybe to someone feeling in a stonerish mood, it makes a perfect smoking companion. Good question OP, it’s pretty cool to think about these things."
doommetal,3cl25o,Lankles,3,Thu Jul 9 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"yeah i agree with most of what you said, good post. youre right it can vary depending on your mood etc. Windhand i think is just a really good example of this relativity. perhaps doom is just likely to take on this type of nature because of how it is.   that said, i do like listening to evil sounding music while stoned  also haha."
doommetal,3cl25o,essentialsalts,2,Thu Jul 9 06:01:19 2015 UTC,"Traditional doom metal, you can make an argument for that. Once you get into the extreme subgenres [death, funeral, drone], you've lost it. You can say, ""You can still get stoned to it!"" but that applies to all music. People get stoned to emo music."
doommetal,3cgomr,stevesesti,4,Tue Jul 7 19:42:39 2015 UTC,I have to admit I was slightly disappointed by Thou's version. I was hoping they would use some clean vocals and guitars at least in the beginning to really capture the dread of the song.  That said the song is absolutely killer anyway and I talked to Brian last summer before it came out and he said the band weren't really big Shellac fans and were taking a while to figure the song out.
doommetal,3cgomr,HoovesCarveCraters,2,Tue Jul 7 21:25:33 2015 UTC,You saying that reminds me of how much I appreciate their 4th of July cover. Those clean vocals on top of the almost subtle harsh ones was a real treat.
doommetal,3cgomr,Dividan84,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:04:51 2015 UTC,Liturgy's version is pretty interesting.

doommetal,3c1lri,DracoKingOfDragonMen,3,Sat Jul 4 03:58:37 2015 UTC,That's awful. Good song though. I think the Soundgarden version counts as doom on it's own.
doommetal,3c1lri,worthlessfucksunited,2,Sat Jul 4 03:29:16 2015 UTC,"I LOVE the original song ""4th of July"" by Soundgarden. In fact it's one of my all time favorite Soundgarden songs and I'm a big fan of them. But I think that's why I can't really get into this. It's just hard to hear one of my favorite songs changed so drastically. That said, this cover didn't sound too bad until the harsh vocals came in. Ruins the feel of the song imo, it's too noisy. I don't think this song needed a doom cover."
doommetal,3c1lri,MeshuggahIsLife,2,Sat Jul 4 05:43:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, I love the original and most of Thou's work, including a lot of their covers. But the mixed clean and harsh vocals don't work for me on this one."

doommetal,3c1lri,catonaleash,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:23:12 2015 UTC,Great band. Met one of them in a record store down in New Orleans a few years back. Super chill guy. Talked to him for a while about how he wanted to play a show on a raft in the middle of a lake.
doommetal,3c1lri,Call-the-cops-IDGAF,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:52:42 2015 UTC,Decent cover. The vocals kinda killed it for me though.

doommetal,3c17vn,TheNaXho_D,4,Fri Jul 3 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean - this song is really incredible and for me probably my favourite of theirs. For me, maybe the emotion of this song is only matched by their other song Adrift In The Ocean. YOB are really on a level of their own, so you've made this hard on yourself. Maybe you could try some other bands that stand out and give you goosebumps like YOB do, for me that would probably be Pallbearer and Thou. That's just my opinion though."
doommetal,3c17vn,rhinestoneBones,2,Sat Jul 4 01:56:10 2015 UTC,Great suggestions man! Just heard the first song of the pallbearer album and its just what i was looking for. Tnx!
doommetal,3c17vn,SoUglyEveryoneDied,2,Sat Jul 4 17:35:35 2015 UTC,Bongripper -  Miserable is made up of three tracks and is an hour and 5 mins long. Dark doomy and ambient at times instrumental.

Both bands have such a thick tone and on these tracks to me it's like they've just restrained that heaviness instead of stripping it away, so these slow jams are able to somehow sound absolutely massive whilst being gorgeous and melodious. I think a lot of Metal fans agree that Marrow was the best song of 2014."

As far as other bands, that's a bit hard. There's Middian for more of the same stuff. Warning (Watching From a Distance-era) and 40 Watt Sun do similarly emotional-type songs, though the sound is different."
doommetal,3c285i,imhungryn0w,2,Sat Jul 4 02:09:41 2015 UTC,I love this album and song. The cover art is killer too!

doommetal,3brx3x,MythicalMothman,2,Wed Jul 1 19:19:20 2015 UTC,"Same here. I was hoping they'd be returning to the sound of their earlier days with the new album, but apparently this won't be the case. Bummer."

doommetal,3brx3x,Shaggyforeman,2,Thu Jul 2 02:56:31 2015 UTC,So they took some acid and chilled out a bit. Even if it isn't as hard or fast as their older albums it's still sounds good and has that The Sword grove to it. I approve.
doommetal,3brx3x,imhungryn0w,2,Thu Jul 2 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"I like it.  More of a 70s hard rock vibe here, but I'm OK with that.  If you ever get a chance to see them live, I recommend it.  They put on a very good show even though they seem to attract more of a bro crowd these days.  Last year I saw them in Boston and morons were moshing the entire time, but the music still made up for that annoyance."
doommetal,3brx3x,WingedCrown,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:53:01 2015 UTC,"It's not what I was expecting, but I do like it.  Seems to be stoner rock rather than their normal stoner/doom metal."

doommetal,3b2eey,NotAloneInMyBasement,2,Fri Jun 26 02:13:26 2015 UTC,"Well, there's of course the evergreen and fairly well known Reverend Bizarre, which is considered the first (and by some, the best) Finnish doom metal band. Spiritus Mortis comes to mind, too, since it was started few years earlier than Reverend, but Reverend released their first album earlier than them.  Thergothon is often quoted as one of the hallmark bands of funeral doom.  But all in all, Mana Mana was a sort of a proto-doom band, because they labelled themselves as a mix of punk and metal - but as you can hear from the song, it has a very hard and slow feeling to it. Jouni Mömmö (basically the one behind all of Mana Mana) was a weird and troubled person, and is often quoted as a man ahead of his time. Unfortunately due to his schizophrenia, he overdosed on prescription meds in the early 90s."

doommetal,3ave6n,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,2,Tue Jun 23 22:44:14 2015 UTC,"How slow? Funeral doom has growl vocals mostly and crushing sound. Try some Ahab, first two albums. Or one of my favorites by Esoteric, the album Subconscious Dissolution into the Continuum.   A bit faster? Try out Swallow the Sun's debut album. That would be death/doom.     How about the newest Triptykon? That should be in your comfort zone with a lot of death metal and many slow, crushing doom parts as well.    There's some to get you started at least. Try searching in this sub. There are a dozen of fantastic posts with really awesome lists for inspiration."
doommetal,3ave6n,Ariaji,2,Tue Jun 23 21:16:35 2015 UTC,"If you like death metal and Sleep, then the bands you need to listen to are:  Warhorse (not the 70's band):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzOovR0S1uk  YOB:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5eadgIsY1U  Demonic Death Judge:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l743v8OKB9s  These bands are typically considered stoner/doom, like Sleep, but they have more death metal growls.

Cos you're worth it.   ""What's so special about Runemagick? They sound like some gay Tolkien power metal thing,"" is what you're going to exclaim aloud for the benefit of this post. And you're wrong. But it's okay because now you get to listen to Runemagick. This is the best day of your life.  Runemagick are/were/will one day be again a Swedish power trio who played Stockholm style death metal with a Bolt Thrower influence back when everyone had given way to Gothenberg melody in the late 90s, and over like a million albums forged a sweet as fuck (the sweetest as fuck) death/doom sound with big riffs, fancy drums and the mother of all bass tones. And FUCKING GROWLS. They walk a line between stoner death and crippled turtle death.   Do you like OSDM? Start with Supreme Force of Eternity and work your way through from the start. Otherwise jump in with Darkness Death Doom and follow the smoke to the tremolo filled land. Dawn of the End, their last album, takes up a really strong stoner influence which is awesome.  I'll get into a knife fight with anyone who doesn't think Runemagick make the best death/doom. I'll give it to the likes of Winter and Hooded Menace, or Bolt Thrower or Celtic Frost, but they've just go so many albums of beautiful fuckin' evil death/doom drawing from different ends of the style. It's so good.   They're death/doom's best kept secret cos they're a studio band more than anything. Let Runemagick into your heart.   (And their frontman's other band, Funeral Orchestra, is also 10/10 would cut myself in the snow to again)"

I used to listen to a lot of death metal and grindcore (eg: Deicide, Cryptopsy, Brujeria, etc), but as I got into slower tempos they were one of the bands that appealed to me most. Their stuff is hard to find, but they are a little sludge, a little death, a little blues, and a little Southern gothic."

Sinister Haze leaves on our 4 week tour out to Psycho California in support of the new Betrayed by Time EP on Heavy Slab Records. The lineup is incredible and as many of you well know Cough will also be performing out at Psycho in May. It's been awhile since hearing from us so now seems as good a time as any to tell everyone we will be recording our 3rd full length later this year. To those who haven't heard the haze check out Noisey and theObelisk today or CvltNation on tuesday. I couldn't be more stoked on everything and to see everyone this May.

doommetal,3amzht,BadDreamInc,2,Sun Jun 21 21:12:57 2015 UTC,"Personally I wouldn't describe Wandering Midget as Prog, it's not particularly progressive, just long Trad Funeral Doom. Similar bands would be Serpent Warning (same singer on first record), Lord Vicar, Garden of Worm, Seremonia, Minotauri, Spiritus Mortis, and of course the high kings of the genre, Reverend Bizarre. It's worth checking out the whole Finnish Doom scene, still producing some of the best underground doom.  Italy is good on this stuff too, check out Paul Chain (Detaching from Satan is a good start point). In the way of more Prog doom I would listen to While Heaven Weapt, Confessor, and maybe the 3rd Reverend Bizarre album: So Long Suckers, definitely has some prog influence.   There was an older thread on the same topic, most of the bands suggested are not my cup of tea, but may be useful.   https://reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/2m0dkf/any_suggestions_for_progressive_doom_metal_or/"
doommetal,3amzht,subcomcwiii,2,Mon Jun 22 14:44:29 2015 UTC,Ancestors - doesn't really sound like Wandering Midget but i'd call this proggy. Maybe check out Crypt Sermon for more traditional doom

doommetal,3adild,ashoegazer,3,Sat Jun 20 02:16:14 2015 UTC,Jucifer are a husband and wife duo who travel across the States in an RV with a wall of amps. The thing they're really good at is having a crushing low end with soft vocals over the top. ('Centralia' and 'The Mountain'.) Their last two albums are a lot heavier than their older stuff with a strong black metal influence. Start with Calling All Cars on the Vegas Strip or If Thine Enemy Hunger
doommetal,3acefq,Flognickin,6,Thu Jun 18 23:33:06 2015 UTC,Seems High on Fire would be a natural fit here.
doommetal,3acefq,etherreal,2,Fri Jun 19 18:12:56 2015 UTC,This. I recently heard their new album for the first time. Hadn't listened to them before. People kept describing them as doom but I rather thought it felt like thrash. I could hear some resemblance of what could be doom so I settled on defining it as doom thrash however odd that sounds.

doommetal,3acefq,Okawaru,3,Fri Jun 19 16:12:03 2015 UTC,"Confessor pretty much play slowed down technical thrash metal with falsetto vocals, although its pretty atypical to normal doom. Doom/Thrash is kind of an oxymoron, as they are pretty much polar opposite subgenres."
doommetal,3acefq,tidesofblood88,3,Fri Jun 19 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say sludge metal comes close as a doom/thrash mix, but utilizing more the raw, punk/hardcore side of thrash than the more new wave of British heavy metal side. High On Fire for one, as already pointed out. Honey Bucket by The Melvins for example also.   The best bands I think tend to involve guys who have different backgrounds coming together and making something. Don't just split it down the middle or try to have a specific intent on genre."

They were signed because they are young black kids playing metal, which is ""interesting"" which bugs me because obviously they should only be judged by their music and race should have nothing to do with anything, it makes me feel like Sony thinks of them as a carnival show than a musical act, and from what I've heard they are/were trying to get out of their contract because that's how Sony is treating them  Damn shame, I bet these kids could have gotten really good on their own, but I feel a huge label messing things up like this will probably mess things up before they get a chance to really develop as musicians and a band."

doommetal,39hwro,ShutteredIn,3,Fri Jun 12 15:08:42 2015 UTC,Was at the last two UK shows. Such incredible live performances. Everybody should go watch them if they get the chance.  Looking forward to seeing them play at the south bank with Phurpa in August
doommetal,39hwro,TraineeHipster,2,Thu Jun 11 23:08:53 2015 UTC,I was at the Southwest Terrorfest show in AZ and I will gladly pitch 5 bucks to be able to relive that night. Awesome.
doommetal,39hwro,slasherflick2243,3,Fri Jun 12 10:41:54 2015 UTC,Absolutely unreal. I caught them in Manchester (UK) when they played last and it was the most intense weird experience ever. Cannot recommend enough.
doommetal,39hwro,turkboy,3,Fri Jun 12 11:07:08 2015 UTC,I'll get hated on for this but seeing sunn was one of the only times I fell asleep standing up. It was interesting tho. Can definitely say in a bigger fan of Andersons other projects Goatsnake and Burning Witch

doommetal,39ieut,sgorthy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:29:57 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, he threw out the original two members so that he could have his way over the direction of the band. Which musically was good, Whitchcult Today and Time to Die are brilliant, but it seems kinad dickey to me.  But don't quote me on that, I'm not to big on the situation."
doommetal,39ieut,Todd_the_odd,2,Tue Jun 16 09:35:14 2015 UTC,"from what I understand about the situation, Jus didn't pay him because A. he didn't write anything, he just recorded what was presented to him B. he wasn't listed as the foundation of the band on the Spinefarm contract.. Liz & Jus are the only consistent members, which Jus has said in many many interviews .. the only things being publically stated about this ordeal is from Greening.. and he's making it a public issue by denying the fans access to the Album.. the Band can still tour and make a killing off of the Merch that Greening has no rights to.. so he's really only screwing himself at this point .."
doommetal,39ieut,doomtroll1978,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"So just to be clear, did he get paid anything for playing on the album, or just not as much as he would've liked? I can see Jus not wanting to give him an equal percentage as everyone else (and arguably a cut from merchandise sales), but he can't just get nothing."
doommetal,39ieut,Vargas_Larson,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:33:09 2015 UTC,that really depends on contracts.. so unless we're given access to them (which considering it's a legal battle we're not going to) we'll not likely know until the shit settles

doommetal,39ieut,noober98,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:32:21 2015 UTC,I was a denier for so long.  EW single handedly shaped my taste in music.  I tried to like We Live.  Witchcult Today gave me hope.  With every new album I clutch onto the hope that will reclaim that sludgey doom sounds that made them.  It will never happen.  They play dress up and act like they play heavy...  but they don't.    Even Jus has stated they are a pop band.  My heart sunk so low when I read that.  Go here for full context:  http://www.occultrock.com/2014/10/interview-electric-wizards-jus-oborn.html  15 years later and I'm finally starting to understand that EW isn't for me.

doommetal,390l4z,Jabbatheslann,2,Mon Jun 8 23:28:30 2015 UTC,Dude I was there too! They nailed their atmosphere perfectly.
doommetal,390l4z,supersonicdeathsquad,9,Mon Jun 8 23:40:39 2015 UTC,Cool. Fucking love Witch Mountain.
doommetal,390l4z,MythicalMothman,7,Mon Jun 8 12:07:00 2015 UTC,Blood Ceremony is one of my absolute favorite bands and I've been listening to Ruby the Hatchet a lot lately; there are plenty of others I've been planning to check out but I didn't realize there were this many!
doommetal,390l4z,PompousTaintHammer,3,Mon Jun 8 16:27:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you are like me or not, but I really liked Blood Ceremony and just recently got into Mount Salem.  The singer has this haunting vocal quality, and musically it reminded me of Blood Ceremony.  Definitely worth a look."

doommetal,390l4z,WeedFinderGeneral,3,Tue Jun 9 03:31:33 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I've seen them live, and trust me, it's a woman.  Also, she has an awesome solo album out now."

I love it. It's neither Doom or Stoner - more like something inbetween?! It's pretty fast, too. And no bass guitar. It might not be exactly what you're looking for, but it's damn good."
doommetal,390l4z,Mattman15,3,Mon Jun 8 19:12:51 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for posting this! Instantly became my favorite band. Incredibly creative and full of power. They're known as Vodun now.

The best female fronted doom bands are Acid King, Avatarium, Blood Ceremony, Jex Thoth, Mount Salem, Ruby the Hatchet, and Subrosa. And though they aren't exactly doom, Blues Pills and Electric Citizen are pretty cool too."

doommetal,38xtsp,lkultra,4,Sun Jun 7 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"I think that you guys shouldn't have constant repeats of albums if you can't figure out new selections. If you can only find fifteen new albums, I don't need to keep seeing Saturndust, Acid King, Monolord, and Elder- just give me the fifteen albums.   That being said, I'd much rather have your website than not- I'm pretty good at finding all of the actual doom before you guys do month by month, but I've got some cool stoner rock from you that I never would have found at my own, and not everyone scours the metal-archives for promising new releases like I do."
doommetal,38xtsp,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,2,Sun Jun 7 21:19:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty good at finding all of the actual doom before you guys do month by month, but I've got some cool stoner rock from you that I never would have found at my own, and not everyone scours the metal-archives for promising new releases like I do.   I agree with this sentiment. I am constantly looking for new doom and stoner, and what I don't find, /u/TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP finds for me, and what neither of us find usually shows up in the Doom Charts. Great resource for this subgenre to have, and I want to thank you guys immensely for doing what you do.  Case in point: That Brume album opened up a portal of lesser demons in my stereo, and it's a goddamned good thing I am moving because this house is now possessed. I wouldn't have found the album (at least not yet) if it hadn't been in the June chart."
doommetal,38xtsp,banjaxe,2,Mon Jun 8 02:33:54 2015 UTC,Great article! Lot's of cool underground stuff to check out \m/

As someone who doesn't have the time I once had to scour the net for new stuff, this is a great resource to see what is worth checking out. I've been listening to Dopethrone & Elder non-stop the past few months thanks to this site, both of which I would not have known about otherwise. I hope they keep going with this because IMO it is fantastic."

Along with the other /r/music thing about some black kid finding Come My Fanatics on the ground it's as if someone in Electric Wizard tried some form of viral marketing. If so it worked, too."
doommetal,38myv7,ashoegazer,2,Fri Jun 5 09:08:21 2015 UTC,Did that end up being a hoax? I remember thinking it sounded so cheesy but I pretty much forgot about it.
doommetal,38myv7,rvlution,3,Fri Jun 5 14:01:42 2015 UTC,"I don't remember hearing anything about either of them either way. I mean, they're both weird stories, but entirely plausible.   One of my favorite /r/metal moments was when a guy came over from /r/hiphopheads saying he wanted to check out some metal and see what it's about. With the help of the sub, he compiled a playlist of albums, and listened to one a day for a week and wrote a track-by-track review; it was awesome.  So really, the only thing that makes the two stories you referenced in-credible, is that it's black guys who like metal. Out of the norm, sure, but not unbelievable. If my mom, a 60-something year old white lady, can listen to and enjoy ...And Justice for All, I don't see why some old black poet couldn't find something to like about Electric Wizard."
doommetal,38myv7,bruce656,3,Fri Jun 5 15:53:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see why some old black poet couldn't find something to like about Electric Wizard.   It wasn't so much this as the WOW OMG OLD PEOPLE LIKE METAL circlejerk that exploded to nuclear proportions within like 5 minutes. That combined with the dude's cringeworthy ""poetry"" just made that thread a complete cesspool. And on top of that, the fact that it hit /r/bestof meant that a bunch of complete morons showed up and just started naming their favorite bands. There was one dude who recommended Behemoth and called it occult doom. I mean, come on."

doommetal,38myv7,bruce656,3,Fri Jun 5 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's definitely plausible, I'm not doubting that. My dad's a 60 year old Indian man and he jams sabbath from time to time. But that thread was just...bleh"

doommetal,38myv7,bruce656,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:30:27 2015 UTC,"His claim that he caught Hendrix at Woodstock and his cringe inducing sixth-form ""poetry"" threw any credibility out the window.   Which is a shame because the idea of an old blues head getting really into doom and sludge and the like is really cool. That's how loads of people here got into doom. They heard songs like this and this and saw it wasn't a million miles away from the music they grew up with. I bet loads of people in that thread thought the same thing."

It's pure validation seeking behavior from total strangers, which from a 60+ year old guy who has seen some shit? Makes no sense. Unless you're whoring out for karma and lulz.

He was just hanging out at the merch table and I don't think many folks realized it was him... Earth were the support act, for Sunn O))), and I think a lot of the audience was there because Sunn were being hyped at the time. It was a very scenester gig."

One Bast shirt plus some patches too."

doommetal,387yr8,LifesABowlofJerrys,0,Tue Jun 2 15:39:00 2015 UTC,I know that; I just mean that bands that would like to replicate Sabbath's sound (i.e. Orchid) seem like they only use the psychedelic blues aspect and ignore the swing influences that Ward and Iommi  brought.
doommetal,387yr8,imhungryn0w,2,Tue Jun 2 15:56:11 2015 UTC,"And some do, it's just most of the doom/stoner/sludge scene wants to do what they want to do. Not just play constant homage to Sabbath."

Camel of Doom - EarthHammer Camel of Doom - King Dragon   Edit 2:  If you're more after a free/experimental jazz feeling, there's very obviously Bohren und der Club of Gore, notably Black Earth and also The Mount Fuji Doomjazz Corporation which is the darker side of The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble (for the latter, it mostly won't fit except Nothing Changes).

I said when that one came out that they needed to go back to basics, and it seems like this was somewhat of a step in that direction (though obviously I haven't heard the whole album yet). Definitely a heavier, more modern sound than Opus Eponymous, which is fine, but part of the charm of this band for me was the ""vintage"" sound they had and I wish they had recaptured that a little more on the 2nd album, and now this one. But overall, it's a song with catchy melodies, evil lyrics, and killer riffs, which are the most important things. It got me excited though, and I can't wait to hear the rest."

doommetal,37nt62,Yellowbenzene,1 point,Fri May 29 07:25:19 2015 UTC,"Did Iced Earth ever do anything doomy?  Loads of the big doom bands from the 90s came from death and grindcore roots. Cathedral came from Napalm Death, My Dying Bride from Abiosis, Solstice from Sore Throat, Electric Wizard from Thy Grief Eternal etc etc. Even Sleep from Asbestos Death.  So there's a gothic aesthetic in a lot of doom bands (Type O Negative really played this up and sold millions of records) but all of the big goth doom bands started with some death metal influence.  Essential bands: The Gathering (early), Anathema (early), Paradise Lost (early), My Dying Bride (whenever really), Tiamat, Katatonia (early), Type O Negative, Celtic Frost (especially Monotheist), Triptykon, Moonspell (early)  The Bitterness and the Bereavement has the saddest intro of all time."
doommetal,37nt62,ashoegazer,1 point,Fri May 29 12:20:52 2015 UTC,Gothic metal is metal taking hints from goth rock or other goth metal type stuff. Definitely doesn't mean what you're talking about.
doommetal,37nt62,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,1 point,Sat May 30 07:15:38 2015 UTC,"Not really sure what exactly defines 'gothic doom', but bands clumped into it like My Dying Bride, Katatonia, Paradise Lost and Tiamat often have synths/keyboards, melancholic lyrics and a mixture of both clean vocals and growls. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p1pB80bjcE"
doommetal,37nt62,Okawaru,1 point,Fri May 29 02:48:04 2015 UTC,"All these tracks and there respective albums are pretty solid, not necessarily ""essentials"" to the genre, but a few that got me personally into the genre.  Sentenced - Cross My Heart and Hope to Die  The Foreshadowing - Departure  Amorphis - The White Swan  Paradise Lost - Never for the Damned  The Eternal - Everlasting  Rainshadow - Omega  Katatonia - My Twin  October Tide - Custodian of Science  Daylight Dies - Cathedral  Rapture - Misery 24/7  All of these have clean vocals besides the final 3 on the list, depending on what you're into. Within gothic metal, there is quite a variety, but this should give you something to work with. Happy listening!"

doommetal,37mxyo,bruce656,1 point,Fri May 29 14:44:30 2015 UTC,"What I did when I wanted to make a Slough Feg wall flag was to email the band and ask for permission to do it. They gave me the go ahead and, while I never got around to it, you could take the same route- just buy some Sleep merch online if you feel bad still. They have enough variants of their shirts that I'm sure there are a couple that you don't have."

It's the damn insides art I can't find anywhere and I was hoping to get it to scale to the size of the sleeve unfolded.

doommetal,37j7ue,MaxRenn,3,Thu May 28 16:54:53 2015 UTC,"Before it started bands were dropping out or having trouble. Because of the venues no reentry policy I decided to only see a few bands everyday. Now I've been to psycho all but one year and know the venue well, so I had all my shit planned in December. First the venue  booked another show on the first day and that made it very confusing where the other stage and merch table were. I found the merch area on the second day (thanks reddit) and most things were sold out by then. Bands lack of volume was a big issue in the outdoor stage. Time changes on the last day and their inability to communicate it effectively/coherently completely ruined that day for me. Drink prices were fucking insane. Three day pass holders got a paper bracelet on the first day and were told it was our responsibility to keep it safe.  The positives were the smaller outdoor stage, despite all its shortcomings, had an amazing vibe if you were right at front. Pits were tight, food trucks were awesome, and what merch they had was reasonably priced. Security was far less pervy this year, and they did eventually give us a better bracelet for the event."
doommetal,37j7ue,etherreal,2,Thu May 28 17:24:29 2015 UTC,"Security was pretty top notch really.  And once in a lifetime performance by Wino and Bedemon, not to mention a surprise 2 hour set by Sleep, and the overall lineup definitely overshadowed all of those things for me.  IMO the worst part was not putting Elder on the main stage."
doommetal,37j7ue,solarian132,1 point,Thu May 28 23:25:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I honestly haven't heard much Elder and was looking forward to checking them out, but the crowd spilling out of that small room was insane.  I was so stoked on the festival as a whole, though. I can barely imagine a better line up. All the sets I checked out were great, be it in the pit or from afar high as balls. And finally got to see Old Man Gloom. Watching their set now gives me chills. God damn!"
doommetal,37j7ue,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,1 point,Fri May 29 01:19:24 2015 UTC,"God, Elder's sound in the tiny room was horrible, too. Way too much bass- from where I was standing, at least, the guitar wasn't really audible, and that's a death sentence for a band as reliant on their leads as Elder is. I was very, very sad about it."
doommetal,37j7ue,etherreal,1 point,Sat May 30 18:21:08 2015 UTC,"I thought so too, and I thought maybe because it was because I was stuck on the far left side at the stage... Was definitely bummed I couldn't hear vocals or leads..."
doommetal,37j7ue,TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP,1 point,Sat May 30 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"Nope. I was just a bit to the left of the sound guy in the back (standing on the couches- great spot, aside from the sound) and couldn't hear shit- I was fucking mad about it, since Elder was the non-headliner I was the most excited about other than Bedemon. So annoyed that I couldn't hear anything."

doommetal,37hwa6,leventc,2,Wed May 27 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"can also be done on standard scale guitars.  pelican uses standard scale lengths for B standard.  Thick strings help for intonation. I use a 30"" scale for drop G (three steps above std bass), but it's not ""required"""
doommetal,37hwa6,ben_hurt,1 point,Thu May 28 19:45:17 2015 UTC,One guy uses a les paul copy which is standard Gibson scale length. The other guy plays a seven string I think. I'm not sure the scale length but I don't think it is baritone scale length.
doommetal,37hwa6,dazedbyday,5,Wed May 27 22:02:57 2015 UTC,"I use an octave tuning, which is essentially Drop B tuning, with the low string tuned down to an octave F#. It just takes a really sturdy guitar (preferably neck thru), and thick ass strings.  I use Kalium strings sized 14, 18, 28, 39, 49, 67.  I forget the exact sizes of the bass, but I know its 45-150 (5 string fender jazz with upgraded pups).   Video here, I do bass/vocals in it."

Standard tuning on that stupid thing is, from high to low  E  B  G  D  A  E  B  F#  Some times I drop tune the F# to E so I can have the full range of a bass and guitar in one. Doesn't sound the same but its pretty meaty."

doommetal,37hwa6,bruce656,1 point,Fri May 29 03:52:32 2015 UTC,I put D'Addario strings (13-62) two standard scale guitars (Fender Strat and ESP LTD w/ Floyd Rose) and easily get a good low B tuning (ESP is much more forgiving regarding staying in tune due to locking nut/fine tuners).  D'Addario makes even thicker strings (14-68) but you'll probably need to modify the low 'E' string peg as the 62ga string on mine are just skinny enough.
doommetal,37hg74,sacredserenity,2,Wed May 27 17:40:16 2015 UTC,You had me at sludge with female vocals. Too bad they're broken up. Can't really find anything on them. Wanted to buy album.

And for the drug thing: What I have seen from past recordings and this documentary, where he almost couldn't talk or stand, even if he's using again, he's doing something really different than before. He was really fit, his voice was great and his mind seemed very clear and ""present"".   I know there is a lot of people where you just don't get the drugs out of them (see Ozzy) no matter what happens and no matter how much they assure that it's over. But the way he talks about drugs ""In the past it all was about the altered state of mind. But now it’s uncomfortable for me to be altered, and I want a comfort zone of some sort."" is very familiar to me from times when I drank too much, smoked too much weed and also from a friend of mine, who is now 36 and never got off the drugs from ages 14 to 30. To me that clearly sounds like someone fed up with losing control."

doommetal,371x9f,banjaxe,3,Sun May 24 04:28:03 2015 UTC,"He simply wouldn't be able to perform if he was on the drugs again (he has a track record for sucking badly when he is off on a bender).  Having seen footage of him after gigs, I can say he gets a massive (and rather giddy) high from the adrenalin of performing. The problem, however, is getting him down from that so he doesn't burn himself out. This, coincidentally, is a common problem with lead singers."

Being able to write a riff where no two meters have the same time signature is impressive as hell. And on top of that the riff is fucking massive. And then when that riff is over they immediately switch to another even more enormous (albeit not quite as technically impressive).

doommetal,366n4t,amouthforwar,1 point,Sun May 17 15:03:04 2015 UTC,"Didn't expect the 2ish hour set. Sooo good. Fun fact. They played more songs on a shorter set the last couple times I saw them, heh."
doommetal,366h1l,thebentunit,3,Sat May 16 16:54:17 2015 UTC,Definitely checkout Blackout. They're a three piece band based out of Brooklyn. Super heavy. Released their debut album this year through RisingEasy Records.   https://blackout666.bandcamp.com
doommetal,366h1l,bevinklanco,2,Sat May 16 17:15:14 2015 UTC,"Ha yeah, I know those guys well actually.  They played the first Sludgefeast which I booked last year.  Awesome band.  I think they just played Psycho, CA yesterday.  Great to see them starting to take off!"
doommetal,366h1l,bevinklanco,2,Sat May 16 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"They really are blowing up! I feel like that's what happens when you sign to Riding Easy. Wish I was at Psycho, CA right now."
doommetal,366h1l,Skinbeater,2,Sat May 16 17:59:22 2015 UTC,Check out Hush. They hail from Albany and have an incredibly heavy sound. They're actually opening for Conan and Mantar on their NYC date this week.  https://hushdoom.bandcamp.com/
doommetal,366h1l,WeedFinderGeneral,1 point,Mon May 18 06:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yup, Hush is great.  Bummed that I'll be out of town this Friday, otherwise I'd definitely be going to that show."
doommetal,366h1l,WeedFinderGeneral,1 point,Mon May 18 12:49:22 2015 UTC,"Syracuse University checking in, need some local shows"
doommetal,366h1l,sma92176us,1 point,Sat May 16 17:11:03 2015 UTC,Are you asking on behalf of a band?
doommetal,366h1l,palmmoot,1 point,Sat May 16 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"No, I need some shows to go to.  All Them Witches and The Well played a bit north of me during the winter, but that was it."
doommetal,366h1l,palmmoot,1 point,Sat May 16 18:38:13 2015 UTC,Isn't Geezer from NY?
doommetal,364xyf,imhungryn0w,4,Sat May 16 04:31:45 2015 UTC,Favourite OM song hands down
doommetal,364f7b,Marbas_The_Godcat,3,Sat May 16 01:08:24 2015 UTC,Great band. Not death/doom though.
doommetal,364f7b,palmmoot,2,Sat May 16 02:41:36 2015 UTC,If that's not folk doom metal than what is it?
doommetal,364f7b,Gabbaminchioni,3,Sat May 16 03:04:02 2015 UTC,"He said it's not death/doom, which it isn't."
doommetal,364f7b,PenetratorHammer,2,Sat May 16 03:17:47 2015 UTC,Not sure what you are driving at here. OP has them tagged as death/doom and they don't fit that description. Thus my comment.  I'm not trying to be a subgenre nazi but if I had to categorize Agalloch I guess it would be something stupid like blackened folk/doom.
doommetal,364f7b,palmmoot,2,Sat May 16 03:19:39 2015 UTC,"I see, I didn't read the tags so I thought you meant ""not death or doom"". Yeah my bad."
doommetal,364f7b,Gabbaminchioni,2,Sat May 16 12:00:50 2015 UTC,Out of the genre's that I can tag it as which one do you think most fits it?
doommetal,364f7b,palmmoot,2,Sat May 16 03:53:22 2015 UTC,"I guess black/doom if I had to choose.  Agalloch are one of those bands that cheerfully squirms out of any boxes you want to put them in. However, they are most definitely incorporating black metal influences into their music. Especially Ulver."
doommetal,364f7b,palmmoot,2,Sat May 16 04:07:57 2015 UTC,Thank you I'll change it to that. I just had no idea what genre it would be under.
doommetal,364f7b,faceman2k12,3,Sat May 16 04:16:00 2015 UTC,"That's cool, one could argue it doesn't really matter :)  Just for reference this is more representative of death/doom. Albeit one of the formative examples of the style.  I only really care about subgenres to the point that it helps me find music I like. If I know I like death/doom because of that band I just posted, it helps me find similar bands.  And then hey once I understand more about the elements at play maybe I stumble upon different branches off of those branches, like funeral doom from death/doom."
doommetal,364f7b,ThrndrMjgSglandi,2,Sat May 16 04:41:08 2015 UTC,"I always up vote agalloch, I've seen them in almost every music subreddit."
doommetal,364x4s,Marbas_The_Godcat,2,Sat May 16 04:21:39 2015 UTC,Shame they aren't brought up more often. So many good bands from this era.
doommetal,364x4s,palmmoot,2,Sat May 16 04:44:25 2015 UTC,I agree they are a great band and I think more people should listen to them. I was going to originally link Growers of mushroom (The song not the album) but to my surprise I could not find it on youtube.
doommetal,364x4s,palmmoot,2,Sat May 16 04:47:16 2015 UTC,That is rather surprising. I want to say that is the song that introduced me to them actually.
doommetal,364x4s,TheLegendofJoe,2,Sat May 16 04:53:55 2015 UTC,Same for me. That is the reason I wanted to post it (besides the fact that it is an awesome song.) I think I might start putting some songs up on Youtube from the Doom scene that aren't there so more people can start listening to it.
doommetal,364x4s,imhungryn0w,2,Sat May 16 04:58:16 2015 UTC,"Orange Goblin's cover of Freelance Fiend got me into them, what a band."
doommetal,364x4s,TheLegendofJoe,3,Sat May 16 16:45:56 2015 UTC,OG covered Freelance Fiend? Time for a music hunt. Cheers for the heads up dude.
doommetal,3651a8,Marbas_The_Godcat,2,Sat May 16 05:14:26 2015 UTC,"Very cool. They're from my town - I hadn't heard of them before seeing them at a local show, so it's cool to see that they're known on the internet."
doommetal,366sbj,Marbas_The_Godcat,4,Sat May 16 18:35:01 2015 UTC,wow what a deep cut. also this track isn't even close to doom metal.
doommetal,366sbj,PenetratorHammer,1 point,Sat May 16 22:33:05 2015 UTC,The ONE and ONLY Sabbath song I skip. This is all wrong for the green list.
doommetal,366sbj,lkultra,1 point,Sun May 17 19:10:42 2015 UTC,Still better than the version with Kelly eughh * shudders *
doommetal,364sto,Neurot5,3,Sat May 16 03:33:57 2015 UTC,Holy shit I hadn't heard :(
doommetal,364sto,palmmoot,3,Sat May 16 04:47:01 2015 UTC,Doom will never be the same. His worldly form might be gone but he still live through his music.
doommetal,36544b,Marbas_The_Godcat,2,Sat May 16 05:52:24 2015 UTC,Nice dude
doommetal,36544b,palmmoot,1 point,Mon May 18 07:00:12 2015 UTC,I thought I'd put it on YouTube. I really wanted to link it.
doommetal,3634ns,Cosmonaut_of_three,2,Fri May 15 18:22:22 2015 UTC,and i was there btw
doommetal,364cek,Bear_Masta,3,Sat May 16 00:39:46 2015 UTC,This is Mike Patton of Faith No More and Mr Bungle by the way.
doommetal,364cek,DhampirBoy,3,Sat May 16 02:07:15 2015 UTC,"Don't forget guitarist Buzz Osborne of the Melvins and drummer Dave Lombardo from Slayer. Trevor Dunn, also of Mr Bungle fame, is on bass."

doommetal,363qfo,Cosmonaut_of_three,1 point,Fri May 15 21:19:26 2015 UTC,This album and Dactylis Glomeratis or whatever the fuck it's called Glomerata are Candlemass' best. Weird doom rock with Hawkwind influences. Also a lot like Trouble's psychedelic stuff on Plastic Green Head and Manic Frustration.
doommetal,363qfo,ashoegazer,1 point,Sat May 16 14:04:26 2015 UTC,this album is called from the 13th sun. but yeah this and dactylis glomerata are the best candlemass albums

doommetal,362c5h,sacredserenity,2,Fri May 15 14:38:45 2015 UTC,Tasty
doommetal,35zzhb,PitBullTherapy,24,Thu May 14 22:54:42 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a problem I'd like to have."
doommetal,35zzhb,Lurkerantlers,16,Thu May 14 23:40:56 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you're having Sleep problems...
doommetal,35zzhb,vertigo3pc,8,Fri May 15 01:09:28 2015 UTC,I have the same problem. Frames are expensive :(
doommetal,35zzhb,iceman_in_black,3,Fri May 15 00:24:10 2015 UTC,Seriously! I had the first two done professionally but have since bought a mat cutter ( here is one of my first attempts.). You can order custom sized frames for relatively cheap online.
doommetal,35zzhb,redkennedy,4,Fri May 15 02:03:59 2015 UTC,I love that 3rd one. I bought one of the Aquarian shirts at the ACL show here in Austin but the graphic is not nearly as ridiculous
doommetal,35zzhb,AveLucifer,3,Fri May 15 00:21:04 2015 UTC,Your friends and family have gathered here today to help you by talking about your marijuana consumption...
doommetal,35zzhb,Pure_Fucking_Death,3,Fri May 15 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"Not exactly a terrible problem, but frames are expensive.  Also this makes me wish i got some more Sleep merch from the last tour."
doommetal,35zzhb,feedusfetusfajitas_,2,Fri May 15 00:56:22 2015 UTC,Nice! Roommate saw them in New Orleans. He snagged the diver and threw it up in our living room.
doommetal,35zzhb,ThatDerekGuy,2,Fri May 15 02:06:08 2015 UTC,Probably should've included this too http://imgur.com/6g1pk83 http://imgur.com/V3P13Sd
doommetal,35zzhb,Woodsie_Lord,2,Fri May 15 02:35:49 2015 UTC,Your problem is that you don't have enough sleep art.
doommetal,35zzhb,Quenter,2,Fri May 15 06:37:32 2015 UTC,"Hello. I'm a doctor and I see you have troubles with Sleep. May I recommend smoking some green herb and listening to Sleep so you could Sleep well? This worked wonders for other unfortunate patients who, like you, had problems with Sleep."
doommetal,35zzhb,Crow_The_Robot,1 point,Fri May 15 07:45:42 2015 UTC,Where can I find that Dopesmoker print?
doommetal,35zzhb,Crow_The_Robot,3,Fri May 15 01:39:54 2015 UTC,eBay. Pretty sure it may be unauthorized :-/ (I wasn't aware when I purchased)
doommetal,35zzhb,Crow_The_Robot,1 point,Fri May 15 01:47:23 2015 UTC,So how much was it to have the astronaut print framed? I got the Aquarian and figure it's the same size. Not looking forward to that cost. I have a few things that need to be framed and they are all fucking odd sizes. No running to Hobby Lobby for me.
doommetal,35zzhb,honeybear12345,1 point,Fri May 15 03:45:15 2015 UTC,Somewhere between 250-300. After that one I decided to learn to frame. Save a bunch cutting your own mats and ordering custom frames online.
doommetal,35zzhb,its_lance_mannion,1 point,Fri May 15 03:46:51 2015 UTC,How much does it cost to set up for cutting mats? It may be worth looking in to.
doommetal,35zzhb,Choodie,1 point,Fri May 15 04:22:27 2015 UTC,"I use one of these: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019IISD8/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_oIxvvb0HS2A7N). Additionally you'll need a pencil, straight edge, mats and artist tape is helpful. Edit: formatting"
