What I did when I bought up a few years ago was buy a bunch of units for 25-30€ each, coming with lots of accessories such as blank disks and joysticks, and repair them where they needed repair. There's a fool-proof TXT file in circulation that serves as a guide to identifying defective ICs and ROMs. I now have one C64C for ""everyday"" use, a working ""museal"" breadbox, and a breadbox that serves as a parts donor. When you look on Ebay, ask the seller if any ICs were removed from the board. You definitely don't want a unit that is missing anything. The good news is that most sellers are perfectly good-natured and just want to get rid of that box of old stuff from their attic."

c64,3cd4qf,drewmg,2,Mon Jul 6 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"Mach 5 is a disk drive accelerator and utility cartridge. I don't remember if that specific one has a monitor (sort of a disassembler/assembler for examining memory) or any other features (like game cheat or copy protection breaking features) but many of the disk accelerator cartridges did. Many also had some kind of disk shell to make disk tasks (like copying files, loading files, etc.) easier. I had a Mach 5, but it's been 25+ years, and I forget the details.  If you won't be using floppy disks, you won't find much use for it in modern times. The SD card disk drives all already load very fast (relatively speaking). Old floppies have proven themselves to not be terribly reliable after all this time...my C64 floppies were mostly defunct by the time I had another C64 to try them on. Even more recent and sturdy Amiga disks in my collection were about 50/50 dead. So, you're unlikely to do a lot of loading from floppy disks, unless you just really want the full experience.  Cartridges were never the dominant format for distributing games for C64. They existed, sure, but weren't super common. I never had a single game on cartridge and I was a heavy C64/C128 user for almost a decade. You're unlikely to find a lot of functional game cartridges for C64 on the used market. You can, however, find lots of disk images online, and with an SD card-based disk drive, you can load up your C64 with all the classics. It is a legal gray area, but many of the game makers have long since folded...so, I don't think it's all that ethically sketchy to play long-abandoned games on the real hardware. People do it with emulators all the time.  One really nice cartridge that is still available is MSSIAH, which is a MIDI interface and synth software in cartridge form. Highly recommended, if you're a musician and want to use the SID chip in your C64 as a nice little synth. It's the primary thing I do with my real C64, though I might play games on an emulator now and then."
c64,3cd4qf,SwellJoe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:17:09 2015 UTC,"That's bizarre to me.  I grew up with a C64, but we didn't have a disk drive, and had about 15-20 cartridge games.  I've been looking on eBay and they seem to go for 10-20 apiece (before shipping) so it definitely seems to me that getting a SD card disk drive is the best bet.  Looks like those go for around $60 on eBay... where would you recommend picking one up?"
c64,3cd4qf,Goldin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:02:12 2015 UTC,"Yes you can still get C64 cartridges. I have a collection of about 20 right now. This database says over 400 titles were available (last time I looked it was a smaller number, so who knows).  You can find them at thrift stores occasionally, but you have to know how to recognize them (they're not as wide as Atari cartridges, and have the connector flush with the case). Edit: I've also gotten some at retro gamer conventions.  eBay is the best for finding these, followed by shopgoodwill.com . Start cheap and small. Look up gameplay videos on YouTube before buying.  I also have one of the SD card floppy emulators but there's just something about being able to plug in a cartridge and go."

From there you and enable and disable things. We really should do a thing just on utility cartridges for the Commie. There are some really good ones out there. I mean, of course..If they are indeed still out there. Does anyone remember ISEPIC? Edit: I was trying to remember the most amazing utility cartridge I ever had for the C-64.

c64,3bd222,cream_of_slop,5,Sun Jun 28 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"Did it come with any cartridges, tapes/cassettes or disks?  If you have a cartridge, turn off the C64, plug it into the cartridge slot at the back, and turn on the machine. The cartridge should instantly boot.  If you have tapes and also have the datasette (the tape player), turn on the C64 and once you are greeted with the BASIC prompt, put the tape into the datasette, rewind it all the way, then either type LOAD and press enter or hold SHIFT and RUN/STOP together on the keyboard. Either way, you will be prompted to ""PRESS PLAY ON TAPE"". Press play on the datasette and the tape will begin loading.  If you have disks and a disk drive (eg. a 1541), turn on the C64 and once you are greeted with the BASIC prompt, put the disk into the disk drive and type one of the following:   LOAD""*"",8,1 - This will automatically load the first thing on the disk in drive 8 (which is generally what you'll have with just 1 disk drive). It depends on what's on the disk to figure out the usefulness of this command. If it's a single game, then this is the way to go. LOAD""$"",8 - This will load the directory listing of the disk in drive 8. Once loaded (it will be pretty quick), type LIST and press enter to see the disk's directory listing. From here you can type LOAD""ENTRY_ON_THE_DISK_TO_LOAD"",8,1 to load that entry.   As for your modern programming knowledge, in my opinion, it's pretty useless on the C64. If you want to program, the most popular choices are BASIC or Machine Code. BASIC is extremely simple to pick up. Machine Code is going to take some time and you'll find yourself reading manuals and learning a lot about the hardware. Machine Code is more rewarding but requires a lot of patience.  To get started in BASIC, turn on the computer and you're ready to go! For example, type the following:  10 PRINT ""HELLO"" 20 GOTO 10 RUN   Immediately you will see HELLO fill the screen.  You can also save any programs that you write in BASIC onto tape or disk. It's been decades since I've saved anything, but I believe the command is SAVE.  To save to tape (don't forget to rewind or fast forward to where you want to save on the tape - be careful not to overwrite something that you want!): SAVE ""PROGRAMNAME""  To save to disk:  SAVE ""PROGRAMNAME"",8,1  (If either of the SAVE commands are incorrect, someone please let me know. As I said, I'm a little rusty there :))  Hope that helps!"

The manual can be found on the web, I found this one by a simple google search: http://www.commodore.ca/manuals/c64_users_guide/c64-users_guide.htm  If you want to play games, then you should get yourself a disk drive as well. You can go for a 1541 II, and then go out to find floppies on markets and stores, or online. An easier thing to do (but more expensive) is to get a modern alternative, like the 1541 Ultimate 2 cartridge. With this device you can use all the C64 disk images that you can find on the web and have access to the complete C64 software catalogue.  There are alternatives to this device, but I highly recommend it.  Good luck!"

There's a lot to successfully emulating a C64 and/or 1541.  I would admit it's much cooler to emulate the 6502 yourself though.  I guess it depends on the goal of the project.

VICE is so large though that it's not the best candidate for emulation in this case. Frodo is probably the easiest.   But for this project, I'm thinking a bare bones 6502 emulation.  A new custom kernel (maybe CBM compatible), and a shell language. Basic immediately comes to mind, but I've been considering Python to kind of modernize it up a little."

It should overscan under the bezel, rounding off the outermost part of the borders. Compare to this photo of a Commodore 64 with a 170x monitor.  Modern PCs know every pixel will be on-screen, but machines that used essentially analog broadcast TV standards for their video (eg: NTSC and PAL) had to have a bunch of sacrificial pixels around the edges, as most analog TVs would chop off some amount of the perimeter. This was why the Commodore 8-bits had the colored borders. Even though the 170x's were ""monitors"", they were effectively analog TVs without tuners, and overscanned just like a TV.  That said, Halt and Catch Fire is a great show, and I'm glad to hear the Commodores make an appearance. (I haven't started watching the current season yet.)"

In the video I mention it being ranked as 74 but that was prior to when I locked the list down so it actually is a really old video. Pitstop II was published in 1984 by Epyx. It was develped by Steven H. Landrum, Dennis Caswell and Erin Murphy. It's a behind the car racer with quite a few tracks. While you can play one player the true fun comes though in the head to head mode. This game also simulates the pit stops as you drive around your fuel lowers and your tires become weakened from the strains of racing be it wear and tear from the road, accelerated ware from hitting the sides or from bumping into other drivers. All in all this was one of my favourite racers as a kid and you'd laugh at the ""realism"" in the game these days but at the time it seemed amazing!"

c64,33kjp8,stealthgunner385,3,Thu Apr 23 08:13:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, a 16 bit version of the 6502."
c64,33kjp8,gardners,2,Thu Apr 23 10:24:17 2015 UTC,"No, it was based on the 4502, which is a modified 65CE02, which is still really an 8-bit CPU with 16-bit address space (and some crazy banking to allow access to 1MB total).  It does have a couple of 16-bit operations, but they still use the 8-bit ALU, just as the 6502 had 16-bit JMP instructions."
c64,33kjp8,tamat,2,Fri Apr 24 23:04:00 2015 UTC,Nice to know. Wikipedia is wrong then. Who knew?
c64,33kjp8,tamat,2,Sat Apr 25 08:49:56 2015 UTC,does anybody knows if it emulates the c64 or is it a true reimplementation of the architecture?
c64,33kjp8,autowikibot,5,Thu Apr 23 09:37:53 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, it's all emulation using C64 and C65 ROM images on an FPGA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) There is no physical 6510 or SID or other 8 bit chip in the machine.  Check out the blog about the development of the C65GS for more development."

The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). (Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, as they were for ASICs, but this is increasingly rare.)  FPGAs contain an array of programmable logic blocks, and a hierarchy of reconfigurable interconnects that allow the blocks to be ""wired together"" – , like many logic gates that can be inter-wired in different configurations. Logic blocks can be configured to perform complex combinational functions, or merely simple logic gates like AND and XOR. In most FPGAs, logic blocks also include memory elements, which may be simple flip-flops or more complete blocks of memory.

c64,33kjp8,stealthgunner385,2,Thu Apr 23 10:19:36 2015 UTC,interesting.  so this is like the Atari 2600 flashback 2 with the VCS on a chip only for the commodore?
c64,33kjp8,psykotyk,2,Thu Apr 23 16:53:15 2015 UTC,Put me down as interested.  This reminds me of the Turbo Chameleon 64 which is an interesting FPGA implementation of a Commodore 64 inside a cartridge format.  It can be plugged into a C64 or function independently.  It does all sorts of crazy things.  www.syntiac.com/chameleon.html
c64,33kjp8,gardners,-2,Fri Apr 24 01:52:16 2015 UTC,"""You can build everything yourself""    Except for:     Chasis  Keyboard FPGA   I cannot find the chiplayout though. It directs me to a website where I need a passwort. Can someone post a picture of the board?"
c64,33kjp8,Hobbycoder,3,Thu Apr 23 07:38:22 2015 UTC,"To quote the master page:   Passwords for the download are sent to registered email addresses on each update.   Not quite sure I want to sign up yet.  Edit Found the possible caveat:   While it is possible for anyone to download the sources for the FPGA, we are offering a service to keep you updated with the latest core files and infos. We ask for a donation of at least EUR 5 to help us provide this service and contribute to ongoing development.   But at the same time they provide freely open GIT repository."
c64,33kjp8,SwellJoe,2,Thu Apr 23 08:20:25 2015 UTC,"From scanning over the VHDL in the GIT repository, I didn't see an implementation of a 6502.  Also lots of ""borrowed"" files from other people, which is why it's open I guess.  fpga arcade is a much more mature platform, though it's not overly open http://www.fpgaarcade.com/punbb/  The real question is, what are you going to run it on?"
c64,33kjp8,gardners,3,Thu Apr 23 12:07:22 2015 UTC,"The CPU is the GS4510 (gs4510.vhdl).  6502 backward compatibility for picky C64 software will be by having the 4510 emulate the 6502 (at 48MHz, it is fast enough to do this).  As for software, you will be able to run a lot of C64 software, and we will also provide development tools as we polish them a little, so that people can have fun programming the machine -- this really is one of the goals. In fact, we want to use it to teach ""machine intimate"" programming to first year University students."
c64,33kjp8,SwellJoe,2,Fri Apr 24 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"Probably code stuff yourself, as the only official software for the C65 is the Commodore internal demo's etc that came with the C65."
c64,33kjp8,gardners,-1,Thu Apr 23 12:55:33 2015 UTC,Spending 5€ before I even know if it is crap or not does not really convince me.
c64,33kjp8,gardners,4,Thu Apr 23 08:44:54 2015 UTC,"It's a measly five bucks. And, it seems like pretty much everything is out there in git. Looking at the prototypes, I'm inclined to drop a lot more than that to get ahold of the thing. The C65 was kind of an amazing beast, it'd be fun to play with one today. (Though I'd like to see more about the quality of the SID emulation before committing to it, as the only ""real"" thing I do with my C64 is make music, and I suspect that's what I'd get up to with a C65 emulator, as well.)"
c64,33kjp8,gardners,3,Thu Apr 23 09:27:18 2015 UTC,"We offer soft-SID emulation using the best open-source soft-SID implementation we could find.  However, we know that sound is one of the areas that people are most passionate about on the C64, so we are planning to have sockets for two SIDs to allow use of the real hardware.  On a related note, the supporting PCBs that will go around the off-the-shelf FPGA board to fit into a C64/C65 housing will all be using DIP hole-through components -- no surface mount.  This is to add to the retro feel, but also to make sure that people can build all the hardware at home -- aside from the off-the-shelf FPGA board -- of course."
c64,33k8es,uzimonkey,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:43:45 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the C-64 had a program for CP-M."

c64,33ennq,duhproject,3,Tue Apr 21 22:20:27 2015 UTC,I played the heck out of that game. I believe it (or Links its sequel) came with a copy protection dongle you had to have in the back of the 64.
c64,33ennq,mattlink13,2,Wed Apr 22 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"You're right. I recall a friend had the purchased copy and had the protection dongle. You could actually find this on cartridge, too. Not sure if that version had the dongle or not.  Great game -- brings back a lot of memories and it's still very playable today."

In this game you are heading into a maze like dungeon in the quest to defeat the wizard of wor. There are infinite stages in this game and you're just going for the highscore.

That said, on Usenet comp.sys.apple2 is very active—considerably more so than this subreddit and comp.sys.cbm put together—and I get the impression that, thanks to events like KansasFest and the VCFs' high Apple II orientation, plus the Apple II architecture's overall greater power and expandability, the overall level of retro activity—demos, new software and hardware, new books—is higher on the Apple II side. C64 is definitely #2 among 8-bitters, though, especially when the European community's participation is included."

Came out pretty good really I'm quite surprised, not a run anywhere and pretty much perfect coverage for the total cost of $10.95.  We did end up retrobriting the keys and this helped immensely but this thing sat in a box since last year after we did and they are just slightly un-grey because it seems to be true retrobriting is a temporary solution.    Here is the gallery showing the teardown originally, PS: the keyboard was YUCKY.    http://imgur.com/a/5Qaui  In about 5 mins we're going to power this up and make sure it still sings ;-O"

This let BASIC programs set up a tune that played asynchronously. Playback didn't have to be worked into game code, for example.

The joystick had two DE-9 connectors. The primary connector was Atari compatible, with a shorter grey cable and connector attached to this. The secondary connector is compatible with the non-standard Amstrad built ZX Spectrum computers; the Sinclair Interface II and other popular ZX Spectrum joystick interfaces were Atari compatible.

c64,2ukd8f,YouFeedTheFish,2,Tue Feb 3 14:11:34 2015 UTC,"I lucked out and had a HES-Mon cart for an assembler/disassembler. Hand editing my code in that was really painful though.  I lived in a small city, and there were only a few others around that knew ML (Machine Language, as we called it back in the day).. So my resources were mostly limited to reading game code to try and figure WTF they were doing. It got to the point where I could read code in hex format (no disassembly) for most op-codes."

It wouldn't hurt to open the case and remove and re-seat the VIC-II.  Just take precaution against electrostatic discharge, especially around the SID and PLA chips.  I'd mentioned it earlier today but Ray Carlsen has some excellent documents from his many years troubleshooting these machines."

c64,2u81ho,jhenry922,4,Fri Jan 30 18:41:13 2015 UTC,RF output goes to TV RF input. It's not composite. You need to get a C64 cable -> composite RCA cable if you want to plug it into the RCA plugs. You could try to test it yourself with some careful wiring. Google C64 video pinout.
c64,2u81ho,makerboost,2,Fri Jan 30 19:05:10 2015 UTC,"I'd try plugging the RCA plugs in differently. If you are using one of those cables usually meant for other purposes, but happens to fit the C64, then the wiring probably doesn't match the normal colour scheme. My experience is that the standard cables like that, that I've got from a general audio/hardware store, is that one will work on video but will only be in black and white (it links up with the luminence line, but is not wired to the C64s composite line) - good enough to see if it works though."

Not in a long shot. The UII is more flexible and has more features. For now.

Yet as I said it still needs work, not the device hardware, but the firmware and support.

My dad worked in a typewriter shop that started selling micro computers and he would regularly bring it home to learn how to use it, but I quickly took over. Before long I was programming simple games in BASIC and sending them off to magazines of the time (yes at 10 years old I honestly did that). The first computer I owned was the 1K Sinclair ZX80 and there was months of painful waiting with nothing but excuses from Sinclair Research who accepted mail orders when they still only had a working prototype, but I finally got it just in time for Christmas 1980. The ZX80 was so primitive even compared to the Commodore Pet at the time, but the £100 price tag (£80 in kit form) made it the first ever home computer that was officially classed as affordable by the average household. I loved both The Commodore Pet and the Sinclair ZX80 more back then than an expensive gaming PC today."

Be careful, and all will be fine.   The SID player lacks a feature to skip subtunes, but hey.   The documentation is... basically non-existant, but hey.   Other than that, it's the best invention ever since the first wheel rolled. I love everything about it - the REU emulation, the 1541 emulation (with a 3.5mm stereo jack to plug in your headphones so you have the familiar noises indicating everything is going fine), and all the stuff I don't think I'll ever really make proper use of.   Prepare for some waiting time when you order, Gideon seems to order and send them in batches of hundreds.

I do not have the tape adapter, so can't comment on that.  Overall solid design. He did a really good job on the case with the exception of needing a tool to spring the SD card out. Also it is a very expensive piece of kit, but being based on a pretty powerful FPGA has much potential for upgrades through firmware. Also, you can emulate a SID with it."

Here's some info:  As you can see from this video, I just added large .PRG file support, which transfers program files by uploading them in chunks to the C64 via the cartridge (it boots a custom cartridge image which copies chunks of data from the cartridge memory to the designated load address and out). Only program files and cartridge images are supported to this day, not D64/T64.  I'm already working on a 16K version (8K backward compatible by auto-switching the /GAME and /EXROM lines) and these are likely the cartridges the beta testers will receive. 16K chips are on the way, and a new batch of PCBs will be ordered soon!

This is a Qix clone/variant of which there were many on nearly every system. It's that game where you draw line to section off areas and something (in this case ""the stix"") is bouncing around the screen and you colour in the area that it's not in. The game gets faster and faster and the stix seems to home in on your line more and more as you progress though the game. If you get over 70% the next level is triggered. You get bonus points for getting as high past that threshold as possible and it's possible to get 99% if you play your cards right. All in all Stix is a good game and you can get an afternoon of good gameplay out of it. It's fun to play maybe check it out!"

c64,2qe07p,Adastra0,2,Fri Dec 26 17:29:30 2014 UTC,Also the Commodore 128!
c64,2qe07p,Goldin,1 point,Fri Dec 26 04:40:52 2014 UTC,that robot tho...  GEOS must have extended the life of the c64 another few years at least
c64,2qe07p,Thereminz,1 point,Thu Dec 25 23:49:11 2014 UTC,GEOS included? My dad obviously didn't buy our C64 from Toys 'R Us.
c64,2qbjt2,skurk,5,Wed Dec 24 23:23:43 2014 UTC,This is kickass!
c64,2qbjt2,loktar00,3,Thu Dec 25 01:32:41 2014 UTC,Good job! Looking forward to playing around with one of these :-)
c64,2qbjt2,ArmandoWall,3,Thu Dec 25 03:50:09 2014 UTC,"Very neat.  Silly question I am sure, but would all images on the cartridge need to load into $8000 (32768)? Was just wondering if it was feasible to get software onto it other than existing cartridge images. Like GEOS, for example."
c64,2qbjt2,Goldin,5,Thu Dec 25 20:35:18 2014 UTC,"For this version, yes. You can hack it to other locations with a little help of a soldering iron, but right now you're bolted to the memory space $8000-$9fff.  Whenever version 2.0 will hit the surface, the addressing will be configurable, as well as the ability to hold up to 16K images.  That being said, I've added support for PRG files larger than 8K in the current version. This was achieved by uploading it in 8K chunks to the C64's memory."
c64,2qbjt2,discolando,2,Thu Dec 25 20:59:36 2014 UTC,Awesome! I'd love to get my hands on one.
c64,2qbjt2,makerboost,2,Thu Dec 25 08:06:49 2014 UTC,"Awesome! Nice to see Hårek on the silkscreen also ;) You mentioned having problems with the USB HID descriptor, could you explain a bit? I'm starting my own development on a C64 cartridge, so any hints you might have would be very welcome!"
c64,2qbjt2,plexxer,3,Thu Dec 25 08:23:05 2014 UTC,"You mentioned having problems with the USB HID descriptor, could you explain a bit?   Not really much to explain after all. This was my first project featuring USB, and I guess the problems were due to my noobiness on the subject. V-USB, the virtual USB driver for AVR, was very simple to work with once I wrapped my head around its framework.  I should also mention that large HID data transfers appears to be achieved through exploiting the USB standard (see v-usb hid-data) so I've adopted this and I'm transferring the cartridge image through usbSetReport() packages. Since this is an agreement between the USB cartridge and the client application, it does not really matter for anyone else."
c64,2qbjt2,original_lunokhod,1 point,Thu Dec 25 11:08:11 2014 UTC,USB HID programming has a bit of a steep learning curve. Glad to see you got it working!
c64,2qbjt2,ooger,2,Thu Dec 25 15:54:57 2014 UTC,Fantastic!
c64,2qbjt2,rquesada,2,Thu Dec 25 10:33:06 2014 UTC,Do want
c64,2qbjt2,markseu,2,Thu Dec 25 15:04:28 2014 UTC,well done!
c64,2q2r1s,feenix17,1 point,Mon Dec 22 15:44:29 2014 UTC,"Holy crap, that brought up some memories."
c64,2q2r1s,Sam727,1 point,Tue Dec 23 03:11:42 2014 UTC,I loved this game as I could actually beat this one.  I had no idea what I was doing in the first.  Also the music from what I recall is different pitched than this one with missing instruments?  I had this for the NTSC C64 on diskette.
c64,2q0deo,midnightyeti,6,Sun Dec 21 22:34:18 2014 UTC,"I complete it annually, as a bit of a ritual. :) The only tricky bits are:    jumping on the boat on level 1; jumping and running along the roof on level 6; and the flipping of the candles on the final boss fight (but easy once you know the trick.)   You also kinda need to cheat a bit with the combat, by attacking while running backwards, leaving the room, then re-entering, resetting the enemy's position."
c64,2q0deo,seph200x,2,Mon Dec 22 03:12:47 2014 UTC,No. :(
c64,2q0deo,leonsecure,1 point,Sun Dec 21 23:00:40 2014 UTC,Aye. Lighting those flipping candles at the end was the hardest part.
c64,2q0deo,c64glen,1 point,Sun Dec 21 23:13:35 2014 UTC,Nice job!
c64,2q0deo,fuckyoua,1 point,Mon Dec 22 04:24:12 2014 UTC,"Don't remember if I completed it, but god did I love these games."
c64,2q0deo,Dijkie,1 point,Mon Dec 22 08:34:02 2014 UTC,"Yup, actually this is one of the few c64-games I did finish as a kid. Speaking of which, I should do it again now that I have a 1541 ultimate 2."
c64,2pxvfu,thegeekprophet,5,Sun Dec 21 02:49:23 2014 UTC,The first C64 Christmas demo I saw was on the SX-64 Test/Demo disk. You can grab the disk here and see the YouTube video of it here.
c64,2pxvfu,rolandjuno,2,Sun Dec 21 03:25:42 2014 UTC,Thanks!
c64,2pxvfu,rolandjuno,1 point,Sun Dec 21 03:32:22 2014 UTC,"Another one that comes to mind is Jingle Disk. D64 and YouTube links. Be sure to load it with LOAD""JINGLE"",8,1 instead of the usual LOAD""*"",8,1"
c64,2pxvfu,discolando,2,Sun Dec 21 03:51:06 2014 UTC,Does YouTube count or do you want them on disk?
c64,2pxvfu,discolando,1 point,Sun Dec 21 02:56:32 2014 UTC,"D64, t64 etc."

c64,2pxvfu,CiA_Kitty,1 point,Sun Dec 21 03:46:26 2014 UTC,My brother and I played that incessantly during the holidays years back. I think I have an original disk of this around in my trove of pirated software old drives and C64

c64,2ptmff,rolandjuno,2,Sun Dec 21 16:36:44 2014 UTC,I should have linked your store! Thanks for the great vinyl!
c64,2ptmff,feenix17,1 point,Mon Dec 22 06:22:02 2014 UTC,No worries. Glad you liked the stickers! I love seeing where folks choose to put them-- thanks for sharing!

c64,2pskqg,c64glen,3,Fri Dec 19 15:22:42 2014 UTC,"Would I be correct in assuming these are just concept renders ?  Unity is free, and I have over 15 years of experience with 3ds Max.  If there is a coder in the house, we could make Paradroid happen."
c64,2pskqg,tnucu,1 point,Fri Dec 19 17:53:48 2014 UTC,Coder with lots of Unity experience here. And a huge boner for Paradroid. PM me.
c64,2pskqg,chunkmcrunfast,1 point,Mon Dec 29 00:41:00 2014 UTC,Very cool.

c64,2pskqg,recycledheart,4,Fri Dec 19 22:05:25 2014 UTC,"You do know it doesn't work like that, right?"
c64,2pskqg,codepony,-1,Sat Dec 20 02:20:21 2014 UTC,Ever tried? These are static renderings of a 2d space into pseudo 3d block extrusions. It does work. So what if these were 'modeled'? Doesn't mean what I described wont get you there in 90% of the examples. I've done this countless times.
c64,2psc1p,true911,5,Fri Dec 19 13:48:05 2014 UTC,"c64sets.com   This site attempts to re-create some of the best Commodore 64 software sets. And by ""set"" we mean the box, manual, disks and any other materials contained inside the packaging."
c64,2psc1p,bunnybum,1 point,Fri Dec 19 23:26:05 2014 UTC,The library may not be extensive.  But I'm amazed by what they do have.  Incredible!
c64,2psc1p,jhenry922,1 point,Sat Dec 20 06:41:31 2014 UTC,I have a number of boxes for stuff they want.
c64,2pkqfx,CiA_Kitty,2,Wed Dec 17 13:48:54 2014 UTC,"Love it! Are you going to sell it on floppies? ;) It's amazing what you've manage to coax the machine to do, especially since it looks miles ahead of games that were released back in the day."
c64,2pkqfx,makerboost,1 point,Sat Dec 20 09:42:27 2014 UTC,"Wow, I ab-so-lute-ly adore the graphics, music and atmosphere. They kind of remind me of Spherical, and maybe Cauldron. Can't have enough games about wizards IMO, I can't wait to play this! :D What tools are you using to develop, draw and compose this?"
c64,2pkjg8,CiA_Kitty,1 point,Wed Dec 17 12:09:36 2014 UTC,It's amazing how much Jeroen Tel got out of one channel for the Hawkeye in-game tunes.
