AskPhysics,3e6gef,raddaya,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:13:18 2015 UTC,"Imagine a river which splits up into 2 branches. A really wide branch and a narrower branch. Most of the water will flow down the wide branch but some will still flow down the narrow branch.   This is analogous to having current flowing through a circuit with two resistors of different resistance.   With this analogy we can also see the fact that the total resistance should be less than each individual resistance.  Now imagine building a dam across one of the branches of the river. All of the water would flow down the other branch which isn't blocked. This is like having an infinite resistance resistor and another resistor with finite resistance in parallel.  A ideal voltmeter would draw no current from the circuit but in practice this never happens. So a good voltmeter would be like a dam with a tiny hole in it, such that it would only draw a tiny amount of the water/electrical current."

AskPhysics,3e6gef,StuTheSheep,1 point,Wed Jul 22 11:36:31 2015 UTC,"I thought that current is supposed to take the path of least resistance   This is not really correct. A better way to think of it is that current takes all possible paths from high potential to low potential, and that the amount of current that goes down each path is inversely proportional to the resistance. So if path A has twice as much resistance as path B, then path B will have twice as much current as path A. If a path has no resistance, it will have just about all of the current; if a path has infinite resistance, it will have none of the current."
AskPhysics,3e6eq0,CruzSchiffer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:47:25 2015 UTC,"You're looking at this from completely the wrong angle. Period of orbit of the earth or the gravitational pull of the sun isn't even required. Doubtless there's some convoluted way to solve it like that, but it's not really required.  I assume you know the Shell theorem. So, we can consider the masses of the Earth/neutron star to be concentrated at the center.  The only other information required for this question is the radius of the Earth. It is 6371 km(or rather, that's the average value as the Earth is not exactly a sphere but we may approximate it as being so.) I would not at all expect to need to memorize this for an exam. I don't think you would normally need to know anything other than the value of G, if even that.  Anyway, to solve the problem, consider your mass as ""m"" and the mass of the Earth = mass of the neutron star = ""M_e"" [Not really required actually, but just to show you.].  On Earth, F1 = G*m*M_e/(6371)2 = 675 N.  On the neutron star, F2 = G*m*M_e/(10)2. Note that the diameter is given, and not the radius.  It is fairly simple to solve these two equations for F2."

If you add up the mass of all the electrons and quarks in all of your atoms you get basically nothing. Protons and neutrons make up most of your mass but their mass is much larger than the mass of the individual quarks in them.  Secondly there is no reason you couldn't have a universe with bosons making up mater, it just happens than the stable particles in the standard model which have non zero mass happen to be fermions. The Z and W are also massive, but bosons, they are just not stable. Instead quarks and electrons are stable so that is what ""make up matter.""  A fundamental particles mass simply comes from its coupling to the higgs field. Some particles, like the gluons can't couple to the higgs field due to symmetry arguments (glue is a singlet under SU(2) and hypercharge) but for any of the others you could easily have the coupling just happen to be zero. Or better yet, introduce more fermionic fields which don't couple to the higgs field, they could be Dirac spinors and still not have mass.  There is no deep reason that Fermions = Matter or have mass. It just happens that the two things that make up matter in our universe, happen to be fermions."

The time scale of the change in speed is however very different. If you hit a hard surface, the change occurs very fast, hence a lot of g-force and shattered bones.

However, that's not what you're seeing, since you'd have to go extremely hot to get a Si gap of .8eV.  A quick Google came up with this paper, according to which the dark current in a CCD goes from depletion-based (ie, due to generation in the depletion region according to SRH rules), with activation energy Eg/2, to diffusion (of minority carriers across the base)-based, with activation energy Eg. Depending on where you're measuring, I wouldn't be surprised if you came up with numbers right in the middle of those two values. Make sense?"
AskPhysics,3e2krb,clade_nade,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yes that was the paper I was reading, however I was confused by some of the language it contained. So as temperature increases in the CCD the ""mode"" of electron generation goes from being in the depletion region to being ""diffusion-based""? And you're saying that in the depletion based mode this energy is half the bandgap, (.55eV say) and that as it moves to diffusion based (would eventually reach 1.1eV) this 0.55eV is stretched to a larger value (meaning 0.795eV is fine because it is between 0.55eV-1.1eV?). I will need to look up what ""minority carries"", SRH rules and read more about the ""depletion-region"" I think. Thanks for the help!! Edit: SRH being Shockley-Read-Hall? That makes sense I suppose, because the CCD definitely has a low ""charge-carrier density"" and it would make sense that thermal energy would give way to ""lattice vibration""."
AskPhysics,3e2krb,clade_nade,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:36 2015 UTC,"To summarize the paper: basically there's two kinds of current that could happen. Let's say your Si is n-type.  1) A semiconductor has an intrinsic carrier density ni. If, at any place in the silicon, the product of electron density and hole density, np, is < ni2, extra electrons and holes will spontaneously form. In the depletion region (you'll have to read up on that yourself) this is indeed the case, and there's a current. Since the generation is proportional to ni which is proportional to exp(-Eg/2kT), the Arrhenius energy is Eg/2.  2) There is also current due to the diffusion of holes from the depletion region to the back of the device. This is proportional to ni2 or exp(-Eg/kT), giving an Arrhenius energy of Eg.  Current 1 matters more at lower temps and 2 at higher temps. In between, you'll have activation energies in between. This could very well give rise to your .7-.8eV numbers."

AskPhysics,3e2qa7,rstanton3,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:17 2015 UTC,"Around 400,000 years after the big bang, the universe cooled enough for free charges to combine into neutral atoms and thereby transitioned from opaque to transparent. At that time, light was essentially emitted from every point in the universe simultaneously and has been streaming ever since.  So light that started out close to us got here fast. Light that started out a bit further away took a bit longer. In any case, this background radiation is always light that was emitted at that time, so the CMB is always providing an image of ""the universe as it was at the very, very beginning"" (or, at least, when it was only a few hundred-thousand years old); the difference over time is just that it's had farther to travel. This is, essentially, what defines the ""observable universe"": it's all of the stuff that was close enough at that time for its light to have reached us by now. Note that a lot of that stuff is, and always has been, receding from us at speeds above the speed of light. However, as the Hubble parameter decreased over time, that light eventually ended up in a region where the expansion rate was below the speed of light and has been coming toward us ever since.  In any case, as more time passes, light from ever farther away will continue to reach us, so the background will always ""be there"". However, as you say, the universe is expanding. As a result, light that was emitted from sufficiently far away is red-shifted relative to us (the wavelength has increased). This may, in time, result in it become undetectable as the wavelength becomes too large. But until such a time, there will always be more of it coming."

And I wasn't talking about it becoming more and more redshifted to the point of undetectability, I am saying that there will come a time when there will literally be no more cmbr, as a result of the expanding universe. Is there anything you can think of that would make that not true, because I can't think of anything. The way I am thinking is this, the farthest away that the CMBR could be at the moment is right at the edge of our observable universe(not really though since some time has passed since the universe began to expand FTL at some point), therefore once the light that is currently at the edge of the observable universe reaches us, no more could ever come. I think we would lose the ability to detect it even sooner."
AskPhysics,3e2qa7,RCHO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"Is there anything you can think of that would make that not true   Yes; the things I said in the above comment.   The way I am thinking is this, the farthest away that the CMBR could be at the moment is right at the edge of our observable universe   This is incorrect. There are two possibilities, depending on your meaning:   The farthest away the CMB could be right now is right here, if you mean the light we're detecting. The farthest away the CMB could be right now is infinitely far away, if you mean the light that was emitted.   The background radiation fills the universe, streaming outward from every point.   therefore once the light that is currently at the edge of the observable universe reaches us, no more could ever come.   Light that is currently at the edge of the observable universe (around 46 billion light-years away) won't make it. In fact, any light currently farther away than about 17 billion light-years will be unable to reach us, due to the expansion. However, light that's closer than that will continue to reach us forever. Light that's currently just inside that range will take much longer than 17 billion years to reach us, because the intervening space will expand in the meantime. Light that's a bit closer to the boundary will take even longer, and light that's closer than that will take even longer, with the time of arrival tending toward infinity as you approach the boundary.  Meanwhile, we can see things that are much farther away than that because we're now getting light they emitted a long time ago. And we'll continue to see them, as more and more light from them reaches us. We'll never get the light they're emitting ""right now"", but we'll continue to get light from them forever, continuously red-shifted to give us a slower and slower version of their evolution."

The singularity itself is not a point, but a spacelike 3-hypersurface, which is the technical term of what we would recognize as ""an instant of time"". A person falling into the black hole has this instant of time, the singularity, in his future. It is not a point in space you can look towards or something like that. This is why it's wrong to say that a black hole is a point mass of infinite density or similar.  The Big Bang does not look at all like a white hole.

Instead, they're full general relativistic objects, and you cannot use Newtonian mechanics and geometry.  The description of a black hole in detail starts from the Schwarzschild metric, so start by reading up on that. The Schwarzschild chart however is not particularly handy for reading the topological structure, so let's take a Penrose diagram (which is just the black hole in other coordinates):  diagram  We have omitted the two angular directions [;\theta;] and [;\phi;], as a Schwarzschild black hole is spherically symmetric. Forward/backwards in time is upwards/downwards, and outwards/inwards is right/left (but nothing is to scale).  The black hole + the rest of the Universe form the diamond + triangle shaped region.  See how the singularity is a horizontal boundary? It's an instant of time (it's a t=const surface for some accurately defined t coordinate). The blue observer has made the error of overcoming the horizon. Since he cannot move faster than light (which goes at 45°) you can see geometrically that he has to hit the singularity."

The r = \infty lines pass through points whose spatial coordinates are 0 (at t=0, this corresponds to the big bang, I assume)?    This is a conformal diagram and so the coordinates are the conformal time and space. They are specially rescaled for the whole Universe to fit in a finite diamond. The r=infinity (where r is the normal schwarzschild distance) are conformal boundaries; they are actually an infinite time and space away from the center of the diamond. They are the future and past null infinities, and are the boundaries where infalling/outgoing light rays can be thought to originate/end, an infinite time into the past/future.  This Universe has no big bang. It's eternal and has an eternal black hole. Google 'big bang conformal' if you want to see a conformal diagram for the BB.   What is the antihorizon?

AskPhysics,3e1u2b,MLBfreek35,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:19:20 2015 UTC,"The point is that spacetime is really curved, so the event horizon is moving outwards at the speed of light but it's not getting any bigger in terms of surface area because of the way spacetime is curved.  Black holes are usually unconsciously presented in Schwarzschild coordinates. In this coordinates, the horizon is ""stationary"" (meaning that the coordinate velocity [; \frac{d r_\text{Schwarzschild}}{dt_\text{Schwarzschild}} = 0;]). Also, a photon moving outwards at the EH is not actually moving (again in terms of coordinate velocity). It stays at the horizon. Pictorially people say that the photon is moving outwards at c but space itself is falling inwards at c, but this is kind of a difficult analogy to work with.  The right way to tackle this is to recognize that coordinates are completely arbitrary, and coordinate speeds are meaningless. The only way to measure the speed of the photon is to meet with it with a ruler and clock. Sure enough, if you fall through the horizon you'll measure the aforementioned photon moving outwards at the speed of light. Since the photon remained on the horizon, you'll also measure the horizon moving outwards at the speed of light past you. This is a ""true"" velocity."

However I don't think that anyone would actually go through with this risking suicide thing (Ok, well some would, much as russian roulette is even a thing) since who'd want to essentially ""create"" universes where any potential you had to impact it was gone, and all you're leaving is grief for family and friends, even though you're not there to experience it.

AskPhysics,3dyrh5,Nonmomentus,2,Mon Jul 20 17:01:50 2015 UTC,"It will reach an equilibrium, which is to say some steady state which it oscillates about. The exact description of the equilibrium state will depend on your description of the system. In this case, your liquid in enclosed in some semi-permeable membrane that lets liquid molecules out, but doesn't let gas molecules in. It's not really clear what happens to the energy of a gas molecule that hits the sphere, so it's hard to say what the temperature relationship is between the liquid and the gas.  I think this is a little too focused on thermodynamics concepts like phases. As you heat the liquid toward boiling it expands and the forces holding it together diminish. At some point surface tension is no longer operating, but the way you've set the problem up, there's no dramatic difference between a liquid and a gas because you're using magic to maintain the surface integrity of the sphere, so even as the thing boils you just have a larger and large sphere."
AskPhysics,3dyrh5,leplen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your explanation!  If it was a bit simpler and just a ball of liquid floating in a gas (so, ignoring things like gravity) and it's large enough to remain until the temperature is reasonably close to the temperature at equilibrium, how would that temperature look when compared to the ambient temperature? Would it be the same, or slightly lower because of evaporation (but counteracted by heat transfer from the gas around it), or would it just keep getting colder and colder until it freezes, if it is large enough?"
AskPhysics,3dyrh5,zebediah49,2,Mon Jul 20 21:59:47 2015 UTC,"Amusingly, the system will cool.  A lot.  As a beginning note, it doesn't actually matter if the sphere is solid or liquid, or what temperature (below boiling point) the system begins at -- your rules only care about a sphere (liquid or solid) -> gas transition, so it can be either a liquid or solid without issue.  Starting off, you have liquid evaporating and diffusing away from center, carrying energy with it.  That energy is not replaced.  The particles that spawn to replace those that evaporate off are at the new, lower temperature of the sphere -- and they will continue evaporating and diffusing away.  What's the limit of this? I'm going to assume a finite atmosphere for a moment, because it's easier to handle for this: we actually get an equilibrium.  You end up with the system being colder, uniformly at a temperature such that the vapor pressure of the sphere material at that temperature is equal to the partial pressure of the portion of it in the atmosphere.  The exact point of this depends on geometry, material properties, and initial conditions.  What happens when you get your infinite system?  Well, for one you never reach a static equilibrium.  The infinite boundary means that you can never change it.  Never the less, we can say some things about the sort-of equilibrium we reach.  Specifically, at every point, the energy flow inwards due to thermal diffusion will equal the energy required to vaporize the mass of vaporized sphere material flowing outwards.  The result is a gradient of sphere-material from center to outside, (high to zero) and a temperature gradient from outside to center (T0 to some lower T).  This gradient will expand indefinitely as a function of time.  I'm reasonably sure that the sphere temperature will approach zero as this progresses.  You could, if you wanted, write out the set of coupled differential equations for this."
AskPhysics,3dyrh5,rstanton3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:25 2015 UTC,Thank you for your analysis! It does make sense. I've read about gas giants having no clear boundary between the liquid and gaseous areas of their atmosphere/surface – would this situation be similar?

AskPhysics,3dz40f,leuno,11,Mon Jul 20 18:28:46 2015 UTC,"If two particles can be essentially the same particle in two different places through quantum entanglement, do they share mass?    Two entangled particles are not essentially the same particle. There's absolutely no reason to think they ""share mass"". You can have a massless particle (eg. photon) entangled with a particle that has mass (eg. electron).    And if two particles can share all their properties, why not a billion?   Again, they don't really share properties. At best they have properties that depend on each other. There is no limit in quantum mechanics to how many particles can be entangled. Just having two particles entangled is a very simplified example.    So could it be that's what the universe is doing (or did), and if so shouldn't that alter what we think of relativity?   This is an incorrect understanding of entanglement. No, it doesn't make any sense. (Not trying to be harsh, just straight forward).    I tried finding the answer on my own, and read something about entangled particles sharing mass in the other direction   I vaguely remember an article like that. I don't really recall exactly what they meant. Sometimes physicist use language that is going to be completely nonsense to lay people and possibility even people outside their narrow area of physics. You'll need to take ten steps back and grasp the basic concepts before going into exortic issues like that."
AskPhysics,3dz40f,The_Serious_Account,3,Mon Jul 20 19:12:23 2015 UTC,"I am not going to claim to understand entanglement, but the idea just doesnt make much sense physically. If we cant test the idea it doesnt really hold much merit. All of our ideas need to be testable in some way (eventually...technology may need to catch up first).   Looking at your idea we should see something with like particles right? Well we can look at a crystal with an electron microscope and see each individual atom. The atoms in the bulk crystal should be similar enough that nature would want to compress them by your idea, but it doesnt happen.   Also you claim that energy and mass would have some different relationship than what relativity claims, but it has been tested alot and relativity, (both special and general) hold up for the non-quantum world."
AskPhysics,3dz40f,geo44241,-3,Mon Jul 20 19:02:26 2015 UTC,"Yes of course it needs to be testable. Are you saying my idea is unsound because there's no current machine to test it? That is how every idea starts. If it were already measurable it wouldn't be an idea.  How do we know when we look at the atoms in a crystal some of them aren't entangled? There's a huge amount of stuff in that small sample, every single one would have to be tested to see if any of them were the same.   Maybe it's rare that the atoms in one crystal are entangled with each other, but they could be with other crystals half a universe away. And the compression itself wouldn't be observable, and it wouldn't be something ongoing, I couldn't figure out a better way to word that, but it's more like it was part of the program from the beginning, not something that happens moment to moment. Well maybe, and maybe not.  And yes I know relativity works as it is, but there's a missing link between the two worlds, so just because the math works the way it is now doesn't mean there isn't a different version of the math that would also work that incorporates the quantum world. The more we learn the more questions we have to ask, so just because the equation works doesn't mean there isn't more to it."
AskPhysics,3dz40f,magus42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"I don't quite understand what you're saying - do you mean that the earth's mass is actually a tiny fraction of what we think it is? Why haven't we observed that? Or do you mean that the earth's mass appears to be 6e24kg but it's actually much less and being multiplied by entanglement? Either way, there is no evidence to support either of these claims.  Also, entanglement can't work as ""compression"" - in general it takes more information to describe an entangled system because it has to be fully specified, whereas an unentangled system can be decomposed into a tensor product of the individual components making up the system.

You get erosion caused by the high velocity (~10s km/s) ions colliding with the ceramic surface of the ionization channel. So far there are two solutions that seems viable. The first one developed by a team at JPL is to modify the magnetic field to limit the flux of ions intersecting the walls. It's a pretty cool technique they kind of found by accident and we will try to replicate it. The other solution developed in my lab is to get rid of the walls altogether and confine the plasma with a carefully designed magnetic field.

Basically, I used an FTIR to scan samples that had a paraffin wax coating on it, I then proceeded to remove the wax by use of computational methods. I was able to extract the paraffin spectrum on the tissue sample and have a pure tissue sample remaining, in theory. So, I was quite familiar in matlab. I was trained in matlab in my college (Dublin Institute of Tech / DIT).

It's just that physics becomes this almost poetic study of the universe, the way the math and theory and experiments come together, and it takes a few (confused) years to really understand that, but it's absolutely amazing when you do.  The whole wave-particle duality thing is often sort of romanticized by people who don't fully understand it, but really, if you've studied Calc I-III and Differential Equations, Electromagnetism (the full course, not just intro physics), Modern Physics, and Introductory Quantum Mechanics (again, the full course), and an advanced laboratory course, you can fully undersstand this.  But these are things covered in the first 2-3 years of an undergraduate physics degree.  Another thing to consider is that many PhDs have a lot to do with experiments and fabrication and is often highly interdisciplinary, especially in materials science (solar cells, LEDs, batteries/energy storage, lasers, semiconductors, transistors, etc.).  PhDs and research in general tend to be theoretical (lots of equations, modelling, numerical analysis (basically doing calculus with a computer), etc.), or experimental, which is applying the theory and making things.  One really hot area of physics right now is ""condensed matter,"" aka studying solids.
