futurama,3e0qxd,dsmx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"Netflix used to number the episodes according to the correct studio production order, but at some point around a year or two ago (probably due to a change in the licensing deal, I'm assuming) they changed the order to the incorrect airing date order, which besides being jumbled around, is broken up into several more seasons than the studio numbering indicates.  From the Wikipedia article on the episode list:   Fox Broadcasting Company broadcast many episodes of the original four production seasons of Futurama out of order, resulting in five broadcast seasons. Comedy Central also chose to air the parts of season 6 and 7 out of order as well. This list follows the season box sets, which feature the episodes in the original, intended production season order, ignoring order of broadcast.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Futurama_episodes"

It's also one of the best shows I've seen regarding keeping up with it's own in-universe continuity.   Regular Show might also be up your alley. It's not quite as mature as Futurama, but not near as kid-friendly as most other shows on Cartoon Network. Lots of nerd humor.  Maybe try Gravity Falls too?

If you were translating an English novel where a character says ""good day"", you probably wouldn't use just ""bonjour"" in the French version, because that would be translating a formal expression into an everyday expression, hence changing the register."
futurama,3dn2t4,Cayou,-4,Fri Jul 17 22:23:30 2015 UTC,"Bon means good, and jour means day, so it kind of implies it."
futurama,3dn2t4,Jesburger,18,Sat Jul 18 00:07:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you don't translate words by taking them apart and using the translations of their components. That's not how it works. The standard neutral (non-fancy, non-slang, etc.) French greeting is ""bonjour"", and that should be translated into English using the standard neutral English greeting... which is ""hello"" (unless there's a really compelling reason to do otherwise, which there isn't here). And vice-versa."
futurama,3dn2t4,Cayou,-3,Sat Jul 18 00:15:52 2015 UTC,"You would translate it to hello, but it would be false to say that bonjour doesn't mean good day."

Yes, ""bonjour"" means ""good day"" in the same way that ""goodbye"" means ""may god be with you"". I just don't believe this is relevant in this context, since OP's post and this comment thread are specifically about translation."

futurama,3dm1mt,DAMN_it_Gary,2,Fri Jul 17 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"It's actually very simple, just use the round brush tool and change its size to achieve the look you want.

What else.. This specific project was the first time for me where i decided to work on just one layer. I have to be honest, it's harder and more time consuming, but makes you concentrate more on the details and improve the technique (not that you need much for this kind of stuff). Also.. The eraser tool it's your best friend, use it! :D  PS: Opacity always 100% for both brush and eraser tool."

futurama,3disgp,TheClevelandUnicorn,3,Thu Jul 16 16:41:35 2015 UTC,"Not really in Swedish.  ""Anus"" translates to ""anus"". It's pronounced differently than in English, of course, but ""anus"" and ""Uranus"" still match.  The ""Ur"" part, making the ""your"" in English... nope, that doesn't translate. The closest alternative is the Swedish word ""ur"", meaning ""watch"" or ""clock"" -- but with the alternative meaning of ""origin"" or, colloquially, ""very"".  Swedish also joins words together, so ""car door"" becomes ""bildörr"" (phonetically, ""beel-durr"").  Which means that... ""Uranus"" can be literally (and validly) translated to ""the origin of all anuses"", or just ""anus of a clock"". And yeah, the name of the planet is ""Uranus"" in Swedish, too. Uhm. But I've never really heard that as a joke. Not sure why, because it's brilliant.  Want to learn more Swedish? Check out the video Beginners' Swedish."
