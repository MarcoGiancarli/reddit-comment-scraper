GirlsPlayingSports,34mm23,ClipKlop,-1,Sun May 3 12:36:18 2015 UTC,"Last time I checked, Longboards are a type of skateboard."
GirlsPlayingSports,34mm23,shabazzseoulja,-1,Sun May 3 18:35:38 2015 UTC,you are most certainly wrong.
GirlsPlayingSports,34mm23,shabazzseoulja,1 point,Fri May 8 15:33:03 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia would say otherwise  ""A longboard is a longer variant of a skateboard"""
GirlsPlayingSports,34mm23,shabazzseoulja,0,Fri May 8 15:47:21 2015 UTC,"Well wikipedia is wrong in this case.  Longboards are longboards, not skateboards, 100% plain and simple."
GirlsPlayingSports,34mm23,shabazzseoulja,4,Fri May 8 15:49:59 2015 UTC,Is urbandictionary.com wrong?  Is Dictionary.com wrong?  Is medical-dictionary.com wrong?  Might it just be that you're wrong?  Especially since it is a board with wheels on it so that you can skate upon it?  I'm going to go with you being wrong because it is a type of skateboard.  100% plain and simple.
GirlsPlayingSports,34mm23,TheWestMichiganMan,0,Fri May 8 16:06:59 2015 UTC,"Look, I don't care what the internet or some old white dudes say about this bud.  I have several skateboards, and a few longboards.  Skateboards are for skateboarding, longboards are for longboarding.  That's it, that's all."
GirlsPlayingSports,34mm23,TheWestMichiganMan,2,Fri May 8 16:15:55 2015 UTC,You are extremely dense.  Why am I not surprised this is coming from an avid skateboarder?  Are longboard surfboards not a type of surfboard either?
GirlsPlayingSports,34mm23,tallxleo,0,Fri May 8 17:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much 2/3 water, which is kind of the nominal standard of density.  Longboards certainly aren't shortboards, but since they are used to surf, they are surfboards.  However, that holds no bearing to skateboarding and longboarding, as they are used for two completely different things in completely different places.  Cruise on down to your local skatepark on a longboard and tell everyone you got a new skateboard and tell me what the response is from people who define the terms in modern culture.  Or send me another weak link to some website defining a term you know nothing about."
GirlsPlayingSports,34mm23,ZeroLithium,0,Fri May 8 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're also cheeky.  Nice.  Your stupidity is baffling.  At this point, I would be better off arguing with a wall.  A board attached to wheels for the purpose of skating (such as a longboard) is a skateboard, whether it is meant for one type of skating or another, it is a type of skateboard.  I'm done arguing with you.  Your skull is apparently too thick to grasp even the simplest of notions.  It's probably thickened from all the times you clearly have hit your head while skating on your longboard."

GirlsPlayingSports,32759i,almostagolfer,7,Sat Apr 11 04:50:21 2015 UTC,How do you think it will happen?
GirlsPlayingSports,32759i,almostagolfer,-3,Sat Apr 11 04:51:00 2015 UTC,"A progression of more difficult climbs looking for greater thrills until one day, she tries a climb that she can't handle. Of course, I'm basing this on the free-climb that she is doing in the pic. Adequate safety gear will prevent an accident.  On the other hand, I have never seen an old climber."
GirlsPlayingSports,32759i,junpei098,8,Sat Apr 11 05:51:26 2015 UTC,You don't see many climbers in your life do you?
GirlsPlayingSports,32759i,almostagolfer,2,Sat Apr 11 09:03:51 2015 UTC,"Just the young, handsome or pretty ones that they put in the videos and TV shows."
GirlsPlayingSports,32759i,TenzingNarwhal,10,Sun Apr 12 00:36:17 2015 UTC,"I mean this in the least mean-spirited way possible....  If you go to /r/Climbing, she isn't considered a climber.  She is a model who climbs for photo shoots, and advertises herself for product exposure while ""climbing"" which she does at levels achieved within a year of climbing by most people.  That being said, while she has made it to competition for climbing, she has never gotten very far, and only does it for the credit and ""resume padding"". She is not a good rock climber by any rate.  Also, she is bouldering in this pic, not "" free-climbing"" as you put it. She is less that a few feet off the ground and is in no danger.  Now, a distiction- there's ""free climbing"", and "" free soloing"".  Free climbing is climbing under your own power, using your own hands and feet to propel you up the wall, as opposed to aid climbing, which would use etriers (rope ladders), daisy chains, and other equipment to help you navigate areas you cannot do without. In BOTH circumstances, you'd have plenty of protective equipment, namely ropes to catch your fall.  Free soloing is that, but without the ropes for protection. Alex Honnold is a famous current free-soloer.  Finally, ""I haven't met any old rock climbers"" is a horrible argument. Its purely anecdotal, and has no basis in reality. The ""old rock climbers"" of yesteryear are the industry giants of today.  Lynn Hill, and Dean Potter are STILL climbing, and still doing great things on their own. The owners of Royal Robbins (Royal Robbins, himself), The North Face (Douglas Tompkins), and Patagonia (Yvon Chouinard) are alive and well, championing stewardship and exploration. These four alone were huge names back in the golden years of Yosemite, and are definitely ""old rock climbers.""  John Gill, the father of modern bouldering went on to become a professor of mathematics and is still alive as well.  Warren Harding, the first man to climb The Nose on El Capitan died peacefully in his home at the age of 77.  Chuck Pratt died of a heart attack at 61.  Tom Frost makes rock climbing equipment with his own company now.  And to think that all of these are just a few of the many that not only are still alive, but did crazy enough things over 50 years ago to become famous. Think of all the ones that followed in their footsteps but went unrecognized, and are still alive too.  Back to statistics, rock climbing injuries are so rare, that the most common one is an overused finger pully injury.   The chances of dying while rock climbing are 0.032%, AND the ones that are most likely to die actually die while rappelling and NOT climbing.  Hell, even in my local rock gym, there's 6 different couples that all climb and are all over 60.  Just because you have anectodal evidence that confirms your bias doesn't mean its true. There's plenty of others out there who have their own evidence to counter your argument, and there's plenty more statistical evidence that paints the real picture."
GirlsPlayingSports,32759i,almostagolfer,2,Sat Apr 11 12:55:48 2015 UTC,"Well, said. I have been properly chastised.   I'm glad she isn't on the way to killing herself.  My comment about old rock climbers is similar to one I make about my weight. ""I can't wait until I'm old. I have never seen an old fat person. At last I will be thin."" I deliver it deadpan, but I know why it is wrong."

Female athletes today are aware of the Internet and the proliferation of high quality digital cameras. Someone taking a close up of your crotch was less likely to get enough detail for her to be concerned, and even if they did, the only way for anyone besides the photographer and his/her team to see such a thing would be in print and probably lots of publishers would not print something like that. Today a woman would know that it is perfectly simple for almost anyone to get a decent shot of your cameltoe, and then have that image disseminated to millions within hours.
