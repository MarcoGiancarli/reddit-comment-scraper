StLouisRams,3e40bi,SoulardSTL,10,Tue Jul 21 19:57:56 2015 UTC,Expected.  No reason to rush him back and jeopardize his future.  Tre Mason was good last year and can be good again until he is healthy enough to play.
StLouisRams,3e40bi,D33GS,5,Tue Jul 21 20:48:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Mason's one helluva quality RB who's fully capable of carrying for us. Between Gurley and Mason, we'll have one of the most powerful platoons in the entire League. Plus, I want to see our green O-Line get some game time in before Gurley gets back in play, have them all be comfortable before in pro games before having them open lanes for our team's potential future franchise player. Glad to know he can be brought in at a moment's notice once he's healthy and Fisher wants to get him some game time."
StLouisRams,3e40bi,New_DudeToo,2,Tue Jul 21 21:15:26 2015 UTC,Yes. Definitely don't want to throw Gurley behind that O Line until he is 110% healthy. I imagine we will have one of the youngest o lines in the league. I'm so ready for football to start.

StLouisRams,3dzg7k,Kaos047,2,Mon Jul 20 20:51:07 2015 UTC,If Tavon sucks it up at WR this year I sure hope we put him back to return kicks more often. He has extreme talent with the ball in his hands... all those punt returns being called back still haunt me.

StLouisRams,3dqw75,JaquiskiTaterTartt,9,Sat Jul 18 16:15:44 2015 UTC,I think Jenkins gets too much shit from our fan base but I'd have certainly put Ogletree or McDonald in that spot instead. Same goes with Mason. Kids great and he'll be great but we have better players on the roster.
StLouisRams,3dqw75,axle69,6,Sat Jul 18 16:55:14 2015 UTC,"Ogeltree man.  I've said for a long time he is a stud, but he really goes under the radar. I'm honestly thinking of buying his jersey.  He is overshadowed by guys like Donald and Quinn, but he is an integral part of our defense. His ability to create turnovers and stuff runs is incredible. A little work on pass defense (which honestly he is still really good at) would make him incredible.   For some reason our linebacker corp is often overlooked. Laurinaitis is a Ram through and through. Ogeltree embodies our defensive scheme. Sure, the line is something to be incredibly proud of (rightfully so) but the linebackers are an integral part of the defensive unit."
StLouisRams,3dqw75,BilllyMayes,2,Sun Jul 19 02:51:11 2015 UTC,"I like McDonald. He definitely played great last year, but he was bad as a rookie. He'll have to maintain his high level of play through 2015 to prove it wasn't a fluke. I've noticed a lot of Rams fans praising Ogletree, but he still has to step up IMO. Over two full seasons of play, he has been average at best.  I like Jenkins playmaking ability and I believe he will step up big time in 2015. Meanwhile Mason was great last year and should do great until Gurley gets healthy.  It was difficult with the honorable mentions cuz outside the defensive line, none of them have truly separated themselves from the pack. Jenkins was my projection pick while Mason and Laurinaitis were safe ones."
StLouisRams,3dqw75,axle69,3,Sat Jul 18 17:05:38 2015 UTC,I don't think you're wrong for your opinions. I think saying McDonald was bad his rookie year is a little disingenuous as he wasn't that bad on top of being a rookie and pretty banged up but he played at a pro bowl caliber last year. Ogletree falls into the same realm as Jenkins to me as being an inconsistent guy but his play making ability is just as good as Jenkins and when he makes a mistake it usually doesn't end in an opposing TD like Jenkins. Laurainitis is definitely deserving of that last spot without a doubt.
StLouisRams,3dqw75,axle69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"I'll agree on the McDonald part. Maybe I was being too high on Mason.  Ogletree falls into the same category, inconsistent with playmaking ability, but I'd still put Jenkins over him. Both have a lot of upside, but I'm more confident in Jenkins due to the nature of his position. Corners often struggle early on, both Gilbert and Fuller were dreadful for most of the year. Jenkins, while inconsistent, was an overall quality starter from the beginning. Mental lapses hurt him from time to time, but the ability is still there."
StLouisRams,3dqw75,Pike09,2,Sat Jul 18 17:56:18 2015 UTC,I can concede that him and Ogletree are close enough that Jenkins taking it really isn't a big deal and Ogletree does make huge mental lapses sometimes (that first Seahawks game ugh).
StLouisRams,3dqw75,Vanscoten,0,Sat Jul 18 18:01:58 2015 UTC,Fuck Jenkins. Especially how he thinks he had say on the relocation. I can't stand that chump.

StLouisRams,3dqw75,axle69,2,Sun Jul 19 02:52:18 2015 UTC,"Lol nah he's been more blatant than just ""I love LA"" he said keep it domed or we're going to LA. He's a player not front office. It's tacky."
StLouisRams,3dqw75,Pike09,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:37:13 2015 UTC,I doubt even he is dull enough to think he had a decision on that. If I were a player and had to think about playing in Missouri winters without a dome I'd be a little heated too lol.

StLouisRams,3dn5q9,SoulardSTL,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous that the city's only putting $66 million into the stadium while the state's putting in over $300 million. KC only got $50 million for the Sprint Center, Arrowhead, and Kauffman combined, why should St. Louis get 6x as much?"
StLouisRams,3dn5q9,ajswdf,6,Fri Jul 17 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"With respect to our fellow major MO City, I'd think there are a few reasons why the STL stadium project may receive more monies than Arrowhead did for its 2010 redevelopment.   The main reason is Politics and Referendums. Remember that Jackson County voted in 2006 to approve up to $850MM in self-funded municipal bonds to pay for the entire project. Perhaps, by offering to cover so much of the costs ahead of seeking outside funding, KC / Jackson County inadvertently nixed their best opportunity to seek out increased State funding. Even after the total costs were reduced to $400MM, Jackson County was still self-authorized to issue up to $850MM in muni bonds, and maybe that made the project less attractive to the MO General Assembly to authorize more State capital to the project. If STL had a vote that would've authorized up to $1.5BB in self-funding towards new stadium projects, I bet we wouldn't have the State funding options and support that we do today.   Otherwise, there are likely other reasons why costs are different. Some of these reasons may include the scales of comparative project scopes (new stadium construction vs. existing stadium redevelopment), anticipated raw material costs, and changes in market expectations for project deliverables (how new NFL stadiums now cost $1BB+). Note that land acquisitions in STL for the site footprint are being covered by STL, not the State. Final cost estimates are expected at a future date upon completion of all acquisitions.   Side note: I'm totally in favor of supporting KC sports construction as revenue-generating investments into State infrastructure. Plus, I've had the tater tots covered in cheese and chili at Royals games, and those alone are worth State support, and some Tums."
StLouisRams,3dn5q9,ajswdf,-4,Fri Jul 17 18:39:17 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I do think the state should pitch in money for the St. Louis stadium. I just don't think it should pick up 80% of the public portion of the costs. It should be the reverse, where the city and county are paying 80% while the state pays 20%."

StLouisRams,3dfreg,D9-EM,5,Thu Jul 16 02:05:39 2015 UTC,I second this. I'm sure quick was on his way to a breakout season last year if it weren't for his injury. Hopefully he can bounce back and not have a slump.
StLouisRams,3dfreg,SonicRainboom,5,Thu Jul 16 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"T.J. McDonald. He definitely already has the skill, I say he's a good enough Safety to compete with even the Seahawk's secondary. Hopefully he'll soon get the recognition he deserves to be a star."

As a 9ers fan, I have to be happy about Hyde, but with a healthy Bush and a healthy Hunter to go along with a Hyde-esque back in Mike Davis, I don't think he'll be the workhorse many expect him to be, at least for this year. I think he breaks out year three. I hope I'm wrong about that though.  Quick started off the '14 season pretty strong didn't he? I could see him stepping up as the team's number one.  It's hard to pick one on the Seahawks because most of their guys have already broken out. I'd look at former second-round pick Justin Britt though. The line is horrible on paper, and someone will have to step up. I haven't looked into some of the others (Alvin Bailey, Patrick Lewis, etc.), but I know Okung is already considered good or great while J.R. Sweezy is a below average starter."

Completely run focused line, swapping reps with two studs, he's gonna be fresh all the time now. He was already a great running back, but now he's also gonna be facing some tough competition at his psotion to motivate him to become better. Unless Tre la Soul completely slumps this year, he can really only really improve. Either he becomes one of the best RB2 in the league, or we get one of the strongest RB commities in a long time."
StLouisRams,3dfreg,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:17:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Rams would pick a running back tenth overall if they were to take a committee approach.

The rookies weren't added to the roster until a month after the draft and it took another month to put any info on them or their numbers. Cignetti was OC for almost 6 months before his profile was updated and even then it wasn't changed just his title was changed.     Nothing to see here
StLouisRams,3dajvl,bozo7337,8,Wed Jul 15 00:21:21 2015 UTC,Agreed. Such a lack of simple care. It's as if... As if Rams ownership doesn't care for its fan base. Imagine that.  In other breaking news: Water is wet.

StLouisRams,3dajvl,SoulardSTL,13,Tue Jul 14 22:31:54 2015 UTC,"There's something else of note in the media book's release... Chip Rosenbloom is not shown to be Rams Chairman, but is mentioned only as a past-owner, along with his parents, Carroll Rosenbloom and Georgia Frontiere.   Up until very recently, Chip Rosenbloom was the Rams' acting Chairman, a titling that is still listed on the Rams' Wikipedia page. Same time, his sister, Lucia Rodriguez, is only mentioned in the biographical information for the Rosenbloom family, but up until recently she was the Rams' head of community outreach. Both Rosenbloom kids well mentioned in the 2014 Rams Media Guide.   Why do I think this is important? Both Chip & Lucia had retained a 30% ownership of the Rams even after selling Stan Kroenke the majority share in 2010. Kroenke had 40% pre-sale, then acquired an additional 30% from the Rosenbloom kids in 2010 and was to acquire the remaining 30% from them at ""a later date"". It seems that the ""later date"" of full acquisition of the Rosenbloom family's remaining 30% interest in the team has passed, and Kroenke appears to be the 100% owner of the Rams today.   Meanwhile, I've heard no announcement of the final ownership exchange between the Rosenbloom kids and Kroenke. I've also heard no news reports of Kroenke officially succeeding Chip Rosenbloom as Rams Chairman, nor of Lucia Rodriguez stepping down as head of community relations/outreach. I have no idea if this was a predetermined date for this exchange to have taken place, nor if there were supposed to be any conditions or ""high water marks"" before such an exchange was to have taken place.   Am I just missing a press release that was given a while back? Does the Rams 2015 Media Guide serve as that notice? Considering we're talking about a pretty heavy subject, I'd think the final exchange of the Rosenbloom family's involvement with the Rams would've garnered at least some news. After all, we are talking about an exchange of 30% of an NFL team's ownership, potential relocation or not.   If you have announcements of this equity exchange, or of the Rosenbloom kids stepping down, please post a link, because I'd like to know more about it. Thanks"
StLouisRams,3dajvl,ImTheBestMayne,3,Tue Jul 14 21:10:30 2015 UTC,This ESPN piece from March still lists them as minority owners but it's still very interesting considering everything going on right now.

StLouisRams,3dajvl,MizzouR,6,Sun Jul 19 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not officially buying my 2019 season tickets, but let me put it this way; I've heard from multiple groups that the Taylors are planning on buying the Rams, Raiders have literally have nothing, the Chargers are not far from the Raiders, Peacock and Blitz have made leaps and bounds to keep an NFL team in STL, Clayton has come out and said the sway is toward Carson, AB has signed a multi year deal with the Dome according to Karaker, $200 Million in PSL is predicted, well above what Nixon said.   And I'm not big on rising and falling values, but IF the NFL came out and said the Rams are staying in STL,  then wouldn't the Raiders and Chargers price tag automatically rise with them being the only viable options to LA? If you don't catch my drift, I'm asking is if Kroenke trying to buy the Raiders that extreme of an idea at this point, not that he will, but is it that crazy of an idea? Like I said, I still have my doubts and there are plenty of holes in STL as well. I could be 100% wrong and the Rams might be the only team to move to LA while SD and Oakland stay put, the fact of the matter is this, we aren't positive on anything."

It is very unlikely. Why would Kroenke want to do that? He already has an NFL team, he already has a year-to-year lease, and he has a stadium ready to be built. What does he have to gain from selling the Rams and buying the Raiders? Not to mention that the Rams are preferable to the Raiders in LA, since advertisers are don't want to be associated with the Raider brand. Not to mention that Davis has shown zero interest in selling the majority of the team, and is only willing to sell a minority if it helps him build a stadium.   Taylors are planning on buying the Rams   Just because they want to buy them doesn't mean they'll be able to. Like I said above, Kroenke has a good deal wih the Rams, so they'd have to way overpay for them in order to convince him to give them up.   Raiders have literally have nothing, the Chargers are not far from the Raiders   Just because they have a bad stadium situation doesn't mean they'll move to LA. There are other cities that don't have an NFL team that want one, San Antonio being the main one. The NFL isn't just going to let the two teams with the worst stadium situation move to LA.   Peacock and Blitz have made leaps and bounds to keep an NFL team in STL   But even they've basically admitted that the Rams are gone. That's why they're promoting St. Louis as an NFL city, not a Rams city, and Peacock has even said that Kroenke is determined to move to LA. Not to mention they'll likely either lose the court cases, which means they'll be in the same spot as San Diego, or even if they win the legislators can tie it up far beyond the time when the NFL decides who'll move by appealing their case.    Clayton has come out and said the sway is toward Carson   That's not what he said. He said he thinks Carson should be favored, citing the Oakland and San Diego stadium situation. He didn't have any sources or anything to back it up.   AB has signed a multi year deal with the Dome according to Karaker   This is irrelevant. Whether the Rams move to LA or play in the new stadium, they won't be playing in the dome for long. The dome will continue to be used for conventions.   $200 Million in PSL is predicted, well above what Nixon said.   That's incorrect, $200 million is if they sold every available seat. The report was overall down on St. Louis's viability as an NFL market."
StLouisRams,3dajvl,Popolar,3,Wed Jul 15 13:55:34 2015 UTC,"The stadium situation argument is a bad one.  I don't mean to offend, but just let me explain.  Teams not having a stadium means moving to LA is a threat. Like half of the NFL has had LA rumors right around the time their stadium leases were ending in the last 10 years. The three teams who currently need new stadiums are all rumoring a move to LA.  There's definitely a pattern there. Another interesting thing about this particular situation we have now is that all of the teams have major inconsistencies. They might be good, they might be bad. There's really no way to tell until this upcoming season.  It contradicts your other points about how moving to LA is such a good idea financially to Kroenke in his situation. It's a good financial deal to anyone, but it's also nice to have your stadium paid for in tax money. It is a very large investment despite the net worth of these money packed owners.  Hell, for all we know, they could just be perpetuating media about the rumors between the three teams in order to make the taxpayers buy as much of the stadiums as they can milk out of them. If these owners wanted to save a couple hundred million dollars, that would be the way to do it. (Probably not true)"

StLouisRams,3dajvl,ajswdf,0,Wed Jul 15 15:26:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you want an NFL team in St. Louis your best bet is to work towards a Cleveland-like deal. If the Rams are forced to stay they'll just keep using their 1 year leases until they can leave, while it's very unlikely that Kroenke trades teams with somebody. However, let the Rams leave and don't rush the stadium, then you'll be first in line for the next team that moves or expands. I think Nixon and his task force are thinking the same way."

StLouisRams,3dab3z,SoulardSTL,4,Tue Jul 14 22:38:34 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. In fact, Soulard is also home to a whole lot of bars, many of which host live Blues music regularly, and many of which run shuttles to Rams games (as well as Cardinals and Blues games). If you aren't in the mood to tailgate, your other best option would be to drive to Soulard, park for free, walk to a bar, grab a beer and a sandwich before the game, and take one of their free shuttles to the game. They'll pick you up afterwards, again for free, and take you back to the bar in Soulard. Personally, I'd recommend Hammerstone's, which has a great pre-game brunch and solid bloody mary's (and whose shuttle I've taken to plenty of games beforehand) as an alternative to the traditional Downtown game-day experience."
StLouisRams,3dab3z,NewBroPewPew,3,Tue Jul 14 22:43:24 2015 UTC,Yeah! I'm having a delicious bloody Mary flashback to the farmers market. I also tried to buy some raccoon meat there but my mom wouldn't let me ha. I did buy some Barack Obama scented oil there however!  This sounds up our alley.   How is so much of St. Louis free? I've been to the zoo and the botanical garden and the science museum (?) and its all free if I remember correctly. Thanks for the advice also.
StLouisRams,3dab3z,CyanRam,2,Tue Jul 14 22:57:16 2015 UTC,"Nice... Many of our museums, including the Zoo, are part of a taxing group where residents of STL City & County contribute to care and maintenance, thus allowing STL to offer many of our cultural institutions free to the public. This is all supplemented with various charitable trusts and foundations, with a very generous constituency in the STL community.   Meanwhile, we also have a lower cost of living than many other metro areas, something which is biting us in the ass right now as Kroenke claims STL is not as profitable as LA. Where we'll charge, say, $50 per ticket, LA will charge $150.   Have never eaten raccoon meat, but there is a great butcher in the market I go to, great steaks and fun meats like alligator. Good times."

I was able to get 3 lower level tickets and parking to the skins game last year for just $100. A lot of people are trying to get rid of their tickets in the days prior to the game and resort to practically giving away their seats if it's late enough. I intend to use craigslist this year for tickets to both the Redskins and the Ravens game.

StLouisRams,3d68ji,Seductive_Santa,14,Tue Jul 14 21:41:18 2015 UTC,"A few links about the EPA's view of the Carson site.  http://www.delamosuperfund.com/  http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/ViewByEPAID/CAD029544731  A quote from the second article:   Synthetic rubber was produced by manufacturing styrene and butadiene separately, piping them to the rubber plant, and then mixing the two together. Within each facility, wastes from the production processes were directed into separator units. Settled sludge from the separator units was disposed of either off site or in a waste disposal area located on site. Six unlined pits and three unlined evaporation ponds made up the 4-acre on-site disposal area. Upon closure in 1972, the unlined pits and ponds that were still open were covered with soil.  In 1984, contamination was discovered in the waste pit disposal area and underlying soils. Groundwater located beneath the site is heavily contaminated, but is not presently used as a source of drinking water. The deeper drinking water aquifer supplies 34,000 people located within 4 miles of the site. Today, the 4-acre waste pit disposal area is sealed with a RCRA-equivalent cap, and the waste pit area is undeveloped.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Amo_(Superfund_site)  http://www.latimes.com/science/la-me-del-amo-20150309-story.html#page=1  A quote from a Rams fan who lives in Carson and has for decades:   Montrose Chemical Corp. (another superfund site) occupied the property directly west of the proposed stadium site). They made mustard gas for the military during WWll, and after the war, DDT and PCB's for transformers. Their waste product was put in 55 gallon drums and then deposited in the landfill. On the other side, east of the landfill was a Shell Oil Refinery. Their waste was also put in the landfill. Other corporations throughout So. Cal. used the landfill for their toxic waste. There are an estimated 100,000 plus 55 gallon drums that have been deposited in that landfill over a 60 year period. These 55 gallon drums are rusting and corroding, and some of it is leaking to the surface. Here's the problem: Pilings have to be sunk to bedrock (estimated 40-50 feet deep), because of ""liquefaction"" (whenever there is an earthquake, like a building built on wet sand it will sink into the ground). cassions (pilings), sunk every 20 feet and filled with cement, keep this from happening, but this ground is not solid. there are some places where the garbage is 40 feet thick and turning to liquid sludge. There is also the concern that sinking the pilings will puncture more of the 55 gallon drums, creating more problems that it solves.   The NFL may favor the logistics of the Carson site, the teams it helps of the Carson site or any of a number of other reasons for favoring the Carson site. But there are clear EPA issues with that site. Lets put it this way. We're talking about 280 acres of prime real estate in southern California with great freeway access that for some reason has been vacant for 40 years. If that isn't a big red flag for something wrong with the site I'm not sure what is."
StLouisRams,3d68ji,bozo7337,9,Mon Jul 13 21:49:42 2015 UTC,Surely the Chargers Raiders & Goldman Sachs knows the EPA will shut them down if the toxic waist issue isn't dealt with. I assume they have a plan to deal with it. Maybe cap it somehow. We have a capped nuclear waist site in Earth City with hundreds of businesses around it. Obviously there isn't a stadium on top of it but there are tens of thousands of people near it every day.  Maybe something like that.   Edit: spelled waste wrong twice. God I'm retarded. lol
StLouisRams,3d68ji,D9-EM,8,Mon Jul 13 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"Again one of the quotes I provided even mentions you have to sink the pilings for the stadium foundation around 50 feet into the ground. That doesn't in this situation take them to solid bedrock. It takes you into and through a layer of toxic waste. My pointing this out wasn't attacking St Louis or the stadium. It was to point out current, unresolved and active EPA problems that must be resolved before they'll let anybody build there no matter how much money they throw at the place or how much they try to spin it as the solution to their stadium problems."

""Everything is done.""  Yemut said the site still needs a series of extraction wells to remove methane and other gases from 157 tainted acres, but it could be installed in six months to a year once a final plan for a stadium is approved.  The property, which includes an additional 11 acres outside the landfill, is already equipped with wells that pull out groundwater fouled with industrial solvents, he said. The water is then treated and piped into the sewer system.  lRelated NFL's return to L.A. sparks peak optimism amid latest developments NFL NFL's return to L.A. sparks peak optimism amid latest developments SEE ALL RELATED 8 Eventually, the parcel would be capped with high-density plastic to prevent garbage-spawned gases from leaking into the air. The cap would be topped with layers of new soil, Yemut said.  ""It will be expensive,"" he said of the remaining work, estimating the monthly costs of operating just the gas extraction wells at $200,000 to $300,000.  But Yemut and the department's manager for the Carson project, Daniel Zogaib, said a football venue would be ideal for the property, which runs along the 405's intersection with Del Amo Boulevard. That's because the wells and monitoring devices would not have to be pretzeled around numerous buildings, as they would in a housing or retail development.  ""The football stadium is much easier,"" said Zogaib. ""We could start remediating that right now."" The league itself has considered buying the Carson site at least three times. The land's tangled history as the old Cal Compact dump — a repository of heavy metals and pesticides — and as a lawsuit magnet had spooked investors for years. Among the previous promoters of its football potential to be ultimately frustrated was Hollywood deal-maker Michael Ovitz.  On Friday, NFL watchers said the cleanup puts Carson back in the game. ""It makes it far more likely that the project will go ahead,"" said Marc Ganis, a Chicago-based sports consultant. ""That's a major hurdle that's been removed.""  Yemut said the wells and monitors would remain in place permanently — and be largely invisible to football fans — to ensure there are no health risks. He said the stadium would be anchored on piles plunged deeply into the earth. Proper construction design would further mitigate any hazards from fires or earthquakes, he added.  ""This is a complex site, but we've been doing this for the past 15 years,"" he said.  All the costs have been shouldered by the landowners — most recently, Starwood Capital Group —and would be in the future, he said."" The taxpayers don't pay for these cleanups,"" Zogaib said."

Goodell is gonna sit these teams down and deals will be cut. If Kroenke does get LA, it won't be without some relatively heavy concessions to ensure that 1) the team he shares with doesn't get the shaft and 2) The odd man out has somewhere to go. The league has Carson in it's back pocket as leverage to make sure he plays ball. If Kroenke is encouraged to stay, efforts will be made to sweeten the pot in St. Louis, and keep Stan from ""going rogue"".    Nobody will get exactly what they want, and nobody will go home empty handed."
StLouisRams,3d68ji,yeeppergg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:39:35 2015 UTC,"Agree that it's not likely to get to 3 teams filing to reapply, at least I hope not for the League's sake...   The big variable that I see is that the Chargers and Raiders are co-committed into their Joint Venture, that they prefer to work with each other, and that they both do not want to work with Kroenke. Just as no one can force Kroenke to sell his team, no one can force either Spanos or Davis to work with Kroenke. It's been noted that both have a strong distaste for Kroenke, if not full disdain.   Consider that both the Chargers and Raiders are in full partnership, have already allocated capital into real estate acquisitions and preliminary administrative planning (including architecture and strategic consulting), have the full support of Goldman Sachs, and have a site that the League already considers ""viable"" and almost pursued itself a couple years back. That's a real hard nut to crack, even noting that there is now a real friendship between Spanos and Davis despite their teams' great rivalry.   It's not just that they'd have to convince either Spanos or Davis to commit to relocation in partnership with Kroenke; it's that they have to convince them to dissolve their existing partnership, equity already committed. Even getting past all that, if I was either Spanos or Davis, and I didn't hate Kroenke (yeah, right), I would expect no less than a full 50% partnership in the totality of Inglewood, including rights to ancillary development opportunities in both joint & independent partnership with Stonebridge Capital, and without equal up-front capital commitments to what Kroenke has already committed, scaled over time and fully based upon a percentage of future team earnings."
StLouisRams,3d68ji,Seductive_Santa,4,Tue Jul 14 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"I question how deeply invested the Chargers and Raiders are in Carson. They only actually purchased the 11 acres that can be easily resold or redeveloped. The remaining toxic ground was only transferred from one city entity to another, and the teams assume zero risk. They also still have several months of cleanup in order for the land to be ready. Kroenke meanwhile has had a small army of architects working for months on end on stadium designs, and they are currently working through the permitting process in order to break ground in December. The NFL has stated that both sites are ""viable"", per se, but if you dig into Inglewood is way out in front (that's not just me talking, other owners and local media have said the same thing).  You make good points, it's just that from my perspective Inglewood seems a lot more likely to happen. Mark Fabiani has acknowledged that the Bolts ending up in Inglewood is a possibility, and I think that there's more willingness to cut a deal than you might think, especially if the league helps to broker such an agreement. Carson is leverage not only against San Diego and Oakland, but also against Kroenke to make sure that deal is fair for whoever he would shack up with. Additionally, whoever gets cut out of the LA pie will get something to take the sting off losing out on $1 billion in additional net worth.   Just kinda wanted to offer another take on what could be happening.  God damn, this news is exhausting though haha."

StLouisRams,3d68ji,yeeppergg,-1,Fri Jul 17 16:47:32 2015 UTC,"""large lead.""  People who have a side in this fight constantly use wishy washy terms like this.  Carson has the same city approval, funding plan in place, real estate holdings, fronting co. created. They are about 6 months apart. Carson would be scheduled to open a year later (for now) than Inglewood...and that all depends on who sues who to delay it.  There is no real difference."
StLouisRams,3d68ji,Seductive_Santa,0,Fri Jul 17 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming Jed York, Jerry Jones, and the majority of LA media don't have some sort of bias.

I've read reports that Kroenke has outspent Spanos and Davis ten fold on this, and I've seen enough from a lot of sources to give the indication that Kroenke does have a tangible lead in this. Sorry the words of owners and people actually close to the stadium situation don't have any merit in your eyes.  I get that Carson could very well be built (I'm not a moron, or a shill) and I would probably become a Raider fan if it does, but having seen these plans come to the plate for so many years, Inglewood seems like the one that will happen based on a lot of metrics. I follow this news pretty much everyday, I'm not lying about anything. I also don't see what what I would have to gain telling a forum of mostly St. Louis folks that their team is leaving, but go ahead and label me with an agenda.  My only advice is to fear the words of Mark Fabiani and Carmen Policy. They are both proven liars in this whole thing.  Have a good day."

Again, do some reading. Of course he outspent them...they are only looking to build a stadium, financed through Goldman Sachs and using the Levis and Giants stadium deals as outlines.  I suggest you, again, do some reading on it. If they wanted to spend their own money they would stay in Oakland and San Diego.    and I've seen enough from a lot of sources to give the indication that Kroenke does have a tangible lead in this. Sorry the words of owners and people actually close to the stadium situation don't have any merit in your eyes.   Again, total bullshit.   Nobody has the lead in terms of stadiums.  The only thing that will determine who is moving is the NFL.  One stadium ""leading"" another by 6 months doesn't mean shit. You keep repeating bullshit.  Both stadiums are set up to be built with no roadblocks.   And Kroenke isn't a proven liar??  You do know what he said when he moved the team to St. Louis?  If you don't want to be accused of being a shill, don't come up with BS like this.  Its really tiresome to come across again and again and again."
StLouisRams,3d68ji,Seductive_Santa,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:45:21 2015 UTC,"Exhausting. Amen to that dude.   Understood that Carson is a full brownfield redevelopment with variables. I also get that Kroenke has had HKS Architects under contract for quite some time, the firm he's liked ever since he first saw Lucas Oil Stadium and had pitch the full rework to the EJD in STL (for which he wouldn't commit to STL past his lease even if the CVC agreed to build that out), and that Manica Architecture has been working on multiple iterations as the JV between the Chargers and Raiders has matured.   Then again, both Spanos and Davis like each other, and both hate Kroenke on a personal, almost visceral level. They're committed to each other and have invested their own monies together in pursuit of a mutual development they would share and have fully funded. They also have the votes to block a Rams relocation should they elect to block it, should that day ever come. And sure as anything the League doesn't want lawsuits against a franchise owner over relocation; even if they'd win they'd still lose PR.   How's this... Say Carson wasn't a brownfield in need of environmental remediation. If they had clean land that was ready for development, would you think the Chargers/Raiders would be more in front for relocation? If Carson's environmental issues weren't at play, would you consider their JV to be ahead of Inglewood? Would the League be more in favor of a Chargers/Raiders new stadium if it could be built faster, and cleaner, in another LA location? If this option existed, would Inglewood still be a real consideration?"

Printed stories more readily risk libel or conjecture issues if reporters attempt to overtly state how other people feel about third parties. However, if someone on a radio or TV interview states something offhand, then it's largely not going to be redistributed in a readily accessible medium and bring risk to the distributor. If you're interested, do a check on podcasts involving Spanos and Kroenke, both on news radio and sports radio broadcasts, and you should find what you're looking for. Check Twitter, too. I remember there being tweets discussed a while back about how Spanos won't even look Kroenke in the face out of personal disdain, but I forget who tweeted them. That all said, I do not have a printed media report stating explicitly Spanos' personal feelings for Kroenke. Spanos' dispassionate avarice for Kroenke, however, can be found."
StLouisRams,3d68ji,alderaan_never4get,4,Wed Jul 15 20:23:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I can say that from a biased perspective, I think the Inglewood Stadium is cooler than the Carson one. It's Cowboy Stadium with a glass roof, and for the long term future of the NFL in LA, I support that one being built (this probably isn't the forum to say that in, but whatever).  That said, the impetus behind Carson makes more sense, as the Raiders and Chargers need a new home more than the Rams do. So if the two plans were on equal footing, then I would agree Carson would probably be the heavy favorite at this point. However, the progress on the stadium has some merit in this case, and Kroenke has made the most aggressive play for Los Angeles of the three. If that didn't carry any weight, then Kroenke wouldn't factor into the equation as much as he does now.  I also don't know that having the votes to block is going to matter in this case. The league will sit down with these three owners and hash something out, and the fact that's what will likely happen is what makes this all so hard to predict. Owners draw a hard line and talk a big game, but once the chips are down there's no telling what kind of deal they will ultimately come to."

Still, I'm apprehensive of Inglewood for being a tad gaudy as well as wondering about the site location as part of a comprehensive new urbanist development, but still it is a pretty building. (The revamped Carson isn't so bad, either, and it is definitely conducive to tailgating and the fan experience.) Same time, pretty alone won't win this...  Here's a thought that's been discussed before, not to re-hash something that may not be prescient, but I'd appreciate your thoughts. Taking what we think would be the advantage for the Chargers/Raiders if Carson was not a challenged brownfield... What would happen if a serious effort was underway to resurrect the Farmers Field concept for the Chargers/Raiders JV? Would that trump Inglewood? I know that Phil Anschutz has said he's washed his hands on FF, but with AEG's StubHub Center in play as a temporary site, and Anshultz' potential vendetta on Kroenke (former best friend) for having torpedoed FF with the Inglewood play, what do you think would happen if Carson was dumped in favor of Downtown LA as presented before?

StLouisRams,3cxwcq,cbaumber,11,Sat Jul 11 19:38:32 2015 UTC,I feel like we're going to do a complete overhaul of our current uniform when we do change them. But I think it'll just depend on if we move to LA or stay put. If we stay I would like to do a modern take on the throwbacks but if we move they'll probably embrace the vintage look.
StLouisRams,3cxwcq,To3z,4,Sat Jul 11 20:48:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true, the LA decision probably is looming large over any type of redesign."

StLouisRams,3cxwcq,MrPublicDomain,3,Sun Jul 12 03:33:01 2015 UTC,They technically can do that.  The helmet rule only applies to the shell.  As long as they use the same blue shell they can swap out any color horn decal they'd like.

StLouisRams,3csig2,axle69,3,Fri Jul 10 15:18:37 2015 UTC,This isn't a very good list.

StLouisRams,3csig2,frankoftank,3,Fri Jul 10 15:05:30 2015 UTC,71 catches 900 yards. Better than any receiver we have.
StLouisRams,3csig2,nagasakiboomboom,2,Sat Jul 11 04:56:50 2015 UTC,"In a pass heavy offense with a good QB and OBJ taking the attention off of him. Plus 260 yards in the final two games against our struggling secondary and the Eagle's piss poor secondary. Still only managed 3 TDs all year, and we gifted him one of those. Quick matched that in 2 games. Randle also managed to get himself benched for a game or two despite the Giant's desperation for WRs.  I wouldn't take Randle over any of our receivers right now. He's a possession receiver who seems to struggle with consistency in his hands and focus. Relatively slow and limited potential. The stats don't tell the story."
StLouisRams,3csig2,frankoftank,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:20:23 2015 UTC,"He may not be terrific, but at least he's put up some numbers.

StLouisRams,3cp9lj,mlasn,16,Thu Jul 9 17:55:14 2015 UTC,This was really the only guy I heard talked about for the supplemental draft and it looks like we took him.
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,undead_tortoise,9,Thu Jul 9 17:55:40 2015 UTC,I don't think it would be a stretch to credit the Bradford/Foles trade for this. Having two extra picks next draft makes this move a lot more comfortable.
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,avanhokie,5,Thu Jul 9 18:47:16 2015 UTC,Yeah allows us to take the risk because this guy (if he reaches his potential) is a starter on our line for years to come. Even if he is only a career back-up we only spent a 5th!
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,undead_tortoise,12,Fri Jul 10 00:18:02 2015 UTC,"I'm really beginning to appreciate the commitment to offense. Even if our OL is just barely average this season, this team is going to look a lot different."
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,price-iz-right,3,Thu Jul 9 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"This is the truest statement of the off season and all fans need to get behind it.  Fuck the QB woes  Fuck the WR consistency  Fuck the secondary questions  This team goes nowhere without a competent OL, and we have not had one in many years  A competent (not even great) but average OL will change every aspect of our game this year. I hope the new guys pan out"
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,chemicalpoisons,12,Sun Jul 12 18:25:04 2015 UTC,His surname is definitely something to get pumped about.
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,ThomJonson,11,Thu Jul 9 18:20:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm pretty excited to have ""I Battle"" on the team... Now if we could just get rid of ""I Pead""..."
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,bluemandan,5,Fri Jul 10 03:24:52 2015 UTC,Can someone please explain the supplemental draft to this hockey fan?
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,bluemandan,13,Thu Jul 9 20:18:13 2015 UTC,It is basically for players who don't enter regular draft and then run into some problems (usually about to get kicked off team or something similar) and then can choose to enter an extra draft. Basically you can either pick a player or pass. If you pick a player you lose that draft pick in the next year draft. So the Rams lost their 5th round pick in the next year draft.   There was 7 players eligible this year and only one got picked. Not uncommon for nobody to be drafted.
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,avanhokie,5,Thu Jul 9 20:22:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you.   I was confused about the Rams grabbing this guy in the fifth, but not seeing anyone drafted in rounds 1 - 4.  Your explanation clears things up."
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,pdsc0407,4,Thu Jul 9 20:25:52 2015 UTC,Also the guy we picked was said to be a third round talent if he was in this years draft. A couple of analysts I heard say that he could have been a first rounder if he stayed in school another year.
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,pdsc0407,10,Fri Jul 10 00:15:52 2015 UTC,Let's goooo!!!! Saw he was a second round talent.  Hopefully this will pay huge dividends.
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,BluLemonade,4,Thu Jul 9 18:02:14 2015 UTC,It looks like he was being mocked for the 4th round
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,avanhokie,6,Thu Jul 9 18:10:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I saw if he played at Clemson again this year that he had first to second round talent.  There's no way a fourth round talent would get a fifth round pick in the supplemental draft"
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,ImTheBestMayne,9,Thu Jul 9 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going to Clemson right now. I don't follow the OL that much but he's the only name I know from them. Considering that our run protection was pretty solid, I think this is a good pickup"
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,BilllyMayes,3,Thu Jul 9 19:46:14 2015 UTC,I heard Mark Dominik the analyst and former Falcons GM said if he spent another year at Clemson he would be a top 20 pick. Exciting potential but they said he will need a bit of time to adjust to the league
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,cariboustew28,2,Fri Jul 10 00:13:35 2015 UTC,Anyone know more about this guy? He looks kind of skinny in the pictures I've seen but who knows.
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,Tre2,3,Thu Jul 9 18:48:44 2015 UTC,Here is a Bleacher Report on him. From what I have seen he is athletic but has off field issues and character issues.
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,BilllyMayes,7,Thu Jul 9 18:53:38 2015 UTC,"Fisher seems to know what he is doing when it comes to character issues. Case in point, Britt."
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,PRE_-CISION-_,7,Thu Jul 9 19:09:01 2015 UTC,Jenkins and Ogletree had off-field issues before the draft as well right? I feel like that's why Ogletree fell to us at 30.
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,TweetPoster,4,Thu Jul 9 20:24:56 2015 UTC,"Britt still has off field things going on, but he keeps them off the field."

StLouisRams,3cp9lj,bozo7337,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"Sneaky pick up if you ask me, watched him on TV a few times and he looked pretty good, overwhelmed at times, but that's when Clemson had QB problems and the odd time against a really good DE.  And hell, if we can afford to give him a year who knows how he can do, just stay out of trouble listen to the coaches and you can compete."
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,bozo7337,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:51:59 2015 UTC,"Boudreau has his work cut out to get this guy to perform. He has good size and measurables but the game tape really doesn't support him being much more than what we spent on him, a 5th rounder. Couple with the off field stuff and I'm not going to hold my breath on Battle."
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,cardsfan1343,2,Thu Jul 9 20:08:25 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about him, but 5 minutes of googling and I learned people smarter than me thought he was a 4th-5th round talent."
StLouisRams,3cp9lj,bozo7337,2,Fri Jul 10 00:56:01 2015 UTC,And there are opinions out there by those same people that had he returned to school he was a 1st or 2nd round talent in the 2016 draft. But many felt that he wasn't going to go for more than a 4th rounder in the supplemental.

StLouisRams,3cooxz,cariboustew28,4,Thu Jul 9 16:31:40 2015 UTC,He's definitely got the work ethic and talent to be the best no. 2-sized receiver in the league. Hopefully he can put it all together with steady QB play.
StLouisRams,3cooxz,The_Wayward,6,Thu Jul 9 16:57:05 2015 UTC,"He's probably got the best hands of anyone on our team, and he's constantly working on his route running.

StLouisRams,3cp6lw,ssemkciN,2,Fri Jul 10 20:07:56 2015 UTC,That was my question too.
StLouisRams,3cp6lw,rloftis6,3,Sun Jul 12 13:41:23 2015 UTC,Considering he had a metric boat  load of 40+ yard catches and that was with Hill/Davis missing him deep open or not even seeing him at least once a game.  Yeh big things!

StLouisRams,3crkeh,sgabriele,12,Fri Jul 10 05:08:35 2015 UTC,"I guess anything's possible, but I don't buy it.   Just because somebody works for ESPN doesn't mean they know what's going on. How many people at ESPN have even had a conversation with Kroenke? Why would he spend so much money on Inglewood if he was planning on just buying the Broncos? I really doubt he'd want to move them, so he'd have this very expensive piece of land with no stadium. Are there any indications that the Bowlen family wants to sell the team? Kroenke is in a great spot with the Rams. If he moves them to LA, they'll probably be worth more than the Broncos, but he bought them for way less than the Broncos would cost.  It's well known that Kroenke wants to own his own stadium. However, the Broncos are currently on a lease to play at Mile High until 2031. As you probably know, the Rams are on a year-to-year lease at the Edward Jones Dome. Kroenke's current position is much better for eventually owning his own stadium."
StLouisRams,3crkeh,ajswdf,5,Fri Jul 10 17:19:17 2015 UTC,"I've heard the rumor that Kroenke wants Denver, and Taylor would be the one to buy, but I can't say I've heard Kroenkes endgame was this. I'm thankful that a good message is being spread around ESPN though, even if it is a rumor. I guess we'll have to let the chips fall.  With that plus the news that AB just signed a multi year deal with the Dome today, I can go into the weekend with some reasonable confidence."
StLouisRams,3crkeh,MizzouR,2,Fri Jul 10 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"/u/sgabriele: I've heard similar stories being told around the scene, but not involving the Taylor Family. Not as a knock to the Taylors, of course; they're great people, have the means, have a commitment to STL, and absolutely are great Rams fans (I've actually sat in their seats before and had a couple beers snuck to me by my host from Jack's luxury box - good times). Hands down, they'd be great owners.   That all said, I've heard rumors - and I claim them only as rumors, self-acknowledging no credibility any more than that - that other interested parties have also been considering making a play for the Rams. These include another STL-based billionaire business leader (credible), as well as a consortium from Chicago investment professionals with local ties, and the founder of FedEx. There also is prospective local ownership of a MLS franchise in STL, but from what I know these are not the same prospective purchasers of the Rams should they ever come up for sale. And this last part is the kicker...  All these rumors mean nothing if Kroenke doesn't want to sell. No sale can be forced, it'd have to be his decision to part with the team. And unless the Bowlen Family Trust decides to sell their team to him sometime soon, he won't sell the Rams.

With the trend of starters playing fewer and fewer minutes every year in preseason games, it's even a risk that teams are trying to reduce at the small expense of less preparation/practice. What you hate to see are injuries unrelated to football. But even then, some of those are unavoidable and innocent (car crashes, accidents, etc.). What you despise seeing are avoidable injuries caused by stupidity and recklessness. An NFL player's career depends on his body. Take care of it.

StLouisRams,3ch1y2,SoulardSTL,11,Tue Jul 7 21:14:40 2015 UTC,"Takeaways: Forecasts for PSL sales are above $200MM in revenues. This is higher than the Task Force's estimates of $120-30MM in revenues. This bodes well for STL in sourcing capital and gauging strong market demand.   Where STL could demonstrate weakness is in ticket revenues and market expansion. The lower ticket sales revenues are largely due to the region's lower cost of living analysis when compared to markets like LA. Or, it's cheaper to live in STL than in LA, so things are less expensive, including tickets. Meanwhile, market expansion is considered limited in that the number of companies that are buying the luxury boxes and blocks of tickets remain about the same as before. Or, we haven't seen a major increase in major (i.e. Fortune 500) corporations in STL, even as the region has maintained its considerable corporate presence, and as they have robustly increased their revenues over time.   For comparison's sake, STL Metro has a population of 3MM and is home to 9 Fortune 500 companies (and 18 Fortune 1000 companies). In 2005, STL also had 9 F500 companies. Los Angeles Metro has a population of 18.55MM and is home to I believe 15 Fortune 500 companies (not sure how many Fortune 1000 companies). Note that San Diego has only 2 Fortune 500 companies. Baltimore remains the largest metro area in the US without a F500 corporate HQ.   Any additional comparative data points are appreciated."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,eight26,5,Tue Jul 7 22:47:14 2015 UTC,"There are 45 Fortune 1,000 companies in the LA metro area.  There are plenty of corporate dollars to tap. There are a lot of people hungry for the NFL. There is even a site shovel ready.  We just don't have a team explicitly saying they're coming. Unfortunately for us, that's the key ingredient."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,eight26,6,Wed Jul 8 00:59:11 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, you should really recheck that 45 number. Maybe F1000 companies, but surely not 45 F500 companies...   Actually, can you cite the source where you found 45? Asking in pure curiosity, as my professional work includes extensive research into regional & geographically-specific market analysis. Thanks"
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,eight26,3,Wed Jul 8 06:18:00 2015 UTC,"I wrote Fortune 1,000.  I got the number here by setting the filters to ""Los Angeles"" in the Metro Area field."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,eight26,2,Wed Jul 8 14:50:03 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, my bad. That's what I get when checking messages late at night...   So here's my tally:   F500: STL - 9 LA - 15  F1000: STL: 18 LA: 45  All this demonstrates that LA is a large market with more big corporate HQs, while STL has a very high per capita concentration of large corporate HQs in a market smaller than LA."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,eight26,2,Wed Jul 8 17:12:46 2015 UTC,I wonder how many companies are interested in corporate blocks. I'm with one of those F500s. We have a suite at Staples. I'm not sure we'd get in on an Inglewood suite though. I have no first hand knowledge of that. It's just the sense I get based on the environment these days.
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,Kaos047,0,Wed Jul 8 21:03:35 2015 UTC,"For LA, there'll be real big demand for luxury boxes and blocks of seats for whichever stadium gets built. On one hand, there's the big corporate plus of taking prospects and executives to games, the fun of doing the new, in-demand thing. I'm not sure what the entertainment industry's proximity could do to buying seats, but having big name star in the front row, on the week of their new movie/record, could be a draw to certain companies buying certain seats. Still, you'll have demand for PSLs in whatever gets built out there. Advantage to the corporations buying PSLs, as those things aren't cheap.   For STL, pretty much every F1000 company has a suite, box, or both. Demand is definitely strong, just not as strong (expensive) as what LA will witness. Where the report suggested that the STL market is limited reflects that most every big company has already bought luxury suites and/or blocks of seats.   And in both LA & STL, there'll be the individual PSL buyers and luxury suite buyers, just that the STL personal luxury suites are usually owned by families of industrialists with multi-generational wealth, and LA personal luxury suites will have Tom Cruise and whoever else sitting in them.   Variables are at play in both markets for PSLs... In LA, you'll likely end up with both the Chargers and Raiders in Carson. There, I'd think PSLs would be sold two times over for each seat: rights to buy tickets for Seat A1, etc. for the Chargers, and rights to buy tickets for Seat A1, etc. for the Raiders. Easy way to double-dip into the pot. Something similar could happen in STL: PSLs for Rams games, and maybe additional PSLs for a future MLS team. An idea has been that the Rams could be amenable to splitting revenues from MLS attendees at the new stadium they'd help to build. (And yeah, I know, Carson isn't set in stone just yet, but I just don't want to conceive ""Inglewood"" for my team today)."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,eight26,4,Wed Jul 8 21:47:00 2015 UTC,"Objectively, I really have a hard time seeing Carson come to fruition but maybe."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,Kaos047,2,Wed Jul 8 22:21:16 2015 UTC,"I'm reading that Executive Summary differently than you are. Total inventory of PSLs is $204M. The survey indicated demand of $189M. Then once pricing was introduced, the percent of people that would follow through is ~70%. So forecasted PSL revenue is about $132M."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,eight26,-1,Wed Jul 8 01:29:48 2015 UTC,This is incorrect. Dave Peacock one of the two leads on the stadium project was on the local ESPN radio. He stated that the 70% figure is referring to how many current PSL holders will buy new PSLs in the new stadium.  The 189 - 205 million from the new stadium PSL sales is the correct estimate for revenue and has already factored the 70% purchase rate.
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,Kaos047,3,Wed Jul 8 04:21:25 2015 UTC,"I see. So even though Ram PSLs have the worst rate of return of any team, the plan is to sell more than in '95 at a higher price even though only 70% of current holders would rebuy. Who is buying these other 25,000 PSLs to reach the $189M total?"
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,eight26,-4,Wed Jul 8 05:28:41 2015 UTC,Why don't you go speak with the professionals that created this paper? You sure seem to know more than them. Maybe you could even give them some pointers!
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,Kaos047,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:03:55 2015 UTC,I forecast demand on the order of $500M a year in my professional life. So there's that.
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,eight26,-3,Wed Jul 8 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"Great, then you should be aware of how many variables go into these forecast and will stop making stupid comments trying to downplay this news as bad news for STL."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,bozo7337,4,Wed Jul 8 18:33:04 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it's bad news. I'm asking how it all comes together given the history with PSLs in St Louis.
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,bozo7337,0,Wed Jul 8 18:45:19 2015 UTC,"Your comment comes off as condescending and sarcastic, especially given your comment history here. You know or should know that no one on this board can answer that question. Lets be honest here, it was a sarcastic remark."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,bozo7337,7,Wed Jul 8 18:52:15 2015 UTC,"I don't pretend to know who knows what here. You never know who is behind a user name. My comment history generally falls into two categories: Fisher sucks (my right as a lifelong fan to have that opinion) and how the hell does the stadium planning think they're going to pay for this thing without Kroenke's checkbook (genuinely interested in any speculative answers). But since I'm from LA, I get downvotes regardless of how much supporting evidence I cite. Meh. I was a fan before /r/stlouisrams and I'll be one well after this sub, or indeed the entire site, disappears into the ether. That said, if the tone you infer doesn't sit well with you, then ignore me, block me, or just move on."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,bozo7337,0,Wed Jul 8 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"I'm curious though on the sale of PSL's. Isn't this the teams money and not the stadiums? You're selling a license for the seat(s) in question for Rams events, not every event at the stadium. Just curious how these actually work."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,bozo7337,0,Tue Jul 7 23:07:58 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, the creation of Personal Seat Licenses has predominantly been used to generate the revenues necessary for a new stadium's development, including construction costs. While they can also be sold by a team to fund general revenues, their use has almost exclusively been to generate additional pre-construction liquid cash flows. After all, PSLs aren't tickets, just the right to purchase tickets for specific seats the PSL holder retains. The Rams Organization still would generate all revenues from sales of the tickets, so consider PSLs as a pure revenue generator.   Here, the RSA has sought to sell PSLs in order to generate revenues towards the stadium's construction, a stadium that the RSA would own and operate as a regional (public) asset. This is not the Rams selling PSLs, as they have kept quiet throughout.   What this revenue forecast from PSL sales demonstrates are: (1) a strong demand by the existing marketplace for the product (NFL games), and (2) the greater viability of the Task Force's & RSA's financing plans for the North Riverfront Stadium."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,ajswdf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:20:07 2015 UTC,So now the RSA is telling the Rams who's going to their games and the Rams have no choice in the matter? The Rams sell tickets to their events in the EJD not the RSA. It's my understanding that these are something that teams sell for their events and it's their revenue. In fact if you search Edward Jones Dome PSL it gives you info and refers you to the Rams website. The sale of PSL looks like revenue for the team not the stadium owner.  http://www.pslsource.com/st_louis_rams/edward_jones_dome/  Interesting situation.
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,apiratewithadd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:29:30 2015 UTC,"More like the RSA is bringing in the eventual purchasers of season tickets to Rams games, who will still buy their season tickets from the Rams Organization, by selling them the rights to buy these tickets via PSLs. It's the same business model that's been done before in STL and the same model underway in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and other NFL stadiums across the U.S. It'd be disingenuous to say the RSA is ""telling"" the Rams who they will sell tickets to without any choice, as if they're being forced upon them; rather, the Rams Organization is being provided consumers of their product by a partnering third party.   Note that PSL Holders have first rights to buy tickets based on the seats for which they hold licenses. Should a PSL Holder not exercise their first rights of purchase, the box office can sell those seats' corresponding tickets to whomever they like.  This also is subject to change as a framework should the Rams Organization choose to cooperatively work with the RSA, should negotiations take place in the future."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,ajswdf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:05:51 2015 UTC,"Again my statement still stands, the Rams sell tickets to their games and revenues are the teams. PSL's allow people to purchase certain seats and have first rights to them. Keep in mind I hate PSL's they're just another way to stiff us the general public of money for the pleasure of going to a game.   http://www.pslsource.com/st_louis_rams/edward_jones_dome/  Everything there tells me that PSL's are a revenue stream for the team not the stadium owner. Googling PSL for Edward Jones Dome brings up nothing but Rams. They don't sell PSL's for anything but Rams games. All this leads me to believe this is a club revenue stream.    the Rams Organization is being provided consumers of their product by a partnering third party.   They don't need a 3rd party for consumers."
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,ajswdf,0,Wed Jul 8 00:19:09 2015 UTC,How about this... Pre-construction: development costs. Post-construction: general revenues.
StLouisRams,3ch1y2,The49ersBlow,2,Wed Jul 8 00:25:54 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying and the point you're making and I'm not trying to be argumentative or negative to St Louis or the stadium. The concept that PSL's and ticket sales wouldn't be the clubs, keep in mind revenue share from each would be imo a part of the lease agreement, just doesn't make sense to me. Also looking back at some recent stadiums built and the PSL's generated they all seem to come in at 2/3 of estimates. And those are for successful clubs. Just food for thought I'm typing out as I think about it."
StLouisRams,3cghwj,Seductive_Santa,4,Tue Jul 7 18:55:25 2015 UTC,"Nothing really new here, these are stats that are all well known. The big thing is the swap of season ticket holder revenue in favor of tax dollars for a new stadium. However, I have a theory that the Rams will see a rise in Tickets sales this season. There are a few factors that I believe will affect the ticket sales positively:   The threat of the Rams leaving. New, and exciting players in Foles and Gurley. The real ability to battle for first place in the NFCW Along with that, some wins. A Winning season would generate a ton of revenue.   Long-term you can look to improving sales with a new stadium in a renovated area."
StLouisRams,3cghwj,Thonked,20,Tue Jul 7 19:21:35 2015 UTC,The threat of the Rams leaving.   Threat of a move has always had negative impact on ticket sales.
StLouisRams,3cghwj,bwc_28,3,Tue Jul 7 20:13:47 2015 UTC,"You beat me to the punch. Any team that has an extended period of sucking without being a big name franchise (Packers will always have fans in attendance, not that I really imagine them sucking any time soon) will have poor ticket sales. That's just how sports go. The past two seasons, yeah, we were probably more competitive than we should have been without a legitimate starting quarterback for most of those seasons, but who wants to pay to see ""more competitive than expected""?"
StLouisRams,3cghwj,Fungo,2,Tue Jul 7 19:33:11 2015 UTC,"the lack of a “robust regional area” from which to draw new fan and corporate support   considering there are a number of markets in the NFL smaller than STL, how does this statement even make sense."

StLouisRams,3c7xo4,ForSucksFake,16,Sun Jul 5 19:07:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say the reason they have him on the list is that they probably think everyone in St.L expects Foles to come in and drop another 27-2 season.  If you expect 27-2, you probably are going to be disappointed.  Foles stats will probably be a little above average for the Rams, but all we really wanted to get from the deal was a consistent, accurate, QB that will be on the field."
StLouisRams,3c7xo4,Cloud324,12,Sun Jul 5 19:44:58 2015 UTC,"but all we really wanted to get from the deal was a consistent, accurate, QB that will be on the field.   Really, all the Rams want is this :'("

StLouisRams,3c7xo4,Sauceman87,3,Mon Jul 6 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"I'm expecting 25/15 if he gets a full season in. Obviously the 27/2 is well beyond what we can expect, especially considering our O-line and scheme compared to the Eagles from the past two seasons. But I think he will play well enough to give us a chance at a wildcard spot if he can stay healthy all season."
StLouisRams,3c7xo4,Pobert-Raulson,3,Sun Jul 5 21:01:44 2015 UTC,"Yep. I'm not gonna have him on my fantasy team, but he's going to be a game manager. We are just gonna ground and pound I believe. If we have to open it up, we should have a good QB for it."
StLouisRams,3c7xo4,New_DudeToo,6,Sun Jul 5 22:04:48 2015 UTC,because he's not playing in chip kelly's system anymore which favors the QB and the stats they put up.
StLouisRams,3c7xo4,danmauller,5,Sun Jul 5 20:00:28 2015 UTC,He's also not playing with as good an OL or RB which doesn't help
StLouisRams,3c7xo4,hlainelarkinmk2,12,Sun Jul 5 20:29:25 2015 UTC,"Gurley has the potential to be every bit as good as mccoy in my opinion. And we have no idea what this O line's gonna be. Might suck, might kill it."

StLouisRams,3c7xo4,hlainelarkinmk2,5,Sun Jul 5 20:34:21 2015 UTC,But they were not healthy and statistically they were one of the worst in the pass game blocking. So we are not going to grade Foles on what the O-Line he played behind could have been.
StLouisRams,3c7xo4,NewBroPewPew,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:48:48 2015 UTC,He missed half that season anyway.
StLouisRams,3c7xo4,rloftis6,3,Sun Jul 12 13:45:14 2015 UTC,"Not just your opinion. I read somewhere that Eagles run blocking line was #1 in the league by the end of the season last year...it was repeated constantly in /r/nfl when the Cowboys fans were exclaiming that ""Murray overrated, Eagles don't have a line, any RB can replace him"".  That being said,  Our run blocking is quite decent. It's the reason any of our RB are decent these past few years. Our pass blocking is the problem, which lead to forced throws and plays by sub par QB  I hold that if our pass blocking improves to average this year and our run blocking stays on par with last year, Foles will be able to make some decent plays. Our WRs are there, we just need to give Foles time to throw and he'll hit his mark. Anytime the D cheats back out RBs will tear it up.   It's going to take 6 games for us to figure all that out though with our new O coordinator (assuming he isn't a stubborn ass like Shitenheimer). Last year our D took a while to sync. This year our O will take a while.   Let's all remember to be patient and not burn the house down with a loss at the beginning of the season."
StLouisRams,3c7xo4,price-iz-right,5,Wed Jul 15 20:27:57 2015 UTC,His O-Line and RB he played with last year weren't any better than what ours is going to be honestly. His O-Line in his 8 games were mostly backups and McCoy was sucking it up early on. He still went 6-2.
StLouisRams,3c7xo4,axle69,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:23:50 2015 UTC,"They were still a lot better. Evan Mathis could be considered the best guard in football, and we're going to be starting several rookies (or giving them significant playing time) this season."
StLouisRams,3c7xo4,rloftis6,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:44:33 2015 UTC,"He probably is or at least right behind Yanda and ours won't be perfect but Saffold is no scrub at guard when healthy and Robinson should be better. Just have to hope any of the new guys aren't gonna be too bad. I expect us to have 3 people on the line that have never taken a snap in the NFL before (Jones, Havenstein, and Brown) of the three the one I expect to do poorly is Brown. The other two won't be great or anything but won't be a problem."

StLouisRams,3c52jl,genericpoop,11,Sat Jul 4 21:30:14 2015 UTC,I think it might have to do with the fact its much easier to study opponent's special teams than it is their offense or defense. There isn't a whole lot of different plays you can run on special teams compared to offense and defense so it becomes easier to see how disciplined they are and what their tendencies are.

StLouisRams,3c52jl,NewBroPewPew,7,Mon Jul 6 20:41:48 2015 UTC,6 seasons over 10 wins. Went 13-3 with Kerry Collins as his QB.   Rams before Fisher:  3-13  2-14  1-15  7-9  2-14  You can keep repeating the standard ESPN bs about average coach and what not. But that is kinda tired and not really well thought out. So I am done with this conversation.  Once again you have to look at the circumstances. You can't take over the worst team in the nfl with the worst statistical decade in the history of the game and make the playoffs the next year. But whatever you really don't seem to like logic.

StLouisRams,3c52jl,PRE_-CISION-_,2,Mon Jul 6 21:39:34 2015 UTC,I'm curious who you think should be or have been the coach of the Rams? Your clearly against Fisher so you must have someone in mind? IMO Fisher has been a godsend for this organization and to this point sure we haven't been in the playoffs but what we needed more than anything was stability and a change in culture. We did not have anyone on this roster when he got here and look at it now. I would argue up until this season we haven't had a chance in hell to compete for anything. Give Fisher a season or two more before you start calling for his head.
StLouisRams,3c52jl,crackalac,12,Tue Jul 7 18:40:04 2015 UTC,He may have had a lot of mediocre teams but I think he's a great coach. How many seasons has he had an elite quarterback?

Maybe it depends on how you define ""great"" for a coach.  To me, great means Super Bowl winning.  Fisher is far from great and that's not the QBs' fault.  He's mediocre."
StLouisRams,3c52jl,crackalac,8,Sat Jul 4 23:44:05 2015 UTC,He made it in 99 and almost beat the buzz saw that was the greatest show on turf. And that was with Steve McNair.

StLouisRams,3c52jl,crackalac,4,Sun Jul 5 00:06:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying if you look at any of the greatest coaches, you are almost always going to find an equally great quarterback that played under them."

StLouisRams,3bwd4s,ChalupaLoompa,-2,Fri Jul 3 03:47:20 2015 UTC,But the topic states St Louis rams. Take that word out and I'm fine.
StLouisRams,3bwd4s,crackalac,2,Fri Jul 3 03:51:23 2015 UTC,"<ahh> never mind, dude. Pointless."
StLouisRams,3bwd4s,ChalupaLoompa,-6,Fri Jul 3 04:02:00 2015 UTC,So you see what im getting at?   I'm not gonna start listing members of the St Louis Browns on the all time Baltimore orioles list.
StLouisRams,3bwd4s,crackalac,6,Fri Jul 3 04:08:41 2015 UTC,"Dude. St Louis native and fan here. This thread is clearly about the Rams in general and not just the St Louis part of her franchise. This isn't a case of the oilers or Baltimore Colts. This is the same shit as the Raiders, and Chargers. No need to soap box this one I know everyone's a little on edge around here but the Rams are the Rams regardless of if it was old LA guys or the current idols in the St Louis ones."
StLouisRams,3bwd4s,axle69,2,Fri Jul 3 15:05:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I think he's just missing the point

StLouisRams,3bvi48,PeteJones6969,14,Thu Jul 2 14:17:26 2015 UTC,"As long as he can stay healthy he'll be a huge upgrade over what we've had to deal with the last 3-4 years. I think Bradford is great and can tear it up if he can stay on the field, but after two straight season ending injuries and several other less serious injuries that still hampered him, we just couldn't hitch our wagon to him anymore. We got an acceptable replacement in Foles, made some cap room, got some draft picks and sent Bradford to a team that I think gives him his best chance to succeed. Win-win for both sides, though I do believe the rams are taking considerably less risk. I'll be rooting for the eagles as long as Sam is healthy and not playing the Rams"
StLouisRams,3bvi48,frankoftank,5,Thu Jul 2 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"I loved him in 2013. He made quick decisions, he made every throw, he made very few mistakes, and he played behind an O-Line that rolled out the same 5 guys every week for an entire season.  In 2014, he really didn't impress. A lot of that was due to missing Lane and other injuries on the line. I know what kind of QB he can be when he has excellent protection, but it's easy to see how he falls off without it as well. We have a very young, very inexperienced, albeit very large offensive line going into this season. I anticipate an extremely rocky start, followed by a good second half of the season for the run and play action. I don't believe we will be able to give Foles time for his deep ball (great in 2013, poor in 2014), but the main point I have is that Foles is only as good as his protection. If he has a little bit of time, he can be a hell of a QB."
StLouisRams,3bvi48,The_Wayward,4,Thu Jul 2 14:33:50 2015 UTC,"I can agree. I think the offensive line definitely hurt his play, developed that back pedaling tendency. I'm interested to see how he does in a traditional offense at the NFL level. I will be watching a few Rams games this year lol"
StLouisRams,3bvi48,The_Wayward,6,Thu Jul 2 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"My concern is that even with injury issues last year, you still had a top 5 line and he was struggling. Everyone wasn't back until the Sanchez show rolled into town I guess, but it will be night and day for Nick on how good his protection is. I love how quickly he has become a vocal leader on our team though. Something we've never gotten out of Sam was that passion and leadership."
StLouisRams,3bvi48,g00dj0b,5,Thu Jul 2 14:51:00 2015 UTC,"That's something Nick thrives in. VERY vocal guy, but in a very confident HUMBLE way. No question he had a rough year, but remember, guy was 14-4 under chip. He can make the plays to win. When he went down, birds were 5-2 on the way to being 6-2."
StLouisRams,3bvi48,New_DudeToo,5,Thu Jul 2 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"Foles: If the offensive line does their job this year Foles and the receiving corps should break out and do well. St. Louis is a great place for Nick to lead a team to the playoffs, especially with our defense getting even better this offseason. Watching Bradford and the receivers last season in practices as well as the limited preseason games was a lot of fun and got me really excited about 2014 and I have no reason to believe Foles will hamper that excitement for 2015.   Bradford: I loved watching him when he was on the field. First he was in a situation with a terrible team and mediocre receivers, so he couldn't make much happen. Then it switched and we started building our defense and receivers got better but Bradford couldn't stay on his feet. I really want him to succeed, but my honest opinion is he will not get as much playing time as people think. I think he will be injured or will get replaced by another QB after a rough start. Just my $0.02"

StLouisRams,3bvi48,PRE_-CISION-_,3,Thu Jul 2 17:47:54 2015 UTC,"Since the Rams are unabashedly going to run the ball into the line on 1st and 2nd down, with mostly young or rookie offensive linemen, I think we will find out how good he is on a lot of 3rd and 7s."
StLouisRams,3bvi48,Nosgoth,2,Thu Jul 2 19:51:32 2015 UTC,"From what I have seen from his time playing with the Eagles, I really do feel hopeful about his future with the Rams. The only thing I beseech our team to do is protect him. Just for once, I ask the o-line to deliver as they are supposed to do (we had Davis running half of the time last year due to bad blocking). Plus, our receivers need to deliver as well.    The thing is that we can't honestly speak of Foles' performance until see him take a down. But I do hope the team will give him a chance to showcase his abilities."
StLouisRams,3bvi48,bluemandan,2,Thu Jul 2 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"Right now, Jeff Fisher is betting the entire offense on an extremely inexperienced OL group, and I think the performance of that group will be the key factor in how everyone in this offense - including Foles - fares this year.        I'm holding out hope that this trade turns into one of those rare win/win deals; the Eagles get the strong-armed technician that Kelly wants for his offense, the Rams get the guy who can stay on the field and be a leader in the huddle for Fisher's more run-heavy offense. Everyone's happy."

StLouisRams,3btrcb,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:07:28 2015 UTC,"Not surprised for a couple reasons.   We have enough lack of experience that I feel we would've heard some rumblings either while he was on the trading block or during this period that he's been cut. He's more of a pass blocking guard and a bit undersized for the scheme that our coaches seem to desire implementing. Just look at the guys we drafted. Haverstein is big even for a tackle, and Jamon Brown is a large tackle converted to guard. They're both ""maulers"" if you will, and Haverstein comes from a college known for prolific linemen and consistent, bruising running games. Pretty clear that the mold Fish is looking for doesn't fit Mathis quite.   Granted, some veteran presence with proven skill would be nice. But it doesn't bother or surprise me that we didn't go for him and strain our cap with his contract."
StLouisRams,3btrcb,CplPJ,4,Thu Jul 2 02:24:58 2015 UTC,"I thought Mathis was more of a run blocking guard? IIRC he was one of, if not the best in the league at it last year or the year before."
StLouisRams,3btrcb,xKeyNin,3,Thu Jul 2 02:31:31 2015 UTC,IIRC from my Madden 15 franchise he had 99 Run Block and only 85 Pass Block
StLouisRams,3btrcb,KANYE_WEST_SUPERSTAR,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:01:09 2015 UTC,"I was going off of what I've heard from Eagles fans, and based somewhat on his size as well. Maybe he's more of a run blocker, but size wise, Brown and Havenstein both have 1-2 inches and 20-30lbs on him, so I think the FO is headed in the bulkier direction for our line"

StLouisRams,3bnvgm,dah00psta,-8,Tue Jun 30 21:48:55 2015 UTC,St Louis isn't giving the team a stadium either. The EJD is substandard by the terms of the lease. The Riverfront proposal requires another $300M from Kroenke.

StLouisRams,3bnvgm,Popolar,2,Wed Jul 1 19:22:28 2015 UTC,Are you serious? It's widely reported that the Rams are worth 3x in LA that they are in St Louis. That's from just under $1B to almost $3B by just changing zip codes. That doesn't even count the equity in a Kroenke owned stadium in Inglewood ($2B) versus a few hundred million ($300M?) in equity he might get from forcing him to buy into Riverfront.  Plus all the ancillary revenue generated by the development of retail and food services on the Inglewood site.
StLouisRams,3bnvgm,eight26,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:09:44 2015 UTC,I'm not saying LA isn't big. I'm saying St. Louis isn't as small of a market as you imply it is.   Stop getting so worked up and taking things personally.
StLouisRams,3bnvgm,Popolar,2,Wed Jul 1 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"Um ... I was talking about the Rams then you referred to me.  St Louis is literally the lowest valued team in the NFL.  Market size and engagement have a lot to do with that.  I'm sure you and I have had this conversation before. Unless you have facts, data, or something similar to support your assertions, please stop."
StLouisRams,3bnvgm,eight26,0,Wed Jul 1 21:42:42 2015 UTC,"Lol okay. How about the worst record in history over the last decade? Does that play into their value?   Hint: it totally does.   You think that maybe, just maybe the low value of the team has a lot less to do with their market and more to do with their performance? Because St. Louis is actually just larger than Dallas population wise, ranking it in the top 10 largest cities in America. I have told you this before, if you remember my independent city spiel.    Yeah, LA is like the most populated city, but my point still stands. St. Louis is still a bigger city than most other NFL cities. Relocating the team out of St. Louis into LA would improve the teams value, but then the NFL would be flipping the bird to a major market who is actively trying to keep their team."

StLouisRams,3bnvgm,chemicalpoisons,-7,Tue Jun 30 21:41:19 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm thinking of 02 then. He fumbled like an average 5 times a Game and then threw like 47 picks.
StLouisRams,3bnvgm,crackalac,6,Tue Jun 30 21:47:54 2015 UTC,"2002: 8 fumbles and 11 INTs  in 7 games (6 starts).   Revisionist history notwithstanding, people hated Warner in 2002-03. He sucked.

I'd wait a little bit before jumping on this hype train.  But let's assume this happens, and they do drop Carson in favor of Farmers. This would indicate that Carson was never serious, and that they're just using it for leverage. The Raiders need it for leverage against Oakland, and if that fails (which it looks like it will) then they'll need it for leverage against their next target, likely San Antonio. The Chargers don't need leverage against San Diego, since they have no intention of staying there, but instead need leverage against Kroenke. At this point Spanos probably realizes he's going to end up in Inglewood, but he needs some sort of threat to convince Kroenke to give him good lease terms."

If the Bolts and Raiders really get desperate and think Kroenke will win, this is their nuclear option (and frankly, this was always the most badass LA option).

Or, with GS backing the development, would they be happy to just make bank off site management & leasing? - If AEG doesn’t return, how do you transfer Farmers Field from the previous developer (AEG) to a new one the Chargers/Raiders JV would hire to build out the project? Again, this is where the issue arises over who owns the plans for developing the site, and whether any pre-existing interest remains with AEG. - What about the originally-planned extensions to the LA Convention Center; would that massive project get built in conjunction with a Farmers Field stadium?   Angelinos: Would it be fair to say that the Downtown LA site would be the best amongst it, Carson, and Inglewood, without any regard to which team(s) play where? Noting the ancillary developments, including the Staples Center, LA Live, and proximate office space ready to go for NFL West operations, I’d think this looks pretty good as a standalone site, but how would it compare to the other options as a venue? And out of curiosity, could you realistically tailgate?"
StLouisRams,3bpwtp,SoulardSTL,0,Wed Jul 1 17:09:55 2015 UTC,"Downtown makes a whole lot of sense, and from every rendering looks incredible. I'm a huge hoops fan and also attend hockey games at Staples Center, and the whole setup with LA Live is really well done and a lot of fun to attend. Tailgating, unless they made some change, wouldn't be realistic. I would say it was better than Carson, and at least on the level of Inglewood, since Stan basically wants to build his own LA Live there.  Traffic would be a major concern, as well. It's already something of a clusterfuck leaving a game, and I'm pretty sure adding 3-4 times the people probably wouldn't help things. I would assume some massive infrastructure improvements to help with the ingress and egress."
StLouisRams,3bpwtp,Seductive_Santa,2,Wed Jul 1 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some major investments into transportation infrastructure would be necessary for any of the 3 sites, but I'd really buy it for Downtown. Have to say that as much as I love SoCal, the traffic is just an incredible obstacle. Does it help that there are Metro stops nearby? Or would traffic just be one of those things y'all would have to endure no matter what?"
StLouisRams,3bpwtp,ole_school,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:00:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's another advantage, there's a ton of that right there (I've taken the train to a kings game before). Traffic is gonna suck either way."
StLouisRams,3bpwtp,Seductive_Santa,2,Wed Jul 1 20:55:03 2015 UTC,"I believe they addressed the issue of AEG wanting a minority share. It can be done without them using the same financing options the two teams were going to use for Carson.   I just thought it was interesting because there has been zero talk of Farmers field, and now the mayor is saying it was never completely dead. It just goes to show none of us have any idea whats actually going on behind the scenes with LA."
StLouisRams,3bpwtp,SoulardSTL,3,Wed Jul 1 15:27:44 2015 UTC,It looks like the end game with Farmer Field was to get AEG out of the game and remove their demands to be part owner of any team playing there while they controlled the project.

StLouisRams,3bk3jp,ajswdf,3,Mon Jun 29 21:37:19 2015 UTC,From reading this is sounds like the citys Budget Director says the tax from hotels doesn't cover the $6 million a year it is slated to go towards the EJD. And it's also budgeted for 25 years for the EJD and couldn't go to the new stadium. Am I reading that right?
StLouisRams,3bk3jp,ole_school,2,Mon Jun 29 22:12:05 2015 UTC,"My understanding is Nixon says this guy's budget doesn't include the increase in revenue to the Convention Center from this (which is supposedly a relatively significant figure).  I can't imagine the group would be unabashedly lying about the figures.  Especially when they know several people will look into it.  Either way, the conclusion is coming in a couple months."
StLouisRams,3bk3jp,Dave_the_lighting_gu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:50:43 2015 UTC,Yes but they're analyzing the revenue the tax creates from football events. They're trying to establish if the tax generates as much revenue for football purposes as is being claimed.

StLouisRams,3bk3jp,palmermarc,5,Tue Jun 30 11:43:25 2015 UTC,Not sure how you got that opinion reading that article. It sheds a different light on the subject than what you're saying.
StLouisRams,3bk3jp,ole_school,3,Tue Jun 30 13:40:29 2015 UTC,"The $8.5 million raised yearly by the city’s hotel-motel tax, for instance, does not cover debt payments on the Dome, Payne wrote, as the new stadium attorneys have alleged in court. It’s instead pledged to the $17.7 million annual debt payments for the nearly 25-year-old south wing of the city’s convention center.   Now, I know I'm not smart, but isn't that what this is saying?"
StLouisRams,3bk3jp,palmermarc,2,Tue Jun 30 13:56:42 2015 UTC,"But, according to records recently obtained by the Post-Dispatch, it’s unclear tax revenues associated with the Dome’s construction have ever been enough to cover its debt.   And then there's that. So the article is interesting it says it's enough then it's not enough then it's not used for what it's supposed to be used no matter what it covers."
StLouisRams,3bk3jp,ole_school,2,Tue Jun 30 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mis-phrased my original comment. Not only are we not generating enough money to pay for the dome, a large portion of what is being generated is being used to pay for other things."
StLouisRams,3bk3jp,palmermarc,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:37:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. I thought that they'd refinance the bonds to make the payments the same, but the term longer. That way they could use the same funds that are currently going towards the dome to the new bonds. If these hotel taxes aren't currently funding the dome, I don't know why they're wanting to use them for the new bonds.   My best guess is that the plan is to refinance the bonds that they mention here, that were used for the convention center, along with the EJD bonds, and just roll everything into one. This is a pretty optimistic view of the situation, but even then it still makes you wonder why the lawyers weren't better informed."

StLouisRams,3bld3u,SoulardSTL,8,Tue Jun 30 04:50:11 2015 UTC,"You know, I can respect that to a degree. Fake internet points are not worth as much to me as knowing what's going on with my team, and we all are intently curious to what will happen next, whether in STL, LA, Seattle, wherever.   All of us on r/stlouisrams must come to an understanding on how to engage this subject reasonably. Can or should I submit more stories that are in favor of the Saint Louis Rams remaining the Saint Louis Rams? Or would that just fan the flames between us all?  /u/Mister_Dane: Would you be in favor of every Shane Gray and Vincent Bonsignore story being posted, in the understanding that we all want news from potentially both sides of the relocation issue? /u/daedalus000 and the Moderators: Help us understand what may be unduly provocative. Thanks.  Regarding this posting, I have to say that Hancock is an asshole who will say anything to stir up the shit, loving attention he garners whether it is supportive or full animosity. His comments regarding the Rams are, essentially, uneducated, preferring here to spar with his ideological counter rather than discussing the stadium issues. I'm not sure if you're aware of how the news has focused on him in recent times, but he's largely hated throughout Missouri for hard behind-the-scenes isolative pressures levied on his own party's elected leaders, which led to two suicides this past spring. Without any commentary on his views of the Rams, he's a blowhard shitbag. FYI This is coming from a former political consultant that used to work with him. And the story cited here was nothing other than counter-pointing Michael Kelly, not speaking at all of the real reasons behind their statements."

StLouisRams,3bld3u,SoulardSTL,7,Tue Jun 30 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, glad to know you're following my comment postings. Do know that I have been downvoted by STL Rams fans for posting stories that take neutral positions on the issue, such as past Vinny Bonsignore stories on this thread, if that means anything.   Of course, I am fervently in favor of my team remaining my team in my city, allowing me to keep attending games for my team in my city, instead of having to watch them play on TV from 1,500+ miles away should they be taken away. I can respect that you want them proximate to you as well. And, you're damn right that I advocate for keeping my team in my city, as you advocate for their relocation to Inglewood. My comments reflect my intentions, as your comments reflect yours. If you believe such comments go in contravention to what you intend to see with the Rams, i.e. their relocation, then I will not disagree. I'm not in favor of eliminating pro-STL or pro-LA commentary, as these debates can be beneficial if/when mutually respectful. And do know that I do not intend to comment negatively towards any stories just to “troll” or downvote any stories that goes in contravention to what I seek purely for that sake, although I will seek to add context to some stories that could use some, such as sources that may or may not be valid based on their track records of insightfulness (John Hancock, Bill McClellan, etc.).   Where I would appreciate clarity is from the Mods regarding story publishing to the thread. For instance, new Shane Gray or Vinny Bonsignore stories provide news, but many believe these authors write with regional biases and criticize such postings. My interest is relevant news, whether it fits my preferences, yours, or someone else’s. Any such advisement would be appreciated."

Do know that I have been downvoted by STL Rams fans for posting stories that take neutral positions   Ok.. How is that remotely relevant?   I'm not in favor of eliminating pro-STL or pro-LA commentary   And this is again where we differ, I would prefer we only had ""pro-Rams"" commentary. Alas, as you pointed out people here will downvote anything that isn't strictly pro-STL, so that's not possible."
StLouisRams,3bld3u,SoulardSTL,3,Tue Jun 30 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"Well, there goes mutually respectful...   I share the same sentiments of /u/Mister_Date above, when he stated:       I'm here to share articles and have discussions about the my favorite football team. Nothing else.   With this being the off-season, and the very future of our team in question, there will be stories on what will happen to them beyond the field, in fact pertaining to where the field itself is. That's the way it is today. Neither of us want this, and I'd prefer talking about incorporating Gurley into the rushing attack more than having to talk about all these variables. Unfortunately, we have the relocation issue, and this is also news.   Again, I hope there can be mutual respect. That isn't too much to ask. ""I don't give half a crap about you""?

StLouisRams,3b77qb,Sonofsnow,14,Fri Jun 26 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"Take today's breaking news out of the equation...   He has a real valid point. Actions being taken right now by Akon Lighting Africa are incredibly significant, where we have a wealthy rapper who is committing millions of his own dollars towards large-scale economic development in Sub-Saharan Africa. The end goal of his organization is to bring electricity, via solar power, to 600MM+ impoverished Africans. That's incredibly noble, and it certainly is worth recognition. I'd certainly say far more than the kardashian sex change story.   It just points to what in our society we pay attention, and it is screwed up. I don't think it's a commentary on homosexuality, gender issues, trans people, or whatever other -isms can be thrown out there. The difference between Akon and the kardashians is huge, inversely correlated both in societal worth and popular attention, and that is fucked up.   Picked one helluva day to say so, though..."
StLouisRams,3b77qb,SoulardSTL,0,Fri Jun 26 16:22:31 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part, but I feel like it being related to an Trans person specifically plays at least a minor role in all of the complaints.  I just think the media in general couldn't care less about charitable work, so Caitlyn Jenner getting attention isn't really detracting from Akon's work. I'm the first one to bemoan how much attention the Kardashians get, but its worthwhile to have a national discussion on Trans issues in particular since its a very neglected aspect of  LGBTQ discussion."

He's not hating on gay/trans acceptance, he is hating on how it's all over the front page when it effects a small population in the US. Akon is helping over 600 million people. It's a great statement, it's just people are silly and take things the wrong way and run with it way too far."
StLouisRams,3b77qb,alderaan_never4get,3,Fri Jun 26 19:21:39 2015 UTC,"The problem is that he can express his opinion about what Akon is doing without putting marriage equality into the context. The two issues are not related, and attention isn't being taken away from Akon. He can give Akon his time AND also let LGBT individuals have their moment. So to say ""Our society is fucked up"" is a little gauche, wouldn't you say?    he is hating on how it's all over the front page when it effects a small population in the US.   Black people made up a ""small population"" in the US when they were fighting for equality. So are gays, trans, and gender non conforming people. Today signals the end to a long held, institutionalized, hate-fueled discrimination of people just wanting equal rights. Doesn't matter that it only effects a small group of people. It's an injustice that should never have been allowed."

They're two very different issues. To say it today of all days is absolutely disappointing from Robert.    He is saying society is fucked up because all everyone seems to care about is some sex change   Saying it as just ""some sex change"" is glib to the issues trans people are facing. The suicide rates of trans people is sobering and scary. People can downplay Caitlyn as an empty celebrity figurehead if they want, but she brought to the forefront the visibility of the struggle many trans people face every day.   EDIT: This is not to downplay what Akon is doing. There does need to be more attention to what he's doing in Africa.

StLouisRams,3avzop,CrackMamba,19,Tue Jun 23 23:09:42 2015 UTC,"Personally I think it will be Foles. Not because I think he's going to stuff the stat sheet, but because he WILL add a consistent level of play that we have not seen at the QB position in a long time. Hand the ball off, spread it around, hit a deep pass off of play action, and don't turn the ball over; he will manage the game and put us in a spot to win."
StLouisRams,3avzop,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:13:48 2015 UTC,"One of the receivers (Quick) might break out. That'd be a biggie for the Rams. But you're right, the reliability factor could make it a lock for Foles."
StLouisRams,3avzop,cardsfan1343,10,Sat Jul 18 16:14:53 2015 UTC,"I want to pick Brian Quick. But I think if any receiver is in contention to be our offensive MVP and gets 1,000 yards, it will mean Foles performs as we all hope he will and then you've got to give it to him. We have 4 receivers (Bailey, Britt, Austin, and Quick) and Jared Cook who are very capable, and I expect the ball to be spread around quite a bit. Thus, if one does well, 3 or 4 of those guys will also do pretty well and that will mean Foles had a great season and will be the team's offensive MVP. Yet, I see Quick as the guy to lead the team in receptions and yards.  Prediction: Foles wins offensive MVP, Quick emerges as our go-to receiver."
StLouisRams,3avzop,alderaan_never4get,7,Wed Jun 24 00:57:46 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna say Tavon Austin. I think he'll break out this year. His value comes with his all-purpose yards. I think he can break out as an elite return man especially if our special teams is as good as they were last year. I predict 800+ yards receiving, 200+ rushing yards, 800+ yards returning, with 11 total TDs. What makes me so sure? Nothing at all. This is just wishful thinking, but I do think it's certainly possible."

StLouisRams,3avzop,frankoftank,5,Thu Jun 25 03:19:54 2015 UTC,"I don't see either Gurley nor mason being worthy of MVP if they are splitting carries. Also can't see any of our receivers getting it if Foles spreads the ball around like he usually does. So I'm going to pick Rodger Saffold.  He demonstrated his leadership last year and will be the only veteran on the starting line if current projections hold true. He got surgery in the off season to fix the tendons in his shoulder so he won't have to deal with a weak shoulder all year (and was still our best lineman).  I think if his health holds up he'll return to form like the end of 2013 when he was a dominant guard, and will provide veteran leadership to the entire o line, leading to improvement for the offense and the entire team.  MVP baby."

StLouisRams,3avzop,RamsWillFly,3,Wed Jun 24 15:26:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going with Gurley. I know people think he will split with Mason but once he's ready I think he will get more carries by far. I think we can say the Rams staff isn't afraid to switch around the RB position and let a player shine in the spotlight once they decide who they think is a better fit. he was drafted 10th overall for a reason, even with an injury. This kid is going to be a beast.  I haven't been paying much attention to the injury so that's assuming he comes back after a few games."

StLouisRams,3avzop,Yji,2,Wed Jun 24 20:17:17 2015 UTC,"Mason is a super interesting pick with Gurley around. I didn't watch the video though, so I have no idea on his reasoning."
StLouisRams,3avzop,To3z,3,Wed Jun 24 00:00:52 2015 UTC,I'm assuming it's because he thinks Mason will have plenty of time to shine before Gurley gets playing time. I'm gonna go with Foles just because if we have a winning season he'll be seen as the reason.
StLouisRams,3avzop,One_Half_Hamster,2,Wed Jun 24 01:34:30 2015 UTC,"I can easily see it being Tre Mason.  We are going to be a very heavy run team and Gurley won't be ready for a bit.  Even if Gurley comes in and just wrecks things, it is hard for me to see us taking the risk of making him a three down back right away, giving Mason more carries for the better part of the season.  I also believe that out of all of our receivers this year, Britt is going to be the one that shows he can be an offensive leader.  I don't know about Foles being an MVP, but I feel that he will be a more than adequate game manager and that is what we need from him."

StLouisRams,3ar4yj,ole_school,3,Tue Jun 23 14:44:35 2015 UTC,"You can do it pretty cheap. Tickets on Stub are around $15-20. For parking you can go to a bar in Soulard and take a free shuttle. (Just buy a beer and ask for a shuttle ticket), that will cost around $5. Traffic isn't terrible if you take a shuttle from Soulard. If it gets bad just get out and walk.The shuttle should be able to get you to at least 4 blocks from the stadium before you hit traffic. I like to get to the game a little early. See the introductions and the teams warming up. I shoot for 30-45 minutes before kickoff. For food around the stadium I like Bobby's Place. But most places on Washington Ave are good. If you do go to Soulard and take the shuttle I like Trumans Place, Molly's, or Johnny's as places to go before sporting events."

If you look hard you can find tickets for pretty cheap. Hope this helps."

StLouisRams,3apfv5,axle69,3,Mon Jun 22 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"Mason has nothing to worry about so long as he continues to improve. I think both Fisher and the rest of the league believe Tre Mason can be a great starter.   If Mason lives up to his potential and Gurley does the same, I'm sure Mason will find another team and the Rams will get a crap load of picks for him.  Or we could just stick with two great RBs and run everyone over.   Either way, on a ground and pound Fisher team, there is more than enough room for Mason to gain recognition."

StLouisRams,3aof5e,axle69,4,Mon Jun 22 05:05:48 2015 UTC,"What makes Davis is that he seems young, is a better back up than Weeden, and fairly expendable to you guys. I'm not sure Keenum holds any trade value, as he would just be cut if Davis isn't traded."
StLouisRams,3aof5e,axle69,9,Mon Jun 22 05:09:00 2015 UTC,I honestly believe that if Davis figures out how to handle himself in the pocket a bit better he'd be a viable starter. It keeps me hesitant in wanting to give him up for anything when we haven't seen Foles play yet.
StLouisRams,3aof5e,CrackMamba,2,Mon Jun 22 05:14:25 2015 UTC,"That's why I want him :P I feel like he could go for a sixth round pick, maybe a fifth, and could be a real steal."
StLouisRams,3aof5e,ShaolinMaster,4,Mon Jun 22 05:16:24 2015 UTC,"In reality, Davis figures to be the odd man out on the roster at this point. Foles is the incumbent starter, we traded a 7th round pick this year for Keenum, a QB who spent a large portion of last season on our practice squad, and used a 3rd round pick on Mannion. Which makes me believe the staff has moved on from Davis completely.   I was on the Davis bandwagon last year and he provided the fans with a few exciting games filled with tough and gritty play, but he could not hold it together. Whether or not he showed enough to warrant trade interest or not will be seen as we approach the season, but the way the roster sits now he is more than expendable."
StLouisRams,3aof5e,big_fig,2,Mon Jun 22 05:21:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like Davis could be a good game manager, but will need to count on somebody else to make clutch plays. That doesn't mean he won't play ""good"", but he needs another player to go above and beyond when it truly counts (like Dez or Jason Witten for us), and I didn't really see that in any skill players on your offense."
StLouisRams,3aof5e,RickSmith123,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:24:09 2015 UTC,I think the next step is to trade Keenum back to the Texans for a 6th rounder.

StLouisRams,3amt65,BrawndoTTM,17,Sun Jun 21 19:39:02 2015 UTC,The better question is would I want him to come back and play OG.  And the answer to that is no.
StLouisRams,3amt65,CaptAmerica42,8,Sun Jun 21 19:57:28 2015 UTC,"He's made of glass but elite when healthy, the Saffold special. Maybe he'll come into his own as OG just like Saffold did."
StLouisRams,3amt65,CaptAmerica42,4,Sun Jun 21 20:01:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  But on the flip side, a guy who can play and contribute is better than a guy who can't that's being paid to sit on the sidelines.  Id rather trust Boudreau to mold a rookie"
StLouisRams,3amt65,ole_school,4,Sun Jun 21 20:07:29 2015 UTC,Just say no to 30+ year old linemen with injury problems.
StLouisRams,3amt65,dah00psta,4,Sun Jun 21 20:14:00 2015 UTC,"Our rookie Olineman are the teams' future, which is now - no sense in halting their development to pick a lineman that in all likelihood will not stay healthy for the season."
StLouisRams,3amt65,jrose6717,3,Sun Jun 21 21:56:33 2015 UTC,Yeah but having vet leadership couldn't hurt their development. Remember g rob and Orlando pace both didn't start immediately.

StLouisRams,3amt65,RamsWillFly,2,Tue Jun 23 16:32:56 2015 UTC,is he just going to retire?
StLouisRams,3amt65,mlasn,3,Sun Jun 21 22:29:22 2015 UTC,I think he will probably generate interest closer to the season. A team will either see a hole or have an injury and go after him.
StLouisRams,3ambif,ContrastingWords,8,Sun Jun 21 17:03:25 2015 UTC,All we've heard so far are good things but each of us needs to decide for ourselves how much of that is the usual positive spin from a coach and how much is reality.  Personally I think it's way too early to tell how a rookie offensive lineman is doing after only a few OTAs.  A better assessment can be made once they've got the pads on and are going full speed.
StLouisRams,3ambif,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:28:21 2015 UTC,Not even then. Even through most of Pre season they will still be getting their feet under them. Not until week 2 or 3 maybe will they really be showing what their career might be like.
StLouisRams,3ambif,NewBroPewPew,4,Mon Jun 22 16:44:51 2015 UTC,Hey as long as they are practicing against our D-line They should be coming along fine =D

StLouisRams,3ambif,axle69,3,Sun Jun 21 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"Considering last season we were reading about how Robinson was having trouble with the playbook and all of that (which to me was a buncha bullshit -- he's a rookie in a new offensive scheme, it'll take fucking time)...the fact we're hearing nothing is probably a positive.  Or a negative. Who knows. We'll see in pre-season"
StLouisRams,3ambif,JKaye57,3,Sun Jun 21 18:45:55 2015 UTC,Especially when Fisher last year had him learning 2 positions at once as a rookie.
StLouisRams,3ambif,ole_school,2,Sun Jun 21 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"No news is good news, as far as I'm concerned. Fisher seems happy with their progress in the few pressers I've watched"

StLouisRams,3akjgv,frankoftank,5,Sun Jun 21 10:17:17 2015 UTC,That's seems to be what everyone on the defense is saying. Can't wait to see how it results on the field.
StLouisRams,3akjgv,JKaye57,6,Sun Jun 21 07:56:16 2015 UTC,Kinda makes me wonder just how complicated the Williams defense was at the start of last season. Either way. I'm pumped to see everyone getting on track.  EDIT: Williams doesn't coach offense.
StLouisRams,3akjgv,dah00psta,3,Sun Jun 21 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"I love the way Joyner plays. For a smaller guy, he hits with authority. I can't wait to see him elevate his pro game to be more of a play-maker like he was in college."

CB1: Gaines  CB2: Jenkins  Nickle:  Joyner  Dime pacakge: Johnson will be the 4th corner, lining up on the outside, on Dime packages, and Gaines moving into the dime position."
StLouisRams,3akjgv,RickSmith123,3,Tue Jun 23 16:42:00 2015 UTC,I think that is a damn good group. Toss in our three solid safeties and we got a great secondary!
StLouisRams,3akjgv,Bond_007x,2,Tue Jun 23 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, damn solid group.  I really like Jenkins and Gaines as our top 2 CBs.  Hopefully Joyner becomes a very good nickle back.  The safeties are also pretty solid.  I'm looking for T.J. McDonald to really jump into top tier status, at least top 10 in the league.  While McCloud has progressed every year, let's see if he get even better this year.  I like Barron as that extra DB on the field, but not in a back safety role.  Keep him near the line of scrimmage.     With that said, the secondary is definitely underrated a little bit.  I'd classify them as the 3rd best unit on Defense, behind the LBs (2nd) and the D-Line (1st)  I truly believe we could have easily a top 5 Defense, if not THE best Defense in the league."

StLouisRams,3ajwlc,DabDastic,9,Sat Jun 20 23:35:10 2015 UTC,I'll believe it when I see it with Tavon. At this rate of be surprised to even see the Rams resign him after his rookie contract. I would love to see him break out and show why he was a top 10 pick though!
StLouisRams,3ajwlc,bretris,4,Sun Jun 21 00:15:01 2015 UTC,He's worth it for kick off / punt returns alone. Although it would be nice to have the other stuff too.
StLouisRams,3ajwlc,DabDastic,6,Sun Jun 21 01:37:35 2015 UTC,True I always forget how good of a punt returner he is because of all the call backs but still a top 10 pick needs to do more then return kicks
StLouisRams,3ajwlc,Bskrilla,3,Sun Jun 21 01:54:37 2015 UTC,"I think he was under utilized.  I'm the token guy who actually doesn't think Shotty was terrible, but I do think he underutilized Tavon."
StLouisRams,3ajwlc,bleedblue89,2,Sun Jun 21 01:58:48 2015 UTC,His speed is unreal... We haven't had that in forever and he just blows past punt return teams
StLouisRams,3ajwlc,Bskrilla,6,Sun Jun 21 16:41:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sippin.  It's his 3rd year.  Dude was always able to get by on his athleticism before the pros.  Now after a couple years I think he'll have the experience, that you need in the NFL, to go along with that raw skill and will really start to shine.    I still think that he's worth a roster spot for his return skills and occasional big play threat alone.    I will say that if he doesn't start to contribute more on offense they should stick him on KR too though."

StLouisRams,3ajwlc,BilllyMayes,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:59:18 2015 UTC,"The No. 8 overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft has been nothing short of a bust through two seasons   REALLY? Offensive production has been down, I give them that. However, take into consideration the piss poor offensive coordinator and a revolving door of QB's of differing qualities and playstyles it's no wonder his offensive production has been low.  I mean for fuck sake, we faked the Seattle special teams based partly on the explosiveness and danger of Tavon (granted, they messed up coverage through habit but still). As a punt returner, I would be willing to put him up with Hester from what I've seen. Quick, explosive, and an eye for openings. I'm assuming we don't call Hester a bust because he doesn't produce a lot on offense?  Fuck this guy. Fuck him hard and long. Tavon IS NOT a bust, we WILL resign him. Giving him a new QB might be tough at the beginning, but if we get the same quarterback for the season (not to mention Foles comes from a system that very much fits Tavon's skillset) he will look a lot better this season. Mark my words."
StLouisRams,3ajwlc,Kuro007,4,Sun Jun 21 02:46:59 2015 UTC,"A WIDE RECEIVER that we drafted in the top ten doesnt have 1000 receiving yards over two seasons. Was the OC and Qbing bad? Yes. That doesnt change the fact thats also a bad Wide receiver. Guys like Quick were actually showing improvement (with the same oc and backup qb) while tavon hasnt shown any.  Is he explosive on KRs and PRs? Yes, but you dont trade up for a punt returner. As A WR tavon austin as of right now is a bust. As a complete player, he hasnt had the impact on the team I expect a top ten player to make. Had we just drafted Hopkins and a linemen with that 2nd, we would be in a much better place.  He can improve and grow as of player. I hope he does. But as of right now he isnt worth what we gave up. Of course Wrs dont always come out the gate fast so I wouldnt completely panic unless he shows 0 improvement this year as a WR."
StLouisRams,3ajwlc,The_Fad,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:04:40 2015 UTC,"Does anyone have stats on how many times Tavon actually touched the ball in a WR capacity? I feel like I never saw his never even on incompletes last year which, if that is the case, speaks a lot to how he's been consistently underutilized."
StLouisRams,3aief9,JKaye57,5,Sat Jun 20 14:07:03 2015 UTC,"People like to shit on him but he's not a bad player, he's prime has passed but he's still serviceable and could make a roster. He's also an intelligent guy and a good locker room guy."
StLouisRams,3aief9,out_of_time,2,Sat Jun 20 16:38:48 2015 UTC,Thanks! I honestly knew nothing about him and couldn't find much.

StLouisRams,3aief9,Fridge-Largemeat,3,Sat Jun 20 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly. I think I'd be okay with this. Ross is a two time Super Bowl winner and could be a veteran presence that we really do need in our secondary. Bringing him in as a Dime back could be good for the team -- Jenkins, Tru, Gaines, Ross. Roberson could be given a bit more time to develop since it does seem like Fish likes him.   Ross could be good for our youngsters."
StLouisRams,3aief9,Vanscoten,3,Sat Jun 20 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I like our current setup.   Janoris, Tru, EJ, Joyner, Brandon McGee, and Roberson."
StLouisRams,3aief9,Vanscoten,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:29:03 2015 UTC,"McGee is pretty terrible in my opinion. Joyner...I have no clue exactly what his role on the team is. If he'll be used as a corner, or a safety, or whatever. But I think he'll be much better than he was last season. The question is what is his role?"
StLouisRams,3aief9,Vanscoten,3,Sat Jun 20 18:33:45 2015 UTC,"If all goes as planned, McGee will just be a decent 5th string, and special team player. Joyner had some pretty good plays last year when he was in on the snap. Gaines just had an unbelievable rookie season while filling in for Tru and took time from Joyner. Joyner can play safety and nickel, so one of those, probably in with package plays."
StLouisRams,3aief9,undead_tortoise,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:38:32 2015 UTC,"I'd almost prefer Roberson to be the decent 5th string. I feel like he has more potential than McGee. I do like our secondary. I just don't think it would be the worst idea to bring someone on the team who has won something before. We have so much youth and skill but having a veteran presence in the secondary may be good. It may also be good to have someone for Jenkins to talk to...since for all of his talking and all of his skill, he can at times be more focused on the big play and take unnecessary risks. And it hurts."
StLouisRams,3agqvk,CrackMamba,6,Sat Jun 20 00:55:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, I had forgotten about this guy.  He was actually a pretty good blitzing force IIRC, similar to Mark Barron."
StLouisRams,3agqvk,daedalus000,4,Sat Jun 20 01:10:58 2015 UTC,Yeah he had a couple of solid seasons with the Rams. And overall he quietly had himself a great career; even made it to a pro bowl before coming to the Lou.

StLouisRams,3acqhd,ajswdf,4,Fri Jun 19 01:22:01 2015 UTC,"This is an incredibly weak lawsuit. Its impetus is that plaintiff believes there is a conspiracy to fund the current RSA work with City monies, so they expect to receive every document in this ongoing business development, including private negotiations founded in proprietary business secrets, to validate their conspiracy. And as the Blitz attorney pointed out: the documents were previously denied public release because of current activities that do not classify these as ""sunshine law"" available, and this denial doesn't negate the non-applicability of ""sunshine law"" in the present case.   I don't see a legal argument here, but instead a potentially log-jamming frivolous lawsuit.   What grounds would the RSA release these documents to Mott-Oxford? Some procedural loophole she's exploiting? Serious question here. If you're an attorney or work in civic government enough to reasonably answer this via statute, please respond. Thanks  Meanwhile, know that Mott-Oxford is a pure Social Justice Warrior, no doubt."
StLouisRams,3acqhd,SoulardSTL,3,Fri Jun 19 18:58:18 2015 UTC,"IANAL, but it seems like this would be exempted from the sunshine laws because of the lawsuit, and it may hurt their negotiation position when dealing with the land owners they're buying from, and even against the Rams or another NFL team.   To me, the most important question about this lawsuit is whether or not a ruling against the RSA would prevent them from moving forward on the stadium. If so even a frivilous lawsuit could cause problems. However, I don't think this is the case. I have the actual petition, and the closest it comes to preventing a stadium is asking the judge to ""impose a civil penalty"".  Overall probably not a big deal, even if the RSA somehow loses. I honestly wouldn't have posted it if I had seen the petition last night."
StLouisRams,3acqhd,SoulardSTL,0,Fri Jun 19 19:14:23 2015 UTC,"Not attorney, but did attend law school (no acronym for that)... The court that's overseeing the Cole County suit could impose more strict rules for documents utilized in the proceedings, including any and all discovery documents that, should they be made public, would constitute a breach of business secrets and confidentiality. But quite honestly, we don't know exactly what documents are being used in this action, as to whether or not current documents ascribing present-day funding and sourcing of revenues are included in this discovery.   Let's assume they are to continue the conversation... Mott-Oxford could claim she would like to see these documents, and I haven't read a copy of the filing, but I have yet to see a valid reasoning for her justified receipt and/or review of these documents. She essentially claims she wants to confirm or negate her conspiracy theory that RSA monies aren't spent on RSA activities, but that they're really City monies (and that's a huge reach), but it's been declared unreasonable to provide these confidential documents to her at this time. She's sued to see them, but I don't see any real procedural reasoning that would justify the courts making these documents available for her review. Anyway, I would seriously believe the supposed misappropriation of public monies claimed herein, especially under false pretenses across the representative entities' legal authorities, would be investigated by the State Auditor and, if there is indeed misappropriation, the FBI. Not fucking Jeanette Mott-Oxford.  Agree that this could be, and likely is, a delaying action by a SJW in an attempt to delay in hopes of derailing."

I'm not anticipating a deep playoff run or anything but I wouldn't be surprised if we made a wildcard slot.  It all really depends on our offensive line. Three rookie starters, no matter how talented, is cause for concern. We have one of the best offensive line coaches in the game so that eases my concerns slightly but the whole season is going to come down to that.  Most of our other position groups I feel pretty comfortable with. Hopefully Nick Foles comes to be at least a shadow of his 2013 self. If he does that I would feel as good about our offense than ever."

StLouisRams,3aceky,cshay33,3,Fri Jun 19 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"We sincerely apologize for killing your quarterbacks last season, I would've rather had the Cards be divisional champs than the seahawks again..."
StLouisRams,3aceky,BrawndoTTM,2,Fri Jun 19 16:42:23 2015 UTC,I don't hold a grudge. I don't think there were any dirty hits. For Palmer his ACL was an older cadaver ACL replacement and these are an older surgery style and just have a time limit... it snapped on a no-contact play... it was just time. I think your guys roughed up Drew Stanton pretty good but all clean hits IIRC. I think one drew a late hit call... but IMO no fault to your DB. Your front 7 is so nasty they don't have to play dirty to break people! And yeah... ask them to beat up the Seahawks this year. :)
StLouisRams,3aceky,Daytwa313,6,Fri Jun 19 20:05:43 2015 UTC,I'd say 9-7 is realistic.
StLouisRams,3aceky,slopcounts,5,Fri Jun 19 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"Rams fan here in Peoria,  AZ.  The offensive line is the biggest question no doubt. Tre Mason,  Todd Gurley,  and Nick foles should help cover that up very nicely  though.    We are coming for you!  You'll get a nice little preview when we play the Hawks in the Lou week 1"
StLouisRams,3aceky,JustinJacksonsRunner,2,Fri Jun 19 01:41:31 2015 UTC,"Really this year could be anywhere from 5-11 to 12-4.  If the line gels and our running game comes full force, our passing should follow.  Our defense should carry us in some games."

Nothing against Barnes, he was a serviceable center when Wells went down, but I feel like we already know what we have in Barnes, a decent backup. Jones is one of the smartest guys on the team and one of the most highly decorated linemen to come out of college ball. Rhaney has the zone blocking chops and athleticism to succeed in a zone blocking scheme. We don't know what we have in these two guys and I'd love to find out."
StLouisRams,3aa8rh,frankoftank,3,Thu Jun 18 15:28:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm pulling for Jones in this competition. I was excited when we drafted him and I think if given the chance and if he can stay healthy, he could make an impact."
StLouisRams,3aa8rh,JKaye57,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:02:33 2015 UTC,Is it more likely that Jones moves over to RG?  That was his original position at Bama.  He was probably better suited for guard than Center.  That would only have us starting one rookie on the line - Probably Havenstein at RT.  Any reports of these guys shuffling during OTAs?
StLouisRams,3aa8rh,bbbws,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:22:56 2015 UTC,The only reports I've heard during OTAs is Jamon Brown getting first team reps at guards and the three man rotation at center. I think they like the power that brown brings at G. Jones is really smart so as long as he can handle it physically you know he'll have no problem with the mental side of it.

StLouisRams,3a5bvw,CyanRam,2,Wed Jun 17 12:41:48 2015 UTC,"I have always wondered why more teams in College and Pro level didn't implement this into D-line and O-line training. A lot martial arts is about using your opponents weight against them and knock them off balance. You also learn how to maintain your center of gravity and balance when being hit or grabbed. If used properly you could probably have smaller linemen, but using they speed and strength in a more effective way."

StLouisRams,3a626h,Vanscoten,9,Wed Jun 17 15:00:43 2015 UTC,I'd breathe a sigh of relief if we managed to snag Mathis though.

StLouisRams,3a3evw,SCRx,11,Tue Jun 16 22:34:10 2015 UTC,"This is huge. Let's all recognize that, whether we want the Rams in LA or STL, the final decision will be answered in large part by what happens in SD. Let's respectfully try to focus here on SD more than our ongoing LA/STL feud, please...   Today was the third meeting between the SD Commission and the Chargers. And while within the past hour SD Mayor Faulconer had a press conference where he said things were largely positive for SD keeping the Chargers, the team turns around and releases its statement found in the article. Basically, the Chargers say that it will be impossible to build in the established framework because of preexisting CA environmental laws (CEQA). Rather than dragging things on, it looks like they're pulling the cord and letting it die.   What are the options now in San Diego? 1. Push for the NFL to not vote on relocation until after 2016, which is very unlikely. 2. Restart negotiations on a new Chargers stadium in Downtown SD, part of a convention center expansion, on a very expedited timeline. While this won't have the environmental complications, it'll be extremely difficult if not wholly impossible. 3. Get the State of California to change its laws so construction can take place in Mission Valley. Basically, impossible.   Quid pro quo is that the Chargers are ready to relocate.   We must all now look to what happens in Oakland, where their third-party stadium guy will present his options to OAK and the Raiders by 6/21 (he's looking for $500MM from the private sector). If neither the Chargers nor the Raiders can get their home markets together, that'll greatly increase the impetus behind Carson. And if Carson is chosen, then Inglewood won't be."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,SoulardSTL,7,Tue Jun 16 23:12:33 2015 UTC,"Even if they could get a vote by then, it'd be too late. They're breaking ground in Inglewood in December, so the Chargers have to know what they're doing by then. I think the mayor has known since the beginning that the vote won't happen, and that he'll have to fund it without one if he wants to get it done. Now he can go to the public and say ""we tried to get a vote, but we ran out of time"".   I'm not as familiar with the San Diego situation as I am with St. Louis, but the biggest question is if they'll face lawsuits similar to the ones in St. Louis if they go that route. If not, there's still a chance the Chargers stay in San Diego."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,ajswdf,3,Tue Jun 16 23:13:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a legal mess out there. The Chargers' fear has been that CA Environmental laws would lead to years of lawsuits and a nebulous timeline that could leave them stuck in Qualcomm for the long term after years of delays and lawsuits. By far, those lawsuits look far worse than those currently underway in STL/MO.   It really seems like SD Mayor Faulkoner has been covering his ass politically this whole time, almost as if he's been more interested in keeping the muck off his political imaging than he's been in doing what'd be necessary in keeping the Chargers there. They should've focused on Downtown SD and building out the convention center this whole time instead of the quagmire (especially under the pavement) in Mission Valley.   Sucks for Chargers fans. I really do feel bad for them. But after 15 years, it looks like the team's finally done negotiating with SD City Hall, unless City Hall can pull off the impossible."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,SoulardSTL,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:19:29 2015 UTC,"From the get-go chargers claimed they were site neutral. Qualcomm fixed the oil plume under the stadium years ago, the company that did it uses it as their poster child of success. Fabiani is a piece of shit mouthpiece that serves as a shield to keep mud off of dean spanos. Downtown has been a dead end for years until very recently, mainly due to opposition from hoteliers and comicon. Plus there would be a zoning change that would have to be voted on. The mission valley site would be the fastest and most efficient at this point, it's already zoned for a stadium. From all accounts, it would seem like the chargers have been working in secret for well over a year on the move without informing the city. They were simply biding time and milking the deal they had with the city until a team threatened to move to LA. Kroenke has just moved way faster than they anticipated, so now they're scrambling to get something in place.  My personal thoughts on the matter are that Kroenke may build a stadium and either move the Rams, or trade them to Davis or Spanos for their respective team and move that one into Inglewood. Whichever team is left will probably move in with them. At the end of the day, two teams are likely going to be in Inglewood.  God I hate LA, why do they have to have two teams of every fucking sport."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,Pittyswains,0,Mon Jun 22 06:32:18 2015 UTC,"Man, I feel for you guys.   Saint Louis and San Diego are brethren in all this, both cities fighting to keep what is respectfully our own from being taken by the owners to LA. It sucks that what may be good for one of us is only at the deep cost of the other. I know that there are many in LA sniping at STL over seizing the Rams, and I bet there are plenty doing that with the Chargers. In the end, know that STL feels full empathy for SD, as we’ve been through owners taking our old team to AZ and our current POS owner who first took from LA to STL now threatening taking them again from STL to LA.   As an outsider, those environmental issues sure look like something people would sue over. In STL, our project doesn’t even have those issues at play, and there are already 3 lawsuits going on currently over our proposed North Riverfront Stadium. That’s one of the reasons why I was thinking the Downtown option in SD could be a better play for you guys to resurrect. Plus, the renderings are really fucking cool, could be a great addition to your city’s really enjoyable Downtown.   We’re not scheduled to play this year, but I look forward to the day when SAINT LOUIS plays SAN DIEGO."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,SoulardSTL,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, feeling's mutual. I want all our cities to keep their teams, even oakland. The sad thing is, it's not the first time LA has taken an SD team (clippers), and yet people are dumbfounded when they hear a lot of san diegans hate LA. Chargers only stayed one year in LA after being founded there before moving to SD.  The reason why the mission valley site is further along is that all they would need to do is renew the environmental impact and then approve funding. The site itself has already had been reviewed and zoned for a stadium. Whereas downtown would need to create a new environmental impact report, zone the site, approve the funding for it and then maybe another vote to buy the land from the water department. It would also need to be a 2/3 vote as opposed to a simple majority at the Qualcomm site. Chargers have been pushing for downtown for over a decade because they know it's impossible to get.  I haven't seen any lawsuits pop up against the city currently, they're mostly trying to find a way to fund everything. The only thing I've seen is someone threatening to sue the chargers for leaving, haha."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,Pittyswains,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:00:46 2015 UTC,"I know that there are many in LA sniping at STL over seizing the Rams, and I bet there are plenty doing that with the Chargers. In the end, know that STL feels full empathy for SD   I love your honesty.   You're a good man."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,DeniseDeNephew,0,Tue Jun 23 04:44:23 2015 UTC,Very kind. Thank you
StLouisRams,3a3evw,SoulardSTL,-1,Tue Jun 23 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"CSAG's plan from the beginning wasn't about the stadium, it was about the funding. SO the question isn't if they can get the stadium plan finalized in time. The question is if they can get the funding finalized, and if the NFL and the Chargers will accept it.  In my mind, the Chargers will probably join the Rams in Inglewood, with the Raiders moving to St. Louis if that funding gets past the lawsuits. If not, they'll get a large chunk of the relocation fee to fund a stadium in Oakland or they'll go to San Antonio."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,ajswdf,2,Tue Jun 16 23:30:38 2015 UTC,"with the Raiders moving to St. Louis   This really just makes no sense to me. I don't see STL supporting the third team here in 25 years. Either the Rams stay, with or without Kroenke owning them, or STL no longer has an NFL team."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,Kaos047,-5,Wed Jun 17 03:09:30 2015 UTC,"When you read the tea leaves, the Raiders to St. Louis seems the most likely scenario if the stadium gets funded.   Mark Davis seems to prefer Oakland, but that doesn't seem possible with the mayor saying they'll get no public money. Besides Oakland, Davis doesn't seem to care where he goes as long as he gets a stadium. Every indication is that Kroenke will build his stadium in Inglewood no matter what. He hasn't even pretended that he's trying to work out a deal with St. Louis. Even Nixon and Peacock have said publicly that Kroenke is determined to move to LA. They've promoted St. Louis as an NFL city, not a Rams city. Nixon has spoken at length with Goodell, and Goodell is complementary of his efforts. Nixon also speaks highly of his conversations with Goodell. When you compare the stadium proposals, Inglewood is superior to Carson from the NFL's perspective.  Whether the Chargers move to LA or not, they don't want 3 teams in Southern California, and all the indications are the NFL will honor their wish.   Add those all together, and the conclusion is that Kroenke will move the Rams to Inglewood, so the NFL gets the LA stadium they've been waiting for for 20 years. No matter what the Chargers do, they won't allow the Raiders to join Kroenke in LA. However, with a new stadium in St. Louis, the NFL will pressure Davis to move there, and Davis will do it because he doesn't really care if he doesn't get Oakland.   This will allow the NFL to avoid the awkward situation of letting a team move despite a reasonable stadium proposal, which would really hurt them when trying to get other cities in the future to cough up money for new stadiums.  Goodell has probably promised Nixon an NFL team if he gets the funding approved. But the NFL isn't expanding any time soon, and the only team that has any chance of moving in the next 5 years is the Raiders.  If this doesn't happen, the NFL will either have to go with the sub par Carson stadium and making Kroenke unhappy (maybe inviting a very dangerous anti-trust lawsuit) or make themselves look bad by letting the Rams move despite St. Louis and Missouri giving them a stadium."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,ajswdf,6,Wed Jun 17 03:30:08 2015 UTC,"Besides Oakland, Davis doesn't seem to care where he goes as long as he gets a stadium.   I don't think that's the case though. It's either LA or stay in Oakland for them. He has repeatedly said he has no interest in moving to St. Louis, even for a new stadium.."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,DiscoJer,0,Wed Jun 17 08:04:05 2015 UTC,"They can also share Levi's with the Niners.  The Bay Area is a huge, wealthy market."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,DeniseDeNephew,2,Wed Jun 17 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"I've heard Davis say repeatedly that he won't go into either Saint Louis or Santa Clara, that neither markets match with the Raiders brand. And Raiders-49ers Hate is a very real thing...  Check out this interview of Mark Davis by John Clayton at ESPN. Lots of good stuff here."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,SoulardSTL,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:49:45 2015 UTC,"If Davis is willing to share a stadium with the Chargers to get a piece of the LA market then I think he'd be willing to share a stadium with the Niners to split the Bay Area market (which he is already doing).   I don't believe for a minute that moving to the south bay would alienate Raiders fans.  Most would have a shorter drive to games.    If they decide to sell PSLs for the Raiders games none of it needs to go to the cost of building the already-built stadium, and the wealthy Bay Area can generate a lot of PSL revenue.  Moving to Levi's also presents zero relocation fees, no moving, they can use the same practice facilities and offices.  The only thing that changes are the players' and fans' commutes.  They wouldn't even need to be permanent residents in case Oakland or some other Bay Area city decides to spend tax money on a stadium.  It might seem unlikely but it seems much more likely to me than the various scenarios involving Kroenke selling/trading the team or Davis selling his family's legacy so the Raiders can be rebranded in another city.  I think Levi's is a legitimate option for them and about as easy a transition as possible."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,DeniseDeNephew,0,Wed Jun 17 18:48:12 2015 UTC,"But, every Raiders fan I know hates the 49ers, and vice versa. They fight for the allegiances of every fan in Northern California, and the hate is visceral.   Davis has repeatedly said he would not move his team into Santa Clara as the second-go tenant. He especially noted that Santa Clara is designed specifically around being home to the 49ers, such as the seats all consisting of 49ers colors, and that they would not be redecorated to reflect that the Raiders play there as well. Plus, Santa Clara is a good hour's drive from Alameda, not including traffic. It's a stadium built around the Silicon Valley culture, not the Raiders' target audience. Oh, and the ownership don't really like each other, which could be a big deal if we're talking partnerships.   Q: Since the Chargers & Raiders are already in a 50/50 Joint Venture partnership, why would they break up just to fit another owner's game plan for LA? By either party breaking the JV, there would be serious exposure to massive lawsuits and explicit violations of preexisting mutual agreements. Very risky."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,SoulardSTL,0,Wed Jun 17 20:40:06 2015 UTC,Goodell has probably promised Nixon an NFL team if he gets the funding approved.   Source?

Nixon has spoken highly of his discussions with Goodell, and Goodell has spoken highly of the plan. The NFL doesn't want to let a city lose their team without a replacement if they were willing to build a new stadium. No other cities are in line after LA gets theirs (other than maybe San Antonio).   Why wouldn't Goodell promise it? It just makes sense."
StLouisRams,3a3evw,ajswdf,2,Wed Jun 17 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"I forgot where I read this but apparently, the only way one team could be in L.A. alone is if the Chargers stay in SD because SD is part of the L.A. market. Is this true?"

I have a bunch of relatives in San Diego and while visiting them, I've driven to LA and back more than a few times. It's close enough they get some fans from LA.  (It's also hilarious if you are flying between the two. It takes more time boarding/unboarding than the actual flight)"

StLouisRams,3a4crx,Mrubuto,4,Wed Jun 17 10:59:08 2015 UTC,As funny as it sounds probably not all that differently. The obvious difference would have been in 2010 Bradford/Tebow's rookie year. The Rams had a pretty solid rushing attack with SJAX but the defence wasn't what it is right now and the receiving core wasn't good at all with the exception of Amendola. So that year with Tebow at the helm I doubt they would have won the 7 games that they did and would have probably landed somewhere closer to 4. After that year I'd imagine that Tebow's tremendous flaws as a passer would be too aparent to ignore and we would have seen the same combination of Feely/Klemens/Hill/Davis/Keenum and ended up just shy of .500 most years like they did in reality. That is until they had a shot at either Luck or Griffin in 2012 in which case they would have definitely taken either of them (possibly russell wilson if they were forward thinking enough.) So in one way they probably wouldn't have fared terribly differently on the other hand they may have put themselves in a position to pick Andrew Luck if they had taken Tebow once upon a time. Sam was still the right decision at the time and it's a shame things didn't work out better than they did.
StLouisRams,3a4crx,fake_sagan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:38:55 2015 UTC,Great.  Now you have a quarterback you are paying $13-$17 million to sit on the bench and drafted another quarterback with a $7 million hit.  You also don't get an opportunity to make the RG3 trade.    I totally agree Sam was the correct pick.
StLouisRams,3a4crx,Dave_the_lighting_gu,4,Wed Jun 17 21:20:17 2015 UTC,We may potentially have Luck or RG3 as our QB
StLouisRams,3a4crx,DabDastic,2,Wed Jun 17 20:03:13 2015 UTC,They woulda ditched the sub-par QB sooner rather than get strung along thanks to injuries.
StLouisRams,3a4crx,JimboLodisC,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:44:55 2015 UTC,We would have Andrew luck
StLouisRams,3a2t4j,arnefesto,6,Tue Jun 16 19:58:47 2015 UTC,"Forget the California location...   I want to see the Rams solidifying themselves against a great scrimmage team in the Cowboys. While we have greatly improved our O-Line, theirs is arguably the best in the League, and it's worth the opportunity for our rookies to see their efforts up close. learning through direct contact and learning through osmosis. Plus, if our Defense really is the best out there, then we need to demonstrate it against Dallas' front line.   And quite honestly, I really enjoy watching Rams tackle Cowboys out of spite."

StLouisRams,3a1l7y,Fridge-Largemeat,5,Tue Jun 16 19:34:06 2015 UTC,"Probably not. He's going to be third in the pecking order for receiving behind quick and Britt, maybe fourth if Bailey impresses, maybe even fifth in line when you factor in Jared Cook, and we're already looking to be a run first team. He'll be third or fourth in line for runs behind Gurley, Mason and Cunningham. Teams punt away from him consistently to try and stop his returns. Improvement is all I care to see from Tavon this year."
StLouisRams,3a1l7y,frankoftank,9,Tue Jun 16 19:20:25 2015 UTC,"After watching the foles v bradford post from the other day I thought that this could be the year for Tavon. Lots of foles big plays were long, arcing passes that desean or maclin simply out ran the corner. Seems perfect for Austin."

And I do know there's an LA Rams sub. I'm a regular contributor, and people from this sub come by to drop downvotes all the time. From following the NFL to LA saga for many years, my money is on the LA sub being a lot more active from 2016 on."
StLouisRams,39zqjd,Seductive_Santa,-4,Tue Jun 16 17:20:33 2015 UTC,This is not a place for rational discussion and hasn't been for a long time.  You either toe the company line and say that the Rams are staying in St. Louis AND ignore all evidence to the contrary or you are a troll.

The closest these topics came to being talked about were, ironically, when /u/SoulardSTL and I talked about it.   The definition of ""adjacent"" could be the deciding factor in this stadium being built, yet a person who relied solely on /r/stlouisrams for their Rams news would only have heard about it from the McClellan interview (which included only one sentence on it and was downvoted) and my comments. They would know virtually nothing about the current state of the stadium.  It's not like the sub is drowning in content. Why not post more stadium stuff?"
StLouisRams,39zqjd,ajswdf,2,Tue Jun 16 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"I think the majority of us are not lawyers, civil engineers, or bureaucrats so I don't think there will be much interest about the details of the lawsuits, the nitty gritty of the stadium plans, or city ordnances. We want RESULTS, we want concrete information and we want to know exactly what's going to happen as it relates to the Rams, not a case study on all the red tape and bureaucracy involved with getting a stadium built.  Maybe I'm wrong, submit the content and I'm sure at least a few folks around here will be interested.

StLouisRams,39yz7z,charliedarwinsfather,2,Tue Jun 16 05:44:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for these! I really hope Foles still let's it rip this year, Sam had grown a bit gun shy due to being beat up over his first few seasons.  The 25 YD Billy Bajema gif does not seem to be the right play, though."
StLouisRams,39zc3o,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,8,Tue Jun 16 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"Barksdale really, really picked the wrong year to play poorly. He'd have gotten Saffold money if he repeated his 2013 performance."
StLouisRams,39zc3o,frankoftank,6,Tue Jun 16 02:58:58 2015 UTC,Barksdale struggled big time against the pass in the second half of last year and even regressed in run blocking as well. I've heard rumors he was dealing with some kind of injury but I don't know what. It'll be interesting to see which Barksdale shows up for the chargers. If he returns to form it would help them tremendously.
StLouisRams,39zc3o,LLv2,4,Tue Jun 16 03:25:05 2015 UTC,"They actually can be worse.  Not much, but this wasn't the worst line in the league last year."
StLouisRams,39zc3o,porkfish66,2,Tue Jun 16 05:05:24 2015 UTC,but seriously they can't be worse.   SHHHHH! Don't say that. Ever.  Especially not about the Rams.
StLouisRams,3a01am,SonicRainboom,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:07:32 2015 UTC,Right now it's the top 51 active rule and we have a hair over $7 million. Figure when it goes to all 53 and the PS we'll used about another $2 million(minimum).  http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/st.-louis-rams/cap/  Another site I've seen shows us with $10 million but it doesn't account correctly for the rookies salary.
StLouisRams,3a018u,Imbrandnewhere,6,Tue Jun 16 04:07:08 2015 UTC,"Personally, I am 100% for this trade and I have been since it happened. For sure, Bradford ihas an incredibly high ceiling, but we've been waiting too long for it. Something this team desperately needs is straight up consistancy, and that's something that looks very promising in Nick. If our receivers have even just an average QB throwing the ball with consistancy, I feel they can really have a good year. Of course, that opens up all kinds of opportunities for our revamped run game this year as well. Hopefully now we won't also have to rely on our degense as much, which might take some pressure off of them and allow to play as the dominant force we know they are. All of this from having a (somewhat) proven QB behind center, rather than an injury prone Sam Bradford or a n unreliable Hill or Davis.   That being said, I feel as I'd both back up QBs really stepped up the the plate when they were in. The were thrust suddenly into one of the hardest NFL divisions, and sometimes managed to be pretty productive. Unfortunately, it was just once again a lack of consistancy that really brought them down. Davis had a great few games, but really struggled as defenses learned to scheme against him. Hill could really sling it sometimes, but other times he'd throw picks at just absolutely crucial moments. I fell having an experienced starter will help fix those situations."
StLouisRams,3a018u,SonicRainboom,2,Tue Jun 16 04:17:08 2015 UTC,"thanks for the quick and thought out reply! I definitely understand the sentiment, and between Tavon Austin and Gurley I think you guys have a good chance at churning out a decent run game. Sounds like the backups were good backups, able to step in in an emergency but not the greatest options over a long stretch. Hopefully you guys have truly found a consistent starter with Foles, and honestly I'd take your guys' Dline over any of the three brady killers in the AFC east."
StLouisRams,3a018u,BrawndoTTM,6,Tue Jun 16 04:29:50 2015 UTC,"I was absolutely floored that Sam still had such trade value after two consecutive ACL tears. When the errant initial reports came out that said we had swapped first-round picks with the Eagles and given up additional draft stock plus Bradford for Foles, I thought that sounded about right. When the actual trade terms came out, I decided that Les Snead must be a wizard.       Sam had/has great potential, but I was fed up with his inconsistency, fragility, and team-killing salary. I don't know if Foles will be a great QB, but I'm confident that he can be a reliable, competent QB - which is all we need."
StLouisRams,3a018u,frankoftank,2,Tue Jun 16 15:05:20 2015 UTC,"I'm very happy with Foles. In theory, I think healthy a Bradord could realistically have a higher ceiling, but we live in the real world, not hypothetical land, and in the real world Bradford can't stay healthy. I would bet good money he doesn't last past game 7 this year. A khal who cannot ride is no khal. Franchise QB who can't stay healthy is worse than no franchise QB. I'd rather have even a poor-quality starting QB but who can at least stay healthy, like Geno Smith, than Bradford. Injured QB means that you're going to have backup scrubs who barely even practice with the main guys getting thrown in there constantly.That's not good. Hill/Davis exceeded expectations, but even then it was an awful situation."
StLouisRams,3a018u,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:47:15 2015 UTC,"I would have been happy with a trade for Nick Foles straight up just to save the Rams the $10+ mil in cap space and save my heart from watching another season ending injury to our QB.  Throw in the fact that we get at least a 2nd rounder as well, maybe even a 4th or 5th, I love it."

I hope he has success with Philly. He definitely deserves it. Hard worker who hasn't been able to get into a good stride for most of his career."
StLouisRams,39lona,sterusebn,9,Fri Jun 12 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"Bradford isn't a yeller or screamer. But he is a natural leader who has been the captain or co-captain of just about every team he's ever played on.  ""Players recognize toughness,"" Stoops said. ""They recognize commitment and discipline and who's working to get better.  ""Sam is as great a worker as I've ever been around. It matters to him. You're not going to find him being talked about off the field. You're going to know he's working in the meeting rooms. And he's going to work hard on the field.  ""To me, that's where you get your respect. A lot of guys talk a good game and don't do the other parts. But you can't fool the guys in the locker room. And talking isn't what gets it done.""   Bradford's leadership was always in question by Rams fans, and it always irritated me.  Some people think that 'leadership' means yelling, or cheerleading, or getting in guys' faces -- and that nothing else qualifies as leadership.  But let's look at two legendary QBs, Joe Montana and Brett Favre.  Montana was never an in-your-face guy, he didn't yell and he didn't wave towels and hoot on the sidelines but does anyone doubt his leadership?  Meanwhile Favre was about as rah-rah as any QB has ever been.  Two different styles of leadership and both completely valid and successful.  The reaction to this image of Sam irritated me the most.  Fans here and (much more often) on stltoday.com would point to this as proof that Bradford was an idiot who was befuddled by NFL defenses, a weak-willed coward who could only sit and shake his head at the thought of stepping back onto the field instead of rallying the troops like a real leader would do.  That's one interpretation, but why was it the only one?  We don't know what was going through his head while looking at those pictures, isn't it possible that he was shaking his head at how porous his offensive line was on every play, at how little time he had to set up and throw?   Isn't it possible that what we are seeing is nothing but a frustrated athlete who is doing his part while others around him are not doing theirs?  But instead the fans of his team reached the most negative conclusion about the guy.    Damn, the season can't start soon enough if I'm talking about Sam Bradford."
StLouisRams,39lona,DeniseDeNephew,6,Fri Jun 12 18:52:14 2015 UTC,"My reaction to that gif is that Sam knew as well as we did that Schotty's playbook was shit. Probably thinking ""why am I reviewing this if I knew it wasn't going to work before we snapped the ball?"""

StLouisRams,39lgdh,Perspective1310,4,Fri Jun 12 16:05:09 2015 UTC,"The article is actually very optimistic.  The name of it is, ""Long Getting Back to 100%"" -- that's a pretty positive spin already.  It goes on to say:   The 2014 season was tough for Chris Long. Known for his durability in addition to his consistent strong play, the Rams’ defensive end was sidelined for 10 games with a unique ankle injury. And even when he returned for the season’s last five contests, Long acknowledged following the season he wasn’t at full strength.  “It’s been a grind -- mentally a grind -- because you’re like, ‘Man I just want to be myself again,’” Long said at OTAs this week. “I think what’s been encouraging the last couple weeks, is I’m moving really well, and feeling really good, and feeling like myself so it’s a big relief.”  “You want to be out there to help your team,” Long continued. “You’re a captain. You’re supposed to be a leader. You don’t know what your place is when you’re sitting on the sideline. Even if you’re physically not capable of playing, or maybe shouldn’t be playing, you just want to play.”  Fortunately, as it stands now, Long says he’s just about cleared the long road to 100 percent.  “It took a lot of rehab and a lot of hard work in the offseason, but I think the hay is in the barn with that,” Long said. “I think now, it’s just getting re-acclimated to running and cutting and football, which has been pretty seamless for me. This is how I wish I would’ve felt earlier, but it’s finally here.”  While he had only a few in-season practices with Long prior to the injury, 2014 Defensive Rookie of the Year Aaron Donald said he can tell the defensive end is healthy.  “He’s moving a lot better than he did when he came back, and I know he feels better,” Donald said, adding he’s noticed Long seems happier, too. “He’s back to feeling good because he’s the captain. He’s the leader of this defense and that’s the guy we need out there with us.”   I think OP meant that we'll see a better Chris Long than we saw last year, so good news for us all."

StLouisRams,39m2k4,minorthreat21,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:29:24 2015 UTC,Never too early too speculate. Will this all be accurate? Nah probably not but we can still get a good range of what may need to be done and I love to hear other people's vision of the team.
StLouisRams,39m2k4,bretris,2,Fri Jun 12 18:38:53 2015 UTC,"Depends how they play. If a few of them have breakout seasons, then I can't see us keeping a lot of guys because we can't afford it; Snead's cap magic can only go so far."
StLouisRams,39m2k4,LLv2,-2,Mon Jun 15 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"I see most of the players living in Manhattan or Hermosa Beach and me not caring about them anymore.  Oh wait, you meant for the team.  Well, I just don't see a role for Isaiah Pead."
StLouisRams,39jmaq,CallOnTyrone,3,Fri Jun 12 04:39:38 2015 UTC,Jenkins and Gaines should start with Trumaine as the backup. Hopefully Joyner develops into a good slot guy
StLouisRams,39jmaq,RickSmith123,5,Fri Jun 12 17:37:55 2015 UTC,Also mentioned Jenkins is looking really sharp so far and Tavon Austin is looking real good. If just a few of our young players can put it together this year we'll be tough to beat.
StLouisRams,39jmaq,frankoftank,3,Fri Jun 12 15:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there were a lot of good tidbits in there.   There's not a whole lot of wiggle room when it comes to competition on defense since the Rams return all of their 2014 starters. We've already discussed the battle between Jo-Lonn Dunbar and Akeem Ayers for a starting linebacker job and that is the one spot that seems to be truly up for grabs. But there could also be some things brewing at cornerback that are worth watching.  At the March owners meetings in Phoenix, coach Jeff Fisher indicated that E.J. Gaines and Trumaine Johnson would compete for the starting job opposite Janoris Jenkins (who has been especially sharp in these OTAs). Gaines looks like the early favorite to win that job, with the Rams then figuring out what happens when they go into the nickel. On Thursday, Gaines worked with the first team at outside cornerback in the first half or so of practice before giving way to Johnson for the second half. In both settings, it's been Lamarcus Joyner who has worked with the first unit in the nickel.  Although the team isn't in pads, Gaines looks to be as solid as ever in his spot and it would surprise if he didn't eventually win the job. Johnson has had some strong moments but also dropped an easy interception on Thursday. For his part, Joyner says the coaches tell him he's ""light years"" ahead of where he was last year on the mental side. That's a good thing for him as he attempts to lock down the slot corner job.  Some other thoughts and observations from the St. Louis Rams' organized team activity Thursday afternoon:  -- As always, the ""this is an OTA and the team isn't wearing pads"" caveat goes here. Take it for what it's worth but Thursday was the best open to the media practice I've seen from receiver Tavon Austin. Austin made a couple of tough catches in traffic in early team drills, one on a slant and another on a deep corner route. He followed with a tough catch for a touchdown in traffic during red zone drills. I'll have more on it next week but Austin said after this is a big year for him and he's tired of hearing the ""bust"" label thrown around with his name.  -- In what amounts to not a big deal but certainly not a bad thing either, rookie running back Todd Gurley actually took a few snaps with the rookies after practice Thursday. No, not full speed, live team reps but a couple of handoffs with other players on the field, nonetheless. Per Fisher's custom, he likes to keep rookies on the field for a few extra reps after the veterans are done for the day. They don't have helmet or pads on and it's basically a walkthrough speed but it's the first time I've noticed Gurley doing it in these OTAs.   It's still way too early to know how these things will progress as the season approaches but it's much more fun to read about this than to bicker about lawsuits and the team owner."
StLouisRams,39hop0,JKaye57,28,Thu Jun 11 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"I'm obviously excited about Havenstein and Brown, don't get me wrong. But Evan Mathis is a legitimate talent and if we can find a way to convince him to come to St. Louis (not on a long term deal, maybe two years for $5-6million), it'll give Brown some time to develop instead of throwing him into the fire while giving our line some much needed experience."
StLouisRams,39hop0,Chillinthamost,24,Thu Jun 11 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly, this would make me feel a bazillion times better about our line and therefore our offense going into the season."
StLouisRams,39hop0,unseenshadow,10,Thu Jun 11 20:15:05 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. We have some young talent but it would be good to get another anchor in the offensive line. It is appealing to have a young line grow together, but I think Brown could take a bit of time to develop."
StLouisRams,39hop0,Yji,13,Thu Jun 11 20:13:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. Perfect fit for our team, former teammate of Foles, same time frame to allow Brown to develop, it'd be so amazing. Plus, Fisher takes care of his veterans and we want to run the football, a lineman's dream."
StLouisRams,39hop0,DesignatedDecoy,15,Thu Jun 11 20:33:29 2015 UTC,"He wasn't happy with 6 mil and wanted to renegotiate so it'll probably be more than that. The Rams have supposedly $9,142,648 in cap space (http://overthecap.com/salary-cap-space/) left but they haven't signed their rookies yet. Do they legitimately have a chance to sign him or is this a pipe dream?"
StLouisRams,39hop0,Kaos047,7,Thu Jun 11 20:43:51 2015 UTC,"Im sure the FO could work some magic, but we would for sure have to push some money into next years Cap."
StLouisRams,39hop0,DesignatedDecoy,4,Thu Jun 11 20:45:15 2015 UTC,"Any idea how much would free up if we released Pead? I imagine as a second round pick it would clear another million or so. There are ways to restructure other deals like Laurinaitis, maybe Saffold. We've done it a lot with Long in the past."
StLouisRams,39hop0,Kicker0fE1ves,6,Thu Jun 11 20:47:21 2015 UTC,If pead is released he has $344k of dead money and $940k of cap savings (http://overthecap.com/salary-cap/saint-louis-rams/)
StLouisRams,39hop0,DesignatedDecoy,5,Thu Jun 11 20:51:42 2015 UTC,"Why the fuck is Pead still on the roster? It'd be different if we didn't have great talent in front of him, but damn. Dude would probably be the 4th RB in Tennessee."
StLouisRams,39hop0,Kicker0fE1ves,6,Thu Jun 11 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"When he got injured last year, they had to pay him regardless of his roster status so they kept him around. There isn't any difference between dropping him pre-June 1 and  before the season starts so might as well give him a chance and see if maybe he magically learned how to live up to his 2nd round draft status."

Apparently, the only thing standing in the fulfilment of my wish is money. I think we could work something over, though, especially if Foles guarantees for the guy."
StLouisRams,39hop0,xKeyNin,7,Thu Jun 11 21:25:44 2015 UTC,I would feel pretty confident with this as our O-Line Week 1:  LT - Greg Robinson LG - Rodger Saffold C - Barrett Jones RG - Evan Mathis RT - Rob Havenstein  You'd have two pretty experienced players in Saffold and Mathis surrounding the inexperienced players. That would be a major help.
StLouisRams,39hop0,Achromatica,0,Fri Jun 12 01:00:02 2015 UTC,Was Havenstein a guard or tackle in college? Because I feel like he might be better suited for a guard spot and we could possibly kick Saffold back out to tackle.
StLouisRams,39hop0,xKeyNin,2,Fri Jun 12 03:00:52 2015 UTC,Dude is WAY too big and tall to be a guard
StLouisRams,39hop0,Daytwa313,-1,Fri Jun 12 06:33:35 2015 UTC,"Oops, wasn't aware of his size. Damn lol"

StLouisRams,39hop0,Daytwa313,3,Fri Jun 12 04:56:40 2015 UTC,Right tackle. Marz was the left tackle.
StLouisRams,39hop0,TB_Punters,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:08:48 2015 UTC,I stand corrected
StLouisRams,39hop0,ContrastingWords,5,Fri Jun 12 19:29:50 2015 UTC,"I would love for this to happen.  We have the cap space to get him, it would give the rookies some more time to develop, and he already knows Foles' pre-snap routine and cadence.  Perfect fit!"
StLouisRams,39hop0,bretris,5,Thu Jun 11 21:09:36 2015 UTC,Please tell me he likes Foles that would be a great addition.
StLouisRams,39hop0,NFLVideoConverterBot,2,Thu Jun 11 22:04:26 2015 UTC,Apparently he did. Check out this interview with NFL network a few years ago...  http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-am/0ap2000000297027/Evan-Mathis-Nick-Foles-always-maintains-his-poise

StLouisRams,39hop0,xKeyNin,7,Fri Jun 12 13:19:33 2015 UTC,Sorry to break the party but I don't think Mathis would like to finish his career with a young team. He will be able to choose between top contender teams. All I want is that he choose outside our division.
StLouisRams,39hop0,MathBeaudet,4,Thu Jun 11 23:14:13 2015 UTC,"Well I'm sure he'd like to play where he can make money. We could prolly back load his contract and release a couple non essential people so we have cap room, he'll be guaranteed a starting spot since we pretty much only have rookies at the guard position, and I'm sure he wouldn't mind coming to protect Foles again, he'd probably like to see a familiar face. Remember that around the time FA started there were rumors of the Eagles shopping Mathis... we were one of the interested teams... I think we might be able to get him."

The pessimist in me just keeps telling I'm in for another disappointing year, but the optimist in me keeps saying we've improved at so many positions that we HAVE to be better this year. For fucks sake can we just have a winning season finally?"
StLouisRams,39hqag,frankoftank,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:46:13 2015 UTC,I think we would have had a winning season last year if it weren't for Bradford's injury so how can we not expect one this year with a healthy Foles at QB?  You have every reason to have high hopes!  Even if he doesn't have another season like 2013 he's still a huge upgrade over our backups.   And what if he did have another season (or more) like 2013?  It's almost too much to fantasize about.

StLouisRams,39cjwi,tjb_32,10,Wed Jun 10 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"Considering how much Fairley has struggled to keep his weight down throughout his career maybe this is not such a big problem.  I'd rather have him come in underweight and put on pounds (which should be easy for him) than come in too heavy and have to work on losing fat.  Maybe I'm just being hopeful in thinking that Fisher said this as a way to stand by one of his guys or kind of flip the script.  Reporters probably ask about Fairley's weight all the time and it wouldn't surprise me if Fisher decided to turn it around.  (some beat writer, for the millionth time):  ""How's Fairley look?  Is he keeping that beer guy down at all?""  Fisher:  ""Beer gut?  Nah, if anything he is too thin but we have our nutrition guys working with him and he'll be back where he needs to be before the season starts.""  Then when reporters are talking to Fairley, instead of asking him about how fat he is (again) which probably pisses him off they ask if he's been able to gain a few and he can say yeah I'm up to 301 and I feel strong!  And the reporters and we fans can all breathe a sigh of relief -- he's not too skinny any more! -- instead of fretting that he's not keeping his weight under control.    That's my hope anyway.  I'm excited they signed him and I think that this being a contract year for him and with the guys around him he could have a monster season.  That D-line rotation is going to be awesome to see."
StLouisRams,39cjwi,DeniseDeNephew,6,Thu Jun 11 01:56:43 2015 UTC,In DET he was more of a pass rusher because they had Suh. I'm imagining he'll probably be used as a run stopper now so being bigger would be a plus in STL. Then again I don't know what he'll be used for when they have Brockers and Donald already
StLouisRams,39cjwi,diesel321,2,Thu Jun 11 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"I believe they asked him to lose weight as soon as they signed him, which would make this weird."
StLouisRams,39cjwi,wowbagger88,2,Thu Jun 11 01:49:01 2015 UTC,Is he going to be playing 3-tech and rotating with Donald or playing more of a NT role and rotating with Brockers? Without knowing that I don't know if excessive weight loss is good or bad. I still think it's weird picking him up at all. Unless we're going to rock a beastly 5-2 or just rotate him in on 3rd downs for 4 pass rushing dlinemen idk
StLouisRams,39cjwi,diesel321,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:56:02 2015 UTC,I don't know for sure. I can't see them regularly pulling Donald though.

StLouisRams,39cjwi,bluemandan,2,Wed Jun 10 23:15:16 2015 UTC,I took it that it wasn't so much as the number of lbs he was at but that it was an out of shape weight. Some guys like Wilfork are huge but can bang all game. That was always my understanding.

StLouisRams,39bovt,New_DudeToo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:58:31 2015 UTC,"We have more than one question mark on the team. I know you're looking at the young offensive line, but saying we have one question marks implies that you don't have any issues/concerns/questions about:   QB play. Sure, he's new, but can he lead our team to victory? RB play. Yeah, we invested a top 10 pick on our future star. That player is still recovering from an ACL injury. Not only that, we FOCUSED our draft on the run game, so we can't just have good running; we need spectacular running. WR play. Britt and Quick looked capable before Quick's injury. That in-and-of-itself is a question mark. Can Tavon step up? Stedman? Can the DL play like the top two defensive line that it is, or will we see another 2014 first-half? After upgrading our LB group, can they improve on last year? After being the weak link in our defense last year, can our secondary arise to the challenge and keep improving like it did?   Even once you get to through each of the positions, we had a HUGE issue in playcalling last year. Blame the QB injuries, blame the players, blame what you want; but playcalling was very weak. Can we overcome that obstacle?  The big thing the Rams have going is there is talent everywhere. While we have question marks all over the page, we have more than enough potential to make those questions go away. It's just a question (intended) of whether we do that or not."

StLouisRams,397xj7,helpimnaked,2,Wed Jun 10 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know if we're watching the same games man. They wore them 3 times just in 2014. Blue/Blue 3 times, Throwbacks 2 times, White/Blue 2 times, White/White 1 time. Wore them 6 times in 2013. Blue on blue are our man combination. They've introduced the white pants at home more."
StLouisRams,397xj7,iamlogan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:29:14 2015 UTC,So..truth be told I'm basing everything I say off a broadcast from last season when we wore them. I could have sworn that it was said that we wear them very infrequently and I kind of just took it as fact. My bad if I was wrong.

I sorely miss this guy and it bums me out that I might never see him dress up in Midnight Green ever again but I am still excited to see him light up the NFC West this year and into the future. I am very excited for you guys and I hope the Rams do big things this year, that is unless it is against my Eagles. Also, I'm positive that almost all of /r/eagles wants to see you guys do well with Nick at the helm. Just wanting to show some brotherly love!"

StLouisRams,397fov,kersey79,-7,Thu Jun 11 20:25:48 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of money, but when you consider the price tag of the stadium it's not a significant amount. They probably can't even estimate the cost of the stadium within $3 million. It also comes from the funds used to maintain and upkeep the Edward Jones Dome, so if you don't use the dome that money doesn't effect you. (In fact, that's part of the lawsuit against Nixon's stadium group, that they're not allowed to use that money to work on a new stadium.)"
StLouisRams,3991b3,baseballallday,5,Wed Jun 10 03:15:29 2015 UTC,No not one bit. We still have Mason and Cunningham. Between them 1000 yards running and another 500 or so receiving. That is as rooks. So you can bet they are a little better. Gurley doesn't need to come in day one and take a heavy load. In fact he doesn't need any carries for the first few weeks. Toughest game we will have early in the season is Hawks. Mason hit them for 85 in his second game of his career last year.
StLouisRams,3991b3,NewBroPewPew,2,Wed Jun 10 04:12:15 2015 UTC,But Seahawks also held him to 28 yards on 11 attempts week 17 last year :-(
StLouisRams,3991b3,RammingIntoChicks,2,Wed Jun 10 15:17:50 2015 UTC,That has more to do with the Hawks.  3rd best rush D and best pass D. They gave up 81 yards a game on average. Which is inflated by Charles and Murray! In fact Mason had the 3rd best game vs the Hawks with 85 behind Charles and Murray.  Week 1: 37 to Starks  Week 2: 32 Woodhead  Week 3: 38 Ball  week4: Bye  Week5: 29 Morris  Week 6: 115 Murray  Week 7: 85 Mason  Week 8: Stewart 79  Week 9: McFadden 20  Week 10: Williams 33  Week 11: Charles 159  Week 12: Ellington 24  Week 13: Gore 28  Week 14:McCoy 50  Week 15: Hyde 55  Week 16: Taylor 19  Week 17: Mason 28

Only 2 rbs (murray/mccoy) averaged more than 19 carries per game last year so expecting a rookie to come in and take on that type of workload (especially coming off major surgery) is not realistic
StLouisRams,391p7h,bretris,19,Mon Jun 8 16:40:33 2015 UTC,T.J. McDonal is honestly one of the most underrated safeties in the league. As long as he is able to keep up his production from last season anyway.
StLouisRams,391p7h,One_Half_Hamster,3,Mon Jun 8 16:46:25 2015 UTC,Agreed. He was arguably the best member of our secondary last year.
StLouisRams,391p7h,MacAnLuin,3,Mon Jun 8 23:17:28 2015 UTC,He was definitely the most improved member of our defense. He started off slow but so did everyone else on our defense. If we can get off to a strong start for once this year we may snag a wild card spot.

McDonald and McLeod will both be on the field as safeties and Barron will be like a nickelback/OLB/Murderer. Instead of playing 4 CB's vs heavy passing formations you play Jenkins, Gaines and Johnson and take Joyner out for Barron. Barron covers down on flat or mans the TE and just murders the sidelines and flat area. Rams played 4-3 a lot but usually only had 2 LB's on the field at once."

That honestly is just the way /r/nfl is...if the Rams start having a successful season we will see the typical ""SCARY! OOH SPOOKY!"" comments unless we get a playoff birth.   That sub is just one big circle jerk about the same teams and players and we are on the fringe.   Overall this team should be getting head nods but we have to prove it first. I can't say i'm excited for the day the Rams start whooping ass and everyone acts like they loved this team for ages and know all about us.

StLouisRams,398bb4,ajswdf,2,Thu Jun 11 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"most likely the NFL will pressure the Raiders to move there   Do you think the value of the Raiders will go up or down if Davis moves the team from the Bay Area to St. Louis?  Leave LA out of the equation since we know how much a move there would increase the team's value, but would Davis see a bigger leap in value sharing Levi's with the niners, or coming to St. Louis (and why)?  The Rams are last in franchise value but the Raiders are not far behind -- would the Raiders drop to the bottom or where would they land with a new but admittedly ordinary stadium?  Do you think the NFL has enough power over the team owners to force them to do what the NFL wants in terms of the location of their teams, even if it takes money out of the owners pockets?  We often hear that Kroenke would have to pay half a billion dollars in relocation fees to move from St. Louis to LA but Davis and Spanos would only pay a fraction of that to move to LA because they aren't moving as far (and may be allowed to split the fee!) -- so what would Davis pay to move from Oakland to St. Louis?  Would the NFL charge one owner half a billion and another something far less to move an almost identical distance?  (Imagine if a team wanted to relocate to London!  It would take all the gold in Fort Knox to pay the relocation fee.)  Do you feel that the NFL wants to stay in St. Louis?  I don't mean in a general sense, I mean do they specifically want to stay in St. Louis above all other non-NFL cities in America?  If so, why do you think they do?"
StLouisRams,398bb4,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:23:15 2015 UTC,"Do you think the value of the Raiders will go up or down if Davis moves the team from the Bay Area to St. Louis?    I honestly don't know. The problem is that there seems to be no solution in the Bay Area short of him building his own stadium, and LA might not be an option since Kroenke and Spanos both want to move there. So you're really comparing St. Louis to cities like San Antonio and Portland, and I'd say they're pretty comparable.   Do you think the NFL has enough power over the team owners to force them to do what the NFL wants in terms of the location of their teams, even if it takes money out of the owners pockets?   The Raiders are probably the least powerful franchise in the NFL (other than maybe the Jaguars). And when you consider their situation, I think they'd be willing to take St. Louis over other cities if the NFL pushed them hard enough.    Would the NFL charge one owner half a billion and another something far less to move an almost identical distance?   It's not the distance, it's the market size. LA is 5-6 times bigger than St. Louis, so you'd figure the relocation fee for going to St. Louis would be more like $50 million.   Do you feel that the NFL wants to stay in St. Louis?   They'd rather have LA than St. Louis, but in terms of St. Louis versus San Antonio, Portland, Sacramento, etc., I don't know if the NFL cares that much. They might prefer St. Louis since it has an NFL history those other cities don't, but if the stadium plan fails and St. Louis goes without an NFL team for 10+ years, they won't get any preference over any other city."
StLouisRams,398bb4,ajswdf,0,Thu Jun 11 01:33:33 2015 UTC,"The problem is that there seems to be no solution in the Bay Area short of him building his own stadium   Levi's stadium was built to hold two teams, why isn't that an option?  I know Davis has said that Santa Clara is not a place that Raiders fans feel at home but I bet given a choice between driving to Levi's (which for many Raiders fans is closer than Oakland), flying to LA, or flying to St. Louis to see a game I think I know which option most Raiders fans would choose.   I literally don't think they'd lose a single fan moving from Oakland to Santa Clara, and most of the money in the Bay Area is in the south bay anyway.    That's not to mention what Davis has said about moving to St. Louis."
StLouisRams,398bb4,DeniseDeNephew,0,Thu Jun 11 02:07:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but I believe Levi's was built to house one team. They considered designing it for two, but Davis shot them down so they just built it for one. Everything I've read indicates that Levi's would be very difficult for the Raiders to move in to. It's not an issue of fan support, but how they make money from the stadium."
StLouisRams,398bb4,Seductive_Santa,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:11:41 2015 UTC,"In an article I read recently it sounded like Levi's was built for two, according to Jed York:   ""For us, I’m always very clear: The deal with Santa Clara was not specific to another specific team. It was for a second tenant. A second tenant could come in if they wanted to. To date, nobody has really expressed an interest in being that second tenant at Levi’s Stadium.”   The same article also addresses the travelling distance   Davis said he could fly to Los Angeles from Oakland in the same amount of time it would take him to drive to Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, so the proximity was relative.   I thought this was pretty funny.  It might be true that a multimillionaire could hop into his corporate jet (or rent one) and make a quick hop down to LA but for us common folk, which most Raiders fans are, this is not a viable option and the statement that the two travelling times are the same is ludicrous.  You're probably right about the revenue streams though.  How do you think they'd compare between being a tenant at Levi's and whatever the terms would be in St. Louis?  The Raiders would not get any naming rights money in Santa Clara, would they in St, Louis?  They could get PSL money in Santa Clara since Levi's is already built and they wouldn't need to use the PSL money there and the niners PSLs don't apply to anything but niners home games, would they get any PSL money in St. Louis?  That's a couple hundred million dollars right there.   How about parking and concessions, etc.?  I suppose the niners could try to claim 100% of that revenue even if it were generated at a Raiders game but this is the kind of thing I am talking about (below) when I say that the NFL could pressure them into playing ball with the Raiders."
StLouisRams,398bb4,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:38:17 2015 UTC,"Besides the fact the the Raiders are already bottom barrel in terms of value, Davis can't build a stadium on his own dime. If Kroenke does claim LA, then the Raiders may have nowhere else to go. I know Davis has said he wouldn't want to be in St. Louis, but everything you hear is posturing until everyone lays their cards on the table."
StLouisRams,398bb4,eight26,-1,Thu Jun 11 01:36:18 2015 UTC,"Besides the fact the the Raiders are already bottom barrel in terms of value   Not according to Forbes.  They have the Raiders at #28 -- pretty low but not as low as the Rams at #32.  Also keep in mind that the Bay Area is a rapidly-growing area while St. Louis has been declining in population since the 1950's.  The Bay Area is a big market that is only getting bigger.  Why wouldn't sharing Levi's be a better choice?  Davis would get to keep his current, rabid fan base, play in an almost brand new stadium, have zero relocation fees, use the current practice facilities and administrative offices, there would be no nonsense about re-branding the team.  Even the players could keep living in their current homes.  Their attendance would almost certainly go up since there are a lot of Raiders fans in the South Bay who are unwilling to make the drive to Oakland.  Other than the niners potentially giving them a raw deal, where's the down side?  And if the niners did try to screw the Raiders, why wouldn't the NFL with all its overarching power force the niners to give them a good deal?  And as far as options go, the Raiders could even keep playing in Oakland on a year-to-year basis.  This is not a do or die year for them staying in Oakland unless Davis insists upon it.  There's no reason that they must leave Oakland this year or next, or any time soon, even with the city taking a hard stance against building them a stadium.  Libby Schaaf is not going to be the mayor of Oakland forever and it's not inconceivable that a new mayor may be more receptive to bailing the team out.  Still, Santa Clara seems like the ideal choice.  They can even keep calling themselves the Oakland Raiders."

StLouisRams,38pp17,bretris,9,Sat Jun 6 00:12:21 2015 UTC,God it's been a rough stretch to be a Rams fan in St Louis
StLouisRams,38pp17,DabDastic,-15,Fri Jun 5 23:42:52 2015 UTC,Right cause Rams fans outside of St Louis haven't lived through this stretch either?
StLouisRams,38pp17,bozo7337,7,Fri Jun 5 23:59:03 2015 UTC,I mean we had the worst 5 year stretch in NFL history here so.....
StLouisRams,38pp17,DabDastic,-10,Sat Jun 6 01:09:04 2015 UTC,And only people in St Louis experienced those 5 years? Rams fans aren't only in St Louis.
StLouisRams,38pp17,bozo7337,7,Sat Jun 6 04:13:33 2015 UTC,No but we have had to deal with the relocation issues on top of it. Not really trying to get into the whole LA STL debate I'm getting sick of it.
StLouisRams,38pp17,DabDastic,-7,Sat Jun 6 04:25:09 2015 UTC,Well maybe you shouldn't instigate it with your statements. You implied that only people who root for the Rams lived through the shitty decade we're coming out of. That very comment is s tarting the debate you say your sick of. Think before you speak. Your statement was idiotic and ignores a large portion of the Rams fan base.
StLouisRams,38pp17,bozo7337,6,Sat Jun 6 04:30:39 2015 UTC,Literally if I was any other teams fan saying for example a Bengals fan in Cincinnati  saying a statement like that no one would think twice. They are in St. Louis and what was posted was from a St. Louis newspaper I'll refer to the city they are in as of now. It's been a rough time to be a Rams fan anywhere
StLouisRams,38pp17,DabDastic,-11,Sat Jun 6 05:24:55 2015 UTC,"There's a difference. If you said ""It's been a rough stretch for St Louis fans"" talking about a Rams article then yes. The difference is all in that you said ""It's been a rough stretch to be a Rams fan in St Louis""."

StLouisRams,38o5bj,helpimnaked,16,Fri Jun 5 14:04:19 2015 UTC,"Same thing is said about every OC every offseason. Still, I dont doubt Quick."
StLouisRams,38o5bj,ClitorisNigga,11,Fri Jun 5 14:40:02 2015 UTC,I hate when writers just mention Austin's receiving numbers and write him off as a total let down. Would we like to see more from him as an offensive weapon? Of course. He still provides a home run threat that teams have to account for and plan against and is one of the most dangerous punt returners in the game. With a new OC and hopefully a healthy starting quality QB I'm hoping for the best.
StLouisRams,38o5bj,frankoftank,7,Fri Jun 5 16:04:37 2015 UTC,"Also, people overlook how many plays end up happening for others because the D focuses on Tavon."
StLouisRams,38o5bj,DougFunLove,7,Fri Jun 5 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"Yup, he's used as a distraction because he can score from anywhere. The Colts learned the hard way that you have to focus on Tavon or he'll tear you up."
StLouisRams,38o5bj,frankoftank,3,Fri Jun 5 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"This is the best asset that we got from Tavon. That man moves pre-snap and the whole fucking defense changes schemes. They MUST account for him on every play. And sometimes they don't...and Tavon tears up the field.   I think this year Tavon will play a slightly bigger role based off the fact that we are going to have a 2.5 headed monster in the RBs...and Foles is going to sync well with our VERY GOOD wide recievers. Quick, Britt, and Studman (also Cookie and Harkey) will all have to be accounted for...Tavon is going to get those stunner plays outta nowhere on 3rd downs I gurantee it!"
StLouisRams,38o5bj,price-iz-right,7,Sun Jun 7 03:24:27 2015 UTC,Remember that one time the Seahawks were so worried about him that Studman was able to take the ball to the house virtually uncontested?
StLouisRams,38o5bj,Tre2,5,Fri Jun 5 18:35:34 2015 UTC,Hahaha that was the greatest punt fake out I've ever seen. And we did it to the seahawks. Glorious.
StLouisRams,38o5bj,frankoftank,2,Fri Jun 5 19:05:31 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure we'll never see a trick play as awesome as that one was again.
StLouisRams,38o5bj,price-iz-right,2,Fri Jun 5 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think it worked so flawlessy and Fish has such large testicles that he'll do it again, and I wouldn't even be surprised if he pulled it off on the Seahawks.  That was hands down the funniest fucking play I have ever seen. I was jumping around the room screaming at the genius of it"
StLouisRams,38o5bj,martinepinho,9,Sun Jun 7 03:26:22 2015 UTC,"He can't be worse than Schottenheimer, can he?  But seriously, he has to be creative in his play calling given that most of the league knows what our philosophy is going to be. Yeah we're gonna favor the run game, it's how creative we're going to be that's going to actually make a difference."
StLouisRams,38o5bj,JKaye57,3,Fri Jun 5 14:59:14 2015 UTC,...So what you're saying is run Tavon up the middle?
StLouisRams,38o5bj,martinepinho,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:29:33 2015 UTC,Hopefully he'll be the other type of creative.

StLouisRams,38o5bj,martinepinho,6,Fri Jun 5 22:18:36 2015 UTC,That's too creative
StLouisRams,38o5bj,To3z,6,Fri Jun 5 23:01:33 2015 UTC,Just hope this doesn't hurt Tayvon. I want him to break out this season.
StLouisRams,38o5bj,CallOnTyrone,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:11:00 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Cignetti just gets him the damn ball, and not as a RB. He's fast as hell, he should be able to beat almost anyone on a deep route, or give him some screen and let him work the magic."
StLouisRams,38o5bj,mjbatt,5,Fri Jun 5 21:06:35 2015 UTC,Britt mentioned something similar during his interview after day 2 of OTA's.

StLouisRams,38jjen,Daytwa313,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:42:10 2015 UTC,"You never know really, Danario Alexander was a nobody and was on the practice team before actually playing. Granted that was when we had zero depth at receiver, you still can never tell especially when injuries start."
StLouisRams,38jjen,Wm_TheConqueror,13,Fri Jun 5 05:45:27 2015 UTC,"Poor guy, sad that he can't play. Props to the team for making sure his contract was signed and that he receives his signing bonus. After all, it's not his fault that he has this health issue. Here's hoping he did well enough in college to have a good fall-back career."
StLouisRams,38jjen,SoulardSTL,12,Thu Jun 4 17:41:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I love our Mizzou connection and was hoping to see him join the brotherhood.  Poor dude.

StLouisRams,38jjen,gabers24,5,Thu Jun 4 20:05:36 2015 UTC,It definitely sucks for him. Does anyone know if we get a compensatory pick next year or is just gone?
StLouisRams,38jjen,chemicalpoisons,3,Thu Jun 4 20:42:44 2015 UTC,I would assume its just gone.
StLouisRams,38jjen,One_Half_Hamster,3,Thu Jun 4 23:33:29 2015 UTC,And I was worried that things were going too well for this team... here's the equaliser. Wish nothing but good and restful years ahead for him. Stay strong Bud.
StLouisRams,38jjen,chemicalpoisons,4,Thu Jun 4 21:16:09 2015 UTC,"It sucks for him, but you are aware this probably doesn't effect our depth chart at all right? It's not much of an equalizer when he likely wasn't going to see the field."

StLouisRams,38fob6,tjb_32,18,Wed Jun 3 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"Guys, it's no surprise he's going to file to relocate. That's why the Task Force has been dealing with the NFL directly this whole time. That this has happened should come as a revelation to no one, in LA or STL. Let the process continue to play out, and we'll see where we are come October."
StLouisRams,38fob6,SoulardSTL,6,Wed Jun 3 23:53:36 2015 UTC,Yeah i'm not really sure why this piece of news is making people freak out. We have known for a while Kroenke intends to move to LA if hes allowed to by the league. Now we just have to hope the league hasnt been lying through its teeth the whole time.
StLouisRams,38fob6,Kaos047,9,Thu Jun 4 00:02:38 2015 UTC,"Now we just have to hope the league hasnt been lying through its teeth the whole time.   Has anyone from the NFL ever said that they wouldn't allow Kroenke to move his team if St. Louis can raise $150-$250 million?  I've heard Peacock say it, and I've read posters here and on stltoday.com repeat it ad nauseam but I haven't seen or heard any firm statement like that from anyone in the NFL.  So what lie would be going through their teeth?"
StLouisRams,38fob6,DeniseDeNephew,4,Thu Jun 4 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"The league is playing it as vague as possible, just so they can do whatever they want in the end."
StLouisRams,38fob6,Seductive_Santa,3,Thu Jun 4 08:22:33 2015 UTC,The league has said that they will follow their rules and give stl a fair chance. If stl does everything they are asked of and the rams still leave then they lied.
StLouisRams,38fob6,sgabriele,7,Thu Jun 4 05:04:31 2015 UTC,"I think you missed my point.  Who ever said that raising ~40% of the funds necessary to build a new stadium was enough?  The city isn't doing everything the NFL asked of them, it is (presumably, someday) going to do what their own Task Force decided was enough to keep the team.  Until the NFL and Kroenke say it's enough them it may not be enough.    As for a ""fair chance"", why would anyone not think that St. Louis had that fair chance and blew it?   The arbitrator sided with the Rams.  That was the fair chance.  Some might think the city deserves a second fair chance but the NFL Owners may side with one of their own.  A judge probably would too, after the city lost the arbitration."
StLouisRams,38fob6,DeniseDeNephew,0,Thu Jun 4 10:10:55 2015 UTC,What I said is that IF stl is able to do everything that the nfl is asking for than they would have been lying if they still let the rams leave because in their rules it states that kronkie has to exhaust all options with the city and he clearly has not done that yet. I never said that stl had already done everything necessary to keep the rams.
StLouisRams,38fob6,sgabriele,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:45:21 2015 UTC,Of course not. That would derail negotiations going on in San Diego and Oakland if the STL variables were already resolved.
StLouisRams,38fob6,SoulardSTL,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:53:03 2015 UTC,"If there is one thing we have learned about Kroenke it is that he doesn't really give a shit about what the NFL or St. Louis has to say. Not caring about what the NFL has to say has been known since he bought the rest of the team (he still owns the Nuggets and Avalanche). St. Louis dealing more directly with the NFL than the Rams is proof enough of the latter. Dude is going to do whatever he wants, no matter what anybody else has to say about it, it just remains to be seen what exactly that is."

StLouisRams,38fob6,Stone_Swan,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:47:36 2015 UTC,"It's like that implosion of the stands in Inglewood. People got worked up about that one too, even though both of these don't really mean anything that we didn't already know."
StLouisRams,38fob6,ajswdf,-2,Thu Jun 4 21:58:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Plus, the grandstands at Hollywood Park, the part of the Inglewood project that had all those ""Michael Bay EXPLOSIONS!!"", isn't even on the part of the development's footprint that would include the stadium. It was all hype and marketing to get more eyes on the project, even though it had nothing at all to do with the construction of a stadium."
StLouisRams,38fob6,SoulardSTL,2,Fri Jun 5 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"Wait, you think the explosions were a marketing ploy? You do know they have to get rid of the grandstands somehow, right?"
StLouisRams,38fob6,m0pi1,-1,Fri Jun 5 23:54:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, this was marketing.   The part of Hollywood Park where the grandstand was, is not where the new stadium would go. That's where they're going to put up apartments.   When you consider the condition of the structure at the time; how it's all just concrete and re-bar; that the timeline for the stadium's construction is open (building nothing until December); and that all the residual waste must still be hauled away, it would have been just as efficient to demo it with a wrecker and a ball on a chain. Plus, it would've been a helluva lot cheaper. Doing that, however, doesn't get nearly the local news coverage as you get with explosions.   This is not a criticism of Kroenke's marketing via explosions, but recognizing the explosions for the marketing they served."
StLouisRams,38fob6,SoulardSTL,5,Sat Jun 6 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"I saw this post and half expected the headline on the linked page to say ""Foles out with season-ending ACL tear"". Don't do that to me, man."

StLouisRams,389ops,Magnemmike,0,Tue Jun 2 21:37:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think that's all this lawsuit really is about, jamming the works. The suit itself is at best flimsy, and at worst it's abjectly dishonest. Still, it causes everyone pause to review it and contemplate what it means or could mean, when all it means is attention for a handful of state legislators who have a bug up their ass and no one else in the General Assembly cares.   From what I'm hearing, though, the parties involved in the actual decision making have recognized the frivolous nature of this suit and are continuing on with their preparations and considerations, from Peacock to Goodell...   Senator Schaaf's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more: his lawsuit is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing."
StLouisRams,389ops,ajswdf,-1,Wed Jun 3 20:16:10 2015 UTC,"I listened to his interview today, and it's made me even more certain that this stadium deal is pretty much dead. His points, both in this article and in the interview, are absurd to anybody who's objective and knows the situation. He sounds like he's grasping at straws.   “I don’t hear Sen. Schaaf complaining about us investing in the Kansas City Chiefs’ practice facility in St. Joseph or Rep. Parkinson upset about the Family Arena near his district,” Nixon said.   This is a prime example. Nixon isn't an idiot, he knows that the practice facility in St. Joseph not only cost a small fraction of what this stadium will, it was also part of funds everybody agrees Nixon has the power to use. In fact, those same funds are part of this stadium deal, and exactly zero people have complained about it.   Bringing up Family Arena is somehow even more absurd. I'm too lazy to look up Parkinson's district, but judging by the ""near"" in his statement, that arena's not even in their district, and it's in the St. Louis area. Just from this statement alone, it should speak volumes that Parkinson was in favor of one arena while opposed to this stadium, both of which are near, but not in, his district.  In his interview he said something like:   We have the best bond experts looking at this.   That is possible the single most damning statement in this whole process. He said that several times, but never quite bridged the gap between ""looking"" and ""agree we are allowed to do this"". Again, he's not dumb. He didn't just forget, or speak poorly. These experts must have bad news for him, or at best they haven't come to any conclusions yet.  If he's so sure this lawsuit is a waste of time, and that he's going to win for sure, why waste his time doing these interviews defending himself? Surely once the court comes back with his victory that's all that needs to be said. In reality it's dead and he knows it, he's just putting up enough of a front to make it seem like he tried and win political points in St. Louis. He knows the representatives outside of St. Louis are going to laugh in his face if he asks for this funding, and no reasonable person could really believe the terms of the bonds allow him to build the riverfront stadium without a vote."
StLouisRams,389ops,kpk2803,0,Wed Jun 3 02:55:39 2015 UTC,"I hope you're ready to be shit on,"
StLouisRams,389ops,ajswdf,-4,Wed Jun 3 03:04:26 2015 UTC,"Might as well give them more ammunition, while I'm in a ranting mood.  The St. Louis sports media, and by extension quite a few Rams fans, are so wildly optimistic about this stadium that it borders on insanity. I suspect the sports radio people are mainly saying it for ratings, but they're doing a disservice to their listeners by getting their hopes up.  These people seem to honestly believe that this stadium is such a good deal that the only reason these legislators oppose it is because they hate the Rams and want them to move. You know as well as I do that if the situation was reversed, where the state was wanting to build a new stadium in Kansas City under similar circumstances, all these people would be singing a different tune. They'd be pointing out how study after study has shown publicly funded stadiums are a bad idea, they'd point to the poor attendance, they'd point to the questionable at best legal justification for extending the bonds. But because it's their team, they're only going to hear what they want.  I want to ask one of these stadium supporters if they honestly believe any representatives outside of St. Louis will support this. Do they really believe that a representative from Kansas City is going to support the state paying for the second new football stadium in St. Louis in less than 30 years when Kansas City has some of the oldest stadiums in the NFL and MLB and paid for the renovations of both with minimal state help?   St. Louis should get the same exact state assistance that KC got, which is $50 million. If they want a new football stadium so bad, they should pay for it themselves, just like we did. And instead of complaining about these representatives slowing down the process, why don't you blame yourselves and your elected officials for not getting a stadium plan started years ago when you knew this was going to be an issue. If this stadium is such a great idea, why not let the legislature vote on it? That's what we're paying them to do."
StLouisRams,389ops,ajswdf,3,Wed Jun 3 03:29:19 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, this is cross-state jealousy defined!  /u/ajswdf: Dude, the General Assembly did vote on this, when they heard and wouldn't advance Senator Schaaf's bills to change the 2016 State Budget into the final issuance. Plus, if it was important enough to warrant a vote, why didn't they call for it on either the House or Senate floor? They didn't, even though they could, and let the 2015 Legislative Session expire. Not only that, but the General Assembly won't vote on every issue that comes before them, only the ones that receive merit enough to warrant a vote. We don't need and can't have a State vote on every issue, either; that's why we have a Legislature. Do we need a Civics 101 refresher course?  Don't be upset if Kansas City got one thing and STL may get another. The State's big enough for both of our cities.   Quite honestly, we had totally different takeaways from this interview. For disclosure, I'm a former political consultant and campaign manager who can separate that which I advocate from the pragmatism of reality. What I heard today is that Nixon believes the judiciary will side with the State over Schaaf; coming from the former Attorney General, I'll give deference to him at this time that he's not full of shit, grasping for straws, or however else you wish to phrase it."
StLouisRams,389ops,D9-EM,-3,Wed Jun 3 03:41:57 2015 UTC,"I believe we've discussed this before, so you know the assembly did not vote on the stadium issue directly. The reason it was left out of the budget was because the only thing they could do was prevent Nixon from paying on the bonds without legislative approval. But because we're paying these bonds no matter if a stadium gets built or not, it might lower the state's credit rating. They decided to spike that idea, instead favoring a lawsuit because what Nixon is doing is already illegal, therefore there is no legislation to be passed.  However, the reverse is not true. If Nixon wanted, he could have asked for a vote to clarify the issue with no risk to the credit rating or anything else. He and his task force decided not to go in this direction, likely because they believed they couldn't get the votes.  Be honest, if Kansas City was asking the state for a similar funding deal to build a new baseball stadium for the Royals, there's no way you'd be in favor of it. It's one thing for the state to build a road, or an airport, or a bridge in one city, but you can't say that the state should fund stadiums in one instance and not another.   As a political consultant, surely you know that Nixon is not speaking as a legal expert advising a government official. He's speaking as a politician to the media. What is he going to say, that he has no case and he's going to lose? He knows as well as we do that the details of this thing are going to be forgotten by this time next year, he just wants to cement in the public's mind that he fought against those evil representatives to save the Rams, regardless of whether he thinks he'll win or lose. That's what people will remember."
StLouisRams,389ops,ajswdf,0,Wed Jun 3 04:04:22 2015 UTC,Go home..
StLouisRams,389ops,ajswdf,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:32:30 2015 UTC,"Of course they didn't bring it before a full vote before the General Assembly. That's because they decided it was not worth their time.  Just because a bill is written, does not mean that it automatically gets venue on the Legislative floor. Also, just because a bill never makes it out of committee doesn't mean that it wasn't given due consideration and process by the Legislature. Schaaf's amendments to existing law did receive proper consideration, and it only made it so far before the members of the General Assembly with oversight determined it wasn't worth the time of the General Assembly as a whole.   Nixon's not asking for a vote because a vote is not necessary. Do you have any idea how many tens billions of dollars are approved annually by the State for which there is no direct public vote? That's where the General Assembly comes into play. Asking for a public vote here is totally unnecessary, exceedingly complicated, and unduly expensive.   More than all that, it's improper, as the existing statutory law stands."
StLouisRams,389ops,Wm_TheConqueror,3,Wed Jun 3 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"We're in agreement there, the issue is the ""why"" of the General Assembly not taking it up, which is, like I said, because of credit rating issues. The reason Schaaf's amendment would cause the credit issue is because extending the bonds is already illegal, so the only way to make it more illegal is to take away more power from the governor. Specifically, Schaaf's amendment would have made it illegal for Nixon to make any payments on the bonds without legislative approval. That is just absurd, since the bonds were already voted for, and Nixon's job is to pay them.  A public vote is irrelevant for the state's part of the funding. Nobody's arguing that the whole state needs to have a vote on it as far as I know."
StLouisRams,389ops,ajswdf,0,Wed Jun 3 17:10:31 2015 UTC,"Well then, let us agree that our discussions center on this issue: the legality of existing laws. Specifically, the laws that called for the municipal bond underwriting which led to the creation of (what is now) the Edward Jones Dome, which was approved by the General Assembly and signed by the Governor somewhere around 25 years ago. You say they are illegal. I say they are legal. My stating thus takes into consideration that they have been fully ratified and approved by the State of Missouri, and that their legality has not been questioned before in any court.   Here's the thing: Schaaf & the other legislators behind this lawsuit are not questioning the law's legality!   First, they were looking to add amendments to the existing law, to change how it operates (i.e. powers of the governor to effect it). This was knocked down. Then, they sued on grounds that the current plans for the North Riverfront Stadium are in violation of the existing law's authority. Their case is that the existing legislation only authorizes new construction that is adjoining to the existing Edward Jones Dome; however, they will lose, because ""adjoining"" isn't the standard of the law, but ""adjacent"", which the North Riverfront Stadium will be. That's the heart of their case, the legal difference between ""adjacent"" and ""adjoining""; they sued for ""adjoining"", but the law states ""adjacent"". They did not sue on grounds that the law in and of itself is illegal.   If the law was already illegal, then why were they fighting to amend it in committee under the presumption that it was sound? Flat out, any argument that it is already illegal will fail in the courts because, up until now, the plaintiffs have all engaged this law in recognition of its good standing.   Turning around now and stating that their failed amendments to the existing laws don't matter because it's illegal is like a bunch of kids playing cards. You have one kid who argues that he wants four discards, even though only three are allowed, and loses the hand. Then, he argues that the hand was illegal because the dealer didn't shuffle them enough times to his satisfaction. If he would've had 4 discards and won, you'd never hear him argue about the number of shuffles the dealer did, and all you're left with is a self-righteous sore loser who's making all the other players mad."

StLouisRams,388ll7,Minnesota_Slim,5,Tue Jun 2 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"The legislature had time to stop this via legislation, and failed to do so.  Timeline isn't an issue as far as the lawsuit is concerned. The law allows him to go forward with this plan. The stadium will provide an economic benefit. Says the representatives who are against it are Chiefs fans, implying that's why they oppose it. Goodell praised the stadium efforts. Says the issue of the stadium being adjacent to the convention center is a non-issue. Mentions how only 6 legislatures signed onto the lawsuit. Not sure if the Rams will be in St. Louis in a year, more commited to keeping St. Louis an LANFL city.   Not anything new really. If I was a Rams fan in St. Louis, I'd be concerned about their lack of confidence in keeping the Rams."

StLouisRams,388ll7,Minnesota_Slim,2,Tue Jun 2 20:45:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't cry too much about losing the Rams.  Obviously I don't want to, but I'm pretty tired of Cranky kroenke.  It's all going to come down to what the owners want to do in a few months.  I was pretty excited about Nixon's enthusiasm and confidence that the project will not be hindered by this lawsuit.  We will see if he is right in the next couple of weeks."
StLouisRams,388ll7,Dave_the_lighting_gu,0,Tue Jun 2 20:47:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get too excited. After giving it a bit of thought, there was one thing he said that seemed sketchy. He said ""We have the best bond experts looking at this"" several times, but each time he stopped short of saying the experts said he was allowed to do this.   He also stretched the truth on the legislature not passing anything to prevent him from doing it (they were stopped by credit rating concerns, not because they agreed with the stadium funding, not to mention there's no need to change the law if they believe it's already illegal). He also mentioned that the state helped fund the Chiefs training camp in St. Joseph, which is true, but that training camp only cost $10 million, and the state contributed not much more to our recent stadium renovations. Generally people who are the winning side don't have to stretch the truth to prove their point.  On a side note, his dismisal of legislature's concerns because they're Chiefs fans is a bunch of crap. Imagine if KC wanted the state to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a new Royals stadium, and he dismissed concerns from St. Louis area legislatures as just a bunch of Cardinals fans. I don't think that'd go over very well."
StLouisRams,388ll7,ajswdf,2,Tue Jun 2 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"The KC stuff was him pandering to his audience (he is a politician after all).  I just can't see him speaking publicly like this without being pretty confident he is on the right side of the law.    Like I said, it won't take too long to see what happens.  No point in over speculating.  His enthusiasm merely calmed my feelings on the matter a bit."

StLouisRams,37w4qp,MizzouR,7,Sat May 30 22:07:06 2015 UTC,I'm not an expert. But I have written a few papers about this before graduating college this spring so I have read a lot of sources on this. It is not economically beneficial to build a stadium. Not for St. Louis and not for Missouri. Every real source I find argues the contrary.
StLouisRams,37w4qp,jrose6717,2,Mon Jun 1 18:58:08 2015 UTC,"So I see what he's saying, but it's trumped by one very big fact.  The current Dome isn't paid off yet and they want another one.  I highly doubt the new stadium will last 30 years.  They'll want another one in  15 again.  it'll get pushed, they'll threaten to leave, in 20.  10 years shy of payback again.  Leaving us with 20 years total of unresolved debt.    Do you think they'll pay for stadium 3 themselves or want more public money?  Stand up to them now.  Band together with, San Diego and Oakland, and send a message to the NFL.  NO MORE PUBLIC MONEY FOR BILLIONAIRE OWNERS!  Can you imagine the shit storm the NFL would be in if all of sudden 3 cities called their bluff?  Don't go thinking that LA can support 3 teams either.  You'd dilute their value too much.  IMO this is what needs to happen, and now is the right time for it.  You've got more teams that want to move than places to move them.  Call the bluff and fuck'em all."
StLouisRams,37w4qp,FanFuckingFaptastic,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"Nobody may need to call the NFL's bluff.  The window for publicly-funded stadiums may be closing.  From http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/16/stateline-obama-proposal-taxpayer-subsidized-sports-stadiums/24845355/:   If President Obama has his way, the nation's taxpayers would not help finance a new arena proposed for the Milwaukee Bucks professional basketball team.  Nor would taxpayer-financed, tax-free bonds be used to help finance a new stadium being discussed in St. Louis for the NFL Rams, or in Oakland for a new complex aimed at keeping the area's professional football, baseball and basketball franchises from leaving town.  An obscure item in the president's new budget would put an end to the long-standing practice of states and cities using tax-exempt bonds to finance professional sports arenas, a practice that costs the U.S. Treasury $146 million, according to a 2012 Bloomberg analysis."
StLouisRams,37w4qp,DeniseDeNephew,7,Wed Jun 3 22:13:10 2015 UTC,This is bullshit.  Just about every single reputable economic study in history has found that publicly-funded sports stadiums bring negligible to zero economic benefit.  Here are some examples: http://college.holycross.edu/RePEc/hcx/Matheson-Baade_FinancingSports.pdf http://economics.umbc.edu/files/2014/09/wp_03_103.pdf  Here's an interesting article about the subject too: http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/09/if-you-build-it-they-might-not-come-the-risky-economics-of-sports-stadiums/260900/
StLouisRams,37w4qp,HecticEpic,-2,Sun May 31 02:49:39 2015 UTC,So a study on stadiums other than the one here in STL is more accurate than a study done on the specific stadium and financing in STL? Makes total sense...
StLouisRams,37w4qp,Kaos047,5,Sun May 31 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"They came to a conclusion that no other reputable economic study has reached.  Likely, they did it using the flawed methods demonstrated here: http://www.humankinetics.com/acucustom/sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/7669.pdf  If they really did legitimately find that this stadium will have a great positive economic impact on the state of Missouri, then these researchers will have a Nobel Prize coming their way pretty soon, and I will applaud them."
StLouisRams,37w4qp,HecticEpic,2,Sun May 31 15:25:08 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I agree with you. However, it is gonna be hard to justify building a stadium using potential future income taxes on players, coaches and staff if the Rams leave after this season. Tax dollars for 2016 would be $0."

So we only need $50 million right now to be fully paid in 10 years."
StLouisRams,37w4qp,D9-EM,0,Tue Jun 2 20:54:33 2015 UTC,Will we see positive economic growth if we sit back and let another multimillion dollar business leave Missouri while letting 50+ abandoned buildings stand?
StLouisRams,37w4qp,Musingmike,2,Sat May 30 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"Considering the NFL contributes just about nothing to the local economy and is tax exempt, will it really matter?

StLouisRams,37w4qp,D9-EM,-1,Tue Jun 2 02:31:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, it will matter to a lot of us. Why should we let this happen without a fight?  STL has something to lose here. It will become less of a city even. They're proposing no new taxes AND we keep a team that we love.   And the Rams actually DO pay taxes. All players/employees and even Kroenke pays taxes. The Rams aren't exempt."
StLouisRams,37w4qp,Musingmike,0,Fri Jun 5 00:42:46 2015 UTC,"St Louis should just focus on an MLS expansion. I'm saying that just to be nice because facts are the Rams are likely leaving whether the state likes it or not. I'm an LA based fan, but frankly football is pretty low on my interest meter in comparison to baseball, hockey, basketball, and soccer. I can live without football so i'm not dying for some team."

StLouisRams,37rdpy,ThirdTimesAnAlt,9,Fri May 29 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"We're a team that, at this moment in time, has a plethora of serviceable runningbacks. Gurley, Mason, Cunningham are the top three. Reynolds is the special teams ace.   Both Watts and Pead, if they wanna remain on the team, have to be less stupid. Considering we're young at the position and I doubt we want so many runningbacks on our 53 man roster/practice squad, I can see one of Watts or Pead being cut. Watts should do his best to not make things easy for the front office."
StLouisRams,37rdpy,JKaye57,4,Fri May 29 20:39:46 2015 UTC,"Watts or Pead being cut   They're both going to be cut. The only reason Pead is around still is because there was guaranteed money and he was on the DL anyway. I'm sure they'll see if he's improved at all in training camp , and in the likely case that he hasn't he will be cut.   Watts I am almost positive that he's leaving. With a bust like this, and being a UDFA, and being our 4th string RB, there is not much of a reason to keep him. Pick up a new UDFA this year that can fill the same role."
StLouisRams,37rdpy,helpimnaked,3,Fri May 29 22:41:45 2015 UTC,"Let's be completely honest; you're staring at a roster of Gurley, Mason, and Cunningham as Watts. As much of a risk as it is, PEDs may be your best shot to make a roster. He's not beating those guys out without it.  I'm not supporting the choice, just thinking in their shoes. In HS, I was a 5'10'', 215 poind OG. I had options too. I chose not to explore them because, in the long run, 5'10"" is very unlikely to transition to any sort of lineman, and I'm slow as shit. That being said, if there was a chance it would help me get to college, I'd definitely have considered it."
StLouisRams,37rdpy,Sauceman87,6,Sat May 30 02:52:53 2015 UTC,I'd guess unless they really really like him for special teams he probably ends up cut. Way too many backs on our roster of equal talent and usefulness to let a guy who is our 4th back get suspended for 4 games.

StLouisRams,37q9v1,RatherDashingf11,21,Fri May 29 15:24:36 2015 UTC,Imo the Rams only made themselves a more difficult team to beat.  If we can avoid any major injuries this should equate to a playoff team.
StLouisRams,37q9v1,vanlefty,3,Fri May 29 16:12:29 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. If our offense can perform at least 'decent', and our developing defense returns to its form from the second half of last season, we're going to see a lot of nail-biters and increasing amounts of Ws"
StLouisRams,37q9v1,DiscoJer,2,Fri May 29 16:17:02 2015 UTC,"If the defense were really good, the offense wouldn't have to even been defense. See Baltimore winning the SB with Trent Dilfer"
StLouisRams,37q9v1,NewBroPewPew,2,Fri May 29 22:50:41 2015 UTC,That was statistically top 10 greatest defense ever and the best run defense ever. They also ran the ball.
StLouisRams,37q9v1,DiscoJer,9,Mon Jun 1 01:56:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe on paper. But in practice?  Last year the defense was average, basically. 17th in yards per game, 16th in pts per game."
StLouisRams,37q9v1,ThirdTimesAnAlt,6,Fri May 29 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"We had a shit first half of the season, and a spectacular 2nd half. If the defense plays the same way they did the 2nd half of last season, we probably end up with a top-5 defense."
StLouisRams,37q9v1,tylerjehills,3,Sat May 30 00:39:29 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the numbers will look a whole lot better when the defense can get some rest thanks to the offense pounding out long drives and eating clock. Considering our offenses knack of short drives and turnovers last season, middle of the pack defensive numbers are pretty damn impression (especially when you factor in strength of schedule)"
StLouisRams,37q9v1,8q5,3,Sat May 30 01:21:16 2015 UTC,"Take away the tds scored when the defense wasn't even on the field (which was a lot, we had 4 more scored on us than the 2nd highest team in the league) and our points per game over the season improves to 4th"
StLouisRams,37q9v1,SoulardSTL,7,Sat May 30 06:45:18 2015 UTC,"This off-season has seen the Rams take care of our biggest issues: consistent O-Line weakness, our injury-prone QB (with a huge ass contract), and an undefined offensive attack. We've realigned towards the run, claiming a great RB in Gurley to platoon with Mason, beefed up the O-Line into a solid wall designed for the run, and swapped out the expensive QB for a more reasonably-priced QB who also has demonstrated great leadership skills and a solid throwing arm.   Meanwhile, we hardly do anything to the Defense, and it's still heralded as monstrous. Good times."
StLouisRams,37q9v1,frankoftank,2,Fri May 29 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"Well on defense we still manage to upgrade at OLB with Ayers and added even more talent to the D line with Fairley, and having a health Chris Long will help. We should be better on both sides of the ball."
StLouisRams,37q9v1,DesignatedDecoy,8,Sat May 30 15:49:12 2015 UTC,"They have the best defense in the league now with Ayers and Fairley joining that group up front.    I think that's a bit of a stretch and they probably typo'd defensive line. I find it hard to believe that their LBs and secondary are good enough overall to propel the Rams into the best defense conversation. I think this group has a lot of potential, don't get me wrong, but defenses have 11 players, not 4 and an amazing defensive line isn't going to change the fact that the Rams lack even a single blue chip player behind it."
StLouisRams,37q9v1,usernamecouldimprove,4,Fri May 29 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"I assumed a typo at first too, but really our secondary is solid with the McSafeties, EJ Gaines, and Janoris already leads the franchise record for pick 6s (maybe the record for one game, not sure) and the LBs were solid before Ayers. I personally wouldn't argue they are the best in the league, I just really enjoyed we are getting recognition from main stream media for a change"
StLouisRams,37q9v1,frankoftank,5,Fri May 29 16:46:51 2015 UTC,"So we're just going to gloss over how mediocre our pass defense is? We had trouble stopping the deep pass in every game last year, except for maybe when we rocked Oakland."
StLouisRams,37q9v1,ITameFatGirls,3,Fri May 29 18:38:47 2015 UTC,"What we need out of our pass defense is consistency. Last year it seemed solid for most of the game, then someone would make a bonehead mistake and leave a WR completely uncovered a few times a game. If the pass D just cuts down on those horrible mistakes, I think we'll be at least average in pass D."
StLouisRams,37q9v1,M3rc_Nate,0,Sat May 30 15:55:41 2015 UTC,"I'd be down with best defense in the league if we had a true ball hawking FS and a pro-bowl level MLB.  Alec has to be more consistent and McLeod shouldn't be in on obvious passing downs.  Our DLine should mask our secondaries short comings.  I know we had 0 sacks through the first 5/6 weeks?  That was anomaly and with the the guys in a new Williams scheme, I think we have potential to be a top 5 but it comes down to the offense.  If we keep the TOP in our favor this defense can be a wrecking ball against anyone outside a Pats/GB offense."

StLouisRams,37or6o,Mister_Dane,6,Fri May 29 05:22:48 2015 UTC,"The NFL is hoping and praying that the funding for the riverfront stadium falls through. I never bought this ""Carson is ahead"" stuff. Inglewood is clearly the superior stadium, and if the league had their choice they'd have the Rams and Chargers playing in Inglewood with the Raiders playing in a new shiny stadium in Oakland.  The problem for the NFL is that San Diego and St. Louis have proposals, while Oakland has said no public money for their stadium. The only way the Raiders stay in Oakland is if the stadium is 100% privately funded, which I think is actually possible, but the NFL might not like it (since other cities in the future can point to it when asked for money).  I believe that the NFL's plan B, if St. Louis gets all the funding they need for a stadium, is to let Kroenke move, but to paint him as the bad guy and say they tried to make him stay, but they couldn't stop him. Then they will force Spanos to stay in San Diego until the Raiders get a new stadium, whether it's in Oakland, St. Louis, San Antonio, or wherever. That allows them to use LA as leverage against whichever city they're negotiating with. Once the Raiders are settled, then the NFL will let the Chargers do whatever they want, whether it's stay in San Diego or move to LA."

Then again, this is an issue that we've known for some time would manifest: Schaaf would end up suing everyone because he's unhappy with everything. This surely hasn't stopped STL's momentum, as waiting for this out-state guy to file suit would've been like waiting for the rain to fall. It happens, it doesn't stop anything, and when it happens you deal with it and move on. I'm more interested in Judge Dowd's return to the bench so the City issue can be heard and that issue adjudicated."

He still has a few months to go before his recovery's complete, but right now he's just not throwing in their preseason.   Feel bad for him. From all I've heard Sam's a real good guy, and you never want to hear of potential scrapped because of injuries. Same time, we've endured his injuries for years and still had to pay his very high contract. The trade for Foles looks better and better every day, not only because of Sam's continued recovery, but for the quality of QB & leader Foles is as well as the massive salary cap boost we recognized once no longer tied to Sam's contract.

StLouisRams,37luxe,bretris,9,Thu May 28 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"Meh. This issue was already approved by the MO General Assembly. These legislators just voted on the other side, lost, and just want to keep talking about it so people know who they are before they're term-limited out.   Crediting /u/seductive_santa and his post in the other thread about the subject:      This will get thrown out. This guy has no standing and is butthurt he couldn't block it in the first place. Trust me, I'm from SoCal and know what news to get excited about."
StLouisRams,37luxe,SoulardSTL,3,Thu May 28 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"It wasn't approved, all that happened was that they didn't make it illegal for the governor to pay for bonds on a stadium without legislative approval, and the only reason that was spiked was because of concerns over the state's credit rating (i.e. it would have added risk to any investor looking to buy Missouri bonds because it makes it less likely the state would pay them back).  In reality Nixon and his task force is almost certainly going to lose here. Bill McClellan says the same thing. The governor can't just extend the bonds by himself because he wants to."
StLouisRams,37luxe,ajswdf,6,Thu May 28 21:35:46 2015 UTC,"Respectfully disagree. The General Assembly decided it was not worth a vote amongst themselves, let alone necessitating a statewide vote. That's what their job is, to act in the name of the people of the state. They did. The issue was raised but tabled, not called for a vote, not even leaving committee.   From the Kansas City Star:      Lawmakers considered but did not pass a bill requiring legislative or voter approval for state spending on a new football stadium in St. Louis. Nixon has said he has the authority to commit the state to additional borrowing for a proposed $1 billion facility in St. Louis.   In effect, this was the MO General Assembly tacitly authorizing the financing by doing nothing to change it. They determined it could progress because the financing's current structures are legal, including the authority for the Governor to extend these bonds.There were those who objected to it, their opinions were noted, and the General Assembly decided to let it progress as-is.   It's not that the Governor can extend the bonds ""because he wants to"", it's because he has the legal authority to do so.   The budget passed. The case has no merit and will likely be thrown out. The plaintiffs in this suit are just being obstructionist mostly for their own political gains. They're using the courts to logjam the issue because they didn't get their way in committee.   Also, Bill McClellan is a gadfly who shits on everything that's news, the first to say a silver lining is surrounded by gray. If news broke later tonight that an asteroid was on a collision course with the Earth, he'd cheer the asteroid and boo NASA. That's what he's doing here, looking for doom and gloom. Of all the people whose opinion I'd seek, I'd seek out a constitutional lawyer or bond underwriter, not Bill McClellan."
StLouisRams,37luxe,SoulardSTL,4,Thu May 28 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"The Star oversimplified it. This article gives a better summary.    The debate pitted two Republicans – Sen. Ryan Silvey of Kansas City and Diehl of St. Louis – against each other. Diehl, on the phone with House Budget Committee Tom Flanigan’s staff, refused to cede, citing concerns about the potential harm changes to the Office of Administration’s authority to pay its bonds could have on the state’s credit rating.  “We have House position that was put forth by attorneys. They advised me they we take the position we should take. I followed the attorneys,” he said. “I’m not an attorney.”   In other words, it's exactly as I said. The removal of that language from the budget has nothing to do with the legislature's opinion on the stadium itself, it was simply an issue of credit rating."
StLouisRams,37luxe,ajswdf,3,Thu May 28 22:19:37 2015 UTC,"The Legislature gave no opinion to the stadium AT ALL.   This is about municipal bond underwriting and the legalities of preexisting public debentures. Here, we have an existing bond for which language exists allowing for its extension for the same or similar purpose. The General Assembly passed it, noting the objections of certain legislators, but determining that their wanting to fuck with the payments of the State's existing debts, including threats to not pay promised owed monies, is an absolute detriment to the economic viability of the State of Missouri as well as the State's credit rating, which non-payment of authorized public debentures would most certainly lead to a sharp decrease in the State's credit rating to garbage. The Speaker of the House threw out the suggestions of his own party's legislators because they were terrible ideas and contrary to existing laws (i.e. you pay your debts). In concurrence with his attorneys, and being an attorney himself (practices at Husch Blackwell), the Speaker of the House refused to cede from the whining actions of the objectionist Silvey who wants to be Lieutenant Governor some day.   You can argue that this is a different purpose, but you can't argue that the General Assembly passed the State Budget, which allowed this to proceed, and that this is all the actions of Schaaf trying to make a name for himself. The only name he has earned so far, including and especially among his fellow Republicans, is ""asshole""."
StLouisRams,37luxe,SoulardSTL,3,Thu May 28 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"We're in agreement on your first two paragraphs, but I fail to see how you can make the jump to saying the legislature gave it's tacit approval of the new stadium. Your statement:   This issue was already approved by the MO General Assembly.    is just factually incorrect. As you just said:   The Legislature gave no opinion to the stadium AT ALL.    The issue at hand is whether or not Nixon has the power to extend these bonds, by himself, to pay for the new stadium. Other than passing legislation that makes it so clear as to remove all doubt (which, as we discussed, was unreasonable for other reasons) the legislature's only move is to file a lawsuit.  Whether or not Schaaf and other are doing this at least in part to score political points is a separate issue altogether (although I'll agree with you that, yes, Schaaf wants some of those delicious political points).   In my opinion, and I've followed this stadium drama very closely for years, you're setting yourself up for disappointment by dismissing this lawsuit too easily. Their concerns are, at the very least, not completely ridiculous."
StLouisRams,37luxe,ajswdf,0,Fri May 29 00:27:00 2015 UTC,"Well, I did think on that a bit. And while the MO General Assembly gave tacit approval by consciously not taking issue with the muni bonds' underwriting and the powers of the Governor's office to execute the agreements as written, I do agree that they did not sign anything new in full affirmation of that. Perhaps a better term would have been ""cleared"" or ""consented"".   I do see the issue differently than you do here. The underlying de facto issue is the powers of the MO Executive to carry out these actions under its own power, an important issue that's far beyond the stadium issue. But, it's being contested in the lawsuit as illegal bond underwriting, that the documents themselves were executed in violation of the Missouri Code of State Regulations for reasons other than it provides too much unilateral power to the Governor. It may be interpreted as the first thing, but it's not being acted upon in that matter.   And I'll tell ya, I've anticipated these guys logjamming the works for some time. It's in their nature to sue to get their way, especially Schaaf's. I personally see this suit as standing on very weak grounds legally, but the fact that it has been filed is damaging to the efforts. I think Schaaf would be much happier to see the development fail, as an obstructionist, than he would be to see his lawsuit succeed in court."
StLouisRams,37luxe,SoulardSTL,5,Fri May 29 15:51:42 2015 UTC,"lol you're going to far.    Remember, the SENATE passed that legislation requiring approval before bonds are extended 26-5.  Unless you think those 26 ppl are also assholes (maybe you do lol).   Not to mention there are 4 other republicans in the suit and even a democrat.    By all accounts it was Diehl who scrubbed the language last minute and guess what? Diehl aint there no more.    Besides, whether or not they were blocked in the House by the speaker (From STL county) who is no longer there, that should have NO bearing on whether or not what the Governor is trying to do is legal or not.  If the suit is right and what the gov is trying to do violates the law, then he shouldnt be able to do so. End of story.  These 6 obviously think he doesnt have the authority and it is well within their rights to file suit and gain ""clarity"" on the law, just like the pals from the RSA are doing with the city.    Oh, and here is a tweet from a sports lawyer re: this lawsuit.    ""I need to study this Rams stadium lawsuit more closely but at first glance it raises legitimate legal questions.""  https://twitter.com/McCannSportsLaw/with_replies  So I wouldnt be so quick to dismiss it.   Again, they are saying the Governor is VIOLATING CURRENT LAW by his actions/future actions.  That is an independent and valid reason in which to pursue a lawsuit. Just because they were stopped in the House by Diehl from doing so DOES NOT MEAN the Gov can continue to pursue actions not authorized by statute."
StLouisRams,37luxe,revolver066,1 point,Thu May 28 23:38:12 2015 UTC,"2 points:   That the lawsuit was filed by a Senator and some House Reps over a piece of legislation (muni underwriting) doesn't mean that it has more credibility in the legal system than if some regular citizen sued the State because he thinks other legislation is illegal. There are plenty of people out there who sue the government regularly because they believe social programs like Medicaid are illegal, but just because they filed a lawsuit doesn't mean those social programs are in imminent danger of being shut down.   My other point goes to the muni bonds themselves. They have been underwritten and in effect for almost 25 years. It seems rather strange that they would be challenged with a viable strategy today. I'm not saying it can't happen, but this is something that people would've found out beforehand, whether a legislative aid or a consultant to the MO Department of Economic Development. Plus, since this issue had been settled already by the General Assembly (regardless of who the Speaker of the House is), it really doesn't seem likely that their case has full standing. As a matter of civil procedure, it wouldn't surprise me if the courts dismiss this issue quickly.   Quite honestly, I'm curious in learning more about their arguments, but from what I've read already, the underwriting should stand as-is."
StLouisRams,37luxe,SoulardSTL,2,Fri May 29 15:31:24 2015 UTC,"LA is a much larger market, and that stadium he designed for Hollywood Park is amazing. STL just cant compete with that. It seems like he'd be a fool to stay."

StLouisRams,37j6j2,Daytwa313,7,Thu May 28 04:02:45 2015 UTC,that's exciting! yeah we basically replaced him with Nick fairley who is cheaper and probably a better pass rusher
StLouisRams,37j6j2,Bonecub,4,Thu May 28 04:14:44 2015 UTC,"We didn't entirely replace him, we have Brockers there.  It will be interesting to see who starts over they other between Fairley and Brockers.  My guess is that Brockers will start with Fairley rotating in on passing downs, but a couple weeks ago there was someone saying that Fairley is a better run stopper than Brockers as well.  We shall see!"
StLouisRams,37j6j2,One_Half_Hamster,2,Thu May 28 16:18:27 2015 UTC,towards the end of the year langford wasn't starting he was rotating with brockers and donald. fairley most likely be used the same way as a 3rd D tackle

StLouisRams,37j6p6,Opifex,0,Thu May 28 02:10:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This is all politicians trying to make names for themselves, let by one out-state (rural) politician who's constrained by term limits and wants to make himself viable as a candidate for state office by being against the grain. Just because a couple of legislators were overruled by the majority, and the governor, doesn't mean they'll get their way just by shouting ""lawsuit"".   Most of all, what they're objecting was already approved by the MO General Assembly (state legislature). They voted in the minority and lost. The issue was approved; they just don't want to stop talking about it.  Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
StLouisRams,37j6p6,SoulardSTL,4,Thu May 28 19:45:57 2015 UTC,"None of these items will singlehandedly derail a new stadium. However, with all the litigation from all angles, financial obstacles, and what appears to be a determination to move to LA from Kroenke, it is far from certain to be resolved by the end of the year. But the NFL will decide on the Rams relocating at the end of the season. Some reports suggest this will happen before the Super Bowl.   Between this uncertainty, and Kroenke's betrayal of STL fans, attendance will be bottom of the league this year, likely decreasing each week. Kroenke will use this as one more reason to relocate to LA. Additionally, if this eventually must go before voters, the soonest that could happen would be November, absent a special election.   But since STL moved so quickly (relatively speaking, in terms of bureaucracy) to come up with a stadium plans, especially compared to Oakland and San Diego, the loser of the LA sweepstakes stands a good chance at a fresh start in the Lou.   This is not my desire, but rather, my opinion of what I see happening. The NFL has rules and polices that govern these situations, but only to an extent. Kroenke is the second wealthiest owner in the NFL. And that is his money alone. His wife has a near equal net worth. He would be able to put up huge capital for litigation against the NFL if he had to. And could you imagine the media coverage of an NFL owner suing the league for anti trust issues? That would probably get Congress and/or prosecutors sniffing around. The other owners have to understand this, and would do whatever they could to prevent it, especially after the FIFA arrests today. They might not like Kroenke, his tactics, his refusal to play by the rules, and whatever else. They know that more harm than good could come from a Kroenke v National Football League case.   Feel free to downvote me for mentioning LA. That seems to be the state of this sub right now."

How long that takes is up for debate, but at this point I am becoming increasingly less optimistic each week that the Rams will play any football in St. Louis after this upcoming season.  As for this season, I agree as time goes on that attendance will decline.  The casual fans and corporate attendance will dry up.  The die-hards and true fans (myself included) will still go to the games, and it will probably feel like visiting a dying grandparent in the hospital.

StLouisRams,37dyqt,diesel321,3,Wed May 27 02:08:27 2015 UTC,Hopefully he's not full of shit and Greg makes big strides transitioning to the NFL game this year.
StLouisRams,37c3rk,bbbws,4,Tue May 26 15:13:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, what I like about this is that it shows a plan, a reasoning behind the pick and the subsequent ones, (OL was a glaring need)  If Gurley is the real deal and his injury heals, I can see him become the player Fisher wants him to be.   So it'll be a matter of waiting to see how he pans out."
StLouisRams,37c3rk,martinepinho,1 point,Tue May 26 16:16:40 2015 UTC,In sure someone has already answered this but when is Gurley expected to be able to play?
StLouisRams,37c3rk,grizwald85,7,Tue May 26 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"I forget who suggested it (maybe the Around the NFL guys) but they suggested that Gurley sits until week 7, which would be after the Rams bye week. I like this strategy because it gives Gurley plenty of time to heal and Tre Mason and Benny are more than capable of starting for the first 5 games."
StLouisRams,37c3rk,nhuff90,3,Tue May 26 20:37:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. We shouldn't get eager with him. If it takes him a full year to recover, that's fine. BTW I think it was on NFL total access that the week 7 thing was brought up in."
StLouisRams,37c3rk,thisbeareatsbacon,5,Tue May 26 22:38:56 2015 UTC,"What I like best about this plan is that if the line does take a while to gel, then tre and benny can take the pains of the learning process, and gurley can step in when they are better. (sorry tre and benny)"
StLouisRams,37c3rk,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,5,Wed May 27 02:24:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know the actual answer but going off of Bradford's first ACL tear, that was mid-late October and I believe he was ready for some/most of training camp?  Gurley tore his ACL in late November so if you stay on the course of 9-10 months it would be around August/September that he'll start to take more physical activity. I guess end of preseason would be a good aim for him to start taking reps in practice.  Of course a) I'm not a doctor and b) everyone heals differently so we'll see how it goes!"
StLouisRams,37c3rk,cariboustew28,3,Tue May 26 18:37:26 2015 UTC,That would be fantastic if that is the case. I was thinking mid season so any sooner would be awesome. Cant wait to see him play
StLouisRams,37c3rk,grizwald85,1 point,Tue May 26 18:45:06 2015 UTC,"We needed Bradford to be ready Week 1 though.  With Gurley, that is not the case.  I say we give him as much time as possible to heal/rehab.  I really also like the after bye week plan."
StLouisRams,37c3rk,ramSACKcity,2,Wed May 27 13:56:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree, but the original question was how long till he is ""able"" to play so I gave my best estimate. If we didn't roll out Gurley until after the bye I wouldn't be upset at all!"
StLouisRams,37c3rk,cariboustew28,2,Wed May 27 14:06:26 2015 UTC,"That is true, good point and agreed."
StLouisRams,37c3rk,ramSACKcity,1 point,Wed May 27 14:07:02 2015 UTC,I'm so sick of hearing about Trent Richardson.  Should teams never draft a QB in the first round too because of Jamarcus Russell or Ryan Leaf?
StLouisRams,378wc0,Kicker0fE1ves,12,Mon May 25 20:53:05 2015 UTC,"Try the Westin, Hyatt, and Drury.    The Westin is right next to BPV so if you want to watch some CFB on Saturday.  Hyatt is probably the nicest IMHO, it's heart of the city so you get a view of the Arch.  Drury is right by the stadium, we literally tailgate across the street from it."
StLouisRams,378wc0,MizzouR,8,Mon May 25 22:43:08 2015 UTC,I will up his recommendation for the Drury. The only place I stay when I head over for the game.

StLouisRams,378wc0,To3z,3,Mon May 25 23:33:18 2015 UTC,At one point Hilton at the ballpark was the team hotel the night before. You might set up shop downstairs early at breakfast and try to get some autographs.
StLouisRams,378wc0,MrMan98765,2,Tue May 26 01:35:58 2015 UTC,"Can't say I have, but it probably belongs on the list, the hotel competition keeps most of the hotels pretty nice"

It's not a great hotel, but if you're looking for something cheap it's good enough, it's where I stayed when I went out there. A lot of fans of both teams stay there and the bar was packed after the game, which led to some good fun between some Rams and 49ers fans."

It's not like Tulsa where you can go pretty much anywhere and be fine. There's  a donut around downtown that has the highest crime rates in the US.  Think North Tulsa x 50. There's some places that are gentrifying, but they don't have many hotel rooms.  The hill is an awesome place for dinner. Its a famous Italian historic district. Clayton is right by forest park and all the museums and attractions located within. The metrolink train runs until midnight. It will take you downtown and to Clayton. Leave your car at the hotel and commute in."

If I'm north of Apache I'm nervous. Worst place I've ever been to though was Camden, NJ around 2:00 A.M. back when the crime was as at an all time high.  Ahhh the Hill! I was trying to think of that area. I planned for that to be one of my stops when I intended to go last year. Thanks for the advice!"

StLouisRams,378wc0,ThickAsianAccent,5,Mon May 25 22:10:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on what kind experience you are looking for then. If you are there just for the game downtown around Washington Ave can be pretty cool, and as long as you don't stumble around at 1 AM on the street alone you should be just fine. If you want to drive around and enjoy the city a bit as well, then I would suggest somewhere around Forest Park or Washington University. Lots of museums and stuff and its not that far of a drive from the stadium. Generally speaking don't go north of the EJ Dome and don't cross the river and you should have a great time.   Source: I grew up near Edwardsville, IL and would take trips into the city often."
StLouisRams,378wc0,ThickAsianAccent,4,Mon May 25 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"I'm mainly there for the game, but I'm also looking to see the town. So far all I have planned though is getting some toasted ravioli, Ted Drewe's, and get some beer to take back home that I can't buy here (Oklahoma liquor laws are awful). I've heard Washington Ave. is pretty neat."
StLouisRams,37c8ls,Banditjack,-1,Tue May 26 15:47:19 2015 UTC,"With that, from what I've read and watched lately, doesn't look good for the Rams next year in the relocation talks.          Depends on your perspective. Some of us want the team to move. You have to scroll to the bottom of the pages in this sub to find us, but we're here...!"
StLouisRams,37c8ls,xKeyNin,1 point,Tue May 26 15:56:24 2015 UTC,"This looks like a pretty blatant attempt at a disguised ""Hey, Rams are moving here next year lol, no hard feelings tho guys. RamsBros. Also lol."""
StLouisRams,37c8ls,SoulardSTL,0,Tue May 26 17:00:47 2015 UTC,Wasn't my intention.  Just seeing all the news and seeing how both Raiders/Chargers are working towards their respective home town deals.  Most writers are talking as if the Rams are going for sure to L.A.   The intention is to welcome a team to the area. Since its a NFC/AFC split its not that big of a deal to cheer for the Rams.
StLouisRams,37c8ls,TheDuke13,1 point,Tue May 26 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"You know, it's one thing to say you empathize, and that you as a San Diego Chargers fan are in the same predicament. That would be welcome. But, to then pivot towards saying we're done and you're going to make it, that's at the very least poor conveyance of your thoughts in what you're writing. Quite simply, it reeks of passive-aggressiveness...   This is especially as the NFL Owners are more in line with Carson than Inglewood post-owners meeting (see: Spanos & Davis dining together with various owners, including 3 from the LA Commission). The land sale closed, and Carmen Policy's been hired to see that it's built. Meanwhile, San Diego's stadium offer to the Chargers includes financing that will likely be rejected by the League, all while the STL North Riverfront Stadium is being praised by Goodell, Grubman, and the other NFL executives. Everything else predicting the Rams are gone has panned out only to rumor and hearsay.   It's one thing to convey empathy and fraternity, as both our teams are at risk of relocating. It's another to say you'll happily take our place as fans of our team when you predict our efforts will die. Or are we not hearing you out like you'd like."
StLouisRams,37c8ls,SoulardSTL,1 point,Tue May 26 17:31:41 2015 UTC,Kroenke won't care. He'll move with or without approval. Just don't expect it to be a surprise.
StLouisRams,37c8ls,houseofpayne55,2,Tue May 26 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"If Carson is picked for the Chargers and Raiders, then Kroenke will not go rogue.   The Cost/Benefits are broken for him doing so. If he does, he first risks massive fines by the NFL and lawsuits for multiple violations of League rules. He'll also risk the League coming down on his cross-ownership of multiple Denver sports teams. Punitive relocation fees would top $1BB if he tries a ""Baltimore Colts"" relocation. He'll lose Super Bowl opportunities, lose his share of TV revenues, piss off all the other owners, and welcome a ""nuclear option"" such as de-scheduling. Also, if he tries anti-trust lawsuits, based on precedent from the 1982 Al Davis case (which likely won't pull true precedent today), the Rams will stay in STL until fully adjudicated.   I won't be surprised by anything these days, except for Kroenke going rogue and thinking he'll win."
StLouisRams,375pyo,Craciunator,48,Mon May 25 02:43:10 2015 UTC,"I just think most of us have realized we should probably stop over hyping every year, and just let the Rams play, we already know what they can do, it's the just question of them actually doing it."

Just a fun way to make the season go by faster."
StLouisRams,375pyo,diddlydoodly,2,Mon May 25 03:16:24 2015 UTC,"Most other NFL subreddits are more active simply because they've got more fans. The Rams don't have a huge fan base like some other teams, so there's just not as much people creating content on the subreddit."
StLouisRams,375pyo,The_Fad,9,Mon May 25 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"But we can at least be positive and show some love for our team, you make it sound like its not worth getting hyped about the team you love. I understand that weve been let down a lot the last few years, but if you cant get excited about your team then whats the point of being a fan?"
StLouisRams,375pyo,Vanscoten,3,Mon May 25 05:07:10 2015 UTC,"I said over hyping the team, I'm hyped about them Rams, no doubt. I'm just not getting in over my head, we've crashed to many hype trains."

StLouisRams,375pyo,price-iz-right,6,Mon May 25 04:42:28 2015 UTC,I mean ive been a fan for as long as ive followed football (probably like 16-17 years now) fell in love with the GSOT and never looked back. The way i look at it is that we got a new OC thats not shitennheimer and if we had a healthy bradford we wouldve been a playoff team last year. Just trying to get somethinf going for this sub since its basically dead in the offseason and it makes me sad.
StLouisRams,375pyo,Pike09,1 point,Mon May 25 05:10:26 2015 UTC,"If we had an o line worth a damn and our defense got their shit together before the 6th game we'd have been a playoff team last year. I still hold that as the sole reason. Davis and Hill were serviceable considering our situation. Shittenheimer made some bad calls, but overall it was the O line and a slow season start defensively that fucked us.  That's both a good thing and a bad thing.  Good because, compared to our previous season blunders, an o line is a simple fix and we can develop moving forward. Our d will only be better out the gate this year if opposing offenses take us for granted (which they probably won't but how do you adjust against that d line?!?!?)  Bad because yet again we are left on a question mark with a whole new o line this year. They could be just as bad and we go nowhere again this year. They could be average and we might make some magic happen. Or they could be good/great and we start stomping teams out of no where.   We just don't know yet."

StLouisRams,375pyo,mcthsn,4,Mon May 25 05:11:50 2015 UTC,Why are you guys so high on our receivers?
StLouisRams,375pyo,price-iz-right,3,Mon May 25 13:35:48 2015 UTC,I think it's because they've had a backup throwing to them for the majority of the last 2 seasons so now people are excited to see a legitimate starter throwing them the football.
StLouisRams,375pyo,mcthsn,1 point,Mon May 25 17:32:12 2015 UTC,I suppose that is fair.
StLouisRams,375pyo,pmm2428,2,Mon May 25 23:09:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you look at our receiver set from the last time Bradford was throwing to them and now they have improved tremendously.   I remember them dropping balls constantly no more than 2-3 years ago. As of last year the least of our offensive woes were dropped balls.   Our receivers are not bad at all, and I think it will show if our O line steps it up this year. We got a healthy QB with a good arm and a strong run game to give our receivers some room on the play action.   I think Quick and Bailey are going to be surprising people this year."

StLouisRams,36rvqd,One_Half_Hamster,14,Thu May 21 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"Will Austin play a running back-receiver hybrid role, with Stedman Bailey as the No. 3 receiver?   I think this will be more likely - Austin can take the lid off of defenses (if used properly, which I have yet to see too much of), but Bailey is the better, more consistent receiver with great hands."
StLouisRams,36rvqd,corbilm,-1,Thu May 21 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"He's just a smaller quicker Faulk, so he leans more on the verge of WR than RB."
StLouisRams,36rvqd,CplPJ,10,Wed May 27 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"Biggest worry looking at this list: Our C, RG, and RT (entire right/middle of our line) are all starting from scratch essentially. That does not excite me for a strong start with our offense.  Most exciting thing: Janoris and McLeod are our weakest spots on defense. I'm the least worried about our defense that I ever have been as a Rams fan, and that makes me giddy."
StLouisRams,36rvqd,Cloud324,1 point,Thu May 21 20:10:36 2015 UTC,"Well, we can't really get much worse at C, and anyone should be an upgrade over Joseph at RG.  Honestly though, I predict that Saffold gets put on the right side, to help the two new pieces at C and RT and then Robinson and probably Brown just bulldoze people on the left side.  I'm less worried about any one spot on the O-Line compared to what the whole Line can do against the pass rush.  Heres to hoping they are able to keep Foles on his feet."
StLouisRams,36rvqd,porkfish66,5,Sat May 23 09:57:33 2015 UTC,"God that OL is such a wild card. Outside of Saffold, they have 16 starts between them. I have a feeling things are gonna start out pretty rough for us on the offensive side of the ball."
StLouisRams,36rvqd,bozo7337,5,Thu May 21 18:02:53 2015 UTC,I would wager Barnes has a better chance to not be on the roster than being the starter.
StLouisRams,36rvqd,Sauceman87,4,Thu May 21 17:47:05 2015 UTC,I'd rather see Saffold on the right side so we don't have two rookies and 3 new faces on the right half of the line.

StLouisRams,36r6ng,One_Half_Hamster,3,Thu May 21 15:27:08 2015 UTC,I completely agree.
StLouisRams,36r6ng,rloftis6,3,Thu May 21 18:10:00 2015 UTC,"I'll say what I said in the /r/NFL thread....  The comeback from injury is a question mark, but assuming he comes back right. I really think he will regain that momentum! Right now our WR corps doesn't deserve much credit. However, Kenny Britt really helped out everyone as a mentor. I think we are going to have an underrated WR corp that will do well next year and more. Britt and Quick at ends, Stedman slot receiver, and Tavon the wild card. Plus there won't be too much pressure on them with the running game, which makes it easier."
StLouisRams,36r6ng,ramSACKcity,2,Thu May 21 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"So much is riding on our giant question mark of an o line. We need big Greg to improve at LT, we've got rookies at LG and RT, a first year starter in Barret Jones at center. If these guys don't show up big everyone on offense is going to struggle"
StLouisRams,36r6ng,frankoftank,2,Thu May 21 19:23:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, that definitely is a given.  I agree, our offense is made or broke by our OL."
StLouisRams,36r6ng,ramSACKcity,3,Thu May 21 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, Saffold got his shoulder fixed and should be 100% again, and there's no way Jones and Brown can be worse than wells and Joseph.... I hope."
StLouisRams,36r6ng,frankoftank,2,Thu May 21 19:43:56 2015 UTC,I think the entire receiving corp stands to benefit from Foles at QB and an even stronger backfield. Whether Quick can distinguish himself as the top receiver again remains to be seen.
StLouisRams,36r6ng,mateoelgigante,1 point,Thu May 21 18:49:23 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be able to. He brings to the table a set of skills that I don't think the other wideouts can easily replace, and in particular his ability to operate in traffic with his size"
StLouisRams,36r6ng,bigDean636,1 point,Thu May 21 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, the bar for QB play has been set pretty low in St. Louis."
StLouisRams,36r6ng,SoulardSTL,2,Thu May 21 18:53:20 2015 UTC,"Not just Quick, but the whole receiving corps should have a substantial increase in quality performances this year. With significant investments into the QBs and across our O-Line, including beefing up our rushing attack, we should finally be able to see these WR assets able to capitalize on a little normalcy in the rest of the offense. And so long as Quick's injuries have legitimately healed, he could end up a solid receiver. If Gurley and Mason can distract the opposing teams' attention, Quick could also end up open more often than before. Good times."
StLouisRams,36r6ng,SoulardSTL,2,Thu May 21 19:48:11 2015 UTC,"Things are definitely looking up for the Rams. Their defense has been fairly good these past few seasons, and now the offense is young and trending in the right direction.  It also helps that San Francisco is absolutely falling apart in the NFC West, but I digress..."

The entire situation screams of a lack of leadership by the NFL. Kroenke, currently, is violating the NFL's cross-ownership rules. But with that said, if the Rams are headed to L.A., are the Raiders headed to St. Louis because the city and the state of Missouri seem to have a stadium plan. Oakland? Not so much. San Diego? Again, this could be a repeat of the mess the NFL went through in the 1990s. For the city of St. Louis to lose a team twice in my lifetime just screams of dysfunction within the league's hierarchy."

Removing the variable of supernatural intervention, I can see the League voting that the Rams not relocate for failure of ownership to abide by League rules and failing to fulfill the prerequisite elements allowing for relocation.   What if Carson is selected by both teams? The NFL won't let 2 stadiums be built with 3 teams in the same market.   If the Raiders are done with Oakland, would the League let them come south?   Would the Chargers continue to be viable if there are 2 teams in LA? Hard to say, and risky enough to not let 3 teams play within 100 miles of each other in SoCal."
StLouisRams,36o61j,eight26,-5,Thu May 21 19:53:59 2015 UTC,St Louis can't make Uncle Rico chip in for the stadium. There simply is not enough money to build in St Louis.
StLouisRams,36o61j,thatoneguy889,0,Wed May 20 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"That's not the issue. The issue is that the NFL can keep the Rams in STL.   You are right that the Rams can play in the North Riverfront Stadium, or they can play in the Edward Jones Dome, with the option lying to team owners to contribute. This is just as valid as that Kroenke can sell the team, or he can stay as owner. Both are his call. What would he want to do? If Kroenke stays in STL, whether he plays in the EJD or the North Riverfront Stadium, it's his call.   As for money in STL... We're a monied city, but no way in fuck would we 100% fund 2 new NFL stadiums in 20 years. We have $400MM ready to go, and that's good enough for anyone.   Addn: Just had to google ""Uncle Rico"". I guess Kroenke does look like the guy in Napoleon Dynamite. But personally, I think he's more like Jed Clampett, a wannabe Beverly Hillbilly redneck from the Ozarks who got rich making Wal-Mart strip malls."
StLouisRams,36o61j,thatoneguy889,2,Wed May 20 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"I don't follow how the NFL can make him stay. I haven't read the original contract nor am I a lawyer, but as I understand it, if the EJD (or any stadium) isn't top tier, then he can move. The city's position seems to be, ""You'll have a top tier stadium as soon as you help build it. So you have to stay.""  That seems like circular logic."
StLouisRams,36o61j,eight26,-1,Wed May 20 21:50:34 2015 UTC,"Simple contract law. You want to own an NFL team, then you must play by the NFL's rules...   Here's an assessment of the League's laws for relocation. And the League has said they'll follow their own rules.   Quite simply, the Rams have a viable market already: Saint Louis. The team hasn't played by the League's rules, hasn't reached out to their market other than to sell tickets, has produced an inferior product, and are not able to relocate just on the basis of increased private valuation of the franchise. Not only have they not achieved the minimum elements necessary for relocation, but Kroenke remains in outstanding violation of League rules."
StLouisRams,36o61j,Wm_TheConqueror,3,Wed May 20 22:01:09 2015 UTC,"Regardless of if it's agreed to or not, a contract is unenforceable if it breaks the law to begin with. The outcome of the Al Davis lawsuit in the '80s determined that the league blocking a team from moving violates federal antitrust laws.   So Kroenke could announce that they're moving tomorrow and if the league moves to stop it, he could take them to court on the grounds that they're impeding his ability to do business, cite the Davis case as precedent, and he will win. That's basically what Frontiere threatened to do when she moved the team to STL in the first place and they backed off before it got filed."
StLouisRams,36o61j,CJW1215,0,Thu May 21 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"However, the Al Davis antitrust case did not produce precedent stating that the agreements inherent to the NFL’s franchising of teams, nor the management of these franchises under the whole of the League itself, are in any way unlawful. Just stating that the Al Davis case means precedent for any team to move any time, otherwise it’s a hindrance of business, is not a valid interpretation of case law. Further, amendments to these League rules have so far been fully proven legal and have not been questioned beforehand. Of course, Kroenke can take the issue to court, but it’s not a given at all that the Al Davis case means easy precedent for a theoretical Kroenke case, if in fact he decides to contest these issues.   Since no one has contested the League’s post-Al Davis rulings on these issues, it is way too far premature for anyone to assume they know how a court will act. It is unproven precedent as it would be applied in far different circumstances. To say you know how the court will rule here, with so much certainty, is completely unfounded.   Remember that Kroenke owns a franchise within a larger association, that he agreed to abide by the League’s rules when he bought in, and that these rules have never been questioned in this nature before."
StLouisRams,36o61j,Mister_Dane,2,Fri May 22 17:13:01 2015 UTC,"the Al Davis antitrust case did not produce precedent stating that the agreements inherent to the NFL’s franchising of teams, nor the management of these franchises under the whole of the League itself, are in any way unlawful.   Again, contracts are unenforceable if the matter in question is illegal regardless of if it's agreed to or not.   If I sign a contract agreeing to buy cocaine from one dealer, but decide to buy another one instead, the first dealer cannot sue me for breach of contract because the sale of cocaine is illegal to begin with.   The Al Davis lawsuit found that blocking a team from moving is equivalent to colluding to prevent a business from entering an open market which violates federal antitrust laws. The NFL can change its rules and procedures all it wants, but as much as they might want to, they cannot invalidate the law.   The reason no one has contested these post-Davis rulings is because it hasn't been an issue since then. The most controversial moves after that were when the Browns relocated to Baltimore (which happened with relatively little protest from the league) and the Rams relocating to St. Louis. The NFL was so opposed to Frontiere moving the team that it actually got to the point that they voted on it. All she did was threaten the league with a lawsuit and the Commissioner gave in.  Belonging to an association and agreeing to it's rules means nothing if those rules are illegal to begin with. If Kroenke moves the team and the NFL attempts to block it, he will sue, and he will win. It's as simple as that. The league's only recourse in that case would be to terminate the entire team, but  the chance of that happening is so low it's practically a negative number."
StLouisRams,36o61j,Wm_TheConqueror,1 point,Fri May 22 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"When I was in law school, I didn’t spend all my time in Contracts focusing on antitrust laws, so I should assume you may have something I may have missed. But again, as no case law has been realized subsequent to the 1982 ruling, there’s only so much that can be said by anyone.   What I contend still holds: Kroenke bought a franchise of a larger association and in doing so agreed to abide by the regulations of that association, including all elements of relocation.  He can choose to fight it in court, but either of us being able to say, with certainty, the ramifications of the Al Davis case contrasted to the League’s regulations today are not known. I question your statements of certainty how the courts would rule in this hypothetical case because they are stated in terms of absolutes.   Also, remember that the Raiders continued to play in Oakland while the Al Davis case was heard. Should the NFL rule that the Rams will stay in STL and Kroenke files suit, we can assume that it would be adjudicated while the Rams remain in STL. If he tries to pull a “Baltimore Colts” on the NFL, they’ll fine him to hell and back. If he tries to pull a “Seahawks to LA”, he’ll recognize fines of at least $500K like they were ready to assess upon Ken Behring in the mid-90s.   More than likely, the threat of the expenses of a lawsuit, both in capital and public relations, will likely keep a suit from ever taking place."

StLouisRams,36o61j,Magnemmike,1 point,Wed May 20 22:12:05 2015 UTC,"One of the big emphasis points in local news today is ticket sales for the upcoming season, that if the local market purchases tickets strongly then it will emphasize to the League that the market is a sound consumer of its product. This could be difficult noting the isolation felt by much of the fan base with the team noncommittal, the ""lame duck"" market potential and all. That, and having not had a winning record in 11 straight seasons, including the worst 5-year run in NFL history. We've loved our loser, but of course we'd prefer a winner.   It would also be good to consider the difference herein between ""viable"" and ""optimal"". It is resoundingly clear that LA would consume more luxury boxes than STL, but STL has been a solid consumer of the product, even when it was inferior product compared to our competition (11 losing seasons)."

StLouisRams,36o0kb,Chillinthamost,7,Wed May 20 20:03:19 2015 UTC,"Grubman's the League's guy assessing all the new stadiums: STL, San Diego, Oakland, Carson, and Inglewood. His voice carries a lot of weight. He says Oakland is falling behind, San Diego needs to work on their end more, and that STL is doing solid work.   Grubman's there so the League owners don't have to do their own fact-finding. His praise for STL means a lot for STL's efforts."
StLouisRams,36o0kb,Chillinthamost,4,Wed May 20 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"Got it, so essentially this guy has a lot of influence over owners' opinions on whether a relocation is justified."

StLouisRams,36s6kt,bozo7337,8,Thu May 21 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"Canadian fan here. I don't honestly know how I feel about this. I mean, practically speaking, the move doesn't affect me at all, and if anything, I'm more likely to go vacation in LA and catch a game than go to St. Louis. That said though, I'm still hoping they don't move. I'll be really sad if they do, for reasons that are unclear even to me. I've become so invested in the players, history, and inner workings of the team that I'll still root for them wherever they are as long as they're the Rams, but seeing them ripped from (what I grew up seeing as) their natural home will be hard for me."
StLouisRams,36s6kt,BrawndoTTM,3,Thu May 21 21:59:22 2015 UTC,"As a Des Moines fan, I feel exactly how you feel.  I have no idea what I'd do if they were to move, I don't want to cheer for another team, but also Fuck Stan."
StLouisRams,36s6kt,tylerseher,5,Fri May 22 02:21:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a St. Louis fan, if the Rams moved to LA, I would cheer for the Rams (kinda) and wait for another NFL team to move to St. Louis (doubtful that happens). But I'll be really salty and butt hurt if this move goes down."

I liked them in LA, Like them now in STL, and would like them if they moved to Canada. I just hope that the name wouldn't change like the Sonics did. I got into this debate before on Facebook about who was a team fan and who was a city fan. just like the Rams lost some fans in LA in the 90s they would lose fans in STL if they moved this time."
StLouisRams,36s6kt,thisbeareatsbacon,5,Thu May 21 21:08:13 2015 UTC,"For me, I was a Rams fan when they were in LA. I followed them to STL, and I would follow them back to LA."

Personally, I'd mourn losing the Rams, greatly. I've invested my support in this team for years, and so have many others. The team does have a history in California, but it also has its history here, as well as its presence & existence today. It's in STL where we've cheered our team winning Super Bowl 34 and have endured the subsequent collapse, yet kept attending and cheering. And, we've flat-out been treated like shit by Kroenke, but we've kept supporting our team.   Honestly, I'm both a Saint Louis fan and a Rams fan. It's hard to keep loving someone who leaves you."

The WHOLE Sonics team left, not one or two players.   If Robert Quinn left you are right I wouldnt stop being a Rams fan. If the Rams and some other team swapped whole Defenses including coaches, I just might switch teams."

StLouisRams,36s6kt,SoulardSTL,2,Fri May 22 17:14:29 2015 UTC,This happens gradually over time regardless.   And that makes it a totally different situation than the one we are discussing. When it happens gradually you gradually grow attachments to the new players as the old ones slowly shuffle out.
StLouisRams,36s6kt,chemicalpoisons,1 point,Fri May 22 17:37:44 2015 UTC,"Play the card. My answer is no, I don't cheer for the Thunder. However, I don't have a team to root for in the sport at all anymore. It would be like the Rams going to LA, and changing name and logo. Don't think it's quite the same. I'm asking, if the Rams left, kept the logo and name, then, St Louis acquired another team, who would you root for? It's a fucked up question, but it's not the same for everyone, so I don't think the Sonics analogy applies here. Do you like the Rams bcz Rams? Or do you like the Rams bcz STL?"
StLouisRams,36s6kt,CplPJ,2,Thu May 21 20:57:04 2015 UTC,"For the record, I didn't like playing that card. Go Sounders.  You're asking me something that I've lived through before: the relocation of the AZ Cardinals. I never was a hardcore Cardiac Cardinals fan, since my family aligned more with the Bears, but I did cheer for our hometown losing team. When Bill Bidwell took the team to Glendale AZ, it hurt for years. A lot of people in STL still cheer for the AZ Cardinals, especially when Kurt Warner threw for them. Still, I was so upset with Bill Bidwell that I still say his name in vein. It was never the team, never the players, that had me so mad, but I knew as a kid that the one man who took the team from us was Bill Bidwell. I only now begrudgingly not curse the desert now that Bidwell's son is now the operational leader of the team, and that Bill is little more than a figurehead.   Today, I am a dedicated fan to my Rams, and I am livid at having to face them possibly being taken. Having lived through the good times and the completely abominable past decade, I hate the prospect of them leaving because Kroenke wants to increase his own private wealth by taking them to LA. I'll cheer for the team, the players, the history, the growth of the team, and be supportive. That said, I would despise Stan Kroenke and everything he stands for. I would not consume anything from the Rams again because I wouldn't want him to make a dollar off of it.   Even Bill Bidwell has said Kroenke's being an asshole.   Better answer: I would cheer for a LA Rams team that did not have Stan Kroenke as owner."
StLouisRams,36s6kt,FoxyZach,3,Fri May 22 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"One major reason I picked the Rams as my team (other than it was the first team, prior to the Broncos, that I was exposed to), was because they were from St. Louis. As an early teenager, I was a big WWE fan, and an even bigger Randy Orton fan (still a fan of him to this day). So, I was in love with St. Louis from when I was 13, cause I loved the name and the city.  I don't know what I will do if they move; I always spill tears at the '99 Superbowl run. Rams are a part of my heart. But they are more so because they are from STL..."
StLouisRams,36s6kt,M3rc_Nate,2,Thu May 21 19:35:46 2015 UTC,"I live in Nebraska (born in St. Louis, but very shortly moved here), so I can't say I really have the hometown attachment in the way local St. Louisans do.  I root for all STL teams, and love the Rams even more than my Huskers. But, IMO, a team and even sports fandom in general, is simply what you make of it, and I intend to support the Rams in LA or STL (granted, I'd rather they stay), simply because I've come to love rooting for them and to me as a non-native of STL, them moving to a city I also won't be in won't affect my dedication."

I dont know if i misheard but i thought i heard there was also the possibility of the Raiders moving up to St Louis (assuming Rams and Chargers move to LA to share a stadium).   IF that happened id be very curious to see what the Missouri natives and Rams fans would do/think. You'd have ""your"" team in LA (Rams), and you'd have a new team in St. Louis. Who do you root for?"
StLouisRams,36s6kt,TerminusEst86,4,Thu May 21 20:53:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like I would probably root for the rams for the first few years and transition to becoming a raiders fan. I really enjoy going to the games, so for that reason I would end up becoming a raiders fan (sadly)"
StLouisRams,36s6kt,Magnemmike,1 point,Thu May 21 21:47:01 2015 UTC,This is what i would expect and i get it. It also makes sense because by then (in a few years) a lot of the Rams guys will probably have left and it will feel mainly like a new team. You probably wouldn't be feeling to bad though because the Raiders are looking up with Carr and their other additions. If they had done better getting a solid RB in FA or the draft i could see them being a 8-8 or better team. But with Trent Richardson i think the best they can do is 8-8.

StLouisRams,36s6kt,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Sat May 23 13:21:09 2015 UTC,"Time to be unpopular!        I am a Rams fan, and though I live much closer to StL than to LA, I am a proponent of them moving. Here's why:         Someone is going to move to LA. That's just a fact. Expansion would be a bad idea - the 2010 NFC West and 2014 NFC South showed us the league is already too watered down. And there's clearly an imminent desire for a team to go there. And I'll be glad when a team does, simply because it will hamstring the ability of greedy owners to use it as leverage against their cities. So, if someone has to move to LA, it should be us because: -- We have 50 years of history there and an existing fanbase. -- St. Louis would miss the team less less than any other. I know, I know, this subreddit is full of St. Louis fans who would miss them plenty. But the fact is that this subreddit is not representative of either St. Louis or Rams fans in general. Every Rams forum I'm subscribed to other than this one is heavily pro-LA, and the attendance shows - particularly in the dominance of visiting fans at our home games - that the Rams are just not that popular in St. Louis. If the Rams leave, mark my words - they'll be forgotten in St. Louis in five years by all but a handful. Being in a marquee city can potential help us in attracting big-name free agents, and keeping the ones we have. Somelike, say, Jenkins will be far more enticed to resign with us if we're in LA, and I suspect that this will be the case for many free agents.   All right, guys, do your worst."

StLouisRams,36s5q7,Magnemmike,6,Thu May 21 18:11:40 2015 UTC,"That's the exact opposite of what I've heard. The League is considering a new meeting in August to discuss the North Riverfront Stadium in STL. At that time, it is believed all financing should be hammered out on our end. Should that be, then the meeting would be held in validation of the STL Stadium Task Force and be a confidence vote on whether or not to break ground here.   Concurrently, this meeting would be after both the Oakland and San Diego proposals would have been duly considered and updating the ownership to these developments' viability (San Diego's came out Monday, Oakland's comes out 6/21). Generally, it would be whether or not they are going to build in their home markets or move forward with relocation to Carson.   With respect to your source, it sounds like just a rumor on a local news channel. Any other sources to back it up?"
StLouisRams,36s5q7,SoulardSTL,-3,Thu May 21 18:27:57 2015 UTC,"Nothing yet,  as the announcement from the NFL is supposed to be in August.  So unless the NFL is pressed to speak (not likely) we will have to wait until August"
StLouisRams,36s5q7,SoulardSTL,6,Thu May 21 18:32:16 2015 UTC,"I've done writings on economic development initiatives for a number of years, and the rule of thumb for stories has generally been that 3 validating sources are needed to authenticate a story if it doesn't come directly from the subject. Right now, you'll understand if I think this rumor dubious at best, not out of this stupid partisan fanship the Rams now have, but out of not having credibility yet.   It also just seems really out there as well that the League would witness a relocation attempt right at the very start of the 2015 season, and coming out right when the team is selling season tickets. Unless they're trying to torpedo their own ship, cutting their own nose to spite their own face, this just doesn't make sense, know what I mean?"
StLouisRams,36s5q7,SoulardSTL,-4,Thu May 21 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"With the exception of stan saying they are leaving,  how much proof do you need?   He's building a stadium in inglewood!!"
StLouisRams,36s5q7,SCRx,2,Thu May 21 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"Wrong. ""Silent Stan"" has technically not committed.   What he has said is that he'll break ground at the end of the year. He also has said that he'll abide by the League's ruling, whichever way it goes.   It's obvious he wants to be in LA and is doing the prep work, but quite simply he hasn't actually said that he's going to relocate the Rams. What if he's denied relocation? That's why ground hasn't been broken, no use building a stadium when you're not able to relocate your team there, and he'd have to start development all over again when he turns Inglewood into apartments. Fucker couldn't even build a Wal-Mart there before.   how much proof do you need?   Let's start with a very simple statement from Kroenke, or even Demoff, confirming what you wrote."
StLouisRams,36s5q7,SCRx,3,Thu May 21 19:35:43 2015 UTC,Except he's not.  Show me one picture of building taking place.  He owns the land and could start to build but he isn't currently.  At earliest he'd break ground in December.

StLouisRams,36k4k9,SoulardSTL,1 point,Wed May 20 00:59:38 2015 UTC,"Carson is getting closer to Inglewood as being shovel-ready for development. Carson has hired Carmen Policy to oversee its development (former head of 49ers in their prime, then of the Browns when they returned to the League; oversaw Santa Clara's stadium development). The land has been bought by the teams, then title was passed along to the new Carson municipal stadium authority. CA State environmental group has said the grounds are satisfactory for use as a stadium. And, Goldman Sachs has allocated $1.7BB in municipal bond funding to Carson so the stadium can be built.   Meanwhile, Oakland is nowhere near the Coliseum City plans coming together. San Diego offered up their new stadium proposal, but there are questions on whether or not the Chargers will take it; it may be more sound fiscally to play in Carson, even without considering private value appreciation. Of the 3 home markets, STL is considered by many to have created the best proposal, with Eric Grubman crediting all that has been done in STL during his presentation to the NFL franchise owners yesterday."

They drafted  o-linemen  and now it's time to put all the time, effort, and hard work into coaching them for the upcoming season. I know I sound harsh but it was time to move on, best of luck to him."
StLouisRams,36ikhg,TweetPoster,4,Tue May 19 20:43:52 2015 UTC,Agree! Joe was a decent RT but he was a good run blocker and a poor pass blocker. Kinda sounds like what we drafted so lets give the rookie the playing time in camp and let him develop. Joe's been the same his entire NFL career or worse. Not a huge loss.
StLouisRams,36ikhg,pantherfanalex,2,Tue May 19 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"I'm still confused by this. The radio guys said that before the draft Barksdale was offered 3.5-4million a year for four years, but he wanted 8million a year and decided to test the market. I guess the Rams withdrew the offer??  He needs to fire his agent."

StLouisRams,36fwnn,Magnemmike,3,Tue May 19 01:57:04 2015 UTC,I think it comes down to whether they really want to put out the $300 Mill that was proposed.
StLouisRams,36fwnn,Thonked,1 point,Tue May 19 17:11:16 2015 UTC,"Also, what the League as a whole thinks of the offer will play heavily. The owners are talking about this in San Francisco right now.   Here's the full proposal from CSAG, with additional renderings.  We can look at this as the opening proposal. I have read some articles that discussed ""hidden"" costs in the proposal that the Chargers likely won't agree to, and these elements could be up for debate later between the Chargers and the CSAG. Guess we'll find out as things play forward."
StLouisRams,36fwnn,SoulardSTL,6,Tue May 19 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"Why is it that the Chargers can make all kinds of demands, reject proposals, and do whatever they want, whereas the Rams have to accept anything and everything that St. Louis comes up with? I never understood why the line of thinking is different between both cities."
StLouisRams,36fwnn,Seductive_Santa,0,Tue May 19 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"The Rams have been consulted to by the STL Stadium Task Force. I'm not sure if you remember, but the renderings for the North Riverfront Stadium were amended in March after talking face-to-face with the Rams, not with Kroenke, but with COO Kevin Demoff. Changes to the plans included non-structural issues, such as scoreboards and the designs of locker rooms & luxury boxes, done at the team's behest.   Meanwhile, the STL Stadium Task Force has invited Kroenke to further participate, which he has publicly rejected. It's not that Kroenke's being expected to just take whatever is being prepared, it's that Kroenke has chosen to not be a factor in any of these conversations.   This is the difference from San Diego. Spanos and Fabiani are at least talking. Meanwhile, he's still Silent Stan.  Rather than sit on their hands in the face of Kroenke's silence, the Task Force went back to work, presenting to the NFL instead of Kroenke because this is a League issue more than just a fiscal opportunity for one owner. In the absence of Kroenke, the Task Force is taking direction from the League. Eric Grubman presented the STL updates yesterday, noting STL is accomplishing rather well and in line with his expectations.   In all this, the North Riverfront Stadium will only come together with a partner, i.e. the Rams (Kroenke). He could in fact choose to stay in STL and build something different than what's being prepared today. What's important is not the design itself, but the participation. After all, if the Chargers and Raiders are going to LA, but not the Rams, will we keep playing in the Edward Jones Dome or someplace new?"
StLouisRams,36fwnn,SoulardSTL,3,Wed May 20 16:23:16 2015 UTC,"Hasn't Demoff be involved with the whole process? You can't reference Fabiani and then pretend that Kroenke doesn't have people to do his bidding as well. Granted, I'll agree it's a dick move that Kroenke hasn't even acknowledged you guys, regardless of what his intentions are in the end, but there's been some degree of organizational involvement.   I understand the progress that's been made in St. Louis, but there's been progress in San Diego too, and both seem to be able to piece together a financing package. My question has been the difference in dialogue regarding both cities. San Diego comes up with a plan? Oh, Spanos will just reject it and move anyway. St. Louis comes up with a plan? Well, Stan is going to have to stay no matter what.  The point is, with both cities making significant progress, the league will be more free to chose an LA stadium based on merit, rather than which home market has worked the hardest. Time will tell."
StLouisRams,36fwnn,Seductive_Santa,0,Wed May 20 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"I do agree that, generally speaking, Fabiani is to Spanos as Demoff is to Kroenke. They're the face guys in the public, keeping the public from the owners while presenting the owners' thoughts where applicable, or present.   The larger dynamics are much different. In San Diego, it's been the Franchise reaching out to the Local Government to get a deal going, and after 15 years SD's Local Government is finally producing work, maybe too late. In Saint Louis, it's been the Local Government (CVC/RSA, Task Force, etc.) that's been reaching out to the Franchise but have been denied conversations time and again. Other than the arbitration, there's been no contact between the Rams Organization and any local government entity.   Demoff has been somewhat involved in the North Riverfront Stadium process, but I'm not sure if it's been for the whole process. But compared to the Chargers, their entire approaches have been completely different. Spanos has always maintained that they want a workable solution for the Chargers in San Diego. Lies or not, he stands on his word. Kroenke hasn't spoken to Saint Louis or Rams fans since before buying the fucking team in April 2010. Kroenke had Demoff sit in on the LA Commission meetings in NY last April, but you can be sure he has Demoff making the pitch to the NFL owners in San Francisco today on Inglewood.   Kroenke won't take calls from the STL Mayor, or even the MO Governor, hasn't for years. Think about that.   Looking ahead, consider what would happen if the Rams are denied moving to LA. They'd be in STL. Would Kroenke want to continue as the Rams owner in STL? Or would he want to sell the team at that time? If someone new comes in as a prospective new owner, I bet they'd want to see a new stadium opportunity they can capitalize upon. Maybe we should look at the North Riverfront Stadium as the new owner option more than as the Kroenke option in STL."
StLouisRams,36fwnn,SoulardSTL,1 point,Wed May 20 17:54:27 2015 UTC,"Well fuck, I'm from California and I think Kroenke is a shitbag, even if it does mean my team comes back. Hi disregard for the STL market is unfortunate and disrespectful, regardless of how committed to LA he likely is. I just don't know how that will bode in terms of keeping the Rams, or eventually attracting another NFL franchise.  San Diego's plan is too late in the same regard that St. Louis' might be, in the respect that both owners may already be committed to LA. Both plans are viable and are a victim of bad timing. Both have acted as leverage for SD and STL to move their plans along more quickly than they would have otherwise.  I just want to warn you that locally here, the general consensus is that Kroenke will be the guy building his stadium. Don't give up hope that the Ram will stay, but Kroenke is gonna make LA happen in some capacity."
StLouisRams,36fwnn,Seductive_Santa,0,Wed May 20 18:21:02 2015 UTC,"We’re all passionate, and we all want to cheer for our teams. I dig how many in LA still love the Rams, just as many in STL still cheer for the AZ Cardinals (who I wrote off to hell when they relocated).   Here’s my general thoughts… The League has wanted an inter-California solution for LA this whole time, likely the Raiders, maybe the Chargers, and maybe expansion. They used the threat of “relocation” to get Minnesota, Atlanta, Buffalo, Seattle, etc. to pony up and get giant stadiums built. LA was still busted, losing out on an LA-designated franchise that became the Houston Texans. The League claimed the market themselves and almost bought land to plan their eventual return, land that Davis had wanted to buy, and land that Kroenke now owns (after not being able to get a Wal-Mart built there).  I think Kroenke has been planning his blitzkrieg into the LA market for years just to make bank. He knew the League wanted to bring an existing team back to LA, and he wanted to get ahead of it to cash in with first-mover advantage. He also knew that STL was about to present to him the plans for the new outdoor stadium at the beginning of the year (now the North Riverfront Stadium), and he announced Inglewood before those meetings could take place. He timed the Inglewood announcements so he could take Saint Louis, San Diego, Oakland, and the entire NFL by surprise, hoping to get in first and claim the entire market under his franchise’s banner. Only begrudgingly has he considered amending Inglewood to house two teams, and neither Spanos nor Davis want to have to partner up with him (also why Carson is almost a “merger of equals” while Inglewood is “beggar-thy-neighbor” economics).   Recognize as well that Kroenke has 70% of the team but still has to claim the remaining 30% from Chip Rosenbloom and his sister, Lucia Rodrigues, at some future date. I think the Rosenbloom kids, both of whom live in LA, have a big number in front of Kroenke to pay them some set amount. Kroenke likely decided to kill the STL market, claim hardship, relocate to LA, and pay off the Rosenbloom kids from his new earnings, making them rich while he gets richer through relocation. He may have been overly confident.   The Chargers and Raiders have stadiums in far worse condition than STL, but Rams fans have had it far worse than either Chargers or Raiders fans have had it. I really do feel that Kroenke has wanted to destroy the fan base here so he could just up and relocate back to LA. Seriously, it takes real effort to not have a winning season in eleven straight years. Still, we go to the games and endure bullshit organization management.   I’m not questioning at all the love for Rams fans still in LA. Same time, I hope everyone sees that Rams fans in STL have been eating shit for years and are being treated like garbage. Just because a guy from the middle of the fucking Ozarks gets rich building strip malls for his wife’s family does not mean he can just go all Jed Clampett and move the STL Rams to fucking Inglewood and think he’s a Hollywood hero. He’s a piece of shit that not even his family can stand.   For decades, the NFL leveraged “LA relocation” as a threat for new stadiums to be built. Kroenke now wants to relocate despite a new $1BB stadium, and despite CA teams actually needing to relocate. He is the chickens coming home to roost.  Seductive_Santa, and that's one hell of a name: Beware Stan Kroenke. Should LA get our Rams, he will be worse than Al Davis on a meth bender. You can expect him to fuck with the highways, light rail, and all other infrastructure, all on the taxpayer's dime, and all so he can make everyone park in oversize garages. Check the Hollywood Park plans; there's no tailgating. This then forces everyone into chain restaurants around the Hollywood Park development. By the time he's done, he'll make LA Live's commercialism look as quaint and organic as the south of France, all while charging $20 for large beers. He doesn't want fans; he wants consumers. He paints a picture that looks like the Guggenheim but is really what he knows best: Wal-Mart. And he doesn't care if the team wins, only that he makes money. He will destroy everything you remember of football from before. This has been our reality under Kroenke for years, only with conscious neglect. Beware him."
StLouisRams,36fwnn,SoulardSTL,-2,Wed May 20 18:55:03 2015 UTC,"The Rams have already rejected the CVCs offer to renovate the dome and demanded a far more expensive $700,000,000+ renovation to be paid for by the taxpayers with no lease extension.

StLouisRams,36i91e,ClitorisNigga,18,Tue May 19 16:13:48 2015 UTC,It all depends on whether Bradford gets hurt or not.  He gets hurt a lot.
StLouisRams,36i91e,ROotT,-2,Tue May 19 16:19:42 2015 UTC,http://www.rotoworld.com/articles/nfl/41237/71/draft-analysis
StLouisRams,36i91e,Bskrilla,5,Tue May 19 16:32:01 2015 UTC,I don't think Bradford is injury prone in general because I don't really think that's a thing. I was worried about coming back from back to back ACLs and how that would affect him physically and mentally.
StLouisRams,36i91e,Bskrilla,4,Tue May 19 17:10:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he hasn't been injured a lot.  I just don't think there's such a thing as an overall ""injury prone"" person.    He's had a shoulder, an ankle, and 2 ACL's.  Those are all completely different injuries other than the ACL's.   I think it's possible that a player can be prone to a certain type of injury (ACL, shoulder, etc.) especially after the first one, but there's no evidence that the sort of general term ""injury prone"" is anything other than coincidence and bad-luck, and it's definitely not a predictor of future injuries as the article above stated.    I mean Matt Stafford was the definition of ""injury prone"" for his first 2 years missing 18 of 32 starts. Then he went on to start every game for 4 straight seasons."
StLouisRams,36i91e,axle69,10,Tue May 19 18:30:34 2015 UTC,I think the Rams got the overall greater benefit unless Bradford turns into a top 10 QB. On a trade basis nobody knows how either player will play but what we do know is that both have 1 year on their contract left and have the ability to leave after its up. Bradfords comes with a $14 mil cap hit though ($16 mil for us had we kept him) whereas Foles is pennies on the dollar in comparison. You'll have to at least match his old contract if he plays well and we'll be in a situation with a guy getting his first contract. That and us getting the greater worth of picks is huge 2nd and 4th if Bradford plays most of the year and you received our 5th this year.
StLouisRams,36i91e,SoulardSTL,8,Tue May 19 18:54:20 2015 UTC,"This. It was a salary cap play. If Bradford was willing to negotiate his pay down, I bet he'd still be the Rams QB today. But, he wouldn't budge, and he was traded. In return, the Rams obtained a quality QB whose contract isn't huge, and they have $14MM to spend on the rest of the team. As we're transitioning into a more run-centric offense, having capital for a revamped O-Line while maintaining our Defense is more in line with the Rams' interests than Bradford and his $16MM/year contract."
StLouisRams,36i91e,ramSACKcity,6,Tue May 19 16:47:45 2015 UTC,"Both need to be re-signed next year.  Given that, I'm happy to have gained a lot of salary cap.  It seems that change of scenery was advantageous to Bradford and Rams, so happy about that.  Replacement starting caliber QB, happy about that.  Last but not least, better overall picks is just icing on the cake.   I might be biased but I think we won the trade.  The best either team could hope from Bradford is a healthy great season, which would then lead to a ridiculous contract but doesn't guarantee he wouldn't get hurt after next year.  So, I think we won it initially but Bradfords career can change that.  As someone said below, Bradfords career/health has a huge impact on determining the answer to this question."
StLouisRams,36i91e,Thonked,4,Tue May 19 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"The clarify, the pick you gave up in 2016 is not conditional, it's a second-rounder, period. We will send you a conditional pick if Sam gets hurt or plays fewer than 50% of your snaps."
StLouisRams,36i91e,charliedarwinsfather,1 point,Tue May 19 16:57:19 2015 UTC,"You're totally right - we get a third/fourth back if he doesn't play/out for 50% of the snaps, respectively"
StLouisRams,36i91e,axle69,3,Tue May 19 22:17:04 2015 UTC,"Less statistical analysis:  The Eagles seemed to be moving on from Foles anyway so I'm not sure they lost anything that wasn't going to be replaced regardless. For the Rams, as a fan, it feels great to move on from Bradford. For such a long time I've only seen him on the bench wasting all of our money. The fact that we have relieved cap pressure is nice, don't get me wrong, but I was just over him and wanted something new.  Not only is Foles new to the Rams, but he is relatively new in that we don't know what he is capable of yet. It's going to be an exciting mystery. At worst we have another bad QB, but for less money. At best we get a winner QB, franchise him, and he carries us to the next dynasty with the rest of our young talent."
StLouisRams,36i91e,Samu-ELBradford,1 point,Wed May 20 00:25:19 2015 UTC,"I think he has a higher ceiling than most- somewhere just above flacco most likely, but I've fallen for Big Dick Nick right from the get go some maybe I'm not the most objective commentator.  Even when he struggled he showed a lot of promise. People forget that sometimes it can take a QB a few years to develop. He's played about 2 full seasons worth of games. I think he deserved at least one more in philly, but since that obviously isn't happening, I hope he gets a full year with you guys."
StLouisRams,36i91e,axle69,3,Tue May 19 17:00:42 2015 UTC,Also while Flacco didn't carry them to the playoffs he's for damn sure the reason why they got too and won the super bowl. Dude played like a man possessed.

People like kurt warner, and many other nfl analysts continued to pick apart nick foles and saying that hes overachieving.    I wouldn't discount foles outplaying the rest of the qbs in your division though, which means the rams could be very good"

We had to move on because we have an offense based scheme and Foles probably is never going to be able to lead a offense based team to the SB."
StLouisRams,36i91e,adv0589,1 point,Wed May 20 02:56:51 2015 UTC,"I'd still rather have Dalton than either Hill, Davis, or Clemens. You are 100% right we don't need an elite QB with our team is built but that isn't/wasn't the point I was making. We've had either journeyman or back up at best QBs starting for us in what seems like forever.  Foles, at least on paper, give us a competent player that can not lose the game. If we post a 9-7 or 10-6 record then we have hope, which is terrible to root just for a winning season but I for one am tired of fielding a losing team."
StLouisRams,36i91e,adv0589,1 point,Wed May 20 17:24:16 2015 UTC,The only really misleading stat from that from that season was the absrud TD:INT ratio which could have very easily been more in the 27:12 range (still very solid).   Foles took command in a lot of games. Even last year (before injury) he stepped in big moments and led some impressive drives.
StLouisRams,36i91e,porkfish66,1 point,Wed May 20 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yes he did, but there is also something to be said about him at times putting the team in the position to need that drive.   For example he cut AZ apart down the stretch and probably should have won. But that game is over if he didn't throw 2 extremely costly interceptions."
StLouisRams,36i91e,charliedarwinsfather,1 point,Wed May 20 14:55:14 2015 UTC,It really really isn't.  I was his biggest supporter as he struggled last year but you put Flacco in that 2013 offense and he would have had just as good of numbers with similar luck.
StLouisRams,36i91e,Joeymousepad,2,Wed May 20 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it works out well for both our teams. You're spot on about Bradford's NFL career to date, IMO he never got a fair shake on the Rams. If he can stay healthy and you can resign/extend him, you'll have at least a top 10 QB. Possibly better.   If Foles can be Flacco, we're very happy with that. A game manager type QB is fine with our D, as long as our running game works out as projected. Fingers crossed on Foles, Gurley, and all our new OL."
StLouisRams,36i91e,evil_disco_man,1 point,Wed May 20 17:22:23 2015 UTC,Foles does best when the run game is doing best. Drafting Gurley shows that your coaching staff/GM have a solid understanding of the type of QB that Foles is and what they need to put around him to ensure his success.
StLouisRams,36i91e,librarianC,2,Tue May 19 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"My honest answer is I think Chip Kelly is the winner. I think Bradford is solid, but injury prone and Foles is a question mark. Chip Kelly is the winner because he keeps cementing the ""Chip Kelly's wild ride"""
StLouisRams,36i91e,superspamtastic,2,Wed May 20 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"Injuries aside, my biggest complaint about Bradford is that he's a classic ""Checkdown Charlie"" QB.  Whether that was Schottenheimer's influence or Bradford's mentality has yet to be seen.  He has obscene talent, though.  I have no idea what to think of Foles, other than ""please be above average.""  This is a wait-and-see case."
StLouisRams,36i91e,Samu-ELBradford,1 point,Fri May 22 01:24:40 2015 UTC,"Well one coup of the Rams in this is that it created more cap room.  I would have liked to see them use that cap room to get Barksdale, but it was used to get some other important pieces.  So the Rams benefited in that fashion.  That the Eagles have that much cap space to be able to pay a QB top dollar - well good for them!"
StLouisRams,368s9n,I_Only_Play_Urgot,23,Sun May 17 07:22:24 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you order from, don't overlook retired players. Warner (#13), Faulk (#28), Bruce (#80), or Holt (#81) would all be incredibly safe choices for any Rams fan."
StLouisRams,368s9n,tylerseher,3,Sun May 17 11:40:11 2015 UTC,"This is the best advice. I have a blue warner, holt, and Jackson jersey; gold Faulk jersey, and white Bruce jersey(my fav)."
StLouisRams,368s9n,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,14,Tue May 19 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"Quinn and Donald are the long term guys. Quinn might be the best bet since he's proven one.

StLouisRams,368s9n,chemicalpoisons,7,Sun May 17 21:37:46 2015 UTC,"Holt. And if you can make it a 1999 jersey, your buddy would be amazed. Not that your gesture is already awesome as hell he'll be a happy Rams fan anyway!"
StLouisRams,368s9n,diesel321,2,Mon May 18 06:37:13 2015 UTC,Quinn and Donald are probably the 2 biggest impact players right now and with the longest future with the team. Anybody else has longevity questions or really hasn't had a stellar season. Take that back the other big impact guy would be Hekker! Anybody else would be a throwback jersey like has been suggested by /u/GoldenGoat adding in Dickerson or Youngblood or Jones or a few others depending on how long he's been a fan.
StLouisRams,368s9n,letram13,2,Sun May 17 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with the comments below, do not forsake jerseys of past players. I have a Marshall Faulk elite jersey, and I wouldn't change it for any player right now (unless Foles proves to be our saviour)."
StLouisRams,368s9n,diesel321,2,Sun May 17 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"Absolute safest - Warner, Faulk, Holt   Very safe - Quinn  Pretty safe - Donald, Hekker  I wouldn't buy a jersey of anybody else given your circumstances. Retired players are kind of boring choices but can't go wrong at all, especially depending how old he is (i.e. if >30 probably). Quinn will finish his career with the Rams I imagine and is elite. I'd go with him if you want an active player. Donald is still young, although I imagine he will be great. Hekker is a punter which is a high turnover position but he is very good and pretty funny and likeable so a lot of people want his jersey despite being a punter.  tldr Quinn"

StLouisRams,3687qf,bretris,16,Sun May 17 02:54:04 2015 UTC,"You know, he's being downvoted pretty heavily right now, but /u/theduke13 does have a point... This is repeated news, and we're mostly guessing probabilities here. Personally, all I've heard of are rumors and innuendos, some with good substance, but nothing that can be relied upon with certainty.  I do think Peacock was aware enough of his surroundings to know he was speaking at an event sponsored by a business newspaper and knew that what he said before that audience would be reported on, and he's smart enough to know not to talk out his ass. Seriously, he was CEO of AB and oversaw its acquisition, this isn't his first M&A rodeo. Meanwhile, I'm just curious what we'll hear next."
StLouisRams,3687qf,SoulardSTL,2,Sun May 17 05:07:23 2015 UTC,My initial thought when it was leaked that Kroenke wanted to move the team to LA was that he would do it and build a big beautiful stadium. Then within a couple years of said stadium being built he would sell the team to somebody in the LA area for a metric shit ton of money. After he does that he will buy the Bronco's who could be sold soon. Pat Bowlen is battling ALS and there is discussion that he's brother sister and kids aren't interested in the ownership and it's responsibilities. Just more speculation but that was my initial though and it's all the more interesting because all of Stans other pro teams in the US are in Denver.
StLouisRams,3687qf,bozo7337,2,Sun May 17 13:03:18 2015 UTC,"We have the exact same understanding. I truly believe Kroenke has eyes on the LA market just to move a team in there, jack up the private equity value, then sell it all off to a local contingent of investors for the increased valuation, and make the play for the Broncos.   I've heard that Kroenke's already pressuring the Bowlen family for the team. When Pat Bowlen passes on, the team will apparently pass into an estate, with his heirs as trustees. The trustees will then have a certain amount of time to figure out what to do with the team before they're swamped with estate taxes. Even if they want to keep the team within the family, the taxes that’ll be due apparently would wipe them out. Hence, Kroenke's opportunistic interests, as well as Kroenke Sports Enterprises’ continued empire in Denver.   Kroenke doesn't care for LA, or the Rams. He just wants to make a real estate play, with an NFL franchise as the lure. My fellow Rams fans in LA, I tell you in sincerity that his conscious neglect of the fan base in STL is very apparent, almost to the point where you start to wonder how many times he's seen Major League. Whether in STL or LA, out of love for our team, I sincerely hope for the rapid end of Kroenke’s ownership, because he is destroying our fan base."
StLouisRams,3687qf,SoulardSTL,6,Sun May 17 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"I really doubt Stan Kroenke is building a 1.86 billion dollar stadium and buying into HPLC, a 2 billion dollar investment in the surrounding development, in order to sell the team in a few years.    The HPLC is SK's bread and butter-more a land development deal than a team deal. He's going to want to be involved for a long team, team and stadium included.    http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-stadium-economics-20150226-story.html#page=1  Is all this other team swap/buying/re-selling possible? Sure.    But I think its needlessly complicated in order to fit a narrative.   And about the Broncos, I've heard nothing from Denver reporters about Stan being interested in buying the broncos, or the family being willing to sell to Stan.  By this account, it seems pretty clear John Elway is going to get first crack at the team if it doesnt stay in the Bowlen family.    http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_26575449/wholl-be-given-reins-broncos-ownership"
StLouisRams,3687qf,revolver066,1 point,Sun May 17 22:39:56 2015 UTC,If Steve Balmer paid that much money for the Clippers to share a stadium with a vastly more popular team how much would he pay for a football team that has a chance to be more popular than either of the other possibilities to move to LA with them? Add in that possibly owning the stadium and having a tenant? Kroenke in this hypothetical could make around $4 Billion if the stadium sells as well.
StLouisRams,3687qf,bozo7337,0,Sun May 17 20:29:29 2015 UTC,"Does that include the price of the stadium as well? And how much would the price of the team go down if it wasn't the only team playing in the market? That's why Kroenke wants to be the only team in LA, so he can be the only game in town and get a higher premium when he sells them. Ballmer in a consortium of Magic Johnson and others wanting a piece of the pie; maybe even an entity like Disney or Paramount, full brand continuations, who really knows.   Say he sells a relocated Rams team and makes a play for the Broncos down the line... Wouldn't the NFL compel him to sell the stadium so he's not landlord of another franchise? Price only goes up from there. Very much, it'd be in the neighborhood of $4BB. How this ties into the development partnership, who knows...   And of course, what if Carson is the preferred option, or at least the Carson teams? What if the NFL prefers the Chargers and Raiders in LA? Would Kroenke sell the Rams so the Chargers and Raiders can become his tenants in Inglewood? Because if the Rams stay in STL and the Chargers and/or Raiders go after Carson, that's an incredible amount of opportunity costs he'd face. Maybe that would make it in his interests to sell the team."

Of course we've all heard Kronks wants to leave, but god damn, you're pissing more people off by making the LA Rams, and the St. Louis Raiders. The big reason why journalists are reporting it is the fact that St. Louis has made strides to keep the Rams.

The pieces are in place for a playoff run, especially with Bradford gone and Foles in his place.  But somehow it won't happen."
StLouisRams,365k3f,LLv2,0,Sat May 16 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"Other than a few of the disappointing losses against significantly weaker opponents, I would say I can't lay blame to Fish alone. QB is the difference. My source: Captain Obvious.  You go 8 wins on defense and SPT alone. You have a good run game and are reloaded at Oline.  If you just had a QB that didn't turn it over, you could beat a lot of teams. Depending on which Foles you get (Super Rookie Foles, or Sophomore average Foles). Being in the toughest division in football doesn't help either. I think Fisher is a pretty good coach. At least against Seattle he always has a great game plan. Maybe he's not a world-beater with innovative strategy, but he's in the top 10-12 of active coaches in a lot of circles."

He manages to beat the Seahawks 1/year and lose to three teams he should have beaten easily, every year.

StLouisRams,360mhd,frankoftank,2,Fri May 15 03:56:54 2015 UTC,"He would be a great mentor for our young RBs, but he's too expensive to just let him ride the bench."
StLouisRams,360mhd,axle69,7,Fri May 15 07:12:11 2015 UTC,He'll retire a ram either way it'll just be on a 1 day contract instead of on the roster. Hate to say it but the Cardinals would be a good spot for him to land.
StLouisRams,360mhd,The49ersBlow,7,Fri May 15 07:47:36 2015 UTC,I hope he finds a job. He gave his career to some really horrid Rams teams. And he's a real classy guy.
StLouisRams,360mhd,Cj1596357,4,Fri May 15 11:05:08 2015 UTC,Indy or Dallas seem like a perfect fit.

StLouisRams,35vj7g,bleedblue89,17,Wed May 13 21:30:34 2015 UTC,I hope this happens regardless of the nfl staying. I think this market would support a team.
StLouisRams,35vj7g,crackalac,7,Thu May 14 01:24:05 2015 UTC,Truth. St. Louis is a huge soccer town. It's criminal they haven't been able to land a team yet.
StLouisRams,35vj7g,alderaan_never4get,18,Thu May 14 05:12:54 2015 UTC,"MLS only shows interest to this degree if a facility is available. They've wanted to be in STL for years, but it was always that there wasn't a site in STL that could accommodate professional soccer up to MLS standards (open air, in urban core, designed with soccer in mind). If their commissioner's coming here to see what Peacock & Co. have to show, which they never publicly did in previous local negotiations, then these efforts must be further along than generally realized, noting that above-all the North Riverfront Stadium is being built to retain the Rams."
StLouisRams,35vj7g,SoulardSTL,4,Wed May 13 22:44:55 2015 UTC,"Unless they build a soccer specific stadium, I think they are out of luck.    Here is a quote from the MLS commish:  “we believe our league is going to be built, and ultimately be more successful, if we can play in stadiums that are our own.”   http://www.fieldofschemes.com/category/mls/minneapolis-mls-team/  I mean, in Minny they picked an UNFUNDED stadium IDEA that was soccer specific over a brand new state of the art football stadium/soccer specific combo.  That should tell you something.  And there are plenty of other cities besides STL clamoring for a team too.  And before you go saying ""but in Atlanta and Seattle they have dual stadiums!""  Yes but thats because the owner of the NFL team owns the MLS team.  Unless you get a miracle sale, ain't gonna happen with Stan .  Honestly, I think the clearest path for the MLS in STL is having the Rams leave and using a fraction of that public $ towards a soccer specific stadium.  We'll see what Garber says in his visit though."
StLouisRams,35vj7g,revolver066,4,Thu May 14 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"Never say never, I'm in Vancouver.  The Whitecaps play in a stadium built for Expo 86 which was then used for Canadian football, then renovated for the Olympics.  Now they're hosting the Women's World Cup there.  I'm sure the ideal situation would be soccer primary, but if they have interest in the market, they will do what they can to get in there.  Edit: forgot to mention the Canadian football team still shares the stadium, and there is way more overlap with CFL and MLS than the NFL would have."
StLouisRams,35vj7g,VladimirPoontang,0,Thu May 14 17:37:04 2015 UTC,"hey, nothing wrong with keeping the faith if you're STL.    I just wouldn't bet on it."

StLouisRams,35vj7g,VladimirPoontang,0,Thu May 14 22:38:01 2015 UTC,yeah its tough. Some one is going to get hurt.    Id probably have more sympathy for STL if they didnt take the team from LA to begin with.    Of course they went after a team only because the Cards left and the NFL passed on STL for Jax for expansion.   Shitty situation all around.
StLouisRams,35vj7g,revolver066,3,Thu May 14 22:49:00 2015 UTC,"Id probably have more sympathy for STL if they didnt take the team from LA to begin with.   Not trying to start anything here, but St. Louis took what was given to them. The Rams came here on their own free will. LA choose not to build them a stadium.  That isn't our fault."
StLouisRams,35vj7g,D9-EM,2,Thu May 14 23:49:38 2015 UTC,Oh for sure. Thats how these things work at the core-its a business and all that jazz.  STL built a free stadium and gave the Rams an insanely good deal with a crazy top tier clause. Now that top tier clause is being exploited and may lead to the team's exit.   And LA's refusal to subsidize an NFL stadium led to a 20 year (and possibly more) NFL drought.   What you reap is what you sow for both cities. And the NFL owners will chase the money..from LA to STL to wherever.

Then on top of that the Rams announced a charity event in the area with the Magic House. Somehow we went from no participation in the area to being very active in the STL area. It might not mean anything, but I'm glad to see them get active again in the area."

StLouisRams,35up0a,SoulardSTL,12,Wed May 13 17:43:29 2015 UTC,Every article I read makes me hate Stan Kroenke more and more. What a piece of shit.
StLouisRams,35up0a,golong92,21,Wed May 13 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"Friend of mine is a relation to Stan Kroenke by marriage. I asked him about Kroenke a couple months ago...   Q: ""What're the chances he tries to relocate the team?"" A: ""Maybe 50/50."" (asked in January, after Inglewood announcement and before news of the North Riverfront Stadium went public)   Q: ""What's he like?"" A: ""The only person I've ever met more awful than Stan Kroenke is his wife.... They're human garbage."""
StLouisRams,35up0a,Seductive_Santa,6,Wed May 13 18:29:38 2015 UTC,"Highly recommend Vincent Bonsignore's The NFL in L.A. blog. Some of the best, most consistent writing on all things ""Los Angeles relocation"", with no bias towards the Rams, Chargers, or Raiders.   There was one thing I've heard for some time that was left out of his story... From the arbitration hearings, I remember reading that the $700MM redevelopment proposal for the EJD submitted by Kroenke did not include any lease renewal contingent to the upgrades. Not in the development proposal, which was the purview of the arbitrators' ruling, but when discussions were made between Kroenke and the CVC/RSA, STL, and MO on whether or not the development would actually take place. Or: Without that lease commitment, Kroenke would've been able to relocate from STL for LA anyways. Legally speaking, we'd be in position for the same argument we have now in nine years, and with STL/MO $700MM+ in the hole.   I would think this context changes the entire dynamic of the ""free agent"" argument."
StLouisRams,35up0a,Seductive_Santa,4,Wed May 13 17:55:56 2015 UTC,"Bonsignore writes for the South Bay's Daily Breeze, which serves the city of Carson. He has a vested interest to bring a football team to his neighborhood. He's been called out on local radio and by politicians since his writing involves a lot of guesswork. There's a couple journalists in LA doing real digging on the stadium sites and going beyond what you might read on national news. From following this since last January (I want a team back here, even if it's not the Rams) this isn't the guy to follow."
StLouisRams,35up0a,agentfox,3,Wed May 13 20:47:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's not the only LA writer I read these days, mostly Sam Farmer but also Tim Logan for the economic development work (knew him when he wrote in STL). Vinny's said a few times (interviews, tweets) that he's keeping himself agnostic to individual teams and efforts, and I haven't noticed a Carson bias, if nothing else I hear him hyping Inglewood. Still, appreciate the heads-up. I do like the blog he's set up, but if you have other writers to follow on the subject, I'm all ears."
StLouisRams,35vjng,One_Half_Hamster,2,Wed May 13 21:33:52 2015 UTC,"So, I'm not an X's and O's guy, I'm hoping someone can clarify for me. He's an elite zone blocker but not a very good power blocker. Does anyone know what type of run blocking the Rams do?"
StLouisRams,35vjng,Sinisterminister77,3,Wed May 13 22:15:09 2015 UTC,"Basically he is going to be better at pass protection than run blocking, but at the same time his run blocking is more proven than any other Centers we have on our roster.  Edit: Misunderstood question, answered the question in my next comment."
StLouisRams,35vjng,Sinisterminister77,4,Wed May 13 22:24:39 2015 UTC,"No, there's different running schemes. He's an elite run blocker, but only in zone schemes."
StLouisRams,35vjng,TheSmart1,3,Wed May 13 22:27:45 2015 UTC,Sorry I misunderstood what you were asking.  The answer is nobody knows yet.  Schottenheimer was Man/Power but we don't know what Cignetti will do.
StLouisRams,35vjng,sjphilsphan,7,Wed May 13 22:30:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's any stretch to assume we'll still be using a man/power scheme.

This is why we’re spending most of our time with the league — we think this is an NFL issue.”"

If given the choice, would Kroenke rather own the Rams in STL and not be involved in LA? Or, would he prefer to house those teams in his development in Inglewood, at the cost of no longer owning the Rams?   Personally, I think he wants to profit off of the LA real estate market more than he wants to own a team. In the end, I think he wants most of all to eventually own the Denver Broncos, whose current ownership he’s been pressuring to sell to him for some time."

StLouisRams,35qwyq,KingRoyMustang,4,Tue May 12 19:46:29 2015 UTC,"For me the article is totally blanked out, can you TL:DR?"
StLouisRams,35qwyq,lojafr,9,Tue May 12 21:16:58 2015 UTC,"In one fat paragraph, Rams chief operating officer Kevin Demoff must have used the word “buzz” a dozen times if he used it once. Rather than use the term as some fast-talking marketeer, Demoff waved the term as a concession to reality. “We continue to evaluate every year how you better generate buzz. But in the world of social media, marketing and authenticity, you can’t force buzz. Buzz is earned,” Demoff acknowledged Friday as the Rams prepared to begin a two-day rookie orientation for 26 players in Earth City. “It’s hard to generate buzz when there’s a lot of noise going on that has nothing to do with football.”  Welcome to the summer of buzz kill, when a potential lame-duck NFL franchise realizes many will judge every business or on-field move against a backdrop of ingrained disgust.  Did the Rams spend the draft’s No. 10 pick on Georgia running back Todd Gurley because they think he is a transcendent ballcarrier?  Or was it part of some elaborate scheme by Mayflower’s Team to add glitz before it trucks off to Los Angeles?  C’mon.  Everyone knows taking an offensive lineman first would have excited the Rams’ prospective market as much as receiving a six-pack of socks for Christmas.  If the Rams surge this season, the narrative will be the franchise finally got serious in order to impress a new, more cosmopolitan, wealthier audience.  If the Rams tank, it’s part of a sinister plot hatched on some grassy knoll to make the Edward Jones Dome resemble an empty airplane hanger for NFL big wigs and a national television audience.  Oh, yes, the Rams project to have more room below the salary cap than at least 25 rivals following next season. Perfect.  Los Angeles gets the flowers. St. Louis once more gets the fertilizer.  “I think as an organization you understand the unique challenges this season has brought, both to the organization and to the fan base,” Demoff said. “The best solution as we go through the process on a daily basis has been to get to the core of what the organization should always be about — building a better football team and providing the resources to go compete in the NFC West, win the division and get to the playoffs. That’s our focus right now on the football field.  “Hopefully, over the long term, that’s what gets folks excited about coming to the Edward Jones Dome this fall. Winning offseason accolades or the best grades in the draft isn’t going to be what changes opinions this year. It’s going to be winning games on the field. We get that.”  If coach Jeff Fisher trims his mustache it’s judged within the context of possible relocation.  A summer scrimmage in Oxnard, Calif., against the Dallas Cowboys has no tangible meaning. But its symbolism incites far more than the 300 fans who would have attended camp that day.  The Rams have done much to reshape a bland offense — new offensive coordinator, a fresh quarterback, the new feature back, a renovated offensive line — but uncertainty over where the Rams will play in 2016 is a black hole from which no light can escape.  “I think this team will generate buzz in August, September and October. That’s the meaningful buzz we need,” said Demoff, returning to the fashionable B-word. “We’ve had plenty of buzz in the offseason before. It doesn’t always translate to buzz in season. I’d rather get the buzz in season and work it backwards.”  Fisher sets fans’ hair ablaze when he speaks matter-of-factly on draft day of patience and long-term thinking. Demoff underscores the franchise is committed to building extended success rather than winning the preseason by (again) overpaying for declining or brittle free agents.  Yet if the Rams were committed to sameness, why trade Sam Bradford for Nick Foles?  Meanwhile, the time for checking on West Coast rents approaches.  A significant number of Rams employees received an update last week. Reality is that many on the business side would not be asked to accompany the team west; marketing and sales positions would go to those more familiar with the new territory. Some of those offered the opportunity probably would decline to sever deep St. Louis roots.  Two prominent sales and marketing execs have accepted jobs with Green Bay and Tampa Bay since last season, moves Demoff explains as a promotion and a return to a familiar clime. But let’s be real here — selling the Rams to a cynical market is as easy as selling lighter fluid in Hades.  The Rams anticipate a season-ticket base of about 40,000 to erode by more than 10 percent. And that estimate might prove to be conservative. You want evidence of the poor renewal rate? The club put single-game tickets on sale this month rather than its traditional August date after the deadline for season-ticket renewals has passed.  It’s possible, perhaps probable, the Rams will struggle to draw 40,000 to the Sept. 13 season-opener — against the defending NFC champion Seattle Seahawks. They continue to advertise but might be better served marketing to Pittsburgh and Chicago, places that could travel better than Fenton and either O’Fallon in the area.  It no longer matters if Kroenke planned this relocation gambit long before he exercised his option to purchase the Rams, or whether he merely is acting in response to tone-deaf civic leadership that ran a failed bluff regarding much-needed updates to the Dome.  When Demoff uses the term “unique” to describe the situation, he’s only partly correct. It may well be for those working under the same roof. For those with memories of 1987-88 and the romanticized Gridbirds, it’s another buzz kill.  The narrative is set in cement. Critical mass on a possible move is about five months away. We’re to believe St. Louis has again been jilted, allegedly through no fault of its own. Now if politicians can only find a way to avoid a referendum on public financing.  And that’s your market, at least for one more season. There are no minds left to change."

StLouisRams,35oor9,thisbeareatsbacon,1 point,Tue May 12 17:41:46 2015 UTC,Probably my favorite pick 6. Maybe because i was at that game and was on that side of the endzone where it happened.
StLouisRams,35oor9,bleedblue89,11,Tue May 12 21:25:48 2015 UTC,RIP Sanders
StLouisRams,35oor9,Bobwehadababyitsagir,5,Tue May 12 12:14:29 2015 UTC,that dallas lead :( still cant get over that
StLouisRams,35oor9,Myndspyke,3,Tue May 12 20:00:41 2015 UTC,I was thinking the same thing.
StLouisRams,35oor9,sweeps28,2,Wed May 13 00:22:39 2015 UTC,"I was there for that game, I was so pumped that we were stomping the cowboys the first half. Then it all just went to shit. I'm still salty towards Jenkins a little for him getting burnt for a touchdown with like 20 seconds left"
StLouisRams,35oor9,AJM5K6,5,Wed May 13 04:39:12 2015 UTC,A lot of NFL fans from around the league forget that our defense was this good. We lost a lot of games because out offense was anemic and couldn't consistently put up points. We have a playoff caliber defense and we can compete in the NFC West. I am hoping that the offensive linemen we drafted pan out and we can get some production out of the talent we have at running back.  But make no mistake our defense is something to be feared.   And I have nothing personal against Sanders but I laughed my ass off when they changed his wikipedia article to add place of death St. Louis.
StLouisRams,35oor9,TheDuke13,3,Tue May 12 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"Is it me or did that hit on Sanders look clean. Shoulder to shoulder. Did they call it because he was a ""defenseless receiver""?"
StLouisRams,35oor9,CallOnTyrone,16,Tue May 12 12:35:54 2015 UTC,"They called it because it ""looked bad"" but it was a completely legal hit."
StLouisRams,35oor9,CallOnTyrone,12,Tue May 12 13:02:33 2015 UTC,Yep. It just happened so fast the ref assumed it wasn't clean.
StLouisRams,35oor9,edubs_stl,9,Tue May 12 13:12:11 2015 UTC,"Which you can't really blame the ref for, at full speed it looked hella nasty."
StLouisRams,35oor9,DefenderCone97,13,Tue May 12 13:17:13 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, in all fairness the ref probably made the safe call.  The most impressive thing about the hit in general is that he was able to do it cleanly."
StLouisRams,35oor9,Vanscoten,5,Tue May 12 13:43:13 2015 UTC,"It was clean, it just looked vicious and the ref assumed that it was an illegal hit."
StLouisRams,35oor9,lakerfan91,3,Tue May 12 14:25:41 2015 UTC,God that Sanders hit was fucking brutal
StLouisRams,35oor9,PeterVanNostrand,6,Wed May 13 06:10:12 2015 UTC,"That track was fire though, just like our defense."
StLouisRams,35oor9,AngerManagement258,2,Tue May 12 14:45:36 2015 UTC,That was really well made.
StLouisRams,35oor9,Detroitlover88,2,Tue May 12 08:34:34 2015 UTC,"As a longtime fan, it's funny how you go from feeling pride about the offense to feeling pride about the defense over many years. I can't wait for the season to start."

StLouisRams,35my4h,Thonked,19,Mon May 11 20:45:19 2015 UTC,Foles has to prove his monster year wasn't a product of Chip Kelly. If we have average to good QB play then we are a playoff team.
StLouisRams,35my4h,Seductive_Santa,17,Mon May 11 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"Who do you think has the most weight on their shoulders?   Dline since they are considered one of the best in the NFL and heart of this team.  If we have yet another losing season who will get most of the blame?  Jeff Fisher and the coaching Staff  If we have a winning season/playoffs/Super Bowl Championship, who will receive the praise for stepping up and performing?  Nick Foles because the media will love the comeback QB storyline"
StLouisRams,35my4h,genericpoop,1 point,Mon May 11 21:24:19 2015 UTC,"Especially agree on the third one. All we need is decent QB play and we'll be pushing for playoffs, so if foles plays completely average the media is going to eat it up and talk about comeback player of the year, franchise QB, blah blah blah."
StLouisRams,35my4h,frankoftank,4,Tue May 12 05:45:02 2015 UTC,"I think if we have another losing season without key injuries then the blame has to go to the coaches. We have enough young talent where we are set up to win with an amazing top 10 defense and a run game that will wear teams out.   If we have a good year and see playoffs then I think it's because of Foles. If everyone else performs at the level they are expected to he will be the biggest game changer since we haven't had a real starting quarterback in two years. We just need someone that doesn't turn the ball over much, don't get hurt and run a good play action with our two headed beasts in the back field."
StLouisRams,35my4h,AGGRESSIVE_BUTTHOLE,2,Mon May 11 20:53:29 2015 UTC,"I think if we have no injuries and we have bad season that the blame could fall to either the coaching staff or the OLine if it under performs. Yeah we have young talent but without a foundation it can be hard to produce. I could see at the end of the season people looking back and saying, ""The Rams had all of the pieces except an experienced and consistent OLine.""   And I agree, if we do well enough to get into the playoffs it's because of Foles having a breakout year."
StLouisRams,35my4h,One_Half_Hamster,4,Mon May 11 22:03:48 2015 UTC,I would go on to add a dual threat of Mason/Gurley having breakout years as well.  If we have the ability to ground and pound consistently this year our offensive production and consistency will reap the benefits.  Can you imagine not having a 3rd quarter drought in 85% of our games?  Glorious.
StLouisRams,35my4h,SoulardSTL,3,Mon May 11 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"Different types of pressure. The O-Line as a whole has been our weakest link, and after the investments placed into talent, it must improve. Hands down, their improvement is the most necessary and most expected. Should our O-Line improve, we will see more opportunities for breakout performance by Foles (who has a 1 year contract and a rookie in the wings) and Gurley (with pressure to deliver top-pick expectations in platoon with Tre Mason). But, this offense only can come into being if the O-Line is sound. Meanwhile, the D must stay the D they were last year; they do that, and they'll be awesome.   Assuming no calamities like Bradford's other ACL last year (knock wood)... If the team is again under the .500 line, I expect the coaching staff will be under immense pressure of immediate dismissal. If we make the playoffs, they could be deified, and the Fisher mustache could re-enter popular fashions.   Who's under the most pressure? David Peacock and Bob Blitz to secure a new home... and by proxy Kevin Demoff, who has to sell tickets to a concerned fan base, as well as making sure his boss isn't murdered by those same fans."
StLouisRams,35my4h,BrawndoTTM,4,Mon May 11 21:54:39 2015 UTC,"Nick Foles has by far the most to gain and also the most to lose. This is a contract year and his performance this season is going to ultimately make or break tens of millions of dollars for him. If we make the playoffs, or even have a winning season, he's going to make franchise QB money on an extension. If we go 7-9 again or worse (and he stays healthy all season) he's basically doomed to being a journeyman backup for the rest of his career."
StLouisRams,35my4h,zaviex,1 point,Mon May 11 22:42:05 2015 UTC,he'd worst case get a camp chance to win a job.
StLouisRams,35my4h,PRE_-CISION-_,1 point,Thu May 14 14:14:43 2015 UTC,I really don't feel worried at all like I did with Bradford. Something about Foles just makes me feel like he's the real deal. I have had the misfortune of watching nearly every Eagles game and the dude is simply a baller.
StLouisRams,35my4h,genericman12,2,Wed May 13 04:22:53 2015 UTC,"I think the most pressure is on the OL and the coaching staff. The OL has to perform since we invested pretty heavily in them the past two years. The coaching staff has produce the results that they have been promising for a while. Last year was supposed to be the year we break out but injuries got in the way. So if we don't have a winning season this year, it may be time to for some new coaches."
StLouisRams,35my4h,TonsofKeas,2,Mon May 11 21:55:27 2015 UTC,There might be a lot of pressure on Foles because of the O-Line....
StLouisRams,35o5tx,BrawndoTTM,10,Tue May 12 02:33:44 2015 UTC,He's a strong safety. We have TJ McDonald and Marc Barron. We don't need him. There is obviously something wrong with this kid of the Texans are willing to just release a former 1st round pick.
StLouisRams,35o5tx,bozo7337,3,Tue May 12 03:58:54 2015 UTC,"*2nd round pick, 57 overall."
StLouisRams,35o5tx,EricLanigan,1 point,Tue May 12 06:52:21 2015 UTC,I stand corrected. Forgot he was one of those sure fire first round picks that every year falls because the draft pundits get it wrong.
StLouisRams,35o5tx,bozo7337,2,Tue May 12 13:36:28 2015 UTC,"Your point remains valid, though. He's a highly talented prospect with major character concerns. Someone will take a chance on him, but it's not a glaring need for us and I don't think he's worth the headache."
StLouisRams,35o5tx,alderaan_never4get,2,Tue May 12 17:40:30 2015 UTC,He wasn't a sure-fire first rounder.  Swearinger was seen as a 3rd rounder early but got hyped up to being a 2nd rounder before the end of the college football season..  Are you thinking of Matt Elam who most thought would be taken mid-first but ended up being the last pick taken on Day 1?
StLouisRams,35o5tx,MisterTuesdayNight,6,Tue May 12 20:23:14 2015 UTC,Risking having a tough time with his personality is hardly worth it when we are fairly set at Safety right now.
StLouisRams,35o5tx,One_Half_Hamster,7,Tue May 12 02:36:59 2015 UTC,And Fairley set at DT too.  I know it's not relevant to Swearinger but I couldn't pass it up.

StLouisRams,35o5tx,the_logistician,3,Tue May 12 13:27:44 2015 UTC,"Don't need him at all. I don't think he's any better than McDonald, McLeod or mark Barron."
StLouisRams,35o5tx,frankoftank,1 point,Tue May 12 05:50:50 2015 UTC,Yeah he definitely does not handle the tough personalities well at all
StLouisRams,35lmdk,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,3,Mon May 11 14:44:58 2015 UTC,"I feel like because Ifedi has proven success at a proven school like Memphis, that puts him slightly higher, but Westbrooks showed a lot of really good potential in pre-season.  Ultimately I'll go for Ifedi as he seems the more natural athlete"
StLouisRams,35lmdk,TGMurray,1 point,Mon May 11 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"Tough to say, I don't think either of them sees the field a whole lot this season. Our d-line is one of the best in the league and that's going to be tough for them to break in to."
StLouisRams,35lmdk,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Mon May 11 15:43:20 2015 UTC,"Too early to even speculate without seeing them compete in practices or preseason I think. Considering Westbrooks fell out for behavioral reasons and Ifeti fell because of injury and production, I'd bet on Westbrooks."
StLouisRams,35lmdk,Sinisterminister77,1 point,Mon May 11 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"I vote Westbrooks. He was the best DE in the league in last year's preseason according to PFF. He also did alright in the regular season, though didn't get many snaps.   Ifedi seems like a good prospect, but I'll go with the guy that already has some NFL (albeit preseason NFL) success."

StLouisRams,35j229,french_toste,15,Mon May 11 04:15:44 2015 UTC,We'd have been in the final one if we'd have just used a freaking draft pick on him aaaaaaaauuuughhhhhhhh.
StLouisRams,35j229,Thonked,1 point,Sun May 10 21:59:13 2015 UTC,I was really hoping wed pull the trigger on him in the 3rd round. He was worth it and wouldve been a game changer in our run first offense.
StLouisRams,35j229,frankoftank,5,Mon May 11 20:39:29 2015 UTC,Should have used that 2nd third rounder on him. Mannion would have been there in the 4th :(
StLouisRams,35j229,Bond_007x,11,Sun May 10 22:30:24 2015 UTC,Should have used a 7th rounder on him.
StLouisRams,35j229,fireman225s,3,Sun May 10 22:51:47 2015 UTC,Except then he just wouldn't sign and re-enter the draft next year
StLouisRams,35j229,LLv2,2,Sun May 10 23:33:01 2015 UTC,Do you get to re-enter the draft if you get drafted and refuse to sign?
StLouisRams,35j229,vrock627,3,Mon May 11 00:47:03 2015 UTC,yep
StLouisRams,35j229,frankoftank,9,Mon May 11 01:26:59 2015 UTC,He straight up said he wouldn't sign if he was taken on the third day of the draft. So taking him with our last pick on day two would have been the latest we could have conceivably taken him.
StLouisRams,35j229,m_fromm,9,Sun May 10 23:32:51 2015 UTC,It's a 7th round pick who really cares if he doesn't sign. You see if he actually sticks to that since he would not have been allowed in the supplemental draft or the draft next year and he'd just have been in the same position he is now but with a year lost.
StLouisRams,35j229,Ihateunerds,3,Mon May 11 00:10:40 2015 UTC,You're allowed to enter the draft next year if you're drafted and don't sign. You're not allowed to re-enter the draft if you're not selected.
StLouisRams,35j229,m_fromm,0,Mon May 11 00:37:19 2015 UTC,"Still, I don't really see that not being worth a 7th round pick. 7th rounders are already in large part just teams picking up priority free agents. It isn't Elway refusing to play for the Colts as the first overall pick. And he wound up pretty much getting the same amount of money as a 7th round pick gets anyways, just the Cowboy's don't exactly limit themselves to a more standard contract (fully guaranteed with re-negotiation rights after 2 years is pretty unheard of in the NFL)."
StLouisRams,35j229,Ihateunerds,3,Mon May 11 00:57:51 2015 UTC,He said he wouldn't sign. That's why all 32 teams passed on him.  I don't know why this is so hard for many of you to understand.
StLouisRams,35j229,vrock627,3,Mon May 11 01:33:49 2015 UTC,why waste a 7th rounder to piss of a guy who doesnt want to be drafted. we would look like assholes and wouldnt be able to draft him in next years draft due to bad blood. atleast this way we had a shot at grabbing him as a UDFA.
StLouisRams,35j229,Ihateunerds,0,Mon May 11 01:29:10 2015 UTC,It actually wouldn't have pissed him off. He wanted a team to draft him late and give him the chance to take a year off and clear his name (assuming he is innocent) and get picked up in the first next year.
StLouisRams,35j229,vrock627,2,Mon May 11 01:37:18 2015 UTC,if he wanted a team to pick him he would not have announced he wouldnt sign.
StLouisRams,35j229,Ihateunerds,-1,Mon May 11 01:41:59 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it was a good strategy. He doesn't seem like a smart man. But he clearly wanted to be able to re-enter the draft next year and obviously that's the only way to do so. Dude also might be a murderer who never sees the field so it could all be a moot point.
StLouisRams,35j229,vrock627,3,Mon May 11 02:29:07 2015 UTC,his agent made the statement. they obviously where shooting for a UDFA spot
StLouisRams,35j229,Ihateunerds,-1,Mon May 11 02:35:07 2015 UTC,"Hmmm didn't realize that. His agent is a moron too.  UDFA is better for him than going on day 3 with the shorter rookie contract, but the best outcome for him personally would've been to sit this year out and if the murder was just a tragic coincidence he would be a first rounder next year."
StLouisRams,35j229,frankoftank,3,Mon May 11 02:43:30 2015 UTC,"If we would have drafted him in the 7th and he refused to sign then he would have been eligible for next year's draft. Of course we might have drafted him in the 3rd and he could have went back on his word and still refused to sign, which would blow, but he 100% would have refused to sign on day 3 of the draft so it's just flushing a pick down the toilet."
StLouisRams,35j229,BrawndoTTM,2,Mon May 11 03:06:44 2015 UTC,"It was stupid not to take him in the 3rd. We had an extra pick and it was worth the gamble. Unless Jamon Brown turns out good or Mannion is the QB of our future, we seriously fucked that up."
StLouisRams,35j229,LLv2,-4,Mon May 11 00:03:02 2015 UTC,It was stupid not to take him in the 7th.  We could have signed Bryce whats-his-face' son as an UDFA.
StLouisRams,35j229,vrock627,7,Mon May 11 00:41:46 2015 UTC,he wouldnt have signed
StLouisRams,35nemg,The49ersBlow,14,Mon May 11 22:50:16 2015 UTC,"I do think the punishment over deflated footballs is completely stupid. However, the Patriots are habitual line steppers. Spygate, in my mind (and of the great Marshall Faulk), cost us a super bowl. There were given a slap on the wrist as punishment. They benefited from the only actually called tuck rule call.  Tom Brady got a rule created for not hitting quarterbacks below the knee when just a year earlier Carson Palmer had the same thing happen to him, in the playoffs, with no rule changing for him.  Their fans are more entitled than Spurs fans, bitching up a storm whenever they don't get a call. Brady screams at the refs like a bitch and its chalked up to ""fiery passion"". No, dumbass. He's being a fucking baby. He isn't tough. He slid cleats up at Ed Reed, fuck him.  I realize that even in this sub it will probably be downvoted, but I think this whole stupid-ass deflategate is karma for that fucking teams history of entitlement. Fuck 'em"

It makes sense to me that the NFL would come down harder on someone cheating to get a competitive edge than someone doing something horrible that does not affect the actual play of the game.  From the leagues perspective what would be worse: a ref taking money under the table to throw a game or one of their players getting caught murdering someone?

StLouisRams,35hf90,Jewmangi,2,Sun May 10 18:14:41 2015 UTC,he is really good with the press already. sounds like he is a hard working kid with his head on straight who wants to play football.
StLouisRams,35ido0,anyhistoricalfigure,12,Sun May 10 17:52:52 2015 UTC,"Lots of potential. The problem is, there's a long way to go.  He's got the frame and the arm. Good, high release point that takes full advantage of his height. His problem, from what I've seen, comes from his footwork, which is really inconsistent, and when it's bad it's awful.  He has throws where he doesn't get the zip on the ball that he should with his arm because he doesn't step into the throw properly. He's got throws where the ball doesn't go where it's supposed to because his feet aren't right. It all starts from the ground up.  The good part is, footwork can be fixable. He seems to have more problems with mistakes because of the mechanical issues than because of a lack of system understanding or issues with field awareness, which is a positive. The biggest reason I'm not all that excited about his potential, though, is that he looks slow and leaden even on his drops, like the problems with footwork go deeper than simple bad mechanics.  My bet on him is a small chance that with time and the right coaching, he turns into a fantastic QB, and a much higher chance that he never really improves and is out of the league in a few years, with the middle ground being that he improves a bit and becomes a decent backup."
StLouisRams,35ido0,cdskip,5,Sun May 10 22:45:05 2015 UTC,I agree. The great thing about him is that his strengths tend to be less coachable assets and his weaknesses are much more coachable skills.   It could be possible that slower college play and lazy coaching never stressed speed and conditioning off the snap. I like to think that agility and weight training at the professional level can get him to increase the speed. Footwork is pure practice though.
StLouisRams,35ido0,FaulktheBlueRedbird,4,Mon May 11 02:00:13 2015 UTC,Alright i'm about to make a bold statement. Sean Mannion will be the Rams starting quarterback by week 8 and NOT because of injury.
StLouisRams,35ido0,flashpanther,14,Sun May 10 19:14:32 2015 UTC,then that must mean the Rams are sucking.... fuck
StLouisRams,35ido0,RamsWillFly,6,Sun May 10 19:34:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I'm an OSU student now and he could barely handle PAC12 defenses, he would get absolutely decimated in the NFL."
StLouisRams,35ido0,GoSomaliPirates,3,Sun May 10 21:06:45 2015 UTC,"As exciting as that would be, I hope it doesn't happen. I just don't think he is NFL ready."
StLouisRams,35ido0,One_Half_Hamster,3,Sun May 10 19:21:55 2015 UTC,No way Fisher would put him in if Austin Davis and Case Keenum are available.
StLouisRams,35ido0,bretris,4,Mon May 11 01:20:39 2015 UTC,Hopefully he gets to sit and learn for a few years. Very few QBs get to wait anymore so it'll be advantageous to him to let the game slow down rather being thrust into the starting role. I've heard he's Matt Schaub ish but I see him as more of a Jay Cutler (So take that as you want it).
StLouisRams,35ido0,Areyoumyfriend,3,Sun May 10 18:12:23 2015 UTC,I don't think he has jay cutler's arm. Hardly anyone does. I'm thinking Schaub or Kerry Collins.
StLouisRams,35ido0,frankoftank,1 point,Sun May 10 22:03:28 2015 UTC,Not too Schaubby
StLouisRams,35ido0,BrawndoTTM,4,Tue May 12 23:21:29 2015 UTC,Potential: Franchise QB. Really any QB has that potential.  Realistic: I'd say starting QB.
StLouisRams,35ido0,daedalus000,2,Sun May 10 19:34:06 2015 UTC,"I think he at least has the potential for a sweet nickname, so I hope he does well to achieve that.  Like Mannion the Cannion!  I'd be interested to see what people who have looked at him think.  From my understanding he's sort of like an early Brady - tall with good strong, throws, but not a mobile dude.  I could be way off and I still need to watch more tape on him, but yeah, hoping he pulls into a solid backup QB role at least."
StLouisRams,35ido0,ManSeannion,6,Sun May 10 18:07:14 2015 UTC,"While he was at OSU, we called him Man-onion because he made us cry."

StLouisRams,35ido0,TacoxOFxBell,1 point,Sun May 10 22:06:37 2015 UTC,His hands are too small.
StLouisRams,35ido0,diesel321,2,Mon May 11 03:06:58 2015 UTC,I don't see why this is the issue. Throwing is not his weak suit. From what I've heard his arm strength is one of the things we can build upon.
StLouisRams,35ido0,frankoftank,1 point,Mon May 11 03:22:37 2015 UTC,"Arm talent, smart guy, stand up gentleman, good not great mechanics, at times has horrible footwork. The footwork steams from getting a bit jumpy in the pocket, but he has the pose to stand in the pocket and make throws. Those things can be fixed. He has most of the tools needed to be good, but it will take a few years."
StLouisRams,35ido0,diesel321,1 point,Tue May 12 19:17:28 2015 UTC,"Alex Smith. Smart game manager, won't win games but won't lose them. Will be great match with the Rams power run offense and strong defense."
StLouisRams,35fozp,ZappaOMatic,4,Sat May 9 22:21:15 2015 UTC,"Eh, not his best work. His comic about our tie with the 49ers in 2012 was always my favorite Rams-related Draw Play."
StLouisRams,35fozp,CallOnTyrone,7,Sat May 9 22:48:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it would have been funnier if he'd just drawn this immediately after the fourth slide and left it at that."
StLouisRams,35fozp,Pike09,2,Sun May 10 00:23:30 2015 UTC,Precisely where I thought it was going

StLouisRams,35fi5x,One_Half_Hamster,5,Sat May 9 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you OP, he just really seems to have a good head on his shoulders. I know we didn't technically need a RB but I'm glad we got him. If Tre Mason can continue what he started last season there shouldn't be a rush to get him into a game ASAP or the 3 down back everyone seems to think he can be. I'm really optimistic about him, he can definitely make us the Rams of old, being the workhorse we know he can be. Let's just hope his knees hold up."

StLouisRams,35dcv2,birdmandersen,7,Sat May 9 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"I really hope this guy makes the team. What an inspirational story, and I can't imagine how well received he would be in the locker room. Maybe a practice squad season. Who knows!"
StLouisRams,35dcv2,The49ersBlow,4,Sat May 9 09:14:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't read the article before I clicked on the comments because my first reaction to the title of the post was, ""What the hell, they autographed his medals?

StLouisRams,35d7je,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,7,Sat May 9 04:32:12 2015 UTC,"Alexander is not going to make an impact.  If the coaching staff believed in him and his development, they wouldn't have gone out and traded for Mark Barron, a guy who fills the role Alexander was meant for.  I hope Joyner improves; he was so much fun to watch at FSU in college."
StLouisRams,35d7je,4Signs,11,Sat May 9 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"Alexander had nothing to do with the Barron trade. They just saw a first round talent, an elite talent in their eyes, and said ""If the price is right, we have to go get him"". Even if they loved their guys already on the roster, it's too good to pass up. It's not like they gave up a lot."

StLouisRams,35axgb,Maverick814,1 point,Sat May 16 11:47:04 2015 UTC,Hey guys...I ordered the shirts anyway...so got a few extras for those who want to gobble them up.
StLouisRams,35axgb,The_Wayward,11,Mon May 18 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"We need 20 commitments by 5/18 to get started! $17+shipping I'm a Gurley Man t-shirt design  I grew up about 20 minutes from where Todd Gurley played high-school football in NC. He's a hometown hero and the biggest prospect to come out of the area since Julius Peppers. I was hoping he'd land in Carolina, but things didn't work out. We had worked out this T-Shirt design with the thought he could land in Carolina or in a market that the Panthers have a strong tie to (I run CarolinaCatChronicles.com, a Panthers fan website, so there some teams that we have stronger natural ties to than others.  Anyway, I didn't want to give up on this project just because he didn't land at a team that I don't have a lot of personal ins to the market. So instead, I decided to launch a T-Shirt Campaign to hopefully mitigate the some of the financial risks. We're looking for 20 firm commitments by 5/18 to make the first run of tees. The assuring part about this is if we don't hit 20 purchases by 5/18 all purchases/commitments will be fully refunded.  I think it's a great design, and will be on a high quality shirt.

StLouisRams,35axgb,Hozze,2,Sat May 9 00:44:49 2015 UTC,"Yep. 17 to go. Today was day one. We'd appreciate any support ypu can give in helping meet this goal. Just to encourage you, I purchased a Facebook ad, so we have some additional skin in the game.   Any shares with Rams fans would go a long way. It's why we reached out to the Reddit sub. This is where we could use the help.   Thanks again guys. Oh side note, I dominated fantasy football whenever I had Marshall Faulk. By far my most favorite fantasy football player of all time."
StLouisRams,35axgb,Hozze,4,Sat May 9 03:48:32 2015 UTC,I would totally buy this if it was available in a small.

StLouisRams,35bm6l,The_Wayward,2,Fri May 8 19:58:36 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

Going to have to go with Donald. Quinn is our best player, but realistically he is going to be facing double-teams and/or holding on virtually every passing down, so that will limit him, but it will also open things up for the others. Aaron Donald 1 v 1 is a monster.    How do you think Fairly will fit in with the other boys?   I see him fitting in well. He didn't really come close to reaching his ceiling with the Lions, but a change of scenery may be just what the doctor ordered. Even if he plays the same way he did on the Lions though, depth is critical and the effect of keeping guys fresh should not be discounted.   Do we lead the league in sacks? If so how many do we get?   I think it's a distinct possibility. I think we can realistically get 60 if we come out of the gate strong (ie not like last season, whatever the hell that was).   Does ARod follow up on such a great season?   If you mean Donald, then yes   Chris Long's upcoming contract talks.   He's gone if he gets less than 10 sacks this year. He might be gone regardless unless he goes absolutely HAM though. It sucks because he's such a great guy and team leader, but as of now his performance isn't justifying his cap hit. I hope he proves me wrong though and demonstrates he deserves what he's getting."

StLouisRams,359kmi,bleedblue89,9,Fri May 8 15:55:58 2015 UTC,"There are some people in St. Louis who think there are better ways to spend $400 million.   One of them is the Police Chief:   ST. LOUIS (KMOX) – Faced with a nearly 18 percent spike in crime, St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson complains to aldermen he doesn’t have enough officers.  “I’m disappointed, discouraged, frustrated by the amount of violence that I’ve see in the city over the last year,” Dotson told the aldermanic Public Safety Committee. “The police officers have been doing their job.”  Dotson told the panel that for the first four months of the year, crime is up in several categories.  Among the statistics:  55 murders, an increase of 25 percent.  533 robberies, an increase of 42 percent.  1,067 aggravated assaults, an increase of 15.4 percent.  1,741 total person crimes, an increase of 21.6 percent.  1,226 burglaries, an increase of 23.5 percent.  3,850 larcenies, an increase of 15.8 percent.  1,085 vehicle thefts, an increase of 14.5 percent.  7,940 total crimes, an increase of 17.7 percent.  Aldermen peppered the chief with questions about his methods, including his decision to reshuffle the established police districts and deploy surges of officers to “hot spots” to deal with changing crime patterns.  Alderman Antonio French called Dotson’s hot-spot policing “whack a mole policing,” suggesting it hasn’t done much good.  Dotson responded that 911 calls are up 11 percent, and he says officers are doing more work than a year ago.  “Arrests, year to date, are up 7 percent,” Dotson said. “Our officers have seen a 7 percent increase in arrests, and those are for the violent categories.”  At times during the two-hour hearing, Dotson admitted the obvious – that the crime rate in St. Louis has outpaced the ability of the existing police force to keep up.  “I don’t have the resources,” Dotson told the panel.  Currently, aldermen are considering a plan to ask voters to raise some taxes and fees to fund the hiring of 180 more officers. But that could take two years to result in more officers on the street.   It's all about priorities."

It's essentially pay-to-play: you ""gift"" our party some money, and we'll pay more attention to your issue. It happens in local politics more often than people realize, especially with small businesses, location moves, zoning, and the like.  I'm not sure what the political donation rules in MO are in relation to candidates and their associated fundraising entities, but I don't think Kronke or any of his people would donate to this guy at the risk of media finding out. I would think that this politician has a political or personal project that he wants pushed through and Kroenke has the connects to make it happen. Quid pro quo."
StLouisRams,359kmi,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Fri May 8 16:17:00 2015 UTC,"I doubt he has any legal grounds anymore to contest this.   First, I don't think this issue lies within the purview of the Missouri General Assembly, let alone any individual State House Reps or Senators.   From my understanding, the power to reallocate the existing municipal bonds from the EJD to the North Riverfront Stadium does not involve the General Assembly's involvement. It is a legal power of the Executive Office, not the General Assembly, to do so. This understanding is based on the framework with which these municipal bonds were underwritten.   Second, the General Assembly has already approved the State Budget. The ratification of the State Budget was the moment when this issue was brought before the General Assembly, including this Senator, and it was at this moment when he had the opportunity to filibuster. Quite simply, this Senator's opportunity to filibuster has already passed; he's already missed his moment to object.   Legally speaking, I don't think this Senator has any real standing, even if he attempts to filibuster.   Plus, I don't think the General Assembly can retroactively cancel out the legality of any previously-issued bond documents. Therefore, threats levied ""subject to appropriation"" are empty, noting that any negation of existing municipal bonds would cause incredible damage to the State of Missouri's credit ratings. Or, if they try to cancel out existing bonds, then Missouri bonds risk being considered junk bonds. That's a much bigger risk to the State than the ramifications of a legal bond reallocation.   TL/DR: Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
StLouisRams,359kmi,SoulardSTL,4,Fri May 8 18:02:21 2015 UTC,"Not quite.  Nixon can extend the bonds, sure, but the GA has to appropriate (choose to fund) those bonds.  Also, there is this thing out there where people seem to think the bonds are a state debt...THE BONDS ARE NOT STATE DEBT.  The AG of MO wrote Sen Silvey a letter saying as much.  In his radio interview, Schaaf specifically said the bonds are NOT BACKED BY THE FULL FAITH/CREDIT of MO.  https://twitter.com/RyanSilvey/status/583669681816473601  So yeah, considering Sens. Silvey/Schaaf/Richards threatened to not appropriate the bonds that would be pretty big deal as the stadium wouldnt receive the state funding if it happened.  Heck, even the mere suggestion they wont appropriate the bonds will make issuing those bonds more difficult/expensive.    Now in the end he may just be grandstanding but IF Schaaf is telling the truth, that could very well complicate things."

StLouisRams,359kmi,SoulardSTL,0,Fri May 8 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, what I read in the Attorney General’s letter to Senator Silvey backs up my point, but from a slightly different angle…   The Missouri General Assembly first established the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority in 1988 (§67.650-58 RsMO). The General Assembly created the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority as an autonomous, self-administered entity within the umbrella of Missouri’s government, effectively creating it to be separate from it. Therefore, after creating it, the General Assembly does not directly control it. It has oversight, but not administrative powers. Macro, not micro.   The real influence of the General Assembly here would be the power to call for the dissolution of the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority as a whole. I have neither read nor heard anything along the lines of the General Assembly calling for the dissolution of the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority.   Scale: That would be akin to the General Assembly dissolving the Department of Economic Development.   Concurrently, the discussion at hand is not whether or not §67.657 RsMO allows for the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority to issue its own bonds, as the Attorney General noted in his letter to Senator Silvey. What is at hand is the extension of the bonds which already exist.   These are the municipal bonds which the General Assembly originally created in 1988. From my understanding, these bonds are no longer controllable by the Legislature but may be adapted by the Executive, that the bonds’ original 1988 creation included language which allows the Executive the power to extend them in such a manner as that being currently contemplated by Governor Nixon.   Note: I’m not going to fully review Rice v. Ashcroft (Mo.App.E.D. 1991) in this analysis. Anyone who cares to provide insight to the court’s decision at that time to contemporary underwriting powers, if any can be found, go for it.   Basically, the 1988 Missouri General Assembly created the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority, and it separately authorized municipal bonds to fund the Edward Jones Dome via the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority. The General Assembly is not currently in control of either the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority or these municipal bonds. Statements by certain Senators that the General Assembly controls either in the manners discussed are real stretches.   Consider that the Hotel/Motel Tax is the primary funding mechanism behind the EJD bonds via Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority. Spradlin v. City of Fulton (Mo.1996) discusses the inherent difference between General Obligation Bonds and Revenue Bonds. For the EJD municipal bonds at hand, their revenue sources are self-generating. They are indirect revenue bonds and are in fact further from the purview of the General Assembly that they would be if the EJD bonds were actually general obligation bonds.   The letter cited in the Tween from the AG does not provide a framework for whether or not the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority can release future bonds. The issue remains the legal, authorized, already existing Edward Jones Dome bonds.   Since these bonds are under the purview of the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority, where would the General Assembly have standing to appropriate in the manner described by Senator Schaaf? Does he want to kill off the convention center authority because he wants to be able to control how they manage their budget? Now, I don’t question these Senators saying what they see is the truth in their pursuits; I respectfully question if they know what the fuck they’re talking about.   Meanwhile, “full faith and credit” is another issue altogether. I have not heard of any instance where the State’s “full faith and credit” be incorporated in any ways whatsoever towards the North Riverfront Stadium’s construction. It had never been utilized in any ways (i.e. guarantor’s statement) towards the Edward Jones Dome’s construction.   The potential discussion of “full faith and credit” is moot for being an entirely different issue that has never existed towards any of these conversations.   What is at hand is the State of Missouri’s credit status should they challenge the State’s previously existing obligations. They’re already showing their apparent willingness to question the obligations outstanding that the State of Missouri has, and even those of the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority which they do not control. Generally speaking, should the State release any bonds, then subsequently decide to no longer recognize these bonds, the State risks itself with near certainty to a downgrade of its credit ratings. This holds if one General Assembly hates the bonds a previous General Assembly passed; what was passed as an obligation then, is respected as an obligation now. Retroactive governance does not work, especially not in money.   The fight is not whether the General Assembly can reappropriate existing obligations. It’s whether the Executive has the power to retask these existing municipal bonds, which from everything I’ve read so far points to yes.   TL/DR: These Senators are fighting the wrong fights."
StLouisRams,359kmi,revolver066,2,Fri May 8 19:07:46 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the analysis but the fact is the MO GA votes to appropriate the bonds every year.  They already do this, its already in their power.  In fact, Nixon explicitly said the MO GA still has to appropriate those bonds.    And like Silvey said in those tweets it is NOT a state debt.  And like Schaaf says in this interview the bonds are NOT backed by the full faith credit of MO (which I take to mean, the bonds are not backed fully by the state of MO like a general obligation bond).  Also, I fail to see how it is ""moot"" and an ""entirely different issue"" when Schaaf himself brought it up, and this thread after all is about...Schaaf's comments. But anyways..  (http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/full-faith-credit.asp)   So if its NOT a state debt, how can it affect the states credit rating?  To simplify:  Yes, the executive can extend bonds. But its also true the MO GA can refuse to appropriate it.  We can agree on this right?   So the issue becomes...would refusing to pay those bonds affect the states credit ratings?  Silvey's tweet seems to suggest to me it doesnt.    And I'd ask you..if its NOT state debt, how would it affect the states credit rating?  OH, and remember the hotel/motel tax you refer to does NOT pay for ANY of the states portion. The state portion all comes from General revenues."
StLouisRams,359kmi,SoulardSTL,0,Fri May 8 20:37:17 2015 UTC,"And I appreciate your approach to this as well, focused on the framework rather than passions one way or the other…   The big thing is that the EJD bonds already exist and legally may be extended without the involvement of the General Assembly. If this is possible, and lawful, then it seems difficult for Senator Schaaf to attempt to amend its machinations already effected.   Should Missouri decide to selectively not recognize the validity of existing debentures, then we would be denying our legal obligations. The credit agencies would crucify us, and we'd be actively converting our own bonds into junk.   The General Assembly does have appropriation powers for new bonds. Same time, I do not believe the Missouri General Assembly votes every year to continue to respect the validity of each preexisting obligations that have already been issued, at least not with any substantive discourse. They may pass new bonds every year, but they don't have to re-pass what's already been approved by the GA before.   The term Appropriate should connotate another word: Default. Should the GA attempt to unilaterally amend any preexisting bond’s payments to bondholders (i.e. non-appropriation), then they would be defaulting State bonds. That's a very big risk.   In a real sense, the GA has the power to deny appropriation towards preexisting debentures and send the State into default on its bonds in the same way a person recognizes they have the power to commit suicide. Which of course they do, but if you hear them talking about it, you pray that this is more a shout for attention than a serious desire to kill themselves.   Silvey and Schaaf can speak about misappropriation to existing obligations, but they'd be killing what they espouse to love. And this is coming from a fiscal conservative redditor.   The unreliability of Missouri to recognize its preexisting obligations is a risk to MO's credit ratings because of the potential selective nature of MO to deny certain bonds certain individual politicians do not like, increasing total volatility while decreasing confidence; municipal ""political risk"" at its worst iteration.  Assuming he's not politically ""suicidal"", I doubt Schaaf would ever really move to have the General Assembly default on its preexisting obligations (incl. the EJD bonds), a very big risk, because he doesn't like the Governor's legal power over the EJD bonds. This is a nuclear option to influence a power that he doesn't hold, the power to amend the EJD bonds, which lies within the power of the Executive as primary oversight of the Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority. Plus, it's a nuclear option that most likely would miss the target, damaging the State's credit reputation while not impacting the Governor's powers over the EJD bonds."
StLouisRams,359kmi,revolver066,3,Fri May 8 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"MM love me some rational discourse brother. Good stuff.   It may be a bluff, no doubt, but here is Silvey's language:   ""Silvey said that if Nixon went ahead, bondholders might be taking a risk. Based on a recent attorney general’s opinion, the bonds would be “technically a debt of the sports authority, not a debt of the state,” Silvey said.  And each year, legislators would decide whether to provide the state’s share of the bond payment. With no advance pledge from legislators, payments for a new stadium could be in jeopardy, he said.  “Because of the ‘subject to appropriations’ clause, we’re not technically obligated to pay,” Silvey said. “This is an issue that will not go away if they move forward” without a legislative or public vote.""  http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/legislature-backs-off-banning-public-funds-for-new-stadium/article_c3f3fc17-42ef-5e07-a536-729bb396c419.html  So the way I see it is, (and correct me if I'm wrong)...  The RSA (not the state) issues bonds. The State (along w/ the city and/or county) enters into an agreement with the RSA saying we will pay you X amount to cover the bonds you issued *subject to appropriation.  Silvey is saying since our contract is with the RSA and since it contains the clause (subject to appropriation), if we DONT appropriate it, we are:  a. not violating any agreement with the RSA since the agreement specifically states its subject to appropriation; and b. it will NOT affect the states credit rating because the bonds are a debt of the RSA and not the State.  Now, the big question for me is...would this indirect refusal hurt the states credit rating even though its not the state issuing the bonds/backing the bonds?    That I dont know, and is probably the key question to determining if Silvey/Schaaf are bluffing IMO.   Schaaf has mentioned that his goal is to make sure that when the RSA's goes to solicit these bonds, they have to disclose anything material related to these bonds, and a Senator or Seantors threatening to refuse to appropriate those bonds may make it more difficult/expensive to issue those bonds.    So maybe its all a threat to scare off bondholders.    In fact, Schaaf has been saying that since January.    ""St. Joseph Sen. Rob Schaaf said there is no guarantee the Senate would approve stadium bond issue payments that Nixon did not receive legislative approval for.  Shaaf said it would put fear in those who sell bonds. “When the issuers of bonds see us taking this step, that they would then not want to issue those bonds,” he said.""  http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2015/01/29/loud-no-from-missouri-senate-concerning-new-stl-football-stadium/  More importantly though, I think what Schaaf will ACTUALLY do is almost moot, since Nixon has said they wont extend bonds w/out a team commitment first.  So the question in my mind is...what impact if any will Schaaf's comments have with existing bondholders and the NFL in determining whether this is a fundamental roadblock or not.  And again, I have no idea.   So I think Schaaf's comments are most meaningful ex ante, since everything else would have to fall into place (NFL commitment, team owner commitment, land, city financing, etc) before the bonds were ever issued and subject to appropriation anyways."
StLouisRams,359kmi,SoulardSTL,-1,Fri May 8 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"Thing is, the 1988 Missouri General Assembly passed these municipal bonds, with full appropriation, and then bequeathed authority over these bonds to the RSA (then the Convention and Visitors Commission). The North Riverfront Stadium being built with proceeds from these preexisting bonds changes the game here, because it means it’ll be doing so with prior approval from the 1988 GA that the 2015 GA cannot retroactively amend without I would think a supermajority.   I say the risk to MO’s credit rating is that we could be viewed as volatile and unreliable should they succeed in misappropriation of existing obligations, pursuing active defaults in the name of partisan gamesmanship, lack of better words here. It comes down to how an appropriation could come up… If they’re looking to obstruct to prevent the legislation from reaching a vote, that is highly volatile, but only if it needs the vote to exist in the first place. Since we’re dealing with bonds that already exist, I would think they’d need an overwhelming majority of the General Assembly to vote with them to negate existing legislation in contravention of established obligations, a consensus that I don’t think they could ever get yet could be so damaging if ever attained that MO bonds could turn into junk overnight.   When Moody’s, Fitch, and S&P rate bonds, they want reliability, not partisan circus shows promoting volatility. Such volatility can bring down credit ratings if substantive. That’s the most present risk. And I really believe the rest of the MO GOP would stomp them before they allow them to screw up MO’s bond ratings going forward.   Yet, this is all academic theorizing based on political BS.   The more I reflect on this, the more I think it’s just some guys trying to make political headwinds for themselves by being contrarian objectivists. “Look at me! Look at me! I’m from St. Joseph, and we had the pony express!”  The biggest real impact I can see is that Silvey and Schaaf will attempt to filibuster these bonds’ continuations under what likely would be omnibus bond appropriation legislation. Then, they’ll be shut down by the MO GOP for acting unilaterally and against party consensus, noting that MO Speaker of the House John Diehl (R-STL County) is the guy who struck Senator Silvey’s line-item amendations to exclude any potential funding of the North Riverfront Stadium from the State’s budget a couple weeks ago, thus allowing funding to be made via the Governor’s pen.   If the Rams decide to stay in STL, with the NFL throwing G-4 money with them towards the North Riverfront Stadium, and these guys throw a hissy fit, the MO GOP would look like assholes and bash these guys upside the head for giving them a bad reputation. In the end, this is about retaining a local business and employer within the State while fostering economic development.   Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.   Solid conversation."
StLouisRams,359kmi,revolver066,1 point,Fri May 8 21:46:52 2015 UTC,"I think I agree in that after the bonds would be extended, meaning the NFL has committed/land secured/city financing secured, team owner commited, etc (altho it requires an issuance of new bonds with new terms, new payoff date, etc) that it probably wouldnt amount to much.  However...  If Schaaf/Silvey/Richard's statements cast doubt/fear into the bondholders (the stadium bonds were already downgraded for being non essential and subject to appropriation anyways), then it could make it more expensive/tougher to secure those bonds in the first place.  ""Even the suggestion from legislators that they might refuse to pass a budget with annual bond payments for a new stadium could lead to increased costs on any such bond measure, finance experts said.""  http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/alex-stuckey/nixon-official-state-can-spend-for-stadium-without-legislative-vote/article_3ab09064-9d43-58c1-a499-d5b10e0ebd60.html  Considering we dont even know how much the stadium will cost, the land will cost, where the 6mm county gap will come from and if the city will participate without a vote, any undue certainty/expenses may be a non trivial obstacle for the stadium.  Further, if the NFL looks at this as not having the requisite political support (or if they are just looking for an excuse to screw STL-no idea what the odds are on that) then this Silvey/Schaaf play could prove significant.    In the end you may be right that it signifies nothing...but if the bonds are more expensive, and if the NFL/NFL owners look at this in a negative light, Silvey's/Schaaf's play may prove extremely significant. Then again..maybe not.  But like you said its all academic theorizing/guesswork at this point.  Good convo. At least we should know in 6 months or so."
StLouisRams,359kmi,revolver066,0,Fri May 8 22:27:15 2015 UTC,"Just saw your messages on here... Agree that the Schaaf/Silvey effect could be higher interest payments from these bonds than normally would be mandated because of their willingness to create political risk, increasing volatility while questioning long-term funding viability, and decreasing the credit ratings of these bonds. I don't think they have any real support behind them in the MO GA, nothing near enough votes to prevent funding from being allocated to the North Riverfront Stadium, but they could make a stink.   The big risk comes from members of the MO GA cutting off funding from preexisting bonds. This goes for far more than the Rams and NFL in STL, and it is in the macro context I'm seeing this. Take out the stadium... Say we had a hospital being built in Fulton with State bonds. Say there are some state senators who are against it for some reason and they act to cut funding to these bonds' coupon payments, effectively cutting out the investors. The effects of these actions would chill investors across the US to MO municipal bonds, where people would question the viability of investing in MO debentures. That's the argument being presented by Schaaf/Silvey, just in a different context, and I don't think the rest of the MO GA, including the MO GOP, would let this progress to real action before they reign them back into the fold.   Otherwise, I don't have any real fears of S&P, or Moody's, or Fitch decreasing MO's credit because a couple state senators don't like the governor's power to extending certain bonds towards certain outcomes previously written into the bond documents. And I don't think the rest of the MO GA will sit back idly while they potentially risk the State's bond ratings. Hence, the Macbeth reference.   Looking out there, I think there is far more influence on what will happen on this issue in San Diego and Oakland than from St. Joseph, and that there are so many variables out there right now on everything in these stadium issues that I don't think the actions of one state senator can sway the total dynamic. They're making names for themselves by latching on to a big, sexy issue, and making noise.   Addn: Check out this link from the /r/nfl thread. Apparently, Schaaf started a Twitter poll on stadium support vs. opposition. It was overwhelmingly pro-stadium, I think 300+ to 10. Schaaf then erased everything and said polls like the ones he was running are inherently biased, to discredit his lost argument."
StLouisRams,359kmi,AsaKurai,1 point,Fri May 8 22:37:24 2015 UTC,"Also found this on the bonds which is kinda interesting in a nerdy way:  http://finance.yahoo.com/news/fitch-rates-board-public-buildings-220200377.html  So State general obligation bonds are AAA rating (those backed by the full faith and credit of MO).  The state appropriation bonds (so I guess its in the bond langauge itself that has the ""subject to appropriation language"") are generally rated one notch below at AA+ because of the appropriation process.  And the RCSCA (stadium) bonds are one notch below that at AA ""due to the non-essentiality of the funded project, a sports, entertainment and convention facility.""  So I guess the argument would be that the states appropriation bonds in the future (probably not the General obligation bonds) may be affected because in this one instance the MO GA didn't fund it.  Although its noteworthy this rating agency already lowered the credit rating simply based on the fact its ""nonessential"", meaning they already took into account it could be the most precarious of the state appropriation bonds.    Schaaf's comments may make it more expensive to borrow because of his comments (if potential sellers/rating agencies take his comments somewhat seriously)."

StLouisRams,3532w9,corbilm,3,Wed May 6 18:46:20 2015 UTC,I think him and Britt are gonna tear it up together this year.  If our run game improves (which I assume it will) it will help open them up.
StLouisRams,3532w9,corbilm,4,Wed May 6 19:35:26 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but that injury was extensively bad. Having your rotator cuff torn is no laughing matter, it takes a serious athlete to come back and perform decent. So do expect him to come back and make an impact? Yes. Do I think he puts up 1,000 yards? No way!  If he feels solid by the end of the season, then he could be a huge threat if we make the playoffs or going into next season. But as of right now, I don't think they've said he would be ready by the season opener. I think that's about when they expect him back, but it could take longer."
StLouisRams,3532w9,corbilm,2,Wed May 6 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, although he went down week 8 (I think) he has had a bit of time to recover. Not being sarcastic just trying to genuinely ask if by chance you know. What is the recovery time on a rotator cuff injury?"
StLouisRams,3532w9,ItsBiggy,0,Wed May 6 18:36:10 2015 UTC,"It can last for a while, because it's easy to tear it a second time. In that first 6 months, you have to be extremely careful.  But I've also heard Jeff fisher say something like it was about the shoulder injury you could've had in that situation... I'm assuming there were more complications than just a single tear, possibly an ACL separation too or something along those lines or it could just be as simple as an extremely extensive rotator cuff tear, but either way... I expect them to ease him into our line up, cause he isn't going to start the season jamming DBs."
StLouisRams,3532w9,corbilm,1 point,Wed May 6 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information! I was looking at an article, it says that he had surgery to repair 3 torn ligaments (woah). Camps are probably out of the question participation wise but Fisher is hopefully for him to be ready by week one. With seeing that i don't think he'll see too many snaps right off the bat, but I'm still going to remain optimistic about his return."
StLouisRams,3532w9,ItsBiggy,0,Wed May 6 18:59:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah... By season end or playoffs hopefully, he should be very solid. Hopefully he is solid with the playbook and his mechanics."
StLouisRams,3532w9,corbilm,4,Wed May 6 19:11:18 2015 UTC,"This is a little on the pessimistic side. Tearing up your shoulder leaves you a lot better off than tearing up your knee. Common recovery time for a shoulder is 3 months and even if it's the worst of shoulder injuries, it would only take 6 months of rehab to be close to 100%. (Brian Quick is getting the BEST rehab as a professional athlete) And Fisher says he could be back by OTA's so idk why he couldn't have a 1,000 yard season"
StLouisRams,3532w9,grizwald85,-3,Wed May 6 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"Bradford sat out most of his junior season in college for a shoulder injury, he separated his acl which is a ""shoulder injury."" And fisher said specifically BQ did about everything you could go do to a shoulder in that injury.  Plus I'm just now hearing its three ligament tear which is very extensive. If he also had stuff that we don't know about... Then you or I have no idea how long his return could have us waiting.   Don't let webMD be your guide to NFL or football recovery. Not to mention saying he could have 1,000 yards of more of a ""hopeful"" type of belief. http://imgur.com/DsnlFis check his stats. I'm not being pessimistic, I'm being a realist."
StLouisRams,3532w9,corbilm,3,Thu May 7 06:15:28 2015 UTC,"I'm speaking from experience, not Web MD. Btw Bradford tore the AC joint in his throwing shoulder. You're comparing apples to oranges. And I never said he would get to 1,000, I was just saying that it is absurd to say that he can't get there because of an injury that I have lived through which felt great after 6 months of rehab.(Yes I played football and yes it was,""As bad as it can get."")"
StLouisRams,3532w9,corbilm,0,Thu May 7 06:49:07 2015 UTC,Acromioclavicular ligament.  Sorry I didn't clarify that for you.

You're just being obliviously self-biased in your statements. Plus, you keep trying to tell me that ""Bradford separated his AC joint"" which if you're not familiar with medical terminology... Is graded in 3 levels the first two are classified as an acromioclavicular ligament tear (hence the acl tear) and the third is the coracoclavicular ligaments tear.     So when you're saying is separated his AC Joint, you're being vague...  Again I know this because I have suffered this injury and I have been around this injury many times during my rehab process and when I worked as a technician for a physician.   Here is a photo of my reseparated shoulder: http://i.imgur.com/4f8V7fJ.jpg   Edit: what's funny is, I didn't read your article till after I wrote this and you probably should go back and read the part about grading the level of injury.  COUGH turns out, I was right. Just hit Google and search these big words I've been using. COUGH but it's cool... You have a nice day!"
StLouisRams,3532w9,Samu-ELBradford,0,Thu May 7 17:52:19 2015 UTC,"You only mentioned the acromioclavicular ligament. Bradford tore his acromioclavicular ligament and coracoclavicular ligament so it's easier to call a grade III a,""separated AC joint,"" because the whole joint is hanging with no support. You should not focus on the details as much and realize that you compared Bradford's destroyed throwing shoulder to Brian Quick's. They are completely different players with completely different functions on the field."
StLouisRams,3532w9,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,3,Thu May 7 18:26:19 2015 UTC,I think he's going to be a monster this year.  Not monster like 1600 yards but like a solid sub 1k receiver with a bunch of red zone TDs and a great run blocker.
StLouisRams,3532w9,alderaan_never4get,1 point,Wed May 6 21:32:02 2015 UTC,ABSOLUTELY. Since we drafted Quickie I've been waiting for the kind of season he was having last year. Unfortunate injury and terrible timing. But I am totally on borad the hype train  he will be back way better now with a good Qb under center. Watch out for Stedman Bailey too. Love the kid and he can run some good routes and adjust to the ball pretty well.

First, if he doesn't make an impact in the NFL, the likelihood of him staying with the Rams drops tremendously.  Second, he was apparently not happy that his number had to be in the 30s, so I assume he will probably change his number to something he wants as soon as he gets the chance. When I get a jersey I like to get a good amount of years out of it with the player being active on the team."
StLouisRams,34wuej,One_Half_Hamster,2,Tue May 5 06:09:02 2015 UTC,Tell me about it. I bought a Bradford jersey about two weeks before preseason last year.

For the people in the business of building a winning football team, affection and emotion are often the enemies. Over the long haul, cold-hearted calculation and pragmatism typically yield much more fruitful results.   A great counterpoint to ""analysts"" and fans calling our draft poor essentially because it was unsexy.  To hell with that - bring on the beefy linemen!"
StLouisRams,34v8v6,daedalus000,4,Mon May 4 21:43:11 2015 UTC,"""Options are good,"" Caldwell later explained. ""It gives you a lot of flexibility. It allows you to take advantage of a trade opportunity, too.""  And sure enough, a few minutes after the first round's conclusion, Snead (whom Caldwell succeeded as Dimitroff's right-hand man in Atlanta) called to offer a deal: The 41st overall selection and running back Zac Stacy, in exchange for the Jags' 36th pick. Stacy, made expendable by the selection of Gurley, had a productive rookie campaign in 2013 before being pushed into a lesser role last season.   I wonder who the Rams wanted at 36? Since we ended up trading down from 41, it's fair to assume this player was taken before us. Those picks, in order:   36 - TJ Yeldon - RB - JAX 37 - Devin Smith - WR - NYJ 38 - Preston Smith - DE - WAS 39 - Eddie Goldman - DT - CHI 40 - Dorial Green-Beckham - WR - TEN   I would guess it was for DGB, as we probably wouldn't be trading up for a RB, DE, or DT there. Funny how these things can play out."
StLouisRams,34v8v6,WaywardWes,4,Mon May 4 23:39:58 2015 UTC,"I think it was Devin Smith.  Foles played really well with Desean Jackson,and Devin Smith fills the same role very effectively."

StLouisRams,34ubiu,Thonked,8,Mon May 4 16:59:47 2015 UTC,3rd round isn't low cost. 7th round is low cost and that's where I wanted him.   Can't fault the Rams or other NFL teams for not drafting him though
StLouisRams,34ubiu,diesel321,3,Mon May 4 17:02:06 2015 UTC,"Low cost is relative, and La'el is 1st round talent. Although I'm sure if he stayed he wouldve been drafted before the 7th."
StLouisRams,34ubiu,The_Wayward,2,Mon May 4 17:29:04 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly confident no one took a shot on La'el late simply out of respect to him. Someone would have made a jump. Considering what we know and the low likelihood of him being implicated, letting him make it to UDFA was the best thing that could have happened for him financially after he fell out of the second. Teams knew they couldn't take him early just in case something came from the legal issues, and all chose not to disrespect him on a 6 figure, 7th round salary. Pure speculation, but what I believe to be true."
StLouisRams,34ubiu,big_fig,5,Mon May 4 17:46:55 2015 UTC,"Im fairly confident no one took a shot on him because he stated publicly that he'd prefer to enter the draft next year after day 1, which would mean him sitting out the entire year if you had drafted him."

StLouisRams,34ubiu,big_fig,3,Mon May 4 20:18:49 2015 UTC,The only way he could be eligible for the following years draft would be to get drafted and then sit out entire year I believe.

I held out hope of hearing his name every single pick.     I'd have liked him in the spot where we drafted Mannion. Just late enough that you're hedged against the possibility that his legal situation gets worse, while being a great steal for talent level and staying early enough that he doesn't feel quite so aggrieved by the situation. It would have been worth the draft pick just to keep him from going to Seattle or SF on an UDFA contract when he's cleared, which you fucking know is going to happen now because fuck us."
StLouisRams,34ubiu,vrock627,1 point,Mon May 4 19:30:26 2015 UTC,"Nobody took a shot on him as a giant 32 team ""fuck you"" to a guy who promised to hold out if he was drafted past the 3rd.  Collins wanted to get drafted late so he could become eligible for the 2016 draft.  The NFL got together and blackballed him, which I think was a smart move.  The circumstances surrounding the murder are far too suspicious right now to risk a high pick on him.  If he's truly 100% not involved in the murder than he's just the unluckiest guy on earth.  But common sense should tell you it seems very fishy."

A franchise which may or may not be moving in the next one to three years.   Edit: Haters gonna hate, but it's the truth. I'm not trying to disparage the Rams.  But Gurley is 20, he was ages 5 -7 during the Greatest Show on Turf era.  The Rams are more than 50 games under .500 since Gurley turned 10.  Over three whole seasons of losses under .500.  The only thing that's a step up for him is the paycheck.  The Rams aren't the only team this would be true of btw."

StLouisRams,34rl0h,fake_sagan,11,Sun May 3 23:22:01 2015 UTC,"People seem to think that these OL guys are bad because they are not top pass protection linemen.  But they were not brought in to block for an aggressive passing game.  They are all excellent run blockers and maulers who can open up holes for Gurley and Mason as the team transitions to a ground and pound offense.  Foles and Mannion both can serve as game managers that are capable of calling and executing the play action as well as minimizing risks in the red zone.  Look at the close games we lost the last few years because of poor red zone execution (often Schotty's fault, admittedly) and this offense makes a ton of sense."
StLouisRams,34rl0h,TB_Punters,6,Mon May 4 02:10:51 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, it was apparent that Fisher and Snead had a plan and these linemen fit it. If there pass protection wasn't amazing in college, it does not mean that they cannot develop into a good tackle. I trust they know what they are doing, and I hope their plan pans out. With Schotty gone I could see this team going in a new direction and winning quite a few more games based on late game goal line decisions, I assume thats why they invested so high in Gurley. I feel as if for the first time in a while we will have a true identity on offense."
StLouisRams,34rl0h,Gaines_train,1 point,Mon May 4 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"I'm less concerned about their pass protecting than I am about the fact that they are all slow as shit. Being ridiculously huge is all you need in college, but speed kills in the NFL. That said, I trust that Fisher knows more about football than I do so he probably thought of that."
StLouisRams,34rl0h,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Mon May 4 12:21:05 2015 UTC,"I would argue that our offense for the past 5 years at least has always been a ground and pound offense. We focus on receivers and QB like many nfl fans but we must remember that, in recent seasons: 2013 Bradford was the chosen one and once he went down we were in the dumps...then suddenly a Zac Stacy appeared and made Kellen Clemons look decent. Our run game in 2013 is what gave us any kind of an edge offensively. In 2014 Tre Mason and Benny Cunningham opened up our offense for what it's worth. Shaun Hill and Austin Davis are lack luster to say the least...but they made some big plays BECAUSE our RBs were a real threat. Britt signing on and Quick's flash of brilliance are an footnote IMO.   Our pass game is mostly hindered by the line. But we have always focused on pounding the ball with runners and setting up for play action.  If these new prospects can open holes for a RB we are set this season. Mason, Gurley, and Benny are going to wreck house. Then when the defense cheats up Britt and Quick and Tavon and Bailey and Cook and Harkey and Foles are going to have a field day.   Quick Edit: the only time we weren't ground and pounding was when we were down, which is often early in the game...at which point Schotty's dumbass would devise the dink and dunk short pass game which helped nothing but boost our already horrid QB numbers...those deep routes weren't there and we didn't have a line good enough to protect for a long play anyway. Thought this should also be added to the discussion.  That's my prediction. Our pass game won't be our forte, but it's certainly going to surprise some casual NFL fans this year IMO."
StLouisRams,34rl0h,price-iz-right,8,Mon May 4 20:16:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, we are great at developing linemen. We have turned shit hole players into useable starters so I hope you understand that."
StLouisRams,34rl0h,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,4,Mon May 4 01:07:53 2015 UTC,True. People forget that the Raiders basically threw Barksdale away because they thought he was worthless. We developed him into a solid tackle. We can do the same for these guys.
StLouisRams,34rl0h,BrawndoTTM,2,Mon May 4 12:19:55 2015 UTC,Don't forget barry Richardson? The worthless veteran we got for the jets who became a serviceable starter.

StLouisRams,34rl0h,SoulardSTL,1 point,Mon May 4 04:49:38 2015 UTC,"I love it. We're investing into an O-line that has needed help for many years, and doing so with giant men built & focused on making holes for runners. We match that structural investment with weapons that'll match the line and capitalize on these new opportunities. Gurley is an absolute badass RB who'll likely generate for years; partnered with Mason, the Rams will have one of the best running platoons in the league, plus Cunningham able to bust into goal-line walls.  For years, we've tried to create a pass-centric offense centered on Sam Bradford, who I think ownership desperately wanted to be a marquee player on par with Peyton Manning and Drew Brees. That didn't work, no matter how many WR rookies we picked up. Ironically, we did this when we should've picked up O-line support back then that could've kept Sam in a usable pocket instead of being so damn porous he was constantly taken down, leading to shell-shock and busted legs! Anyways, that's the past. Today, we're refocusing on the running game, a preference to grind out scores line-by-line instead of an aerial attack... while at the same time creating a line presence that'll allow for a QB to operate much more effectively than before. Our new line should be able to hold a usable pocket for Foles to easily ascend the Dalton Line and then some, with Mannion learning along the way.   Also for years, we've built up our defense into a formidable wall, one of the best in the League. This historical build-up of talent across our defense has allowed us to focus this year's draft so strongly on offense. 3 OTs and a Guard. Even if only half these picks turn out to be reasonable, the return they'll generate for the team as a whole will be very positive."
StLouisRams,34q02p,chemicalpoisons,18,Sun May 3 15:03:51 2015 UTC,"An A- seems pretty optimistic about this draft. Yes, dire needs were addressed but were they fulfilled? The only way to grade a draft at this point are all the big boards out there, and the rams reached for every pick except Gurley.   That being said, I hope they are right. If these linemen pan out, this will be huge."
StLouisRams,34q02p,_Randy_Magnum_,13,Sun May 3 16:12:35 2015 UTC,"The rams big board might not match other big boards. The rams were most interested in lineman who can run block. If a big board was rateing the olineman as pass blockers or overall lineman than the rams picks seem like more of a reach. As run blockers they picked some good guys. The rams also seemed to like guys who played at multiple spots on the line. Also mannion fits what the rams want more then Hurley or petty, the rams don't need an athletic qb in this system.   I think Sneed got a lot of what he wanted. He got his first pick of rbs and his first pick of 2nd tier qbs, he passed on some lineman that I liked and that were rated higher than the guy that he picked, so it is safe to assume that he coveted those guys. If they pan out is a whole different story. Remember two years ago when the rams were going to be a spread offense with tavon."
StLouisRams,34q02p,ptabs226,8,Sun May 3 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people are viewing this draft through the pass-happy NFL lens, which is perfectly understandable because that is the narrative that the league and ESPN have created.  As you say, Snead clearly had a plan to draft guys that fit a mold that is different from the mold most other teams are using.  I like this draft precisely because Fisher and Snead clearly have a plan to be a team that more closely resembles Georgia or Wisconsin rather than basically any modern NFL team.  Perhaps Andy Reid's Chiefs are the closest corollary to what it looks like Snisher are building."
StLouisRams,34q02p,TB_Punters,2,Sun May 3 18:28:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Our draft was unsexy to a lot of analysts simply because we didn't pick flashy pass protectors and opted for ""boring"" beefy road-graders.  I love it."

StLouisRams,34q02p,MisterDoctorAwesome,3,Sun May 3 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly any draft where we end up with 3 or so competent starters I am happy. Snisher have been delivering on this in their drafts and it looks like they will hve done so again this year, assuming that at least Gurley and 2 of our drafted OL are able to be better than the shitty players they are replacing (aside from Barksdale, we will likely miss him)."
StLouisRams,34q02p,One_Half_Hamster,3,Sun May 3 17:26:02 2015 UTC,This is Bleacher Report.  Do they rate anyone's draft as bad?
StLouisRams,34q02p,LLv2,2,Sun May 3 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"If anyone is interested Mel Kiper gave us a ""C"" on ESPN but you have to be an insider to see it. He gave us a ""C"" but said that if Gurley works out then obviously it could be a much better grade, he also liked our OL picks but said we could have got a better WR earlier."
StLouisRams,34q02p,AsaKurai,2,Mon May 4 05:24:00 2015 UTC,"It's always great to see someone say something nice about our team but it really means nothing at this point.  The first draft I ever followed closely was in '96 when we drafted Lawrence Phillips (RB), Eddie Kennison (WR), and Tony Banks (QB) and the next few days I was so happy to read people who gave us an 'A' grade because we had drafted our 'triplets' who would revamp our offense and lead us to the Super Bowl.  We got to the Super Bowl with a great offense just a few years later but none of these guys were on the team by then."
StLouisRams,34q02p,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Mon May 4 12:09:43 2015 UTC,Skeptical until I see some improvement on the field.  We drafted mostly linemen this draft and if none of the pan it out it will be a huge blunder. I can only hope Gurley rehabs well and reacts well with the NFL like Frank Gore did after his college injury.
StLouisRams,34q02p,FoxyZach,1 point,Sun May 3 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"So after spending an 8th overall pick on a 5'9"" slot receiver and giving one of the worst blocking TEs in the league a top 5 contract, we are now a run-first team?  I'm on board with the idea of being a running team, but Tavon and Jared Cook do not belong on that team."
StLouisRams,34q02p,jsgg556,1 point,Mon May 4 02:34:01 2015 UTC,"I can see Tavon becoming much more significant in the passing attack if we have a threatening run game. Needing time for run-oriented OL draftees to learn to pass block means short passes, slants. Tavon could end up with huge numbers in that role. Having a deadly ground AND air attack would be fantastic. Crossing my fingers."
StLouisRams,34q02p,ChalupaLoompa,1 point,Mon May 4 17:48:13 2015 UTC,"I give it a solid B or B+. Gurley is a big risk, but a lot of upside. I like our OL picks, and I think the QB we drafted has potential of being a decent pocket passer, and could be a good backup from the start with Foles."
StLouisRams,34r1js,Jocuhilarity,13,Sun May 3 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"This was a great draft for us, oline picks aren't exciting or flashy.  When you find yourself bored with the draft it's usually a good sign.   I think we'll be big and mauling on the front side."
StLouisRams,34r1js,bleedblue89,3,Sun May 3 20:56:02 2015 UTC,"Totally uninformed with your situation this year coming into the draft, but by the numbers, it looks like you guys are going to have a sick run game this year. You got the most O-linemen out of the draft (4). You've got Todd Gurley in the first who'll develop under Mason this year, followed by 3 OT's, and finally a guard in the 6th. Not sure how many of those four linemen are going to be starters, but new blood on the line is going to make the team better."
StLouisRams,34r1js,juicyja,2,Mon May 4 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"I think the problems is with most of the NFL now being dynamic receivers and strong passers, the moment the rams decided to stick to old school grit people don't understand."

I love the shift towards power running, while the rest the league is building up defences to stop the pass.  This is a team I'll be tuning in to watch on a regular basis this season :)"
StLouisRams,34r1js,moondoggle,0,Mon May 4 19:46:17 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with this. Sadly, i wont be voicing my opinion here (much) because doing so is instant downvote city. Tre Mason showed a lot of promise last year. To relegate him to a backup after not seeing what his full potential is isnt smart imo. Our line was terrible last year but he made things work.  Peat or even Parker wouldve done so much more for our team imo. On to mr stein, he just screams overly big RT thats going to get beat by speed pass rushers. He is slow off the line and isnt athletic in the least.. I dont really mind the rest of the picks, but im not overly happy with them either.  Snisher has shown that over 5 years they cant build a line or draft skill position players. Gurley will be fine (not really talking about him) but is he really going to be so much better than Mason that it was worth taking him over a potential number one wr or the best line prospect? Im not sure.  Now our book end tackles are two guys where pass blocking isnt their forte and we have another qb that has had a couple injuries throwing to wrs who arent known to get much separation. This smells like a disaster to me."
StLouisRams,34r1js,Kuro007,4,Sun May 3 21:23:42 2015 UTC,"We didn't take Peat because he is a pass blocker more than a run blocker. Tre Mason as a backup might see similar amount of touches to a lot of starting backs. Fisher wants to ground and pound, and part of that is having two good backs that we can switch out at will to keep them fresh. I do agree,  'stein might not adjust well to the NFL, but I feel like Donnall and Brown can. I'm not getting my hopes up, but if even two of these lineman pan out and Gurley lives up to his potential, we are in a great place, especially considering our entire defense is back plus more."
StLouisRams,34r1js,One_Half_Hamster,3,Mon May 4 01:05:06 2015 UTC,"This is a great point that a lot of people miss. When you're a run dominant team, you don't want one guy taking all of the load. The RB position is brutal and Gurley would get pretty banged up doing it alone. Also, the Rams could experiment with a dual RB backfield."
StLouisRams,34r1js,impossiber,1 point,Mon May 4 09:31:46 2015 UTC,So you think Peat is more of a pass blocker than a run blocker? Wouldnt it make sense to have at least one good passblocking tackle out there for a quarterback that has had multiple injuries and isnt exactly mobile? Protecting someone who can be our QBOTF should be our number one priority.
StLouisRams,34r1js,Kuro007,1 point,Tue May 5 02:24:35 2015 UTC,Just because they are better run blockers doesn't make them bad pass blockers.  Honestly if we even get two decent blockers from this draft class I expect that our pass protection will be much better than last year as well.

I expect our 2nd round pick to be really, really bad. So bad in pass pro that his run blocking wont make up for it. I hope I'm wrong, because its nothing more that can be done but accept whats happened."
StLouisRams,34r1js,Kuro007,1 point,Wed May 6 20:34:41 2015 UTC,"Havenstein you mean? Ya I am the least excited about him to be honest. That being said, Fisher and Snead did a lot more and a lot better scouting than either of us so I will reserve my judgement. If I were to venture a guess though, Brown and Donnal will be the two most likely players to be good starters of our rookie lineman."

StLouisRams,34nwjn,pyanes93,7,Sat May 2 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"A year ago he was our entrenched starter, with Mason just a blip on the radar. Amazing that he fell so far so fast without really doing anything wrong.         Hope he does well and smashes the Patriots in the face a few times."

StLouisRams,34oo6p,thisbeareatsbacon,17,Sun May 3 05:11:59 2015 UTC,"They put the Browns as losers when they made some of the best picks and seem to be consensus winners, so take this list with a grain of salt."

We won't even have the first clue until training camp. Post-draft rankings are invariably meaningless.        Still, it feels good to have something to be optimistic about."
StLouisRams,34oo6p,Tre2,3,Sun May 3 03:52:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, we will be able to name draft winners in probably 5 years, and make a really fair judgement in 8-15"
StLouisRams,34oo6p,SonsOfAnarchyMC,2,Sun May 3 04:47:52 2015 UTC,Honestly just saw a report that names us as one of the losers of the draft.  I prefer to think otherwise.  They claim Gurley is risky and coming off major knee surgery could put him into a first year slump.  I'm sure this is possible but I think the upside is greater and fits in with Jeff Fischer's offense really well.   It won't be the greatest show on turf but we can ground and pound some victories out with our defense keeping the score down.
StLouisRams,34oo6p,bretris,0,Sun May 3 13:22:27 2015 UTC,Gurley won't start until week 5 probably so unlikely that he's going to have earth shattering numbers his first year.

StLouisRams,34nroy,JackD440,7,Sat May 2 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's gotta be easier to compete with Ivory, Ridley, and Powell than with Mason (who unseated him last year), Cunningham (who is more well rounded than Stacy, if not as much of a feature), and the guy we just used the #10 pick on, Gurley."
StLouisRams,34nroy,CplPJ,3,Sat May 2 23:54:55 2015 UTC,Definitely doesn't seem like an improvement.

StLouisRams,34nroy,richhomieram,7,Sat May 2 22:58:00 2015 UTC,"Any word on how good he is? I know he wasn't thrilled with Gurley being drafted. But honestly, I don't see much more room for him here. Is he good on the pass game? Because that's his best bet at making the roster right now."
StLouisRams,34nroy,viewless25,16,Sat May 2 21:33:49 2015 UTC,He's at least as good as everyone you have right now.
StLouisRams,34nroy,bwc_28,5,Sat May 2 21:35:54 2015 UTC,"I think Ivory is a better runner than Stacy, but Stacy has more ability in the passing game than Ridley or Ivory."
StLouisRams,34nroy,frankoftank,3,Sat May 2 22:37:07 2015 UTC,I think Stacy is just as capable of a runner. But it's definitely debatable so I'm not really disagreeing with you.
StLouisRams,34nroy,bwc_28,1 point,Sat May 2 22:45:03 2015 UTC,"It depends on which Zac Stacy you're looking at. Stacy looked as good or better than Ivory in 2013, but Stacy wasn't the same guy last year. Hopefully he can return to form for the Jets and beat Brady once or twice this year."
StLouisRams,34nroy,frankoftank,1 point,Sat May 2 22:50:05 2015 UTC,"I hope he runs like he did his rookie year, against the Pats at the very least."
StLouisRams,34nroy,bwc_28,-1,Sat May 2 22:52:15 2015 UTC,"Stacy is garbage in the passing game and that's a major part of why he's not on the team any more. Fisher likes complete backs. Running is just part of their job. They need to catch, pass block, run down field. Stacy has great vision, behind a decent O line he will succeed. But no need to talk him up. He has a career 3.9 YPC. That isn't very good."
StLouisRams,34nroy,helpimnaked,1 point,Sat May 2 23:31:03 2015 UTC,"Stacy was not garbage in the passing game. He just wasn't as good as Cunningham, and wasn't as good a runner as Tre, so he had no role to play for us."
StLouisRams,34nroy,frankoftank,2,Sun May 3 04:14:42 2015 UTC,"He's not as good a runner as Ivory, but he's probably at least as good as Ridley and is a better pass catcher than Ivory or Ridley."
StLouisRams,34nroy,frankoftank,1 point,Sat May 2 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"I think he is average starter quality. Compact build, good strength and power, good vision and mental acumen, quick feet. He is basically a RB that lacks top end speed, but is average-to above average at everything else.  Fell behind Benny because Benny is faster and better in the passing game. Stacy also deals with nagging injuries alot. Stacy is a good player though, don't believe everyone here telling you he is bad."

StLouisRams,34nroy,bwc_28,18,Sat May 2 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"There was no guarantee that Gurley would be at 10. I get what you're saying, but it's also easy to say in hindsight."
StLouisRams,34nroy,Noobguy27,7,Sat May 2 21:30:04 2015 UTC,"We all knew our backfield was going to be Mason and Cunningham even before we drafted Gurley. Stacy was the odd man out. Waiting until it was obvious to absolutely everyone in the league that he was going to be released or traded made him lose all value. It's not hindsight, it's something that's been said for a while (that he needed to be traded)."
StLouisRams,34nroy,bwc_28,2,Sat May 2 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"It was obvious well before the end of the regular season. Stacy had 10 carries in the last 6 weeks and hadn't had over 10 carries in a single game since week 4, he was done in St. Louis by that point. He was getting less use than Cunningham before midway through the season. He had no value well before we drafted Gurley."

StLouisRams,34nroy,haamm,6,Sun May 3 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"No it's not. Stacy had no value. He is not that good and there were plenty of RBs in the draft. What team would give a 5th for him if they could just draft a fresh, better player?"
StLouisRams,34nroy,diesel321,-5,Sat May 2 21:47:51 2015 UTC,"Right, Stacy isn't that good. Ok..."
StLouisRams,34nroy,bwc_28,6,Sat May 2 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"He was a hard runner but was just a product of volume. RBs like him are a dime a dozen. I'm sure Snead tried to shop him but fact is his market value is just a 7th or so. He hardly played last year  And btw, dealing Stacy pre-draft is not smart. Shopping Stacy around plays your hand that you plan to take Gurley. Maybe a team trades up with the Giants at 9 and nabs him from us and we're out of Stacy and our desired RB"
StLouisRams,34nroy,diesel321,-10,Sat May 2 21:55:03 2015 UTC,"RBs like him are a dime a dozen.   Haha ok, sure buddy."
StLouisRams,34nroy,bwc_28,9,Sat May 2 21:56:10 2015 UTC,"Ok no point in talking to you. You're just a delusional fan and ""argue"" like a child. Stacy couldn't even beat out Watts or Cunningham dude  Fact and reality is he has no value and a 7th is good return for him. What do you think he is worth? A 5th? Lmao you could just draft a better RB. Snead and Fisher played this draft wonderfully, nothing to be upset about. Trading him early tips your hand and probably doesn't get you more value. The other option was cutting him and just having no picks instead of a 7th"
StLouisRams,34nroy,diesel321,3,Sat May 2 22:01:22 2015 UTC,"Diesel is right. He hit holes hard and had good balance but lacked exceptional power, speed, or vision. He was on the better side of average (he certainly wasn't a bad running back), but he was clearly less talented than mason as a leading rusher and he was worse than Cunningham in pass protection. He was simply the odd man out on our team and while he would have been a slight improvement over many teams rbs his talent wasnt that much higher than the rbs on most teams rosters. I think we could have shopped a 6th but that's about his worth in a league of very talented rbs."
StLouisRams,34nroy,usernameistaken5,3,Sat May 2 22:09:44 2015 UTC,"/u/diesel321 is right. Stacy is a great situation back, but a 5th or 6th rounder can be used on a back that hasn't had the injuries that he's had.   I'd rather trade him and get the 7th than show our hand early.   Lastly, you complain about the downvote brigade that follows you around this subreddit. I'm convinced that if you'd just lose the snarky remarks, your opinions wouldn't be downvoted so heavily."
StLouisRams,34nroy,BeefyMcFlaps,-4,Sat May 2 22:02:56 2015 UTC,"I got downvoted simply for asking for a link in another thread when someone said Stacy had been traded.

Anyone who makes a comment that's below 50% consensus in this subreddit will be downvoted into negatives.        I disagree with you about Stacy, but threw you a few upvotes to restore the balance. (But not the ""ok sure buddy"" comment, because that doesn't add much to the discussion.)"
StLouisRams,34nroy,txyesboy,-1,Sun May 3 03:04:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand how ""trades"" work. His ""value"" to OTHER teams doesn't change one bit because STL drafted Gurley. Him dropping a spot on the depth chart here has zero effect on his value to someone else. And, as said before - if he REALLY had such value BEFORE the draft to warrant getting a 5th for him, they would've done that in a heartbeat. But if you're certain STL would've gotten a 5th (or even better) for Stacy; you're obviously more well connected in the behind the scenes maneuvers of this team than I am."
StLouisRams,34nroy,ramSACKcity,2,Sat May 2 23:18:50 2015 UTC,How were we going to get a 5th round pick for him after the year he had last year?

StLouisRams,34ozn1,ClitorisNigga,9,Sun May 3 05:37:51 2015 UTC,Sounds great in theory but he's never been healthy.
StLouisRams,34ozn1,lakerfan91,5,Sun May 3 05:41:43 2015 UTC,"Ok I am a huge LSU fan so I had to spend four years watching that man play. Point blank, for all the comments about his ability he us one of the best OL prospects I have ever seen. He can recognize blitz and pressure better than anyone I can remember. He is excellent at calling adjustments and was a great leader for the Alabama OL. He chose to play hurt in his last National Championship game and that set him back in the NFL and then he suffered an unfortunate injury, but the potential is still there. Bottom line having seen him play I am very excited to see him get a chance."
StLouisRams,34ozn1,Darknight622,1 point,Sun May 3 13:21:31 2015 UTC,"What were his injuries? Never got good details on that, do you know what was up?"
StLouisRams,34ozn1,Zoloir,1 point,Fri May 8 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"He had an injury to his foot in college that only ended up holding him out of his rookie season because he played on it instead of getting it fixed. Then he had a back injury at the start of last season, but he ended playing in the last five games of the season, at least I think it was five may have been more."
StLouisRams,34ozn1,Darknight622,3,Fri May 8 13:23:14 2015 UTC,My thinking is that he can't be worse than Scott Wells.
StLouisRams,34ozn1,Jumanji-,2,Sun May 3 12:39:01 2015 UTC,"If you put me at center I would be worse than Scott Wells, so therefore it is possible someone could be worse than Scott Wells.  However for an NFL caliber lineman the chances are more remote."
StLouisRams,34ozn1,LLv2,3,Sun May 3 20:11:50 2015 UTC,Barrett Jones is a monster of a center with a mean streak in run blocking.
StLouisRams,34ozn1,TacoxOFxBell,3,Sun May 3 16:43:15 2015 UTC,"It seems like there is a reason he's still in the roster, likely being that the coaches have confidence in his ability when healthy. Not drafting a center underlines this theory, to me."
StLouisRams,34ozn1,ChalupaLoompa,2,Sun May 3 18:52:14 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with that. He basically had 2 years to get healthy, and now the Rams are going to let him loose."
StLouisRams,34ozn1,TacoxOFxBell,2,Sun May 3 19:16:13 2015 UTC,"Amen to that. The O-Line's being built up in all other needs places except Center really backs up your idea. If he can deliver on what he's been sold as before, then we're due for some good performance going forward."
StLouisRams,34ozn1,SoulardSTL,3,Mon May 4 18:06:37 2015 UTC,"I'd be find with it, if I could see some concrete evidence that he actually exists."

StLouisRams,34nte3,TGMurray,10,Sat May 2 21:38:10 2015 UTC,Look at his pro-day stats. He's a hyper-athlete. Really like this pick. If Laurinaitis can bring his game intelligence up we've got ourselves a high potential pick here.

StLouisRams,34myoy,BrawndoTTM,10,Sat May 2 17:07:35 2015 UTC,"Reading his draft profile, it's very clear what mold Fisher is going for. He has all the same strengths and weaknesses as the other two OL guys we took. He's 6'6"", 313 pounds so just like the other two, he's huge even by NFL OT standards. Just like the other two, he's somewhat limited in speed, strength and athleticism, but (again, just like the other two) scouts say he compensates for that with sound technical skill, high intelligence and a good work ethic. I'm not sure how it's going to work out, but the plan is clear."

StLouisRams,34myoy,BrawndoTTM,8,Sat May 2 17:10:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, not very impressive for a man that big, but keep in mind that he has really long arms, which makes bench press difficult. He's still way stronger than 5'10"" CBs with the same or better numbers on BP."

StLouisRams,34myoy,BeefyMcFlaps,11,Sun May 3 04:07:06 2015 UTC,We need line depth way worse than we need receivers or corners. We actually have proven bodies for those areas.
StLouisRams,34myoy,ptabs226,4,Sat May 2 17:12:24 2015 UTC,"I like our CB's and wr's. Which corner do would you replace; Jenkins, Gaines, Tru, or Joyner? Also our WR's aren't bad. Quick, Britt, Bailey, Austin, and Givens. I don't think many teams keep more then 4 cb's and 5/6 wr's.  I don't think anyone in the 4th rounder would replace any of our wr's or CB's."
StLouisRams,34myoy,pyanes93,7,Sat May 2 17:20:44 2015 UTC,Ya I'm wrong I wasn't thinking about the WR we already have.
StLouisRams,34myoy,RamsWillFly,3,Sat May 2 17:40:39 2015 UTC,"A-lot of great players come out of the 4th-6th rounds, on the top of my head I can think that Kam Chancellor was Drafted in the 5th, Sherman was drafted in the 5th, Antonio Brown was taken in the 6th. He was a top 5 receiver last season.  i'm not hating on the OT picks but if the best player on the board in Fishers mind was a Receiver or CB, it might be worth taking the chance. I personally think our Receivers are highly underrated and will do just fine this year but it wouldn't hurt to take a DB in the 6th."
StLouisRams,34myoy,jts81,3,Sat May 2 17:46:39 2015 UTC,"Yes it happens OCCASIONALLY, but that's the exception, not the rule. That being said, EJ Gaines was a sixth round pick..."

StLouisRams,34myoy,Shonuff88,2,Sat May 2 18:13:25 2015 UTC,25th and 39th pick in the 6th round
StLouisRams,34nn1h,kahyote484,4,Sat May 2 20:38:46 2015 UTC,I'm seeing a lot of good but the dude throws without setting his feet a lot. Also he tends to overthrow a bit. Overall looks good though when he sets his feet. That's all I can get from one game without seeing more though.
StLouisRams,34nn1h,tzechmann2,3,Sat May 2 21:56:03 2015 UTC,I think it's one of those things where he has the attitude and work ethic of a winner and Snish think they can mold him into a NFL caliber QB.
StLouisRams,34nn1h,BeefyMcFlaps,1 point,Sat May 2 22:17:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I was just stating what I saw with him. All those things that I mentioned are workable. The one worry I didn't state was his decision making as the game wore on but you can't really tell that in one game."
StLouisRams,34nn1h,tzechmann2,4,Sat May 2 22:36:08 2015 UTC,"That is one of the major cons listed in his scouting report. He has an arm, but he doesn't have good feet placement for his throws,  is slow as molasses so he can't scramble, and makes a lot of wobbly throws which means he is gonna be a turnover machine and backup quality at best."
StLouisRams,34nn1h,Musingmike,1 point,Sat May 2 22:37:00 2015 UTC,"Hey I'm on point then! Anyway if the guy learns to set his feet he won't throw as many of those wobbly ducks and two of those three cons are gone. Hopefully our line from this draft pans out and we can negate that last issue as well. Not really holding my breath for him to be starter-caliber anytime soon though (if ever), but again that's just what I've seen from this one game and people surprise you."
StLouisRams,34nn1h,tzechmann2,-2,Sat May 2 22:43:14 2015 UTC,"He wasn't drafted with the intention of becoming a future starter. That much I'm sure of. If he does somehow, then that's nice. But they needed and wanted a solid backup. Seems like they're putting all their eggs in the Nick Foles basket."
StLouisRams,34nn1h,rloftis6,4,Sun May 3 01:05:24 2015 UTC,"there are a lot of inaccurate passes in the first half of that video (that's how far i am currently). this is the only film i've seen of mannion and from this i can only say he's a slight improvement over hill.   i have to go, but ill watch the rest of this tonight and continue my thoughts then."

StLouisRams,34miud,Shonuff88,7,Sat May 2 14:36:28 2015 UTC,"I personally really like Ifo Ekpre Olomu. I remember last draft there were some who thought he was a mid-first round talent, so I think he would be a steal. Although the knock on him is we have a similar guy in Lamarcus Joyner.   I also love Justin Hardy. His production is insane and its not because he relies on athleticism. He's not the biggest,strongest or fastest receiver, yet he is still one of the most productive College receivers ever.  Shaq Mason also is a target I like at Center, although he played guard at college. He's undersized at 6'1"" but he uses his leverage to his advantage. Really a good option, have a look at the tape."
StLouisRams,34miud,TGMurray,2,Sat May 2 15:29:45 2015 UTC,"Gotta go Ekpre-Olomu if he's there. I completely forgot about him until I saw him on that list because in reality he should have been picked already. There's a very good chance he ends up being the best DB in this draft class. Guaranteed first rounder last year, and probably this year before he tore his ACL"
StLouisRams,34miud,ndaly87,1 point,Sat May 2 16:21:13 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, but with Janoris Jenkins and Johnson going into contract years, if we pick a CB, I would prefer it a guy taller than Ekpre-Olomu. Because if both JJ and TJ leave, then our tallest starter will be Gaines at 5'10."
StLouisRams,34miud,TGMurray,1 point,Sat May 2 16:37:09 2015 UTC,"Granted I'm new to the Rams, I feel like chances are both of those guys don't leave. Already have Joyner, right? I know he's small too but he's one hell of a talent and is only going to get better. If one of those guys leaves, then either Joyner or Ekpre-Olomu step in on the wings and will still do just as well, if not better."

StLouisRams,34miud,daedalus000,2,Sat May 2 16:07:47 2015 UTC,Gonna guess Ramik Wilson in the 4th.
StLouisRams,34miud,bozo7337,2,Sat May 2 15:22:28 2015 UTC,One Jake Ryan please. We need depth at LB and a guy who can eventually replace JL55.

StLouisRams,34miud,gabers24,1 point,Sat May 2 15:26:39 2015 UTC,I'd like Kwon Alexander- LB depth and good special teamer.
StLouisRams,34miud,Vantom12,1 point,Sat May 2 16:58:10 2015 UTC,Kwon Alexander! This guy is the real deal and it may not be the biggest position of need but he can play
StLouisRams,34n6eg,Wm_TheConqueror,14,Sat May 2 18:10:55 2015 UTC,"I personally think Joyner, he was a beast in the pre season, but ended up getting injured. I think his injury was nagging him, so he wasn't able to play to his full potential. He also was a 2nd round pick after all."
StLouisRams,34n6eg,ItsBiggy,2,Sat May 2 18:12:15 2015 UTC,He was all over the field for us! Can't wait to see him live up to his potential
StLouisRams,34n6eg,ickypicky,1 point,Sat May 2 20:21:49 2015 UTC,Love that little dude. Hits like a semi.  Hope he stays healthy this season.
StLouisRams,34n6eg,mananiux,9,Sat May 2 23:17:58 2015 UTC,Is it silly to hope that Brian Quick will be the biggest beneficiary from a power run game?
StLouisRams,34n6eg,ImTheBestMayne,2,Sat May 2 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"No I agree, I have high hopes for Quick, especially since he seemed ready to make the leap right before he got hurt"
StLouisRams,34n6eg,vrock627,1 point,Sat May 2 20:00:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not, I think our whole receiving corps will benefit from a very run-oriented offense. Will definitely open up the field for them."
StLouisRams,34n6eg,porkfish66,9,Sat May 2 19:19:17 2015 UTC,"If he is finally healthy, Barrett Jones."

StLouisRams,34n6eg,pattycraq,5,Sun May 3 03:29:06 2015 UTC,It's time for him to shit or get off the pot.
StLouisRams,34n6eg,thebluick,2,Sat May 2 19:37:19 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't mind him taking up that vacant Center spot. He was a beast in college, now to wait and see if he actually exists."
StLouisRams,34n6eg,8q5,7,Sat May 2 19:20:07 2015 UTC,"1) Going to cosign /u/Wm_TheConqueror with Joyner.   2) Second pick is Steddy B. He puts in a lot of work and seems really dedicated to honing his craft, plus he probably has the best hands and route running ability among all of our receivers. I can see him having a great year next season.  3) I'll probably get a lot of flack for this pick, but I have a crazy feeling deep, deep, deep down in the lowest depths of my mind that Jared Cook is finally going to have a great season and earn all the money we're throwing at him."
StLouisRams,34n6eg,RamsWillFly,2,Sat May 2 18:32:37 2015 UTC,Consistent play from the QB and RB's should really help with 2 and 3.
StLouisRams,34n6eg,kersey79,1 point,Sat May 2 18:37:26 2015 UTC,"I'm really high on Stedman too, totally forgot about him. Has great hands, and good routes as well. I think being out in the beginning of the season kind of slowed his development, but I think he will be good this year."
StLouisRams,34n6eg,Daytwa313,3,Sat May 2 18:44:34 2015 UTC,"Brian Quick?  probably not a surprise, but if he stays healthy for a full season, he'll be a beast of a WR."
StLouisRams,34mir3,Shonuff88,19,Sat May 2 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"This years draft has officially become the "" Meat & Potatoes "" draft"
StLouisRams,34mir3,inandoutagain,8,Sat May 2 17:06:46 2015 UTC,Last year was Sack City. This year we are Beef City
StLouisRams,34mir3,I_am_THE_GRAPIST,5,Sun May 3 00:33:55 2015 UTC,Both sounding slightly gay.
StLouisRams,34mir3,DapperDan33,7,Sun May 3 07:02:31 2015 UTC,I like adding o line depth for sure. Notice Fish hasn't bitten on a defensive player yet but after the Gurley pick I'm glad they actually were committed to fixing our line
StLouisRams,34mir3,DapperDan33,3,Sat May 2 17:12:10 2015 UTC,More meat
StLouisRams,34mir3,hb_alien,-5,Sat May 2 21:03:55 2015 UTC,With Mannion being the potato?  I still don't get that pick.  Edit:  Seriously people.  What's the upside here?  We spent a 3rd round pick on a future backup QB when there was tons of talent left on the board.
StLouisRams,34mir3,CplPJ,4,Sat May 2 17:11:21 2015 UTC,"Never know what a player can become. Upside is that he is coachable in his mistakes, and can be a solid starting QB."
StLouisRams,34mir3,bleedblue89,13,Sun May 3 00:13:41 2015 UTC,"MORE OLINE!!!! I Like it a lot, someone has to be good right?"
StLouisRams,34mir3,valt10,8,Sat May 2 17:02:11 2015 UTC,What do you guys think?  I'm feeling positive about their draft strategy and results so far.  We finally addressed the OL by specifically nabbing a couple of run-maulers.  Throw in Sean Mannion + a fresh-at-all-times Gurley/Mason/Cunningham trio and I'm impressed.  Now get Barksdale back!
StLouisRams,34mir3,TacoxOFxBell,1 point,Sat May 2 14:37:20 2015 UTC,"I was skeptical of the Gurley pick at first, but I think as a whole I'm really happy with our draft. Mix of risky picks with a lot of potential and picks that addressed our needs."
StLouisRams,34mir3,ChalupaLoompa,1 point,Sat May 2 20:03:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like signing Barksdale is really a non issue. They drafted 6'7"" 300+ pounds of RT and got a RG. We are set on the right side."
StLouisRams,34mir3,TacoxOFxBell,11,Sat May 2 14:44:41 2015 UTC,"It is definitely less of an issue, but Barksdale is proven quality on that side, and I think we need his presence there before/during the rookies' acclimation to starting on our line.  They're huge, but they're rookies."
StLouisRams,34mir3,ChalupaLoompa,8,Sat May 2 14:50:47 2015 UTC,"Resigning Barksdale will mean we might actually have depth at OL, which is kinda nuts considering. I was disappointed that the top two Centers were picked before we got one. C seems to me to be our most pressing need now, then more talent/depth at LB and CB."
StLouisRams,34mir3,yohansmash,3,Sat May 2 15:15:19 2015 UTC,"We could really use a center, since Barrett Jones simply does not exist.  I think he was a figment of all our imaginations"
StLouisRams,34mir3,hb_alien,7,Sat May 2 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"I think Barrett Jones is ready. He maybe a mythical beast, but he is still a beast. He's ready."
StLouisRams,34mir3,hb_alien,1 point,Sat May 2 16:03:03 2015 UTC,Haha I hope so.  Loved the guy at Bama
StLouisRams,34mir3,Shonuff88,3,Sat May 2 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"His college film is awesome. Every time Snead or Fisher say they're solid on OL, it makes me wonder if they have more confidence in Jones than they let on. I sure hope that's the case."
StLouisRams,34mir3,thebluick,2,Sat May 2 16:32:12 2015 UTC,I think if he is healthy he should good to go for us. I mean he has essentially 2 years to learn the playbook so he should know exactly what he is doing on the field.
StLouisRams,34mir3,bwc_28,1 point,Sat May 2 17:46:22 2015 UTC,I hear that particular RT sucks in pass protection.
StLouisRams,34mir3,CplPJ,2,Sat May 2 15:53:32 2015 UTC,I think it's a funny coincidence how we have Foles (Mr. 27/2 from 2013) commanding our predominantly run-oriented offense.  So maybe that RT's poor pass blocking can be hidden in our scheme
StLouisRams,34mir3,bwc_28,0,Sat May 2 16:02:18 2015 UTC,I don't know man.  I get uneasy when Fisher drafts offense.
StLouisRams,34mir3,thebluick,7,Sat May 2 16:15:05 2015 UTC,"Some Rams fans make me laugh, they wanted the Rams to address o-line in the draft and do and they're STILL not happy, It's going to take time to build up this O-line because idk if you notice but our o-line has been horrible. So if we have to draft a bunch of OL and build them up so be it."
StLouisRams,34mir3,DapperDan33,1 point,Sat May 2 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"I'm less mad at the draft then when we picked a RB in the first round.  I'm glad we picked so many O-Linemen.    I still feel like we are going to be weak at Safety and CB though.  I have no idea how any of these players will be, but on paper it looks like a B- / C+ draft."
StLouisRams,34mir3,DapperDan33,0,Sat May 2 21:33:03 2015 UTC,Our weakest position at this point is center and corner. Our secondary is going to get completely exposed next season.
StLouisRams,34mir3,TB_Punters,3,Sat May 2 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"Is it going to get exposed? Our secondary was dramatically improved last year. McDonald was very good, McLeod proved he isn't just a liability, and Gaines showed he can be a new starter on D.  Unless you're expecting TJ and EJ to regress and expecting McLeod, TruJo, JJenks, and Joyner to have no improvement, I'm cautiously optimistic about our secondary."
StLouisRams,34mir3,CplPJ,1 point,Sun May 3 00:17:55 2015 UTC,I'm expecting Tru and Jenkins to be their usual inconsistent selves. Unless McDonald and McLeod step up in a big way to cover their mistakes I don't see us being able to cover decent receiving corps very well.
StLouisRams,34mir3,TB_Punters,1 point,Sun May 3 00:58:47 2015 UTC,"Center... yeah, I guess we are hoping Tim Barnes or Barret Jones turn out ok.  Forgot about center since we grabbed 4 O-Linemen."

StLouisRams,34mir3,Myndspyke,3,Sat May 2 20:26:40 2015 UTC,I like the Missouri pick!
StLouisRams,34mir3,JKaye57,2,Sat May 2 20:27:36 2015 UTC,Same round we picked up EJ Gaines last year
StLouisRams,34mir3,Shonuff88,2,Sat May 2 20:34:55 2015 UTC,"Gaines was a DROY darkhorse candidate last year, maybe Sasser will be a OROY candidate this year!"
StLouisRams,34mir3,DapperDan33,4,Sat May 2 23:01:13 2015 UTC,Not with Gurley around ;)

StLouisRams,34mir3,jts81,4,Sun May 3 05:15:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know who Bud Sasser is, but he has an amazing name so I like him already."
StLouisRams,34mir3,DapperDan33,4,Sat May 2 20:32:18 2015 UTC,Another tackle building that depth on the OL
StLouisRams,34mir3,DapperDan33,5,Sat May 2 17:01:54 2015 UTC,Another giant. I think Fish finally realizes that we really need offense after building up the defense for so long.
StLouisRams,34mir3,thebluick,5,Sat May 2 17:03:05 2015 UTC,Any Missouri fans like to fill me in on the WR we just drafted?
StLouisRams,34mir3,Darknight622,4,Sat May 2 20:30:00 2015 UTC,He took over for DGB after he got kicked off the team. Great hands and only player in the SEC to have more receptions last year was Amari Cooper
StLouisRams,34mir3,thebluick,4,Sat May 2 21:12:40 2015 UTC,Bud Sasser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYu8a73lOj0
StLouisRams,34mir3,Darknight622,4,Sat May 2 20:37:44 2015 UTC,I liked his ability to concentrate on those jump balls with a defender in his face!
StLouisRams,34mir3,DapperDan33,4,Sat May 2 20:42:09 2015 UTC,Just traded Stacy to the Jets for another 7th round pick
StLouisRams,34mir3,bwc_28,3,Sat May 2 21:20:52 2015 UTC,Bryce Hager ILB Baylor https://youtu.be/ZTONmR6A9yo
StLouisRams,34mir3,DapperDan33,2,Sat May 2 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"and after picking a DE, they basically gave the Jets Stacy.  I'll be surprised if this player makes the team...  Weird pick..."
StLouisRams,34mir3,TweetsInCommentsBot,6,Sat May 2 21:30:06 2015 UTC,They used the Jets pick to draft a linebacker. Their last pick was a DE.
StLouisRams,34mir3,Shonuff88,1 point,Sat May 2 21:33:30 2015 UTC,really?  I guess I just read it wrong on the tv.
StLouisRams,34mir3,bozo7337,3,Sat May 2 21:34:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah Hager is listed as an inside linebacker. They picked up Martin Ifedi with their last pick who is a DE. The feed on TV is like three picks behind, the draft tracker on espn.com is way more up to date."
StLouisRams,34mir3,bozo7337,4,Sat May 2 21:39:08 2015 UTC,Seemed like Stacy fell behind Tre And Cunningham anyways. While I thought he was worth more than a 7th round pick I like the Hager pick a lot and Fish and Snead can never have enough DEs

StLouisRams,34mir3,pmm2428,3,Sat May 2 15:58:10 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind it  but if they see him as too similar to Joyner I think they will pass
StLouisRams,34mir3,Shonuff88,2,Sat May 2 16:02:26 2015 UTC,If we get him this late and he recovers from his knee it would be a massive value pick
StLouisRams,34mir3,KurtanionNZ,3,Sat May 2 20:07:16 2015 UTC,I agree I would like him on this team I just hope the Rams want him too you know.
StLouisRams,34mir3,DapperDan33,2,Sat May 2 20:10:03 2015 UTC,Guessing the team doctors didn't like what they saw

StLouisRams,34mir3,hb_alien,5,Sat May 2 19:11:45 2015 UTC,What WR left n the board is worth trading up for?

StLouisRams,34mir3,bwc_28,2,Sat May 2 20:35:44 2015 UTC,I hope we dish out some UDFA dollars for a center like Finney. Not comfortable with the ghost of Barrett Jones manning the middle

StLouisRams,34nj48,larrylightz,4,Sat May 2 20:03:14 2015 UTC,Ifo might be worth a flyer if he's still there. I woulnd't mind gambling on La'el Collins either now that we know he can't re-enter the draft and pretty much has no choice but to sign if he wants to play pro ball at all.
StLouisRams,34nj48,BrawndoTTM,3,Sat May 2 20:07:08 2015 UTC,He can re-enter the draft if he's picked. That's been well established. He cannot however re-enter the draft if he goes undrafted.
StLouisRams,34nj48,bwc_28,2,Sat May 2 20:20:18 2015 UTC,"I'd take the gamble on Collins in the 7th. If everything works out with him, he could be a major steal."

StLouisRams,34l4td,paperllamasunited,6,Sat May 2 02:58:14 2015 UTC,"Quick question, did he play in a pro-style offense?"
StLouisRams,34l4td,ramSACKcity,7,Sat May 2 05:53:33 2015 UTC,"From NFL.com   A four-year starter at Oregon State, Mannion guided a pro-style offense, totaling 13,600 yards through the air for his college career. After throwing 37 touchdowns as a junior, he had just 15 in 2014."
StLouisRams,34l4td,paperllamasunited,1 point,Sat May 2 06:05:34 2015 UTC,"Very much so. I've watched him play the last four years and our offense prepares players for the NFL because of its pro style.

StLouisRams,34l4td,mewfahsah,2,Sat May 2 20:17:27 2015 UTC,Hopefully Foles can be a serviceable starter for a few years while we develop this guy and see if he has what it takes.

StLouisRams,34l4td,sjphilsphan,0,Sat May 2 03:00:12 2015 UTC,Geno Smith was a recent guy drafted early who was strictly a deep ball thrower and look how he's doing. I think the pick could be a lot smarter than a lot of people think.

StLouisRams,34l4td,D33GS,7,Sat May 2 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"I think it was a good pick, and with Foles we can develop him, and he might even be a solid backup at this time. After Bradford went down we were stuck with Shaun Hill, who isn't horrible, but nothing special. I think having Foles and a young guy makes more sense to me."
StLouisRams,34l4td,jtb3566,6,Sat May 2 03:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yea I like the pick too.  It makes the whole Case Kennum trade look a little weird though.

Very weird logic in retrospect the way this played out."

StLouisRams,34l4td,mlasn,5,Sat May 2 03:06:11 2015 UTC,"Yup; he has good size, intelligence, decent arm, and has played in a pro-style offense. I think he'll be a good backup at the very least."
StLouisRams,34l4td,Vantom12,5,Sat May 2 03:21:34 2015 UTC,"I thought it would be this or Hundley if we went QB, wasn't a huge Petty fan."
StLouisRams,34l4td,mcthsn,4,Sat May 2 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"Like this pick a lot. He's a four year starter with plenty experience; he could step in next year to compete or sooner if Foles gets injured. Smart guy with good work ethic and was the third QB on our board according to Mortenson. With our run game and defense, he is the kind of guy I want."
StLouisRams,34l4td,DeniseDeNephew,2,Sat May 2 03:09:07 2015 UTC,"Yep. He's a game manager, and that's what the Rams need."

StLouisRams,34l4td,Moose321,2,Sat May 2 02:56:44 2015 UTC,I'm excited to see what Weinke can do with Mannion.   Fairley was a great off-season acquisition but Weinke may end up being the best addition in years.
StLouisRams,34l4td,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,2,Sat May 2 02:58:20 2015 UTC,Draft Profile
StLouisRams,34l4td,bwc_28,2,Sat May 2 03:08:25 2015 UTC,Most passing yards in Pac 12 history.
StLouisRams,34l4td,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,4,Sat May 2 05:38:42 2015 UTC,This is who they linked to the rams the whole time. Great pick and other than Winston he is the only other possible day one starter in this draft. I am loving all of these picks. perfect draft for us. Havenstein is Jeremiah's most under the radar tackle too.
StLouisRams,34l4td,mehster432,4,Sat May 2 02:58:41 2015 UTC,He is in no way a day one starter. He gets flustered under the slightest pocket pressure (even imagined pressure) and lets his throws sail and get away from him. He needs to develop decent pocket presence before he can start at the NFL level. If he doesn't develop that he'll be adding to his 50+ college interceptions very quickly.  Edit: very very few scouts think Mannion is a day one starter. And I challenge anyone here to post a link to a reputable analyst who says he is one.
StLouisRams,34l4td,bwc_28,-3,Sat May 2 03:29:20 2015 UTC,I said possible starter. Every other qb in this draft is absolutely not a starter. I heard/saw it on a podcast or nfln.
StLouisRams,34l4td,Seductive_Santa,1 point,Sat May 2 04:26:02 2015 UTC,"Oregon State fan here.  Mannion is a perfectly serviceable Pro-Style QB who can make all the NFL throws you want, but not consistently. He's not nearly as accurate as his numbers say he is. Unless he really improves his accuracy and anticipation beyond slants and checkdowns, he won't be anything more than a game manager type QB who's prone to 4 INT games when he's asked to be more than that."
StLouisRams,34l4td,Ethanhekker,0,Sat May 2 18:22:07 2015 UTC,"And I will repeat that he is in no way a day one starter. He had more than 80 combined interceptions and fumbles throughout his college career. Most of that was solely on him. He panics under pressure and holds the ball low and loose, and cannot throw on the run. These are issues that can be addressed (mostly), but they are not characteristics of a day one starter on a team with a big fat question mark at offensive line."
StLouisRams,34l4td,TweetPoster,2,Sat May 2 04:29:46 2015 UTC,"Wanted Hundley, but everything I've heard says this guy can play, so good pick."

StLouisRams,34l4td,dropdgmz,4,Sat May 2 02:54:11 2015 UTC,I figure we'd get rid of Davis since we just traded a pick for Keenum
StLouisRams,34l4td,fmissle,-1,Sat May 2 03:02:43 2015 UTC,"There's just as good a chance that we cut Mannion as Keenum or Davis. This pick makes no sense. You're setting the guy up to either get cut or keep around on your roster for years unnecessarily because you're too stubborn to admit what a dumb pick it was, ala Isaiah Pead."
StLouisRams,34l4td,m0pi1,1 point,Sat May 2 03:12:43 2015 UTC,"Oregon State Student here. Mannion is going to be a great QB for your guys. He has an NFL arm for sure. He needs big recievers that go for the ball. But this guy, im looking forward to see how he fights for the 1st team. Congrats Rams!"
StLouisRams,34l4td,beccacs,1 point,Sat May 2 12:34:51 2015 UTC,"Total homer here as a Beaver fan,  but I think it's a good pick for you guys.   Riley coached a pro style offense,  with similar language and plays,  so he won't take too long to get ready with the play book.  He also had a good arm  and pocket presence.  He will need to work on checking through his progressions and planting for throws.  He has no problem hanging in the pocket waiting for plays to develop, sometimes to his detriment.   You're looking at a guy who broke PAC-10 (12) records (granted,  he had Cooks for awhile), and is a competitor.   Go Beavs,  and Go Sean!  Also,  Go Niners."

StLouisRams,34l4td,4Signs,6,Sat May 2 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"I'd watched them both lose to the Ducks defense. Hundley made awful decisions last game and both guys lose their heads under pressure (at this stage of their development). Hundley couldn't even scramble or roll-out effectively. Mannion made better decisions and has a better arm.   All-time Pac-12 yardage leader over, who, Elway, Luck, Carson Palmer? Those are some high ceilings. Sounds like a chance I would take.   Def. should sit for a year or two though."
StLouisRams,34l4td,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,4,Sat May 2 02:54:22 2015 UTC,"From what i'm hearing its the intangibles. Three time team captain set pac 12 records for career passing yards. Plus he lines up under center and actually has to make pre snap reads. Out of the guys left he's the most nfl ready. Hopefully we made the right choice, i have a good feeling about this one!"
StLouisRams,34l4td,DAM1313,-6,Sat May 2 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"Wasted pick. Gonna be another Garret Gilbert kind of guy.  I know this draft was relatively weak, but I'm really not liking a lot of our picks.  A lot of guys getting taken too early"
StLouisRams,34l4td,Chancers12,3,Sat May 2 03:15:02 2015 UTC,Well you should've called Fisher with your in depth analysis of the draft! Now according to you we are making bad picks and dooming our team!
StLouisRams,34l4td,DAM1313,2,Sat May 2 02:58:51 2015 UTC,Oregon state fan here. Last 2 oregon state qbs drafted were matt moore and Derek Anderson. Mannion is better than either of them so imo the worst you got is an above average backup qb.

That is, unless you can provide proof that you work in the NFL in some sort of role evaluating talent. I don't post here much and I don't know if it's always been like that or what, but it really is mindnumbing."
StLouisRams,34l4td,bleedblue89,5,Sat May 2 03:18:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of hivemind thinking.  We already have two backup QBs on the roster who both know the offense inside and out.  This was a wasted pick.  Foles hasn't even played a fucking snap yet and people want to groom his successor.  Utter nonsense.  See what the guy can do for a season and if he can't cut it, you go out and draft a real QB next year."
StLouisRams,34l2cm,BrawndoTTM,13,Sat May 2 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it, we'd have scouted OL way harder than most teams out there. The surprising picks that look like reaches may simply be a result of the fact that we did better research than a lot of other teams."

StLouisRams,34l038,lakerfan91,10,Sat May 2 02:06:03 2015 UTC,I think we use our extra 3rd rounder on a QB now.

StLouisRams,34nc5n,bwc_28,2,Sat May 2 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"What do you expect to get for him? He's a good player with high upside, but it's abundantly clear we have no use for him and he openly stated he doesn't want to be a Ram anymore. The only way we're going to fetch a good price for him is if there's a bidding war."
StLouisRams,34nc5n,BrawndoTTM,0,Sat May 2 20:05:10 2015 UTC,It's abundantly clear we have no use for him since we just drafted a first round RB. We should have traded him before the draft when we could've reasonably got a fifth round pick. Now everyone knows he's gone and has no trade value. That's what makes it a joke.

StLouisRams,34nc5n,cardsfan1343,2,Sat May 2 19:50:46 2015 UTC,Yes I think they will. I could see the colts trading for him. They need a backup rb cause gore isn't going to last much longer
StLouisRams,34nc5n,Quasimdo,1 point,Sat May 2 19:29:15 2015 UTC,I think we should. Zac has a chance to be a starter on a team and that last thing i want is for us to prevent a player from reaching their full potential. I always felt bad for steven jackson when he played for us because he was such a beast on such a terrible team at the time. Not saying the stacy situation is the same but still i think hes good enough to be a starter on another team and i think we should do it.
StLouisRams,34nc5n,MANUTD4LYFE,1 point,Sat May 2 20:03:43 2015 UTC,I'd like to see them trade Zac for a decent starting o-lineman who we could plug in if these rookies don't work out

StLouisRams,34ku4o,BrawndoTTM,5,Sat May 2 01:39:56 2015 UTC,"Rok's weakness was he was incredibly lazy. No reports about that with Havenstein, and not exactly something Wisconsin is known for with their tackles."
StLouisRams,34ku4o,bwc_28,2,Sat May 2 01:50:06 2015 UTC,People are calling it a reach but idgaf. He's a run blocking mauler.
StLouisRams,34ku4o,MisterDoctorAwesome,12,Sat May 2 01:28:57 2015 UTC,Like the pick.  Wonder if this means we are not planning on Barksdale returning.
StLouisRams,34ku4o,Opifex,5,Sat May 2 01:07:35 2015 UTC,"does anyone know if Barksdale can play guard? If he can, we should still try to resign him because we need depth too, even our backups would be like 4th string on other teams"

You will be getting a guy with elite work ethic, he's a student of the game with an amazing football IQ - those two qualities alone for a rookie olinemen are very uncommon in the NFL  He's not only a RT either granted that's where he played his college career, he has the ability to play all 5 spots along the line and there's  nothing wrong with having a 6'8 guard like some people in this comment section want to believe.  This reminds me of the Cowboys reaction to Travis Frederick, time will tell how Rob pans out but I believe they will be very similar"
StLouisRams,34ku4o,GodOfWineAndTitz,7,Sat May 2 02:44:28 2015 UTC,Man you guys got a great guy. Not gonna lie I'm a little biased because I graduated with the guy but he is incredibly smart at football. May not put up the athletic numbers you want but he makes up for it in his smarts. He may put up 16 reps but that doesn't matter if he is able to block the right people. Rarely let up sacks if at all. Massive dude that was 380 when he graduated HS and is now down to 320 and is solid. I'm a skins fan and when you play us on September 20th I'm rooting for you guys.  Edit: word

StLouisRams,34ku4o,MisterDoctorAwesome,5,Sat May 2 01:37:24 2015 UTC,"100% agree. He's going to have trouble at Guard and man it would be tough for Foles to look over the middle with this behemoth in front of him.  With Robinson on the left and Havenstein on the right, we potentially have bookend mauler T. Not typical of NFL offenses, so hopefully they can get their pass blocking ironed out."
StLouisRams,34ku4o,Sauceman87,3,Sat May 2 01:40:41 2015 UTC,"I heard he only plays right tackle, nothing else."

StLouisRams,34ku4o,jratreddit,3,Sat May 2 03:03:23 2015 UTC,Can he play guard if we need him to?  I'd love to keep Barksdale on the right and plug in this huge dude at guard.

StLouisRams,34ku4o,jratreddit,7,Sat May 2 02:55:23 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of this pick.  Below average athletically and is limited to only playing RT.  Size is there but doesn't provide the versatility we need on the line.  Also, this pick prety much means Barksdale is going somewhere else."
StLouisRams,34ku4o,pmartin1707,5,Sat May 2 01:10:46 2015 UTC,I mean isn't it good if he's only going to play RT? I'm kind of expecting the guy we took second overall to be the LT for many years to come...
StLouisRams,34ku4o,ImTheBestMayne,1 point,Sat May 2 01:58:08 2015 UTC,Correct but I was really hoping we could bring back Barksdale to play RT.  Not a Pro Bowler but has played consistent football for the last 2 years for us.  Spending a second round pick on an interior lineman to fill in at Guard or Center would have made more sense to me.
StLouisRams,34ku4o,pmartin1707,1 point,Sat May 2 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"No you're right, I really hope we can resign Barksdale still so that we don't have to throw rookies in right away and they can develop. I think they're going to have Brown play guard but center might still up in the air"
StLouisRams,34ku4o,ImTheBestMayne,1 point,Sat May 2 21:30:38 2015 UTC,He moves inside. Possible even a center. Who knows. I'm completely dumbfounded by this pick.
StLouisRams,34ku4o,TheDuke13,2,Sat May 2 01:11:28 2015 UTC,"maybe he could play guard but he is slow off the line and isn't athletic enough to do pulls.  Also, he had benched the least at the combine so I'm not sure if he has the strength to match up with DTs"

If he has even the potential to be a top back, he could be what we need to get over the hump and make a playoff run in the near future.  He was the best guy available in a shallow draft, and we really have nothing to lose by taking him. The best linesmen were gone, and we can always grab some in later rounds without reaching down to get one."
StLouisRams,34k6yw,Fungo,2,Fri May 1 22:29:50 2015 UTC,"It doesn't fix our problems on the line, but an overlooked skill for Gurley is his pass blocking.

StLouisRams,34k9lr,MANUTD4LYFE,5,Sat May 2 00:53:15 2015 UTC,"Guy is massive. Seems like, with his size, he'll be slotting in at RT. Which means Barksdale won't be coming back or if we re-sign him he may be playing RG."
StLouisRams,34k9lr,bozo7337,5,Sat May 2 01:10:10 2015 UTC,I am always okay with drafting giant farm boys from the midwest
StLouisRams,34k9lr,kawikaboy12,4,Sat May 2 01:10:14 2015 UTC,I'm hoping they just plan to blast OL from here and hope something sticks.
StLouisRams,34k9lr,Wuiji,4,Fri May 1 23:56:16 2015 UTC,Anybody else excited as hell for this second rounder? At this point I'd love Gregory or La'El. Why not? Let's just go full Jeff Fisher.
StLouisRams,34k9lr,kawikaboy12,3,Sat May 2 00:34:40 2015 UTC,I could see us grabbing Strong if he's there. If we pass on him this time I don't see him being around in the 20's.
StLouisRams,34k9lr,frankoftank,2,Sat May 2 01:45:15 2015 UTC,"Nope, there goes Strong."
StLouisRams,34k9lr,BrawndoTTM,2,Sat May 2 01:51:57 2015 UTC,Yup. God damn it.
StLouisRams,34k9lr,porkfish66,5,Sat May 2 01:52:24 2015 UTC,Glad we picked another offensive lineman. Don't know anything about brown but I'm sure fisher and Snead know what their doing. Hoping we go for a cb or olb with our next pick
StLouisRams,34k9lr,BrawndoTTM,4,Sat May 2 02:10:47 2015 UTC,"La'el Collins isn't getting drafted you can book that right now. Teams are going to stay the hell away from a guy who could potentially face murder charges and he said he won't sign with a team that drafts him after day 2.    I'm not a huge fan of Mannion but he has upside and I love the first 3 picks and how they make us a beefy run team. It's clear that Fisher wants a lot of running and play action fakes to play ball control while our defense beats the shit out of the other teams. Think about it for a second our 2 guards and 2 tackles all are 6'4"" or more and 330lbs."

StLouisRams,34k9lr,NinjaChucho,1 point,Sat May 2 00:26:36 2015 UTC,It was the pick before ours. Titans took DGB. Carolina wanted Funchess.
StLouisRams,34k9lr,Opifex,1 point,Sat May 2 00:28:33 2015 UTC,Oh I looked at it wrong then. I thought Carolina took DGB. I was heading out the door as it happened

StLouisRams,34k9lr,thisbeareatsbacon,1 point,Sat May 2 02:31:13 2015 UTC,"He's said if he's not picked tonight he'll refuse to play this season and re-enter the draft next year. Might as well take a flyer on him with that extra pick. Like you said, he's not a suspect."
StLouisRams,34k9lr,Opifex,2,Sat May 2 02:39:08 2015 UTC,I would rather grab a QB with this next pick but you're right. If he doesn't get selected tonight he's going to hold out. Do we take the risk? Tough call.
StLouisRams,34k9lr,bleedblue89,2,Sat May 2 02:41:08 2015 UTC,As much as I want Hundley the value for Collins here would be crazy.

StLouisRams,34j2ii,The_Wayward,3,Fri May 1 16:01:19 2015 UTC,im hoping for TJ Clemmings
StLouisRams,34j2ii,vrock627,3,Fri May 1 19:39:53 2015 UTC,"Also a great option! Slipped my mind so...  T.J. Clemmings, Pittsburgh:  STRENGTHS: Boasts exciting tools and may ultimately wind up the best of the 2015 offensive tackle crop. Prototypical frame for the modern left tackle with broad shoulders, long arms (34 7/8""), a trim middle and thick thighs. Demonstrates fluidity, quickness and athleticism that are ideal for a next-level tackle. Uses his wide base to cut off edge rushers and adjust to multiple rushers coming his way, meeting them with stone hands and violently disposing of bodies. Utilizes long arms and a rapid, fluid kick-slide to stall and mirror opponents on the edge, and considering his lack of experience on the O-line, is surprisingly consistent with his technique - particularly his footwork. Shows good natural flexibility in his lower half to bend on contact, and as a run blocker can fire through to the second level where he has the ability to square up and target effectively in space. The athleticism and ability to pick things up quickly are both apparent.  WEAKNESSES: Looks more the part of a left tackle prospect than a right tackle considering his finesse style and leaner frame. He needs to improve hand placement as a pass-blocker, and will drop his shoulder and head on contact at times. A bit stiff in the hips, struggling to re-direct to counter moves back inside, an issue that was exposed on multiple occasions at the Senior Bowl.  COMPARES TO: Sebastian Vollmer, New England: Like Vollmer (a native of Germany with little football experience prior to college), Clemmings is rough around the edges but boasts undeniable upside. With a similar committment towards improvement as Vollmer has shown with the Patriots, Clemmings could emerge as a standout right tackle in the NFL or perhaps even flip to the all-important left tackle position after acclimating to the NFL's speed.   And here are some of them highlights."
StLouisRams,34j2ii,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,2,Fri May 1 19:44:16 2015 UTC,"More Players!  Jake Fisher, Oregon:  STRENGTHS: Has broad shoulders, long arms and quick, strong hands to latch onto opponents. He's strong enough to catch and control defenders and does a nice job of turning them away from the action. He plays with good knee bend and on the balls of his feet, helping him to anchor and mirror effectively. Fisher is a very effective double-team blocker, releasing from one target to hit another. He is a selfless, passionate and versatile player whose blue-collar style was appreciated by the coaching staff.  WEAKNESSES: More of a technician than an elite athlete and will struggle to handle the speed rushers of the NFL. He does not possess top-notch initial quickness and fluidity in his kick-slide. Struggles to balance and recover if beaten off the ball. Shows the knee-bend to anchor, but can get himself in trouble when his feet stop moving and as he tires and loses the leverage battle.   Jake Fisher doing beast things with the Ducks.  Rob Havenstein, Wisconsin:  STRENGTHS: Mammoth man with thickness throughout. Stout with the strength to absorb contact and hold his ground. Physical mauler with the ideal OL mentality. Great length to protect the edge. Adequate initial quickness for a man his size. Could charge cab fare to get around him due to his height and long reach (33 1/2-inch arms). Flashes ability to surprise with initial quickness as a run blocker, getting to the second level fairly fluidly for a man of his size. Highly dependable player who played in 55 games over the past four years (Senior Bowl included).  WEAKNESSES: Limited to right guard in the NFL with ordinary athleticism for the position and will be vulnerable against NFL speed rushers. Lacks elite lateral quickness with some hip and joint stiffness that keeps him from being a natural bender. Tends to bend at the waist. Will overextend himself with inconsistent body control. Surprisingly quick to the second level but fails to re-direct to hit moving targets.  Quick, quick highlight real for Rob."

StLouisRams,34jaec,BrawndoTTM,2,Fri May 1 22:32:28 2015 UTC,"Do you guys think Gurley actually doesn't want to play for us? A lot of people are saying that. I think (hope) it's just media drama, but I'm a bit concerned. I can't deny that he hardly sounds excited about being a top 10 pick. Most people would be ecstatic in his situation, especially considering he's coming off an ACL injury and was being projected in the second/late first in a lot of mocks. He seems even less interested in being a Ram than McDavid did when Edmonton won the draft lottery (if you follow hockey). Maybe I'm just being a worrywort, but frankly this concerns me even more than his injury history."
StLouisRams,34jaec,ClitorisNigga,5,Sat May 2 02:20:25 2015 UTC,Check some earlier interviews with him from college. He has always been like that.
StLouisRams,34jaec,RamsWillFly,3,Fri May 1 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMiF1DGHzGk found this tho and he seemed really happy there, almost in tears."
StLouisRams,34jaec,BrawndoTTM,3,Fri May 1 19:32:05 2015 UTC,Maybe he was just very emotional and/or in shock and that's why he wasn't jumping up and down. I'm going to go with that. It's also possible that he's really media shy like Marshawn Lynch. But either way that video definitely paints a more optimistic picture of his motivation then the call or how he looked when they called his name.
StLouisRams,34jaec,collusioncola,4,Fri May 1 19:20:56 2015 UTC,He may have been hoping for a softer division.
StLouisRams,34jaec,RamsWillFly,2,Fri May 1 19:30:10 2015 UTC,I was thinkin the Same thing. He doesn't really sound excited about anything. When he got drafted he didnt smile. Listened to an interview with him he sounded sad almost... and on the phone here with Fisher he didn't seem too happy.... Now Fisher is saying he wanted to be here in the fist place? doesn't add up to me. Hopefully when he meets the players he will start to open up a bit.
StLouisRams,34jaec,ndaly87,3,Fri May 1 19:32:40 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to his interview on stage with Susie Colbert, I think it was because he was choked up with the heaviness and reality of the situation, like that he actually made it this far/top-10 pick with the suspension and injury. I think that's why he didn't smile at first either. If you watch him when his name is called he's kind of biting his cheek and it looks like he's trying to hold back some emotion. He's a very reserved guy in the spotlight, very quiet when he's not with his friends so I think that's why he wasn't saying anything on the phone. I say this cause I come from Georgia and worked in the athletic department. Y'all got one hell of a guy."
StLouisRams,34jaec,ItsBiggy,1 point,Fri May 1 19:13:49 2015 UTC,He's not an emotional guy in any of his interviews. Don't know why his personality would be evidence that he doesn't want to play for us

StLouisRams,34ii6o,ramSACKcity,11,Fri May 1 13:12:37 2015 UTC,"Because I was so focused on our need at OL, this pick caught me by complete surprise. But the more it settles in, the more I like it. The Rams have one of the best pedigrees of RBs, historically. We are a running team. Just since I can remember as a fan, Charles White, Eric Dickerson (still the single season rushing record holder), Jerome Bettis, Marshall Faulk, Steven Jackson. That's a hell of a list, and we were always best when we had a bell cow RB. The GSOT was amazing, but Faulk really made that show what it was. Madden practically gave him a reach-around every game. We have time to draft more OL. I hope Gurley pans out."
StLouisRams,34ii6o,ChalupaLoompa,7,Fri May 1 14:04:17 2015 UTC,"I agree. I suppose if ""The best RB prospect since Adrian Peterson"" is on the board, you take him."

StLouisRams,34ii6o,Thonked,4,Fri May 1 18:35:23 2015 UTC,I was hoping they would have picked Trae Waynes but hopefully Gurley can stay healthy and contribute. Time to finally unsubscribe /r/StacedGod
StLouisRams,34ii6o,grizwald85,3,Fri May 1 13:50:08 2015 UTC,I wanna see Foles in shotgun with Tre and Todd on each side and Tavon in the slot  drools
StLouisRams,34ii6o,WourningMood,1 point,Fri May 1 17:31:31 2015 UTC,I want to see Todd in Dickerson's #29
StLouisRams,34ii6o,lojafr,1 point,Fri May 1 21:34:07 2015 UTC,Won't happen but Bettis' 36 is an option and he'd be able to keep the 3 from college
StLouisRams,34ii6o,Bmallar1,1 point,Fri May 1 21:38:16 2015 UTC,If you watch the press conference He cringed when FIsher offered him 35 or something LOL
StLouisRams,34ii6o,lojafr,3,Fri May 1 21:51:47 2015 UTC,"Same exact thing happened with Steven Jackson back in 2004. He also had a knee injury that kept him out of the combine and fell to the Rams (well, they traded up a couple of spots with denver and cincy). He was the first running back taken.  I still remember a video of the Rams' war room erupting when they picked him."
StLouisRams,34ii6o,bretris,1 point,Fri May 1 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"What's the status in his rehab, though? If he doesn't play or doesn't play at least at the his college level, he's not a good pick."
StLouisRams,34ii6o,mananiux,2,Fri May 1 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"I think he will be out for the first half of the season.  We have Tre, so that's alright.  I wouldn't be worried about his skill level, just worried about the chance of re-injury.  We should give him all the time he needs to rehab."
StLouisRams,34j5y7,Graupers,9,Fri May 1 16:29:02 2015 UTC,Honestly I am slowly getting more and more excited for this pick.  Fisher and Snead know what they are doing.  A backfield with Mason and Gurley is going to help Foles as it will open up their secondary.
StLouisRams,34j5y7,One_Half_Hamster,5,Fri May 1 18:03:22 2015 UTC,I am not concerned with his recovery. I am concerned about re-injury.
StLouisRams,34j5y7,JaKha,2,Fri May 1 19:06:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly, but hey Adrian Peterson proved he can do it.  Plus Gurley injured it when ACL injury treatment is way better than even when AP injured his."
StLouisRams,34j5y7,ramSACKcity,6,Sat May 2 16:00:09 2015 UTC,I thought the main concern will be cutting not running.
StLouisRams,34j5y7,mlasn,1 point,Fri May 1 19:41:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, but they take things one step at a time, so seeing him run already means that he is making great headway in his recovery.  His determination is impressive, and from the way he handled his press conference and interview with ESPN, he seems like a stand up guy."
StLouisRams,34j5y7,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Fri May 1 21:23:29 2015 UTC,It is.  ACL's tear on non-contact cutting action.  Seeing him make aggressive cuts on a field will be a big step forward.
StLouisRams,34j5y7,daedalus000,2,Fri May 1 22:34:30 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ why did they stop it that fast??
StLouisRams,34l2wo,mcthsn,3,Sat May 2 02:32:28 2015 UTC,I have a hunch Brett Hundley is the pick.
StLouisRams,34l2wo,Seductive_Santa,2,Sat May 2 02:36:37 2015 UTC,QB? That would be interesting. Watching highlights now!
StLouisRams,34l2wo,Seductive_Santa,2,Sat May 2 02:39:49 2015 UTC,"He's a physical beast, but would need a redshirt year under Foles. Loved him at UCLA!"
StLouisRams,34l2wo,MisterDoctorAwesome,2,Sat May 2 02:41:09 2015 UTC,He's really fast.
StLouisRams,34l2wo,mlasn,2,Sat May 2 02:42:26 2015 UTC,I'm hoping Paul Dawson or Derron Smith.
StLouisRams,34iozb,jts81,5,Fri May 1 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"I've warmed up to Gurley and think it was a reasonable pick, given the BPA strategy.  Gurley, Mason, and Cunningham fresh at all times behind a run-blocking OL could work really quite nicely.  I really do think that tonight we'll go OL rather than a strict BPA policy.  As good as Coach Boudreau is, you've gotta throw him a bone at some point."
StLouisRams,34iozb,collusioncola,4,Fri May 1 14:15:48 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that it's the ultimate high risk/high reward pick. You've got to think that at this point the plan is to resign Barksdale. Now, if Jake Fisher or TJ Clemmings falls to us in round 2, along with Barksdale... well suddenly you've got a competent o line! And I don't think they'll stop there .. there's talk of AJ Cann slipping to the third, and I LOVE him at the guard spot. Also, it wouldn't be beyond the Snisher to take a fourth round flyer on La'el Collins...  if THAT pans out, it would be the steal of the draft!   I'm nervous, yes, but I trust Snisher's draft prowess, and if the cards fall right, this might be a ridiculously good pick"
StLouisRams,34iozb,jts81,1 point,Fri May 1 15:00:00 2015 UTC,The Rams offensive and defensive lines are already the best tandem in football. No need to make it better...
StLouisRams,34iozb,collusioncola,6,Fri May 1 19:26:59 2015 UTC,What? Our o line is horrid! And it only has two people signed on it and a few backups!
StLouisRams,34iozb,jts81,2,Fri May 1 19:28:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, I admit, I hadn't followed the decline of the Rams OL in 2014. It appears everyone received a negative grade last year except Roger Saffold. And with Jake Long gone, it needs some attention. Especially after drafting Gurley. But doesn't it feel like the Rams have been spending top picks on the OL and DL for the past 3 years?"
StLouisRams,34iozb,nhuff90,1 point,Fri May 1 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"Well that tends to be how you build a successful team. And Robinson was our first round one offensive lineman selected in the Snead/Fisher era. The previous two regimes drafted a lot of first round lineman, but we're fucking terrible at it. The jury is still out on Robinson, but he was massively better the second half of the season and there's no reason that shouldn't continue. Saffold is always good and can play any spot except center. We've got three young centers with plenty of potential but little experience.... Barnes, Barrett, Rhaney. It seems like Fisher wants to start one of them. Barksdale has never been a star, but he's solid at right tackle, and the best option left in free agency. If they can sign him and come out of the draft with two viable starting lineman (Fisher or Clemmings and Cann, please) THEN Todd Gurley could be a force to be reckoned with. And mason."
StLouisRams,34iozb,price-iz-right,5,Fri May 1 20:11:46 2015 UTC,Do we take a flyer on La'el Collins?  Or trade up for Jake Fisher?
StLouisRams,34iozb,phaneuf_fan_3,6,Fri May 1 15:00:36 2015 UTC,"Fisher's history points towards taking a chance on Collins, so I wouldn't be surprised there.  Could be an exciting steal."
StLouisRams,34iozb,Mace_Windu_is_Black,3,Fri May 1 16:32:33 2015 UTC,He got off field issues but that's never stopped fisher before. Interesting.
StLouisRams,34iozb,Mace_Windu_is_Black,1 point,Fri May 1 15:43:23 2015 UTC,"This is like a perfect fit. If we can snag him its worth taking a chance imo. Might be too early to pick him though, would be nice if we could get him with a 6."
StLouisRams,34iozb,Daytwa313,4,Fri May 1 23:46:04 2015 UTC,Lol I love Fisher somehow being awkward on this slightly too long phone call to Gurley just before the pick went in.
StLouisRams,34iozb,price-iz-right,5,Fri May 1 16:37:04 2015 UTC,I think Fisher was more excited than Gurley was.
StLouisRams,34iozb,mlasn,3,Fri May 1 18:00:49 2015 UTC,But I want to believe Gurley is excited!
StLouisRams,34iozb,valt10,2,Fri May 1 18:29:26 2015 UTC,Oh he is. But its saying something too see Fisher this excited.
StLouisRams,34iozb,Thracion,2,Fri May 1 18:49:17 2015 UTC,Haha very awkward indeed
StLouisRams,34iozb,corbilm,3,Fri May 1 20:46:53 2015 UTC,"A lot of polar opposites on the Gurley pick across all the subs.  I like the pick, we are a smash mouth football team and our offense should be focused on our run game with a serviceable pass game  Our biggest team need is O line. This OL class is lacking so I see an O line pick in round 2.   Bottom line none of us know shit, and men make lots of money to analyze this shit and make those decisions. We aren't factoring in the new offensive scheme or what the way ahead for the team is, only Snead and fisher know that.  We will all have to wait and see. Gurley could be a bust off an injury or be our next Faulk.  Hindsight will most certainly be 20/20 on this one, but run blocking maulers for O lineman should be the way forward. Foles is just going to have to stay mobile in the pocket and find the open receiver to keep the defenses honest this year.  I foresee long low scoring games of tre, benny, and Gurley pounding the middle then play action to Britt and Quick for the big plays.   Our defense is solid and could use some secondary, but honestly I think we need o line more than secondary at this point.  OL for the rest of the draft wouldn't make me mad at all.  Just my 2 cents. I'm no expert."
StLouisRams,34iozb,4Signs,3,Fri May 1 15:42:09 2015 UTC,I'm okay with it now also because I didn't really like any OL available at 10 and think our WR core is fine. There are still some decent tackles available and if we can grab either a tackle or guard in the second and center in the third I will be fine with the draft.
StLouisRams,34iozb,LarryCsonkasStache,3,Fri May 1 16:13:53 2015 UTC,"I get the ""high risk, high reward"" aspect, but I guess I just don't trust Snead and Fisher that much. They've had a few busts on offense that have set us back.  Fisher's ""We've got a good group up front [on the O-Line]"" comment also worries me, though that's probably meaningless."
StLouisRams,34iozb,ClitorisNigga,2,Fri May 1 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"As a coach, you never say, ""Yeah, our O-Line is bad and needs work,"" as that discourages the guys you already have, they need to feel confidence.  It was probably just a safe statement."
StLouisRams,34h4c6,jc316,33,Fri May 1 02:35:26 2015 UTC,More lopsided than the RG3 trade.
StLouisRams,34h4c6,minorthreat21,13,Fri May 1 02:39:33 2015 UTC,I'd rather have dog shit on my shoe than Schottenheimer.
StLouisRams,34h4c6,porkfish66,10,Fri May 1 02:57:53 2015 UTC,I laughed too hard at this.
StLouisRams,34h4c6,corbilm,3,Fri May 1 03:32:44 2015 UTC,hahaha great point.  Schotty would still be running TA between the tackles while gurley/mason/stacy sit back and wait to pick up the left over body parts
StLouisRams,34h4c6,ozarkslam21,2,Fri May 1 13:21:21 2015 UTC,Shotty + a 1st round pick... just to clarify
StLouisRams,34igth,rammmy,1 point,Fri May 1 12:59:10 2015 UTC,didn't we take Mason in the 3rd round last year? he said 4th.
StLouisRams,34kmpz,The49ersBlow,16,Fri May 1 23:51:12 2015 UTC,"We got their second as well.   So picks 57, 89, and 201. I'm chill with that."
StLouisRams,34kmpz,minorthreat21,2,Fri May 1 23:54:31 2015 UTC,"Oh sweet. The NFL.com tracker wasn't showing that pick at first. That is worth it, especially after DGB went a pick before."
StLouisRams,34kmpz,amanoob,7,Fri May 1 23:57:34 2015 UTC,DGB was probably our pick until he got picked and we hit the trade.
StLouisRams,34kmpz,RHCPent,4,Sat May 2 00:02:49 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that's the case too.
StLouisRams,34kmpz,RamsWillFly,1 point,Sat May 2 00:05:02 2015 UTC,"Ahh idk about that, it would have been a terrible move to keep him near Springfield and all the dumbass people that helped him get in trouble. I said for a long time if he would have get/got drafted by stl or KC it would have been the worse move either team could make."
StLouisRams,34kmpz,Cloud324,6,Sat May 2 01:15:56 2015 UTC,"so we got 1 2nd round pick, 2 3rd round picks(one from Carolina), 1 4th round pick, two six round picks (another from Car), and a 7th rd pick.  Thats pretty sweet, that can give us at least two O-linemen and another option in the 2n/3rd round."
StLouisRams,34kmpz,Ethanhekker,3,Sat May 2 00:02:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm liking this set up too. That is one thing I love about Snead and Fisher. They move around every draft. When Atlanta started doing that, I was envious. Then we hired Billy D from Atlanta, but he was too scared to make moves ever it seemed."
StLouisRams,34j3jp,asheepysheep,10,Fri May 1 16:09:38 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's a lot to live up to.  If you think Steven Jackson, LaDanian Tomlinson, AP, Lynch, Ricky Williams, Faulk - those guys were first rounders and worth every cent of a first round pick.  I'm guessing Fisher sees that kind of talent in this guy.  He seems like a smart kid and hard worker, so I'm excited about the pick.  He IS a beast.  Also, the league is protecting WR more and we are seeing more bubble screens and things, so WRs are able to be smaller, quicker guys.  Big receivers are still coveted, but there are more ""slot""-type guys on rosters now, which is bringing value back to the true three-down centerpiece RB.  (at least in terms of draft value)"
StLouisRams,34j3jp,adamlikescheetos,6,Fri May 1 17:02:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's a win now strategy. With so many first round picks in the past few years, I would think the Rams have a window of 2-3 years before they have to pay all those guys. The key to winning the super bowl is getting to the playoffs. The Rams are just shy of being the best team in this division. The passing game has been mediocre, which may be remedied with Foles. If the Rams can combine a strong rushing game with good play-action passing, they stand a decent chance at taking the division."
StLouisRams,34j3jp,collusioncola,2,Fri May 1 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"All good points but if it were a win now strategy, wouldnt they go with someone who didnt just tear an ACL? Perhaps they have info we dont about his recovery time but odds are they know he wont contribute much next year. Would have drafted someone not injured if immediate help was the true goal."
StLouisRams,34j3jp,chubbupp,1 point,Sat May 2 03:21:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty good depth at RB to allow him fewer reps to heal. They could bench him and let him heal/adjust to the scheme. He will be ready by playoffs, which is when he would be needed if all goes well."
StLouisRams,34j3jp,collusioncola,3,Sat May 2 03:31:35 2015 UTC,"We probably couldn't have waited since Melvin Gordon was snagged at 15, and with Gurley being the number 1 running back prospect I can only imagine if we hadn't taken him, the Chargers would have."
StLouisRams,34j3jp,impossiber,2,Fri May 1 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean they could wait AND get Gurley. I just mean in general, you can get a back capable of being in the top 10 in rushing outside the top 10 picks. And since you can, it makes living up to that top 10 selection more difficult."
StLouisRams,34j3jp,impossiber,2,Fri May 1 16:49:32 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with it because he keeps getting called the best prospect since AP. I would say that's worth a high pick, especially when the players we were hoping for got taken. That's just my opinion though."
StLouisRams,34j3jp,bwc_28,3,Fri May 1 17:02:45 2015 UTC,"He really needs to be the next Marshawn Lynch at the very least, otherwise this was a wasted pick."
StLouisRams,34j3jp,A__Black__Guy,2,Fri May 1 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"UGA fan here.  You guys hit the lottery.  You got  ""3esus""!  The most explosive human being I have ever seen run the football.  He's big, he's fast, like world class sprinter fast.  He ccatches the ball out of the back field.  He returns kicks like a boss, he can beat you to the outside kr run you over.  He also happens to be very nice softspoken person.  There is a reason he went from a projected 2nd rounder to the 10th pick over the last few months."
StLouisRams,34imft,NewBroPewPew,2,Fri May 1 13:52:24 2015 UTC,Man I love the Fisher/Snead combo.

StLouisRams,34gxhq,amanoob,1 point,Fri May 1 05:35:24 2015 UTC,Most here are saying best available but it is more than that. I think rams were picking him no matter what. We are a Run first defense team. Gurley is the best RB to come out of the draft since Adrian Peterson.

StLouisRams,34gvc6,Ethanhekker,7,Fri May 1 01:20:42 2015 UTC,Gurley is already a gamble with his injury problem. We should be definitely set at RB ... It's like the Kings picking another shooting guard if you know basketball. Our WRs and Scherff were taken. We could've traded this pick for a good asset if they were taken.

Towards the end, one reported asked the right question:  Reporter: ""I gotta be the smartass; who does he run behind?"" Snead: ""From what I understand, it's a three day event. Sorry you have to wait until Friday and Saturday - but we're aware.""  I'm coming down to earth and accepting the pick a bit more. I hated AP as a prospect because of the injury and he turned out great. He's a special player - let's see where Gurley is."

StLouisRams,34gvc6,thedude37,3,Fri May 1 03:22:43 2015 UTC,"Fish looks so uncomfortable.  ""My polo shirt, where's my polo shirt?"""
StLouisRams,34gvc6,CplPJ,59,Fri May 1 12:43:42 2015 UTC,"Holy shit.  Do you guys realize.  All our linemen are mauling, run blocking guys rather than pass blocking masters.  We will have Gurley or Mason fresh at all times.  ...Will Foles even have anything to do?"
StLouisRams,34gvc6,FaulktheBlueRedbird,19,Fri May 1 01:20:24 2015 UTC,"Dude our O-Line still needs work, but we were sort of just screwed the moment we gambled on Jake Long a few years ago. We went for Robinson, who will hopefully be truly coming into form this year.  But today, Scherff and Flowers were gone, and Peat is a 21 year old kid who played tackle, not guard (which is more pressing for us). This draft just wasn't the year to pick a 1st round O-Lineman, unless we were willing to go up for Scherff. All we can do now is draft some O-Lineman in the 2nd-3rd, resign Barksdale, and maul in the run the game.   We went for best possible player available in Gurley. I'm okay with it. Stacy will be gone, Cunningham on rotation, and Gurley/Mason can wreak havoc.  Let's do this."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,CplPJ,10,Fri May 1 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"I'm in agreement. I figured it was Waynes or Gurley once Cooper/White/Flowers/Scherff were gone. Honestly, no point in reaching for OL when Flowers wasn't even worth 10 IMO.  Plus, if we're going run heavy, can't hurt to have Gurley and Mason both going at defenses trying to earn the #1 spot."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,FaulktheBlueRedbird,3,Fri May 1 01:43:20 2015 UTC,I personally wanted Trae Waynes all the way! But we could have one of the most potent run games in the West if the we can patch up this O-Line.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,daedalus000,15,Fri May 1 01:44:44 2015 UTC,That's a good point.  If we can get OL in rounds 2 and 3 and re-sign Barksdale I'll be on board.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,ptabs226,8,Fri May 1 01:25:50 2015 UTC,Right. We need to sign a rt and get a rg and then add depth across the oline.   We went best player available with gurley
StLouisRams,34gvc6,nldarab,6,Fri May 1 02:15:23 2015 UTC,I'm slightly less mad now. Thank you.  Hope this works out!
StLouisRams,34gvc6,jsgg556,11,Fri May 1 01:27:13 2015 UTC,"Tim Barnes, Barrett Jones, and Brandon Washington are mauling, run blocking guys? I'm honestly asking because other than Jones, I don't recognize their names and they are 3/5 of the current O-line. Combined they have 4 career NFL starts. Jones has barely seen the field, and Barnes and Washington have both been waived by multiple teams."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,CplPJ,4,Fri May 1 01:38:09 2015 UTC,"I guarantee at least 2 of those guys won't be starting on our line. Robinson and Saffold can both run block well, as can Barksdale if we bring him back. Plus, that's been almost solely the type of linemen Fish and Snead have been drafting and bringing in. With the addition of Gurley, I'd bet even more confidently that they're continuing that trend rather than turning their philosophy of offense on its head to try to get linemen that will be pass block specialists."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,jsgg556,7,Fri May 1 01:46:05 2015 UTC,"All our linemen are mauling, run blocking guys  I guarantee at least 2 of those guys won't be starting on our line.... Robinson and Saffold can both run block well, as can Barksdale if we bring him back.   Okay, so by ""all"" you mean 2 of our current linemen are ""mauling, run blocking guys"" and for the remaining 3 positions, some guys who are not currently on the team will be mauling, run blocking guys.  If I was Todd Gurley, I would be a little worried."

I really like the Gurley pick long term though.  Lots of talent, limited mileage in college and has been compared to Adrian Peterson.  Only real question is the ACL which he's expected to make a full recovery from."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,ApertureScienc,1 point,Fri May 1 15:49:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not so much focused on the specifics of the draft. The Gurley pick just shows that Fisher is locked into trying to recreate the 2000-era Titans, never mind how the league has changed since then."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,LLv2,1 point,Fri May 1 17:25:34 2015 UTC,Our o-line is the weakest link on our team.  I don't think the real Jim Brown could do anything with all of the defensive linemen and linebackers who could be in the Rams' backfield by the time the ball is handed off.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,servvits_ban_boner,14,Fri May 1 03:06:28 2015 UTC,"Fisher obviously believes Gurley is a carry the offense type RB.  If he is right, this is the best pick we could have made.  We know Fisher will stick with a run first offense, no matter what.  Having a stable of good RB's is not the same as having an elite one.  I think once Gurley is healthy and up to speed he and Foles will be able to do some damage, finally, for the Rams offense."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,Juno_Malone,13,Fri May 1 01:22:01 2015 UTC,Well that's...not what I expected. They must have heard really positive things about his knee.

StLouisRams,34gvc6,Xonero,24,Fri May 1 01:18:47 2015 UTC,I'm so excited. A healthy Gurley will do damage. I can't wait!
StLouisRams,34gvc6,hb_alien,24,Fri May 1 01:16:21 2015 UTC,won't do shit behind our non-existent o-line.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,FaulktheBlueRedbird,14,Fri May 1 01:18:15 2015 UTC,Scherff and Flowers were just plain gone. Whoever we trade up/down for in the second-third rounds is the best we were going to get in this already shallow draft class.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,hb_alien,2,Fri May 1 01:20:11 2015 UTC,"Peat?  As in, why not draft him?"
StLouisRams,34gvc6,FaulktheBlueRedbird,5,Fri May 1 01:21:22 2015 UTC,"Because I don't think Peat is much better than Fisher, Humphries, or even Og or Clemmings by a large margin. He's an underclassmen and I don't think a 21 year old kid is going to come in and save our season.   Also, we're looking for a guard, not a tackle. A much easier position to transition to. Peat was a tackle."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,Blues2112,1 point,Fri May 1 01:25:07 2015 UTC,"Many NFL guards started out as OT, or played it in college.  Far easier to slide inside from Tackle to Guard than the reverse."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,MisterDoctorAwesome,5,Fri May 1 16:30:08 2015 UTC,He's overrated.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,Lewandirty,3,Fri May 1 01:23:48 2015 UTC,Peat at 10 is a reach. Similar players can probably be found in the second round.   Mort said the Rams had Gurley at 2 on their big board. They must think he's going to be something special.   I would rather get an elite talent than an average player at a position of need.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,CplPJ,10,Fri May 1 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"Mason did last year, and the only missing pieces from last year are Scott Wells (lol), Davin Joseph (lol), and Barksdale (maybe going to be back).  If we pick G/C in the 2nd and 3rd??? Could be a nasty run offense."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,hb_alien,6,Fri May 1 01:22:15 2015 UTC,That's 3/5 of our o-line that we haven't replaced yet.  Take away to Raiders game and he averaged 3.95 ypc.  Below average.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,CplPJ,5,Fri May 1 01:23:03 2015 UTC,2/3 of which almost literally can't get worse.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,bwc_28,2,Fri May 1 01:24:28 2015 UTC,Just imagine how bad it would have been if their backups had been playing instead. That's what we might be dealing with this season. Our offensive line might be an unmitigated disaster.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,vrock627,1 point,Fri May 1 03:04:11 2015 UTC,"you are over reacting. draft a guard in the 2nd or 3rd, resign barksdale and we are fine"
StLouisRams,34gvc6,bwc_28,1 point,Fri May 1 04:01:35 2015 UTC,"We have two starting linemen right now. Even if we draft two players they are completely unknown commodities, and most likely not high picks. That does not elicit confidence. Saying ""we're fine"" with two completely unproven o-line players is ridiculous.  Edit: and that's ignoring the fact that one of those draftees will have to play center. Coming in as a rookie center is just as difficult as a LT."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,vrock627,0,Fri May 1 04:05:39 2015 UTC,i only suggested drafting one lineman. i believe our starting center is already on the roster
StLouisRams,34gvc6,bwc_28,0,Fri May 1 04:08:44 2015 UTC,"Who? Jones? The guy who has barely played a snap in the NFL? Like I said, we have two proven starters on the roster, three if we re-sign Barksdale."

StLouisRams,34gvc6,reddit_on_my_phone,1 point,Fri May 1 01:29:13 2015 UTC,We should take a chance on la'ell Collins in the 7th. He's probably innocent and if not it's just a 7th rounder.

StLouisRams,34gvc6,RamsWillFly,2,Fri May 1 04:02:00 2015 UTC,I can't wait. Kind of feel bad for Mason was hoping to see him hit 1k yards but we need something explosive on this offense. Just hope he was worth that high of a pick.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,JiveTurkey92,8,Fri May 1 01:18:45 2015 UTC,He must be INSANELY good to draft a RB that early. was there nobody else available?
StLouisRams,34gvc6,quiquedont,9,Fri May 1 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"If he is not the offensive rookie or far and beyond the best rookie RB, the pick is crap."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,Wm_TheConqueror,0,Fri May 1 02:21:01 2015 UTC,"He won't be, he's going to be taking time rehabing his knee. He can't even take full contact yet."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,BoseSounddock,4,Fri May 1 16:16:50 2015 UTC,Not an UGA fan but an SEC fan and I've seen every conference game Gurley played all 3 years. He's incredible. First contact never brings him down. Leg tacklers bounce off of him. He's the best RB out of the SEC in a long fucking time. Way better than Ingram or Richardson and even better in college than Mcfadden. He's the best RB since AD and Bush.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,Felton11,8,Fri May 1 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"I know about the o line, but this Best Player Available philosophy is freaking awesome!"

StLouisRams,34gvc6,_Username_Colon_,3,Fri May 1 01:23:19 2015 UTC,I do too. He was the best player available and we can get someone as good as Peat in the second.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,pmartin1707,6,Fri May 1 02:15:05 2015 UTC,He's an athletic freak. Love the pick. Tre mason will be there to take snaps which helps with the injury concerns.

StLouisRams,34gvc6,pmartin1707,2,Fri May 1 16:41:02 2015 UTC,Most likely will have to cut Stacy. Best case is we trade him for a late round pick either in this draft or next years

They shouldn't need to worry about RB for the next 5-6 years now...he'll be one of the best in the league.    With the best OT's already gone, and apparently no reasonable trading partners to move down, they went with best player available.  I agree an O lineman would've been nice, but why reach at #10?  They'll sign a FA or two, and/or draft O-line in Rounds 2-3."

There was only one lineman that really has a chance to go in the next ten picks in andrus peat and he is a left tackle which we dont need.  He isnt suited to right tackle at all.  Do you want collins who will probably be there in round 2?  Do you want trae when we are arguably more stacked at cb than rb and dude is way over rated.  Devante parker is the only other pick i feel good with there.  Nobody wants a trade.   This was the best pick."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,Blues2112,1 point,Fri May 1 01:39:52 2015 UTC,"More stacked at CB?  Trumaine and Janoris are both FA's after this year.  Both have also had injury histories.  EJ Gaines could take over one of those slots, sure, but our CB depth isn't exactly great currently."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,hack5amurai,2,Fri May 1 16:39:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  we have three starting caliber corners and a 2nd rounder last year and third rounder the year before.  Could we use Sherman or revis,  sure,  but I don't think we get that in this draft.  And in the same vein, we could use ap or laveon bell,  and there is a much better chance gurley reaches that potential."

StLouisRams,34gvc6,Blues2112,2,Fri May 1 19:09:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not criticizing the pick, I'm just not on board with saying that we're deeper at CB (with 2-3x the # of starters needed) than we are at RB (with a single starter needed)."

StLouisRams,34gvc6,WhamBamCham2,5,Fri May 1 01:35:03 2015 UTC,We got rid of Bradfords acl's.  Needed a new injured acl to take its place.  Sucks that we have to wait for a top 10 draft pick to get healthy.

StLouisRams,34gvc6,darkblue91,3,Fri May 1 01:18:50 2015 UTC,Im trying to hype myself up. He was a highly rated prospect. everyone kind of agreed that there were about 6-8 elite prospects. He was one of them and we got him at 10. I guess the knee checks out and he will be a valuable weapon on offense having a similar effect as a wide out. Signing barksdale is now the number one priority. Maybe we can land fisher from Oregon in the second.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,TestUsernameIgnore,3,Fri May 1 01:23:55 2015 UTC,"BPA. Feel like only Waynes would be close to not being a reach, and thought all along that trading down wouldn't be easy as at 10 there just wouldn't be enough interest. Can always pick up OL in later rounds and wouldn't surprise me if Stacy or Brockers get shipped as part of a deal for picks in this first round."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,HeardsTheWord,3,Fri May 1 01:26:16 2015 UTC,"I know you are set at RB, but Gurley is an absolute stud. I watched every one of his games at UGA. Really jealous that you got him.   Can't wait to watch some Rams games this year."

Gurley when healthy should be a beast, especially between the tackles. Mason can be more of a 3rd down guy.   While none of us saw this coming, I think it will work out just fine. In Fish I trust"

Im ok with the pick, it wasn't my first choice, but it was the best choice. If he turns out to be good, then the rams got a steal"
StLouisRams,34gvc6,DocCrooks1050,1 point,Fri May 1 06:28:55 2015 UTC,"After having this pick settle in I am really liking it. Gurley has something Tre Mason doesn't and that's the potential to be an ELITE running back for a long time to come. Just go look at his pre-draft comparisons to AP or Beast Mode, how could anyone pass that up? Anyone remember when SJ39 was drafted? We sure wasted that pick with Faulk already on our team, you dumb old Rams! Now we have a solid two headed monster lining up behind Foles and that can be as deadly as any position on the field. Sure we needed a receiver and o-line but guess what, the big boys were gone. The only other pick I would of liked to see would of been Waynes but again I feel the payoff in the long run is most certainly with the legs of Gurley. Welcome to the Rams sir, we have a long history of franchise RBs hope you put your name with the greats."

StLouisRams,34gvc6,AmericanSamosa,6,Fri May 1 13:52:06 2015 UTC,"It was BPA and there's 6 other rounds to fill needs, chill."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,ITameFatGirls,-5,Fri May 1 01:16:52 2015 UTC,Ya but we got an injury prone guy at a position that was already filled by quality players.  He is a great player but I don't trust his knee or his game changing ability.
StLouisRams,34gvc6,LLv2,3,Fri May 1 01:23:57 2015 UTC,"His knee fair enough, but his ability as a game changer, you might be alone on that one, it's pretty apparent he's the best prospect since Peterson.  Time will tell.  41 Id expect an interior line man."
StLouisRams,34gvc6,KingRoyMustang,-1,Fri May 1 01:40:22 2015 UTC,Talk about not drafting to need. The only thing we needed less was defensive line.  This makes about as much sense as drafting a tight end.

StLouisRams,34gvuv,prolikewhoa,10,Fri May 1 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"All these guys are freaking out because we need o linemen, but they are forgetting that we have a draft plan. You don't just wing it like you guys seem to think. Gurley is going to be a beast and the franchise RB we haven't had since SJ39 (with a good defenss this time)."
StLouisRams,34gvuv,avanhokie,9,Fri May 1 02:03:19 2015 UTC,"exactly. Not to mention, do people have such short memories to not recall all the crappy OL picks this team has made since Orlando Pace?   Jason Smith? Alex Barron? Shall I go on?  Everything's connected to everything else. You can bitch about having a great RB and no one to block for him, or you can bitch about drafting an OL and (if you FINALLY get lucky and get a good one) having a mid-level RB who is not a top tier skill player behind that OL to only be pretty good.  Football's a team game, but big players make big plays. This team hasn't had a skill player of his caliber in quite some time now on offense.....about as long as its been since this team's sniffed the playoffs. Coincidence?"
StLouisRams,34gvuv,txyesboy,5,Fri May 1 02:11:39 2015 UTC,And then you have your guys like Scott Wells who started for a long time and if I remember correctly was a 7th round pick. I trust Sneed. I haven't been unhappy with a draft since he took over.
StLouisRams,34gvuv,impossiber,2,Fri May 1 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"Correct. In fact, if you didn't know exactly when Sneed took over, one simply only needs to look at the draft hauls of the last 15 years of this club, and you can pretty much figure out when the transition took place. The marked improvement is readily noticeable.  I guess I really became so disenchanted with football in general the last few seasons, I didn't even notice the change in philosophy away from teams' seeing RB's as a valued commodity, and instead as being ""a dime a dozen"" in the new salary cap world. I guess I can KIND of understand the concept; given that workhorse RB's wear down awfully fast, and given that the league has gone heavy on the passing game of late, it makes sense not to want to go all in on a RB early in the draft.   But my god, have we gone so far down this road, that not only do we NOT place as much value on a top tier talent at this skill position any longer, we actually BEMOAN actually drafting for it?   From my untrained eye, I saw a number of games last year that hinged on one or two key plays that required a big play to be made in order to get the team over the hump. Situations where they needed just one big offensive play inside the 5 yard line in the red zone or something similar. No amount of role players and interior linemen were going to make the difference between winning and losing those big moments; a talented skill player taking ownership of that moment was what was needed - and this team simply didn't have it."
StLouisRams,34gvuv,txyesboy,8,Fri May 1 14:04:40 2015 UTC,"Fellow UGA fan here  Rams fan saying we didn't need him, we have Mason is like saying I don't need steak, I have a hot pocket. Maybe a little harsh but Gurley if he bounces back (which he will), he will be a top 5 RB in the league."
StLouisRams,34gvuv,dhuck20,4,Fri May 1 02:15:49 2015 UTC,"a good ass hot pocket , but i understand Gurley's potential is worth it"
StLouisRams,34gvuv,JiveTurkey92,0,Fri May 1 04:24:18 2015 UTC,"A steak which may give you food poisoning OR a cheeseburger. Gurley's injury is a huge IF and you're underrating Mason.   I don't really watch college football so I just trust the team did their homework and made the best picks. So I'm excited for Gurley, RBs in the first are always exciting. But I also understand everyone's confusion and hesitance"
StLouisRams,34gvuv,diesel321,21,Fri May 1 12:26:44 2015 UTC,"Dude once the dust settles, we'll be stoked.   Problem is we don't need an RB and some of us wanted something else. I personally wanted a big secondary pick or Flowers/Scherff, but that's okay.   I am so fucking stoked to be honest."
StLouisRams,34gvuv,FaulktheBlueRedbird,5,Fri May 1 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"I have decided to be excited about this. We have needed a true playmaker for a while. This next season will be the great experiment: Foles, Austin, and now Gurley."

StLouisRams,34gvuv,Wm_TheConqueror,2,Fri May 1 16:45:56 2015 UTC,"That's not the problem.  The problem is he has no one to run behind, and we already had Mason.  He could be great and I'll eat my words if that happens.  Just seems like a lot riskier than drafting a lineman or trading down"
StLouisRams,34gvuv,dlnvf6,3,Fri May 1 01:39:28 2015 UTC,I think he'll be an amazing RB and I'm still pissed about the pick. It made absolutely no sense with our other glaring needs.
StLouisRams,34gvuv,bwc_28,3,Fri May 1 01:40:22 2015 UTC,"That is my thought.  Honestly, it really is an exciting pick.  But come on?  Who is going to block for him?  Though I am trying to be calm and remember that Fisher / Snead always seem to have a plan during the draft and they always seem to make beneficial decisions.  I just don't see it with this pick."
StLouisRams,34gvuv,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Fri May 1 01:42:54 2015 UTC,"Initially, I was a bit stunned myself - but Gurley is a beast with world class speed and I'm starting to get pumped about this pick. With Shaerff and Flowers gone and Collins with his off-field issue, who would we have traded back for? Not Peat, they must be relying on Barksdale resigning at tackle and focusing on 2nd/3rd round for G/C. If we can do that, we may just have the OL to block for Gurley and be a true possession type team. Lock you down on D and run you over on O."
StLouisRams,34gvuv,dah00psta,1 point,Fri May 1 02:06:32 2015 UTC,I am calming down about it.  I will trust that Fisher and Snead have a plan.
StLouisRams,34gvuv,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Fri May 1 02:10:37 2015 UTC,No need to trade back Trae Waynes was right there in one of our biggest positions of need.
StLouisRams,34gvuv,bwc_28,1 point,Fri May 1 02:33:18 2015 UTC,"I was shocked too, but I've thought about it a bit. The OL we currently have has good run blockers. Also, I've always felt like offensive linemen are incredibly unpredictable, and solid offensive line men can be found in the later rounds of the draft. Also, the running back position is ruthless if you ask me. I think it's better for us because we'll utilize both Todd and Tre (Zac reportedly will be requesting a trade) so neither will get burnt out. Running backs have a short shelf life which I feel will be extended if we run two guys. That's just my 2 cents though."
StLouisRams,34gvuv,impossiber,2,Fri May 1 04:05:03 2015 UTC,Yeah that's kinda the same feeling I have

StLouisRams,34gvuv,bwc_28,5,Fri May 1 02:05:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the words, man!  Can't wait to see him on the field."
StLouisRams,34gvuv,daedalus000,3,Fri May 1 01:27:54 2015 UTC,"I think if we resign barksdale, draft a few linemen and I think our offense is solid. Foles Gurley/Mason, Quick, Britt, Cook, Austin and Bailey is not a bad  offense. If Foles can play consistently and we solidify our offensive line we should be a good team."
StLouisRams,34gvuv,MisQ,2,Fri May 1 01:35:20 2015 UTC,"I understand the skill set, but I don't understand the need, and I think the pick could have been made later on (and they could have traded down)."

Maybe a highly ranked O lineman or a db. They sort of made up for it with the following picks, but if this doesn't work out it'll be another mistake that our franchise just can't afford. I'm sick of us being sub .500. I hope gurley proves me wrong and proves all the idiot draft analysts right. My question is this. When are we going to sign a legit outside threat? How long before we decide it's time to find a wr who will consistently make big plays. A lot of other teams have one, why can't we? I get focusing on the run, I really do, but damn I just wish we weren't so one dimensional."
StLouisRams,34h5jn,styuR,4,Fri May 1 02:47:38 2015 UTC,No surprise. Hopefully we can get a pick out of him.
StLouisRams,34h5jn,edubs_stl,6,Fri May 1 02:53:58 2015 UTC,"Won't be able to get nearly as much now, should've traded him before the draft. Now everyone knows we're going to have to release him."
StLouisRams,34h5jn,bwc_28,2,Fri May 1 02:56:06 2015 UTC,"We don't have to release him. Teams often carry four running backs, if he doesn't like it retirement is an option... just ask Carson Palmer."

StLouisRams,34gzl9,BrawndoTTM,5,Fri May 1 02:26:07 2015 UTC,When your a power run team and the next Marshawn Lynch falls to you it makes perfect sense. Mason would never have been a top 5 talent in the NFL but Gurley can be.

If you're going to sit him for a year, great!  Otherwise, I hope he's 100% for camp and makes me eat my doubts this season but i think it will be unlikely.  In other words, he has a very high ceiling but who knows if he'll ever get back to his top level form"
StLouisRams,34gjlq,redditrediculous,6,Fri May 1 02:31:25 2015 UTC,"His knee is cleared. No lingering issues should be present.

StLouisRams,34gjlq,avanhokie,4,Fri May 1 01:15:27 2015 UTC,"This team has whiffed for the last decade on OL prospects and FAs (Barron, Smith, Long, Wells, etc.). We just spent yet another high 1st rounder on an OL last year. I for one am glad we've added a legitimately elite skill player rather than reaching for yet another OL. Criticize the RB decision all you want, and he clearly has injury concerns, but all the people clamoring for yet another no-impact lineman crack me up."
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,3,Fri May 1 04:54:48 2015 UTC,We have two proven very good RBs and a very good complementary RB. This was a retarded pick as good as Gurley might be. So dumb.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,avanhokie,10,Fri May 1 01:16:49 2015 UTC,Retarded pick? Really? It was the best player on the board bud.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,0,Fri May 1 02:01:01 2015 UTC,Who fit our lowest position of need. Trae Waynes would have made 100 times more sense. As would any of the other linemen taken in the first round.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,avanhokie,4,Fri May 1 02:03:06 2015 UTC,"Lowest position? Tre is good, Stacy is solid. It would be our lowest position of need if we had top quality there (Quinn, Donald)."
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,-1,Fri May 1 02:08:48 2015 UTC,"You don't need an elite RB to win nowadays. Look at the numerous Super Bowl victories the Vikings have in the last decade. Oh... Well at least the the Lions had all those Lombardi's with Barry Sanders. Or not. Having a very good one two tandem (which we have in either Stacy and Cunningham or Mason and Cunningham) is more than enough. We need a DT to replace Brockers who is probably gone after this season more than we need another RB. We need a DE to replace Long who is probably gone after this season more than we need another RB. So yeah, lowest position of need, or at least toward the bottom."
StLouisRams,34gjlq,avanhokie,3,Fri May 1 02:15:15 2015 UTC,Brockers is signed to a fifth year so he is here at least two more years (including this upcoming season).

StLouisRams,34gjlq,Ihateunerds,1 point,Fri May 1 02:41:46 2015 UTC,Even if we re-sign Barksdale we still need two more starters. We have no idea if Jones will ever play well in the league. So we have two huge holes to fill (including center) if we do in fact sign Barksdale.

StLouisRams,34gjlq,tamarockstar,1 point,Fri May 1 01:34:33 2015 UTC,I would be surprised if Stacy isn't swapped for a pick later.  Or even Mason if the return is good
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,0,Fri May 1 02:14:10 2015 UTC,For what? We missed out on the best CB in the draft for trade bait? I can't even right now.

StLouisRams,34gjlq,jts81,2,Fri May 1 01:16:17 2015 UTC,Why the fuck does everyone on this sub seen to think we're in desperate need of a cornerback? I wouldn't be surprised if we don't take a CB at ALL in this draft
StLouisRams,34gjlq,porkfish66,1 point,Fri May 1 01:31:02 2015 UTC,It's not a desperate need but there's room for an upgrade. And Jenkins may well move on next season.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,1 point,Fri May 1 01:33:05 2015 UTC,Because Jenkins sucks in coverage. Tru is up and down. Gaines was our only decent corner.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,MathBeaudet,3,Fri May 1 01:34:18 2015 UTC,"Jenkins was the victim of a lot of blown assignments by his teammates last year, even according to Fisher. But he is an extremely talented corner, yes he gambles to much sometimes, but......it's like you guys forgot the corners we used to have. Y'all have been spoiled by our improving defense. Jenkins, if he leaves next year, it's going to get MAD PAID by someone. He is a high quality corner"
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,1 point,Fri May 1 01:38:13 2015 UTC,"Jenkins blows plenty of coverages all on his own. Just because our old corners were worse, doesn't make him better."

StLouisRams,34gjlq,OnAComputer,1 point,Fri May 1 01:20:09 2015 UTC,It boggles my mind how many people here think you can't find interior linemen later in the draft. Obviously they know it's a need there just simply wasn't any OL on the board worth taking that high.  This was a BPA pick plain and simple. That's how good teams draft and I like it.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,frankoftank,1 point,Fri May 1 02:26:15 2015 UTC,So what are the chances we picked him to be traded? Either way I can live with the pick if they felt he was BPA.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,0,Fri May 1 01:18:44 2015 UTC,Kevin White's teeth like they were drawn by Jim Davis in a Garfield comic.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,jts81,0,Fri May 1 00:58:57 2015 UTC,Great pick... but question...  WHO THE FUCK IS BLOCKING FOR HIM?!  WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE DOING WITH TRE MASON AND STACY?!  WHY WOULD WE GET RID OF ONE ACL PROBLEM FOR ANOTHER?!  This was beyond dumb as shit
StLouisRams,34gjlq,mjbatt,3,Fri May 1 01:22:03 2015 UTC,His ACL checks out apparently. Gonna have to trust the docs.  Stacy was done after last year anyways. All I'm worried about is how we are going to utilize Tre Mason and Gurley.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,-4,Fri May 1 01:36:46 2015 UTC,"What the fuck are Fisher and Snead smoking??? That was the dumbest pick we could've possibly made. Wow. The best CB on the board which is our biggest position of need, multiple good linemen available. And instead they go with RB, the one fucking position we have tons of talent. What. The. Fuck."
StLouisRams,34gjlq,jts81,1 point,Fri May 1 01:15:57 2015 UTC,CB is in no way shape or form or biggest position of need
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,2,Fri May 1 01:18:01 2015 UTC,"It's arguably the biggest, CB and OL are 1a 1b imo. I would have put RB near the bottom"
StLouisRams,34gjlq,jts81,0,Fri May 1 01:22:17 2015 UTC,Name bigger needs other than o-line.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,1 point,Fri May 1 01:18:51 2015 UTC,"No,o line is the need yes, but you said CB"
StLouisRams,34gjlq,jts81,3,Fri May 1 01:19:52 2015 UTC,"It's debatable which is a bigger need, I think CB is barely a bigger need. But I could see it being o-line."
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bwc_28,1 point,Fri May 1 01:23:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's even close to debatable. Jenkins get a lot of unwarranted hate in this sub, and EJ Haines was one of the best cover corners in the league, by passes defended. LaMarcus Joyner missed most of the season hurt, and Trumaine Johnson is a serviceable 3. Meanwhile, we have 2 o lineman."
StLouisRams,34gjlq,jts81,0,Fri May 1 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"Jenkins gives up big plays every game. Johnson is average at best. Gaines was very good, but has only played one season. We have no proven good corners, none. I've been over this before in this sub, but it very much is debatable. Considering another user said the same thing to you that should say something."
StLouisRams,34gjlq,bleedblue89,1 point,Fri May 1 01:29:44 2015 UTC,Yeah.....I could not disagree more. But different people have different opinions

StLouisRams,34gjlq,avanhokie,0,Fri May 1 00:56:23 2015 UTC,Fucking Giants. I bet we go Parker.
StLouisRams,34gjlq,mjbatt,0,Fri May 1 01:00:02 2015 UTC,This seems like a really boneheaded pick...
StLouisRams,34h7fe,price-iz-right,2,Fri May 1 03:04:47 2015 UTC,"The comparison between Donald and Gurley is absurd. Donald never tore his ACL. 1/3 out of all athletes who tear their ACL end up tearing it again. And those that don't often never have the same speed as they did pre-injury.  That being said I think he'll recover and be ok, at least for a few seasons. But the fact is we have far bigger needs, and players like Waynes sitting there who fit those needs. I firmly believe he will be a great NFL player, but that doesn't change that it was a dumb pick. RBs alone can't make a team. Barry Sanders and Adrian Peterson have proved that. He has two starting offensive lineman to block for him and an unproven set of CBs on the other side of the line."
StLouisRams,34h7fe,bwc_28,9,Fri May 1 03:17:01 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with you. The new regime has had the best player on the board mentality. In 2012 we had the 2nd pick and got the RG3 trade. So with our 6th pick we traded back and got a second. So right here we have 3 second rounders, Jenkins, quick and pead with only Pead being a legit bust. At 14 that year we took the best player available Michael Brockers. Kids been a hole stuffing monster, arguably one of the most underrated d-linemen in the league. Next year we trade up and take Austin who was the best player on the board and after this year he'll be either a stud or a bust. Then we took Ogletree as the best player on the board and the kids been a phenomenal OLB. last year at 2 we took the Robinson who was the best player available and then Donald who was also the best player available and he has been the best DT in the NFL per pro player ranking.   Bottom line is this draft is high on talent but weak on Oline we took the best guy on OUR board and god damn if I don't believe in Snead"
StLouisRams,34h7fe,Areyoumyfriend,4,Fri May 1 04:51:55 2015 UTC,"We took a player recovering from one of the most devastating injuries in sports. An injury to the knee, which is the weak point of RBs. And we took that player despite him playing one of our deepest and strongest positions. And while doing so we looked over a player who was taken in the very next pick who filled one of our top two needs and is another top 10 talent.  What you're also ignoring is that every pick you mentioned was taken in years when we had an excess of picks. You have the luxury of picking best player available and reaching for players when you have multiple first round picks every season. We no longer have that luxury. And I use that word because it's exactly what Donald was referred to last season, a luxury pick. Something we no longer have. Teams like the Hawks and Pats can afford to go BPA every first round because they have deep rosters, something we do not have. We have glaring holes, that have not been addressed."
StLouisRams,34h7fe,bwc_28,2,Fri May 1 05:01:13 2015 UTC,"Alright, knowing what you know now about the talent that Adrian Peterson has, if you have the 6th pick in the 2007 draft do you take him?"
StLouisRams,34h7fe,Areyoumyfriend,1 point,Fri May 1 05:15:17 2015 UTC,"Different team and different situation, that's completely irrelevant."
StLouisRams,34h7fe,bwc_28,6,Fri May 1 05:22:22 2015 UTC,Answer the question
StLouisRams,34h7fe,Areyoumyfriend,2,Fri May 1 05:24:41 2015 UTC,"What's the point of answering a question completely unrelated to the subject at hand? In 2003 would you have taken Troy Polamalu over our actual pick of Jimmy Kennedy? Of course. We picked Adam Carriker in 2007, a first round bust. So you're asking if I would take a future HoFer instead of a bust. That's a ridiculous question that doesn't deserve any sort of response, even as much as I've already responded. Hell, Ahmad Bradshaw was one of the last picks in the 2007 draft and had a better career than Carriker. Hindsight makes everything easier."
StLouisRams,34h7fe,bwc_28,5,Fri May 1 05:32:43 2015 UTC,"So you would. Both AD and Gurley were injured College players who were elite prospects. Very similar, he's who we took be happy with him."
StLouisRams,34h7fe,Areyoumyfriend,0,Fri May 1 05:35:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, did you seriously just compare a broken collarbone to a torn ACL, for RBs? The position that relies on knees more than any other... That's the most disingenuous comparison I've seen in this sub."
StLouisRams,34h7fe,bwc_28,2,Fri May 1 05:38:18 2015 UTC,"AP popped both his ACLs and came back fine. Also had multiple injuries in college...yet no one is screaming ""injury prone""  Gurley was BPA. If we took an O lineman who flops and Gurley recovers and beasts it up we'd be calling for Snead's head and you know it.  Sometimes you have to roll the dice. Bradford didn't work out but that doesn't mean every damn player in the NFL should be dropped after AN injury. One injury and all of a sudden he's injury prone?  I'm more inclined to see how he works out this year.  Furthermore I agree, and you can check my history on this sub, that O line is our biggest weakness and the lynchpin to an effective offense. BUT wasting a 10 pick on a lacking OL class is ridiculous. You gotta take a stud and a play maker. We WILL draft run block oriented lineman for the next few picks. I also think Barksdale is coming back."
StLouisRams,34h7fe,Areyoumyfriend,3,Fri May 1 15:32:06 2015 UTC,"No, his sophomore year he broke his foot and had an ankle injury and his junior year he broke his collarbone. Missing nearly half the games you play in college makes you injury prone. Gurley tore his acl yes, but Drs say he is ahead of schedule and will be fine."

StLouisRams,34h86k,MacAnLuin,3,Fri May 1 03:39:47 2015 UTC,Or trade back into the second round and pick again.
StLouisRams,34h86k,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,6,Fri May 1 03:56:03 2015 UTC,lets get TJ Clemmings in the second and Collins in the 5th or 6th
StLouisRams,34h86k,vrock627,4,Fri May 1 03:54:32 2015 UTC,I thought he was off the board. Oh hell yeah then in that case. Maybe even trade up if we can do it relatively cheaply.

StLouisRams,34eoqx,Ezmoneh,6,Thu Apr 30 15:52:29 2015 UTC,Just because he's being sued for rape doesn't mean he did it. Its pretty clear at this point the girl is just going for a cash grab
StLouisRams,34eoqx,ManofTucson,-9,Thu Apr 30 16:03:42 2015 UTC,I don't come to this subreddit to listen to male chauvinists make apologies for rape.
StLouisRams,34eoqx,kersey79,5,Thu Apr 30 18:18:58 2015 UTC,"That's not at all what I'm doing. Rape is a terrible, terrible thing to put it lightly and I in no way have aplogies for it. But if you look into the situation, it's pretty clear she's been lying from the start and is just looking for a cash grab"
StLouisRams,34eoqx,ManofTucson,2,Thu Apr 30 22:47:13 2015 UTC,"The police cleared him. Rape is horrible, but I am not going to condemn someone who was not found guilty unless there is some very strong evidence(like Rice because I've seen the video)"
StLouisRams,34eoqx,Davidfreeze,2,Thu Apr 30 23:01:47 2015 UTC,I heard on Mike and Mike this morning that certain teams are quietly saying that he won't get drafted AT ALL.

StLouisRams,34eoqx,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:26:05 2015 UTC,I think his stock has gone down because he has yet to meet with the police. If he is cleared and all that I say go after a play maker and then get this guy.
StLouisRams,34eoqx,autiger8l5,2,Thu Apr 30 16:45:26 2015 UTC,"I can honestly see him dropping much further than the 2nd round. I don't necessarily agree with it, but I can kind of understand it."
StLouisRams,34eoqx,CallOnTyrone,2,Thu Apr 30 19:24:01 2015 UTC,Might have to be a 4th and a 5th because Miami gave up their 3rd already and they wouldn't give up their 2nd unless they're seriously lacking brain power.
StLouisRams,34eoqx,DesignatedDecoy,5,Thu Apr 30 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want a 4th or 5th. If you go by the draft value chart (http://walterfootball.com/draftchart.php) a 10th pick in the first is 1,300 points while the 14th is 1,100. This means that to approximate the value of a trade down, Miami would have to kick in at least a mid round third. Since they don't have that the Rams would either have to settle for a 4th (losing ~100 points of value) or Miami would have to cough up their 2nd gifting the rams an additional 200 of value. You might see something like the Rams and Miami swapping with Miami giving their 3rd next year and this year's 5th. That kinda splits the difference between the two teams.  I guess if the Rams only have one guy in that range and are positive that he'll be there at 14 they should take whatever they can but I'd rather not trade back just for the sake of trading back if the pick you get is on day 3."
StLouisRams,34eoqx,jts81,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:05:21 2015 UTC,Great job at breaking down the situation if this was to go down. I'm putting my faith in the Rams to do the right thing for the team in which I think they will. Honestly I would only trade back if we get a really great deal if not im sure someone good will be at 10.

StLouisRams,34f995,New_DudeToo,9,Thu Apr 30 17:34:45 2015 UTC,"Yes. I can see it now. Fisher's grand scheme.   Rams trade away the #13 and next year's first rounder. We grab Leonard Williams.   Then the Rams throw in Nick Foles and Kenny Britt to the Browns for #12. They grab Shane Ray.   Despite the Rams offense averaging a mere 6 points a game the entire year, they go 10-6 averaging 16.5 sacks a game. No QB's in the post-season last pats the second half, and the Rams win the SB."

StLouisRams,34dwft,Bmallar1,7,Thu Apr 30 10:42:19 2015 UTC,We get the second next year no matter what. We can potentially send a conditional pick back to them if Bradford gets hurt or plays fewer than 50% of the Eagles' snaps (a third or a fourth respectively.)        I seem to recall seeing somewhere that we're off the hook for the conditional pick if the Eagles trade Sam again.

StLouisRams,34dwft,big_fig,2,Thu Apr 30 14:27:03 2015 UTC,the only conditional pick possible in that trade is a 3rd or 4th.  Depending on if Bradford misses time or is injured.

StLouisRams,34akaq,Ihateunerds,-1,Wed Apr 29 17:25:09 2015 UTC,"If he used vague terms to say that they had no plans on trading him, I'd say it meant nothing. He said there was no chance of Brockers being traded. There's a huge difference."

StLouisRams,34bhw0,Maverick814,6,Wed Apr 29 21:11:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trade up, but if he's there at 10 I'm all in.  I just don't think he falls to 10, even if he makes it past the Giants someone will trade up at a much cheaper rate than trading up to #2.  I hope one of Cooper/White falls to 10, select them.  If I were to bet money Id say we will NOT be picking at 10, somewhere lower."
StLouisRams,34bhw0,ITameFatGirls,3,Wed Apr 29 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trade up for him.  We would likely lose a couple early round picks for him and it will make it harder to address the offensive line issues.  What is the use of having Mariota if we can't patch up our line and we let him get murdered? I know he is athletic and can move around the pocket quite a bit, but keep in mind he would be trying to learn a brand new system at a whole new level of talent.  On top of that, I think we have a need at receiver, but I don't think it can be successfully addressed in this draft outside of Amari Cooper or Kevin White.  Obviously our corps could be improved from last year and make this less of an issue, but our receivers have shown they have a difficult time getting open.  This is going to allow for coverage sacks.  If we could grab Cooper or White, I feel like we would have a true #1 that could open the receivers up a bit more down the field.  Third, I believe in Nick Foles.  Is he going to have a season as good as 2013-2014?  Probably not, but he doesn't need to.  He needs to play consistently, and he has shown he can do that.  Nick Foles will never be a Tom Brady, but he has shown he knows what it takes to win.  Unless we can find a way to grab Mariota without sacrificing our ability to patch up our offensive line, I don't think it is an intelligent decision.  It is a fun and exciting decision, just not the right one in my opinion."
StLouisRams,34bhw0,One_Half_Hamster,4,Wed Apr 29 21:12:05 2015 UTC,"I think he's a player worth trading up for if we DIDN'T have Foles. We need other positions filled too badly to trade up. We should just take BPA at 10 (Cooper, White, Scherff) or just trade down."
StLouisRams,34bhw0,Thonked,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"Just got done watching the pre-draft press conference. It appears they feel the same way, and they really like foles."
StLouisRams,34bhw0,FaulktheBlueRedbird,3,Thu Apr 30 07:27:17 2015 UTC,"I would not.  I believe in Foles because I think the front office believes in Foles. Have we forgotten how much Fisher really supported Bradford? He loved the guy and really wanted him around, even with injuries. I really think a healthy Bradford is a borderline elite quarterback, and I think Fisher believed that. The trade wasn't made lightly.   I think it was a big deal letting him go. I think Fisher and Snead saw something in Foles that was worth giving up Bradford for. They saw something in Foles that they believe will add to the long term success of this team. Everyone wants to talk about how he'll never be in 2013 form again. But come on... that kind of season does not happen by accident. That was one of the greatest seasons in NFL QB history.   I think they plan to focus on what made him successful in 2013 and put him on a path towards success. He's a big, accurate passer who will more than likely stay healthy. I think the front office will build around Foles very seriously. Trading up for Mariota, or passing up on an important piece at #10 doesn't' make sense to me."
StLouisRams,34bhw0,bwc_28,2,Thu Apr 30 00:07:39 2015 UTC,I would rather take Hundley in the second round. He has the same weaknesses but won't cost nearly as much. Mariota is far too much of a risk to trade up for. Oregon has a long history of successful college QBs who couldn't step up in the NFL. Even if he's there at ten I wouldn't take him.
StLouisRams,34bhw0,mcthsn,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:02:08 2015 UTC,"After watching the pre-draft press conference i suspect they will take hundley in the second or petty in the third, snead said he belives the ""other"" QBs in the draft will prove everyone wrong."

StLouisRams,347snk,Jewmangi,8,Wed Apr 29 00:02:48 2015 UTC,"Something tells me he overestimated his market value after the Rams made him a fair but team-friendly offer, so now the Rams are offering slightly less money than he's being offered elsewhere and he's been debating whether to take the discount and stay where he is or follow slightly more money for a major change of scenery."
StLouisRams,347snk,Zoloir,2,Wed Apr 29 00:48:56 2015 UTC,"Awww man, after hearing him on the rams addiction podcast i hope he stays :(  Really sounded like a good dude."
StLouisRams,347snk,Wm_TheConqueror,2,Wed Apr 29 16:03:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we definitely need to get this done, he's solid as they come.

StLouisRams,347snk,Wm_TheConqueror,8,Wed Apr 29 00:16:58 2015 UTC,"Scherff next to Barksdale sounds good to me. We would be able to retain 4 OL positions for several years. So if Robinson and potentially Scherff pan out, that would give us the best OL the Rams have had in a decade, including whoever they put in at C. And maybe Barrett Jones is ready, or we draft a C who is good mid-round."
StLouisRams,347snk,ClitorisNigga,3,Wed Apr 29 00:23:13 2015 UTC,"I definitely like that scenario. Picking O-lineman in the first round several times, while not flashy, works out a lot of the time. It would especially be advantageous for the Rams since Fisher has a run oriented offense."

StLouisRams,34c2wi,Vanscoten,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"i agree. thats why i was saying pick teddy instead of robinson, and if i was given the chance, i would do it."
StLouisRams,34c2wi,vrock627,2,Thu Apr 30 02:50:37 2015 UTC,"I think Greg is going to be pretty good for us, but maybe that's just me."
StLouisRams,34c2wi,Vanscoten,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:54:09 2015 UTC,"me too, but a QB is more valuable than an O-lineman, especially since g-rob aint a sure thing yet"
StLouisRams,34c2wi,vrock627,0,Thu Apr 30 04:08:07 2015 UTC,But clearly they did.
StLouisRams,34c2wi,FaulktheBlueRedbird,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:56:44 2015 UTC,well yes thats why they didnt pick him. key word is hypothetically
StLouisRams,34c2wi,vrock627,0,Thu Apr 30 04:07:25 2015 UTC,Right... but they did. Hypothetically we could have played the draft 100 different ways last off-season. But we didn't.
StLouisRams,34c2wi,FaulktheBlueRedbird,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:15:46 2015 UTC,i was just answering the question you dont gotta be a dick about it
StLouisRams,34c2wi,vrock627,-3,Thu Apr 30 04:42:21 2015 UTC,"I think Teddy has shown he a franchise QB or at least a solid starter for 10 years.  I agree that at his position Donald is better than Teddy and probably will end up better, but lets not pretend a DT is as valuable as QB.  The Rams have had a good dline for a few years and we have achieved mediocrity at best. With a good QB, I think the Rams are a good team."
StLouisRams,34c2wi,To3z,5,Thu Apr 30 00:20:39 2015 UTC,"Wtf are you smoking? There's a reason why the league fears our defense, and Donald is a key component. Mediocre my ass."
StLouisRams,34c2wi,FaulktheBlueRedbird,0,Thu Apr 30 03:32:07 2015 UTC,I mean our best year as a team in a while is 8-8. I agree that our front 7 is elite and honestly I think everything outside of our offense is elite.
StLouisRams,34c2wi,xKeyNin,3,Thu Apr 30 04:02:55 2015 UTC,We didn't go 8-8 this past year.
StLouisRams,34c2wi,vrock627,5,Thu Apr 30 05:47:06 2015 UTC,"It may only be his first year but Donald was the best defensive tackle in football last year. As a rookie.  Teddy, while good, in my opinion doesn't seem like he will ever take the steps to become and elite quarterback. I see him hovering around the league average to slightly above average.  Donald has potential to be a perennial all-pro/pro bowler.  So you're asking for us to choose between one of the best, if not the best defensive tackle in the NFL, or an average QB.  Donald without hesitation."
StLouisRams,34c2wi,4Signs,2,Thu Apr 30 02:52:52 2015 UTC,what if we took teddy instead of robinson?
StLouisRams,34c2wi,eaglex47,2,Wed Apr 29 23:32:17 2015 UTC,"I think Donald is better than Robinson thats why I put him. Honestly, Donald played so well I forgot he wasn't our first pick"
StLouisRams,347siy,superspamtastic,14,Tue Apr 28 23:54:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think I like this. Brockers is a solid run blocker, and I don't think losing him would be worth moving up 3 spots. Like the tweet said, it could also be pre draft smoke."
StLouisRams,347siy,Wm_TheConqueror,3,Wed Apr 29 00:00:31 2015 UTC,"The only way I see this happening is if the player Fisher and Snead want is there at 7. It would only happen Thursday, if at all."
StLouisRams,347siy,The49ersBlow,-1,Wed Apr 29 00:06:21 2015 UTC,Is Jameis Winston Fisher's Steve McNair? comes to mind
StLouisRams,347siy,tokeyoh,3,Wed Apr 29 15:13:04 2015 UTC,"It really depends. If we sit at 10, we likely miss out on Scherff and Cooper/White. PFF actually had Fairley as the 14th ranked DT in the league last year for run stop percentage. I can't find Brockers, but I think Fairley could fill in fine for him in the run and a player, who has really only achieved enough to be considered average, is worth a move to grab a possible blue chip player without losing picks."
StLouisRams,347siy,The_Wayward,7,Wed Apr 29 14:11:28 2015 UTC,No me gusta.      Not unless we're getting a whole lot more than moving-up-three-spots of value for it. That's equivalent to a third round pick. Brockers is certainly worth more than that.       Maybe a smokescreen?
StLouisRams,347siy,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,3,Wed Apr 29 00:34:00 2015 UTC,Remember this time last year there was a ton of manziel hype to the rams.

StLouisRams,347siy,The49ersBlow,5,Wed Apr 29 17:06:03 2015 UTC,"I would welcome this. Brockers is solid, but not spectacular. Fairley could be amazing next to Donald. And that could get us Cooper, who I personally covet. I have been waiting for the Rams to draft a playmaker top talent WR for years.   I wouldn't be upset with a OL, but I don't feel like there is a player worth passing up Cooper for."
StLouisRams,347siy,Wm_TheConqueror,10,Wed Apr 29 00:00:46 2015 UTC,"Nick Fairley has the potential to be great, but I'm worrisome about getting rid of a solid player for a guy who has had problems staying on the field for weight issues."
StLouisRams,347siy,The49ersBlow,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:11:01 2015 UTC,"I have the same concerns. But if he has a good season this year, we can sign him long term on a discount because of his past issues. So we would probably be able to sign Fairley and Brockers to similar long term contract values, with Fairley obviously having more risk involved."
StLouisRams,347siy,ThirdTimesAnAlt,5,Wed Apr 29 00:15:28 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Brockers is the run-stuffer on our d-line, and he's great at it. I don't think Fairly would have the same constant drive to do what Brockers does every series."
StLouisRams,347siy,bozo7337,2,Wed Apr 29 00:24:32 2015 UTC,Fairley plays the same role in a 4-3 as Donald. Neither of them can do what Brockers does and losing him would hurt our DLine a lot. He clogs the middle and is huge against the run. Fairley will though be next to Donald just on obvious passing downs.
StLouisRams,347siy,Sinisterminister77,2,Wed Apr 29 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"If it gets us Cooper, I agree. I just don't see Cooper lasting until 7 even..."
StLouisRams,347siy,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,2,Wed Apr 29 15:47:10 2015 UTC,"You are happy with getting rid of an ""is"" for a ""could""? Brockers is great at his job you need to get over looking at just numbers. If this trade happened I would be very sad :("
StLouisRams,347siy,The49ersBlow,2,Wed Apr 29 01:12:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Brockers is great. He is an above average DT who excels at run support. Fairley is an above average DT who excels at pass rushing. I see more potential with Fairley than with Brockers.   But, regardless, I will still support whoever ends up playing for the Rams."
StLouisRams,347siy,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"You again are only thinking about sacks. We have stepped up greatly in recent years against the run game. Brock's job is to plug the line and stop the run. Take up two defenders so that donald, quinn, and long are in 1v1's. He's more than stats."
StLouisRams,347siy,The49ersBlow,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not thinking about just sacks. I'm thinking about what I have watched while watching every game since Brockers was drafted. I haven't seen every game Fairley has played in, but I have seen a handful. I see more potential to be a well rounded DLman from Fairley than from Brockers."
StLouisRams,347siy,Ihateunerds,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:49:25 2015 UTC,I agree it would make a lot of sense if Cooper is still on the board at 7. Trading Brockers could free up the cap space to re-sign Barksdale.
StLouisRams,347siy,ImTheBestMayne,2,Wed Apr 29 14:49:12 2015 UTC,Why would we pick up his 5th year option and then trade him?
StLouisRams,347siy,ThomJonson,4,Wed Apr 29 01:11:07 2015 UTC,"We just recently passed the deadline to exercise the 5th year option. Should they want to trade brockers, you're not going to get as much capital for a player with one season left on his contract as you would for a player with two.   Should they be looking to trade him on draft night (post deadline) you essentially have a significantly more attractive asset at the cost of nothing"

StLouisRams,347siy,wohldmad,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:55:39 2015 UTC,We are stacked at D Line and people seem to forget if Brockers gets breathed on heavily his ass is on the turf injured. 3 spots seems like a steep price but if they can get Cooper there I wouldn't be upset.
StLouisRams,347siy,Bskrilla,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"people seem to forget if Brockers gets breathed on heavily his ass is on the turf injured   What? He's missed 3 regular season games in 3 years, and they were all from the high-ankle sprain his rookie year where he got rolled on by an O-lineman."
StLouisRams,347siy,wohldmad,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:35:30 2015 UTC,"Only three games, but how many snaps has he missed? I've been to every home game since he's been a ram and have numerous memories of him writhing in pain on the turf and not completing the game only to be active next game. Soft."
StLouisRams,347siy,Bskrilla,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:08:48 2015 UTC,He's played over half of the team's defensive  snaps in every year he's been in the league. His rookie year he was hurt the first 3 games from a preseason fluke injury which hurt his snap count and he was a rookie. He still played 600 snaps.  His second year he ranked 37th in total snap played among ALL defensive lineman. Last year he ranked 66th among all defensive lineman in a rotation with Donald and Langford.  He also did basically miss 1 game in 2014. Logging no snaps in the SF game in week 5 which hurt his season total.  So in 3 years he's missed 4 games and logged what appears to be average to above average snap counts for a DT.    I really can't recall/find all these times he got sneezed on and missed a bunch of snaps.
StLouisRams,347siy,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:33:03 2015 UTC,"I'm OK with trading Brockers, but we better get more than just moving up 3 spots. Throw in the Bears second rounder or Kyle Long and this would be a great deal."

StLouisRams,34313x,BilllyMayes,29,Mon Apr 27 22:25:13 2015 UTC,We have a serious need to replace a line that lets more men through multiple holes than Sasha Gray.    10/10
StLouisRams,34313x,BrawndoTTM,2,Mon Apr 27 22:49:54 2015 UTC,Gray   0/10
StLouisRams,34313x,BallsDeepInJesus,3,Tue Apr 28 14:31:31 2015 UTC,Cooper well be give at 10 no doubt   1/10
StLouisRams,34313x,Zoloir,12,Tue Apr 28 19:59:35 2015 UTC,"The building up of the oline can be accomplished without spending our first on it. I'm convinced Barksdale gets resigned right after the draft. That leaves the two weak spots on the line to address. Fisher has three guys on the roster that he apparently has confidence in that can play center in Barnes, Jones and Rhaney. That leaves our biggest hole on the line from last year to address. It just so happens that this draft has two guys who could come in and start day one that are second round grade RG in Laken Tomlinson and AJ Cann. If we spens another pick or two on depth we should be in good shape and be able to add a playmaker at WR which we also could really use.  I'm not saying I prefer a WR over OLine in the first but if we pass on oline in the first the sky won't be falling. My scenario depends on Barksdale resigning and the on roster stepping up. Personally I like Rhaney at center a lot."
StLouisRams,34313x,bozo7337,3,Mon Apr 27 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"I was vehemently against taking White or Cooper at 10, but you gave a solid argument for that exact scenario, I definitely wouldn't be against it. If it indeed happened."
StLouisRams,34313x,Wm_TheConqueror,5,Tue Apr 28 00:57:20 2015 UTC,"It's BPA boss. If the top player available on the board is a WR and we don't have any offers that are worth trading back I'm cool with taking a Cooper or White if they're available.  I'll be the first to admit I hated the A. Donald pick. My first thought was ""Another D-Lineman?!"" It wasn't a need yet we ended up the DROY. There's no need to reach at a position for a need.   Though I understand the need for an O Line, consider we do take Cooper or White. With Britt, Bailey, Austin, and assuming Quick returns to what he was before he got hurt last year, we may have a stacked WR core.   Besides, we have our 2nd and 3rd and other picks we can use on OL."
StLouisRams,34313x,NotAGynecologist,0,Mon Apr 27 22:58:31 2015 UTC,"BPA is fine, and Donald was an odd pick for sure at the time. I just think our oline is a bit to weak right now."
StLouisRams,34313x,One_Half_Hamster,3,Mon Apr 27 23:18:07 2015 UTC,"If White or Cooper are still on the board, I would personally take them.  The O-line is our biggest need, I agree, but its actually a pretty good draft class at line, whereas White and Cooper are the two true standout WR.  Every other WR in this draft will likely end up being a project receiver.  White or Cooper could also give us a true number one receiver which would mean less ""coverage sacks.""  That being said, I like our receiving corps for the most part and won't be disappointed at all if we don't find any other receivers in the draft."
StLouisRams,34313x,ItsBiggy,3,Tue Apr 28 00:10:06 2015 UTC,"If Cooper or White are there at 10 with Scherff gone, we have to take them."
StLouisRams,34313x,MengTheBarbarian,2,Tue Apr 28 01:53:19 2015 UTC,I'd much rather take Cooper and White over Andrus Peat. Guy is a 2nd rounder at best.
StLouisRams,34313x,The_Wayward,1 point,Tue Apr 28 08:01:39 2015 UTC,I think Peat would make an excellent RT. I just hope we get Barksdale figured out and don't need one of those.
StLouisRams,34313x,tjb_32,3,Tue Apr 28 14:08:44 2015 UTC,"I have no idea either and given Fisher's comments on the receiving corps it doesn't even seem that likely. I honestly don't think our receivers are that bad. We got Britt back, we'll have a healthy Quick who showed he can be a no.1, and Tavon really has nowhere to go but up. We have tons of other needs to be too concerned about a WR in the first. O-line, CB, and even OLB are all more pressing needs imo."
StLouisRams,34313x,grizwald85,2,Mon Apr 27 23:10:56 2015 UTC,Upvote for using a Sasha Grey reference in a football rant
StLouisRams,34313x,hlainelarkinmk2,2,Tue Apr 28 00:22:20 2015 UTC,The WR is Ok at Best.    That's a pretty bold and incorrect statement there buddy. While you are right O line picks aren't that sexy but Scherff aside there's none in this draft class worth taking at #10 that's why not many people are predicting it
StLouisRams,34313x,Sauceman87,2,Tue Apr 28 00:43:08 2015 UTC,"While we need to fix our OL more than anything, this draft simply does not offer value where we sit. At this time, really only Scherff provides value at our pick - all other picks are late first round picks or beyond.  If Scherff is there, he's 100% my pick. That being said, if he's gone, we'll likely trade down, but going after a true #1 WR if he's available isn't a horrible play. It gives us, hopefully, the true #1 we don't have, and then we can start working on the OL in round 2 through 4, which has alot more value for the OL.  That being said, if we're truely looking for a WR, I see some day 2 prospects that look really good."
StLouisRams,34313x,SoulardSTL,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:02:35 2015 UTC,"I really hope all the talk about WR is misdirection from the team. Let them talk receiver, then pick up some guys to fill out the right side line. We now have a solid QB in Nick Foles; let's make sure his brain doesn't become scrambled eggs like Bradford's. We may find out that we have some quality at WR already."

StLouisRams,34313x,Ihateunerds,-1,Tue Apr 28 00:03:14 2015 UTC,"While I agree, it's just that our oline is so damn weak. If the oline available is top 6 on the board available, we should pick them up. Especially a center."
StLouisRams,34313x,porkfish66,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:09:33 2015 UTC,You want to draft a center at ten overall? Or am I just misunderstanding your drivel?
StLouisRams,34313x,PapiYogi,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, we absolutely need line help, especially in the middle. But with #10 overall? If we needed a LT, sure, but we filled that hole last year (we hope.) Do we really want to take a guard or center at 10? Personally I'm hoping we bring Barksdale back so it isn't an issue, but still, 10 isn't where you get value on a right tackle either.  I'd love to see us trade out of this spot if there's a good offer on the table, so we have more picks to spend on linemen in the middle rounds. But if that offer isn't there, it's a BPA situation weighted towards offense. And that best player may well be a receiver."
StLouisRams,342dr2,ThirdTimesAnAlt,4,Mon Apr 27 19:37:52 2015 UTC,Smart move on Brockers and probably not exercising Barron as well.
StLouisRams,342dr2,bozo7337,5,Mon Apr 27 19:48:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Brockers has settled into a good role, one that helps the team so damn much, and he's damn good at it. Really glad to see his option get picked up.  Barron, if he does well this year in the Big Nickle packages, then I'd be on board with bringing him back. If not, then there's no money lost."
StLouisRams,342dr2,The_Wayward,3,Mon Apr 27 19:54:16 2015 UTC,"Since Barron was the 7th overall in the draft, his option would have cost over $8 million to pick up. I hope we keep him around after this year to play that role, but definitely agree its best we don't pick up that option."

StLouisRams,342dr2,bozo7337,2,Mon Apr 27 19:40:41 2015 UTC,"And the article, in case you don't want to do the survey question to read it:  ""In what should rate as a case of doing the expected, the Rams have decided to exercise the fifth-year option on defensive tackle Michael Brockers for the 2016 season.  The Rams faced a league-wide deadline of May 3, the day after this year's draft, to exercise the option on Brockers, who otherwise would've been scheduled for unrestricted free agent after the 2015 season _ the fourth year of his original contract as a rookie out of Louisiana State.  The fifth-year option concept was instituted as part of the 2011 collective bargaining agreement. Last year, the Rams exercised their fifth-year option on defensive end Robert Quinn, subsequently signing him to a contract extension last September before the Rams' Week 2 contest at Tampa Bay.  Quinn was selected 14th overall in the 2011 draft. This year, it's the 2012 first-round class that's subject to the fifth-year option, and Brockers was selected 14th overall that year.  With the Rams' exercising the option, Brockers is scheduled to make $6.146 million in 2016. That's the average of the third_ through 25th-highest paid defensive tackles in the NFL. Which is the formula used for fifth-year options on players drafted from No. 11 overall to No. 32 in the opening round.  Brockers, 24, registered 73 tackles and two sacks last season, a little off his career highs of 75 tackles and 5 1/2 sacks in 2013. But with the emergence of rookie Aaron Donald, Brockers did more of the dirty work on the Rams' defensive front in 2014, frequently playing almost in a nose tackle-type role over the second half of the season."""

Plus we gave up 2 fairly valuable mid-round picks for him just last season. Shouldn't we at least give him a chance before cutting him loose?
StLouisRams,342dr2,The_Wayward,3,Mon Apr 27 21:16:33 2015 UTC,No he hasn't but prior to joining us he had 2 sacks in 2.5 years at TB and only I think 3 Int. He hasn't put up huge numbers but he did have 3 sacks in 1/2 a season for us. It's very likely after this year we can get him back for less than this 5th year option would have cost.

StLouisRams,33ztd3,LarryCsonkasStache,3,Mon Apr 27 04:47:04 2015 UTC,"While he did restructure, he just converted his salary to a signing bonus and didn't lose any money on the deal.  I think if we offer him a competitive salary he might re-sign, but if somebody else is willing to overpay him than I don't see him turning that down, as much as I hate the thought of him leaving and us drafting another DE in the 1st round this year."
StLouisRams,33ztd3,The49ersBlow,6,Mon Apr 27 15:00:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if he can stay healthy, he could have a big season. It will be his first full season under Gregg Williams.

Hell of a player thats managed respectable numbers from the Left side for years. When he was out for injury this past year, the whole D-line struggled without his presence. I think it would take at least an early second round player to fill his shoes on our line, but I'd prefer to see him stay long term and move on from JL55. A promising young MLB would be much better for our D than moving on from Long and taking another young D-lineman."

StLouisRams,33yxzs,AsaKurai,5,Mon Apr 27 01:48:38 2015 UTC,"I think we all can empathize with the Chargers fans in San Diego. STL lost the Football Cardinals in 1988. LA lost the Rams and Raiders in 1995. No one wants to see home teams leave their markets, but it's a fight for a limited commodity: franchises. Relocation sucks all around. The League really should have expanded to 36 teams, with 2 franchises designated for LA. But, it's too late to happen now, and San Diego appears first to lose their team.   The article itself looks viable in its assessment of the finances. I've recently seen an interview with Chargers attorney Mark Fabiani where he makes the case for relocation being an economic necessity and strictly business. Considering there are no plans for the site, and no identified funding in hand, it's quite reasonable the Chargers will be in Los Angeles in the near future.   Ditto the Raiders, where things have regressed to the point where Floyd Kephart, the man behind the Coliseum City concept, was last week taking public jabs at Eric Grubman and the NFL. Hard to have faith when Oakland's hurling insults at the League, and it's not even a Davis doing it this time. If both teams are unable to stay in their home markets, then they'll both go in on Carson and be the 2-team solution to see that site developed.   Looking ahead, it really looks like LA will be the new home to both the Chargers and the Raiders by 2016. It also looks like STL will keep the Rams, and with State funding settled will be doing so in a new stadium. Momentum is really moving in this direction. Of course, there remain many questions, and this is far from settled."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,SoulardSTL,6,Mon Apr 27 18:17:22 2015 UTC,"According to this Carson probably isn't as far along as it is generally perceived.   Pats owner Robert Kraft said that the NFL has an obligation to stay in St. Louis, with a financing package, but doesn't necessarily mean that's the Rams.  Things can change, but I really think that if the NFL is playing in St. Louis, that team won't be owned by Stan Kroenke. The dude seems to be headed to LA no matter what."

Nothing can be certain, but I cannot imagine the NFL risking setting the precedent of a city putting together a stadium proposal and budget plan with a ready-to-build stadium and secured funding and the NFL taking their team away. I also think the owners (the only ones with any real power, let's be honest) wouldn't want that either. It would destroy their ability to bargain with cities."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,bigDean636,3,Mon Apr 27 03:19:11 2015 UTC,"The league is yet to make that promise to St. Louis, though. If it were that simple they would say ""if you build it the Rams will stay"" not the NFL as a whole.  Locally, the perception is that the folks in Carson have a lot of questions yet to answer. Their plan is a direct response to Kroenke, and they are way behind besides both sites being entitled. The whole process has been driven by Kroenke thus far, and I just have trouble seeing him not finish what he started."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,Seductive_Santa,3,Mon Apr 27 04:16:37 2015 UTC,"I do believe Kroenke will have some presence in LA. Whether that's a team he owns or a stadium he rents, who knows.

StLouisRams,33yxzs,bigDean636,2,Mon Apr 27 04:28:18 2015 UTC,"The precedent the league has long set is that the billionaire owners make tons of money. The Rams are worth more to every owner in LA than in STL. And Kroenke will get permission to move before the STL stadium is all approved and ready. Nixon thinks he an fast track this through the approval process, but it's not gonna work out. And, what if these lawsuits demanding a public vote succeed? Or what if they fail at the district level but then the MO Supreme Court overturns them and freezes money until a public vote? Then the league alienates a city for a second time with no clear exit strategy.   If they do actually line up the funding and approve the stadium, the Raiders look like a very realistic possibility."

What bond?   Do you mean the relocation bylaws or some nebulous moral responsibility that the NFL supposedly has?  If you mean the bylaws, and some have suggested that the city of St. Louis would sue the NFL for violating their own bylaws, the NFL's solution is simple.  Here's how the meeting would go:  Goodell:  ""We have a problem.  The city of St. Louis is threatening to sue us for violating our relocation bylaws if we allow Kroenke to move the Rams.""  Every Owner, in unison:  ""Then let's change the bylaws.""  Goodell:  ""Ok, done.  Next on the agenda is...""  I really don't understand why people think the bylaws are so binding."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,DeniseDeNephew,2,Mon Apr 27 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"Every Owner, in unison: ""Then let's change the bylaws.""   Which wouldn't take affect until a resolution would be needed and the lawsuit filed. Lets not kid ourselves that we have any idea how this would actually play out."

They're only guaranteeing that they remain an nfl market IMO."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,Seductive_Santa,-2,Mon Apr 27 18:49:47 2015 UTC,"the NFL will not abandon a city that builds a stadium for its team   The St. Louis TASK FORCE is not building a stadium unless Kroenke wants them to.  Don't listen to Peacock's vague promises, look at the facts.  Peacock said the land for the stadium was ""mostly arranged and purchased"" but the truth is that no land has been purchased.  Instead the TASK FORCE has written letters of intent to buy land.  That's progress of some kind, but it isn't the type of progress that the TASK FORCE would have us believe.    They don't have private investors but instead gathered signatures on a letter to the NFL from local businesses to express their interest in ""seats and suites"".  Again, that's something but it's not as much as some would have you think.    Can the Governor extend the bonds for another $350 million without a vote because the original bonds were approved 20 years ago?   Talk about setting a precedent!   Even if the people in St. Louis who promised to challenge this in court backed out I think someone somewhere else would.  If the Governor of Missouri can do this then how many other Governors can?   You approved bonds for Project A two decades ago so we can extend those bonds forever, for any amount of money, even for a different project!   Is there anyone anywhere who thinks a Governor or state legislature should have this kind of power?  Why not go all the way and extend the bonds for 3 billion and then the city can build a new stadium and buy the team?  (I know the city can't buy the team, just pointing out how ridiculous the bond extension is)  Some voters may buy into the idea that the new stadium will revitalize the city but others will look at the area around the EJD and see the lie for what it is."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,DeniseDeNephew,3,Mon Apr 27 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"The NFL is playing every single angle here. They want STL to come up with a stadium proposal so they have that option. However, the NFL wants back in LA. And Kroenke has the first realistic plan since the league left in 1994. And as far as other owners, there is going to be a relocation fee to move to LA. I've read that it could be as high as $500 mil. Even $250 mil will give owners a little under $10 mil each, and the shared revenue from an LA team would dwarf that of STL any day.   Kroenke is going to move the team. And he will sue the league if he doesn't get permission. Al Davis did it successfully back in the day. And the owners don't want a court to decide this. That move will vault the Rams up from one of the last teams in franchise value to one of the top teams. If the Clippers can sell for $2 bil, any NFL team will be worth more than that. Even the Raiders. My guess is that we share a stadium with the Chargers and the Raiders move elsewhere, be it San Antonio or St. Louis."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,The49ersBlow,5,Mon Apr 27 07:53:00 2015 UTC,"They didn't have the relocation guide lines when Davis moved.  I'm not a lawyer, but I believe the guide lines make it much more difficult to sue the league."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,Dave_the_lighting_gu,2,Mon Apr 27 14:27:32 2015 UTC,"The guidelines aren't the issue here. It's the NFL's antitrust exemption. The league cannot tell individual businesses where they can operate. That's what came from the Davis case and that's what is still relevant. You let a judge decide this case, it begins to strip power from owners."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,The49ersBlow,3,Mon Apr 27 21:46:06 2015 UTC,"The owners vote on it. The nfl only gets to give input prior to the vote. It is a very detailed process, with very detailed criteria."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,Dave_the_lighting_gu,2,Mon Apr 27 23:55:47 2015 UTC,"There's a reason they want to move up the relocation deadline. Kroenke digs the first week of December regardless of what the league or anyone else says. The league wants to appear as though they're in control, approving him before hand and avoiding the media storm that comes with Kroenke ""going rogue"". They wouldn't move it if Kroenke would wait for their approval, and the league wouldn't create a lame duck last month for no reason.  BTW, that's a username I can get behind."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,Seductive_Santa,3,Mon Apr 27 08:21:09 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. You hit the nail on the head. The other owners want to feel like they have control of this situation. So they will approve it because the appearance remains. Kroenke doesn't care though. Look at his cross ownership negotiations from when he bought the team. He had a year(?) I think to transfer ownership to his son. He still hasn't done it, but the owners keep extending the deadline (begrudgingly according to a Jim Thomas report from a while back)."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,The49ersBlow,1 point,Mon Apr 27 08:24:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. This vote will be a farce, in that they will allow it because Kroenke will do it regardless IMO. And I would imagine a lot of owners will be on board anyway because LA will line their pockets."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,The49ersBlow,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:49:05 2015 UTC,"And as far as other owners, there is going to be a relocation fee to move to LA. I've read that it could be as high as $500 mil.    I've read this figure too, and even (on stltoday.com) as high as a BILLION dollar relocation fee.  But what I never read is how Davis and Spanos can afford this exorbitant fee.  If Kroenke has to pay $500 million then they both would, too.  But I don't think either guy has that much money.  The NFL can't legally charge one Owner one fee and two other Owners a much lower fee, so how can the fee be this high?   I think the correct answer is, ""it won't be that high"".  But if it is then it all but guarantees that only the Rams move.  Here's why.  In addition to the $500 million relocation fee let's not forget the other $500 million (according the stltoday.com) for practice facilities and offices.  Again, this expense would affect Davis and Spanos, not just Kroenke.  So now that's a billion dollars each from Spanos and Davis.  The Raiders and Chargers are not going to share practice facilities and they aren't going to share offices.  Where does either guy get the cash?  Do they use their teams as collateral to secure a loan?  And would they own the stadium or pay to play there and also give up the various revenue streams that stadium ownership would give them?  If they buy the stadium then that's another $500 million (at least) for each guy that they can't afford.  And if they don't own the stadium then how do they pay off their billion dollar loans?  Their only way to pay it off would be to sell the team -- how likely is it that Mark Davis would sell the Raiders?  It's his family's legacy, it's all they've got.  And he loves football and the team.  It doesn't mean he'd never sell but it makes it extremely unlikely.  Alternately, Davis could stay in Oakland on a year-to-year basis or share Levi's stadium with the Niners and save himself a billion dollars and stay in a wealthy, growing market.   If the crazy numbers that people are throwing around for a Kroenke move are accurate then Davis' best option is to stay in the Bay Area."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,DeniseDeNephew,2,Mon Apr 27 19:04:39 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere (I need to save these articles) that the Chargers and/or Raiders could be charged a different fee for relocation. They will say that it's because they are already established in the state, but it will be because Oakland and San Diego have failed to build a new stadium for their teams for decades. Whereas Kroenke has just decided he is moving without exhausting all options in STL.   But the team facilities is still a big expense. And neither of the teams are wealthy outside of owning a team. And the NFL prevents taking loans out on team value I believe."
StLouisRams,33yxzs,The49ersBlow,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"It would destroy their ability to bargain with cities   The clock is ticking on this, quickly.  This is probably why the NFL is exerting so much pressure on San Diego and Oakland to build new stadiums -- because it might be the last year they get to (in the United States).  It's probably also why Goodell began talking about Toronto and Mexico City being ""important markets"" at the Owners' Meetings last month.  The NFL needs a new threat to cities and that new threat is an international move.  LA is officially done as a credible threat (almost).  If the NFL blocks Kroenke from moving the Rams back to LA then what voters would be gullible enough to believe that their team might move there?  Or if Oakland and San Diego do go there then the market is full.  Either way the days of using LA as a threat are long gone -- except in one scenario.  If the Rams move back to LA and are the only team playing in Inglewood there would still be the possibility of a second team moving there and being that second team would be the only remaining threat.  It would bypass Obama's budgetary restrictions because the stadium would already be built."

He has a lot of very concerning accuracy issues. He makes a lot of bad decisions with the ball. He is very short and doesn't necessarily move around in the pocket well enough to compensate for that. He has decent arm strength but he has trouble getting his feet set a lot of the time which leads to inaccuracy on deep throws.  As a college QB I really did in enjoy watching Marshall. If there is one thing about Nick that he absolutely deserves to be credited for it is his demeanor. I have seen Auburn in a lot of close games and we have never had a QB that looks as comfortable late in a tight game as Marshall. He just has the innate ability to make spectacular plays happen late in games. He is without a doubt the most calm and collected QB to come out of college recently  But he isn't an NFL QB."

StLouisRams,33qkno,houseofpayne55,2,Sat Apr 25 00:42:16 2015 UTC,Interesting quotes from Peacock.  I think right now I'm leaning towards the league giving St. Louis an expansion team as the outcome... but we will see what happens.  I was hoping to get some more concrete facts but it sounds like the league is playing things close to their chest.
StLouisRams,33qkno,rdrop,5,Fri Apr 24 18:19:11 2015 UTC,I don't understand why St.Louis would get the expansion team. Wouldn't it make more sense to give the honor to LA? Someone learn me.
StLouisRams,33qkno,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:10:26 2015 UTC,"LA might get an expansion team, who knows?  (none of us do)  But all the evidence seems to indicate that Kroenke intends to move the Rams to LA so that is the most likely scenario.    Besides, an expansion team would very likely have a first-time Owner and it is unlikely that the other Owners would agree to let a newcomer have the second-largest market in the country and give their franchise an immediate Top 5 value."

StLouisRams,33qkno,TheDuke13,3,Mon Apr 27 18:00:08 2015 UTC,I don't see them expanding anytime soon. The conferences are evenly balanced. The only way I see that happening is they add a team for every conference to keep it even.
StLouisRams,33qkno,TheDuke13,3,Fri Apr 24 18:31:19 2015 UTC,Some people have mentioned a 4 team expansion as possibly working
StLouisRams,33qkno,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:33:08 2015 UTC,That would be a good deal. Better than just one and having a conference uneven.
StLouisRams,33qkno,Tre2,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:40:50 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it still be uneven?  Either at the conference level or the division level?
StLouisRams,33qkno,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"There are ways of adding 4 and evening it out, but they get weird. You have 36 teams, so you can have uneven divisions or can have 9 divisions of 4. This splits evenly into 3 conferences with 3 teams each. You want 12 playoff teams, that works perfect for the conference winners plus one wildcard from each conference. Additional playoff teams could just be more wildcards. Reseeding in the playoffs means you can have interesting superbowl matchups from any conference, even two teams from one depending on how you set it up. For scheduling, assume that you play your division (6 games), one division from each other conference (8 games) and the two seeds the same as you from your conference. Alternately, play all in conference (14 games) plus one from each other conference, or your division, one other in conference, and one out of conference.  I really like the idea of 3 conferences is what I'm saying."
StLouisRams,33qkno,Dave_the_lighting_gu,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:00:36 2015 UTC,I don't see them expanding until there are enough franchise-quality QBs available for every team to have at least one.  There aren't 32 really good QBs now so adding 4 more teams would only doom more teams to mediocrity.  Rule changes might make the QB position less important but I doubt it -- the passing game is way too exciting and the NFL would suffer if they throttled it back by much.

It's now within Governor Nixon's authority to authorize the existing municipal bonds for the Edward Jones Dome be extended, with proceeds to cover the construction of the North Riverfront Stadium! Props to Speaker of the House John Diehl for removing the line-item section at the root of this issue.   This will now authorizes sourcing the bulk of the public funding. Additional funding will be sought from the City of STL. Currently, the Stadium Authority has filed with the courts over the constitutionality of a 2002 City Ordinance on public financing of stadium projects (which from my read violates the Missouri Constitution by asserting this municipal law over established state law). While that's still be adjudicated, the State is able to proceed with funding.   While bond language remains to be executed, legally sourcing the of funding appears settled and determined. Good times."

StLouisRams,33mvgl,DabDastic,5,Thu Apr 23 21:01:08 2015 UTC,Anyone willing to explain this to somebody like me?  Seems pretty straightforward but it often helps when some hero swoops into the comments and explains what this means for us.
StLouisRams,33mvgl,One_Half_Hamster,11,Thu Apr 23 21:03:30 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that prior to this, the MO Senate could block any requests to extend existing bonds from EJD to help pay for the new stadium. This new budget now allows the GOV to do that without approval or a vote. Basically this okays the state portion of the budget for the new stadium.  Still a long way to go on the funding front, but this is a HUGE step."

StLouisRams,33mvgl,DeniseDeNephew,2,Thu Apr 23 21:27:45 2015 UTC,"Neil deMause    from FieldOfSchemes.com, which covers all stadium and arena plans, explains it like this.   Missouri senate fails to ban Rams stadium funds, threatens to refuse to make bond payments instead  Posted on April 24, 2015  by  Neil deMause   The question of who can authorize taking tax revenue currently going to pay off the Edward Jones Dome and using it to fund a new St. Louis Rams stadium has gotten ultra-crazy, with these latest developments in the state legislature:  ◾The state senate passed a bill banning using the money to pay for a new stadium.  ◾House leaders got the funding ban stricken from the bill in conference committee.  ◾Senate leaders said the governor would go ahead with selling bonds based on the Jones Dome money at his own risk, because “we’re not technically obligated to pay” and could just refuse to appropriate funds to pay off the bonds, and bondholders wouldn’t like that much, now would they?  The plan to use the Jones Dome payments for a new stadium is in plenty of trouble as it is, because then somebody would still have to pay off the Jones Dome, and in the governor’s current plan that somebody is the city of St. Louis — which has a law prohibiting new stadium funding without a public vote, and lawyers willing to sue to enforce that provision. But state senators threatening not to pay the governor’s IOUs are a nice added touch. At this point, Nixon might want to just hold a referendum already, and pull out all the stops trying to win it — though it’d undoubtedly help if Rams owner Stan Kroenke were showing any interest in helping to do so, since he’s the guy with the money for a big-bucks ad campaign. What’s the world coming to when you can’t even count on the local billionaire to buy votes?"
StLouisRams,33mvgl,Yji,10,Fri Apr 24 17:57:21 2015 UTC,This is huge. A lot of progress towards funding the stadium.

StLouisRams,33mvgl,TheDuke13,7,Thu Apr 23 22:06:49 2015 UTC,Still requires $250 million from Kroenke.
StLouisRams,33mvgl,Opifex,5,Thu Apr 23 23:27:21 2015 UTC,Or any other owner.  This really opens up the possibility of another team relocating if Kroenke really is set on moving.
StLouisRams,33mvgl,bozo7337,3,Fri Apr 24 01:07:59 2015 UTC,Plus the G4 money from him. This is a good step for the St Louis stadium though.
StLouisRams,33mvgl,Popolar,13,Fri Apr 24 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"Aye, and Kroenke still requires approval from the league :)"
StLouisRams,33mvgl,TheDuke13,7,Thu Apr 23 23:40:13 2015 UTC,"That's true, but when an owner says that Kroenke gets what he wants I believe him, especially when that guy is Jerry Jones. He (Jerry) may not be a good sports guy but he knows business and he plays a pretty huge part in NFL's business. I just don't see him (Kroenke) not moving at this point.

Of course, but there is a huge gap in talent between Kevin White / Amari Cooper and him.

StLouisRams,33mf1h,reallifebadass,2,Fri Apr 24 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"This has made me much more excited than previous renderings. I really hope the surrounding area is nice. My big concern is how small the stadium is. Realistically it is too small to ever host any big event and I could see that being discouraging for someone like Stan. The LA stadium can easily do things like Pac championship games, Super Bowl, Bowl games. I also really want this built so we can get an MLS team."
StLouisRams,33mf1h,rbkfour,3,Thu Apr 23 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"64,000 seat capacity. Big enough for most major events and still affordable."

StLouisRams,33mf1h,SoulardSTL,-12,Thu Apr 23 21:10:27 2015 UTC,This stadium doesn't look great at all. It's just a rendering. I give it a 8/10 in a digital world. It will end up being a 5/10 after budget cuts and realistic expectations. Our poor stadium was going to be state of the art 20 years ago. It never was and it will never be. Compare this to what L.A. has to offer and we can talk.
StLouisRams,33mf1h,madsquish,6,Thu Apr 23 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"The same expectations can apply to any digital rendering then, even LA. Plus, when they build the EDJ (TWA 4eva) dome, they weren't competing with another city trying to snatch the Rams up. I think this is different. There's more on the line."

See Minnesota, Atlanta, and the LA proposals. Needs a retractable roof for starters. Good luck hosting any bowl games, with a roof you could get easily get a bowl. Even Indianapolis hosted a SB because of the roof. Don't think because the league gave NY/NJ a SB they will give STL one. The video thing in the seats is cool, but the rest is blah.  It looks more like a college stadium than where a professional team should play."

StLouisRams,33olfq,Sauceman87,4,Fri Apr 24 05:44:11 2015 UTC,"I would be fine with White or Cooper. I don't think that we should take any other WR in this draft with the 10th overall pick because these are the two standout options this year. If we really want a WR in the first round and White or Cooper are gone, I would rather we trade back and fortify our number of picks."
StLouisRams,33olfq,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:10:47 2015 UTC,"I would hope that if we are at 10 and they arent there that we would take Scherff. Which seems like the worst case scenario and it's still a fantastic pick. I dont think we take anything at 10 besides Martioa(he wont be there), Cooper(probs wont be there), White, or Scherff. There's only fantasy scenarios that one of those arent there at 10, but if they aren't there then we trade down because there will be teams itching for a chance to get a big name dlineman that we just don't need."
StLouisRams,33olfq,Thonked,2,Fri Apr 24 20:47:20 2015 UTC,"I actually want Scherff very badly.  I think he is exactly what we need on our O-Line right now (though I might be biased, I am a big Hawkeyes fan).  If Scherff, Cooper, or White aren't there at 10, I think we would be crazy not to trade down for a few picks.  I just don't see any benefit to drafting another project receiver when our receiving corps is almost entirely built out of them currently."
StLouisRams,33olfq,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:55:20 2015 UTC,I agree... Almost. I wouldn't pick Scherff over us finally having a true number one wr in white or cooper. Look at what kelvin Benjamin did for Carolina with the horrible oline they had. Scherff would definitely be huge for our oline but I think we'd just give up coverage sacks or be one dimensional in the run game.
StLouisRams,33olfq,Thonked,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:01:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry should have specified, I would love to have White or Cooper as they are the only receivers this draft who won't be some kind of project to get them up to speed, I would pick them over Scherff as well.  I am just assuming that Scherff is going to be the player most likely left for us, and that I would be excited to have him on our line!"

StLouisRams,33lwnt,bozo7337,17,Thu Apr 23 19:48:10 2015 UTC,That parking space...  We could actually tailgate!
StLouisRams,33lwnt,FaulktheBlueRedbird,8,Thu Apr 23 17:25:15 2015 UTC,"Tailgating would be nice. We have a lot of Mizzou grads in St. Louis who like tailgating on Saturdays, but it's pretty much a crap shoot on Sundays."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,panderson1988,2,Thu Apr 23 18:52:30 2015 UTC,Some neutral site games here would be cool also. Don't know who we would play from the east though.
StLouisRams,33lwnt,mlasn,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:05:13 2015 UTC,It certainly is a big step up in room but from what I've seen would still be on the smaller side of tailgating room. Then I guess too much parking is probably a waste.
StLouisRams,33lwnt,mlasn,2,Thu Apr 23 21:04:39 2015 UTC,This is perfect you can still park and walk to a centralized tailgating place
StLouisRams,33lwnt,bleedblue89,3,Thu Apr 23 23:30:06 2015 UTC,"I'm reserving my hope this will actually get done, but overall I like the design and purpose. It's simplistic, but modern. One thing I hate about the Falcons stadium is it looks way over the top. I like the dual jumbotrons, but I kinda wish the South Endzone was more open to see the Arch. I think having the Arch skyline would be cool and impressive to show off, similar with Bush Stadium. Otherwise, it looks nice. I think if it was built, then seeing a game there would be very enjoyable."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,panderson1988,3,Thu Apr 23 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"The Arch should be visible from a good number of seats. While not a straight-shot like in Busch Stadium, it's so tall that it simply cannot hide. Plus, it looks like there'll be good stadium views of the towers of the Musial Bridge when looking north; very, very cool."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,SoulardSTL,8,Thu Apr 23 21:40:42 2015 UTC,Looking good. Also the news of selecting a construction manager is good news. Things keep pressing forward.
StLouisRams,33lwnt,Kaos047,7,Thu Apr 23 16:25:47 2015 UTC,I want this to be built so bad id sell my soul.
StLouisRams,33lwnt,DabDastic,0,Thu Apr 23 16:24:24 2015 UTC,That master plan that included the arch construction though.... Hnnnnnngh
StLouisRams,33lwnt,The_Wayward,3,Thu Apr 23 16:44:02 2015 UTC,Nice looking stadium and the area of St. Louis needs to be reinvented. My main question in regards to the project is financing. The only things they mention are a strong commitment from the NFL and its local team. They have yet to receive that commitment. They've hired a financial consultant though so is this firm looking for other private funding sources? I'm just asking the question not attacking or criticizing so don't get mad at me. The money to build this is the most important factor and this website glosses over it.
StLouisRams,33lwnt,bozo7337,3,Thu Apr 23 16:38:36 2015 UTC,"News just came out a little bit ago that the State funding source, extending the EJD bonds, can happen.   Missouri General Assembly (House & Senate) have passed the State's budget today, which the Governor will still have to sign. The MO Speaker of the House removed the line-item section from the budget that would've prevented the Governor from extending these bonds towards the North Riverfront Stadium's construction. Only after this was removed did the Speaker let this section of the budget be authorized. It was included as part of the total State budget, and news is up that it's been voted on & passed.   Funding from the City of STL must still be determined, i.e. the City courts reviewing the constitutionality of the 2002 City Ordinance about funding for stadiums (which in my read appears to position local laws over precedent state laws and thereby would be unconstitutional). Otherwise, the vast majority of public funding is now ready to be tapped.   Going forward, the North Riverfront Stadium will seek funding from the Rams and the NFL. The League will likely support this through the G4 program. But, the remainder will have to come from the team, and nothing will be built until this is settled. For all we know, the Rams could be voted by League ownership to stay in STL, but Kroenke theoretically could decide to keep the team in the EJD."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,SoulardSTL,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:57:46 2015 UTC,I had read this and my question is how much funding is this? Is this the funding that went to EJD moves over? Or is it something else.
StLouisRams,33lwnt,bozo7337,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:18:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. The State already contributes about $12MM/year towards the EJD bonds. With today's vote, the Governor's office will remain authorized to reallocate these monies towards the North Riverfront Stadium's construction (should it happen). The State's contribution would be about 2/3 of the public funding side. The City of STL will likely contribute $6MM/year once the ordinance case gets through."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,SoulardSTL,5,Thu Apr 23 22:36:10 2015 UTC,"You are absolutely right on the financial plan. It seems the task force is keeping all of the financial info close to the chest for the time being and only have stated that the plan is ""evolving as the stadium plan has evolved."" They will keep developing the project, and eventually, there will have to be a yay or neigh moment with Kroenke/NFL that will determine a lot."

StLouisRams,33lwnt,CMill314,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:16:52 2015 UTC,"I saw the article at the bottom of the page, my point still stands that they should be advertising that much more heavily."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,bwc_28,2,Fri Apr 24 03:33:52 2015 UTC,Stl won't get an MLS team at point. And if the do it'll probably be 10 years away.
StLouisRams,33lwnt,mjbatt,10,Thu Apr 23 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe so, but selling the stadium to taxpayers as dual purpose makes it easier to swallow. More people would be willing to pay it. That's what they did in Seattle when the Hawks were threatening to move, CenturyLink was built and sold as dual use. The whole point was to get an MLS expansion team, which didn't happen until seven years after the stadium was built. Despite the delay there's no way the stadium would've been funded if it hadn't been dual purpose. Making a dual purpose stadium is what saved the Hawks in Seattle. I really think St Louis is making a massive mistake by ignoring what Seattle did. St Louis has the market for soccer, those fans would help vote for a new stadium for the Rams if they at least had hope that an MLS expansion would come soon. Even if it's just hope and nothing more."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,bwc_28,3,Thu Apr 23 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"Actually, it may be closer than we know. For the past few years, STL has been courted by MLS. I know two distinct groups who've been courted as prospective owners of a STL franchise within recent history. The only holdup has been a site for them to play.   MLS Commissioner Don Garber has already been to meetings in STL with Peacock & Co., to verify that the proposed North Riverfront Stadium would be designed with dual-use in mind. And, MLS said they'll look to having more than 24 teams in the relative near term.   While I agree that it won't be anything immediate, i.e. within 2 years, it's reasonable to see expansion by 2020, should this be built."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,SoulardSTL,2,Thu Apr 23 21:48:14 2015 UTC,"If it's built it will make them a front runner. But other cities like Sacramento, already have a team that exist and are doing well. if I remember properly Sac republic has 10k season ticket holders and is just city approval away from having a stadium ready for MLS. And even then Sac probably wouldn't join before 2020.   STL becomes a front runner if they build this stadium. But there is plenty of competition and it's not a done deal that they will get an expansion team. But they are definitely in the conversation when MLS expands to 25-30 teams."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,mjbatt,2,Thu Apr 23 23:19:15 2015 UTC,Stl won't get an MLS team at point. And if the do it'll probably be 10 years away.   Want to explain why exactly you think this?
StLouisRams,33lwnt,Kaos047,3,Thu Apr 23 19:08:56 2015 UTC,Yeah.. It is currently impossible to get STL FC tickets and the bleachers are always packed to full capacity... I feel like it would be irresponsible not to give STL an MLS team in the near future.
StLouisRams,33lwnt,chichi98SPORTS,3,Thu Apr 23 19:24:43 2015 UTC,"MLS has already committed to LA2 Miami Atlanta and Minnesota. Bringing it's total number of teams to 24 by 2020. (Hopefully)  As of right now there are several teams bidding to also join MLS. Most of these cities are far ahead of STL in terms of support. Personally I would place, Sacramento, San Antonio, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, and Carolina ahead of STL in the race for an expansion slot.   Expanding too fast is bad for parity so I imagine after 2020 they will begin slowly bringing in new teams possibly every 2-3years depending on many different factors of course. STL unfortunately is near the bottom of the list of expansion cities and it's fair to assume a 10+ year wait is reasonable. If they build a Soccer specific stadium like Orlando or Minnesota they could jump the line and snag an expansion slot. But it'll still be after LA2, Miami, Minnesota, ATL and probably after Sacramento and San Antonio get in."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,mjbatt,4,Thu Apr 23 19:27:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. I dont follow soccer to closely, I just know STL sells out quickly every soccer event they have here. I didnt realize there was such a demand for expansion MLS teams."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,Kaos047,2,Thu Apr 23 19:32:35 2015 UTC,"No problem, currently the MLS is going through a similar situation the NFL had in the 90s. Its expanding rapidly and carefully deciding where the teams should be.   Very exciting times over at /r/mls"
StLouisRams,33lwnt,mjbatt,3,Thu Apr 23 19:51:15 2015 UTC,Don't follow it much either but I thought STL was one of the front runners a few years ago?
StLouisRams,33lwnt,mlasn,2,Thu Apr 23 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"While I am certainly no expert (and you seem like you'd be well versed to answer this question): Why do you think we're towards the bottom of the list for MLS expansion?

StLouisRams,33lwnt,Magnemmike,3,Thu Apr 23 18:52:37 2015 UTC,Isn't that like $1.4Bn less than the LA stadium? Obviously ignoring the quality differences.
StLouisRams,33lwnt,mlasn,3,Thu Apr 23 21:07:57 2015 UTC,"Your math's wrong, /u/magnemmike; only half that amount's being sought. 200MM will come from the NFL (G4), and 200-250MM will be sought from the team. And yes, for all we know, Kroenke could decide to keep the team in the Edward Jones Dome and build nothing."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,SoulardSTL,0,Thu Apr 23 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"This is correct,  but,   That G4 loan from the NFL is still paid back from the teams revenue.   Hence why I was saying the 400."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,Magnemmike,7,Thu Apr 23 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"Noting as well that there is a high correlation between G4 monies and increased revenue generation, all while there is a near-zero percent interest rate upon these monies. Essentially, a G4 allocation would be a bridge loan that'd pay itself back from increased facility revenues. Kroenke could elect to contribute the full 400-450MM in cash, but that's not really utilizing the opportunity of keeping one's cash flows at the ready, and it's assumed he'd accept the G4 if offered, if he decides to follow-through on the North Riverfront Stadium's construction."
StLouisRams,33lwnt,SoulardSTL,8,Thu Apr 23 22:50:28 2015 UTC,"I get it now. You are a troll. You go into every stadium thread to crap on STL fans who have a brief glimpse of hope. Then what is insulting is if you are a Rams fan, then where is your flair?   You are a joke, and a bad joke at that. Get some new material instead of talking about how your opinions are absolute, and you ignore any good response to you because it doesn't' fit your narrative."

StLouisRams,33lwnt,Magnemmike,6,Thu Apr 23 19:08:49 2015 UTC,"I would if you didn't go into every stadium thread, and that is it with comments like how it's over for STL, how it's finance, and basically ignore posts that explain things that don't fit your narrative. If you were a fan, then get some flair, partake in other threads, and so forth. There are no comments from you on draft news, or the schedule, or anything but stadium news. Otherwise, stick with Chargers board because that seems to be your team since you partake in more Chargers news besides the Rams with the exception of crapping up every thread saying it's over for STL."

Not really breaking news by any means, and throughout the Summer and Fall we'll probably get a better feel for which stadium site is gonna be the one the league rolls with.  2 tidbits from following this situation 1) Even though they've committed to their own stadium, the Chargers have acknowledged that moving in with the Rams is an option 2) Peacock and his crew are presenting to the NFL today on their plan."
StLouisRams,33g94u,Seductive_Santa,4,Wed Apr 22 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Last night was significant, and it was fully foreseeable.   Edit: You're right, the STL Group is presenting today to the NFL LA Task Force. Forgot what day it was today. Too much work, clouding up my brain... FYI I did hear that Peacock & Co. may not be talking much publicly until Friday, after the NYC meetings wrap up. Not sure how much news we'll be hearing about until then."
StLouisRams,33g94u,SoulardSTL,4,Wed Apr 22 17:37:10 2015 UTC,"Couple quick questions...  First off, it's been reported that the Carson site will now feature some side projects, i.e. 850,000 sq.ft. of mixed-use retail & facilities for NFL Network, and a 350 room hotel. Are there any updated renderings of these buildings that've been released? If so, could someone provide a link to these renderings? Thanks.      Secondly, the OC Register's report on Carson last night mentioned it is possible that        ""One or more franchises could announce their intention to relocate to Los Angeles as early as September, according to people familiar with the three teams’ plans.""        Has anyone else heard about a September decision being possible? Last I heard, the League itself wouldn't be making any decisions until November at the earliest. This is the first I've heard of franchises being able to file relocation requests this early, and it certainly could create some ""lame duck"" seasons.   Reminder that the Rams, Chargers, Raiders, and STL Group will be presenting in NYC this week before the NFL's LA Task Force."
StLouisRams,33g94u,SoulardSTL,3,Wed Apr 22 17:46:33 2015 UTC,"They haven't formally moved up the decision deadline, though the most likely will. Inglewood can build in December (and I think Carson sometime in 2016, though I can't confirm), so they likely want whichever course of action before they could potentially break ground.  And that's good to hear that there's some additional development in Carson. As someone who wants the league back in my neck of the woods, it's nice to see both projects looking more well rounded."
StLouisRams,33g94u,Seductive_Santa,2,Thu Apr 23 01:54:43 2015 UTC,"Noting my bias, I'm a big fan of Carson as a plan for the NFL in Los Angeles. LA does need football; I just hope STL gets to keep our team. I have read that Carson would break ground in 2016 at an undetermined date, but reasonably swiftly, in time for a team or teams to play there by 2019.   I still believe the best plan would have been to franchise new teams to the League, with LA getting two (NFC & AFC), and two franchises for new markets, maybe San Antonio, maybe Toronto. That would have solved this entire situation all at once. Looking back on the mess here today, one that'll likely see ugly lawsuits this time next year, I'm sure they'll wish they'd have done so, too."
StLouisRams,33g94u,SoulardSTL,2,Thu Apr 23 15:54:15 2015 UTC,"Well this is big news, it seems like the Chargers have one foot out the door as well"
StLouisRams,33g94u,DabDastic,4,Wed Apr 22 15:10:25 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the Raiders, too. Neither Oakland nor San Diego are close to producing what STL has generated already."
StLouisRams,33g94u,SoulardSTL,-6,Wed Apr 22 17:21:51 2015 UTC,"Technically true,  but  St. Louis has not really done anything but draw pictures.   Land is not yet secured,  no funding, peacock did say that they have a company to build.   All necessary steps that Oakland and San Diego have yet to do.     The thing with the raiders and chargers,  they both need each other.   As an example,  if the chargers get their stadium the raiders won't be able to move by themselves to Carson.  Or vice versa. This likely leaves a team to move in with stan in Inglewood.  The thing with Inglewood,   It's already has everything.  Land is acquired,  funding, it's been voted on and is ready to go.  What's holding back?   Stan.  He probably could go rogue (he won't)  but for the sake or argument,  let's say he does.   There isn't anything else he will need.   Inglewood is so far ahead of everyone, there isn't a need for Carson.  Carson,  is a leverage play.  But do-able. St. Louis,   What are they bringing to the table?  An Anheiser Busch guy saying he's working on the problem..."
StLouisRams,33g94u,Magnemmike,3,Thu Apr 23 07:48:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, the STL plan for the new riverfront stadium is much further along than what you may understand. The vast majority of land is assembled; the majority of funding has been identified, with much already obtained through tax credits; they've made agreements with proximate utilities & infrastructure (rerouting rail traffic and electric conduits); and construction planning is fully ready, from management of the development & partnerships with construction firms to agreements with organized labor to work in multiple shifts, around the clock, without overtime.   With their meeting yesterday, Peacock & Co. apparently went into much detail, enough to have their presentation last about 45 minutes plus Q&A from what I've read. The construction management groups presented their timelines, and the architects were present to note requested updates to the site plan. By and large, it looks like they have their act fully together, with some reporters going so far to say that the STL Riverfront Stadium plan had as much detail, if not more, than the LA developments. Who knows. Guess we'll find out soon...   FYI Peacock & Co. are within a non-disclosure period right now where they're not going to talk to the media about the details of their presentation. They are planning on a press briefing tomorrow, at which time they're likely going to produce their supporting work from yesterday's meetings.   Meanwhile, neither Oakland nor San Diego have even a preliminary plan for what their stadiums will look like, let alone funding. You're right, they do need each other for Carson to be the optimum development. From what I've seen, they know this, and they're progressing together. I don't like seeing other markets lose their teams, and I have empathy here, but I do want to keep my team."

Week 1: vs. Seahawks - great way to start the season  Week 2: at Redskins - winnable  Week 3: vs. Steelers - winnable  Week 4: at Cardinals - tough game, Cardinals could be really good  Week 5: at Packers - likely loss  Week 6: Bye - not the worst time to have a bye week  Week 7: vs. Browns - winnable  Week 8: vs. 49ers - winnable  Week 9: at Vikings - should be a win, but what the hell was last season's game?  Week 10: vs. Bears - winnable  Week 11: at Ravens - tough, I think the Ravens are looking good  Week 12: probably at Bengals - who knows what type of Bengals team we'll get, but we could win this one for sure  Week 13: vs. Cardinals - tough team, but we play them very well at home  Week 14: vs. Lions - tough, but home ""advantage"" helps theoretically  Week 15: vs. Buccaneers - should be a win  Week 16: at Seahawks - likely loss  Week 17: at 49ers - I'm hoping to sweep the niners this year  What a tough start to the season before entering the bye.  After the bye I really think if we come out strong we can make a run for it.  It's a really tough schedule, but I hope our guys can muscle through it in the middle stretch."
StLouisRams,33f09d,daedalus000,5,Wed Apr 22 00:06:10 2015 UTC,"I think if we can make it to the bye week with at least a couple wins, we will be good"
StLouisRams,33f09d,genericman12,7,Wed Apr 22 00:17:37 2015 UTC,"My only fear is a potential 1-4 record going into the bye, which I think is a very real possibility.  I think for a young team that could be too demoralizing and deflate them early.  However, the tough games early on could really galvanize them and make them give other teams hell after the bye week."

We aren't extremely deep at S, LB, CB (could make an argument here), and our talent is unknown or questionable at several positions: QB, WR, S, RT, C. But we still have the draft. I don't think we use our first round pick on a QB, S, or C. That leaves T or WR or the likely event that we trade down."

StLouisRams,33f09d,daedalus000,2,Wed Apr 22 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"Why do you think a young team will open the season beating Seattle and then beat a very tough Steelers team, and follow that up by beating the Cardinals IN AZ? By the end of the season you have us losing to AZ at home.  4/20 was on Monday.. not yesterday  It's fun to get hyped about our team and be optimistic, but you're expecting incredible improvement on a tough schedule.  Edit - I'll give you guys this… On any given day we could beat any of the teams we're playing. But... seriously… 12-4? Starting 4-1? How long have you been a Rams fan? That's Patriots level, and we're not there yet. Maybe someday.   With the 9ers falling apart, we have a chance to make the playoffs, but even that is being optimistic. We're still young and have very few weapons on offense. Also, we're going to build our O-line from the draft? I just don't see us scoring enough points to win 12 games. Defense can win in the playoffs, but as we've witnessed, you still need an offense to go with your defense.  Why would you expect the Cards to stick with Lindsey? Seriously, if they can help it, there's no way they do that."
StLouisRams,33f09d,chemshua,4,Wed Apr 22 14:38:07 2015 UTC,"The logic I can see with the Seahawks is that we have actually trended to beating them in STL a lot. We aren't afraid of using trickery to do it, but I can see that win happening."

StLouisRams,33f09d,nhuff90,0,Wed Apr 22 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"The Seahawks secondary will be lucky to be healthy and ready to go by the beginning of the season. On the contrast, our secondary is entirely healthy and maybe even getting boosted in the draft. My hope is that Russell Wilson is currently creating a riff with his team with this HUGE contract talks.  Marshawn Lynch took a beating in the playoffs, and we have shut him down before. Their WRs are ""scary"" lol, their O line started to suck last year, so Russell Wilson had to carry the team. JG will be a tough cover tho... I'm not sure who we'll deploy on him. But we sure do have a shitty defensive coordinator that doesn't know how to scheme./s  But we will have a new QB that the Seahawks aren't extremely familiar with, plus Aaron Donald is more experienced and so is our line and we added N.Fairley.  Plus we have a top 10 pick in the 1&2 round... While Seattle's first pick will be round 2 pick 31. Lol...  Pit - they just had 2 starters in their secondary retire this week. This offseason the lost Troy, Ike, Jason Worilds... I believe even more than that. They also are probably losing James Harrison. But they have had I did stretch on this one, but their best weapons are their slot WR, QB , and RB.  Our best secondary player last year also happened to play... Slot CB (Gaines). So that leaves the run game and the QB. Well we all know we have pass rush, does it get there... Maybe. Their running back will test our LBs, but we did just boost our LB core by signing Ayers.    Arizona- doesn't have Palmer back yet and we always play decent against them.  Did you see their backup in the playoffs?"
StLouisRams,33f09d,corbilm,14,Wed Apr 22 22:01:16 2015 UTC,"One thing I see that I like is the fact that the Steelers game is early in the season, I think LeVeon Bell might actually still be suspended when the Rams play him.   The other thing is that for the first time in 3 years the season doesn't end in Seattle, but it still ends on the road.   I'd have to look at it more, but I'm really liking this schedule,. There's no ridiculous stretch like last season it seems like, and the bye weeks isn't week four so a lot for me to look forward to."
StLouisRams,33f09d,Patticus_Finch,7,Wed Apr 22 00:10:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, going into the schedule I thought we would get rocked as always with hard scheduling, but I'm actually liking it a lot, given the teams we play."
StLouisRams,33f09d,daedalus000,7,Wed Apr 22 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"I'm liking it a lot more than past seasons, there's tough small game stretches like weeks 3-5 and weeks 11-14 but no 7 games stretches like last season. There's also a bunch more games sprinkled in that worry me, but for some reason I'm a lot more accepting about this schedule than last seasons. haha"
StLouisRams,33f09d,Patticus_Finch,2,Wed Apr 22 00:30:17 2015 UTC,"Same.  Those final 6 games could be huge for us if we can get some playoff momentum going with the 4 straight home games followed by @Seahawks, @49ers.  I'm pumped."

These games can be a real variable, having the team game up again after just four days rest, and right after the Rams'll be taking on the Lions on Week 14 Sunday. But, since Tampa's been historically weak, this could be a great moment for the team to harness some late-season momentum, and to have a fun night game to close the season at home.   The League is also likely thinking that this should be a high-scoring game if they want it as a late-season Thursday Night game, which have been known to lose audience if the teams playing both suck. The schedulers must be anticipating big things from the Rams this year.   Best part: The Rams will have over a week to rest up & strategize for Week 16 in Seattle. That time to recover could be the Rams' best advantage towards taking out the Seahawks at CenturyLink Field."
StLouisRams,33f09d,thebluick,-1,Wed Apr 22 18:06:54 2015 UTC,"Looking at this schedule, I have the Rams at 7-9 again.  I have too many questions about the team to think they will be legitimately better than last year, and this schedule looks fairly average in terms of difficulty."
StLouisRams,33f09d,price-iz-right,3,Wed Apr 22 01:52:22 2015 UTC,"Fucking Rams...improve every year, everyone doubts us. We easily break .500 this year with this schedule, we might make a playoff run. And that's with LAST years team."
StLouisRams,33f09d,One_Half_Hamster,2,Wed Apr 22 02:44:46 2015 UTC,If we are able to keep a consistent tempo in all four quarters we will be fine. We just need to stop giving away 21+ point leads.
StLouisRams,33f09d,price-iz-right,2,Wed Apr 22 03:04:21 2015 UTC,That shit stopped once our defense figured out William's scheme. Our problem is usually penalties and not scoring early and often (or not fucking scoring at all till it's too late.) last year we had a whole lot of meh on offense and expecting the defense to save us with quick stops and pick 6 etc. Hopefully our offense is in it to fucking win it this year and we'll be solid. I expect our defense to beat ass like it's been doing for the past half season.

StLouisRams,339kti,FaulktheBlueRedbird,6,Fri Apr 24 01:05:55 2015 UTC,I may be a little upset if we go defense with our first round pick again this year...
StLouisRams,339kti,Kaos047,13,Mon Apr 20 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"If Scherff is gone and we can't get value trading down, I like this pick. Especially if Waynes lives up to his potential. Imagine our defense with a shut down corner."
StLouisRams,339kti,porkfish66,7,Mon Apr 20 19:36:09 2015 UTC,Very good point. If we could find another Aaron Donald in this range on defense that would be pretty amazing.
StLouisRams,339kti,Kaos047,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:42:47 2015 UTC,Danny Shelton.
StLouisRams,339kti,bwc_28,8,Mon Apr 20 20:48:54 2015 UTC,"I should have clarified, I meant another Aaron Donald type talent at that range. If we draft D-line in the first at 10 I will throw things on draft day!"
StLouisRams,339kti,Kaos047,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:51:11 2015 UTC,"Again, Danny Shelton fits that description. He'll probably be there at 10 and will be an absolute beast in the middle and has the potential to be DROY. I agree that we don't need another first round d-lineman though."
StLouisRams,339kti,bwc_28,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:53:15 2015 UTC,I would only be cool with it if we could trade down and still get him. We probably need to draft 2 starers on the o line.
StLouisRams,339kti,kahyote484,4,Tue Apr 21 03:26:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's important for this sub to understand our drafting situation. At 10 we are going to take the best player available regardless of position. Sure it's nice to grab a need, but we would kick ourselves in the ass if we pass up a great for an O lineman we could have gotten in the 3rd or 5th round. It's just sound drafting policy."
StLouisRams,339kti,price-iz-right,3,Tue Apr 21 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"I still want OL, but this would be an okay pick. You know Jenkins is going to walk next year, would be nice to be ready for it."
StLouisRams,339kti,RammingIntoChicks,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:15:47 2015 UTC,Wait what? Where have you heard that Jenkins is going to walk next year?
StLouisRams,339kti,porkfish66,3,Tue Apr 21 01:22:22 2015 UTC,"He's a UFA next year. I'd guess what Golden means is that Jenkins is the kind of guy who has a vastly inflated estimation of his own worth, and there's some CB hungry teams out there."
StLouisRams,339kti,porkfish66,3,Tue Apr 21 01:34:33 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not exactly inflated if he can indeed get that kind of money. And I think he will."
StLouisRams,339kti,RammingIntoChicks,4,Tue Apr 21 01:42:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, there are GMs out there who're going to judge his potential based on his best plays. And doing that with Jenkins is a huge mistake, as we all know. Fucker gambles way too much, blows too many coverages trying to play the ball.  The more I think about it the more I like the idea of drafting Waynes. It's a proactive pick now, rather than an absolute need in 12 months. And hell, if Waynes doesn't have a great rookie season, we'll still have the option of throwing too much cash at Jenkins."
StLouisRams,339kti,New_DudeToo,0,Tue Apr 21 01:56:47 2015 UTC,"Nowhere, but consider what we know about him and his personality. He'll almost certainly have plenty of FA offers. Do you think he'll choose loyalty to the team over a chance to move to a warmer climate and to have more money for throwing lavish parties?"
StLouisRams,339kti,jpatjpatjpat,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:33:12 2015 UTC,Well we may offer him plenty of money and sadly we may be moving to a warmer climate (although I hope to god it doesn't happen)

StLouisRams,339nfs,Bskrilla,5,Mon Apr 20 22:34:22 2015 UTC,"lol sorry if it was a dumb question. I didn't think flat billed hats were made to be bent. Not the bill itself, how it's connected to the hat."
StLouisRams,339nfs,D9-EM,2,Tue Apr 21 00:40:21 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware pretty much all hats come with a flat bill, and then you bend it to your own liking."
StLouisRams,339nfs,Bskrilla,2,Tue Apr 21 00:50:08 2015 UTC,Scroll through theses hats you'll see what I'm talking about.
StLouisRams,339nfs,D9-EM,2,Tue Apr 21 01:50:19 2015 UTC,I know what you're saying. There's definitely a difference. If you curved a flat bill hat it would look really weird and probably not fit right i think.
StLouisRams,339nfs,rb7_brady,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:50:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree, as would a lot of baseball fans. It's quite common for baseball players/fans to curve the brim of a New Era 59Fifty hat. That and heat up the brim with water or a hair dryer to make the crown less boxy and shape to your head more naturally. Common enough for them to start making low crown versions of teams on-field hats which are selling really well. Personally, I think curving the brim looks fine, and it fits better for me as the bill is in line with my head and not sticking out to the sides.  Here's my Rams hat from the side and from the front with a curved brim and a heat-lowered crown. I don't think it looks weird at all, just like a taller version of those low-crown hats, but I guess it's personal preference. A lot of people like to leave the stickers on their hats and a lot of people think that looks stupid."
StLouisRams,339nfs,mmann-ion,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:09:55 2015 UTC,Yeah i guess it really just comes down to personal preference. I personally don't like that because like you said its a little taller. But to each their own!
StLouisRams,339nfs,rb7_brady,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:36:14 2015 UTC,you can't bend a flat billed hat. The material will break. Flexed bill hats cant be straightened either but you can try and they wont break they just won't hold shape.

StLouisRams,3397tp,IAmA_scientist2,8,Mon Apr 20 17:35:34 2015 UTC,"I think if Cooper is available (I'll be shocked if he is) then I think he should absolutely be the pick at ten. The only lineman I would want at 10 is Scherrf and there's really no telling if he'll be available either as several teams ahead of the rams are in need of oline help as well. I truly believe that Cooper could be a really special player and it would be silly to pass on him to purely to fill a more dire need. Taking a linemen in the first guarantees nothing. Jason Smith and Alex Barron still haunt my nightmares. The Rams should take the best player available and Cooper, at least in my opinion, is better than any olineman in the draft."

StLouisRams,3397tp,ramSACKcity,17,Tue Apr 21 13:02:45 2015 UTC,"If Cooper is there at 10, I think we should definitely consider it.  I would skip on White.  I would also really think of trading back if Cooper or White were available at 10.  We could move back and get a good return for Cooper."
StLouisRams,3397tp,axle69,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:08:02 2015 UTC,Cooper is the only WR id take in the first and that's only if we end up re signing Barksdale.

StLouisRams,3397tp,SoulardSTL,15,Tue Apr 21 13:01:19 2015 UTC,This obsession with us drafting a receiver is getting old.
StLouisRams,3397tp,_Randy_Magnum_,15,Mon Apr 20 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed. While our receiving corps needs attention, I'm more concerned with our offensive line for top picks than another green WR."
StLouisRams,3397tp,Davidfreeze,3,Mon Apr 20 18:09:02 2015 UTC,"Right? There are much bigger needs to be filled on our offensive line first. They're plenty of serviceable WRs in the draft, but they are all going to need longer than a few seconds to run a route."
StLouisRams,3397tp,bozo7337,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:24:39 2015 UTC,"If we resign Barksdale, we are looking for an G and C, not typically picked first round, so a true number 1 WR or a lockdown corner sounds great"
StLouisRams,3397tp,The49ersBlow,5,Wed Apr 22 05:09:00 2015 UTC,If Cooper is there he'd be a great pick. Certainly better and more of a need than most all of the defense options. I'm convinced though that we trade down this year.
StLouisRams,3397tp,porkfish66,4,Mon Apr 20 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"I would love for the Rams to sprint to the podium if Cooper is there. He is such a polished prospect with the body and measurables of a number 1 that our team hasn't had since Holt. However, I don't see White the same way. Nor do I see Parker in the same light either. If they trade the pick with Cooper on the board, I will be disappointed. We have talent at WR, so it's not a need, but we lack playmakers, and Cooper fits that description."
StLouisRams,3397tp,bwc_28,5,Mon Apr 20 22:55:59 2015 UTC,"Only if Scherff is gone. Even then, I'd rather see us trade down or take Waynes."

StLouisRams,3397tp,hlainelarkinmk2,2,Mon Apr 20 22:31:33 2015 UTC,Our QB needs to be able to throw the ball before we think about getting another WR. O-line please!
StLouisRams,3397tp,bozo7337,2,Mon Apr 20 18:19:44 2015 UTC,Personally I think both will be off the board at 10.
StLouisRams,3397tp,edubs_stl,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:33:23 2015 UTC,I agree but if they're there it's a draft day win. I think they're gone as is Scherff so we end up trading down.
StLouisRams,3397tp,livmeister,1 point,Mon Apr 20 23:24:33 2015 UTC,St Louis really should trade down only problem is finding a partner. Also I really don't buy the hype for Scherff but to each their own
StLouisRams,3397tp,rloftis6,2,Tue Apr 21 00:01:59 2015 UTC,Lining him up next to Robinson would be a great power blocking duo in the run game which is what Fisher claims is our focus on offense.

StLouisRams,337cii,Davidfreeze,6,Wed Apr 22 05:17:55 2015 UTC,"No. We don't need yet another project WR. There are good centers and guards we should be looking at here instead. Honestly I'd rather see us use our first rounder on a WR than our 2nd. Not that I really want that either, but it's better positional value."
StLouisRams,337cii,porkfish66,3,Mon Apr 20 19:33:23 2015 UTC,"If you are in love with the way Quick's career has been, then yeah get excited. He (dgb) has done nothing to excite me at all. It will take him forever to even be third string. I think it would be a waste of time when we could get Agholor who could compete with Quick or Bailey immediately."
StLouisRams,337cii,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,2,Mon Apr 20 14:21:25 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of Stephen Hill as a player which isn't good (insane physical traits, actual football skills lacking). Dude is lazy on the field with his route running and his work ethic has been called into question repeatedly. Off the field issues remind me of Janoris without even the illusion of getting them fixed. DGB missed the 2014 season, Janoris at least played in his final collegiate season even if it was at North Alabama. Actually this might be unfair to Jenkins since it was only pot that got him kicked out and not an alleged involvement with a burglary along with allegedly shoving someone down some stairs.  I would not be excited by the pick, I would hope that everything I'm reading about him is wrong, will be fixed, or will no longer be a problem."
StLouisRams,337cii,m_fromm,3,Mon Apr 20 06:12:21 2015 UTC,"I would personally be stoked if we took him in the 2nd round.  It's a high risk, high reward pick. The character concerns are real but getting a top 5 talent in the 2nd round might just be worth the risk."
StLouisRams,337cii,RodHardStaff,6,Mon Apr 20 07:17:13 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of Lawrence Philips being touted as ""high risk, high reward""... While I wish all the best for DGB getting his life together, I don't think it's in the Rams' best interests to provide this kid a few million dollars, make him somewhat famous, and hope that he's matured enough to handle it all."
StLouisRams,337cii,SoulardSTL,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:14:09 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with giving people a second, maybe even a third chance, but at some point, if you can't get your life together long enough to be a guaranteed top 10 pick, there's something wrong with you."
StLouisRams,337cii,Sinisterminister77,0,Wed Apr 22 15:14:26 2015 UTC,DGB won't kill his inmate.  Phillips was literally insane.  DGB is just immature.
StLouisRams,337cii,Dave_the_lighting_gu,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:35:26 2015 UTC,I would just love to have an athletic high profile receiver.  DGB can do nothing for 3 seasons but eventually he will tie together a few 1000 yard seasons before his career is done with.  It may end up that it is in the CFL due to his immaturity.
StLouisRams,337cii,the_logistician,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"No, because having watch him at MU, I don't think he's particularly good.  Athletically gifted to be sure, but not bright enough to run routes properly. If he can't do that in college, how can he do it in the NFL?"

StLouisRams,334lzm,chemicalpoisons,3,Sun Apr 19 20:17:06 2015 UTC,Reading this is like going down memory lane. I haven't thought about a lot of these guys for a long time.  I think my favorite one would have been Grant Wistrom.

StLouisRams,332zma,vanlefty,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:16:40 2015 UTC,How can you expect 1200 yards from a receiver who's career high is 775 in a season?
StLouisRams,332zma,pmartin1707,2,Sun Apr 19 07:20:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't wager more than beer on it to be honest.  I'm just pulling out my inner fantasy predictor skillz.  Heres my throught process: he's the #1, second year in the offense, potentially descent qb play, a running game to keep defenses honest,  own team defense keeps them in the game, and he has the skill set.   Granted we play good defenses regularly, likely to not be a involved in many shoot outs, and he hasn't done it yet in his career.   I guess I expect descent qb stats and I can't see a better candidate for a #1 wr.  What do you think?"
StLouisRams,332zma,vanlefty,2,Sun Apr 19 07:32:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will be the number 1 option next season.  There is a decent chance we could grab a #1 threat WR in the first round of the draft, and even if we don't, I expect Brian Quick to be the main receiver threat coming out of training camp considering how he was playing last year, assuming he comes back from his injury strong.  Also, Tavon will be there to take away touches from Britt and also expect the Studman to get subbed in on a regular basis as well.  I think 600-700 yards with 5 touchdowns is a reasonable expectation for Kenny Britt this season."
StLouisRams,332zma,pmartin1707,3,Sun Apr 19 17:35:58 2015 UTC,I think all of our receivers are close enough in talent level to the point we won't have a standout receiver. I really want Stedman Bailey to improve on what he did last year and for Tavon to be more of an offensive weapon.
StLouisRams,332zma,StoneyMcBakerson,1 point,Sun Apr 19 12:57:13 2015 UTC,I think he will have about the same season as last year. I have a feeling fisher is going to run the ball a lot next year.
StLouisRams,331utc,BrawndoTTM,5,Sat Apr 18 18:34:47 2015 UTC,Average to below average center. Semi decent guard. Not a big deal.
StLouisRams,331utc,MaceWindude,7,Sat Apr 18 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"Upgrade over Davin Joseph, not enough of an upgrade over Wells for me to care.

StLouisRams,331utc,m_fromm,4,Sat Apr 18 20:50:00 2015 UTC,I don't know why we keep making this a big deal. We will settle this with this coming draft. It's pretty damn deep with interior line

Even though he's been very healthy in his career I'd be hesitant to sign more 30 year olds and depend on them to be starters on the OLine. If we sign him as depth maybe. Although we have 3 centers on the roster right now in Barnes, Jones and Rhaney. It wouldn't shock me if Jones and Rhaney battle it out for the starting job and any free agents we sign would be at the Guard or Tackle spots."
StLouisRams,3318lg,bozo7337,2,Sat Apr 18 15:30:22 2015 UTC,"I think this is something we will solve in the draft if need be. If we decide to trade back, Cam Erving could be a likely selection.

StLouisRams,32ue7s,bozo7337,7,Thu Apr 16 20:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yesterday, Eric Grubman was interviewed by 1090AM in San Diego. During the interview, he apparently stated that, of the 3 teams potentially relocating to LA, only Saint Louis has delivered with a clear financing plan for a new stadium."

StLouisRams,32ue7s,bozo7337,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:01:16 2015 UTC,"Largely spot-on.   Oakland has broad stroke schematics for Coliseum City, with some preliminary designs out there. But, there are no final designs; no feedback. let alone any commitment, from anticipated partners the Oakland A's & Golden State Warriors, both of which had talked of exiting Oakland previously; and only a partial clue on financing, which would have backing by a hedge fund, while also needing considerable public contributions ($100MM+ for infrastructure alone).   Meanwhile, San Diego has nothing for design other than a concept piece put together by a city alderman, which is commendable and looks great politically, but is a nonviable option. There's also schematics put together by the Chargers organization for a Downtown San Diego stadium, but the City of SD wants this in Mission Valley, not Downtown. They're anticipating an election in November 2016 for public funding for a stadium, likely a year after the League's final decision. From what I've read in local & national media, the San Diego Task Force looks to be little more than political cover, as their current, relatively new administration is dealing with a 15-year-old problem that's just now come to a head."
StLouisRams,32ue7s,D9-EM,-11,Fri Apr 17 15:28:29 2015 UTC,Oh? Financing is still set without a commitment from the Rams? And is that before the city and county sue itself a few times?

StLouisRams,32ue7s,D9-EM,2,Thu Apr 16 23:36:00 2015 UTC,"Just watch that she doesn't post a picture of your ass on the internet, too."
StLouisRams,32ue7s,D9-EM,11,Thu Apr 16 23:50:13 2015 UTC,Our lust knows no bounds.
StLouisRams,32ue7s,bozo7337,-6,Thu Apr 16 23:54:45 2015 UTC,"Let's not forget that stan is paying for everything in Inglewood. I guess since that is already being paid for and the others are still waiting for funds, they are really only speaking to the two stadium ideas."
StLouisRams,32ue7s,Kaos047,5,Thu Apr 16 22:19:20 2015 UTC,He was referring to the three teams home markets. Not Inglewood & Carson CA.
StLouisRams,32ue7s,D9-EM,10,Thu Apr 16 23:06:35 2015 UTC,"Happy to see the task force pressing on. As long as they keep the effort up, we've got a chance. Perhaps we'll get more of the financing details after the meeting."
StLouisRams,32ue7s,bozo7337,-3,Thu Apr 16 20:20:43 2015 UTC,It's kind of funny D9 that you get upvoted for pointing out the St Louis plans need financing details. I get downvoted for pointing out the St Louis plan needs financing details. That it's unclear because they have no financial endorsement from Stan and the city and the new stadiums owners are going to sue each other.
StLouisRams,32ue7s,Kaos047,4,Fri Apr 17 19:12:45 2015 UTC,"Oh? Financing is still set without a commitment from the Rams? And is that before the city and county sue itself a few times?   The difference is you do it in a sarcastic manor while trying to take shots at STL as well. You have a serious persecution complex. You get down voted because you are a sarcastic asshole and toxic towards anything considered good news for STL keeping the Rams.  Just look at your other comment   Maybe he'll have some financing issues resolved. It's all well and good to have drawings and plans but if you have no idea how you're going to pay for it they're just pretty pictures.   Not sarcastic just stating the facts and guess what, its at +7 even though some of it is conjecture and not hard facts."
StLouisRams,32ue7s,D9-EM,3,Fri Apr 17 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I completely agree.  It's more about the approach then what city you live in."
StLouisRams,32ue7s,bozo7337,-1,Fri Apr 17 20:17:21 2015 UTC,I said the same thing in two posts. One was more detailed about the city and the cvc suing each other and having no commitment from Stan. One you deem sarcastic one you deem stating hard facts both saying the same thing. You take offense to one but not the other. You judge people based on your perception of what they're saying.
StLouisRams,32ue7s,D9-EM,3,Fri Apr 17 20:22:46 2015 UTC,The fact that you cant tell the difference between the two is very telling... There is no point in wasting my time trying to explain to you why you are so heavily downvoted ALL the time.
StLouisRams,32ue7s,Kaos047,0,Fri Apr 17 21:43:39 2015 UTC,Your comment below is currently in the positive. And that includes my upvote from yesterday. I don't see what you're getting at.
StLouisRams,32ue7s,DeniseDeNephew,-3,Fri Apr 17 20:14:35 2015 UTC,"One I just stated they had to clear up financing. The other I'm responding to somebody claiming ""only St Louis has clear financing set up of the stadium plans"". I point out there is no commitment from Stan and the city and stadium owners are suing each other about the financing plan and I get down voted. Even comment pointing out that financing is unclear, the one we're replying to, is getting down voted because it's a truthful assessment of the proposals financing."
StLouisRams,32ue7s,bwc_28,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:26:47 2015 UTC,How many times do you and your bros need to point out the samething? Everytime the task force makes progress you guys show up to bring us down. WE KNOW there are roadblocks. WE KNOW it's gonna be a bumpy ride. At this point its rude.
StLouisRams,32ue7s,Minnesota_Slim,5,Fri Apr 17 21:05:08 2015 UTC,Its almost like he has to convince himself every time good news come out of the STL side that its a bunch of crap. The way he talks you would think he can see the future and KNOWS that Rams are moving to LA. I'm tired of people trying to make this a STL vs LA issue when its just assholes being assholes.
StLouisRams,32ue7s,eight26,6,Fri Apr 17 21:46:12 2015 UTC,"The move issue is so tainted by bias that everyone sees every piece of news in their own way.   One group will see this headline and think, ""What a slap in the face of St. Louis.  The NFL couldn't even be bothered to fly reps out to meet with the consultants they hired."" The other group will think, ""Look at all the respect the NFL is showing to our Task Force!  They're getting the royal treatment!  A red carpet invitation!""   Meanwhile none of us knows the truth, which is probably somewhere in the middle of these two extremes.    But as a side note I am tired of the continual, ""I wish the LA assholes would stop being assholes while our side is being so polite"" talk around here.  This sub is being dragged down by what I can only hope are children.  New mods?  So what?  The same immaturity continues.  Name-calling has turned the stltoday.com forum (and by association, our entire fanbase) into a laughingstock and the same thing is happening here.    Now watch the ""not assholes"" of this sub downvote this like they do everything else that they don't like to read.  It's ok boys, I've got karma to spare."
StLouisRams,32tnsn,iamlogan,6,Thu Apr 16 16:57:22 2015 UTC,Hmm. It seems pretty split. How about just make a Blues flair for fans to use temporarily if need be?

StLouisRams,32tnsn,bwc_28,-6,Thu Apr 16 21:17:49 2015 UTC,And the Stl area fans wonder why the fans outside of Stl question the loyalty of the fans.. I don't see the cards or blues subreddit supporting the Rams in the offseason by changing sidebar images.
StLouisRams,32tnsn,cshay33,2,Fri Apr 17 14:17:28 2015 UTC,They aren't questioning the loyalty of Rams fans due to a lack of support on internet forums.
StLouisRams,32tnsn,bluemandan,8,Fri Apr 17 20:25:20 2015 UTC,But most are. Would it really offend people that much?
StLouisRams,32tnsn,genericpoop,3,Thu Apr 16 23:04:07 2015 UTC,It feels like something more appropriate at r/StLouis than here.
StLouisRams,32tnsn,SoulardSTL,8,Thu Apr 16 17:13:38 2015 UTC,Mutually appropriate.
StLouisRams,32tnsn,bwc_28,-6,Thu Apr 16 19:53:32 2015 UTC,Agreed
StLouisRams,32tnsn,Thonked,2,Thu Apr 16 17:21:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but the sub is called StLouisRams, not just Rams."
StLouisRams,32tnsn,bozo7337,-2,Thu Apr 16 18:49:35 2015 UTC,And not StLouisBlues either.
StLouisRams,32tnsn,D9-EM,10,Thu Apr 16 19:11:29 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with showing support for the other teams in the Rams home market. it's completely appropriate. (I'm not downvoting you btw)
StLouisRams,32tnsn,bozo7337,-3,Thu Apr 16 19:57:56 2015 UTC,I agree but would they put up a banner supporting the LA Kings if they were making a playoff run? Probably as many Kings fans as Blues fans in here same with Dodgers and Cardinals. I look at it as yet more provoking the other part of the Rams fan base. And as we've seen with those charts in /r/NFL the Rams are one of the smallest followings on reddit. People probably see all the fighting and don't want to get involved with us.  I don't worry about the down votes. There are some of us that aren't anti Kroenke and welcome a return to LA so no matter what we say it gets down voted hehe
StLouisRams,32tnsn,SoulardSTL,9,Thu Apr 16 20:08:42 2015 UTC,"Dude, they're the Saint Louis Rams. Today, they are not the Los Angeles Rams. If in the future they become the LA Rams, then by all means put up banners supporting the Kings, or Dodgers, or Lakers, or whoever at that time. But, don't get upset that people in /r/stlouisrams support the Saint Louis Blues. We support our teams in STL, especially when they make the playoffs. LET'S GO BLUES!!!!"
StLouisRams,32tnsn,bwc_28,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"There's an attitude here that everyone should be St Louis fans and everyone automatically supports St Louis teams. The reality is that the Rams have fans across the country and world. Rams fans support a variety of hockey teams from a bunch of markets. There are Sharks fans, Kings fans, Wild fans, and yes Blues fans. If the Rams themselves want to celebrate the Blues making the playoffs, great, I have no issue with that. But your attitude purposefully ignores all the fans of the team outside of St Louis, even the ones who don't support LA teams."
StLouisRams,32tnsn,SoulardSTL,2,Thu Apr 16 21:15:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe that attitude exists here because it's the Saint Louis Rams thread, not the LA Rams thread.   Por ejemplo: I'm a Bulls fan, and I wouldn't object to the Bulls banner celebrating the hated Cubs making the playoffs. Because that's a Chicago thing. This is a Saint Louis thing. They're still the Saint Louis Rams. Join us in cheering, or don't, but don't object to us cheering."
StLouisRams,32tnsn,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,4,Thu Apr 16 23:02:28 2015 UTC,You are missing the point. St Louis is the location rams is what they are. This is a football sports group. If you want to support the blues then make a subreddit for them if there isn't one. At least half of the fans on this sub aren't from stl. I don't really care about hockey but to act like everyone here supports the blues and are from St.Louis is wrong.
StLouisRams,32tnsn,bwc_28,0,Fri Apr 17 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"I cheer for the Rams, and this is the Rams subreddit. As I said in another post I won't be offended if the Rams post something supporting the Blues. But this is a Rams subreddit, for all Rams fans. This isn't a subreddit solely for Rams fans based in St Louis.  I love that you paint this as an LA vs St Louis thing when it's not. I don't root for any LA teams, I hate most of them. But fans like you refuse to be respectful to the plethora of Rams fans who support teams outside of St Louis. You say this is a St Louis subreddit, ignoring the fans in other markets. Don't act like you're the only demographic that matters, it just drives home how disrespectful you're being. The downvotes and your attitude are ridiculous. It's no wonder this subreddit has gone completely to hell."
StLouisRams,32tnsn,bozo7337,0,Thu Apr 16 23:20:34 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I said it's the Rams sub not the Blues sub. People in here support many NHL teams not just the Blues or Kings.
StLouisRams,32tnsn,SoulardSTL,-2,Thu Apr 16 20:54:51 2015 UTC,"If the Dodgers put up a Kings banner, wouldn't that be comparable? Oh wait, the Kings aren't in the playoffs, that's right... What about the Mighty Ducks? I wouldn't mind the Dodgers thread putting them up. Feel free to cheer for them on the Lakers site, too. Here, we bleed blue."
StLouisRams,32tnsn,bwc_28,0,Thu Apr 16 22:59:12 2015 UTC,As someone who despises the Kings you're really being an ass in this thread. What's the point of purposefully antagonizing anyone who doesn't live in your city? Why can't you be at least somewhat respectful?

StLouisRams,32tnsn,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,-2,Fri Apr 17 20:23:47 2015 UTC,Can we get an Arizona Rattlers or a Steph Curry banner as well? I would like to feel a part of this sub with the people that are from St.Louis.

StLouisRams,32udvc,SoulardSTL,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"This is because Kroenke can start building in December, so they will decide before that.  Does the NFL expect Kroenke to comply with the decision that will be made? Or do they know they can't (or don't want to) stop him and are doing this to continue to show control over the process.  For what it's worth, the task force in San Diego has said that they don't view Carson as the real threat, but the notion that the Bolts could share the new digs with the Rams."
StLouisRams,32udvc,Seductive_Santa,-5,Fri Apr 17 04:10:43 2015 UTC,"Generally, I would think the NFL would hope its franchisees follow the organization's rules, including such a ruling. Otherwise, it's chaos. I don't think this is Kabuki Theater inside the owners meetings…   My thoughts are more on the financing for a possible Chargers move to LA. I think the Carson possibility is more real than most expect. The most powerful player at the table is Goldman Sachs, who can fund relocation and even suffer losses for both the Chargers and the Raiders as they establish themselves in Carson. Plus, with how much disdain there is within the Spanos family for Kroenke, I think they'd pursue single-tenancy in Carson before being tenants in Inglewood, and the Raiders have already stated they’d go with Carson before Inglewood. Here’s where Goldman Sachs' pull could really have the upper hand, making Carson viable as either single-tenant or double-tenant. And yes, lots of variables here.   Not wishful thinking, but I really think the Rams are the least likely franchise to move. From what I've read in the public news, Oakland isn't 100% sure how to get going with Coliseum City; there’s been absolutely no love from either the A's or Warriors for it. An Oakland official was quoted yesterday saying this could be an opportunity for the NFL to help re-create the City of Oakland, which is ominous to the NFL as it’s just a sports league, not a social agency. That statement just screams risk. Meanwhile, San Diego is much farther behind, just agreeing now that they should hire lawyers to work on preliminary terms, maybe an architect someday soon. San Diego's Mayor wants a vote on the stadium in November 2016, likely a year after a decision is made. Perhaps most importantly, the NFL has said they would not want to pursue new stadium developments founded on ancillary real estate developments, largely out of the needs for entitlements on future developments inherent in such large scale shared projects. Or, they don't want to have a stadium be part of a larger real estate development (mixed-use communities, live/work/play/NFL) because of time delays and (I believe Grubman said) having more mouths to feed.       Note: I'm not counting Inglewood's mixed-use nature as comparable to the preliminary ideas in either Oakland or San Diego because Inglewood hasn't been called out by the NFL. I'd think they've already squared out all issues involving internal cross-party capital allocations, as well as the role of any (if any) public infrastructure development costs ahead of going public. Far as I know, they're tip top. But, I don’t know if the Chargers would join them in Inglewood. If the Chargers stay in San Diego, I could see the Raiders signing on to Inglewood rather than going it alone, but I think that’s less likely than the LA Chargers coming into being in Carson."
StLouisRams,32udvc,DeniseDeNephew,-4,Fri Apr 17 15:14:36 2015 UTC,"The big question becomes: If the relocation vote takes place during the playoffs, how much more important does it become for the Rams, Chargers, and Raiders to make it into the playoffs this year? And, what if the Rams, Chargers, or Raiders are not only in the playoffs, but host to playoff games when the votes are made? Say one of these teams is due to host a playoff game (least likely Oakland) and find out that they'll lose their team to relocation the week before their game... How bad would it look for the NFL to see a playoff game's home crowd either not show up or be openly rebellious to the League during the game?"
StLouisRams,32sxgp,xKeyNin,15,Thu Apr 16 13:33:55 2015 UTC,The same group worked out Grayson and will work out Petty on Saturday. This really shouldn't shock anybody.
StLouisRams,32sxgp,bozo7337,2,Thu Apr 16 14:34:53 2015 UTC,I think more than anything it just reiterates how serious they are about taking a QB this draft. We should entertain the option of Mariota dropping to us or being able to trade up for a sweet deal. These guys will be available in the 4th round and I think well take one there.
StLouisRams,32sxgp,Thonked,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:19:45 2015 UTC,I agree QB is a focus. I think though that Grayson petty and Hundley are gone by the end of the 2nd round.
StLouisRams,32sxgp,bozo7337,0,Thu Apr 16 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure, I think they scored too low in the combine to go before the third round. I could see some teams going for them in the third but I have a feeling some of them fall to the 4th. I'd like to get one of them to at least groom behind Foles if we dont get Mariota."
StLouisRams,32sxgp,Thonked,3,Thu Apr 16 18:47:40 2015 UTC,Combine means jack. The underwear olympics count for a lot less than what a guy has done on the field.
StLouisRams,32sxgp,bozo7337,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:12:42 2015 UTC,"Why exactly would we need to ""groom"" somebody behind a 26 year old QB?"
StLouisRams,32sxgp,Ihateunerds,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:51:18 2015 UTC,"The transition to the NFL is difficult on many quarterbacks.  It sometimes helps them to be groomed behind someone so that they are able to mature to the level before they are out on the field.  For example, if Mariota were to go out as a rookie and have a terrible year because he wasn't ready yet, it can hinder his career path by either deflating the confidence he needs to succeed or having his team / coaches lose faith in him.  If he is given a year to develop behind someone and learn the differences of playing in the NFL and learning the new playbook, he will likely come into the game with more confidence and experience.  I am not saying that would happen, just an example."
StLouisRams,32sxgp,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:31:59 2015 UTC,"That's not really true, just about every good starter in the NFL nowadays starts their rookie season. Drafting a QB at ten overall would be about the dumbest move the Rams could make this draft.  Especially considering the trade haul we could get if Mariota is still on the board at ten.  And you didn't even answer my question of why we would need to groom anybody when we have a proven 26 year old already."
StLouisRams,32sxgp,Ihateunerds,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"I don't want us to get Mariota because I am content with Foles and I believe that taking Mariota will make him feel like we are only going to keep him around for a year. I want Foles to feel that if he performs well for us, he has a place on our team. I was just explaining why Mariota might possibly benefit from a year of grooming."
StLouisRams,32sxgp,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:42:31 2015 UTC,I can't believe a rams fan said this after dealing with Bradford the last few seasons.
StLouisRams,32sxgp,RamsWillFly,1 point,Thu Apr 16 22:56:53 2015 UTC,"If your starting QB goes down you're fucked anyway. There isn't a backup in the league that is going to take you to the playoffs. We have our guy. You build a team around him and roll the dice that he stays healthy. If Mariota falls to us at ten I'd be ecstatic, especially if the other guys we actually need like Cooper, White, Scherff are gone. Because then we could trade down for a haul. Taking someone 10th overall who you project as a backup would be colossally stupid."
StLouisRams,32sxgp,Ihateunerds,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:01:01 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with taking a QB at 10 but I woudn't really be surprised if they took Maritota if he somehow ends up there. I highly doubt he will be and that's why i'm even saying this.  Say Foles gets injured and just isn't that good as we thought he could be. If we wanted him next season we would have to sign him for a pretty decent sized contract. We probably wouldn't want to keep him if that was the case so Mariota is a nice safety net. Would be sweet to have a Young,athletic,smart QB with a very High ceiling that would also be a-lot cheaper than Foles next season."
StLouisRams,32sxgp,RamsWillFly,7,Fri Apr 17 04:27:25 2015 UTC,"I usually hate these kind of stories as every team does due diligence, but sending that many high-ranking staff members (who are probably busy as fuck this time of year) means genuine interest."
StLouisRams,32sxgp,BrawndoTTM,3,Thu Apr 16 14:18:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me too. It would be dumb to not scout as many good players as possible.  But to send damn near the whole front office and then some? Damn."
StLouisRams,32sxgp,ImTheBestMayne,4,Thu Apr 16 14:22:13 2015 UTC,"I am completely ok with us taking Mariota if he's somehow still there at 10, if Foles works out then we resign him and have a potential trade piece, and if he doesn't work out he only has 1 year left on his contract and we roll with Mariota"
StLouisRams,32sxgp,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what do you think of us trading up for Mariota?"
StLouisRams,32sxgp,ImTheBestMayne,7,Thu Apr 16 15:19:09 2015 UTC,"I think it would be a bad idea, if he somehow falls to 10 I say we take him but with all of the interest other teams have in him I think it would take way too much to move up."
StLouisRams,32sxgp,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:37:23 2015 UTC,That's kind of what I think too. We would have to give up quite a bit for him.
StLouisRams,32sxgp,bozo7337,2,Thu Apr 16 16:02:01 2015 UTC,I'd rather trade back in the first and pick up an extra 2nd. Then use a 2nd on Grayson.

If they trade down early, which you guys always do, maybe you acquire another pick. Maybe he slips. Maybe he goes early because QB's are in the highest demand. Nobody knows.   Besides, a workout has never been even a slight indicator of the teams real coveted players. Would wait my dude."

We also have a limited selection of picks, I believe the fewest of all teams, which means the front office can't afford to do much reaching.  The Rams front office is super BPA oriented; if they want a QB (which is clearly in the cards), they won't be reaching.  But maybe they have Petty ranked higher or lower than I do, who knows."

StLouisRams,32hrcc,FanFuckingFaptastic,7,Tue Apr 14 17:57:41 2015 UTC,"I'll go a step further and say it's a complete lie.  The NFL is a business and their primary motivation is profit and all the talk about communities is as genuine as it is in those Exxon and BP commercials.  It's the lie they want us to believe.  What Goodell means when he says he wants franchises to stay in their cities is that he wants those cities to spend public money on stadiums.  Goodell is the 'good cop' in the good cop/bad cop ploy.  The team owner says he'll move if the city doesn't build him a stadium (bad cop) and then Goodell says gee whiz it would be a shame if the city lost an NFL franchise  because they didn't build a new stadium even though you deserve to have a team and we would hate to see the team leave (good cop).  Both are saying ""cough up the cash and build us a stadium"" but one tries to make it sound caring.  Give us 350 million dollars, it's for your own good.  But is Peacock any less disingenuous?   Unless something happened today that I haven't heard about yet he doesn't have any private financing lined up.  But every few days he makes vaguely positive statements like, ""We're weighing all our options"" or ""we're making daily progress"" without actually showing us anything.  His words mean nothing, it's like listening to a bad politician, but instead of asking for answers he's being praised by fans for :not tipping his hand"" and ""keeping things close to the vest -- smart!"" but what could he possibly have to gain by keeping all this supposed private money a secret?  Why not let people in the Show Me State know and get the public pumped up?   Instead we get day after day of lofty promises without anything concrete to back them up.  It's vaporware.  Does Peacock only get paid if he succeeds or is he already drawing a salary as a paid consultant?   Anyone who had worked with consultants knows that most will milk a job for every dollar they can squeeze out of it, is that what Peacock is doing with all this, ""Progress is being made, take my word for it"" talk?  The NFL, Kroenke, and Peacock are all going to make a lot of money from this possible move and I wouldn't take anything any of them say at face value.  They all have a finger in this pie."

StLouisRams,32gvxj,FaulktheBlueRedbird,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:43:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's better than White and Cooper, I just like him best. I think he will develop into an Anquan Boldin clone. If we could get him in the 2nd from a pick we got trading down in the first, I would be happy."
StLouisRams,32gvxj,FaulktheBlueRedbird,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:37:28 2015 UTC,Trae Waynes would be my favorite pick at number 10.
StLouisRams,32gvxj,FaulktheBlueRedbird,2,Mon Apr 13 18:52:47 2015 UTC,He would be awesome to have but it would assure that we will be picking at the 10th overall range again next year I believe.
StLouisRams,32gvxj,FaulktheBlueRedbird,3,Mon Apr 13 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"Our season absolutley does not rest on our #10 overall pick. Even if we get Scherff, he'll be a rookie and he's pretty raw. There are a lot of O-Lineman in this draft.   I don't think picking a rookie in a weak class of O-Lineman at 10, whoever it may be, is going to dramatically change our season."
StLouisRams,32gvxj,The49ersBlow,3,Mon Apr 13 19:41:42 2015 UTC,I think that starting Scherff at RG is a big difference from starting Ali Marpet at RG Week 1. Marpet is projected 2nd round and played at what a d2 school? He isnt week 1 ready and is automatically ranked 32nd.
StLouisRams,32gvxj,BilllyMayes,3,Mon Apr 13 19:45:58 2015 UTC,"First of all, I'm not downvoting you and I don't know who the fuck is for your totally reasonable opinions, but that's really annoying. For that, I'm sorry. Just upvoted all of your comments to even it out. Meh.   Anyway, Sherff isn't even close in physical ability to Robinson and Robinson didn't even start until week 5 or become an asset until the end of the season. I just don't see Scherff magically fixing anything. If we 1) re-sign Barksdale and pick up 2-3 O-Lineman and see who pans out in training camp or 2) resign Barksdale and take Scherff, I don't much of a difference."
StLouisRams,32gvxj,The49ersBlow,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:39:39 2015 UTC,"The difference between the two though are pretty large. Robinson is way more physically talented than Scherff but Robinson is playing left tackle not right guard. Apparently guard is way easier. Also Robinson never had to do pass protection so he had to learn it all. Scherff has been asked to do pass protection before and has more experience. I think by week 5 Scherff would definitely be starter ready, but Robinson will peak higher."
StLouisRams,32gvxj,LLv2,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"I don't really disagree what you're saying. Guard is an easier position. That's why I think we'd be fine in the later rounds. LT or RT is definitely something to pick for in the 1st round if it's a huge need. But Guard... I just don't think we need to reach for Scherff at #10.   Regardless, I'll be stoked if we get him."
StLouisRams,32gvxj,Demonthehusky,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:12:52 2015 UTC,That's why id prefer to trade down and pick Peat to play RT.
StLouisRams,32gvxj,Demonthehusky,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:20:45 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. Not a bad move.   The reason I'm behind the Waynes pick is because I think two more secondary pieces could make us a top 3 defense. We came off the last 9 games of last year with Greg Williams leading an incredible unit, averaging 15 points allowed per game. Now we've added Akeem Ayers updating the LB position and put Fairley into the DL rotation. Plus Gaines was filling a huge hole by the end of last year.   Plug in Waynes into the other starting CB position and I don't know what holes we really have. It could be something incredible."
StLouisRams,32gvxj,MathBeaudet,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:26:03 2015 UTC,"Waynes is crazy talented I agree, but I think the fan hate on Jenkins is too harsh. Jenkins for most of the season was our best tackler. His coverage is nothing to shoot at either. If he were a free agent this year he would have been snatched up within the first hour. I like jenks, he's good in coverage and takes chances. Id rather have that than a cb that is never mentioned because his highlight in a game is getting beat. Everyone gets beat. But to get as many pick 6's as jenks has is something special. Plus we are yet to see what Joyner is going to be. Waynes would be cool as hell to have though. Put jenks or gaines in the slot."
StLouisRams,32didp,sir_nigel_loring,13,Sun Apr 12 22:00:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly it might make them even more susceptible to a move. The hardest part of relocating a franchise is building the fan base. How are you gonna convert people living in LA who are already fans of other teams? Moving a fucking championship team helps.   Look how welcomed the Thunder have been in OKC. Is it because OKC is just a basketball mecca? Or because the Thunder are one of the best teams? Now think about it in this situation: if you were living in LA, would you be more likely to become a Rams fan if the lol ""gonna be scary"" rams from the last decade moved there or if the Super Bowl Champions moved there?"
StLouisRams,32didp,diesel321,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:13:15 2015 UTC,Let the moral dilemma ensue
StLouisRams,32didp,Thonked,-1,Thu Apr 16 18:44:04 2015 UTC,FYI OKC is not in the playoffs.
StLouisRams,32didp,SoulardSTL,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:55:34 2015 UTC,How is that relevant
StLouisRams,32didp,diesel321,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:30:50 2015 UTC,"As an FYI. You talked about the OKC Thunder's popularity being in part due to their being one of the best teams. This year, they're not in the playoffs, and ostensibly not one of the best teams. That's all I'm point out to you here. Thanks for the downvote."
StLouisRams,32didp,SoulardSTL,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"I downvoted your comment because it was so stupid and irrelevant. You realize they moved after 2008? Missing the playoffs this season, especially when it was 100% because of injuries, is entirely irrelevant."
StLouisRams,32didp,diesel321,28,Thu Apr 16 22:12:14 2015 UTC,"No, it does not. Contrary to popular belief, the Rams are not (potentially) moving because of fan loyalty. We sold 87.3% of our seats last year, despite a decade of losing and constant threats of relocation. We have a much more advanced stadium plan than either San Diego or Oakland in the works.    Even if we were a great team for the past few years and we sold, let's say, 95% of our seats, that 6.7% difference in attendance sure as hell wouldn't be influencing Kroenke's decision.   What are the figures? He doubles, triples the value of the Rams simply by moving to L.A.? The market is enormous. This isn't about fan loyalty. It's about the bottom line. It's about a businessman making a business decision: do I sell my product to a small market or to the second largest market in the Western Hemisphere?   It sucks, but that's all it is or ever was."
StLouisRams,32didp,FaulktheBlueRedbird,15,Sun Apr 12 22:16:46 2015 UTC,"We sold 87.3% of our seats last year   Which was middle of the road in percentage capacity but second to last in actual attendance numbers. I've been seeing people recently toting the seat percentage numbers as if they're a positive, which simply isn't the case.  Edit: to the people downvoting, you're the reason we need a stickied stadium thread. People like you make this sub a joke."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,3,Sun Apr 12 22:40:23 2015 UTC,If you don't think that's a positive I dunno what to tell you. It shows an insane amount of fan loyalty when compared the the historic ineptitude of the product we were paying for.
StLouisRams,32didp,crackalac,0,Mon Apr 13 14:58:17 2015 UTC,Because the total attendance numbers have been toward the bottom of the league for a while. When you focus on just one statistic without any context it doesn't give the whole story. I'm just trying to show people that there's more to it than just the one number posted above. But people will see whatever they want and ignore the rest of the story that doesn't fit their narrative.
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,2,Mon Apr 13 18:13:39 2015 UTC,So basically your whole argument is that our market doesn't deserve a team due to its size.
StLouisRams,32didp,crackalac,0,Tue Apr 14 02:16:12 2015 UTC,Not at all.
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,2,Tue Apr 14 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"Selling to the capacity that we do, you point to the total number of seats. I'd have to imagine the size of the stadium the nfl builds is correlated in some way to how many they think a market can fill."
StLouisRams,32didp,crackalac,0,Tue Apr 14 02:23:40 2015 UTC,"Of course, but most stadiums in very diverse markets seat about the same number of fans. There are teams in smaller markets with better overall attendance. You're going to believe whatever you want though, so this is pointless."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,2,Tue Apr 14 02:28:01 2015 UTC,"I guess. To me it shows that when times are terrible, we still generally come out. I wonder what the delta is between a good team in LA vs a bad team in LA attendance wise."
StLouisRams,32didp,crackalac,1 point,Tue Apr 14 04:00:20 2015 UTC,"Well during the 50s when the team wasn't good at all the Rams were still top in attendance. It wasn't until they moved to Anaheim that they regularly had below average attendance. In fact in the 43 years the Rams were in LA they had below average attendance only four seasons. They regularly had 10,000-20,000 more fans per game throughout their time in LA."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,3,Tue Apr 14 04:12:48 2015 UTC,"Yes and they couldn't get over 65% over capacity in Anaheim. Over 20% worse than the worst attendance in the NFL today.  I know Anaheim isn't technically Los Angeles, but considering it was a 40 minute drive from the old L.A. stadium, I don't see much of a difference there. I highly doubt moving the Rams to a suburban stadium location outside of St. Louis would have attendance drop to 65%. Can't even imagine numbers that low."
StLouisRams,32didp,FaulktheBlueRedbird,7,Sun Apr 12 23:10:23 2015 UTC,"You're seriously looking at attendance for ONLY the season the Rams had announced they were moving to St Louis... They had over 80% attendance most seasons in Anaheim. Attendance didn't drop until it was obvious the team was moving, the final three years. But in LA the Rams always had very good attendance, the only time they dropped in the total attendance rankings was when bigger stadiums were built around the league.  Considering how abysmal support has been for the team recently I can easily see attendance in the last season in St Louis (if it's announced they're moving before the season like what happened in Anaheim) hitting below 60%."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,6,Sun Apr 12 23:23:34 2015 UTC,"They failed to reach above 70% 75% for the last four seasons in Anaheim in the second largest market on the planet. You cannot get past these numbers haha. Four straight years of sub-70% sub-75% attendance is insanely bad.   It's ""obvious"" they're moving now, and Rams season tickets have increased in St. Louis this year. We have attendance some 20% higher than Los Angeles/Anaheim under threat of leaving with a fraction of the market size. I don't know why we keep arguing numbers. There is no opinion here, there are facts.   http://losangelesrams.org/about/statistics/attendance.html"
StLouisRams,32didp,FaulktheBlueRedbird,2,Sun Apr 12 23:32:08 2015 UTC,"in the second largest market on the planet.   Los Angeles is nowhere near being the second largest market in the planet. Off the top of my head Tokyo, Mexico City, New Dehli, Beijing... they're all way bigger than even New York."
StLouisRams,32didp,GreatestDenier,2,Mon Apr 13 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"Market =/ population.   Tokyo would be a larger market than L.A. but I highly doubt that Mexico City, New Dehli, and Beijing have anywhere close to the spending power per capita that L.A. has. I guess if you want to say largest in the Western Hemisphere that would work, but my point still stands."
StLouisRams,32didp,FaulktheBlueRedbird,0,Mon Apr 13 19:35:43 2015 UTC,"They failed to reach above 70% for the last four seasons in Anaheim   They had 75% attendance their fourth to last season in Anaheim. 69,000 capacity and 51,586 attendance, those are facts. 69% the next year, 65.7% next year, and 62% their last year in Anaheim. Might want to get your facts straight before acting like you know everything. I don't know why we keep arguing numbers when you just make shit up."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,5,Mon Apr 13 00:08:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, I was off by one year. And that one year was still atrocious. Not ""making shit up"" just made a mistake. But thanks for getting those exact percentages for me. It really highlighted my point."
StLouisRams,32didp,FaulktheBlueRedbird,-1,Mon Apr 13 00:11:56 2015 UTC,"The last five years attendance has been a joke in St Louis, you think you're making a point about LA and yet can't post any numbers showing that LA hasn't supported the Rams. You explicityl said LA isn't Anaheim and then proceeded to say the numbers from Anaheim should count toward LA. An hour drive in stop and go traffic is not the same community as much you want it to be to fit your narrative."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:17:02 2015 UTC,Fine. Go look at L.A.'s numbers. 1975 was their best attendance in history at 81% capacity. That's their best. You're calling St. Louis attendance at 87% a joke when the best year in the history of L.A. Ram's football is 6% below that. I don't understand.   I understand that they sold well above average in total ticket sales that year because of the size of their stadium. But I just don't think the second largest market in the USA should be leaving 1 out of every 5 seats empty for their all time best selling season.
StLouisRams,32didp,FaulktheBlueRedbird,4,Mon Apr 13 00:32:28 2015 UTC,"Hahahahaha the Rams played in the Coliseum in LA! Of course they didn't fill the 93,000 seats! 81% capacity of that stadium is 75,000 fans, more than the capacity of the Edward Jones Dome! You keep throwing out percentages and obviously have no idea what you're talking about."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,-1,Mon Apr 13 00:49:48 2015 UTC,You should know by now not to argue facts with people in here. The situations between right now and the last 4 years in Anaheim are so different that unless you were a fan then you won't know it.
StLouisRams,32didp,bozo7337,0,Mon Apr 13 00:12:55 2015 UTC,"Ugh I know. /u/FaulktheBlueRedbird is especially bad. There are some users in here that are just looking for any reason to hate on LA and prove that St Louis is better. The funny thing is I hate LA fans typically, I'm a Sharks and Giants fan. It feels so weird defending LA fans in this sub, but the ignorance from people like the user above me are just astounding. The blind hate toward anyone in LA since the team moved in '95 is just ridiculous."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,4,Mon Apr 13 00:19:14 2015 UTC,I don't live in LA and never have. I have been a Rams fan longer than most people in this sub though. Best thing that can happen is the Rams move and the evil strippers moving them without NFL approval is fixed.

She also didn't move without league approval.  Davis did.  Obviously you haven't been that much of a fan.
StLouisRams,32didp,LLv2,4,Mon Apr 13 02:40:39 2015 UTC,You're the aggressor in the argument above. YOU attacked first. Not sure why you think someone came here to attack LA fans. It's clearly St. Louis fans getting ridiculed.
StLouisRams,32didp,D9-EM,2,Mon Apr 13 00:31:39 2015 UTC,"I pointed out that he was factually incorrect, how does that make me the aggressor? You and others like you downvote any post from people pointing out how patently incorrect the narrative you're trying to push is. Yet somehow you're the one being ridiculed? What a persecution complex you have..."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,0,Mon Apr 13 00:54:36 2015 UTC,"I'll still be a Rams fan if they move. I love this team. But I just think it strange that you keep saying how weak St. Louis attendance is when it has been, from any objective point of view, historically better than Los Angeles by a large margin."
StLouisRams,32didp,FaulktheBlueRedbird,2,Mon Apr 13 00:25:56 2015 UTC,"Not if you actually look at the entire picture instead of the one statistic you keep parroting to which fits your narrative. LA had higher attendance than St Louis, Anaheim was comparable with St Louis up until the team moved. You keep looking for anything to fit into the narrative you want. There's no point talking with you because you never listen, anything that doesn't fit your view is just ignored."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,-2,Mon Apr 13 00:52:40 2015 UTC,"Well if you'd like to go back to the Los Angeles era from 1946-1979, I'm seeing an all time record average attendance at 75,942 which is at 81% capacity.   L.A.'s best turnout in their history would rank 31st in the NFL today."
StLouisRams,32didp,FaulktheBlueRedbird,3,Mon Apr 13 00:23:06 2015 UTC,"You're wrong again. The first pre-season game the Rams played in LA had 95,000 attendance. In the first two years after the Dodgers moved to California, the Rams drew an average of 83,681. The Rams set the all-time NFL attendance record that stood until 2006 and broke the 100,000 mark twice during the 1958 campaign.  That's all straight from their wikipedia page. You are woefully ignorant about the team you root for.  Edit: btw during the 50s and 60s the Rams were drawing anywhere from 10,000 to 40,000 fans more than the league average."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,0,Mon Apr 13 01:07:39 2015 UTC,"http://losangelesrams.org/about/statistics/attendance.html  Are these numbers inaccurate?   Edit: Didn't see the 83,000 year. I stand corrected."

StLouisRams,32didp,Zoloir,0,Mon Apr 13 18:21:27 2015 UTC,In what way is selling 87.3% of seats a negative thing?
StLouisRams,32didp,BeefyMcFlaps,0,Mon Apr 13 03:20:49 2015 UTC,middle of the road in percentage capacity but second to last in actual attendance numbers
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,3,Mon Apr 13 03:22:11 2015 UTC,I feel as though comparing actual seat numbers isn't statistically the best way to compare marketing success. Why would the better marker for success not be the one that is based off the average? Going by average removes the variables of stadium size and market size influencing data.  Edit: Got mixed up when typing.
StLouisRams,32didp,BeefyMcFlaps,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:24:44 2015 UTC,Going by average removes the variables of stadium size and market size influencing data.   It doesn't remove those variables though.
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,3,Mon Apr 13 03:26:46 2015 UTC,"Why not? Success being measured by average percentage of seats sold shows that the market fills this much of their seats. By just saying 65000 vs. 90000, there's no way of knowing whether either of those numbers are good/bad.   Edit: According to Wikipedia, the Rams are 6th from the bottom on expanded seating capacity and 10th from the bottom in regular capacity. This means that even if the Rams filled to capacity, and every other stadium filled to capacity, we would only have the hope of being 27th on the list in seats sold."
StLouisRams,32didp,BeefyMcFlaps,2,Mon Apr 13 03:29:10 2015 UTC,Success being measured by average percentage of seats sold shows that the market fills this much of their seats.   Except when teams like the Rams have to buy out tickets to fill out seats and prevent blackouts. Not exactly the market at work.
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,4,Mon Apr 13 03:51:37 2015 UTC,Is there data on how much was bought out last year? Genuinely curious.
StLouisRams,32didp,BeefyMcFlaps,4,Mon Apr 13 03:57:18 2015 UTC,"Not that I've seen, and I honestly doubt it's more than a few hundred tickets per game at most. I was just pointing out there's things we don't know when it comes to the numbers."
StLouisRams,32didp,bwc_28,6,Mon Apr 13 04:12:21 2015 UTC,About as much it did for Albert Pujols.
StLouisRams,32didp,biergarten,0,Mon Apr 13 01:27:31 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, the Cardinals organization hated Pujols. My dad knows a guy that worked for the Angels at the time of the move and he said the day the contract was signed, they got a message from the Cardinals that said ""Thanks for giving us back our clubhouse."""
StLouisRams,32didp,thatoneguy889,2,Tue Apr 14 18:04:31 2015 UTC,"Either way, it was assumed winning everything  (especially in the fashion they did it in), he would want to stay. It was his call. The Cardinals offered him money."
StLouisRams,32didp,biergarten,0,Tue Apr 14 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"Eh. The contract they offered him wasn't even that competitive and made it seem like they'd take him back, but wouldn't fight for him. Even Pujols himself said that the offer the Cardinals made was ""insulting""."
StLouisRams,32didp,thatoneguy889,2,Tue Apr 14 19:01:14 2015 UTC,He told us it wasn't about money
StLouisRams,32didp,biergarten,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:07:33 2015 UTC,"It's fine. I don't think either side acted in bad faith. The Cardinals wanted to remain in contention. Pujols wanted A-Rod money. Those two things weren't really compatible with each other, so we had to part ways. Four years later, we're still able to go to the NLCS every year, and Pujols is rich as fuck. Good for everyone involved, if you ask me."

StLouisRams,32didp,Seductive_Santa,5,Mon Apr 13 01:34:57 2015 UTC,They would hold the celebratory parade in LA
StLouisRams,32didp,Soaring_Seagull24,2,Sun Apr 12 22:34:53 2015 UTC,At this point nothing is going to prevent them from moving. The super duo came up with some nice drawings and hypothetical plans for financing. But they have no financial backing from the most important person and that's Kroenke. The city wants to sue to make sure there's a vote the CVC wants to sue to make sure there isn't a vote. The people and the politicians in St Louis can't figure things our and by the time they stop fighting and suing each other Kroenke will have presented plans to move to the NFL owners and received the vote he needs while pointing out the mess in St Louis as a prime example on why he should be allowed to move.
StLouisRams,32didp,bozo7337,3,Mon Apr 13 00:16:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Rams side of the financing would be an issue. It will come down to whether or not Kroenke can get 23 owner votes to relocate.  If he can't, I think he sells the team and buys either the Broncos and solves his cross ownership issues or the Raiders and moves them into Inglewood Football Wonderland.  I don't see any scenario playing out where the Rams stay put and Stan remains the owner long term."
StLouisRams,32didp,Ihateunerds,0,Mon Apr 13 09:41:58 2015 UTC,Neither of those scenarios are likely.
StLouisRams,32didp,TheDuke13,-1,Mon Apr 13 12:25:02 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if they win the Super Bowl or not.  What it may do is make St. Louis scrounge up the change to finance the stadium.  Even then nothing is holding the Rams there,   The contract is broken.   As peacock said,  they cannot move forward without team commitment, or financing.  The days in st Louis are numbered."
StLouisRams,32didp,Magnemmike,0,Sun Apr 12 23:48:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like with the immense increase in team popularity that comes from a super bowl win, that the idea of moving the rams would get dropped. It would spike merchandise and ticket sales for the next years, so why move?"
StLouisRams,32didp,GoochMasterFlash,0,Sun Apr 12 22:12:53 2015 UTC,It wouldn't be the money and ticket sales that would save them. They would still make and be worth a crap ton more in LA. It would be the idea of the bad PR repercussions of moving the reigning Super Bowl champs.  But at best I think that might buy them another year here if we're assuming Stan's relocation plan would get approved next offseason if they didn't win the Super Bowl.
StLouisRams,32didp,Ihateunerds,3,Sun Apr 12 23:18:46 2015 UTC,"It would be the idea of the bad PR repercussions of moving the reigning Super Bowl champs   Not taking sides here, but do you really think anyone outside of St. Louis would care?   If Kraft moved the Patriots this year would it change anything for you?  Would you stop going to games?  Stop watching them on TV?  Would you boycott Budweiser, the official beer of the NFL?  Other than Pats fans in New England, who would care?  Beyond that you need to think of the fans that would be gained by a move.  If the Pats moved to London they would lose fans in Massachusetts but gain new fans in London (who would buy much more merch than existing fans).  If it's a net gain then why would the NFL be anything but happy about it?  This is not a moral issue, it's business, and it would be naïve to think otherwise.  I could be wrong though.  Has there been any move in the SB era, SB champ or not, that had a negative impact on the NFL's bottom line?  Let's do single-year and long-term.  My hunch is that the NFL made more money in both scenarios, for any modern move."
StLouisRams,32didp,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:16:50 2015 UTC,"You may be right. I hope we have the chance to find out, that would be awesome.  I just think PR wise for the league, it would look bad.  And I think they are finally starting to realize that they aren't invincible.  Say hypothetically we win the Super Bowl, there's really no harm in just having an agreement that the Rams stay one more year.  It's not really hurting anything long term, Stans LA football wonderland won't be ready for a few years anyway.   Why not just let them stay another year?   And I'm saying this with all seriousness.  I think with a few good hits in this years draft, the Rams are a legit super bowl contender.  But it doesn't delay the inevitable if the inevitable turns out to be a move back to LA.  It just buys some time I think."
StLouisRams,32didp,Ihateunerds,0,Mon Apr 13 09:33:45 2015 UTC,"I hope we have the chance to find out   Yeah, a SB win would be awesome.  And I see what you're saying about an extra year.  I think it would work if the NFL and Kroenke agreed to not announce the move.  It's an interesting question though.  Would fans still come out to see a championship caliber team in a lame duck season?   I was reading about the Houston Oilers' final season and the article said there were so few fans in the stands that you could hear individual fan conversations from the sidelines.  But the Oilers weren't a SB champ.  Fans would of course be angry at the upcoming move but would the opportunity to attend a game between the SB champions and another top team be enough to overcome that anger?   I hate the Patriots and I hate the Seahawks but if they were playing an interconference game and I was in the area I'd love to go, just to maybe witness a historically good game.  If they can't get the OL straightened out I don't think we'll get the chance to find out anything except see if Foles can take a hit better than Bradford could."
StLouisRams,32h7ro,Magnemmike,4,Mon Apr 13 19:51:36 2015 UTC,Biased title much? I dont see anything in that article mentioning anything about any lawsuits in STL. Its this kind of crap that caused us to need a mega thread...
StLouisRams,32h7ro,Kaos047,2,Mon Apr 13 20:55:34 2015 UTC,"Still need a mega thread. I don't see anything new or productive being posted ever since the rams addiction podcast on the subject.  All i see is repetitive questions, clickbait titles, scared ignorance mixed with fear mongering.  The DRAFT is in like two weeks people, lets focus on that.

StLouisRams,32h7ro,Kaos047,-1,Mon Apr 13 21:29:03 2015 UTC,"The title had nothing to do with the lawsuit.  The title is saying that the committee is meeting and talking about the future.   But yes,  St. Louis is currently tied to a silly lawsuit with issues over voting.   Hence the title,    While St. Louis is squabbling over a lawsuit,  the committee is discussing Los Angeles and the proposals.  Your city has no funding and still has no team signed to help pay for anything, and they are caught up in more nonsense with a lawsuit.  Nothing is getting done over there.    Peacock has drawn up some pretty pictures of a soccer field in the water,  but that's it!"
StLouisRams,32h7ro,Kaos047,2,Tue Apr 14 02:16:44 2015 UTC,You do nothing but try and provoke arguments with the stl crowd. Fuck off.
StLouisRams,328dfl,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,7,Sat Apr 11 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, the more o-line guys we can get the better. We have 2/5 of the starting o-line and 2 or 3 young guys who could potentially make a challenge to claim a starting spot. In no way should we be in a position where the only reason they are starting is because we don't have anybody else to play.   We need o-line badly this draft. I think we should take shots all across the board, I'm talking high picks, as well as lower guys with high upside.  Edit: and in regards to Shaq Mason, he looks like an intelligent guy who is eager to make blocks downfield which is a quality I like, although I could see him struggling at first due to his height at 6'1. Overall he fits a need and I like his tape and what he can bring to the table. But it's unfair to expect him to come in straight away and give production to our line"
StLouisRams,328dfl,TGMurray,4,Sat Apr 11 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"My problem with him is he's a run blocking specialist in a wishbone offense. He looks like a mauler but there are very little examples of his pass protection in this reel. That being said, I wouldn't mind him being on our team."
StLouisRams,328dfl,alderaan_never4get,6,Sat Apr 11 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"Not all bad though, him being a run blocking specialist could fit well into Fisher's run oriented offense."
StLouisRams,328dfl,Wm_TheConqueror,3,Sat Apr 11 18:20:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, and we have talented RBs. If we can land him, I'll be excited about our rushing attack. But maybe I'm having vicarious shell shock from Bradford. I just want decent pass blocking, too."

Our lack of pass protection killed our run situations last year...that and penalties."
StLouisRams,328dfl,FaulktheBlueRedbird,3,Mon Apr 13 04:07:21 2015 UTC,I say take the strategy this draft that we did last year with our secondary.  Grab as many Offensive Lineman and see what sticks to the wall. We got Gaines out of it!
StLouisRams,328dfl,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Sat Apr 11 20:07:45 2015 UTC,"That's probably the best and most realistic strategy.  We can't expect Snead to use 3 picks and get 3 starting offensive linemen, at least not quality starters.  Robinson wasn't ready at the beginning of last year and he was the #2 pick in the entire draft so expecting to snag 3 starters from this draft is wishful thinking at its most wishful.  It's easy to look back at previous drafts and find late round gems with the benefit of hindsight and say, ""let's do what those teams did"" but as good as Snead is nobody is that good.  If we start the year with 3 rookies on the OL I think we're screwed.  This is one of those cases where I hope I'm wrong."
StLouisRams,328dfl,wilamagila,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think rookie linemen that are first/second round talent are that bad. Zack Martin went to the pro bowl his rookie year. Obviously not everyone is him, but as long as we don't draft the talented but not ready yet type of linemen, then they can start right away. Besides anyone we draft in the first four rounds will be at worst 32nd ranked in the nfl, which is what our two interior open spots were last year."
StLouisRams,328dfl,New_DudeToo,2,Sun Apr 12 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"Even in his highlight reel, he looks like one of the last players off the line. That may not make a difference at the collegiate level given his size, but NFL D-lineman will blow by him before he can get out of his stance."

StLouisRams,3257e5,ramslife39,11,Fri Apr 10 17:58:34 2015 UTC,"It seems like he's overvalued himself, or more likely his agent has. Having a poor year last year helped, though some could make the argument that being next to the human turnstyle/doorknob Davin Joseph did him no favors. I don't know how certain GM's and coaches feel about advanced analytics and how surrounding cast affects someone's value. I think him getting married right at the start of free agency did have some sort of role in this. I don't know how, but it just seems like a poor business decision to not be available for the first week of the free agency period.  I hope he gets resigned, on some sort of 3-4 year deal. These 1 year prove it deals don't really move me for someone like him."

StLouisRams,3257e5,To3z,3,Fri Apr 10 18:53:32 2015 UTC,I really don't get why we haven't resigned him yet. We need OT and he's cheaper than he thinks he is. win-win
StLouisRams,3257e5,TheeVande,7,Fri Apr 10 18:17:23 2015 UTC,"he's cheaper than he thinks he is.   Yup, there it is. He's apparently asking over his market value. While the numbers have been getting closer, the Rams are playing it right in waiting and letting him realize his value is lower."
StLouisRams,3257e5,The_Wayward,4,Fri Apr 10 19:50:26 2015 UTC,"I think his agent is trying to leverage the front office for a lot more than he's worth given our OL situation. Which is fine, that's his job.   But I think after visiting a few teams, we'll offer him a little more than them and he'll stick around."
StLouisRams,3257e5,FaulktheBlueRedbird,3,Fri Apr 10 22:55:04 2015 UTC,Awesome news. Barksdale will realize his value now and I hope the Rams make a move
StLouisRams,3257e5,StormSixx17,2,Fri Apr 10 21:44:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like he probably thinks he's worth way more than he actually is, and as soon as he realizes his overestimation, he'll come home for a reasonable price."
StLouisRams,3257e5,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:36:32 2015 UTC,"I really hope that we sign him to a 3 year deal. Let's solidify the rest of the O line, keep 3 starters, but be able to move on if/when Robinson hits his 5th year."

He basically just talked about how his dad got him a Barry Sanders signed jersey as a kid, his thoughts on baseball, basketball, athletic ability in the NFL.  It's always just a random discussion. I hope they keep it going throughout the regular season."
StLouisRams,325ril,jmcatee,7,Fri Apr 10 20:30:07 2015 UTC,"If after free agency and the draft we have a competent OL unit, Nick Foles plays 16 games, and Cignetti is more competent than Schotty... Tavon Austin becomes who he was supposed to be. 800+ receiving yards, 8+ touchdowns. But that is a LOT of variables.   I also think Joyner becomes an asset. Maybe not anything incredible, but he becomes valuable rather than a liability."
StLouisRams,325ril,FaulktheBlueRedbird,3,Fri Apr 10 23:02:00 2015 UTC,"We don't need Tavon to put up those numbers lol. I just hope he gets like 500-600 and maybe some nice hand off runs and 2 punt return tds, I just hope he can kill it on punt returns"
StLouisRams,325ril,RamsWillFly,1 point,Sat Apr 11 06:35:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the only thing we need is a competent OL. Everything else falls into place if the OL is solid. Austin Davis, Sean Hill and Kellen Clemons all would have done much better behind a line that didn't force them to scramble as soon as the ball touched their hands.  Hell Schottenheimer's play schemes might have worked behind a competent OL.  Our run game didn't seem to suffer and will only improve.  Our recieving game last year, DESPITE our shit line, did pretty well.  Our defense got it together once they figured out William's scheme halfway through the season last year and I expect that intensity and cohesion from the second half of the season to carry on this season.  Our lack of offensive prowess has been our weakness for the past 5, but specifically the last 3, years.   We fix that O line and I think everything falls into place this year.   We don't need a superstar QB, just one that isn't on the damn run and getting hit all the time. We are a run first offense and I expect more of it this year with a competent pass game to keep the defense honest."
StLouisRams,325ril,price-iz-right,3,Mon Apr 13 04:03:26 2015 UTC,"I've been following Stedman Bailey this offseason and the guy is putting in work.  Saw him at a Miami nightclub and he was drinking water.  Seems motivated & dedicated.  I think he will be the X-factor with Britt & Quick getting a lot of the attention, along with TA."
StLouisRams,325ril,the_logistician,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:21:02 2015 UTC,"Olineman will never get the credit they deserve.   I would say Mason is a strong candidate based on the idea, the Oline improves. Not shitting on Tavon, but it's going to pretty tough with the secondaries he has to face. If he could be a top 5 returner, and give you 800 yards- 6-8TD's you have a pretty solid slot WR."
StLouisRams,324qgj,LarryCsonkasStache,8,Fri Apr 10 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"I really think Big Blue is going to steal Scherff out from under us at 9. If I were to guess, the best available at 10 will be one of:  La'el Collins: OT from LSU  Shane Ray: DE from Mizzou  Trae Waynes: CB from MSU  From their, I think we either grab Trae as the BPA or trade back into Cam Erving/Andrus Peat/Ereck Flowers territory. Really hoping we re-sign Barksdale which would make Collins kind of a moot point."
StLouisRams,324qgj,The_Wayward,5,Fri Apr 10 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"I don't really think Waynes or Collins is BPA at 10, but you can only pick so many EDGE or DTs. If 3 of Shane Ray, Vic Beasley, Danny Shelton, or Randy Gregory go before us, one of Winston (highly unlikely), Mariota, Schreff, Cooper, or White will fall to us. The problem is there's a shot that only 1 or 2 of those DL/OLB prospects go before in which case one of them will be BPA. I think in that case the  Rams will  probably try to trade back."
StLouisRams,324qgj,banngbanng,3,Fri Apr 10 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"I think two of those three will be gone (Shelton and Beasley) just think Ray is the better player than Gregory so I didn't list him too. Without one of the bigger names we need, I agree it is wise to just trade back. Let someone come up for an edge prospect and settle into the middle of 1 with an extra pick."
StLouisRams,324qgj,The_Wayward,3,Fri Apr 10 17:23:24 2015 UTC,"If we resign Barksdale, the need for Peat becomes moot as well. Personally I would rather have Peat. Barksdale is good don't get me wrong, but I feel like Peat is much better."
StLouisRams,324qgj,TacoxOFxBell,2,Fri Apr 10 20:45:46 2015 UTC,"He may be better, but I'd rather our line have 4 solidified starters going into day two of the draft than only 3. Trying to fill 3 starting Oline spots in the draft is a really bad idea."
StLouisRams,324qgj,The_Wayward,2,Fri Apr 10 21:25:00 2015 UTC,"I do agree with that, but I feel that there is only 2 spots to fill on the OL through the draft. Jones can play either G or C depending on how they go in the draft. He does come with a few question marks, but I feel like he is ready to play."
StLouisRams,324qgj,TacoxOFxBell,2,Fri Apr 10 21:30:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like Jones should be ready by now, but I've yet to see anything to prove that point on the field or even in an article. I'm not convinced we can pencil him in for anything but depth at the moment. Obviously its possible we find out he can play this season, but I'm not ready to commit to him like that."
StLouisRams,324qgj,The_Wayward,2,Fri Apr 10 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"I love the obnoxious DL we have, but I think Shane Ray would be fucking overkill.   Trae Waynes would be an insanely awesome pick in my opinion. We already added Akeem Ayers, upgrading at LB. Icing the secondary with a Waynes/Gaines combination would just be incredible. Imagine our DL hunting the quarterback while that secondary falls back and chokes out the receivers. We'd be maybe a Saftey and LB away from a top 5 defense."

StLouisRams,324qgj,superspamtastic,3,Fri Apr 10 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"If Mariota, White, Cooper and Scherff are gone then I say we trade back. I could see us possibly grabbing Waynes or one of the top edge rushers but that would be a tough pill to swallow.   With our top targets gone my preference would be to trade back and load up on OL."
StLouisRams,324qgj,Chillinthamost,2,Fri Apr 10 18:42:13 2015 UTC,I thought about this for a while now and for me if Scherff or Cooper is off the board at 10 you have to go Trae Waynes because if groomed correctly he can give the Rams something they never had before which is a lockdown CB and we wouldn't have to feel the need to throw money at Jenkins when his contract is up. I would love Scheff or Cooper but I would be just as happy with  Waynes  along with Johnson and Gaines in the backfield.

StLouisRams,32187e,CrackMamba,6,Thu Apr 9 19:32:15 2015 UTC,"If we draft him at 10 I'll eat my own anus. We're too invested in raw receivers already from the 13 draft, if we take a WR there he'd have to be ready to play. Cooper or White. Honestly I don't see Snead  pulling the trigger on either of them even if they're available.  We need linemen. Personally I think we should try to trade down and get extra picks to spend on guards and centers."
StLouisRams,32187e,porkfish66,12,Thu Apr 9 23:18:30 2015 UTC,"He's fast. He's incredibly raw. Too raw to be a top 10 pick or even before Parker if you ask me. I still don't understand our fanbase's obsession with going WR early. Last year with Watkins, this year with Cooper/White. We have invested HEAVILY in WR in previous drafts as well as bringing Britt back, and I don't see the necessity unless the value disparity is that large before the next tier of players. If a White or Cooper were still there at 10, I hope we use that to leverage a trade back into OLine territory. If Scherff is around at 10, I feel that pick is a no brainer."
StLouisRams,32187e,The_Wayward,3,Thu Apr 9 19:43:56 2015 UTC,"I don't see how people couldn't see WR1 as probably our second biggest need.  We. Don't. Have. One. Plain and simple. We haven't had one since Holt.  You need one to be good in this league.  We don't need anymore number 2 receivers, we have nice depth at the position. But there is not a receiver on this roster that will ever log a 1000 yard season in his career outside of maybe Quick and he's a big gamble coming off that injury.    That said, I'd only want Cooper or White in this draft. If they aren't there at ten draft Scherff or trade down. We can't take a Brian Quick project again."
StLouisRams,32187e,Ihateunerds,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:08:37 2015 UTC,"Not true at all you need one to contend, Pats, Seahawks were just int he superbowl without them. and look at the Lions or the Falcons."
StLouisRams,32187e,ramsdude456,2,Fri Apr 10 18:11:38 2015 UTC,So our WR corps are good enough to compete for a super bowl? If not then it is a  need.
StLouisRams,32187e,avanhokie,2,Sat Apr 11 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"The reason why is we still don't have a true #1 WR one that will draw double coverage and help the others on the field. As much as I want a new sexy WR like cooper on our roster, we need to get Scheriff I'm a big believer that if we can grab him at ten that we should possibly trade into the late first to grab DGB"
StLouisRams,32187e,DabDastic,9,Thu Apr 9 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"I understand that we don't have a Calvin Johnson/Dez Bryant on our team. I just don't think that a marquee #1 receiver is that relevant to how the Rams play, or how you go about winning a Super Bowl. I'm not saying that an all star WR wouldn't change things, but since the Pack won in 2011, DT is the only true stud WR to even play in the Super Bowl. On the other side of the coin, all of those teams have had good play from their line. The only exception being the Seahawks because Russell Wilson is a slippery phantom robot who covers up a lot of his line's deficiencies"
StLouisRams,32187e,The_Wayward,4,Thu Apr 9 21:07:58 2015 UTC,Seahawks and Patriots don't have true #1 receivers and both were in the Super Bowl last year. You don't need a #1 receiver to be a contender. The Lions have one of the best WRs of all time and still had the worst ten year record recently. The Texans had Andre Johnson and were terrible. We have other holes in the roster that need fixing a hell of a lot more than WR. And it's been proven that you don't need a #1 guy to succeed.
StLouisRams,32187e,bwc_28,2,Thu Apr 9 21:09:18 2015 UTC,"3 of those teams were in the playoffs, so sure, I'll take that, especially combined with how good our defence is."
StLouisRams,32187e,ramsrgood,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:34:33 2015 UTC,Scheriff would be a no brainer. But if it's between a WR and a DE as the BPA's I'll take the WR
StLouisRams,32187e,Davidfreeze,4,Sat Apr 11 11:35:32 2015 UTC,"Perriman at 10 is an incredible waste of a pick. He runs fast, great that's great. Can't run a route and has very suspect hands."
StLouisRams,32187e,bozo7337,2,Sat Apr 11 05:32:21 2015 UTC,Exactly. We already have a really fast receiver that can't run a route cough tavon cough Although hopefully this year he will improve.
StLouisRams,32187e,Wm_TheConqueror,2,Thu Apr 9 22:43:43 2015 UTC,Taking Perriman at 10
StLouisRams,32187e,ImTheBestMayne,2,Sat Apr 11 17:59:02 2015 UTC,I think most outsiders think Rams are weaker at WR than they truly are. Our WR core  is fine with a better QB. Only way I see them take WR in the first if they think it is BPA.
StLouisRams,32187e,mlasn,2,Fri Apr 10 14:30:27 2015 UTC,I'm of the opinion that if Cooper or Scherff aren't available then we should either trade down (depending on value) or take Trae Waynes.  CB is definitely a big need for us.
StLouisRams,32187e,washeduplegend,2,Thu Apr 9 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think CB is a big need for us. At best it's like our fourth need. OT, OG, C, with QB probably being the next one seeing as the ones on our roster are only signed for a year WR, and CB kinda being the next in line although MLB depth would be real nice."
StLouisRams,32187e,axle69,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:17:18 2015 UTC,"Oh man I'd be stoked if we picked up Waynes. As much as I want Danny Shelton or Shaq Thompson (as a UW fan) they aren't positions of need, Waynes would be a hell of a pickup at 10."
StLouisRams,32187e,bwc_28,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:14:25 2015 UTC,"If Scherff and Cooper are both gone by 10, would Devante Parker be BPA? I am not convinced we'll  draft Perriman and I think we need to  go with either a top tier receiver or Trae Wayans if Scherff isn't on the board."
StLouisRams,31su6r,IAmA_scientist2,12,Tue Apr 7 22:06:23 2015 UTC,"I fully believe that he was the key to the greatest show on turf.  Some could argue Kurt Warner or maybe Bruce/Holt combo, but Faulk set everything up.  Opposing d's always had to account for him in both the running and passing games.  He could literally do it all; run the ball between the tackles, run the ball outside the tackles, catch a ball out of the backfield and turn it up for 20/td, pick up the block on play action.  He completely redefined the RB position and the position hasn't been the same since.  Damn I miss him."
StLouisRams,31su6r,washeduplegend,2,Wed Apr 8 02:37:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, it showed when the team declined when he did. I think I never really got behind SJax because I kept comparing him to Faulk"
StLouisRams,31su6r,NewBroPewPew,0,Wed Apr 8 03:09:31 2015 UTC,You also forgot he set the standard for blocking RB's in the NFC west. He would routinely standup blitzing LB's in the hole.
StLouisRams,31su6r,birdmandersen,8,Wed Apr 8 14:06:17 2015 UTC,I'd forgotten that his 28 TD's were in only 14 games. Could potentially be tied with LT for the record right now if he'd played the full season
StLouisRams,31su6r,TacoxOFxBell,5,Wed Apr 8 00:10:02 2015 UTC,Yup! Not to mention he almost became the first RB with three straight seasons of 20+ TDs before he got injured in 2004
StLouisRams,31su6r,butter_my_fingers,4,Wed Apr 8 00:37:44 2015 UTC,It is truly off putting that he has been out of football for 10 years. He is truly one of the greats.
StLouisRams,31su6r,ronniemexico,2,Wed Apr 8 13:34:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of people say LeSean McCoy is one of the top 3 RBs in the league, and hes nowhere near the RB Faulk was"
StLouisRams,31su6r,TurtlesAndTrees,5,Wed Apr 8 14:29:17 2015 UTC,I'd say out of all the RBs in the league Forte is probably the closest (catching/rushing/blocking)
StLouisRams,31su6r,FaulktheBlueRedbird,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:21:27 2015 UTC,Great comparison actually!
StLouisRams,31su6r,FaulktheBlueRedbird,4,Wed Apr 8 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"the reason I became a Rams fan. I saw him destroy UTEP before my birthday as a kid, and was hooked.  If it wasn't for Martz and getting addicted to the pass, Faulk would have had a very different ending to his career. Easily the most versatile player I ever saw play, and could turn the defense around on the field like Barry Sanders and as mentioned already, could keep linebackers on the ground with his blitz protections. He was a g."
StLouisRams,31su6r,wilamagila,3,Wed Apr 8 15:01:35 2015 UTC,I just watched a Marshall Faulk highlight video- I'd forgotten how much he looked like Barry Sanders when he ran. They both do the same sort of jump-cuts.

StLouisRams,31srf1,xKeyNin,10,Tue Apr 7 23:13:22 2015 UTC,There's a city law that says it has to go to a vote.
StLouisRams,31srf1,Seductive_Santa,-5,Tue Apr 7 23:19:40 2015 UTC,Good. I'd much rather see the team move than burden the city with more debt when they're still paying off the Ed.

StLouisRams,31s4cs,SoulardSTL,6,Tue Apr 7 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"Not advocating for either side here but was just wondering how much this matters:  Stan is one of the richest owners in sports, and he has legal precedence to move the Rams even if the NFL doesn't support him. This vote doesn't mean much.   Am I right or wrong here? Someone let me know."
StLouisRams,31s4cs,Perspective1310,5,Wed Apr 8 03:46:37 2015 UTC,"They can't force him to stay, per say. But, there are monetary penalties that can be used to dissuade him if he moves without a vote."
StLouisRams,31s4cs,CJW1215,4,Wed Apr 8 04:33:06 2015 UTC,"As loath as I am to admit it, it seems that he's already prepared to take a multi-billion dollar hit, in some way, shape, or form, to make the move a reality. Can the NFL really fine him enough to make the increase in market value lose its luster while avoiding looking like a bully? It'd have to be a hefty or incredibly long lived punitive measure."
StLouisRams,31s4cs,RiverfrontRampage,4,Wed Apr 8 23:37:35 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard over time... Say STL has a sound proposal, with financing; the NFL Owners vote that STL retains the team; and Stan Kroenke pulls a ""Baltimore Colts"" on us in contravention to a League vote (all this regardless of whether or not the Chargers and/or Raiders follow through with Carson). Should this happen, the League likely would institute punitive fines of around $800MM-1BB+; regular relocation fees of up to $500MM; and denial of future opportunities, such as hosting Super Bowls or denying shared TV revenues. They'd likely stick it to him on cross-ownership rules as well. All of this would be in addition to the $1.7BB development cost, tens of millions to physically move the pro team itself (think infrastructure), and probably $100MM/year the team plays in the Rose Bowl or LA Coliseum while Inglewood gets built. So yes, it's possible the NFL could make relocation financially undesirable, up to and potentially exceeding the increased paper valuation of a relocated team. Kroenke has stated that he'd go along with whatever vote the League decides upon, but as we know, his word can be as malleable as bubble gum. The real nuclear option would be for the NFL to de-schedule the team from the next season's games until they have compliance or a settlement, an option I think super unlikely but theoretically possible."
StLouisRams,31s4cs,CJW1215,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:24:44 2015 UTC,"They can take away his share of league revenues, and fine him like 250-500k a day."
StLouisRams,31s4cs,Seductive_Santa,3,Thu Apr 9 02:30:06 2015 UTC,I think this was expected. They weren't gonna move on this in May.
StLouisRams,31s4cs,bozo7337,2,Tue Apr 7 23:22:17 2015 UTC,Yup there are talks that they could keep moving forward with the plan but no vote to move is expected from what I read until the fall meeting.
StLouisRams,31s4cs,thatoneguy889,2,Wed Apr 8 01:47:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. Glad this gives everyone a time table so proposals can come together and expectations can be measured.
StLouisRams,31s4cs,DeniseDeNephew,3,Thu Apr 9 00:08:40 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect any major stuff to happen before the beginning of the next season, but why does the league continue to grandstand and act like the decision is up to them?"
StLouisRams,31s4cs,thatoneguy889,2,Thu Apr 9 14:21:40 2015 UTC,"This announcement is the best thing for all parties involved.   Stan Kroenke doesn't have to announce his intentions until the season is nearly over so if he says he is moving the team in 2016 it will have little impact on season ticket sales for 2015.  Stan does not want to make any decisions made public now so this announcement serves him. The NFL gets to look like they are in charge even if they are not, and helping Stan line his pockets helps every Owner do the same.  This also keeps pressure on San Diego and Oakland to build new stadiums.  If Obama's 2016 budget or even just the line item disallowing tax-free bonds to be used to build stadiums passes then the landscape completely changes so the NFL needs to squeeze as much from cities as they can this year because it may be their last chance.   Dave Peacock gets extra time to try to find private funding, and he is a paid consultant.  Win or lose he's going to get paid, and the longer this issue stretches out the more he makes.  Peacock benefit$ from this announcement.     It looks like grandstanding on the surface but I think this is a very calculated move that was made with the approval of all Owners including Kroenke."
StLouisRams,31s4cs,thatoneguy889,1 point,Fri Apr 10 11:10:28 2015 UTC,"NFL consultant Marc Ganis, President of SportsCorp and key figure to the 1995 relocations of the Rams & Raiders, recently noted the following:   ""... what Stan owns is a membership in an association. He does not own a private business. There's a major distinction. Just like you can't move a McDonald's franchise from the St. Louis suburbs to downtown Chicago because you don't own the territory, you can't move an NFL team without the association's approval. You only need 25 percent (of the owners to say no to prevent relocation) and I'm confident that number is well north of 25 percent. Stan has to go through the process like everyone else.""  Ganis thinks that, if Dave Peacock, et.al. can provide a tangible stadium proposal, according to the letter of the League's rules, and with financing secured, then it is a greater than 50% chance that the League will keep the Rams in STL."

StLouisRams,31rlmt,Chillinthamost,5,Tue Apr 7 17:15:15 2015 UTC,I'm worried about this. We have to retain Barksdale. We can't walk into the draft with three question marks on the O line. Lets hope they aren't in serious negotiations.

StLouisRams,31rlmt,The49ersBlow,2,Tue Apr 7 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"At this point, I'm really hoping he's using the Titans for leverage against the Rams. Show that another team is interested to possibly get a more lucrative deal. We need to keep him in-house."

The guy just got married so I'm sure he's going to look at the offer that will give him the most security/stability.

StLouisRams,31p6l7,cover32Engel,18,Tue Apr 7 01:41:50 2015 UTC,"Great post. It really sheds some light on the perspective of St. Louis based Rams fans.   “In many ways, St. Louis hasn’t failed the NFL — the NFL has failed St. Louis.”"
StLouisRams,31p6l7,Popolar,15,Tue Apr 7 01:52:31 2015 UTC,"If you follow baseball, then you see similarities between St. Louis with football and Montreal with baseball. I mention Montreal because the last two years the Blue Jays have hosted a couple of spring training games, and they have sold out each time. What is amazing is many fans in the Montreal area want the Expos back, but then how did the team fail originally? Well they had bad luck with their best year, 1994, ending in a strike. Then they only had one playoff appearance in 1981. Mixed in many bad years and cheap owners who shipped off their talent like Pedro Martinez because they wouldn't spend the money, then the owners and MLB blame the city and fans for not wanting to watch a cellar team.  Now we look at St. Louis, and besides 4 great years with the GSOT, then it has been abysmal football. First the football Cardinals were losers with a handful of playoff appearances, and add in an idiot owner whose buddy GM baffled millions of Americans with his draft picks. Then we look at the Rams who somehow took the GSOT to historically bad levels of football.   What do the Rams, Cardinals, Expos, NFL, and MLB have in common? They blame the fans for their incompetence of putting garbage on the field. The Rams sold out constantly when they were good. Even good franchises see dips in attendance when the team struggles. I saw a couple of Bears games, since I live in Chicago, in which fans didn't show up towards the end because people were disinterested. No one questions the Bears fan loyalty, but common sense dictates some fans won't show up when they suck.   I guess my point is that the city of STL has shown plenty of loyal fans who spent good money to watch garbage. More-so then any other city, besides Oakland, of watching a team who hasn't had a winning season in a decade which no other city has dealt with, minus Oakland of course. The fact the area is trying to build a new stadium after 20 years shows they want to keep football in the area, and it's insane they have to do it considering the stadium is 20 years old.   No offense to the LA fans, but you are burying your head into the sand about Stan Kronke. He is a sleeze-ball who seems to encourage mediocrity as long as his bottom line is good. There is a reason why my friends in Denver despise the man who owns the Avalanche and Nuggets. Besides Arsenal, who is basically trying to buy a championship and hasn't won the UEFA Champions League yet, then he hasn't had much success with any sports franchise he touches. Overall his Rams record has been horrendous. Spags was a disaster, and Fischer has been mediocre. I personally like Fischer, but what has he shown us? A bunch of 6-7 win seasons. Granted, the NFC West is tough now, but the NFL is tough in general. They either play well in the NFC west, or play well outside of conference, but not both. How in the hell can the same team beat Denver and Seattle, but not the Giants? Simply put that is inconsistent.   Anyway, go ahead and downvote me for calling out Stan to be a sleeze-ball and a mediocre owner at best who only cares about his bottom line then putting a winning and sustainable product on the field like the Seahawks, Patriots, or baseball teams like the Giants or Cardinals."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,panderson1988,7,Tue Apr 7 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you would say LA fans are burying their heads in the sand. You do realize that if the Rams stay in STL, Kroenke will still own the team, right? He owns them no matter where they play their home games."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,The49ersBlow,8,Tue Apr 7 09:01:23 2015 UTC,"LA fans think he is great, but only because he might move the team. They ignore his poor record because he will move the team. Same with STL fans with Frontier, but she did build a good team for a few years."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,panderson1988,10,Tue Apr 7 11:51:14 2015 UTC,"As a Rams fan regardless of location, Kroenke is far from our biggest problem. At least he hires people to run the team and doesn't meddle in the affairs like he knows how to scout."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,The49ersBlow,2,Tue Apr 7 12:07:00 2015 UTC,"I can agree to an extent because we don't want Jerry Jones, but so far his staff selections have been mediocre to poor. Spags was a disaster, and Fischer has stagnated between 6-7 wins. The 49s and Seahawks have turned things around in the last 5 years. So has Denver, and several other teams. The Rams had one year, in 2010, in which we had a playoff shot in the final week. That has been it since 2004. And it has been Kronke show for 5 years now, and you have to hold him to an extent accountable because this is his staff. Maybe Fischer and Snead isn't working out. We have stagnated and regressed, and I'm tired of inconsistent play. Then again, maybe Foles is the answer? It is hard to get my hopes up when the best we can do is 7 wins."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,panderson1988,2,Tue Apr 7 12:26:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wasn't impressed with the Fisher hire originally, and I'm still not. He's a proven mediocre coach who has shown he cannot adapt his philosophy. That being said, I was very impressed with Kroenke for being willing to pay a coach $7mil/year. You don't spend that kind of money if you just want to be a subpar team and continue to cash the shared revenue checks.  As far as Spags goes, that was on Georgia. And her children gave him an extra year. I could be wrong, but I think I remember reading somewhere that Georgia stated on her death bed that she wanted Spags to have another chance. Again, I could be wrong."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,The49ersBlow,5,Tue Apr 7 12:37:23 2015 UTC,"Spags was hired in 2009, and Georgia died in 2008. Also Spags was coming off a Super Bowl win with the Giants around that time if I recalled. Now i won't say if Kronke had much input on the hire since it was in the transition process since Georgia died in 2008.   That said, I wont say that Kronke doesn't care at all, but I don't think he has that sense of identifying the right people in sports. Some people like Kraft do, but then Spanos doesn't.   That said, my issue is how distant Stan is with all of his teams. I feel like he phones it in with the Avalanche and Nuggets most of time. It's why they haven't had much success, and the fans are disinterested. Active owners who at least pop up for the fans seem to do better. I live in Chicago, and the Bears owner was on TV and talked about how last season was unacceptable. Meanwhile Stan is nowhere to be found after any season. I guess that's my issue is I feel like he only cares when he absolutely has to, as in getting a new coach. Otherwise he randomly pops up."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,panderson1988,5,Tue Apr 7 12:45:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right about Spags. I was thinking that other worthless first time coach that was a hailed coordinator, albeit not one coming off a dominating Super Bowl victory.   As far as Kroenke's distance and disinterest, I agree. He has not done anything as owner of the Rams that makes me like him. He's a nobody really, with a ton of money. If the team moves to LA, he will be hit with a media I don't know he has ever experienced. And if he doesn't put a quality product on the field, no one will care there either.   My real fear is that he doesn't care about results because moving from STL back to LA will make the team more valuable than if he won the next 5 Super Bowls in STL. And if he really is only concerned about his bottom line, he can build this stadium in Inglewood, hang on to the team for a few years, and sell it for 3-4 billion. God forbid they keep it in the family and Josh inherits it."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,The49ersBlow,4,Tue Apr 7 12:53:59 2015 UTC,"You share my sentiments exactly. Also the worthless coordinator was Scott Linehan. I still laughed how Detroit thought he was a good hire as the offensive coordinator a few years ago.   Also you mention how Stan is just a guy with a lot of money, and I almost get a sense he just wants to own teams since it's prestigious. Granted, some owners are like that, but then some owners at least get somewhat involved and try to build a good program like Kraft to Bowlen's family in Denver. Bowlen has been the owner since the mid 80s of the Broncos, and it always seem his goal was to create a winner. Logically some years it didn't work out, but he has gotten two Super Bowls in the late 90s, and several other Super Bowl and playoff appearances with it. To me that is a good owner because realistically you won't win every year, but he gets involved when changes with management is needed, but he won't dictate his GM on draft picks or who should start like Jerry Jones has done.   Then you are correct about the media because when he bought Arsenal and stumbled out, then the London media has been harsh on him. Now Arsenal is somewhat in a better spot again, but it looks like he won't win any championships this year. At least his team right now is in a UEFA Champions League group play spot.   Finally I'm glad you mention Josh because he has done a decent job with the Colorado Rapids. He won it all in 2010 which is something, and he has qualified for the playoffs a couple of times since then. Also Stan was suppose to relinquish his ownership with the Avalanche and Nuggets to his son due to the NFL rules, yet he keeps breaking them despite the timeline he was given. That is shady to me, and makes me worry about the NFL being hypocrites at upholding their rules, then again we already see that constantly with Roger Goodell."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,panderson1988,2,Tue Apr 7 13:20:07 2015 UTC,"Here is how I see Stan and the NFL enforcing their rules. First, Stan doesn't seem to care about any rules the NFL has. He's gonna do what he wants, everyone be damned. And the NFL might talk a big talk, but the owners know that they risk a ton if they have to go to court and settle things. That could jeopardize their antitrust standing and their 503(c) tax exempt status, if we leave it up to the courts to decide. So I think that owners will begrudgingly vote to allow Stan to continue side skirting the cross ownership rules, and probably the franchise relocation too. That way they can still present the appearance that they were the ones who ""allowed"" Kroenke to own Denver sports franchises. And, if it happens, they are the ones who will ""allow"" him to move to LA. But I wouldn't be surprised if they make him pay for it. I've heard $500 mil floated around as a potential relocation fee. I could see it going to $750 mil honestly. Especially if he continues to disregard the other owners."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,The49ersBlow,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:38:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of your thoughts, although I would say Stan isn't in it for the prestige or building a winner - he owns sports teams because they are a license to print money. All he cares about is money. Sure, moving to L.A. would make him a local hero, and there would be a quite a bit of prestige with it. But there's no way he would even consider moving if there wasn't a whole shitload of money to be made by doing so (which there clearly would be)."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,porkfish66,5,Tue Apr 7 18:58:41 2015 UTC,That rancid old cunt had nothing to do with building a team. She finally backed off and let her staff do its job.
StLouisRams,31p6l7,bozo7337,6,Tue Apr 7 19:05:37 2015 UTC,People who actually followed the team then know that John Shaw and Dick Vermiel built the team. They know that they caught lightning in a bottle with Warner. Those who don't know what they're talking about say the stripper built that club.
StLouisRams,31p6l7,Seductive_Santa,4,Wed Apr 8 00:34:11 2015 UTC,"While I agree that he's obviously not the best owner, as an LA fan who has gone without football of any kind for 20 years, I can't help but applaud someone who has the initiative to build the stadium on his own. Downvote me if you want, but after having the rug pulled out so many times by the league it's refreshing that someone is finally serious about it.  The reality is that we should have gotten an expansion team (or just kept the fucking Rams and you got your Stallions) years ago and the topic of STL proving themselves shouldn't even be a debate, because the league has proven profitable there. Kronke's LA plan is too impressive for the league to pass up, and it will ultimately be a money move if and when the Rams move."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,panderson1988,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:59:58 2015 UTC,"I won't because your view point is fair and I agree how STL should have gotten an expansion team over Jacksonville. I only downvote people who bash a whole city and it's fans because it's ignorant, but I had my moment today which made me no better.   That said, I personally want the Rams to stay since I've been a fan for most of their tenure in STL, and I grew up with them. I see moves as a betrayal, and that is my view on it. I wish LA had a team, for one to end the ""Ima gonna move to LA if you don't move the heaven and earth card"" with every team who needs a stadium, then the area deserves a team. How Jacksonville has a team in a crowded area between the Falcons, Dolphins, and Bucs is baffling."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,FaulktheBlueRedbird,-2,Tue Apr 7 17:45:27 2015 UTC,"This might be a poor, comparison but I always like to point out that the Dodgers sold more seats than any other baseball franchise in the MLB last year, filling only 84 percent of their seats. The Rams sold at 86 percent of their seats last year and were second to last in the NFL.  Now obviously supply and demand is a huge factor here with over 10 times as many baseball games being held than football games. But the fact that the LA market the second largest in North America and the Dodgers are a World Series contending team should also be mentioned.   My point is that 86% is really not bad at all considering St. Louis has had over a decade of arguably the worst football teams in NFL history. I highly doubt that LA would sell at a higher percentage then St Louis has this past decade, despite its enormous market."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,bwc_28,-1,Tue Apr 7 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"You can't compare baseball attendance to football attendance... LA supported the Rams when they were in LA, that's all that matters."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,FaulktheBlueRedbird,2,Wed Apr 8 08:42:53 2015 UTC,"I admitted it was a bad comparison.   Just saying that football attendance, in general, tends to be overly criticized. If the worst football attendance its in the mid-upper 80's, then that's pretty damn good."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,bwc_28,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:32:55 2015 UTC,"If the worst football attendance its in the mid-upper 80's, then that's pretty damn good.   Based on what metric? Compared to everyone else in the league it's obviously not very good. Also you're only looking at attendance percentage, which isn't taking into account different stadium sizes. The Redskins for example have comparable attendance percentages as the Rams, 84.2% for them and 87.2% for us. The difference is they still put over 20,000 more people in their seats per game, over 150,000 more people per season. That's significant. The Dolphins also manage to put nearly 10,000 more people in their seats per game than us, while having lower attendance percentages. Compared to every relevant metric St Louis attendance over at least the last five years has been terrible."

StLouisRams,31p6l7,bwc_28,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:05:05 2015 UTC,This is never a simple debate.   Exactly my point. But there are more indications that support for the Rams in St Louis is not good than evidence that it's decent.
StLouisRams,31p6l7,FaulktheBlueRedbird,2,Wed Apr 8 20:37:54 2015 UTC,"This just isn't true. It's not based on facts.   There are seven teams with attendance rates in the 80%. Shocker: 6/7 of them have sucked for a long fucking time. None of these teams has been as terrible as the Rams, and the Rams beat three of those teams for attendance last year.   The Rams are almost equal with the Pittsburgh Steelers for attendance, packing in 87.3% in 2013 vs. the Steelers 88.3%. Both have similarly sized stadiums/markets. The Steelers are one of the most popular and storied franchises in the country, and moving them would be awful. Rams fans have shown pretty much equal support as Steeler's fans. The Bills attendance has also hovered between high 80's low 90's, despite their incredibly loyal fan-base.   It just comes down to this: the Rams were the worst team in the NFL collectively for a decade. So the attendance is going to be towards the bottom of the league. But the Rams are also only a few percent lower in attendance than some other franchises that no one even considers for relocation. There isn't some incredible gap in loyalty or attendance that you're suggesting."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,bwc_28,2,Wed Apr 8 21:41:29 2015 UTC,"I just pointed out why you can't simply look at attendance percentages and here you are using that as your only argument. Also continue downvoting those you disagree with, not only are people like you ruining this subreddit when you do petty shit like that but you're breaking reddiquette.   It just comes down to this: the Rams were the worst team in the NFL collectively for a decade.   Actually that's not true, Detroit was the worst. over a decade We had the worst five year stretch though."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,FaulktheBlueRedbird,2,Wed Apr 8 22:12:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote you man. Don't throw those accusations around.   And the Lions had the worst record for a decade, but also had winning seasons within that decade and a playoff berth. Not sure which I'd consider worse."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,bozo7337,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:54:50 2015 UTC,"League average for 2014 was 68,331(which was driven way down by the fact the Vikings played temporarily in a small college stadium and averaged 12k less than in 2013). The Rams averaged 57,018. The Rams were at 83.44% of the NFL's average. Drawing 83% of what other NFL teams is pretty good? Fourteen of the NFL's teams were below average and there were only 2 teams worse than the Rams, the Raiders and the aforementioned Vikings in their small stadium. I guess being at 83% of the NFL average for attendance is something to brag about."

StLouisRams,31p6l7,panderson1988,-12,Thu Apr 9 00:09:33 2015 UTC,"It's so typically blind for people to blame Kroenke for the last 10 years. He's been owner for four. Get the fuck over it and quit blaming him for 10 years. Also you act like he isn't spending money to build up a team. He's not signing our good players. He's not signing good coaches and good front office people. Are the Avalanche bad? Yes they're a bottom 10 team in the NHL this year but here's an idea! How about you blame the person in charge of putting the product on the ice THE FUCKING GM!! Now if he leaves a bad GM in place for more than 3 or 4 years(more than enough time in the NHL to turn around a bad franchise) without any improvement then you have a case against Kroenke(or any owner for that matter).  Are the Nuggets bad in the NBA? Yes they're a bottom 10 team in the NBA! Oh stop wait I know Kroenke is their owner and GM? He's another Jerry Jones isn't he? Oh what's that he's not the GM? Hmmmmmm maybe we should take a look at who the GM is or the Team President?  I see a trend here if there's an owner in St Louis that you don't like then it's his or her fault and you're not going to go to the games. What that the team has been improving the last 3 years and is actually competitive? Not enough for the mighty St Louis fans! You're delusional if you think every owner of every sport doesn't care about the bottom line of their teams. Also your Pedro Martinez is incredibly flawed because the Dodgers traded him before the Expos did. A team who spends money traded him before the Expos did.   But go ahead and down vote me because I'm saying it's not Kroenke's fault that people in St Louis don't go to games. Afterall teams like the Browns who never win sell more tickets than the Rams. Teams that have never won the Super Bowl like the Cardinals, Jaguars, Bills, Titans and 9 others sell more tickets than the Rams. Hell the Rams won a Super Bowl more recently than the Niners. The damned Bengals haven't won a playoff game since the Rams were in LA, but please tell me how bad you have it living in St Louis."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,axle69,9,Tue Apr 7 04:54:57 2015 UTC,"FYI, I'm sorry for the insults. That was uncalled for, but your statements about STL fans is ignorant, just like me in the past saying all LA fans are bandwogners when that isn't the case. Especially with the Kings and Dodgers fans since they have many dedicated fans."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,The49ersBlow,2,Tue Apr 7 13:21:39 2015 UTC,Kroenke was partial owner before the team was sold to him. He's had a say in all things basically since the move. Not saying anything pre his full ownership is fully his fault but it is partially up to him and his 4 year tenure has been absolutely abhorrent from an owners standpoint.
StLouisRams,31p6l7,axle69,6,Tue Apr 7 06:14:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you aren't majority owner, you're a silent partner who collects income. You think all the other co-owners of the Raiders during the last decade and a half supported the crazy moves Al Davis made? I can't see that being the case."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,The49ersBlow,1 point,Tue Apr 7 09:03:46 2015 UTC,As a heads up Kroenke owned something like 40% of the team at the time of the move. He had a say no matter the label of silent partner or not and was obviously first in line to buy out the remaining once Georgia died.
StLouisRams,31p6l7,axle69,2,Tue Apr 7 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, his purchase agreement at the time he purchased his minority share of the team afforded him the right of first refusal to purchase the remaining 60% of the team should it become available for whatever reason. However, that did not entitle him any voice in to how the team was ran on a daily basis. Plus, he had to sense that Georgia wasn't 100% healthy and getting much older, so why would he want to provide any counsel to the team? Essentially, he purchased the remaining 60% at a bargain because the team had no value. According to Forbes, (http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/30/football-valuations-10_NFL-Team-Valuations_Rank.html) in 2010, the Rams were worth $779 million, and dropped 15% in value from the previous year, ranking 29th of 32. He bought a billion dollar business when it was trending down.   Basically, I personally see Kroenke as a billion dollar businessman with little passion for sports, aside from having them in his portfolio."
StLouisRams,31p6l7,The49ersBlow,4,Tue Apr 7 16:00:47 2015 UTC,I agree with your assessment but it makes for poor owners in regards too competition. Wanting to make your billions and field a competitive team like say Khan is what matters. Yes I'm aware the Jaguars have had just as bad of a team over the years but he breaks the bank in advertising and stadium additions while doing to Europe trip every year to get that bonus exposure. When the team turns around their record they'll be set.
StLouisRams,31p6l7,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. The system doesn't favor the fans though. As an NFL owner, you can make lots of money every year by having an awful team. I would prefer an owner like Shahid Khan. Or Arthur Blank. I know Bobby Kraft is the role model, but I don't know that he could have foretold the dynasty he would create.   Here's one. Why can't Kroenke be like Paul Allen of the professional Pacific Northwest? He rarely speaks to the media, but also doesn't avoid it like the plague. He spends money, hires coaches, and that team is above average because of it."

But that doesn't change the fact that they're not showing up or vocally supporting the team! If even the articles like this which are trying to paint St Louis football fans in a positive light state that they've not stuck with the team what does that say?"
StLouisRams,31p6l7,bwc_28,11,Wed Apr 8 08:41:21 2015 UTC,"It says that a lot of people - especially outside of St. Louis (save for Thom Brennaman) - are neglecting to mention any sort of context when it comes to the Rams' ""subpar"" fan support over the past decade. For a city that's had to watch a football team that's won 1/3 of its games over the past 10 years while facing constant relocation rumors, St. Louis has supported the Rams a hell of a lot better than a whole hell of a lot of other cities would in similar circumstances (including L.A.)"
StLouisRams,31p6l7,bozo7337,3,Tue Apr 7 02:07:53 2015 UTC,St. Louis has supported the Rams a hell of a lot better than a whole hell of a lot of other cities would in similar circumstances (including L.A.)   You're going to have cite your sources on that statement. LA attendance barely saw a drop at any point. Anaheim was the city that showed a drop in attendance similar to what you're seeing in St Louis. All evidence points to LA being extremely loyal to the Rams.

Have not had a dominant WR in almost a decade.  No WR on the team has even cracked the 800 yard mark in a season.  Its a need.  I like White's or Cooper's value at 10 more than selecting a OG in Scherff or a tackle in Collins.  I think trading down you can still have a Peat, Clemmings, Flowers at RT and a Cann, Erving, Jackson in day 2."
StLouisRams,31j99s,ITameFatGirls,3,Sun Apr 5 17:33:00 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying. But I will never judge this receiving corps until it plays 16 games under one, decently protected quarterback.   Without the O-Line, bad things happen. Look at Foles in 2013 with an elite unit compared to last year. Night and day. So if we go for Cooper or White at 10, we probably can't pass to our new premier receiver even if we wanted to. And of course our running game suffers without the O line as well, which has really been our only consistent weapon these past years. Now we're sitting ducks on offense no matter what.  Secondly, the commonly held belief is that wide receiver has one of the steepest learning curves in the NFL.   A lot of 1000+ yard receivers in the NFL today didn't kick it into gear until their third or so year. With all that being said, our young receivers have been constantly tossed around between Bradford, Austin and Hill for the past two years.   People will call me crazy but I think, especially under Schottenheimer's reign, Tavon Austin is still an unknown quantity. And if you really look at Bailey's stats, his biggest struggle is just being targeted. Then you have Quick and Britt who have obviously been good playmakers.   If we can keep Foles confident, upright and healthy for 16 games I think this unit could be more than comeptant."
StLouisRams,31j99s,FaulktheBlueRedbird,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:19:25 2015 UTC,"So I get this logic, but you think it's the WRs that aren't producing or the Oline/QB that are not giving them enough time."
StLouisRams,31j99s,Davidfreeze,7,Sun Apr 5 17:34:16 2015 UTC,"Obviously o line is the biggest need, but you don't draft guards at 10 overall. Great guards are available in the second and third. Great WR are gone by the second."
StLouisRams,31j99s,bwc_28,-3,Sun Apr 5 22:25:33 2015 UTC,We drafted a guard second overall last season.
StLouisRams,31j99s,Davidfreeze,12,Sun Apr 5 22:40:14 2015 UTC,You mean our left tackle who played guard while he developed into the left tackle we drafted him to be?
StLouisRams,31j99s,bwc_28,-9,Sun Apr 5 22:42:13 2015 UTC,"Yep, the guy who played guard last season and so far showed that as his best position."
StLouisRams,31j99s,Davidfreeze,9,Sun Apr 5 22:45:02 2015 UTC,Yeah the guy who played left tackle last season and is slotted to be a left tackle this season.
StLouisRams,31j99s,bwc_28,0,Sun Apr 5 22:47:48 2015 UTC,He still played better at guard than tackle last season. Whether or not he ends up being a decent LT he was slotted into guard and played better there than anywhere else.
StLouisRams,31j99s,Davidfreeze,9,Sun Apr 5 23:19:27 2015 UTC,But we didn't draft him to be a guard. The point is you don't draft someone in the top 10 with the intention of them being an interior lineman.
StLouisRams,31j99s,daedalus000,2,Sun Apr 5 23:26:26 2015 UTC,"Yup, you can take a Chance Warmack at 10 ala the Titans if you want a beastly interior, but teams almost always have more glaring needs than guard.  You gotta REALLY want that guard if you go top 10 with him.  Tackles though, they go every year in the top 10."
StLouisRams,31j99s,bwc_28,0,Sun Apr 5 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"We didn't draft him to play guard permanently, but Fish said almost immediately after the draft that he would be playing there last season. At the very least lineman who play guard at points in their career are drafted in the top 10. I get your point (career guards), and it happens very very rarely, but it does happens. Also I still dislike the Robinson pick and rarely miss an opportunity to bring it up."
StLouisRams,31j99s,vrock627,6,Sun Apr 5 23:31:47 2015 UTC,because its our 2nd biggest need? sure o line is obviously our no.1 need but if the talent isnt there at 10 and we cant find a good a trade why not take Amari Cooper?(if he is there)
StLouisRams,31j99s,bwc_28,2,Sun Apr 5 20:00:33 2015 UTC,It's debatably our second biggest need. O-Line then CB are bigger needs in my book. Trae Waynes would be a much more important pickup for us at 10 than Cooper or White.
StLouisRams,31j99s,xKeyNin,2,Sun Apr 5 22:39:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Quick showed that he can definitely be a number one option for us at WR. When Quick got injured, Britt stepped up and showed that he can be a good, solid receiver for us as well. And we haven't even seen what Tavon can do in the slot in this new system, nonetheless the fact that it's too early to give up on Tavon.  At CB, we really need help. Gaines is fucking good but after that, we don't have anybody that is safe at their spot on the depth chart other than maybe Jenkins. Johnson was average a couple years ago but he is just slow as hell. We need a new CB to put on the outside opposite Jenkins."
StLouisRams,31j99s,reddit_on_my_phone,3,Sun Apr 5 22:47:37 2015 UTC,Why does everyone in the sub hate jenkins? He's top 20 in the league in my opinion.
StLouisRams,31j99s,LLv2,5,Mon Apr 6 03:14:03 2015 UTC,It's the one giant touchdown mistake he gives up per game that is the problem.
StLouisRams,31j99s,One_Half_Hamster,6,Mon Apr 6 06:24:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, in my opinion he lacks the consistency and awareness to be considered an elite CB. I would love that to change though, and I do think he has the potential to change for the better."
StLouisRams,31j99s,porkfish66,1 point,Mon Apr 6 13:22:35 2015 UTC,"I don't hate him but he gambles too much. Scoring TDs shouldn't be a CB's top priority, he should focus on shutting down his man. Also, when he gets burned he lets it get to him. If he blew a play it takes him a while to get his head back in the game, and the other team takes advantage."
StLouisRams,31j99s,FaulktheBlueRedbird,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:11:51 2015 UTC,"Thinking about Greg Williams in his second year, picking up who we did in the offseason defensively (LB and DL depth added), Chris Long being healthy, and E.J. Gaines maturing + Trae Waynes to ice the hole in secondary has me salivating.   Fisher already said he was simplifying the defense. Imagine that secondary playing tight, simple coverage behind our D-Line."
StLouisRams,31j99s,bwc_28,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:30:16 2015 UTC,"Imagine that secondary playing tight, simple coverage behind our D-Line.   That's hard to imagine when we only have one consistently competent corner."
StLouisRams,31j99s,corbilm,5,Wed Apr 8 00:08:31 2015 UTC,"Quick's injury was serious, we have to hope he'll return to preinjury form before we can hope he will perform great; even is Quick is comfortable with the play book, there are things that he needs to work on like body positioning and using his leverage. Britt is solid, surprised me honestly, we were all like ""another fucking ex-Titan... Are you serious?"" But he's been solid. But if he out plays his contract this year, then he's opting out.  Britt has also had injury problems, arrests, and personal issues that have effected his time in the NFL.  Both Britt and Quick are big enough and agile enough to play either outside spot. Next up, Tavon Austin in the slot. I think he has great potential, but... We need to see at least some consistently before we can say we're comfortable at the slot.  Our WR4/#2slot is Stedman... And he is excelling with the opportunities he's given. He may even take over our WR2 role. But we're still gonna use our ""bigs"" package quite often. Which we rotate Cool into, which brings into question; how often do our TEs play in the receiving game: all the fucking time. Cook's first game with us showed that he could be truly remarkable. But he has since had trouble showing up consistently, although he has picked up steam recently. So what type of WR do we need? If we do draft a WR, I assume he'll be on the outside, some one that would have to be a OBJ/ instant starter type of athlete. Then we would have are true WR core plus depth. The big WR1, stud avg size WR2, and the speedster/route runner slot WR.  So if we do draft a WR, my guess is it will be someone that can compete immediately on the outside at the NFL level... That's Green-Beckham or Kevin White."
StLouisRams,31j99s,mcthsn,4,Sun Apr 5 17:51:49 2015 UTC,We need a playmaker.
StLouisRams,31j99s,bwc_28,3,Sun Apr 5 20:37:24 2015 UTC,Tavon's supposed to be the playmaker.
StLouisRams,31j99s,One_Half_Hamster,2,Sun Apr 5 22:37:18 2015 UTC,"And he very well may be if he starts being utilized properly, but at this point he is unproven as a playmaker."
StLouisRams,31j99s,LLv2,2,Mon Apr 6 13:23:40 2015 UTC,"I think we have three solid wideouts and a wild-card in Tavon Austin.  Quick could be a #1 and was on his way when he got injured.  Britt is a solid, big receiver who can do some damage.  And people keep forgetting about Stedman Bailey.  If they learn to use Tavon Austin correctly, he could also do good things.  I don't see it as a huge need at this time."
StLouisRams,31j99s,easternworm,2,Mon Apr 6 06:26:21 2015 UTC,Did everyone forget how much Stedman Bailey stepped up last year?
StLouisRams,31j99s,daedalus000,4,Mon Apr 6 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"I'm with you here.  I see a lot of mocks having us take a WR while it seems most of our fans are on board with OL.  To their credit I see lots of mocks prioritizing OL as well.  I really am comfortable with our WR corps and would love to see a solid guard and center drafted along with re-signing Barksdale.  Quick and Britt I think work really well together, and Quick should continue to emerge this year like he was last year, barring another injury."
StLouisRams,31j99s,ClitorisNigga,3,Sun Apr 5 17:18:11 2015 UTC,Because we havent had a true number 1 WR in almost a decade.
StLouisRams,31j99s,Chuy_3,2,Sun Apr 5 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"What's that mean though? We don't need a true #1 to win, look at the lions.  But I do agree with us not having a #1"
StLouisRams,31j99s,Chuy_3,2,Sun Apr 5 19:08:46 2015 UTC,what do you mean look at the lions?
StLouisRams,31j99s,mlasn,5,Sun Apr 5 21:05:48 2015 UTC,They have a true #1 but it isn't winning them a Super Bowl
StLouisRams,31j99s,bretris,2,Sun Apr 5 22:34:21 2015 UTC,Well they're sure as hell in a better position than we are to win a super bowl
StLouisRams,31j99s,stlp333,2,Sun Apr 5 22:59:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe, our defense could give us a better chance to win the superbowl.  But I'm more of a fan of taking bpa so if wr is that at 10 take it"
StLouisRams,31j99s,PRE_-CISION-_,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:05:15 2015 UTC,I think a WR to Rams in the first makes sense if you believe that player is BPA. Rams have a bunch of decent WR and not the biggest concern but if the FO sees somebody they really like drop to them I wouldn't be surprised.
StLouisRams,31j99s,DiscoJer,2,Mon Apr 6 00:13:26 2015 UTC,That's exactly what happened with Steven Jackson back in 2004.

Player Y is good with Z and that is enough to get us by! Nope... we been playing this game for to long without results now. It's time we go out and actually get a real threat.
StLouisRams,31gjuk,PectoralisMajor,7,Sat Apr 4 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"Well his skills are definitely a better fit in the Fisher/Williams scheme, so hopefully he turns into a major contributor.  But I still think we need to add a safety that is better in pass coverage."

StLouisRams,31gjuk,reddit_on_my_phone,2,Sun Apr 5 03:59:00 2015 UTC,TJ is one of the best in the league at covering TE's.
StLouisRams,31gjuk,iamlogan,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:16:07 2015 UTC,Graham is the best receiving TE in the game.
StLouisRams,31gjuk,kahyote484,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:52:28 2015 UTC,Never said he was or wasn't. Just saying that TJ is one of the best at covering TE's in the entire NFL.
StLouisRams,31gjuk,iamlogan,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:00:43 2015 UTC,I agree he was really good last year. He was not tested by someone of Graham's caliber though.
StLouisRams,31gjuk,kahyote484,7,Wed Apr 8 02:41:06 2015 UTC,I think we're solid at safety to be honest. McDonald is a fantastic all around SS and he'll be one of the best for years to come if he keeps up the progress from last season (his stats were as good or better than Ward and Chancellors last year). McLeod gave up a couple big plays early in the year but really picked it up as the season progressed and looked pretty good in coverage at the end the exception being against OBJ but who the fuck looks good against OBJ.
StLouisRams,31gbsd,FaulktheBlueRedbird,9,Sat Apr 4 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you wrote including the rookie jitters.  I think he is going to have a breakout season, and hopefully it doesn't take 4 or 5 games for things to 'click' for him.  Unfortunately, all my excitement for Robinson is outweighed by my concern for our three empty spots on the line.  Robinson and Saffold should both be solid (or better) players this year but Jackie Slater, Dennis Harrah, and three scrubs is still a bad offensive line.  What happened to moving Jake Long to Guard?  Why hasn't Barksdale been resigned?  Is Wisniewski even a possibility?  Can Barrett Jones go from the IR to the starting lineup?  Rhaney couldn't crack the lineup last year, how big a leap can we realistically expect this year?"
StLouisRams,31gbsd,DeniseDeNephew,3,Sat Apr 4 21:43:50 2015 UTC,"This. Barksdale and a Center are needed, IMMEDIATELY. Raines, Rhaney and Jones are backups/developmental guys. And we can fill ONE spot in the draft (guards tend to play quicker), but three? Come on."
StLouisRams,31gbsd,iamnyc,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:06:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you that Jones is a backup guy. He won award on top of awards at Bama. He can play. Injuries has slowed his progress, but I think he is ready to play C or G when his name is called."
StLouisRams,31gbsd,TacoxOFxBell,3,Sun Apr 5 00:31:22 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see him step in at guard! I think if we can snag Dismukes to play center in the draft, it will be a boon to both Greg and Mason!"
StLouisRams,31gbsd,The_Wayward,2,Sun Apr 5 00:50:31 2015 UTC,I like this scenario better than having Jones at Center.  Jones can play anywhere on the line so I'd like him to start at Guard (assuming he is both healthy and capable of starting) and be our backup Center.  I'd be more comfortable with that than having Jones at Center with I don't know who as his backup.  If someone has to play out of position in a pinch I'd rather have it be someone at Guard than at Center.
StLouisRams,31gbsd,DeniseDeNephew,2,Sun Apr 5 01:32:48 2015 UTC,"Cautiously optimistic. We've been burned before on the ""talented but raw player will take a major step forward this season, just you wait!"" front during Fisher's tenure. But as you said, GRob had very good reasons for his slowish start, and did flash great potential."

StLouisRams,31gbsd,bozo7337,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:29:42 2015 UTC,I think he's going to be a very good LT. He'll be a beast in the run game and have games against the elite DE's where he struggles. Never being as good in pass pro as run blocking.
StLouisRams,31gbsd,DiscoJer,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:58:11 2015 UTC,No. I don't think he's very good.
StLouisRams,31gbsd,Touch_of_Midas,2,Sat Apr 4 22:46:58 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with having an opinion.  Do you have some insight on why you feel that way?
StLouisRams,31gbsd,bwc_28,3,Sun Apr 5 03:10:29 2015 UTC,"Even in his good games last year he'd have several blown plays. I think he'll be good, but I in no way think he was worth the second overall pick. Unless he turns into a monster lineman who constantly makes the pro bowl (doubtful in St Louis) I think the Rams wildly blew that pick."
StLouisRams,31gbsd,Touch_of_Midas,3,Sun Apr 5 04:50:42 2015 UTC,"I think that's fair, he had a pretty rough first season.  We knew what we were getting into though, he was picked so high based on his potential because he really is a freak athlete.  He will have to show significant improvement this season to shake the critics.  But I do agree his first season was a little disappointing"
StLouisRams,31gbsd,bwc_28,3,Sun Apr 5 05:30:54 2015 UTC,"At the very least he's already proven that he's better than Smith. So at least there's that! I do think he'll be good, I just don't know how good yet."

StLouisRams,31fh4q,FaulktheBlueRedbird,9,Sat Apr 4 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Again, I don't give a shit about being a ""dirty"" team haha. We are in the age of a soft-NFL.   The 50's-80's and even the 90's were simply obscene. Overall, it's for the better that you can't stomp on someone's fingers or go out of your way to hurt other players.

StLouisRams,31fh4q,bozo7337,3,Sat Apr 4 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"I think that Bountygate worked out great for us.   Last season we saw how good a Williams defense can be.  This season it should be even better with the additions of Fairley and Ayers and the growth of our young players.  For any other team in the NFL this would be both a positive and a negative because whenever your offense of defense does really well there is a good chance that your Coordinator leaves to become a Head Coach somewhere.  But we don't have to worry about that, unlike everyone else.  Williams isn't going anywhere as long as we still want him (and keep Fisher).  Nobody will offer him a Head Coaching position and even if they did the NFL may at least discourage it if not outright disallow it.  And I think we can decline any other team from interviewing him for an equivalent position.  We could have a top 5 defense this season and not have to worry about him leaving."
StLouisRams,31fh4q,PRE_-CISION-_,2,Sat Apr 4 21:17:34 2015 UTC,He blitzes too much and isn't exactly creative in his blitzes he telegraphs them. Also his teams in the past have developed a lack of tackle discipline. We saw some bad tackling last year here as well.

StLouisRams,31dtow,New_DudeToo,2,Sat Apr 4 03:18:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think the Collins, Peat, Flowers, and Clemmings are all mid to late 1st round lineman. If Scherff isn't there at 10, we should trade back to later in the first round and take one of other lineman."
StLouisRams,31dtow,edubs_stl,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:07:51 2015 UTC,Unless a great receiver is available. Great interior lineman can be had in the second and third rounds.
StLouisRams,31dtow,Davidfreeze,2,Sat Apr 4 21:15:12 2015 UTC,"It always seems like the difference between O-Linemen in the 1st-3rd rounds is way smaller than other positions.   On top of that, where we heard nothing but immense hype over Robinson, Matthews, and even Lewan last year, the talk surrounding Scherff hasn't been too exciting. I feel like he's just the best in a very weak class of OTs.   I'd rather take Trae Waynes to truly ice the defensive side of things. Imagine adding Akeem Ayers, Nick Fairley, and Trae Waynes this offseason. Then E.J. Gaines in his second year to match up with Trae.   Go beef up on OT's 2nd-3rd rounds and see what sticks. Scherff isn't a once in a lifetime guy."
StLouisRams,31dtow,FaulktheBlueRedbird,3,Sat Apr 4 19:26:04 2015 UTC,"I think you're under valuing Scherff. He will be a guard,  not a tackle. He will be an elite guard in a couple seasons. I agree that Trae could make our defense unbelievable, but I think if our best options are gone, Miami will trade us to leap frog Minnesota to get Waynes."

Hell, I'd be fine with making a big trade with one of the tail-end teams to swap firsts, get their 2015 second, and 2016 third.  We could still get some great OL talent in the late 20s and have extra picks to work with."
StLouisRams,31dtow,TB_Punters,2,Sat Apr 4 15:12:02 2015 UTC,With the way that board fell he or La'el Collins would be the ideal pick. I expect a trade down to the 15-25 range though.
StLouisRams,31dtow,bozo7337,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:05:55 2015 UTC,Both off the board the top two QB's off the board and a team in that range needing an edge rusher offers to trade up. Depending on how far they trade down it could net an extra 2nd and possibly a mid/late 2016 pick.
StLouisRams,31dtow,bozo7337,-1,Sat Apr 4 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"With the recent success of last year’s Cowboys offensive line, many teams may try to mimic the strategy by investing premium picks on offensive lineman   Really, he wants me to take him seriously with that statement?"

StLouisRams,319h2x,squadup1017,3,Fri Apr 3 01:51:44 2015 UTC,If we're gonna pick up a receiver to add to the stable id rather grab Crabtree. Younger more upside and by now his price has gone way down. Just me though.

The only reason we're considering Cooper or White as targets is because they may be the best player available at the time we're picking, and they can develop into our #1 WR. We don't need a #1 that will be around another year or two tops."
StLouisRams,319h2x,Sauceman87,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:23:43 2015 UTC,Waste what little cap space we have on a 34 or 35 year old receiver to take away plays from our young guys? No thanks I'll save the cap for OLine.
StLouisRams,319h2x,bozo7337,0,Fri Apr 3 15:22:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe 2 years ago but his last injury really showed to take a step or two away. The receiver position would be a hard task to manage as a rams coach ATM.  So many young guys that have loads of talent.  I'm not ready to give up on Tavon,  but at the same time Stedman seems to be the better NFL player right now.  As far as Quick and Britt,  I say we get rid one of the two."
StLouisRams,319h2x,Daytwa313,3,Fri Apr 3 11:49:40 2015 UTC,If we get rid of anybody on our receiving corps it needs to be Givens.

StLouisRams,319h2x,Daytwa313,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:37:58 2015 UTC,Really?  Get rid of quick or Britt?  I think either if them will play better this year in our system than any wideout on the market.
StLouisRams,319h2x,librarianC,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:12:43 2015 UTC,"How much is that saying though given who's left on the market?  Quick is entering his 4th year and has 800 or so career yards. Britt has like 5-6 seasons under his belt and has never has reached even 800 in a season.  Drop Quick,  and draft a receiver with the 9th pick in the second round"
StLouisRams,319h2x,Daytwa313,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:13:05 2015 UTC,"Britt and Quick were both drafted either in the 1st or 2nd round. who is to say this ""new"" receiver is going to do any better in this system... The rams are a run first team that has had backup QBs for the last 2 seasons. Even if we had an amazing WR1 they wouldn't have much  better numbers than Britt had last season. And if Quick never got hurt he could of had great numbers too. This was the first time Quick finally got the playbook and route running down. He was an inexperienced receiver coming out of college with a very high ceiling due to his size/speed/catching ability. I think he is finally figuring out everything else it takes to be a good WR in the NFL. We have to give him another chance before letting him go, he finally was starting to learn route running and knowing the playbook before he went down. He was looking awesome at the start of the season. All of our receivers other than Britt are really young, all unproven talent. They haven't really got their chance due to the fact we haven't had the best OC or the most reliable QB in a few years.  Drafting a receiver can be risky in the NFL because no1 really knows how fast they are going to catch on to the playbook and the Pace of being an NFL WR right away. Some get it right away, and some just don't."
StLouisRams,319h2x,RamsWillFly,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:08:52 2015 UTC,Are we really Considering the 700 yards britt got the rams great numbers?  Mike Evans seems to do fine without a Qb.  Josh Gordon dominated without a good qb.  The game changers are out there.
StLouisRams,318soh,chemicalpoisons,3,Thu Apr 2 22:21:20 2015 UTC,Seems odd that we're the only team in the league without a mandatory minicamp
StLouisRams,318soh,birdmandersen,3,Fri Apr 3 04:21:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I've always wondered why that is.
StLouisRams,318soh,CallOnTyrone,2,Fri Apr 3 04:36:28 2015 UTC,Fish has said that he doesn't want to over work the players.
StLouisRams,318soh,DougFunLove,5,Fri Apr 3 04:45:30 2015 UTC,"After seeing the team come out as flat as it did last season I think he needs to rethink this philosophy.  When was the last season where you saw the offense look sharp and in-sync during the first 3 games?  They always seem to start the year looking like a team playing their second preseason game, they do not look prepared.   Maybe with a mandatory minicamp they won't have one sack after the first 5 games.   They didn't look overworked they looked underworked."
StLouisRams,318soh,DeniseDeNephew,2,Fri Apr 3 07:00:52 2015 UTC,I agree. It's happened almost every year Fish has been with the rams.
StLouisRams,318soh,DougFunLove,1 point,Fri Apr 3 15:17:02 2015 UTC,They also finish the season as the hottest team in the league. Because they have been underworked at the start. Two seasons in a row that I know of that our defense and running game were top 5 in last 5 or 6 games of the season.
StLouisRams,318soh,NewBroPewPew,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"I like that the camp isn't mandatory, it shows you which players really care. If they care they'll be in camp."

As for ""Wisneigkjfdsla;gski"", I don't see us signing the guy.  He's in Jacksonville now (have crazy cash to spend), seems about 5 other teams are highly interested.  Coming off his rookie relatively cheap deal, it looks like he wants to get paid.  The market isn't what he thought it would be for him, but I still think he is looking for the money."

The draft experts here have already said that Snead will trade down and then trade down again, and then draft quality OL starters with picks in the 5th, 6th, and 7th rounds.  Our line will be set for the next decade.  They said so.  I'm worried.    Barksdale, where the hell are you?  The honeymoon is over, time to resign.  If we couldn't count on Bradford staying healthy how can we count on Barrett Jones?  I don't see a lot of depth there.  I know it's still early but I really, really don't want to head into the draft needing to draft 3 offensive linemen.  It's better for the long-term health of your team to draft BPA instead of drafting for need but you can only do that if your needs aren't glaring needs, and ours are.  If we can at least sign Barksdale and 1 other starter I'll be happy when the draft starts."

StLouisRams,315arw,CC2560,6,Thu Apr 2 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Foles ""game manager""-ness might be better suited to Fisher's game. Thanks for the info.     Like most QBs, B is better with a good OL. However, I think the gap between good-OL-Bradford and bad-OL-Bradford is bigger than average. Healthy, he's in the top half of QBs. Of course, that's the rub, right? ""Healthy"".  From the vantage point of my couch, it seems that Foles is a better FIT for the Rams than Bradford is for you guys. (Note the emphasis on ""FIT""... not saying one is a better QB than the other)"
StLouisRams,315arw,SQLDave,2,Thu Apr 2 17:18:08 2015 UTC,"Foles definitely has a pretty big drop off when the o-line struggles as well. Like I said, my take on him is that he should probably take sacks when getting rushed unless he absolutely needs to convert cause he's so terrible throwing on the run and can't extend plays.   That said, I have a lot of concern about Bradford as a fit for us, but a lot of it is predicated on the preconceived notion that a mobile QB is very important for Kelly's system. I'm startling to come around to the possibility that he's telling the truth when he says that's pretty far down the list of attributes he looks for."
StLouisRams,315arw,qp0n,6,Thu Apr 2 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"Nick Foles  Strengths:   Arm strength  Height re: vision, doesn't have to adjust or scramble to see throwing lanes High release (very few passes get batted down) Very accurate on deep balls with great trajectory, especially to WRs with separation. Maclin & DJax took full advantage of this. Toughness. He can take a beating and get back up every time. Will never complain about it. Very smart. Will get every concept he is asked. Makes fairly good presnap reads. Leadership, of the more quiet variety. Part of which derives from that toughness Great teammate, locker room guy Seemingly clutch But his biggest strength is definitely his resilience. The kid simply has no capacity for defeatism; he will never stop believing he & his team will succeed and that he can make every throw.   That last fact leads him to take a lot of risks, which is definitely a double-edged sword.  Weaknesses:   Backpeddling. By far Nick Foles' biggest weakness is a seemingly unbreakable bad habit to backpedal from a pocket and throwing off-balance, instead of stepping into the pocket & his throws. Just fair warning if this habit continues to reveal itself next season.  Holds onto the ball too long. This can be a result of any number of things, but I generally think it is because he simply prefers throwing deeper routes instead of settling for short completions. He is very accurate with the deep ball but he seems to want to throw it too much. I believe ""gunslinger"" is the term, and the drawbacks that come with it. This contributes to all that 'backpeddling' and vice versa. No matter how many people try to tell you he is an ""underrated athlete"" or ""you might not realize it but Nick is a great athlete"" ... don't believe it. He is slow and lanky with the agility of an aircraft carrier. This isn't a huge problem as long as he isn't asked to do things that require his legs... but the reality is that he is not going to escape pressure very often by eluding tackles. He tends to take a lot of sacks. Not very accurate on the move, though rarely an issue because he simply isn't on the move very often. Not a particularly crafty player, wont draw defenses offsides (re: Luck) or fool defenders that often by selling fakes / play action. Can't create a play when the play breaks down.     There's more I could say probably but that's the meat of him as a player. If there's anything else anyone wants to know feel free to ask. Good luck in 2015 and as always Fuck the Cowboys.

The Eagles offensive line sucked under Buddy Ryan and was only marginally better under Kotite.  Then Reid came in with a strong line and everything changed.  I was only waiting a decade for that to happen. FYI, Fisher is a Ryan protege.  I love him as a coach, but his offenses have been up and down over the years."
StLouisRams,315arw,darwinn_69,3,Thu Apr 2 18:26:58 2015 UTC,"Nick is a workhorse of a quarter back. He's about as graceful as a giraffe doing ballet and can't slid for shit. Some say he saw ghosts of pressure, I think he's just very awkward with his footwork overall. He makes good decisions most of the time, and has good arm strength and touch. One of the things you'll like is his consistency, not much phases him and he can come back clutch in key situations. He isn't a RaRaRa team leader type, he's more of the silent professional type. I wouldn't compare him to Manning/Rogers in that his presence alone will make the whole team better, but he definitely won't be a liability if you build a team/system that he can work with."
StLouisRams,315arw,pitcher_10,2,Thu Apr 2 18:52:54 2015 UTC,"""Awkward"" That's the perfect word to describe him, on or off the field. That pro-bowl mvp speech he gave was awkward as fuck, his press conferences I always found a little bit awkward. Hell his twitter is game is very awkward too. His style of play is absolutely awkward, but that's probably because he has little to no mobility."

StLouisRams,315arw,Afabrain,2,Fri Apr 3 00:59:00 2015 UTC,"I'll give my brief take on Foles. One of the luxuries that he has given the Eagles and Rams is that we've seen him at both his best and his worst. 27-2 was impressive in 2013 and in contrast his performance last season before he got hurt he was struggling with a few issues with confidence in the pocket and accuracy and mechanics. That being said, his ""poor performance"" last season was better than a lot of other QB's in the league. So his ceiling is high and so is his floor in my opinion, at worst he's going to be around the Dalton line, good enough to continue to build a solid team around before pulling the trigger on a stud prospect for QB in a few years and obviously at best you've got a future HOFer.    I think the reason for trading him was mostly scheme fit and the fact with our coaching staff he hadn't been able to fix his mechanic issues that have been the same his entire career, even going back to the last half of 2012 when Reid was still in charge and during the 27-2 run. I really think you guys got a really good deal getting him and the 2nd rounder, I was fully content with going into next season with him as our starter."
StLouisRams,315arw,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:35:06 2015 UTC,Sweet mercy that Redskins hit was late dirty as shit. I hope it resulted in a 15 yard penalty.
StLouisRams,315arw,qp0n,4,Thu Apr 2 21:22:49 2015 UTC,"Don't tell /r/NFL that, some NFL official later loosely ruled it was a clean hit & the hivemind fell in line. I still to this day refuse to accept any rule or ruling that that is an acceptable or clean hit. It was obviously a blatant attempt to put an opportunistic punishing blindside hit on the QB ... and no one else."
StLouisRams,315arw,BrawndoTTM,7,Thu Apr 2 04:06:31 2015 UTC,"I get how it's hard to fault it in purely technical terms, but all you have to do is fucking look at it to see that it was extremely dirty. I mean, I could see if Foles was barrelling down to tackle the guy, but he was practically strolling, and #25 was far closer and in a better position to make the tackle. At that point in the game, he was no more involved in the play on the field than a ref."
StLouisRams,315arw,qp0n,5,Thu Apr 2 20:05:00 2015 UTC,The player with the ball was literally downed before the hit too.
StLouisRams,315arw,Ztbill,5,Thu Apr 2 20:12:47 2015 UTC,"Fun Fact: Jason Peters was fined more ($10,000) for retaliating to that hit and started a fight. Then, Chris Baker didn't get fined for the hit, but got fined $8,000 for facemasking during the brawl."
StLouisRams,315arw,crackalac,3,Thu Apr 2 20:28:18 2015 UTC,"It looks like a really late hit. What really happened was that Foles had just thrown an interception (after review it was actually an incomplete pass) and Foles was just kind of jogging toward the sideline, but that hit was technically a ""block"" as the ballcarrier was headed in Foles' direction.  Nonetheless it resulted in a 15 yard penalty and the guy was ejected from the game. But so was one of our guys for punching him in the face multiple times after the play. Kind of an interesting brawl, here's full video: http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000398172/article/eagles-jason-peters-redskins-chris-baker-ejected-after-melee"
StLouisRams,315arw,darwinn_69,0,Thu Apr 2 20:06:16 2015 UTC,It should be clean but he was flagged due to the stupid warren sapp rule.
StLouisRams,315arw,crackalac,2,Thu Apr 2 12:34:07 2015 UTC,"It was indeed a technically clean hit, but a dick move. I feel like the refs were being a little bit activist, trying to send a message more than actually enforcing the letter of the law."
StLouisRams,315arw,kruksog,3,Thu Apr 2 16:29:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, it was a legal hit technically. However, there is no doubt in my mind Baker knew what he was doing. They had to eject Peters for the response, but if Baker wasn't ejected as well he'd have a huge target on his back the rest of the game. They didn't want to deal with fights all game so just get the troublemakers gone and get it over with."
StLouisRams,315arw,the_logistician,2,Thu Apr 2 18:04:14 2015 UTC,Oh Baker definitely knew what he was doing. He probably weighs twice as much as Nick. Could have picked Nick up with one arm and gently placed him on the ground. There was no need whatsoever to hit the QB with that kind of force when he no longer had the ball.
StLouisRams,315arw,One_Half_Hamster,-4,Thu Apr 2 18:17:18 2015 UTC,There was no need whatsoever to hit the QB with that kind of force when he no longer had the ball.    This is why I struggle to watch the nfl lately. That was an ideal block back when I was playing. It's the equivalent of going hard into 2nd in baseball.
StLouisRams,315arw,the_logistician,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"I know the league has already ruled this a clean hit and that (obviously) it's their say.  But I just re-watched this game, and there was something that I hadn't noticed before: the Washington player who ""intercepted"" it was in the process of being tackled when the hit was made.  Like, not just getting wrapped up.  Long since wrapped up and clearly headed for the dirt.  I don't have the moment in front of me right now, but I feel like he was down when the hit was made.  It was close.  Real close.  I know you already agree that it was absolutely dirty, but I think a lot of us has forgotten just how dirty it was.  I personally still think it was a late hit, but whatever.  Not my call."
StLouisRams,315arw,qp0n,-1,Thu Apr 2 19:01:50 2015 UTC,Good luck with Bradford.  Wanted to retire twice in his NFL career.  I expect after a big hit he will regret not taking himself off of the field.
StLouisRams,315arw,Yji,2,Thu Apr 2 19:01:23 2015 UTC,"I had heard that but interestingly enough one comment Chip Kelly made is that Bradford is ""an unbelievable competitor"". When he was on the field did you see him lacking passion and competitiveness at all? I understand a guy contemplating walking away when he's out for 22 straight months, but I'd be devastated if he's a quitter on the field."
StLouisRams,315arw,qp0n,4,Thu Apr 2 12:42:10 2015 UTC,"As far as lacking passion goes, he is a very silent presence. I'm not saying he doesn't have passion, it's just not all that visible."
StLouisRams,315arw,the_logistician,2,Thu Apr 2 12:47:08 2015 UTC,"I was going to say, if that is the case than I didn't see it.  I think that he needs a motivational coach like a Chip Kelly rather than a 'do your job and see results' style that Jeff Fisher had."
StLouisRams,315arw,heavenfromhell,2,Thu Apr 2 13:34:28 2015 UTC,Ditto Foles
StLouisRams,315arw,darwinn_69,3,Thu Apr 2 13:45:12 2015 UTC,"He's definitely no quitter. He's a competitor. He's not going to scream and shout but he wants to win, that's for sure."
StLouisRams,315arw,qp0n,2,Thu Apr 2 19:06:22 2015 UTC,The optimist in me wants to believe that he won't be so easily disenfranchised with college buddy roommate DeMarco around.
StLouisRams,313k06,ACCA_,10,Wed Apr 1 19:29:34 2015 UTC,Cooper is best-case scenario IMO. He's a beast.
StLouisRams,313k06,That_Fat_Black_Guy,6,Wed Apr 1 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"I really want us to go OL in the first round, but I wouldn't be mad if he fell to us and was our pick."
StLouisRams,313k06,Ihateunerds,3,Thu Apr 2 00:12:57 2015 UTC,WR1 and O line are our biggest needs. There is no passing on him if by some miracle he's there. You can get lineman in later rounds. You can't get stud WRs.
StLouisRams,313k06,FaulktheBlueRedbird,4,Thu Apr 2 04:41:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Scherff is the best OL in this draft, but that doesn't mean he's a once in a lifetime pick. I think he would have gone very late 1st, very early 2nd last year."
StLouisRams,313k06,mustaine42,3,Thu Apr 2 05:57:59 2015 UTC,"Right. The next OL prospects aren't that far behind him either. Plus, G at #10 is a huge reach and RT at #10 is still a bit of a reach, unless the player is elite. Scherff still has his flaws.  I have the feeling that Cooper will fall for some reason though. I think he would undisputedly be BPA at #10."
StLouisRams,313k06,FaulktheBlueRedbird,2,Thu Apr 2 15:36:29 2015 UTC,"I prefer impact players over ""needs"" in the draft anyway.   The Texans certainly didn't need Clowney. But who were they not to take him? Once in a decade opportunity. Take someone who will make the biggest impact, even if that's not an immediate ""need"".   Take two OLs in the second-third rounds if you have to."
StLouisRams,313k06,bwc_28,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:40:00 2015 UTC,I don't understand how so many people think WR is a bigger need of ours than CB. Quick looked very good before he got injured and bringing Britt back makes our WRs a decent group. Our CBs last year were abysmal outside of Gaines. I would much rather we pick Trae Waynes or Marcus Peters than a WR. If both Waynes and Cooper were there at 10 I wouldn't hesitate to pick Waynes.
StLouisRams,313k06,Daytwa313,3,Thu Apr 2 17:11:20 2015 UTC,He has his haters but I'm all for Janoris
StLouisRams,313k06,bwc_28,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:25:06 2015 UTC,If he could stop with dumb mistakes every game I'd love him. But he always gambles and it seems 90% of the time guesses wrong.
StLouisRams,313k06,mcthsn,3,Fri Apr 3 18:40:29 2015 UTC,Heck yes!
StLouisRams,313k06,One_Half_Hamster,3,Wed Apr 1 21:22:24 2015 UTC,It is nice to know that Fisher and Snead are possibly interested him acquiring him.  Now we just have to hope he sticks around that long in the draft.
StLouisRams,313k06,OldOrder,2,Wed Apr 1 21:39:16 2015 UTC,God I want this guy on the team so bad. Really think with Quick and Cooper in the edges and Austin running around in the slot we could have a decent passing attack this year.
StLouisRams,313k06,crackalac,2,Thu Apr 2 15:12:42 2015 UTC,I think I'd rather flip the pick and grab DGB later.

StLouisRams,311k33,asdfqwerasdfqwerasdf,7,Wed Apr 1 11:10:35 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it, the more I think I'd rather go OL in the first and draft a WR later. There are enough good WRs in this draft that I think you can get one in the second and still be fine.  Obviously it's different if Amari Cooper were available (which he won't be). But you get a good OL, then go WR later and maybe QB later and I'll be okay."
StLouisRams,311k33,StickerBrush,5,Wed Apr 1 13:06:32 2015 UTC,"The thing about McShay and Kiper's mocks is that they don't trade. I believe in this scenario, if Scherff, White, Cooper and the QBs  are taken,  we will trade back. There is a lot of good OL talent in this draft as well."
StLouisRams,311k33,New_DudeToo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:17:39 2015 UTC,How far back do you think we'd be able to trade? Are there guys beyond the ones you mentioned that teams are willing to move up to draft?
StLouisRams,311k33,TurtlesAndTrees,2,Wed Apr 1 15:52:51 2015 UTC,Someone looking only at talent may want to jump up for DGB
StLouisRams,311k33,Davidfreeze,5,Wed Apr 1 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"DGB is a talent - you can't deny it, but no team is going to risk a first round pick for another Josh Gordon"
StLouisRams,311k33,dah00psta,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:30:08 2015 UTC,Plenty of mocks have him late first round. His measurables are absolutely insane.
StLouisRams,311k33,Davidfreeze,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:31:53 2015 UTC,"I think if Waynes is there someone would trade up for him. I think Vikings and Miami would trade up for Waynes. I know the Vikes pick 11th, but the could move up 1 spot to solidify Waynes so Miami doesn't jump them. If we get a 3rd or 4th rounder and trade 1st's with one of those teams, I think we would do it"
StLouisRams,311k33,New_DudeToo,3,Wed Apr 1 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"I just don't ever believe they'll ever take a receiver, I feel it's not smart at all. Les Snead and Jeff Fisher know they have enough talent at wide receiver to let that stay, well for at least the early rounds. The OLine doesn't even have 5 starters yet. The only prominent lineman we have is Saffold. Greg Robinson is an unknown, but talented guy. Is he gonna play LT or are we gonna draft a LT because they dont believe in him? There's so many unknowns, that I could almost see a first and second round OLine pick."
StLouisRams,311k33,gohemis,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:59:39 2015 UTC,"They took a slot, gadget WR at 8.  Completely plausible and realistic they would take White or Cooper if they are there at 10."

StLouisRams,311k33,bozo7337,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:33:02 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh he's an elite talent to me. I like him better than Watkins, Blackmon, and Evans and we see where they went. I think the white talk is all hype and he will go top 5"
StLouisRams,311k33,Soaring_Seagull24,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"If they're both available at the 10 spot, could someone explain to me why we should take Cooper over Scherff?    I love the idea of us drafting a WR, but I know we have a few holes in our oline so could somebody change my view?"
StLouisRams,30yjx0,pleasexplain,12,Tue Mar 31 19:16:18 2015 UTC,This makes sense to me. When you have the talent up front the Rams do you really don't have to scheme that hard to get results. Just let your hunters up front do what they do and play smart behind them and they'll have a top 10 defense in their sleep.
StLouisRams,30yjx0,fake_sagan,5,Tue Mar 31 19:55:29 2015 UTC,Williams just need to keep doing whatever he was doing the second half of the season. If that means simplifying then I'm all for it. But good Lord that was a shit show the first half of the year.
StLouisRams,30yjx0,To3z,6,Tue Mar 31 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"He was constantly trying to scheme with tricky blitz packages, and he didn't understand how to best utilize the players he had.

We'd be replacing Nick Foles with the pick, and Kenny Britt while nice should be no means be the guy who keeps the Rams from getting the number one overall pick.

He's a great player, and definitely one of my favorite human beings in the NFL, but his on-field productivity doesn't match his contract value. I think we cut him and then some other team overpays for him."
StLouisRams,30w9to,BrawndoTTM,4,Tue Mar 31 16:02:06 2015 UTC,i think he takes a paycut to stay here
StLouisRams,30w9to,vrock627,10,Tue Mar 31 15:19:46 2015 UTC,"Nah, I think Chris retires here.  He's the leader of the defense (along with Laurinitis), he's the veteran presence on the team.  Other guys look up to him, especially the rest of the extremely young D-line.  He's also a fan favorite, and put up horrible numbers last season because he went down week six (keep in mind our D-lines lack of production across the boards weeks 1-5).  Put up 8.5 sacks two seasons ago, which is production I think he can match this season.  Him and Bradford are completely different, because Long hasn't had the same injury history, and if Long went down the season wouldn't be down the drain.  Long's a fan favorite, and I wouldn't be surprised if he signed a more team friendly contract after this one.  I think and hope he will retire a Ram."

If he digresses this season and has something like 4 sacks, 25 tackles, and zero turnovers OR if he is injured again, I think he'd take a considerable pay cut, as no one else would offer him anything spectacular.   If he comes out and has the best season of his career with 15 sacks, 40 tackles, a few turnovers, etc. we pay to keep him.   If he does average Chris Long numbers I think there's a 50/50 shot we let him go."

StLouisRams,3106kp,pleasexplain,-3,Wed Apr 1 03:25:43 2015 UTC,If I had traded Tavon Austin instead of Quinn would you have been mad?

StLouisRams,3106kp,jjangness,-5,Wed Apr 1 03:48:13 2015 UTC,"I think most of the people here are overvaluing Quinn. Like yeah, he's an amazing player. But DE isn't the most important position. Look at Dallas, we got rid of Demarcus Ware and our run defense even improves. And we finally broke our mediocrity streak."

StLouisRams,3106kp,MathBeaudet,-2,Wed Apr 1 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"Why pay 16m to one DE, who got 10.5 sacks, when you can pay 6 million to 2 DE who will get 6-8 sacks each. I don't care who you are, no defensive player is worth that much. You need to have a franchise QB before you deal out that money. Look at teams that spend to much on defensive players, Miami(Suh), Jets(Revis), Rams (Quinn). All those yes are mediocre at best. Hell, when Dallas was paying for Ware we were mediocre, we finally stop pay huge amounts for him and look, we get the best record in the league."
StLouisRams,3106kp,jjangness,2,Wed Apr 1 10:58:43 2015 UTC,We don't pay 16$ million.  We pay him less than 11$ million till 2020.....  He had an off year last year.  But can be expected at 15 sacks a year.  So triple the production for double the money.  I don't get where you keep coming up stuff without looking it up.  We have Quinn on a great contract till 2020
StLouisRams,3106kp,geckoswan,-2,Wed Apr 1 11:20:03 2015 UTC,"Well, from a quick Google search, he's a $16m cap hit in 2015."

Take Irving or La'el Collins in the 1st. In the 2nd take Agholor and Grayson. In the 3rd take Laken Tomlinson. In the 4th take Reese Dismukes(or a tackle like Symbrillo if we go Irving round 1) and a DT or ILB if we pick up a 2nd 4th. In the 6th with our projected comp pick take CB Celiscar. 7th round bpa whatever you want.
StLouisRams,30vl4t,Demonthehusky,-1,Tue Mar 31 01:48:16 2015 UTC,There are not many notable tenth overall draft picks historically. Would be worth it to trade down and get an extra early pick.

StLouisRams,30r21a,DeniseDeNephew,6,Sun Mar 29 23:52:20 2015 UTC,"I have a question about the financial plan for the new stadium.  Let's say the people vote to fund their part of the stadium so the public funds are secured.  That leaves ~450 million dollars, 200 million from the NFL's G-4 program and 250 million from Kroenke.  But what if at that point Kroenke says no?  Can anyone force him to pay the $250 million for a stadium he does not want, in a city he does not want to be in?  And if he does not pay then the G-4 funding falls through because it requires a minimum 200 million dollar contribution from the team and only he can make that contribution.    It seems unlikely that Peacock could create a financial plan that includes a quarter of a billion dollars of someone else's money without that someone else's consent but maybe there's something in the current agreement between Kroenke and the city that I don't know about.   Does anyone have any real answers for this?"
StLouisRams,30r21a,Magnemmike,8,Mon Mar 30 09:16:01 2015 UTC,"How do you force anyone to pay the funds?   Peacock has already said that they cannot continue without a team committed. -no funding -no team  Probably best option now is to lure another team (chargers, raiders) to the dome."
StLouisRams,30r21a,DeniseDeNephew,8,Mon Mar 30 10:34:14 2015 UTC,"What you're saying makes sense but I keep reading that if they can secure the public money then the NFL ""can't let them leave"".   But unless we're both wrong, or unless Kroenke wants to stay in St. Louis, then it seems like the city literally can't secure the funds.  So I'm wondering if someone with a different view of things can give a logical explanation of how the Peacock plan would ever work.  Thanks for answering though, the downvote brigade seems to have you targeted here so I appreciate you literally 'taking one for the team'."
StLouisRams,30r21a,bozo7337,9,Mon Mar 30 10:58:59 2015 UTC,Also the G4 comes from an NFL fun but it's a loan to the teams owner so Kroenke will be required to pay it back. So in reality it's 450 million you're trying to talk Kroenke into paying for a stadium he won't own or have final say in. You're going to have the same situation 10-20 years down the road when the new stadium needs upgrades to continue to be viable. I'm all for owners paying 100% of the stadiums for their teams. I feel if you can't afford the house they play in you can't afford the team. Fortunately the Rams have such an owner. Unfortunately for people in St Louis he wants to build their house in LA.
StLouisRams,30r21a,SoulardSTL,4,Mon Mar 30 12:08:11 2015 UTC,"I've heard that G4 is pretty much fully forgivable, a de facto $200M capital outlay that teams have not historically repaid and is a ""loan"" in name only. If I'm wrong, I'd like to learn more of which teams have repaid their G4 loans, not being snarky, really would like to know because I haven't heard of it."
StLouisRams,30r21a,bozo7337,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"Well so far to my knowledge only 2 teams have used the funds the Vikings and the Niners. Miami might apply for the loan for renovations to be able to host a Super Bowl. This article discussing the Miami situation also quotes the Dolphins CEO as saying they're obligated to pay it back.   http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-04-14/sports/fl-dolphins-stadium-0415-20130414_1_dolphins-ceo-mike-dee-miami-dolphins-nfl  It's only available to stadiums that use both public and private money to build. Not sure where the info it's forgivable comes from other than speculation. It's supposed to come from team revenues from ticket/psl sales and is paid back over 15 years I believe I read. The owner is on the hook to pay the loan back, from proceeds the team would normally pocket."
StLouisRams,30r21a,SoulardSTL,3,Mon Mar 30 19:45:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that source. Stories I've read regarding the new Vikings & Falcons stadiums have described the G4 as a forgivable instrument, essentially grants by the League for home markets to fund their facilities (from partial redevelopments to full-on reconstruction). Then again, 15-year term fixed loans, with no interest charges and no consideration for inflation... Got to say that's pretty close to free money."
StLouisRams,30r21a,Magnemmike,4,Mon Mar 30 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that.  Honestly, thanks."
StLouisRams,30r21a,Popolar,3,Mon Mar 30 12:28:45 2015 UTC,"The whole idea that the NFL 'can't leave' a city that's willing to dish out public finding is more so on the ethical side of things. If the NFL leaves a city that is actively trying to keep an NFL team, that looks real bad on the NFL and is a big FUCK YOU to the people of said city."
StLouisRams,30r21a,DeniseDeNephew,4,Mon Mar 30 13:47:19 2015 UTC,"a city that is actively trying to keep an NFL team   So what I've read before was basically, ""If we build it, they must stay"" and now it sounds like, ""If we show that we're willing to pay a percentage of it, they must stay"".   It still doesn't answer my original question.  If the city extends the bonds on the EJD to borrow 350 million, who can force Kroenke to pay the rest?  Can the NFL force him to?  Can the city?  You have three entities here -- the Owner (Kroenke), the NFL/Goodell, and the City.  We know who the literal Owner is but who really owns the team?   If the city can borrow 350 million and by doing so force the NFL to disallow any move AND force the Owner of the team to pay 250 million of his own money, then the city seems like the real Owner and Kroenke is just managing the team for them.  Does anyone believe that is true?  Or is the NFL the real owner, and they can force Kroenke to not move AND force him to pay 250 million?  Does anyone believe that is true?  In both scenarios someone is making Kroenke pay 250 million of his own money."
StLouisRams,30r21a,Popolar,2,Tue Mar 31 02:11:02 2015 UTC,"Like I said, it's an ethical thing. Yes, Kroenke owns the team and he does have the power to move it, but it would hurt the NFL's image for the NFL to leave St. Louis while the city is making an effort to keep the team.   I'm not saying that the team can't be moved, I'm just saying that if Kroenke does try to do so without the NFL's permission, he is going to be facing a lot of opposition from both the NFL and St. Louis. That has not really ever happened before, with both the city and the league opposing a move. It would look bad for an NFL team to just up and leave a city that still wants them for better profit.   On a semi-related note, Kroenke still has not directly said that he intends to move the Rams away from St. Louis, although on the surface it appears that his intention is to move."
StLouisRams,30r21a,DeniseDeNephew,4,Tue Mar 31 02:38:22 2015 UTC,"On a semi-related note, Kroenke still has not directly said that he intends to move the Rams away from St. Louis   That's very true, we don't know his intentions."

He could have a couple of different plans of action based on how the situation develops, but Silent Stan is a persistent man. I don't think he will announce anything until it is a for sure go, and who knows when that will be.   Or, he just wants to cash in on one more season in STL before moving. I don't know."
StLouisRams,30r21a,bozo7337,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:58:04 2015 UTC,But we keep hearing and seeing evidence that they're not willing to use public funding. The state legislature is trying to prevent it. We've seen many polls from the area that say the public is against it.
StLouisRams,30r21a,SoulardSTL,3,Mon Mar 30 13:55:36 2015 UTC,"Eh, kind of, but not really.   By and large, the efforts by the MO Senate recently were founded in partisan politics, more a desire for a new GOP Senator to make a name for himself by screwing with the Democrat Governor. There also are real issues with an Administrator being able to unilaterally extend debentures, but we're not here to talk civics.   I've heard word from the MO General Assembly (Legislature) on funding solutions progressing that'll sidestep this issue. Basically, we can anticipate proposals for funding being secured by means that differ from pure unilateral extensions of the EJD bonds. There is bipartisan support for retaining MO businesses in MO, especially when doing so can generate positive ROI.   Again, MO is being asked to put forth 2 new NFL stadiums with public funding within 25 years in the same market. We're willing, but not necessarily happy to do it."
StLouisRams,30r21a,Ihateunerds,5,Mon Mar 30 18:34:16 2015 UTC,"The hope is that this project convinces enough owners to block a Rams move.

StLouisRams,30r21a,SoulardSTL,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure that it would be enforceable, in that the NFL would not be able to order Kroenke to pay $200MM to move into the New Riverfront Stadium. Kroenke has said he'd go along with whatever the NFL rules regarding relocation, implying that he'd participate in a new stadium's funding, but that's implication only. Taking Kroenke at his word is dubious at best. After all, Kroenke pledged to keep the Rams in STL when he bought majority interest.  Technically, the NFL could rule that the Chargers and Raiders can go to LA, that the Rams stay in STL. In theory, Kroenke could then throw a fit, ignore the new Riverfront Stadium plans in protest, and he keeps the team in the EJD. Not likely in the least, but possible.  Edit: Say the NFL rules that the Rams will remain in STL, but that the NFL would relocate the Chargers and Raiders into Inglewood, which Kroenke would still develop... What if Kroenke then says to the NFL that that scenario can work if and only if the League itself pays the Rams' contribution to the new Riverfront Stadium? He could say that all his liquid capital's dedicated to building Inglewood, but really it could be him saying to Goodell, ""You want this deal, then you put up my costs for STL""? Note - Pure speculation."
StLouisRams,30r21a,DeniseDeNephew,5,Mon Mar 30 18:44:58 2015 UTC,"Technically, the NFL could rule that the Chargers and Raiders can go to LA   Into what stadium?   The belief here seems to be that Kroenke is the only one who can't decide where his business can reside, are you also saying that the NFL can tell Kroenke to let two other teams play in his 1.86 billion dollar stadium, and let those other two teams reap the benefit of the huge increase in franchise value that the move to HIS stadium would bring them?  The Carson stadium doesn't seem to be making any progress but San Diego seems to be succumbing to the threat of the Chargers leaving and is getting serious about building something new for Spanos.   Say the NFL rules that the Rams will remain in STL, but that the NFL would relocate the Chargers and Raiders into Inglewood, which Kroenke would still develop...    Again, why do people keep saying that the NFL can decide who plays in Kroenke's stadium?  Speculation is one thing but this doesn't seem grounded in reality.   What if Kroenke then says to the NFL that that scenario can work if and only if the League itself pays the Rams' contribution to the new Riverfront Stadium?   So Kroenke loses a billion dollars in the value of his franchise in exchange for the 250 million dollar share of his cost of the Riverfront stadium?     Oh well, maybe it's time to just let this play out and focus on the draft."
StLouisRams,30r21a,SoulardSTL,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:43:44 2015 UTC,"These thoughts of mine are all on what possibly could happen. The NFL could vote this fall to relocate a possible 3 teams: the Rams, the Chargers, and the Raiders. Perhaps they vote to allow the relocation of the Chargers and the Raiders. Perhaps the NFL could encourage the Chargers and Raiders to relocate to an Inglewood development instead of a Carson development, which the League may consider a superior project, and from which Kroenke's development team would recognize all revenues from facilities management (parking, retail, concessions, long-term leases, increased property valuation, non-NFL events, naming rights, etc.).   As you and I were talking about last week, it may be feasible that the NFL could allow teams to play in a facility that is owned by another franchise's owner in which his own team may not play. These are all possibilities. All of us here are still just trying to infer what will happen from what little news gets out."

It really scares me.   Let's say the stars DO align on the home front. Rural Missourians and Kansas City residents will oppose state used funds for a stadium. Legislators will follow suit. But let's say despite that, whatever needs to pass DOES pass for funding this project. Then let's say St. Louis county steps up and shows huge support in whatever ways they can, creating the ideal space for construction. And some private companies (I've heard Goldman Sachs being throw around) offer bonds and invest in the stadium as well. Let's say we offer to fund the whole God damn thing ourselves and hand it over to Kronke on silver fucking platter. Maybe even throw in a blowjob or two from Peacock.   Let's say the NFL also takes a shockingly strong stance against a move to L.A. despite the inevitable spike in market value that the Rams would see through moving. But let's just say they do, and technically bar Kronke from moving. Why they would want to move the Raiders and/or San Diego, who have weak relocation plans, is beyond me.   Let's just say ALL of this happens. What is really stopping Kronke from moving after all is said and done? I mean, he's going to at least double the franchise of the Rams. If he moves anyway, despite the NFL's protests, they certainly can't do much to punish him.   Even if everything hear at home and support from the NFL is 99.9% successful, I don't see an endgame."

He also said, he's heard about a lot of other financing plans that weren't mentioned in the last 24 hours, and that one of those - and in the lead of those - is private financing.  edit: David Hunn's qualifications"
StLouisRams,30r21a,SoulardSTL,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:24:18 2015 UTC,Sounds like spin doctoring. TBH the only private financing that has a chance to keep the Rams in St Louis is Kroenke private financing. As it is he's privately financing a stadium in LA.
StLouisRams,30r21a,bozo7337,3,Wed Apr 1 18:31:59 2015 UTC,"There are lots of investment companies that could make considerable profits from such a deal and have the ability to assemble large amounts of capital in quick order. STL alone is home to 4 national broker-dealers (second only to Manhattan) as well as multiple institutional consulting groups & specialized asset management firms, including private equity and real estate groups. Plus, the Stadium Commission has actively been working with Goldman Sachs for some time, plus a new consulting partnership with a KC-based municipal bond underwriting group. And if we're talking individuals who'd actively like to be a part of an NFL stadium development project, more specifically a development that would stick it to Kroenke in the process... Who has the free capital, the desire to enter a market that may not be his own, who has shown he wants to be part of a NFL stadium being built, and who has an active vendetta against Kroenke?"
StLouisRams,30r21a,SoulardSTL,4,Wed Apr 1 20:08:09 2015 UTC,"So the state feels it can't get tax/bond money funding so now you're making it sound as if private investment money is falling over themselves to fun a stadium in St Louis? They've supposedly been working on this stadium for two years and now as we're closing down to months away from Kroenke petitioning to move the team all the sudden all this private money is available to fund this stadium? The first time this stadium came up in St Louis I said it then and I'll say it until when/if the Rams move. St Louis screwed up big time, they shouldn't have come to Kroenke with a plan for a stadium the city would own. They should have come at him with proposals to offer him land to build his own stadium on it. He's in this for the business side of it not to make fans all warm and fuzzy with the impression that their owner cares about them. Renting a stadium is going to do nothing for the value of his investment. Adding ownership of the stadium the team plays in will increase his investment. If they wanted to keep the Rams in St Louis they went about it with the owner they were dealing with completely backwards."
StLouisRams,30r21a,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think they've avoided any non-Kroenke private real estate development monies this whole so they could present the new riverfront stadium concept to Kroenke and entice him to co-develop the entire site. The commission's objective had been to convince both Kroenke and the NFL that the site was viable as a stadium, but secondarily to position the site for ancillary development opportunities. Kroenke seeks revenues from all ancillary site development, from naming rights to parking, which he could get if he ran the STL development. I think the stadium commission had wanted to get him to run the proposed STL development, but with his full commitment to Inglewood now evident, I think they're now more amenable to considering non-Kroenke private sector partners.   Note: I'm not thinking private equity is jumping out of the walls to contribute to this. I'm only stating that there are private sector options that haven't been addressed before. Plus, noting that 3 of the other 4 current proposed NFL stadiums have massive ancillary real estate development components to them, it's only reasonable to think the STL commission could look to this as well.   And I think the State is actively pursuing public funding right now, just not necessarily by pure extension of the EJD muni bonds."

Pure speculation: Stan's old buddy Phil Anschutz, owner of Anschutz Entertainment Group. Phil & Stan were real good real estate billionaire buddies for years, hanging out in Denver and each other's Montana ranches all the time. Then Stan proposed Inglewood and sank AEG's giant Farmers Field project, burning Phil for $50MM+ while taking down a project five years in the making. Killed a friendship and made an enemy. Phil's already fired back with the Homeland Security and NTSB reports, just throwing jabs at Inglewood. I could see him go the whole ""Fuck me?

Killed a friendship and made an enemy   Alright, so I've been following this saga, mostly from the LA side of things, and you seem to have a few misconceptions about the Farmers Field plan. First of all, Kroenke didn't sink AEG's plans. Neither plan was dependent on the other one collapsing. AEG failed because their main stipulation in order to build it was a majority ownership share (acquired at a discount) in whichever team agreed to play there. Now, not only was this a challenge to begin with, but they also had to get this done within the timeline set by the City of Los Angeles. See, the land where Farmers Field was supposed to be built is the current West Hall of the Los Angeles Convention Center and is owned by the city. The city had already been planning to upgrade the LACC, especially the much older West Hall, when AEG approached them with the hybrid stadium/convention hall idea. The city gave AEG from 2010 until October of last year to find a team and if they failed the city would just go on ahead and upgrade the Convention Center without AEG's stadium. When Farmers field was announced there were five possible teams that were willing to relocate (Rams, Raiders, Chargers, Vikings, and Jaguars). By September of last year when AEG asked the city for a six month extension there were only three. When Kroenke announced his stadium plan, that left just the Chargers and Raiders as possible tenants. Unfortunately for Anschutz neither Spanos, nor Davis were willing to give up a majority ownership share. Farmers Field died the moment Spanos and Davis announced their joint Carson proposal. Anschutz simply ran out of teams and time.    Phil's already fired back with the Homeland Security and NTSB reports, just throwing jabs at Inglewood.    Neither agency has released any report on the Inglewood stadium. That report was authored by former employees acting as paid ""consultants"". AEG also attacked the Carson plan, so you can't really say he's declared war on Kroenke.    I could see him go the whole ""Fuck me? No, fuck YOU!"" route and throw capital into the STL efforts just to keep Stan from being able to move the Rams to LA.   Ok, so in this scenario Anschutz is so pissed at Kroenke that in order to fuck with him he essentially gifts him a brand new stadium? That just doesn't make any sense. The Inglewood stadium plan isn't dependent on the Rams moving there in order to get built. Kroenke can still make tons of money as a landlord. ""Worst"" case scenario Kroenke ends up with two brand new stadiums in two different markets at the cost of one. That Phil guy, what a pal!"
StLouisRams,30r21a,bozo7337,1 point,Thu Apr 2 12:45:37 2015 UTC,"By and large, we are in agreement. I surely don’t dispute that AEG wanted equity in whatever team would’ve played in Farmers Field. I’m aware of the scope of the entire project’s conception, including the LACC, and its proximity to the Staples Center. I also acknowledge that AEG didn’t contract out two federal agencies, and that the reports were prepared by their two former directors; I just wanted to be brief on identifying the two reports. (And yes, they did crap some on Carson, too.)   Meanwhile, I do contend that Anshultz partially blames Kroenke for the collapse of Farmers Field. Their friendship has just recently gone away, following years of closeness. Think about it, they were among the only ones who could relate to each other as rural Midwestern boys who’ve made themselves billionaires through commercial real estate development; their friendship was natural. They’ve also worked together on prior projects, from commercial real estate development around Denver to Kroenke buying the Colorado Rapids MLS franchise from Anshultz in 2003.   Prior to Inglewood being synonymous with stadium development, speculation of the Rams going back to LA centered on a reasonable joint venture between Kroenke and Anshultz. Here’s a Bleacher Report story on this dating to 2010, with an apparent leak from within AEG that a JV was likely. Phil must have kept Stan up to date for years on the intricacies of “Farmers Field”, including apparent conversations on the two of them working together. But, instead of a joint venture, Stan took what Phil’s company had been working on for years and worked to trump it, knowing full well that its size and scope would decimate his friend’s proposal, which it did. I’m not saying that AEG would have succeeded if not for Kroenke Sports Enterprises’ Inglewood proposal, but I think Phil Anshultz lays part of the blame at Stan Kroenke, his not-so-close-anymore friend. I can see real bitterness here.   As for “gifting” Kroenke a stadium in STL: I really don’t think the proposed STL stadium is what Kroenke would have wanted to build in STL. While I personally like the setup, it doesn’t fit Stan’s MO regarding what he’d want in a new stadium: “owning the dirt”; architecture by HBE, his favorite stadium design firm; direct revenues from retail, parking, concessions, naming rights, and all other events; and most of all location. For the past few years, I’ve anticipated another site in Downtown STL being where Kroenke would’ve built a new Rams stadium, based on his building patterns and stated wants in a site. The current proposals don’t match what he’s wanted, especially since it would be a majority civically-owned site, with secondary equity potentially held by private developers. Here potentially comes Phil. Not only does he derail Stan from taking the Rams to LA by offering to help STL’s financing efforts, but he positions himself as Kroenke’s potential landlord. That’s the personal. In this scenario, I could see Kroenke either look to keep the Rams in the EJD and bypass the new stadium, or look to own a new team, perhaps a California team, and with his eyes on the Denver Broncos, which he’s been pressing for some time.   Again, this is all just speculation that I think is reasonable."

It's really a poorly written article. It looks like he's shelving that option now but still going forward for funding of a new stadium but said if at a later date they get an approval from the NFL. But he doesn't think they'll need it because whatever NFL owner is in St Louis ""will be persuaded to put down more money for the stadium."""
StLouisRams,30r21a,eight26,4,Tue Mar 31 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"In the end, it appears that the state knows the county wants a vote, and the vote won't pass. So the state says, we don't need county money for this.  I have a feeling this was not without foresight from the State/Task force, I think it's just a matter of doing it to get it done.   I don't think so horrible for the financing plan that it spells death to the plan, because if that were the case, they would have a vote right? As a last resort?"
StLouisRams,30r21a,SoulardSTL,2,Wed Apr 1 17:23:02 2015 UTC,Read it multiple times. Still not clear whether this is good or bad for St Louis (city).
StLouisRams,30r21a,bozo7337,0,Tue Mar 31 21:56:28 2015 UTC,"This could signal that the STL financing plans are really advancing. Reasoning: The Governor's office telling a potential civic contributor that they're not necessary to participate in the future development's funding mechanisms, even though they assumed they had to be, may mean that new plans are advancing at the State level big enough that STL County doesn't even need to be a part of it. If so, then we're looking at something besides just extending the Edward Jones Dome bonds, into which STL City and County participate already and presumably would've been on the hook for going forward.   The MO General Assembly (Legislature) is said to have been considering alternative funding mechanisms besides the Governor's unilateral extension of the EJD bonds, promoting the stadium while sidestepping partisan politics.   Insidestl.com interviewed the above article's writer earlier today, and the idea came out that ""private investors"" may be part of what's going forward. This makes sense. Oakland's Coliseum City, San Diego's preliminary new Mission Hill stadium, and absolutely Inglewood are all focused on ancillary private real estate development furthering these projects' financing. So far, neither Carson nor STL's Riverfront Stadium have made any mention of ancillary business development. Perhaps this is a reasonable option to complement public funding for the STL project. Locally, STL has a great amount of private wealth that could support it. Then again, I can immediately think of a non-STL real estate investor who could want to get involved in this for personal reasons..."
StLouisRams,30r21a,eight26,0,Wed Apr 1 17:54:59 2015 UTC,It's a really horribly written article. The title of the article isn't fully discussed and isn't mentioned until about half way down. It sounds like he's addressing the moving of the bond. As the bond is written the state pays $12 million a year for it and the city and county of St Louis combine for another 6. It sounds like he's saying the County isn't responsible for it's portion of that $6 million. First off he has no authority to reword a bond that's already been issued. Secondly he goes on to say this makes their proposal stronger because the owner will just pay more money. Makes zero sense to me how they came to these conclusions or how Nixon thinks he can do that.
StLouisRams,30r21a,bozo7337,2,Tue Mar 31 22:05:10 2015 UTC,"At this moment, there are no actual concrete financing plans."
StLouisRams,30r21a,Magnemmike,2,Wed Apr 1 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"Looks like the St Louis plan, as it was getting more detailed is being unraveled by financing."

StLouisRams,30j5as,pattycraq,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:06:27 2015 UTC,Every team in the NFL needs someone at or above the Dalton line to have sustained success. Foles is arguably not that based off of his regression last year (really more just that he did not get away with as many mistakes) and his own injury proneness. You can't really get away with average QB play in the NFL anymore and expect to have a very good/great team. We can be decently competitive with average QB play obviously but teams aren't making nice playoff runs without more from the QB.
StLouisRams,30j5as,m_fromm,2,Sat Mar 28 08:22:46 2015 UTC,"his own injury proneness.   What ""injury proneness""? He broke his collar bone and had a concussion. That's it..."
StLouisRams,30j5as,Kaos047,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:28:18 2015 UTC,"He broke his hand in 2012 and missed the final game because of it. He had the concussion and a groin pull in 2013, and a broken collarbone this past year.  He's gotten hurt one way or another each year of his NFL career and missed games because of it. You can not have your QB miss games in this league period. It's not on Bradford levels but it is still there."
StLouisRams,30j5as,m_fromm,2,Sat Mar 28 17:04:33 2015 UTC,"I think you're overstating his regression. In the games he played in 2014, he had a makeshift line and ended getting sacked a lot more. He also had to throw considerably more pass attempts per game, which wouldnt be as big of a problem in the rams style offense. Injury concerns are valid, but the rams aren't going to give up on Foles before he plays a down as a Ram. If they were going to draft a QB early, they would've traded Bradford for picks"
StLouisRams,30j5as,mateoelgigante,1 point,Sat Mar 28 18:55:01 2015 UTC,I hope I am wrong when I say that his numbers weren't padded because of the system he was in. Hopefully we end up bringing in Scherff and another lineman from the draft that can step in and give him the time he needs. Any QB in this league can look pretty good with a good OL.
StLouisRams,30j5as,New_DudeToo,8,Sat Mar 28 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"We need those picks for OL though. Otherwise, Foles and Winston will just get murdered before we see what they can do."

StLouisRams,30hj5j,purpleparts,8,Fri Mar 27 12:59:16 2015 UTC,I instantly stopped reading when I saw DE as a need
StLouisRams,30hj5j,TheeVande,2,Fri Mar 27 17:37:17 2015 UTC,I can almost see St Louis becoming the New England of DE's. Just as New England picks up QB's to learn under Brady we can let young defensive ends train under a great defensive line and then trade them away for picks at some point.  Not a need though.
StLouisRams,30hj5j,BilllyMayes,2,Fri Mar 27 20:09:54 2015 UTC,"I could see it. Chris long was hurt most of last year, and honestly not very good when he did play. Hayes is on the last year of his deal. Sims is backup quality at best and penalty prone. Ethan Westbrooks has promise, but he was still a UDFA for a reason. Wouldn't take much for DE to turn into a weakness (outside of Quinn) rather than a strength."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,TheSmart1,9,Sat Mar 28 01:25:24 2015 UTC,I really don't see how QB is a strong need for us right now. Give Nick Foles a chance.
StLouisRams,30hj5j,One_Half_Hamster,6,Fri Mar 27 14:55:20 2015 UTC,I agree in the strong need department but he's on his contract year. If we don't sign him for some reason we're stuck without a QB.
StLouisRams,30hj5j,axle69,2,Fri Mar 27 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"This is true, do you know how the draft class or FA outlook at QB looks for next off-season?"
StLouisRams,30hj5j,One_Half_Hamster,3,Fri Mar 27 16:43:40 2015 UTC,"FA class is stocked with talent right now ; Eli Manning, Rivers, Newton, Luck, RG3, and Tannehill and more. Obviously, I wouldn't hold out hope that many or any of them actually hit the market."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,nufandan,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:07:56 2015 UTC,"I am 99.9% sure Rivers wont hit FA. If I remember reading right he is settled down in San Diego and really doesn't want to move. Luck and Manning are too pivotal to their respective franchises. Newton is likely staying in Carolina. Tannehill is quietly doing a lot of good for Miami, don't see him leaving. RG3 coming to STL would be hilarious but I honestly don't know if we pick him up if he doesn't work out in Washington. Of those on the list he is the most likely to leave."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,BilllyMayes,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:08:06 2015 UTC,Draft class looks deep next year but that can change quickly.
StLouisRams,30hj5j,axle69,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:22:12 2015 UTC,"None of those guys will hit FA, except maybe RGIII"
StLouisRams,30hj5j,QUINNtessentialTruth,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"We need OL before QB, but we still need to draft a contingency plan at QB."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,QUINNtessentialTruth,9,Fri Mar 27 20:46:29 2015 UTC,Personally I would love to see Schreff and Erving on our OL.
StLouisRams,30hj5j,genericman12,3,Fri Mar 27 16:01:12 2015 UTC,"Would we always use Scherff as an interior lineman? The fact that he doesn't get off the ball well against pass rush and only makes initial contact on second level blocks is a little scary for a Right tackle. Not as scary as if he was on the left side, but its a point to watch."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,BeefyMcFlaps,5,Fri Mar 27 16:13:31 2015 UTC,I think Schreff is best suited for the interior but we at least have to resign Barksdale to make that happen
StLouisRams,30hj5j,genericman12,2,Fri Mar 27 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"Speaking of, where the fuck is Barksdale? Surely he's done with the whole wedding thing by now. And besides, it's not like he even has to do anything. His agent will do 100% of the negotiating. All he has to do is sign."

Offensive line men (we are really lacking on QB protection, as you all know). 2. Cornerbacks (we let a lot of opposing offenses last year wiiiide open on the corners). 3. Running back or Tight Ends. 4. QBs."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,chemicalpoisons,5,Fri Mar 27 17:38:14 2015 UTC,",,,Running backs? I think we have a great combination in Mason-Cunningham-Stacy."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,SonicRainboom,3,Fri Mar 27 19:50:07 2015 UTC,uhh we don't need running backs
StLouisRams,30hj5j,sjphilsphan,2,Fri Mar 27 20:50:51 2015 UTC,Weeeellll I guess I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
StLouisRams,30hj5j,SonicRainboom,2,Thu Jun 25 09:04:09 2015 UTC,"I almost wouldn't mind throwing all of our picks on O-line. Get us a good CB, maybe a late round QB. We NEED a stronger O-line though."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,BilllyMayes,-2,Fri Mar 27 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"My top 5 needs, in order, are:   OL. As of now we need a G, C, and RT.  CB. Tru was bad last year, Jenkins was up and down but mostly down. EJ was very good, and Joyner is best suited for the slot or FS.  FS. Mcleod was perfectly average, which was a big improvement over what used to be there, but he could be upgraded ( and would serve as a great backup) so we don't have so many infuriating coverage breakdowns.  MLB. James Laurinaitis is playing on name recognition. He's a weak point on our front 7, and MLB is not where you want to have a weak point.  WR. Britt and Quick (if healthy) should be a layout of solid periphery WRs and Bailey played amazing in the slot last year, but it wouldn't hurt to add another guy. WR should be deep this year, almost as much as last, and I wouldn't oppose a guy like Jaelen Strong in the 2nd or Cooper/White if one of them falls to 10.    I consider TE a need, but just honestly don't feel they'll address it in the draft with how much money we have tired up on our TEs already, and a 3rd string TE can only add so  much. So there's my thoughts, I'm always down to discuss if anyone wants.   Edit: accidentally put LT instead of RT."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,TheSmart1,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:37:01 2015 UTC,"According to PFF Jenkins is one of the top CBs out there. He looks like he gets burned but its mostly missed coverage's by others. EJ is great, Tru is solid, and Joyner is back. CB is not a big need. Also I do believe we drafted Greg Robinson to play LT bud so it isn't a need. Also JL is not that weak, he is solid as far as MLBs go."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,avanhokie,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:07:53 2015 UTC,"I accidentally put LT, meant RT.   Janoris was 41st/70 overall on coverage grade for corners with 50% snaps. He's just not that good. Definitely not #1 CB material.  Tru was just bad last year. Not good, not average, just bad.   And JL is a weakness, he was ranked 45th out of 60 in overall grade for players who played 25% snaps. He's not a good or even average MLB."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,TheSmart1,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:27:14 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, I figured something must have been off to put LT. I know Janoris isn't a top CB but he is decent. All of our CBs are still young, Tru can bounce back hopefully, but that JL number is surprising. I think there will be good LBs on the board in rounds 3-4 so hopefully we can draft one."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,avanhokie,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:42:55 2015 UTC,"JL was good for the first few years, but he's just really gotten worse over the past 3 years. I want him to be good, but he had a -9.6 run D grade last year (29th out of 34 ILBs). He just gets swept away in run D too easily. It's hard for Rams fans to admit cuz he and Chris Long are two of the most favorite players on the team, but he really has lost a step.  It was no secret the Rams were interested in MLBs last year. I saw quite a few stories reporting how interested the Rams were in CJ Mosley, and there was also word they would've taken him if Aaron Donald was gone.   I do think and hope Tru can bounce back. He was injured and maybe that hurt his effectiveness last year, plus the year before he was pretty good."
StLouisRams,30hj5j,TheSmart1,2,Mon Mar 30 01:14:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think the injury was lingering for Trumaine, and I think he was even more desperate to return to form because EJ was cementing himself. I think there are a couple possible linebackers that would fit well but its all up to Snead/Fish.  I predict 1st: OL/WR 2nd: OL/WR 3rd: LB/CB/OL 4th: QB/CB/LB 2 6th's: QB/CB/OL 7th: Best player Plenty of possibilities this draft."

StLouisRams,30f8pb,sunderstormer,2,Wed Apr 15 20:48:45 2015 UTC,Dubnyk needs his rest though! How about we pass Chicago in the standings and sweep the Preds so we can meet you in the second round?
StLouisRams,30f8pb,cbaumber,5,Fri Mar 27 03:22:07 2015 UTC,Any scenario where the Blues don't have to play the Hawks in the first round is a win in my book!  Edit: Preds currently hold the Central one spot as of an hour ago.
StLouisRams,30f8pb,sunderstormer,3,Fri Mar 27 03:27:34 2015 UTC,Oh shit really? Then I don't want the Wild to pass Chicago. You guys are scary.
StLouisRams,30f8pb,wowbagger88,8,Fri Mar 27 03:32:43 2015 UTC,"I'd be shocked if the Rams go for a WR in the first. I'd like to see three rounds of offensive lineman, but I think it's safe bet that won't happen."

StLouisRams,30f8pb,callmeNY,1 point,Fri Mar 27 13:57:15 2015 UTC,"I know White got really hyped up after the combine, but personally Cooper seems like a once every 5 years type talent.  Kid dominated in college, and that's even an understatement...carried the most dominant program's offense for years, and is just so disciplined and such a talented route runner.  I hope we go OL, but I would be completely satisfied with Cooper, kid's a stud."
StLouisRams,30f8pb,the_rape_sloth,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:59:51 2015 UTC,Cooper didn't carry Bama's offense. Their RBs and OL did. Cooper drops way too many balls for my liking. That's just my opinion though.
StLouisRams,30f8pb,callmeNY,1 point,Fri Mar 27 07:41:25 2015 UTC,"Idk, he had 124 catches for over 1700 yds and 16 TDs last season...those are some monster numbers."

I was just saying he didn't carry their offense the last few years, just last year you could have an argument."
StLouisRams,30f8pb,houseofpayne55,4,Fri Mar 27 14:20:45 2015 UTC,"I like you, I just hope to god we can stay healthy at the most important position for once. And I also pray for defensive consistency."
StLouisRams,30f8pb,BrawndoTTM,7,Fri Mar 27 14:32:16 2015 UTC,"He's not THAT bad. He's not anywhere near starter quality, but as far as backups go he's decent."
StLouisRams,30f8pb,m0pi1,5,Thu Mar 26 23:21:24 2015 UTC,There is a reason he's a backup. He probably has more worth talking in the ear of a starting QB than he does going out on the field.
StLouisRams,30f8pb,BilllyMayes,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"He is a real strong backup, in my opinion one of the better in the league. You can't rely on him for a full season though."

StLouisRams,30f8pb,frankoftank,2,Fri Mar 27 05:52:12 2015 UTC,"God I hope for O line in the first round, maybe even the first 2 rounds. If Quick and Britt stay healthy, as well as Jared Cook, we've got 3 legit receiving options. If Studman Bailey and Tavon Austin improve in the magical 3rd year for WRs, then we're set.  Meanwhile, our o line is looking questionable at best. Our tackles are suspect on both sides of the line with Jake Long and Joe Barksdale still not re-signed. Greg Robinson is going to have to make huge strides in the off season to be considered a good tackle.  We've got Rodger Saffold to man one of the guard spots or a tackle spot, and that's it. 2 out of our 5 spots locked down. The other 3 are wide open with no clear starter in place."

StLouisRams,30fxiq,busman,5,Fri Mar 27 01:12:03 2015 UTC,Wouldn't touch Coates at all. His hands are horrible. Could probably grab Agholor with the same pick though. Agree though Peters doesn't drop that far.
StLouisRams,30fxiq,bozo7337,2,Fri Mar 27 04:07:57 2015 UTC,"He also falls under the ""only knows one route"" category. He's an electric player but he basically ran vertical routes every play."
StLouisRams,30fxiq,edubs_stl,2,Sat Mar 28 03:16:29 2015 UTC,Don't need a CB honestly and I'd rather not go after a project receiver when we have like 3 on the roster. If we could get him in the 3rd I'd be down for Hundley but unless that happens idk. I'd love to re-sign Barksdale and sign Wiz though then go guard in the draft.
StLouisRams,30fxiq,axle69,3,Fri Mar 27 07:40:39 2015 UTC,No way peters makes it past the late first round let alone falls to the third
StLouisRams,30fxiq,DabDastic,2,Fri Mar 27 01:13:13 2015 UTC,"Would love Collins in that range, hate the Hundley pick, would like to add a cover Safety somewhere in the late second-early third."

StLouisRams,30fxiq,Sinisterminister77,0,Mon Mar 30 15:59:51 2015 UTC,"Hundley is a very bad pick. No pocket awareness, not from a pro system, no real arm talent. Garrett Grayson on the other hand. I would love that pick, not that high in the 2nd though, he is potential and the attitude to boot. If we had to I would trade back into the 2nd to take him because I wouldn't trust him being there at the 72nd pick. Just a slight edit. Barrett Jones is ready to play either C or LG."
StLouisRams,30djem,QUINNtessentialTruth,8,Thu Mar 26 14:35:30 2015 UTC,Looks like an addition for more QC and analytics.  Always good to have someone for that these days.

StLouisRams,30c2p8,w0rldfam0us,21,Thu Mar 26 03:35:20 2015 UTC,so you would blame our coaching staff for him getting injured two years in a row?
StLouisRams,30c2p8,vrock627,7,Thu Mar 26 03:36:27 2015 UTC,"Right before he got injured he was actually looking pretty damn solid. And that was with Daryl Richardson as the RB for most of the time. He didn't have Britt yet, Quick wasn't even that good yet, Was still a fresh Rookie Tavon he was throwing too like cmon he had nothing... still had to put up a bunch of yards to make up for Richardsons slack but went 14 td 4 int.... This kid if healthy is going to kill it I already know it. I can't wait for him to play next season even tho he isn't on the rams."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,RamsWillFly,3,Thu Mar 26 19:57:33 2015 UTC,Who said that? It's like exactly how I feel. Sam carried a garbage offense to mediocrity when he was on the feld.
StLouisRams,30c2p8,kahyote484,-5,Fri Mar 27 02:57:17 2015 UTC,"No, blame the Front Office...who drafted a potential star QB to play without an O-line that could defend him (this was obvious) without a running back to take the load off of him (this was obvious) and without a recieving group for him to even throw the ball to (again, it could not have been any more predictable).  I blame the front office entirely for their decision making because it was not a football decision, it was all marketing and dollars.  Hats off to em' though...it worked...for a few months...Now look where we are..."

We had SJ39 as his RB for his first three years, who is in the top 5 all time RB's for the Rams. And that's saying something because the Rams have historically had very very good RB's."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,Kaos047,4,Thu Mar 26 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"You're right, only defending Super Bowl Champions should ever draft a QB"
StLouisRams,30c2p8,diesel321,3,Thu Mar 26 15:17:24 2015 UTC,you do know that we got a new QB and a 2nd round pick out of bradford right? its not like he just left for nothing...
StLouisRams,30c2p8,vrock627,0,Thu Mar 26 15:33:02 2015 UTC,And we spent the number 1 overall pick to get him...
StLouisRams,30c2p8,Salesman89,16,Thu Mar 26 16:49:10 2015 UTC,Then that probably means Bradford's ACL's didn't tear on him for the season. The guy has skill. That's something that can never be argued against. But. He couldn't stay healthy.
StLouisRams,30c2p8,JKaye57,3,Thu Mar 26 11:51:30 2015 UTC,That's something that can never be argued against.   you'd be surprised what comes up about him when he is brought up in /r/nfl

I'll give the same answer now I gave then; we made the smartest trade we could based upon what we know to be true.       Could Sam turn into a star in Philly? Sure. It's possible. But he could also be in street clothes by midseason.        Fisher, whom I do have deep reservations about, did everything he could for Sam. He paid top dollar for FA OLs like Long, Wells, and Saffold; he traded up to get him a WR, ponied up more FA money for a top-flight TE. Fisher's had some rotten luck trying to build this offense, and Sam has been a part of that."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,qp0n,5,Thu Mar 26 09:21:59 2015 UTC,"Every single Eagles fan is recklessly optimistic as hell that Bradford could finally turn the corner and reach his potential... but I don't think you'll find a single one of us that thinks we didn't give up too much to get him.   I remember the minutes after the news of the trade broke, everyone in Eagles-fan circles were under the impression there was a typo and one of the draft picks was reported for the wrong team. Certainly we couldn't have just given up a young, proven 2nd-tier QB still cheap as fuck on his rookie contract for the most enigmatic training-room QB in the NFL under a $13 million contract and GIVE those draft picks. No no no, surely someone misspoke, surely we are receiving those picks, right? .... RIGHT?  Despite all the insanity encompassed by Chip's offseason moves, the only one I cannot defend is the compensation of this trade."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,BilllyMayes,3,Fri Mar 27 18:05:55 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I think a lot of Rams fans thought it was a typo too.  I'm a little confused on what Chip is doing, but hold faith. That contract is up at the end of this season (I think?) and they can cut him if need be. This year might be one of those change of pace years for ya'll, looking to the future. We've been dealing with those change of pace years for a decade+ now."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,ClarkGRISWOLD13,9,Fri Mar 27 20:20:48 2015 UTC,The coaching staff can't control Sam Bradford's 2 torn ACL's..judge them based on what happens this year. They have the talent and what appears to be a capable QB in Nick Foles. If Fisher fails again this year I am in favor of reevaluating the head coaching position.

As for Fisher my opinion of him hasn't changed from year 1. He is a decently above average head coach that hires god awful coordinators. Just wish he would get rid of Greg Williams.

His play-action passes in his rookie season were so much fun to watch, and he showed a lot of promise. It's a shame that rubbish OCs and injuries seem to have wasted some of that promise."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,CrackMamba,3,Tue Mar 31 04:38:08 2015 UTC,"Then good for Sam and Chip. This move had to happen, imo"
StLouisRams,30c2p8,coldam,2,Thu Mar 26 13:51:09 2015 UTC,"Sam came out of Oklahoma as one of the best QB prospects of all time. The only concern was that shoulder injury. He showed up that rookie season and gave us all a taste of what he could become. However, I don't think he was every truly set up to be an ""Elite"" QB with the systems he operated and the talent that was placed around him. In junction with that, he could not stay on the field. If you look at Coach Kelly's system and history with QBs; I think that Bradford has an EXCELLENT chance of excelling with the Eagles. I'd almost guarantee it. I still wish him all the best."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,PRE_-CISION-_,2,Fri Mar 27 20:42:42 2015 UTC,"We'll all be happy to see Sam succeed again.  I'm expecting Foles to not be far behind, though."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,kersey79,2,Thu Mar 26 13:34:38 2015 UTC,I hope he does. I hope the Rams and Eagles meet in the NFC Championship Game.
StLouisRams,30c2p8,Thracion,2,Thu Mar 26 14:49:51 2015 UTC,Good for Sam if so. He had his chance with us and well it just didn't work. For the betterment of our team we needed to move on in my opinion. I'll root for Bradford to have a good career until we play them in the playoffs.
StLouisRams,30c2p8,Samu-ELBradford,2,Thu Mar 26 22:51:15 2015 UTC,What if I get hit by a bus tomorrow?
StLouisRams,30c2p8,Thracion,2,Thu Mar 26 12:10:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if Bradford has a lot of success this year, I'm more likely to attribute it to Chip's system than to Bradford being a great player."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,DavidFuckingDuchovny,3,Thu Mar 26 07:30:06 2015 UTC,But you won't attribute this to nick foles success.  If nick foles is a product of chip kelly the rams won't improve this year
StLouisRams,30c2p8,Thracion,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"I will wait and see how Foles does for us this year before I label him as great, because I do think Foles benefited heavily from Chip's system.  Until he actually plays for us, we won't know how good he is outside of it.  However, I think he is much healthier than Bradford, so I would still consider him an upgrade."

I am curious this got me thinking, how would troy aikman fair in the patriots offense of today?   or Tony Banks with the greatest show on turf?   what would someone like Steve Young do with the rams offense of last year?   I personally think we got excellent value for Sam Bradford. It was no secret if you attended games last year Bradford throws a weak deep ball. He will be 30 in a few years. Can Chip Kelly teach him how to be an elite QB?   Sam Bradford almost cost Jeff Fisher his job in St. Louis, and I believe we all know how high the stakes are going to be in Philadelphia when Bradford goes down with a high ankle sprain, or a shoulder stinger, or a ""lower leg injury"" in week 7."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:09:07 2015 UTC,"Right before he got injured he was actually looking pretty damn solid. And that was with Daryl fuckin Richardson as the RB for most of the time. He didn't have Britt yet, Quick wasn't even that good yet, Was still a fresh Rookie Tavon he was throwing too like cmon he had nothing... still had to put up a bunch of yards to make up for Richardsons slack but went 14 td 4 int.... This kid if healthy is going to kill it I already know it. I can't wait for him to play next season."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,CommanderJ7,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"Its a good trade for the Rams no matter what. The Rams don't need someone like Bradford anymore. They want to run the ball first and have decent, consistent, QB play. With Bradford the Rams had the potential for great QB play but his salary and injury history made him a liability for the Rams.  If he has a break out year with the Eagles then good for him. The Rams need a good QB who is a more durable then Bradford. Foles seems to fit that pretty damn well.   On top of that a 2nd round pick is pretty good value for swapping two good QBs. IMO Foles' resume is better then Bradford. Bradford has better upside, but he is older and has much more of an injury history."
StLouisRams,30c2p8,corbilm,0,Fri Mar 27 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not the biggest fan of Jeff Fisher, but he did everything he could. He doesn't control the injury fairy, and that was always Sam's biggest problem. His production on the field wasn't stellar, but it was more than adequate to be a starter. If Sam doesn't get injured again, he'll have success in Philly, but it was the right move to get rid of him. A khal who can't ride is no khal, and a QB who can't reliably stay healthy isn't a franchise QB."

We are so set at DE it's not even funny. More so than we were at DT last season. We have Quinn, Long, Bill Hayes, Sims, Westbrooks. Even if he were the BPA at that slot in the draft, we should trade back and give him to someone else."
StLouisRams,30e5k9,CplPJ,5,Thu Mar 26 17:43:53 2015 UTC,"Mayyyyyybe if we can get him in the 2nd. Honestly, even as a Nebraska fan I think Gregory is overrated for anybody trying to fit him into a 4-3 scheme, and we of all people are set at D Line. I will be mildly surprised if he turns out even as well as Hayes, who could function as a starter DE easily, and that means he's certainly not worth taking to replace our #3 DE.  And I'd be extremely skeptical about putting him at OLB in a 4-3 as well."
StLouisRams,30e5k9,ITameFatGirls,5,Thu Mar 26 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"The whole Justin Blackmon and Josh Gordon incidents scare me.

Still think he's over-rated, shouldn't go in the top 10 prior to the drug test IMO.  Donald was a different case, he was a legit Top 5 selection, if he measured 2-3 inches taller no chance in hell he'd make it past 5.  The whole shortness thing with scouts."

StLouisRams,30a59r,butter_my_fingers,3,Wed Mar 25 22:06:58 2015 UTC,None of those guys are QB's when we drafted Sam who was our QB?
StLouisRams,30a59r,NewBroPewPew,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:50:00 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter. Many agree that what has damned us over the past decade is our tendency to draft for positional need. The entire league is going in the direction of selecting the best player available which has worked out for many teams and really worked out for us last year when we selected a defensive tackle who ended up being DROY even though defensive tackle wasn't a position of need
StLouisRams,30a59r,ItsBiggy,2,Thu Mar 26 20:23:27 2015 UTC,Yeh but QB might be a position you don't do that for. You can't win with a bad QB but you can win with other bad positions. We had a beat up Bulger who had a rating of 70 and Kyle Boller. Suh and McCoy would have been awesome or any other big name from that draft but we still would have had Kyle Boller the next season or Keith Null.
StLouisRams,30a59r,NewBroPewPew,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with your reasoning, although QB is the one position I don't think you should do that for."

Talent wise for being a number 1 pick he's on the verge of being a bust just because he was the TOP pick, playing time wise he's a major bust. Still love him though"

StLouisRams,30a59r,DabDastic,-7,Mon Mar 30 18:48:00 2015 UTC,I just don't think injuries should translate into being considered a bust. Would you consider Oscar Taveras a bust since he was regarded as a top prospect for a few years and then died suddenly?
StLouisRams,30a59r,IllyGilly,3,Wed Mar 25 22:28:31 2015 UTC,"No. Because he died? That's no even comparable there wasn't a scouting report that said Oscar could die at a young age, there was scouting reports the Bradford was injury prone. A more comparable player is Greg Oden who because he was always injured was a bust. Regardless Bradford never really played at an elite level just above the Dalton line he's not going to be in the top tier of Quarterbacks and I feel a QB picked forced overall wether the team reaches or not unless he's at an elite level, will always have a semi bust label. Like I said before if bradford was picked later in the draft he prolly wouldn't be consider the bust he is, but when you are drafted #1 overall expiation are high."
StLouisRams,30a59r,DabDastic,-1,Wed Mar 25 23:18:47 2015 UTC,If he was known to be injury prone before hand then that would make him less of a bust so that's irrelevant. Top quarterbacks usually take 3-4 years to even become elite unless you are a freak like Luck. Bradford was cut short and considered a bust because of injuries. So I guess it just depends on people's definition of bust. Would Derrick Rose be considered a bust then?
StLouisRams,30a59r,IllyGilly,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:22:41 2015 UTC,"I think to an extent Rose could be considered a bust, but that's tricky because when he is healthy he has shown to be elite unlike Oden and Bradford"
StLouisRams,30a59r,DabDastic,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"Bust = failure to live up to potential.   Taveras had, at least, the potential to be a major league starter for 5 years. That's not going to happen, so he is a bust.  Bradford had, at least, the potential to be a franchise quarterback. He wasn't that for the Rams, so he is a bust, too."

StLouisRams,30a59r,AsaKurai,2,Thu Mar 26 03:16:08 2015 UTC,"At this point he probably is but he still has time to salvage his career.  I wonder how much his crazy pre-rookie cap salary has to do with our opinion of Sam?   Rookie salaries were out of control, especially for QBs.  If the rookie salary cap hadn't been added what would Manziel's salary be?  Or better yet Blake Bortles, drafted at #3 overall and who has an 11-17 TD-INT ratio?  Bortles' salary would probably be significantly higher than Sam's and that would make Bortles' performance seem worse and probably make Sam seem like less of a bust.    It's still hard to believe that the Sam Bradford era in Rams history is over.   So many glimpses at what could have been, and so much frustration."
StLouisRams,30a59r,mastershake5987,4,Fri Mar 27 08:18:04 2015 UTC,"For what he was paid I would have to say so, but I think from here on out, he could post up great numbers and could be considered great in the grand scheme of things so it's still early IMO to label him as anything other than very unlucky...and rich."
StLouisRams,30a59r,PRE_-CISION-_,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:30:53 2015 UTC,I don't think you can call him a bust yet. If he was a bust as of right now he would hold almost 0 value in the NFL. The fact that he just got traded for a starting QB and some premium picks means he still has a high value in the NFL.
StLouisRams,30a59r,DavidFuckingDuchovny,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:32:41 2015 UTC,In his Rams era he was a bust. I would argue his rookie season is the only saving grace from making it a near unanimous opinion.
StLouisRams,30a59r,OldOrder,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:52:55 2015 UTC,"He definitely hasn't lived up to the hype, but does that mean he's a bust necessarily? I don't think so.   I mean I guess it depends. If he had gone 3rd round instead of first overall would he still be considered a bust?"
StLouisRams,30a59r,Chuy_3,1 point,Fri Mar 27 13:11:28 2015 UTC,"I personally don't label guys as busts if they are injured. A bust in my opinion is somebody that plays well below the level that were expected to play at. Sam improved every year he was on the field he just couldn't stay on the field long enough. Bradford isn't a bust, he is just a victim of unfortunate circumstance. If you want a Rams draft bust you look at people like Jason Smith, Alex Barron, Ty Hill."

StLouisRams,30a59r,Salesman89,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:47:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can permanently call Bradford a bust. I personally believe Bradford is still a good/great QB (I still liked the trade though) and I predict he will do great things in philly. If people want to temporarily call him a bust because he hasn't done much for us, fine.   Bradford has been dead weight while he was with us. But he has a chance to turn things around in Philly. If Bradford bombs with the Eagles I think it is fair to call him a bust, but until then I still believe he is a good/great quarterback."
StLouisRams,30a59r,DiscoJer,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:30:42 2015 UTC,"Yes.  We could have taken any other player at any position except QB and the team's salary cap would not have been effected much.  We could have made the overall team better while losing in 09', especially on offense.  Then we could have found a better fit at QB through FA or drafting one of the several QBs (INCLUDING NICK FOLES)  that came after bradford, and it would have been far cheaper.  Drafting Sam Bradford took us one immediate step forward...and 2 steps back over the next 4 years.  My fellow Rams fan friends said I was insane when I would argue against drafting Bradford before we did it.  But here we all are...with the same number of playoff games won as we would have had without him."

StLouisRams,30324l,QUINNtessentialTruth,22,Tue Mar 24 02:14:45 2015 UTC,You know which Patriots Quarterback was selected in the sixth round?  Garrett Gilbert
StLouisRams,30324l,bwc_28,4,Thu Mar 26 18:42:45 2015 UTC,This is due to us losing the following players last year due to FA:   Kellen Clemens Shelley Smith Darian Stewart Chris Williams
StLouisRams,30324l,PRE_-CISION-_,7,Tue Mar 24 02:43:04 2015 UTC,I'll take a sixth just to get rid of Clemens.
StLouisRams,30324l,Maverick814,2,Tue Mar 24 01:48:50 2015 UTC,I'll take nothing to get rid of Clemens.
StLouisRams,30324l,Cloud324,3,Tue Mar 24 03:42:14 2015 UTC,Awesome! We better not spend it all in one place.
StLouisRams,30324l,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,3,Thu Mar 26 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"We get a 6th rounder, to replace the one we traded.  Soooo....we traded a 4th rounder for Mark Barron, who immediately became a starter for us and has potential to be a true difference maker for the team for years to come.  Not a bad deal, if you ask me."
StLouisRams,30324l,BilllyMayes,3,Tue Mar 24 01:58:07 2015 UTC,Traded a 4th and 6th for Barron. Got a comp 6th pick and traded bradford for a 4th. We lost a 5th rounder for Barron.
StLouisRams,30324l,QUINNtessentialTruth,2,Tue Mar 24 21:34:47 2015 UTC,Can someone ELI5 compensatory picks? Is it basically if a player signs with another team on free agency the original team gets picks based on salary/performance? Does this include trades (I assume not).
StLouisRams,30324l,QUINNtessentialTruth,1 point,Wed Mar 25 01:10:33 2015 UTC,"Its based on how many FAs you lose and how many you gain (and also their caliber).  Once they weigh those out, NFL awards you comp picks based on a formula they use."
StLouisRams,30324l,QUINNtessentialTruth,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"No, because it wasn't a FA situation.  It was voided option so it does not go towards Comp pick.  I might need a second confirmation on this though."
StLouisRams,300gcz,SoulardSTL,17,Mon Mar 23 14:06:09 2015 UTC,"Consensus of Monday's relocation stories from Phoenix: Of the 3 teams considering LA, the Rams are simultaneously the most prepared and least worthy to relocate.   While the Inglewood development is hands-down a sound project, STL has responded most strongly to the Rams' needs for a new stadium, with specificity, while neither San Diego nor Oakland can show financing or rendering options. Both San Diego and Oakland can be said to have fallen short as markets, but STL remains a vocal, loyal, and definitely viable market for the Rams and the NFL.   Despite this, Kroenke is more prepared than either Spanos or Davis to move. And the only reason Kroenke wants to move is for more money.  And this is why this is all so tragic for STL."
StLouisRams,300gcz,Seductive_Santa,10,Mon Mar 23 20:17:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, being from Southern California I want Kronke's to get built whether it's the Rams playing there or not. The renderings are fucking spectacular and the Carson site pales in comparison. It would be revolutionary for LA sports.  Realistically, I have trouble seeing how the league rejects a plan that could be one of the crown jewel facilities. I feel for St. Louis fans, and would honestly take any team here including expansion, but from following the situation that's the vibe I get."
StLouisRams,300gcz,SoulardSTL,4,Tue Mar 24 03:31:08 2015 UTC,"Expansion of 2 teams into LA would have been the smart move. They really should have moved towards 36 teams, 3 divisions per conference, putting 2 in LA, 1 in Toronto, and 1 in maybe San Antonio. Franchise fees of $1BB+ per LA expansion team. Sure would have been easier to swallow than the bum-rush that's going on today. The League really let this whole thing slip out of control...   I also agree that the Inglewood plans are stunning, while maintaining that the Rams are the least worthy team to relocate there.   Would it be at all feasible that the Chargers and Raiders could play there instead of Carson, with the Rams staying in STL? I'm personally doubtful, noting cross-ownership issues and the flow of revenues. Still, I wonder... Say neither the Chargers nor the Raiders can get deals done in their home markets and continue with Carson plans. Could the League direct them to Inglewood instead, with Kroenke still in as developer? As franchise businesses, could this be a viable option? I'm not asking whether or not it could be likely, but viable for the teams to do so from a business perspective."
StLouisRams,300gcz,Seductive_Santa,4,Tue Mar 24 17:13:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm just speaking as a Californian on my preference for which stadium gets built. I'm ecstatic that the league is coming back in some capacity, since I want to root for the LA team, but Kronke's plan just looks so cool.  Stan wants his team to play in his stadium, and he's not building this without that in mind. However, if he somehow finds a way to sell the Rams and buy another team that wears silver and black, I wouldn't be completely surprised. He's determined to get this done and I maintain that's a possibility, even if it's not likely at this point.  The part of this that's interesting is that 1) we haven't seen the final product to be offered in SD and OAK and 2) How the legislative battle over funding the riverfront stadium will end. Once those two questions get answered, we should have a much more clear picture.  Keep in mind I would love the Rams back due to the history behind the team, but give me anything with ""Los Angeles"" in front of it and I'll love it forever."
StLouisRams,300gcz,SoulardSTL,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:30:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we haven't seen anything close to final product from either Sandy Eggo or Oakland. It looks like Oakland's closer to getting a project done, the Coliseum City uber-development. But, the A's and Warriors are avoiding any discussions, and plans are still a long ways off from being realistic. Meanwhile, the Chargers and SD City Hall are publicly bickering; I'm not confident that they'll get as far as having renderings done before the Chargers just yell ""fuck this"" and dedicate to Carson, whether or not Oakland joins in.   Of all 3 teams considering relocation, I think the Chargers are the most worthy by an order of magnitude (and I really like SD). The League really wants all the California problems to be solved internally, too. Same time, the NFL really wants a new stadium in STL, and the leverage is absolutely extended here. Will the League get everything they want?  And absolutely, you should have 2 teams with ""Los Angeles"" in the name, right now, but the NFL should have kept themselves in check and had those be expansion teams."
StLouisRams,300gcz,Seductive_Santa,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:54:08 2015 UTC,"The Raiders and Chargers coming back make perfect sense, but the reason everyone thinks it will be the Rams is the interesting part of it. Everyone around the league thinks Stan will be the guy to run this thing to the end, so maybe there are backroom politics and other factors that regular joes like us don't understand.  I think part of the solution is that some people forget on is that the site in LA matters. The league can't screw up LA again and they can't just have a run of the mill stadium, they need something spectacular to invigorate the market. Unfortunately for St. Louisans like yourself, Kroenke seems to have the edge in that regard.   And thanks for not shitting on us Californians, both our cities deserve football. I always figured there would be a team called the Hollywood Knights someday lol.  And on your note, Alameda County just approved Coliseum City, which means the Raiders can finally negotiate with the financing group."
StLouisRams,300gcz,SoulardSTL,3,Tue Mar 24 23:01:41 2015 UTC,"I've tried to follow everything in Oakland for a while, and the Coliseum City proposal sure is interesting. I wonder how feasible it is if the GS Warriors are headed to San Fran already. Meanwhile, the A’s aren’t talking to anyone apparently; they may have their eyes still focused on San Jose when their lease ends. Last night, I talked with a friend from Northern California, a lifelong Raiders fan, who told me he’s both supportive of the project and thinks there’s no way the politics can work out there.   Site does matter. Kroenke’s Inglewood plans hit many solid points (except they’re already fighting with the unions and involve the least-deserving team to play there). Aesthetically, I like the Inglewood stadium design over Carson’s, although the site has no room whatsoever for tailgating, a major flaw. Not everyone going to the games would want to pregame in a new urbanist neighborhood.   And of course, you’re welcome for us Saint Louisans not shitting all over you Californians. You guys deserve two teams, and we deserve to keep our one. Civil discourse is not dead, at least on our end. That said, this thread series is rough as fuck, and it sure would be nice to get some reciprocity here."
StLouisRams,300gcz,DeniseDeNephew,-5,Wed Mar 25 17:25:08 2015 UTC,"Civil discourse is not dead, at least on our end.    Not sure if you're joking, being passive-aggressive, or if this is just ironic but that sentence hardly represents ""civil discourse"" when it's got an insult in it."
StLouisRams,300gcz,SoulardSTL,2,Thu Mar 26 00:19:04 2015 UTC,"No passive-aggressiveness intended, no irony intended, no joking intended, no insult intended. Seriously, don't try to think too much into this stuff. I'm doing my best to not be insulting, personally or otherwise, and I hope for the same in turn. That hasn't always happened on this thread, and that fucking sucks. Any casual observer of this thread can see that there are cutting barbs between STL fans and LA fans, and it's getting fucking old. /u/Seductive_Santa and I were talking in a civil manner, with mutual respect, and you're seeking out passive-aggressive subterfuge in this? Come on..."
StLouisRams,300gcz,Seductive_Santa,2,Thu Mar 26 18:42:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I don't necessarily agree with everything you're saying and most likely vice versa, but we obviously showed we can have civil discussion regardless of geography. It's honestly nice to hear the perspective from the ""other side"", for lack of a better term."

StLouisRams,300gcz,downtown41,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:17:33 2015 UTC,I read it as civil discourse between SoulardSTL and Seductive_Santa. But didn't jump to a conclusion either way.

You may be right but the next sentence, asking for reciprocity, seems to indicate that he's talking about more than just one person.  But no matter, I keep coming to this thread looking for news and not just more spin."
StLouisRams,300gcz,sweetpooptatos,-8,Thu Mar 26 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but this is completely wrong. St. Louis had so many opportunities for years to get everything done and did nothing while simultaneously being near the bottom of the NFL in attendance. The terms of the contracts have been the same since it was written and they KNEW Kroenke would be able to do this if they didn't get their shit together, and they didn't. He is a business man first and foremost, just look what he is doing with Arsenal. He grew tired of having to deal with a terrible market that St Louis fans are just now starting to claim is great because, oh shit, they might lose the team. You guys had plenty of time and dragged your feet so now you're probably gonna lose the team. Don't blame him for trying to promote a sound business model. Blame the people of the city that did nothing to stop it until it was too late."
StLouisRams,300gcz,SoulardSTL,8,Mon Mar 23 22:17:03 2015 UTC,"Negotiations for renovating the Edward Jones Dome failed because Kroenke would not sign a long-term lease to the renovated dome. Even if STL paid $750MM out of pocket to secure the EJD according to his exact specifications, he still would have been free to relocate the team after 2025. I agree that these negotiations and the resulting arbitration are all based on the 1995 agreement, a legally, mutual agreement, which was a shitty deal that STL wrote by giving away everything with audacious standards against us. And it was within this deal that Kroenke would not budge to commit to STL after 2025 anyways. That's why the New Riverfront Stadium is being presented with a 40 year lease.   The New Riverfront Stadium proposal is the result of about a year’s worth of work by Peacock, who has been heading up the efforts to build a new stadium for much longer than he is credited for. November was just when Governor Nixon made his efforts public by naming him to this committee. What was shown off in February, the original Riverfront Stadium schematics, are part of a process that took much longer than a month to create, including land assemblage and meetings with funding agencies & partners. And, Kroenke announced his Inglewood plans when he did in part to stay a step ahead of the New Riverfront Stadium plans, not just to stay ahead of San Diego making plans. Absolutely: The New Riverfront Stadium was not STL throwing an idea together at the zero hour after Kroenke announces plans for Inglewood.   Remember that Stan Kroenke isn’t the sole owner of the Rams just yet. While he bought the majority interest from the Rosenbloom family in 2010, a remainder is still held out by Chip Rosenbloom, an LA-based film maker who serves as Rams Vice-Chairman. The 2010 acquisition of the 60% he didn’t own included the retained rights of Rosenbloom (and his sister, Lucia Rodriguez) to 30% of the team that Kroenke will buy at a later date. Both Chip & Lucia live in LA. Their desire for the Rams to play in LA is just as valid as his desire to make money.   The Rams haven’t had a winning season since 2003. This includes a 5-year run at 15-65, the worst losing record in NFL history. Being less than par for attendance while living through this hell is understandable. And in this time, Kroenke put NO money into the stadium. That STL still attended their games during this time is amazing.   When Kroenke bought the Rams, he pledged to keep them in STL. ""Just as I did everything that I could to bring the team to St. Louis in 1995. I believe my actions speak for themselves… There's a track record… I've always stepped up for pro football in St. Louis. And I'm stepping up one more time… I'm born and raised in Missouri. I've been a Missourian for 60 years. People in our state know me. People know I can be trusted. People know I am an honorable guy."" - Stan Kroenke But hey, fuck us for trusting him, right?"

If they do, we have a responsibility to make sure there’s a team in that market.”  and absolutely  “From my point of view, if they come up with a plan that looks pretty good and a strong financial package, I think we — the NFL — have an obligation in my opinion to be able to have a team in St. Louis."""
StLouisRams,300gcz,TheDuke13,3,Tue Mar 24 17:25:54 2015 UTC,NFL has an obligation to stay in STL is what Kraft said. He didn't say Rams at all. Just let that soak in.
StLouisRams,300gcz,bozo7337,3,Wed Mar 25 05:36:37 2015 UTC,They have to get financing solidified before anything could be considered.

Also this:   Currently, the next window for the Rams — and for that matter, the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers — to file for relocation is Jan. 1 through Feb. 15 of 2016. The league is considering moving up that window to the fall of 2015.   Next round of league meetings are May 18-20 in San Francisco, so we I expect there to be some more action around that time."
StLouisRams,300gcz,SoulardSTL,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:57:26 2015 UTC,"The league is considering moving up that window to the fall of 2015.   This is what makes the most sense.  Let's say that the Raiders and Chargers want to move to Kroenke's new stadium, what would be the best possible time to let the public know?  You don't want to tell the fans that the team is leaving before the season begins or it will hurt your ticket sales and no owner wants that.  And if you tell the fans in January or February, most likely after the season is over, then you eliminate any chance at a 'farewell' to the fans.  The best time to announce a move would be around Thanksgiving or maybe a little later.  You want there to be at least 1 home game left so the players can give a farewell to the fans with the least impact on ticket sales.  And that leaves the entire offseason for the players to relocate.  So that's when I expect to hear that either the Raiders or Chargers, or both, are relocating."
StLouisRams,300gcz,DeniseDeNephew,4,Thu Mar 26 16:36:35 2015 UTC,Ya Chargers or Raiders...right.
StLouisRams,300gcz,SoulardSTL,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:35:52 2015 UTC,"Makes sense giving the fans a chance to say goodbye in whatever markets may or may not be losing their team. I think it also has much to do towards getting the home efforts being more proactive.   In STL/MO, this will get the funding sources nailed down. From what I've heard, MO House Reps are generally in favor of the New Riverfront Stadium, don't want partisan politics arising here, and that funding options besides just extending the existing EJD bonds exist & are being pursued. And if these new options get derailed in Jeff City, then whoever trashed them will see their political party lose State offices for at least a decade. Stay tuned...   In Sandy Eggo, this will potentially get both the Chargers and City Hall actually working together to get something real done, and not just sniping at each other across social media. Right now, it's just blame-laying politics and shaming of people that should be negotiating together. If they're capable, maybe they'll even have renderings of a new  non-Downtown stadium sometime this summer...   In Oakland, this will compel the City and Alameda County to really work together to forward the Coliseum City project, maybe be able to negotiate with the team, and maybe, maybe, have a conversation with the A's, whose participation is critical and who have shown no interests whatsoever in Coliseum City. Ditto the Golden State Warriors...   /u/DeniseDeNephew: You think the NFL would get the Chargers and Raiders into Inglewood instead of Carson? I'd like to think so, but cross-ownership would be a mess. Or, since he's burned all his bridges in STL & MO, maybe... Maybe Kroenke moves to sell the Rams if they're gonna stay in STL, then builds Inglewood and gets to be landlord to the Chargers and Raiders. Maybe even getting a minority ownership stake in one of them while lording over both as real estate developer. All that's needed is for STL/MO to secure funding. -- Just a thought."
StLouisRams,300gcz,JackLife,-1,Thu Mar 26 21:34:55 2015 UTC,"You think the NFL would get the Chargers and Raiders into Inglewood instead of Carson?   If those are the only two choices them yes, because I think the Carson project is already dead and was probably never a serious proposal to begin with.  I could be wrong but it doesn't feel like any real progress is taking place.  The last I heard there was a petition-signing drive taking place in Carson which seems more like a small, dedicated band of fans working very hard but doing nothing of any real consequence.  But I haven't followed the Carson project very closely and I could have missed something significant.     Or, since he's burned all his bridges in STL & MO   This brings up what I think is an interesting point which I don't think has ever been discussed here.  What if the voters of St. Louis have a huge change of heart and suddenly a majority support the Riverfront stadium, and the NFL blocks Kroenke from moving.  The fans of St. Louis get what they want but the owner of the team loses as much as a billion dollars in the value of his team as a result.  There's been discussion of Kroenke's support (or lack thereof) for his other teams, how supportive would he be to a fanbase that took a cool billion out of his pocket?  Some might think that it would compel him to sell but why would he do that?  NFL teams are incredibly valuable, always increase in value over time regardless of any other factors, they go up in value rapidly (Forbes:  ""The average NFL team is worth $1.43 billion, up 23% from 2013""), and there are only 32 of then in the world.  Why the hell would he sell?  Anger?  Spite?  Revenge?  None of those make any sense and it certainly wouldn't be good business so I don't see it happening.  Then again, he probably wouldn't begin to give less support to the team because that isn't good business either.  But maybe another try at moving, and another, and another, until he succeeds and recoups the lost value of his team?  It's not what you want to hear but it seems like the most logical strategy for him to take.    Maybe Kroenke moves to sell the Rams if they're gonna stay in STL, then builds Inglewood and gets to be landlord to the Chargers and Raiders. Maybe even getting a minority ownership stake in one of them while lording over both as real estate developer. All that's needed is for STL/MO to secure funding.   I don't follow your logic here.  If STL/MO secures funding those other things happen why?"
StLouisRams,300gcz,D33GS,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"Carson/Inglewood: I think both are viable options if we’re talking about a potential home for the Chargers & Raiders. Aesthetically, I prefer Inglewood. The issues come with funding (Inglewood is Kroenke-funded, Carson is backed by the Chargers, Raiders, and Goldman Sachs) and the issues of having one franchise owner being landlord to two other franchises. From what I've read, Carson remains viable as an alternative development option, and they just secured the votes to bypass the public vote. At Carson's next city meeting, this'll put the Carson stadium option much closer being as shovel-ready as Inglewood is.   Kroenke & “burned bridges”: Today, Stan Kroenke has as much affection in Saint Louis & Missouri as Vladimir Putin has in Ukraine. He is hated as much as Christian Laettner is in Lexington, KY. Most fans and non-fans just flat-out hate Kroenke, both individuals and corporations who buy luxury boxes.   Even for the out-state politicians in western Missouri, he’s viewed as a disloyal opportunist, a guy who’s moving a local business out of a successful market for personal financial opportunism in which the State has already invested so much to retain. Even amongst the most business-minded fiscal conservatives in Missouri, he’s viewed as breaking the social contract between a team and its city. He will cost MO thousands of jobs and millions in current tax revenues. And while the Senate bill against Governor Nixon extending the bonds of the EJD passed to the MO House, the real impetus behind it is partisan politics, and the MO House is already working to find viable alternate funding mechanisms that’ll circumvent any further political BS. Meanwhile, they all are pissed at Kroenke for forcing their actions.   Absolutely, the value of any team that locates in LA will rise in private value, and I understand the impetus to make such a deal clearly. I understand him being resentful if he can't relocate. However, it’s not just that he’d take the team from STL, it’s that he already publicly chastised STL & MO when he became owner that we’d ever question his desire to stay in STL & MO. Should the NFL retain the Rams in STL, I see Kroenke still able to be owner and not having it affect the day-to-day of the team, specifically because he has done and said absolutely nothing publicly since he became owner other than (1) introducing Jeff Fisher as coach and (2) making a PR statement about the Sam Bradford trade. That’s been it. He can stay, and remain perfectly secluded like Howard Hughes.   Ever see the movie Major League? You don’t feel bad for the Indians’ owner after Tom Berenger bunts the team into the playoffs, do you?  Last thought: Say STL & MO secure the funding necessary to build the new Riverfront Stadium. The NFL would compel the Rams to stay in STL, because they won’t walk away from an existing market publicly supporting a new stadium (the second in 21 years)…. Say the Chargers and Raiders both cannot secure funding in their home markets. The NFL would move to relocate the Chargers and Raiders to LA, the supposedly preferred “All-California” solution... Given the choice, the NFL would want Inglewood over Carson, for reasons discussed and obvious….      Would the NFL let Kroenke retain ownership in the Rams while acting as landlord to the Chargers and the Raiders? Maybe? I’m really not sure, too many potential conflicts of interest. If not, then I see Kroenke selling his stake in the Rams to fully capitalize on the opportunity of the Inglewood development as potential home for the Chargers and Raiders. I really think he loves the Inglewood real estate development opportunity more than he does owning the Rams. And, I see him more willing to sell his interests in the Rams to secure Inglewood being built than his retaining ownership in the Rams while Carson is built instead of Inglewood.   For any of this to happen, though, STL & MO must first secure funding for the New Riverfront Stadium. Then the dominos will fall, maybe in this way, so that LA gets Inglewood and 2 teams, and STL keeps our football team.   Just a thought."

StLouisRams,300gcz,panderson1988,7,Mon Mar 23 19:23:36 2015 UTC,"Really getting tired of the double talk from the NFL.  I like how their message has moved on from just financing a new stadium to ""Can STL support a team?""  Find another fucking city in America that will seriously consider building two football stadiums in less than 30 years.  It really ticks me off to hear NFL execs basically spouting the same shit Kroenke's camp has been spouting.  Edit:  Nice down votes with no counter points."
StLouisRams,300gcz,Seductive_Santa,4,Thu Mar 26 14:53:22 2015 UTC,They're gonna keep the talk vague as possible because they'll do whatever they want in the end. Whichever route means more $ that's they one they'll take.
StLouisRams,300gcz,panderson1988,3,Thu Mar 26 22:28:06 2015 UTC,"There is an article about the Cardinals being one of the most valuable baseball teams, and most profitable. The Cards value is rank ahead of larger metro areas including LA Angels, Astros, Mets, Nationals, and Marlins. http://www.stltoday.com/sports/columns/bernie-miklasz/bernie-cards-are-mlb-s-most-profitable-team/article_830f1863-411a-576f-922a-1096370407ca.html  Here is my point, but the Cardinals show how successful and profitable a franchise can be when you invest into a constant winning program and invest within the community. Both Bill Bidwell and Kronke didn't do that, or to be honest they suck at it. Kronke sees LA as this short term boosting his value, which is true; however, if they continue to suck, then their value will drop behind other teams like the Angels and Nationals have in baseball, despite them being in large markets. DC has 5 million people in the metro area, which is over 2 million more people then STL, but they are ranked behind the Cardinals. I just wish Stan cared more about his teams because his mediocre records with the Rams to Arsenal really shows his ineptitude as an owner in my opinion."
StLouisRams,300gcz,Seductive_Santa,5,Thu Mar 26 20:03:30 2015 UTC,"Say what you want about LA, but the Angels are one of the finest organizations in baseball. They always field a competitive team and ticket prices are reasonable compared to the Dodgers. The reason their value may be slumping is their aging stadium which is far away from the big $$ in LA county, it's not because they try and boost short term profits or anything like that. For being SoCal's B team, they've done pretty damn well."
StLouisRams,300gcz,panderson1988,2,Thu Mar 26 22:23:03 2015 UTC,"I actually don't mind the Angels, but it shows how a big city can't lift them to the top spot in value. Especially when the big brother and bigger brand Dodgers in town. Same with the Mets, or White Sox. Odd thing is the White Sox have won a World Series within the last decade, but the Cubs are worth more and get more attendance. Also wasn't the Angels stadium renovated within the last decade? I'm always amazed to think their stadium is 50 years old despite it looking in great shape, and having an ASG recently."
StLouisRams,300gcz,bozo7337,3,Thu Mar 26 23:56:59 2015 UTC,"The stadium was renovated about at least 15 years ago, due to both damage from the Northridge Earthquake and to reduce seating with the Rams gone. It's honestly a fantastic place to watch a game, but it's still over 50 years old and Arte Moreno has expressed desire for new digs, possibly in another part or Orange County. Your point does stand about franchise values, the Nationals and probably Angels should be doing better."
StLouisRams,300gcz,downtown41,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:07:02 2015 UTC,"I was surprise to see the Nationals and Phillies that low, but it is what it is. I just hate how people say STL has no value, yet the Cardinals show how a well run franchise can bring in a lot of value. I would love to see the Rams be like Green Bay, or Indy by being a smaller city team that can be good, and be valuable. Indy is in the top 15, and lets be honest, Indy isn't a huge city or metro area. It shows how a good and successful franchise helps a lot in the long run.   Also I didn't know it was 15  years ago. I always liked the rocks they have in the outfield, along with how the bullpens is setup. That said, I can understand their desire for a new stadium. I just hope they stay in Anaheim though, or rename themselves to Anaheim. LA Angels? That sounds wrong since they are 25 miles south of LA. It's like calling the Texas Rangers the Dallas Rangers despite being in Arlington, TX."
StLouisRams,300gcz,bozo7337,-3,Fri Mar 27 00:10:33 2015 UTC,"Do you even follow Premiere League? Aresnal has been top 4 in the league for a decade. Kroenke has had his people in charge for the Rams for 3 years and they have 20 wins in those 3 years, 2 with backup qb's. The previous 5 years they had 15 wins. His people have clearly improved this team. It's so tiring listening to people in St Louis pissing and moaning about how Kroenke's inept. Just keep ignoring the turn around in the team the last 3 years. Spout garbage about Arsenal that proves you have no clue what you're talking about. Blame everybody else that St Louis didn't attend Rams games. I live 4 states and 2000 miles away and have probably been to more games in St Louis than most of the people on here pissing and moaning about the Rams likely leaving.  Also it's really easy for the Cardinals to stay competitive when they get an extra first round pick every year for ""competitive balance"" that they don't deserve. It's too bad people in St Louis don't support the Rams like they do the Cardinals. But then this isn't the first time they've failed to support a football team. I know though it's all the owners fault not the peoples fault."
StLouisRams,300gcz,bozo7337,4,Thu Mar 26 20:51:24 2015 UTC,"How hasn't the community supported the team? Attendance is ridiculously high for the mediocre to pathetic play over the last ten years. The worst rated game this year still is higher than the Card's/Giants games. We have a task force working to create the second stadium funded by the community in 20 years. This team is supported.   Also, you picked the ONE above .500 team Kroenke owns, Arsenal.  I'm not saying he is a bad owner; however, no claim that he has made an investment to the community, like the owners of the Blues and Cards, can be made. That would be the equivalent of making the claim WalMart invests and supports the community."
StLouisRams,300gcz,panderson1988,2,Thu Mar 26 22:23:59 2015 UTC,"He does what I personally prefer owners do with their teams, he hires sports people and let's them run the team. He doesn't place limitations on them and he allows them to do their job. He's the money and let's the sports people run the sports side of it. Look at the Rams. We spend our salary cap money we don't leave 30 million free space like some teams to cut the owners costs. He spens money on coaches, GM and staff and scouts. He fulfills his side, his sports people aren't always the best at their jobs in hindsight but he's no Al Davis or Daniel Snyder, an owner pretending he knows football better than the football people."
StLouisRams,300gcz,D9-EM,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:04:44 2015 UTC,Also just for reference I picked Arsenal because that is the one team other than the Rams of Kroenkes that he mentions.
StLouisRams,300gcz,codesius,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:23:35 2015 UTC,"Kronke also owns the Avalance and Nuggets. Both can make the playoffs in the NBA because they award mediocrity, but besides the Avalanche winning the cup in his first year of being an owner, they haven't had any success. Their cup year was also before he got a chance to install his own people because they won under the old management and guard that was in place. Overall Kronke's teams are medicore losers, with the exception of Arsenal in which it has been somewhat mixed until last year when they finally got out of the 5th spot since he took over. Top 5 is good, but the top 4 is the Champions League with the Top 3 getting into group play, and the 4th spot into a playoff."
StLouisRams,300gcz,LLv2,2,Fri Mar 27 00:01:49 2015 UTC,"Just for curiosity's sake, who do you blame for the poor attendance in the 80s and 90s in Los Angeles leading up to the Rams relocation to Saint Louis? I don't think I've ever heard an LA Rams fan blame anybody but Georgia Frontier.  Edit: No hostility intended, just genuine curiosity."
StLouisRams,300gcz,codesius,4,Thu Mar 26 22:14:31 2015 UTC,A lot of it was like when McCourt owned the Dodgers. The fans hated him and what he was doing so they boycotted the games. No one believed that the Rams would actually move so they did the same type of thing with Frontier. They thought if they didn't show their support she would sell the team not relocate it. Honestly though Saint Louis was her plan the entire time so she had the intention of driving the fans away.
StLouisRams,300gcz,D9-EM,5,Fri Mar 27 15:06:19 2015 UTC,"Carroll Rosenbloom moved the team to Anaheim, not Georgia.  Then the Raiders showed up, won a Super Bowl, and attracted their fan base.  The Rams left SoCal because their stadium situation sucked and another team entered their turf.  St. Louis offered a situation where the team could literally not lose money. Al Davis leaving LA after he had the market all to himself was what was really insane."
StLouisRams,300gcz,TheDuke13,2,Sat Mar 28 06:37:22 2015 UTC,"""Insane"" and ""Al Davis"" just seem so right together in a sentence, don't they?"
StLouisRams,300gcz,D9-EM,-1,Sat Mar 28 16:23:22 2015 UTC,Baltimore was her original plan after she decided that LA wouldn't work. I guess my point is that in both the LA Rams & St. Louis Rams situations it was (is) the venue that play(ed) the the key factor for relocation. Not fan support. Especially in St. Louis where attendance has been increasing for years despite still not having a winning season and the threat of relocation looming.
StLouisRams,300gcz,bozo7337,2,Fri Mar 27 15:30:57 2015 UTC,Attendance may be growing but how much is from visiting teams fans? I'd say it's a majority just by seeing all those visitors fans in the front row. Not to mention the tickets Kroenke buys out of his pocket to avoid a TV blackout.
StLouisRams,300gcz,D9-EM,0,Fri Mar 27 16:40:41 2015 UTC,"While there are usually a lot of opposing fans at games I've never seen it as bad as people make it out to be (in person). The most I've seen in person was maybe 25 percent. And honestly, the red seats make it look much worse then it is.   And Kroenke buying tickets will not effect attendance numbers. They are on the rise because more people are going to games."
StLouisRams,300gcz,bozo7337,4,Fri Mar 27 17:12:19 2015 UTC,The fans and the stripper.  One thing also to look at is the Rams attendance when compared to league averages most years under Georgia they were over league average. It wasn't until the last four years in Anaheim that it really dropped off. At that point the fans had tired so much off her they abandoned the team. I'm in no way saying I think it's all sunshine and happiness in LA with blind support. I just get tired of baseless posts always blaming everything on Kroenke. He has his portion of the blame but not all of it.
StLouisRams,300gcz,SoulardSTL,4,Thu Mar 26 23:20:08 2015 UTC,I think people put Kroenkes name on the blame card because he owns the team when it's really the fault of the organization as a whole (including past owners and front office personal). If you look at the win/loss ratios across the NFL in the past 10 years the Rams sit at 31st just edging out the Raiders by 3 or 4 wins. That is terrible. It's really not a product that can expect good or even average sales.   Just my 2 cents.
StLouisRams,300gcz,bozo7337,2,Thu Mar 26 23:48:29 2015 UTC,I agree the product is has been bad for a long time and that gives people less desire to go support them. Yet those same people who won't support them because they've been bad are freaking out at the prospect of losing the team. So they won't support them but they don't want to lose them. The whole situation sucks and tbh there's no easy answer.
StLouisRams,300gcz,Kaos047,3,Fri Mar 27 00:19:08 2015 UTC,"Lots of the blame for how shitty the Rams had been goes to Chip Rosenbloom and his sister, Lucia Rodriguez, when they took the reigns after Georgia's death. They truly had no idea what the hell to do with the team. Their time as primary owners saw the 15-65 streak, the head coaching careers of Linehan and Spagnuolo, and the superstar mentality of making Sam Bradford one of the highest paid players in the NFL right out of the draft without getting him any front line protection. Their minds were much more on the inheritance taxes they owed. Plus, they were absentee owners, both living in LA throughout their majority ownership. They still do today, even as he's #2 in supposed team leadership and she's in charge of the team's philanthropic activities.   Kroenke's assumption of majority ownership does coincide with Jeff Fisher becoming head coach and a better product on the field, absolutely. Credit where it's due. Still, the continued neglect of the fan base by the Organization carries on under Kroenke's tenure. And at no times have they put a dime into the stadium.   It should be noted that both Rosenbloom and Rodriguez retain about 30% of team equity that Kroenke is still to buy-out at a non-public later date. This I bet has an incredible amount to do with the behind-the-scenes plans, I think more than any of us will ever know."

Credit where it's due. Still, the continued neglect of the fan base by the Organization carries on under Kroenke's tenure. And at no times have they put a dime into the stadium.   What neglect of the fan base? The Rams are as active in the community as any other pro sports team. Also Kroenke doesn't own the EJD the city/CVC own it it's theirs to upgrade. It's not his responsibility nor is it his obligation contractually to upgrade the EJD. The fact that the CVC lost the arbitration on the contractual upgrades to the EJD is what led us to the point where he could move the team."
StLouisRams,300gcz,Popolar,3,Fri Mar 27 21:41:52 2015 UTC,"The Rams are as active in the community as any other pro sports team.   This goes to show you either dont live in STL, or dont pay attention. To say the Rams have even half the presence the Blues and Cardinals do is asinine."
StLouisRams,300gcz,panderson1988,3,Sat Mar 28 16:24:22 2015 UTC,"The man hasn't spoken publicly since buying the team. We are totally in the dark with what's going on with the team. If he even had the decency to just say, ""Hey, Saint Louis, I'm maybe going to move the Rams to LA if y'all don't do something big for me"", that would be fucking wonderful! Instead, he's twice talked: right before he assumed majority ownership, and when he hired Jeff Fisher. There was a tweet a couple weeks ago about Sam Bradford, and that's been it.   I'd call that the very definition of neglect of the fan base.   Meanwhile, the CVC has been upgrading the EJD for some time, including new scoreboards and a total revamping of the club boxes. It would be nice if ownership put a dollar into care of the facility, too. And for them to demand a $750MM retrofit without a willingness to extend the lease, it's no wonder the CVC said no to that expansion. It was an arbitration loss, but it very well could have ended up a relocation of the team in 9 years anyways after the retrofit, all on the public's dime. I'd say the unwillingness to sign a long-term commitment even if the region conducted a $750MM retrofit on the EJD can be considered tantamount to a reasonable neglect."
StLouisRams,300gcz,TheDuke13,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:43:17 2015 UTC,"The way you word this excludes the fact that the team has yet to have a winning record despite Kroenke's ownership. The Rams are better than they were, no doubt, but a losing record is a losing record.  It's still shit, just less smelly shit. You even said it, we have had 2 backup QBs in 3 years. He may be improving the team, but despite his efforts the team is still not a contender (as of right now). From what I understand, most fans are not going to go to a game because they know the owner is trying to improve the team. They are going to go to games because they want to watch their team contend and possibly win. I'm no football guru, but back up quarterbacks tend to be not so good, and they also have a real tough time winning games.  You say that you live 2000 miles away from St. Louis, so you really can't speak on how supportive St. Louis is or how inept Kroenke is. All you probably go off of are articles, and judging by your stance on this, they appear to be really bias and anti-St. Louis.  Lastly, how on earth are you going to compare the average attendances of a baseball team that is a perennial World Series contender to a football team that has had nine consecutive losing seasons?"
StLouisRams,300gcz,Viperking5,0,Thu Mar 26 23:45:00 2015 UTC,"Kronke took over Arsenal recently, and he had one year they played in top 3. Since he took over they have missed more times then not on making the Champions League group play rounds. They have qualified for the play in games. Arsenal has recovered a bit this year taking over Man U in the third spot, thank god because I hate Man U.   Also his teams in Denver have been mediocre, and it's why Denver fans question Kronke's leadership. Also Kronke has only had full control since the mid 2000s, and his hiring have been mediocre under Fischer, and awful under Spags. The winning years was Frontier's doing.   Also the Rams have had the worst record in the NFL behind the Raiders within the last 10 years, and their sellout rate was in the 90% range. Find me a team with those numbers a solid attendance number. I'll wait.   Also I could say LA's support for the NFL has been piss poor because you lost two teams with many blackouts. I saw pictures of the Raiders and Rams in the 90s. Pathetic."

Sure it'll be a success the first, let's say 5 seasons but after that it'll go downhill. Los Angeles isn't a football town at all. And the football we do watch is USC or UCLA.

He has the physical ability to be a true #1 WR, which is enough to want him to keep him, but after watching some of his ""mic'd up"" videos, this dude is going to be vital to the success of our offense.

StLouisRams,2zpj8t,Kazzad,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:03:49 2015 UTC,"Whoa, whoa. They didn't ruin him. They certainly didn't utilize him to the fullest, however. It blows my mind that he rarely ran in sets with a FB. They gave him a dedicated FB one year and he runs for 2,053 yards and the next year they be like ""eh, who needs a fullback"".   The Lions in the early 90s actually had a pretty loaded roster. Pro Bowlers like Lomas Brown, Kevin Glover, Robert Porcher, Chris Spielman, Bennie Blades, Herman Moore, etc. The problem was that they peaked during the Cowboys/49ers era, and they didn't exactly have an Aikman or Steve Young."

On the one hand, I'm upset that the eagles traded away their starting quarterback for a guy who I've watched spend most of his career injured, even if he is good healthy. I totally understand why the rams Bradford up, seeing as how he's a huge salary that they've been getting no return on. On the other hand, I'm optimistic about what both QBs can accomplish with their new starts."
StLouisRams,2zp4ak,mateoelgigante,3,Fri Mar 20 18:17:04 2015 UTC,Foles really has me impressed with the way he speaks in this article.   Comes across as very mature and level-headed.  I really like his attitude going forward and what it takes to build a true team and a solid relationship with his teammates.  Excited to have him here.
StLouisRams,2zp4ak,daedalus000,1 point,Fri Mar 20 22:54:27 2015 UTC,"He's not the most vocal QB, but he's poised.  The way he bounced back and fired up his teammates after the bench-clearing brawl in our 1st game against D.C. (where he was clobbered during a pick) was impressive"
StLouisRams,2zp4ak,DabDastic,2,Sat Mar 21 01:12:36 2015 UTC,Couldn't be more excited to have him here. Hopefully he can gel with the recovers and build a good relationship this offseason and we can get a decent line after the draft to keep him healthy.

StLouisRams,2zl4iu,FaulktheBlueRedbird,-4,Thu Mar 19 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yes.   There isn't a QB mid-late round better than Davis/Hill, two guys who have already had more than their share of starts for the team."

StLouisRams,2zl4iu,jts81,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:16:12 2015 UTC,As somebody posted above we worked out Carr as well and I'm somewhat doubting we go QB any earlier than round 5 after our acquisition of Foles. Davis is a good enough backup when the team is healthy and we gave up a 7th for Keenum so it seems were treading lightly in that regard.
StLouisRams,2zl4iu,hampsted,5,Thu Mar 19 18:39:08 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, if the Snish think they see a hidden gem in rd 3 or 4, they could draft him.  Keenum can easily be cut."
StLouisRams,2zl4iu,hampsted,3,Thu Mar 19 18:50:02 2015 UTC,That's sounds like a filthy name for a vagina
StLouisRams,2zl4iu,hampsted,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"Keenum can easily be cut.   That would be odd. Texans acquired him from the Rams practice squad. Then the Rams trade a 7th round pick to the Texans for Keenum only to cut him again? The front office would look like jackasses. I don't think the Rams have any intention of drafting a quarterback in this draft. I think it would take Petty falling really far (5th round probably) for them to jump on a QB. Maybe take a long shot on some guy in the 7th with no expectations of him making the team? Everybody's looking for their Brady, I guess."
StLouisRams,2zl4iu,DiscoJer,1 point,Mon Mar 23 10:35:47 2015 UTC,"I think the team has more important things to worry about than Keenum's feelings.  If (hypothetically) the Rams think Petty could be ""their Brady"" as you put it, they could draft him and cut Keenum.  They only traded a 7th for him and he's a fringe NFL talent, at best."
StLouisRams,2zl4iu,axle69,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:10:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you don't trade draft picks for a third quarterback if you're planning on drafting another quarterback in a high round. It has nothing to do with Keenum's feelings. It has everything to do with giving away draft picks for nothing. I just can't imagine that Les Snead is that dumb. I seriously, seriously doubt the Rams take a QB in the first 3 rounds."
StLouisRams,2zl4iu,hampsted,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:29:49 2015 UTC,"It's narrow-minded to think that the Rams won't draft a QB because they traded a 7th round pick (which is worth next to nothing) for a fringe NFL talent.  It's called covering their asses in case a guy who they want (again, hypothetically) such as Bryce Petty doesn't fall to the 4th round or something.    Nick Foles probably isn't the long term answer at QB and if Snead thinks there's a guy available in the middle rounds who could be the answer they should absolutely draft him - regardless of whether or not they traded a 7th for Case friggin Keenum."
StLouisRams,2zl4iu,TweetPoster,2,Mon Mar 23 20:55:52 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, Petty's not worth the Rams 3rd round pick and they don't have a 4th. It would be a poor move to take a quarterback in the first 3 rounds when you have more pressing needs, especially since the QB class drops off in a huge way after Winston and Mariota. Petty is not the answer. I watched him the past 2 years in the Big 12. He's very whiny. Always seems to be more concerned with himself than the team. You should have seen him running his own Heisman campaign in interviews last season. IMHO, he's not the guy you want leading your football team. But hey, we'll see how it shakes out on draft day."
StLouisRams,2zl4iu,3146669420,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:36:45 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree that the Rams should not be taking a QB in the first 3 rounds unless they can somehow get Winston or Mariota (extremely unlikely).  I wasn't advocating for Petty either, I haven't seen enough of him to have an informed opinion. I just don't think we should rule out the chance that the Rams draft a QB because we traded for Keenum."
StLouisRams,2zl4iu,washeduplegend,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:10:17 2015 UTC,Foles is only signed for this year though.  What happens next year? We need to take a QB in this draft and I think Petty is one of the best options.

StLouisRams,2zhdsx,evil_disco_man,-4,Wed Mar 18 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"Bonus for staying sober and bonus for working out have nothing to do with each other, so not sure what you are trying to say.  I do get paid at my work for training and doing things that make me better at my job, such as going to seminars and classes. Most employers gladly pay you to train. Why should physical training be any different if your job requires it? If my employer required me to train without compensating me, I'd go work somewhere else."

StLouisRams,2zha8s,Ihateunerds,6,Wed Mar 18 23:28:23 2015 UTC,I'd really love to see us more active on Wisniewski.
StLouisRams,2zha8s,TheLawbanger,4,Fri Mar 20 04:19:20 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with having a healthy level of concern over it. It is a very glaring need.       But there's still plenty of time left in free agency and beyond. Wiz and Blaylock still haven't signed with anybody. And we're going to be in position to grab a blue-chip lineman at #10.        Remember, Fisher not only spent the #2 overall pick on OL last year, he was ready to trade back into the first round to grab another one (Zack Martin, who ended up being a pro bowler) had the Cowboys not sniped him before our trade partners' pick was up. I have my doubts about Fisher, but I don't doubt that he knows the seriousness of the situation at OL."
StLouisRams,2zha8s,Yji,4,Wed Mar 18 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"I think a lot depends on Barksdale.  If we re-sign him, we are looking good to load up on OL in the draft and maybe also sign Wiz.  I think that will be more than enough.  Have Saffold, Robinson, Barksdale and a lot of bodies competing for the rest.  That will make it more than fine I think."
StLouisRams,2zha8s,TB_Punters,5,Wed Mar 18 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"R-E-L-A-X  I believe the Rams have it planned to bring back Barksdale, which is a huge start not having to worry about our RT going into the draft.   The Rams Instagram has been posting a bunch of mini profiles for interior lineman. Guys like Grassu, Dismukes, Erving, etc. I think its obvious (OR they are doing a great job at making it seem so) they mean to fix that center slot on day two in the draft. That leaves our first rounder to pick a guard at #10 like Scherff or trade back and grab a guy like AJ Cann.   Don't worry too much until Barksdale signs elsewhere, or we fail to fix the interior in the draft."
StLouisRams,2zha8s,TheLawbanger,2,Wed Mar 18 18:22:01 2015 UTC,The only way I'd be ok with taking Scherf is if White and Cooper are both off the board.  If we're honest WR1 is as big a need as O Line. If we resign Barksdale and maybe another like Wisnewski then we can fill the rest of the interior line out in later rounds.
StLouisRams,2zha8s,RamsWillFly,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:57:39 2015 UTC,Picking a guard in the first round is already stupid. On top of the fact that no o-line is worth a top 10 pick in this draft.
StLouisRams,2zha8s,PRE_-CISION-_,6,Thu Mar 19 04:26:02 2015 UTC,Picking Zack Martin was stupid for the Cowboys?

StLouisRams,2zisdo,frankoftank,11,Wed Mar 18 22:38:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not buying the hype, but if he can stay healthy than he'll serve us better than Bradford has and cost us about $13 mil less. Also, he can't be worse than Clemons, Davis or Hill, so he'll be an upgrade over our starting QBs from the last two years.   All I want from foles is health and average QB play, and I think he can give us that."
StLouisRams,2zisdo,frankoftank,-10,Wed Mar 18 23:11:08 2015 UTC,"Health is a question for Foles also.  Missed one game in 2012 with a broken hand (would've been many more if he didn't happen to break it in Week 16), Missed a game with a concussion in 2013, and 8 with the collar bone last year.  I believe he had injury issues going back to college as well.  If everything is even and both Foles & Bradford are healthy, it's pretty clear that Bradford is the much better QB.  But obviously, that health is a MAJOR concern."
StLouisRams,2zisdo,Demonthehusky,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"There's a big difference between breaking bones and tearing your ACL. Bones heal and become stronger where the break occurred, joints like the ACL become less flexible where they are repaired and scarred, which makes it easier to tear in the future. Broken bones happen, can't really predict them. Bradford has torn the same ACL twice and it wouldn't surprise anybody if it happened again.  I am worried about the concussion though. Much like ligament damage, getting a concussion makes you more prone to future concussions, and much like the eagles our O line is suspect."
StLouisRams,2zisdo,wowbagger88,-2,Thu Mar 19 17:13:22 2015 UTC,"Injuries are injuries.  Bones breaking may not be the same as an ACL, but he's still a QB who has yet to make it healthy through one 16 game NFL season."
StLouisRams,2zisdo,RamsWillFly,-15,Sun Mar 22 20:59:30 2015 UTC,"Health is a question for Foles also.

StLouisRams,2zisdo,Venicide1492,9,Wed Mar 18 23:14:58 2015 UTC,"You make some really good points, but I think what excites Rams fans is the ability to move forward. For years the team has been hamstrung by Bradford's health. If Foles can stay healthy, the Rams will make a playoff push. They just need him to maintain the ball and give the defense a few breaks so they can dominate each game."
StLouisRams,2zisdo,dr_superman,4,Wed Mar 18 23:16:11 2015 UTC,"I've mellowed on the pick up and wonder if the Rams pick up a QB in the middle of the draft. Foles still could turn out great, but it's a gamble.  I think it only makes sense if the Rams are convinced Bradford can't stay healthy and I'd agree with them on that point. His last injury was on a really weak play. He didn't even look hurt. He walked off the field and watched. I felt bad for him, but I immediately said ""there goes his career."" I hope he stays healthy with you guys but I think he'll have a Palmer like next couple of years. He'll do good for you this year and the next he'll go down again.   Or maybe he turns it around like Stafford and Rams fans are left to think about what could have been. I'm not betting on it though, and neither was FishSnead when they made the deal.  As for Foles, I hope he stays healthy and does better than Austin Davis or Shaun Hill. If he can play middle of the road and not lose games, which might be a problem if he's turnover prone, he'll do good on the team."
StLouisRams,2zisdo,Cloud324,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:48:04 2015 UTC,I say we Draft a QB next year if Foles doesn't work out.
StLouisRams,2zisdo,wowbagger88,-9,Thu Mar 19 03:19:52 2015 UTC,"I was a HUGE Foles supporter in '13.  We all were, haha.  I really REALLY wanted him to work out and be good.  I genuinely like the guy, he's just not really that great.  I hope for your sake that he plays a lot better than last year, but the excuses people threw out here about getting rid of ONE of his weapons and the OL, it sounds like you guys have the same issues, which makes it worrysome.  I honestly think if Bradford can stay on the field, he's gonna do some damage for us.  From some of the film study I've seen, he's got the skill set (quick release, going through progressions, throws with anticipation, etc) to run this offense no problem.  I'd rather see him play in our offense healthy than Mariota to be honest.  However, I do realize the very real possibility that he's just a walking ACL tear and then we'll be faced with another year of Mark Sanchez..... And that's why we have the most money allocated to RBs in the NFL besides Minnesota!"
StLouisRams,2zisdo,porkfish66,2,Wed Mar 18 23:08:47 2015 UTC,"well to be fair, things like "" a WR making a great catch"" happen because in a small part to  quarterback leadership.  the intangibles that go into any football play are so numerous to list is basically impossible.   Nick Foles is the QB the Rams need. I am sorry he flamed out in Philadelphia, but honestly Sam Bradford is washed up.  In a few years Sam Bradford will call Jake Locher, Locher will be walking around having fun playing golf and enjoying basketball with his kids. Bradford will barely be able to stand, battling a pain killer addiction, and i hope it wont be that sad."
StLouisRams,2zisdo,Ihateunerds,2,Thu Mar 19 04:11:40 2015 UTC,"Lurker from r/eagles here,as well. While I can't disagree with much of what my colleague said here, I do think a change of scenery will work wonders for Foles.  I also think he is a starting caliber QB in the NFL.  Philly never really committed to him.  Whether coaches, fans, pundits or forum posters, he was always on the bubble here.  Its a gamble, but a good one.  You cleared out Bradford's contract and are paying Foles a pittance by comparison.  There's a lot of upside and not much downside.  If Foles works out, great. If not, you can easily move on."
StLouisRams,2zisdo,dr_superman,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:49:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  It seems like OP really just wanted to come in and shit on our ""new QB"" party by trying to tell us he actually sucks.  We know he isn't going to post the 27-2 again, but I think Foles is capable of league average QB play, which we haven't seen for a long time.  I think both Foles and Bradford needed a change of scenery and should do both of them good.  Foles finally gets the support of a front office, and Bradford won't have to try living up to being a 1st overall pick and savior of a franchise, and can just concentrate on playing football."
StLouisRams,2zisdo,Soaring_Seagull,-1,Thu Mar 19 21:18:41 2015 UTC,"Really, the upside for Foles is that you cleared out Bradford's contract.  If he can try not to give the other team the ball too much this year, stop running out of clean pockets, and notice wide open receivers, then he'll be great, but I really don't see that happening.  I'm glad we got rid of him tbh."

He sucked in 2013, Texans let him go. He then goes to Oakland where he proves that he can't even manage to be a serviceable stop gap quarterback and the team is basically forced to start Carr. Trading for Bradford with your extra 1st round pick makes infinitely more sense from a potential perspective than thinking signing Matt Schaub is going to do anything but add to your QB woes. Brian Hoyer's 2014 was about as good as Schaub's 2013. If you are going to settle on a crappy QB keep the guy who already knows the offense in Hoyer, don't sign Schaub who is very likely even worse than he was in 2013."

StLouisRams,2ze8dh,kersey79,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:04:39 2015 UTC,Givens was so promising as a rookie with that speed but now he's definitely the odd man out especially if we grab a late round WR.
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,jts81,10,Tue Mar 17 19:40:45 2015 UTC,Opinions on Janoris Jenkins are weird. A lot of metric sites show he does really well in coverage. Most of those big blown plays were zone coverages where HE did NOT have the ultimate responsibility. He was a Pro Bowl alternate.
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,NewBroPewPew,14,Tue Mar 17 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying, but this sub tends to be all ""Hurr durr Jenkins sucks."" Oh well."
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,hack5amurai,5,Tue Mar 17 21:41:04 2015 UTC,When it's time to sign a new contract people are gonna realize how good he is.  Dudes gonna get paid.
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,ThirdTimesAnAlt,5,Tue Mar 17 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"Even when Fisher says that it wasn't his fault, people still jump on the ""Jenkins is shit"" Express. This sub is freaking weird sometimes."
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,wowbagger88,2,Wed Mar 18 02:00:53 2015 UTC,"Player coaches will never throw their players under the bus. Not to mention, Jeff Fisher has proven that he has no intent on being honest with the media.  EDIT: Not that I'm mad about that. I understand it and I think it's stupid to expect coaches and players to be honest in interviews. ""Yeah, so and so sucks. We'll upgrade come the draft."""
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,Ihateunerds,3,Wed Mar 18 03:55:29 2015 UTC,He's also a great open field tackler.  He's a home run threat every time the QB drops back. He's just not the kind of physical press corner lining up at the line of scrimmage people want him to be.
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,QUINNtessentialTruth,8,Wed Mar 18 02:39:15 2015 UTC,"I actually don't think we have any Defensive position to worry about this year.  Great D-line depth.  5 deep in Linebackers, and good enough with more improvement from Gaines and Joyner yet to come.  We will be fine.  I would be more than happy to use all our picks on OL and QB.  Edit: good enough in secondary*"
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,Wm_TheConqueror,2,Tue Mar 17 20:22:57 2015 UTC,"You think QB? I could see taking 1 QB in the later rounds, but not focusing half the draft on QB."
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,QUINNtessentialTruth,3,Wed Mar 18 19:24:53 2015 UTC,I just meant to make sure we draft a QB no matter what still.  Of course not more than 1.  Especially with Davis and Keenum still on the roster.
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,SaucemanXL,2,Wed Mar 18 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"Other than not being sold on our FS spot (I'm just not a huge fan of McLeod), I would agree with everything said (including Scherff at #10). I really would like to have a legitimate centerfielder on the roster so that our CBs can play the bump a little better, and so that McD can pressure the box like he wants.  Great writeup."
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,wowbagger88,2,Tue Mar 17 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"Looking at who he's picked up so far, I don't think Fisher is a fan of free safeties. Googling ""Jeff Fisher free safety"" comes up with an article from his Titans days saying that they were loaded at strong safety but light at free safety. Does that sound familiar?  Unfortunately, I don't think the Rams are getting a true, ball hawk free safety with Fisher at the helm. He seems to like guys who can be a little bit of both, with an emphasis towards the strong safety types."
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,SaucemanXL,2,Wed Mar 18 04:11:35 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if I refuse to look at Fisher's draft history. See ""Jeff Fisher First Round OL"" for the myth that was busted last year."

StLouisRams,2zdvm8,porkfish66,0,Tue Mar 17 22:38:09 2015 UTC,"Depends. If we go O-Line in the first or trade down, I'm all for it. If not, O-Line all the way."
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,bwc_28,0,Tue Mar 17 22:44:35 2015 UTC,"Jenkins to me always felt like a slot CB and nothing more , he gets beat/does something stupid too many times for my liking. I hope Gaines will take his spot so it can be Gaines and Johnson at the 1 and 2"
StLouisRams,2zdvm8,bwc_28,6,Tue Mar 17 20:50:09 2015 UTC,Jenkins could be a top notch corner if he didn't gamble so damn much.
StLouisRams,2zb28q,xKeyNin,21,Tue Mar 17 02:23:21 2015 UTC,Wow.  Good for him being able to make that decision.  Really sucks for the niners this offseason.

StLouisRams,2zb28q,porkfish66,4,Tue Mar 17 02:46:48 2015 UTC,"Seriously, all niners hate aside (which is a lot) its impressive that a 24 year old is able to just walk away and look towards the future. I cant imagine how hard it is to turn down the lifestyle that comes with being in the NFL at such a young age."
StLouisRams,2zb28q,BBinning,2,Tue Mar 17 04:40:21 2015 UTC,I'll give him his props for making a truly tough decision - but how long has he been playing football? Isn't this something he probably should have thought about sooner?
StLouisRams,2zb28q,dah00psta,12,Tue Mar 17 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"Wow. When it rains in Ninerland it fucking pours. If it gets any worse, the Bay Area bandwagoners are going to have to pull their Raiders gear out of storage."
StLouisRams,2zb28q,BrawndoTTM,4,Tue Mar 17 04:30:49 2015 UTC,I'm just waiting for the new season. Imagine the confusion from the bandwagoners who haven't followed the off-season. Going to be super confused why they are in last
StLouisRams,2zb28q,sjphilsphan,11,Tue Mar 17 06:01:13 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is shocking!   Great news for anyone like me who hates the Niners with a passion."
StLouisRams,2zb28q,DeniseDeNephew,4,Tue Mar 17 02:57:19 2015 UTC,This is bigger than the niners at this point.  This can have major ramifications for the league
StLouisRams,2zb28q,ConcedeDota,4,Tue Mar 17 04:40:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I think there will always be enough guys from poor backgrounds who will be willing to take the risks to earn millions playing football for any of the doomsday scenarios about the demise of the NFL to come true.   Plenty of guys take bigger risks joining gangs, selling drugs, etc.  Those things aren't going away just because the people in them are at risk of dying young, so I don't expect a significant number of players either retiring or never starting the sport due to the risk of brain injury.   I think we'll see rules changes and improved helmet technology first.    But maybe this is all just wishful thinking on my part because I'd rather watch 1 NFL game than 10 of any other sport."
StLouisRams,2zb28q,DeniseDeNephew,2,Tue Mar 17 05:40:13 2015 UTC,"Not even poor. Hell, I'm a lawyer, but if I magically woke up 6'6"" and 300 pounds, I would leave my job and try out for the NFL in a second. The money and glory are 100000% worth the risk of injury for most people. Plus you don't even have to go to biker gangs and drug dealers. Cops, soldiers, firemen, fishermen, electricians and welders all take way bigger risks going to work every day."

StLouisRams,2zbzxv,TorchedBannana,10,Tue Mar 17 09:08:10 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna go ahead break this down real fast. Zac is a bowling ball, he hits hard and may even knock down several guys on 1 play, but he won't break off too many long runs. Zac isn't great in pass protection. Benny is solid in his pass protection, he is also a solid receiving threat. Benny has more ypc, but on less attempts than Stacy.  Benny is a little taller and Stacy is a little heavier."
StLouisRams,2zbzxv,corbilm,5,Tue Mar 17 13:18:50 2015 UTC,I like zac more  .... But. Cunningham will get it
StLouisRams,2zbzxv,WhamBamCham2,13,Tue Mar 17 09:16:03 2015 UTC,"I kinda wish we'd trade Stacy. He's a solid starter who didn't do anything to lose his job, yet Fisher seems determined not to use him."
StLouisRams,2zbzxv,axle69,7,Tue Mar 17 10:13:22 2015 UTC,He lost his jobs because he wasn't as good as Mason. I agree I'd like to see him start again but Tre was better and Cunningham is a prototypical third down back who can block and is versatile. Zac was just the odd man out.
StLouisRams,2zbzxv,One_Half_Hamster,1 point,Tue Mar 17 14:53:54 2015 UTC,"And it didn't help that when Stacy wasn't producing in the beginning of the season, Mason was. Whether or not Stacy deserved to lose the position doesn't matter because Mason sure as hell deserved to have it."
StLouisRams,2zbzxv,the_logistician,3,Tue Mar 17 18:52:47 2015 UTC,"It's like Corbilm said, Zac is consistent yet has almost 0 big play potential.  Poor man's Jerome Bettis in a world of explosive, elusive backs.  Benny hits the hole HARD with reckless abandon.  Benny obviously is a very hard worker, coming from MTSU and becoming a key part of special teams.  Like someone said, Fisher is in love with pass blocking backs.  Stacy & Mason both struggle with this.  Cunningham does not."
StLouisRams,2zbzxv,ClitorisNigga,2,Tue Mar 17 14:00:15 2015 UTC,Doesnt matter. Our 2nd and 3rd RB will probably get an equal amount of carries.
StLouisRams,2zbzxv,axle69,2,Tue Mar 17 10:29:43 2015 UTC,Easily Cunningham for me it's not close. Unless you're at the goal line Benny is extremely versatile. He has the best blocking by a back on the team he can break through a hole almost as good as Zac can to begin with and he's easily our best receiving back.
StLouisRams,2zbzxv,ITameFatGirls,1 point,Tue Mar 17 14:52:05 2015 UTC,Yea I like Benny too but that's not a knock on Zac.  I could see us netting a 6th for him come draft time.
StLouisRams,2zbzxv,Yji,2,Tue Mar 17 17:02:24 2015 UTC,Benny. So much more versatile.
StLouisRams,2z9wjr,lakerfan91,3,Mon Mar 16 20:57:27 2015 UTC,Sounds like a pretty good price to me.
StLouisRams,2z9wjr,BrawndoTTM,4,Mon Mar 16 21:47:06 2015 UTC,"Seems reasonable. A little on the high side for a situational/rotational linebacker, but I can live with it, especially if Williams has an expanded role for him in mind."
StLouisRams,2z9wjr,frankoftank,2,Tue Mar 17 00:38:00 2015 UTC,"He's an upgrade over Dunbar, younger and still appears cheaper. I love it."
StLouisRams,2z9wjr,TGMurray,5,Tue Mar 17 06:34:16 2015 UTC,"For comparison, Dunbar signed a 2 year $2.05 mil with $1.45 mil in incentives.

StLouisRams,2zdts7,Kaos047,6,Tue Mar 17 19:37:21 2015 UTC,Akili Smith and Ryan Leaf are looking for him too.
StLouisRams,2zdts7,Kicker0fE1ves,9,Tue Mar 17 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"Seriously, anyone who thinks Sam is the biggest bust in NFL history has no clue what they're talking about. He's at least good when he's been healthy."
StLouisRams,2zdts7,bwc_28,-4,Tue Mar 17 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with talent, more to do with where he was drafted and what he did for our team. He was unlucky because of injuries, but if you're acting like injuries keep someone from being a bust, then you're clearly wrong."
StLouisRams,2zdts7,bwc_28,6,Tue Mar 17 19:54:13 2015 UTC,"I never said he wasn't a bust, but he is obviously not the biggest bust ever. That's not even a debate. Find me any legit sportswriter who think he's the biggest bust in NFL history. Hell, many wouldn't even call Sam the biggest bust in RAMS history (Lawrence Phillips anyone?)"
StLouisRams,2zdts7,bozo7337,0,Tue Mar 17 20:00:20 2015 UTC,"So he was the most talented bust in history? How bout worst topic in this sub history. Your point is wrong, he's not even the Rams biggest bust. You say he was good but a bust. Honestly your OP is incoherent and inconsistent and wrong."
StLouisRams,2zdts7,OldOrder,0,Tue Mar 17 21:12:54 2015 UTC,"I can claim someone to be a bust based on their impact on the team. Sam played decent, but his contract was enormous, he was always injured and we never produced anything with him as our starter. The idea of him being the last non wage scale rookie contract means he had the biggest cap hit of any rookie, which also kept us from signing others, which would've been worth it... But he didn't play up to his potential (for whatever reason).  Also, being the last non wage scaled rookie contract put extra hype on Bradford, and he never lived up to that hype. Just because you like him and he was unfortunate doesn't mean what I've said isn't true. People liked David Carr, but I still consider him a bust. I'm not saying it was even bradford's fault, but he was a major bust for us."
StLouisRams,2zdts7,jts81,-4,Tue Mar 17 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"He won 18 games of 41 started, while Jamarcus played won 7 of the 18 games started. We payed Bradford much more than Jamarcus."

StLouisRams,2zdts7,NewBroPewPew,5,Tue Mar 17 21:12:25 2015 UTC,Sam is going to be in the playoffs with Philly and he will make the pro bowl and be comeback player of the year. I GUARANTEE all of that.

StLouisRams,2zbbmp,ismizz,1 point,Tue Mar 17 05:18:58 2015 UTC,I think we should be going BPA rather than locking into a specific position and reaching for needs.  Kind of goes against what Snisher have done the last few years.
StLouisRams,2zbbmp,Bskrilla,4,Tue Mar 17 19:07:24 2015 UTC,"A couple big IFs for me.    1) IF we sign 2/3 of Barksdale, Wis, Blalock. and  2) IF Amari Cooper is there at #10. Then We take Amari Cooper no question.  He's a stud, and you go BPA. Period.   If we sign 1/3 of those 3 OL then we have to go lineman even if Cooper/White is there at 10."
StLouisRams,2zbbmp,D33GS,2,Tue Mar 17 06:12:52 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I hope we do get Barksdale, Wis and Blalock.  That would be so nice.  Plus Cooper....OMG"
StLouisRams,2zbbmp,BrawndoTTM,2,Wed Mar 18 02:08:12 2015 UTC,Based on the FA signing the Rams seem content not going WR in the first round.
StLouisRams,2zbbmp,BeefyMcFlaps,2,Tue Mar 17 04:08:05 2015 UTC,"I hope this is the case.  I'm content with our WR, especially with Foles now and our O line needs some work.  I think Blalock, Wis, Mathis, Barksdale and a first rounder would help solidify.  If we can get two or three of those, then I'll be happy.  Robinson, Blalock, Wis, La'el Collins and Barksdale is a nice Oline."
StLouisRams,2zbbmp,bleedblue89,2,Tue Mar 17 04:23:12 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Saffold. He's an elite guard when healthy. I know he almost never is, but still..."

Most boards have them ranked as the 2nd and 3rd best players in the entire draft.  So while I think we need to go OL, if one of these 2 guys it there at 10, we draft him.  No matter what happens between now and then.  It's a no brainer.  I'll be severely disappointed if we pick a need over one of these studs.  They could be a game changer."
StLouisRams,2zbbmp,MaceWindude,1 point,Tue Mar 17 18:34:34 2015 UTC,I agree with this line of thinking.  Starting quality linemen can generally be found throughout the draft.  Difference-making talents at WR are a lot less common (with the exception of last year's draft).

StLouisRams,2z8hdv,axle69,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:17:33 2015 UTC,I agree don't get me wrong but we had Austin Davis toss back to back 3 TD games with mostly impressive TD's. What I want is a dude who can consistently throw 2 TD's a game minimum.
StLouisRams,2z8hdv,slogsmagobes,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:42:34 2015 UTC,"True, Davis really did play well there for a few games.  Looking back, I'm still not sure why we put Shaun Hill back in as starter.  If Davis could have just gotten his 4th quarter INTs under control, I think he could have given us a better shot at winning late in the year."
StLouisRams,2z8hdv,NFLVideoConverterBot,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:52:37 2015 UTC,Well Austin Davis didn't have the experience and he didn't have any pass rush awareness for shit after our line got hurt. The KC game and second SF game were bad and he needed to be pulled just to not discourage him. I think Davis can be good and even be a starter but he has to get the awareness down a little better so he's not chucking it off his back foot and throwing interceptions or getting sacked.
StLouisRams,2z8hdv,NFLVideoConverterBot,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:37:25 2015 UTC,Can Philly get Nicky back pls? :(
StLouisRams,2z8r06,TacoxOFxBell,8,Mon Mar 16 15:56:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on what happens between now and then. If we re-sign Barksdale, our sole focus on the line will be the interior. If we don't, we are going to need to focus on getting a right tackle first."
StLouisRams,2z8r06,The_Wayward,4,Mon Mar 16 16:23:40 2015 UTC,"I would say Peat and Collins would be still on the board for our pick. Best move is to trade down and get some extra picks, since there are plenty mid 1st round level OL in this draft that we can take. If we need a center, Erving could be another choice, but I think we can get a good C around 3rd round"
StLouisRams,2z8r06,jjangness,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"I like Peat as well. He is very polished in both run and pass blocking. I would also like a center in the 3rd for some depth and a battle could a raise for the starter in Rhaney,  whatever center that gets drafted and even Barrett Jones could be put into the mix."
StLouisRams,2z8r06,porkfish66,7,Mon Mar 16 17:15:42 2015 UTC,and even Barrett Jones could be put into the mix.   I'm not convinced that Barrett Jones actually exists.
StLouisRams,2z8r06,helpimnaked,4,Mon Mar 16 23:27:16 2015 UTC,"Seriously, where the fuck is he?"
StLouisRams,2z8r06,porkfish66,7,Mon Mar 16 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"My best guess is we got skipped in the 4th round of the 2013 draft, and Snead failed to notice. So he and the commissioner got together and made up an imaginary player to cover their fuckup."
StLouisRams,2z8r06,ITameFatGirls,2,Mon Mar 16 23:56:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm with you on TJ Clemmings, highest ceiling out of all the OL, the fact he's this good playing the position for only 2 years is remarkable.  Collins is right behind him.  2nd round I like AJ Cann or Cam Erving, might have to trade up a little bit."
StLouisRams,2z8r06,senators75,3,Mon Mar 16 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"I would love to get AJ Cann or see if DGB slides to second round. Looking at the roster too, I would love to Barrett Jones get a shot as a starter this year."
StLouisRams,2z8r06,lakerfan91,2,Mon Mar 16 17:17:34 2015 UTC,Cam Erving would be awesome in the 2nd I think.  Was dominant at FSU as a C for most of the year.
StLouisRams,2z8r06,superspamtastic,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:00:05 2015 UTC,I'm hoping we go with someone more polished as a pass blocker.
StLouisRams,2z87iv,TheSwampDweller,13,Mon Mar 16 13:00:22 2015 UTC,"The Rams wanted to rework it for this season, not give him an extension. That's the difference I think."
StLouisRams,2z87iv,SayHeyRay,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:48:56 2015 UTC,Why dident he?
StLouisRams,2z87iv,SayHeyRay,9,Mon Mar 16 13:49:56 2015 UTC,"Why didn't he rework it? I've read it's because he didn't want to get traded, and that would have made him easier to trade, so he didn't want to take a pay cut (even if it was a restructuring that included incentives that could have given him MORE money in the end) and then get traded too.   If you mean why didn't the Rams extend him, it's all about the injuries."
StLouisRams,2z87iv,partyeh,4,Mon Mar 16 13:52:06 2015 UTC,Ahh that is what i was looking for. Thank You
StLouisRams,2z87iv,TenAC,6,Mon Mar 16 13:53:34 2015 UTC,"I also read that the Rams were asking him to take a paycut by half his money, and that ended up being too much for him to take."
StLouisRams,2z87iv,hack5amurai,2,Mon Mar 16 14:24:22 2015 UTC,WOW
StLouisRams,2z87iv,Cloud324,4,Mon Mar 16 14:26:28 2015 UTC,"A paycut yes, but replaced partially with incentives. Probably not all the way back to his current contract though."
StLouisRams,2z87iv,Zoloir,7,Mon Mar 16 18:14:56 2015 UTC,From what I've read Bradford has known about leaving for over a month now so I doubt there were even talks.
StLouisRams,2z87iv,haamm,2,Mon Mar 16 13:32:09 2015 UTC,I mean before this month.
StLouisRams,2z87iv,ThomJonson,4,Mon Mar 16 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"I think the answer your looking for is that before Sam went down with the ACL tears, the Rams wanted to sign Bradford to an extension to rework the money on his contract and get him on a cheaper annual payout.  Bradford, meanwhile, didn't want an extension at the time because he wanted to bet on himself having a career year and sign an extension in the off season.  That would mean he could have gotten more money from the extension.  Unfortunately, he missed the next season and a half and got traded.  Now, and this is just my opinion, he wants to sign any extension he can at a somewhat competitive rate because he knows if he has another serious ACL injury, it will probably mean the end of his career."
StLouisRams,2z87iv,bretris,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:10:24 2015 UTC,"Can they not put clauses in there about injury though? Like, sure, here's an extension, but if you go down then the last year(s) are nullified."
StLouisRams,2z87iv,sjphilsphan,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:03:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah it all matters how they structure the guaranteed money/bonus. If it's front loaded in the first two or so years, then in the event of an injury they could cut him relatively easily"
StLouisRams,2z87iv,Boonslick,3,Mon Mar 23 23:25:09 2015 UTC,"I think it was all about cash and doing what was in his best interest.   With his injury history, any form of extension would have brought him back at a lower price point because he hasn't had a real opportunity to show that he has improved or even had the chance to stay on the field due to some horrendously porous olines and a constant rotation in OCs and head coaches he's had in stl.   Assuming this off season doesn't backfire on Chip Kelley, he's probably not going anywhere anytime soon and that has to be appealing to Bradford.   To summarize why I think Bradford is looking to deal now in philly:  1) No trade clause - Sam is getting a great opportunity with the Eagles and I believe that they are an ideal fit. I can't see him being too excited about being traded to the likes of Nashville as it would be ""more of the same"" when compared to his time in stl.   2) longevity - Bradford knows this year is his best shot to succeed and if he gets another season ending injury this year in philly his career almost has to be over. Of course he's going to want an extended contract just so he has more assure income.   3) Quality of team - playing for a playoff caliber team is something SB hasn't had a chance to do in stl. If he wants to win and cement his legacy, insuring that he will stay with a team that is poised to win now is definitely best for his career."
StLouisRams,2z87iv,BrawndoTTM,2,Mon Mar 16 15:19:40 2015 UTC,I read somewhere that he'll take a new contract with a small-ish paycut from the Eagles if they put a no-trade clause in there. (similar to Peyton's new contract in Denver)  The Rams were obviously not willing to insert that no-trade clause.
StLouisRams,2z87iv,big_fig,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:02:16 2015 UTC,We wanted him to re-work his contract to make it a prove you are healthy deal. He didn't so we traded him
StLouisRams,2z6ges,FaulktheBlueRedbird,25,Mon Mar 16 00:16:15 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Playoffs or bust.
StLouisRams,2z6ges,nic1244,18,Mon Mar 16 00:30:30 2015 UTC,"Dude I definitely wouldn't fire Fisher over a 9-6 miss at the playoffs. We are still really, really young. I think our ""peak"" would be two more years.   But with a relatively healthy team and Nick Foles for 16 games doesn't warrant anything less."
StLouisRams,2z6ges,Chuy_3,20,Mon Mar 16 00:40:37 2015 UTC,I'm guessing we don't play the 16th game or..?
StLouisRams,2z6ges,porkfish66,8,Mon Mar 16 02:13:41 2015 UTC,"Well I was definitely taking into account a season ending street fight between us and the Seahawks at the end of the year in Seattle. I mean if we qualify for the playoffs we would have to pick up guys from the practice squad, ans the sheer scandal of it all might put our season to bed considering it would be the first legitimate street fight in professional sports history. I'm talking some real shit. Anything goes. I'm talking Anchorman style minus the humor.   Foles - ""Britt... where'd you get the hand grenade?""  Britt - ""Don't no man shit was in Tavon's locker."""
StLouisRams,2z6ges,nic1244,2,Mon Mar 16 03:08:12 2015 UTC,Nice recovery.
StLouisRams,2z6ges,cariboustew28,5,Mon Mar 16 03:13:28 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. By ""playoffs or bust"", I just meant that I really think we can make a run at the playoffs with a healthy, competent QB, and this is the year we should seriously make that run.  I would be ecstatic if the Rams would just win a few of those games that we seem to always lose (i.e. Cowboys last year)."
StLouisRams,2z6ges,servvits_ban_boner,5,Mon Mar 16 00:50:23 2015 UTC,"(i.e. Cowboys last year)   And the Eagles game, first 49ers game, first Cardinals game... Chargers game..."
StLouisRams,2z6ges,Mace_Windu_is_Black,4,Mon Mar 16 03:39:29 2015 UTC,I would just say good season or bust.  In our division 10-6 could leave us out of the playoffs.  Just no more time for 6-10 or 7-9 garbage.
StLouisRams,2z6ges,JiveTurkey92,11,Mon Mar 16 03:05:23 2015 UTC,"I do believe that this year we will see the best football played by a Rams team in over 10 years. However baring a complete collapse in all phases, even if they missed the playoffs I would not be for getting rid of Fisher. Him and Les Snead have brought a culture to this team, one that does not like to accept failure. So let's see what we got this season! I know I can't wait!"
StLouisRams,2z6ges,cariboustew28,-3,Mon Mar 16 01:24:26 2015 UTC,"So far it seems Fisher has been pushing mediocrity if anything. He absolutely needs to go if we don't make the playoffs. This team has shown they can compete, we need to play top level every week, and if we can't do it, then fisher has to go. A coach is the biggest piece to a championship squad. We have playoff level talent, we need that coach. Our window is approaching, we can't screw it up."
StLouisRams,2z6ges,bretris,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:26:58 2015 UTC,Eh... we were really at the bottom of the talent barrel in 2012 when he came in. It's only been three seasons and we're in a division with the Cardinals and Seahawks. I mean we could go 10-6 and miss the playoffs.   A winning season would be enough for me.
StLouisRams,2z6ges,bretris,6,Tue Mar 17 19:55:22 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at this season as kind of the first year of a three-year window. This year we make the playoffs, next we should expect NFCCG/SB appearance, then the third year is our best chance to win the whole damn thing.  Here's a breakdown of what I would say is our ""soft"" core of players' years of experience:  7 years: Chris Long  6 years: Kenny Britt, Jared Cook, James Laurinaitis  5 years: Akeem Ayers  4 years: Joe Barksdale, Nick Foles, Robert Quinn  3 years: Mark Barron, Michael Brockers, Johnny Hekker, Janoris Jenkins, Trumaine Johnson, Rodney McLeod, Brian Quick, Greg Zuerlein  2 years: Tavon Austin, Stedman Bailey, Barrett Jones, TJ McDonald, Alec Ogletree, Zac Stacy  1 year: Aaron Donald, EJ Gaines, Tre Mason, Greg Robinson  Seeing that big group of guys with 1-3 years of experience move through to 3-5 years of knowledge and getting to know the playbook even better (remember it's a new offense for Foles) I only see as beneficial. With the right draft this year to set our team up for the next two season I really see us as a contender with an outstanding defence and an offense that is above average but can put teams away early. The four most experienced guys on this list I feel are great leaders for this team and culture (Cook might be debatable).  I feel like I say this every year from like February-August but I'm really starting to like our team and I have a lot of hope for what's to come."
StLouisRams,2z6ges,price-iz-right,8,Mon Mar 16 03:35:04 2015 UTC,"I'll reserve my judgement until after the draft.  But I don't think next season is make-or-break. Foles and Fisher need time and the last thing this young team needs is more pressure to win.  Also, it depends if the team moves to L.A. or not. They might want to keep some consistency over that period and will probably not switch head coaches. (obviously it would suck if the rams moved)"
StLouisRams,2z6ges,ITameFatGirls,5,Mon Mar 16 00:48:20 2015 UTC,"the last thing this young team needs is more pressure to win.    Dude this the NFL, not a middle school league where everyone gets a trophy at the end of the season. They can feel some pressure to win games."
StLouisRams,2z6ges,Areyoumyfriend,0,Mon Mar 16 00:54:32 2015 UTC,"In New Orleans it was super bowl or bust last season and look what happened.  I'm not saying these guys should totally chill out, but they should take it one game at a time and not have to worry about a deep playoff run in March."
StLouisRams,2z6ges,jordanstationcnru,2,Mon Mar 16 01:16:37 2015 UTC,"Penalties will never go away on a Fisher team, let's accept that first and foremost  Also you are selling our situation last year short. You compare the QB woes of the 2013 season and none of the other factors into our ""regression""  Williams got a full season last year, the first half of the season our players were still adjusting to the defensive scheme. Then we made the Barron move to solidify our new defense. Towards the end of the 2014 season I'd call our defense anything BUT a regression.  The SAME THING is going to happen with our offense so don't get your hopes up. For the 3rd year in a row our offense will have to adjust to yet another QB. I'm loving the Foles move, but he is going to need time to adjust to players and scheme. Our offense is going to need time to adjust to Foles and scheme.   Everyone forgets that Schotty is a big ""?"" This season. Just how much of those dumbass calls last year were his fault? How will our offense perform under a new and ""simple"" offense scheme? Was Tavon used correctly? Would a simpler scheme make our run game better or worse? Would a simpler scheme make our O line better or worse?  It's much more complicated than you're painting and I'm not sold yet, however I feel your pain  We all want our team to make it to the playoffs and we are ALL tired of fucking losing winnable games these past few years, but what I feel this team needs overall is consistency. We need a fucking QB for more than one season. We need competent coordinators for more than one season. Consistency is what is going to help this young and maturing team right now IMO."

StLouisRams,2z4t5x,bretris,13,Sun Mar 15 16:22:41 2015 UTC,It would be a blunder not to. He gives you everything you expect from a traditional run stuffing DT. He would be a starter on any team he went to that runs a 4-3 and probably most 3-4 teams
StLouisRams,2z4t5x,frankoftank,9,Sun Mar 15 16:46:17 2015 UTC,No reason we shouldn't. He's a good run stuffer for a 4-3. We don't have anybody to replace him currently on the roster so it would cost us as much or more money than his 5th year option or it'd take a 1st round pick to replace him.
StLouisRams,2z4t5x,bozo7337,3,Sun Mar 15 16:26:06 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't we?
StLouisRams,2z4t5x,Yji,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:00:27 2015 UTC,His fifth year option? He's entering his fourth year. Is that a typo or are we already guaranteeing the fifth year? That wouldn't make any sense.

We've got a ton of youth in our secondary just like our receivers. I think if we picked up a veteran like we did for our receivers with Britt, it could go a long way. I think our secondary is gonna be fine, but it wouldn't hurt to grab somebody else, I agree."
StLouisRams,2z4e4l,mrcolter51,11,Sun Mar 15 14:07:14 2015 UTC,Gaines was awesome I'm very excited for his second year. Everyone forgets about Trumaine as well. He plays very well. I don't think any of our guys are true shutdown guys but with our pass rush they are more than capable.
StLouisRams,2z4e4l,Sherwood_Ashe,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:10:22 2015 UTC,"Well we had a veteran in Cortland Finnegan but he was dogshit. I'm not too worried about our secondary. Are they great? No. But they are good enough to get the job done, especially with our pass rush. If Joyner and gaines improve in their second year and Tru Johnson fixes whatever the hell was wrong with him last year, we'll have a solid secondary."

StLouisRams,2z4e4l,_csbass,2,Sun Mar 15 22:00:36 2015 UTC,I'd rather build through the draft than sell the farm for a player.
StLouisRams,2z4e4l,alderaan_never4get,7,Sun Mar 15 22:02:16 2015 UTC,I think everyone expects too much here. Shut down corners don't grow on trees. Over the last few drafts name all of the shut down corners that have come out. The best corner out of last years draft is on our team with a 6th round pick. The year before the Jets took Miliner as the top guy and he wasn't very good as a CB1. Same goes with Claiborne etc etc. It's a crapshoot and ours are still developing. Janoris has been pretty good honestly and he probably hasn't given up any more TD's then Patrick Peterson has since he's been drafted (21) and Peterson was considered a top dude until this year. Jenkins gets burned occasionally and occasionally makes a huge play. Trumaine Johnson is getting better if he can stay on the field and develop. Joyner didn't look great last year but he was an undersized rookie playing out of position quite a bit and having to adjust he'll get better. Them as a whole was our strength for the first six weeks when the pass rush couldn't rush.
StLouisRams,2z4e4l,the_logistician,5,Sun Mar 15 16:38:53 2015 UTC,You can always use more help in the secondary but I wouldn't say I'm worried about it.  Remember a few years ago when (iirc) we were signing street free agents during the season because so many DBs got injured?  That's when I was worried.    And I must say that my trust in Snead has really gone up.  What a bold set of moves he's made!  On paper at least it all looks good.  I think he's showing himself to be a very good GM and that comforts me.  If the secondary is a weakness I trust that he'll find a way to strengthen it.
StLouisRams,2z4e4l,servvits_ban_boner,3,Sun Mar 15 15:35:12 2015 UTC,"I think we have good players already in place. I honestly believe Gaines will be a shutdown corner. TJ is a prototype SS, and will continue to improve in coverage. Jenoris will gamble, so Williams either needs to adjust for that or Tru will see more time. Then we have Rodney who has improved every year. He is a solid perfectly average FS. Joyner is a great slot corner and blitzer, and can play FS in a pinch.

StLouisRams,2z4e4l,ragtop1989,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:28:18 2015 UTC,I like Barron too. I think he was worth the trade. I just don't think he played enough last season to impress everyone.
StLouisRams,2z53ap,ismizz,7,Sun Mar 15 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"We'll see. I have a weird feeling they're keeping him. Regardless, Bradford's new team in 2015 will be my ""second"" team. Wish him nothing but the best."
StLouisRams,2z53ap,FaulktheBlueRedbird,2,Mon Mar 16 00:18:45 2015 UTC,"As an Eagles fan  have consented that Bradford is the starter. They would not have given the extra second round pick if he was not going to be a starter. Also, I am guessing DeMarco Murray would not be happy if his college roommate was not the QB."
StLouisRams,2z53ap,joecity856,1 point,Mon Mar 16 12:41:51 2015 UTC,"Also, I am guessing DeMarco Murray would not be happy if his college roommate was not the QB.    Yeah, imagine that.  As far as we know, Philadelphia was not even in the running (no pun intended) to get Murray until Bradford came along and recruited him.  If they trade Bradford now Murray might be sitting there thinking why the hell did I come to Philly?  He was a gift that fell into Chip Kelly's lap."
StLouisRams,2z53ap,DeniseDeNephew,3,Tue Mar 17 07:57:24 2015 UTC,"If the Eagles wanted to, they could trade this year's first, next year's first plus Bradford and pick up Mariota. The Eagles wouldn't be losing a butt load of first round picks to move up and they have the security of our 3 round pick as a safety blanket."
StLouisRams,2z53ap,corbilm,7,Sun Mar 15 20:55:46 2015 UTC,"If this happened, the Eagles would be have given up the following to get Mariota: Nick Foles, Sam Bradford, 4th Round Pick (2015), First Round Pick (2015), First Round Pick (2016), and a Second Round Pick (2016).  Mariota is not worth it."
StLouisRams,2z53ap,tjs2215,0,Sun Mar 15 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they would have to use their third round pick on it but you're also failing to mention they would receive a 3 round pick, while they're gaining their franchise QB. Plus they still have other picks they could be swapping, I'm just playjng he devil's advocate... Don't get on a soap box."
StLouisRams,2z53ap,corbilm,2,Mon Mar 16 00:05:49 2015 UTC,Eagles only get Rams 3rd rounder is Bradford is re injured. They get a 4th rounder if he plays less than 50% of the offensive snaps (which I'm not sure how that plays out if Eagles traded him).  I'm not on a soapbox. Just writing the facts.
StLouisRams,2z53ap,tjs2215,2,Mon Mar 16 00:15:15 2015 UTC,"The facts don't state that tho, they state that ""if bradford doesn't start for 40% of the season for the Eagles then they get a 3rd."

StLouisRams,2z2vzj,jrose6717,3,Sun Mar 15 01:37:33 2015 UTC,I agree.  As much as I like Chris Long I think Matt Ryan would have had a much larger impact on the team's record from 2008 to now.

StLouisRams,2z38eb,Yji,3,Sun Mar 15 03:44:20 2015 UTC,Brockers Fairley rotation is most likely.
StLouisRams,2z38eb,Quasimdo,2,Sun Mar 15 04:35:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think its going to be pretty evenly split between those two, winner gets a new contract next year and loser hits FA."

StLouisRams,2z38eb,rloftis6,2,Sun Mar 15 13:27:00 2015 UTC,"Fisher and Wauffle are fans of using a rotation with everybody. None of them play every snap in fact Quinn took about 2/3 of snaps last year.    http://www.rosterresource.com/nfl-st-louis-rams-snap-counts/    As you can see from that link above. A fair assumption would be that Fairley gets Langfords snap count. Quinn and Long get rotated out by Sims, Hayes and Westbrook. Brockers and Donald will be rotated out by Fairley and a DT that hasn't been added yet if Carrington isn't resigned. One thing they're known to do a lot though it might change this year is use 4 DE on obvious passing downs. It's possible they could go with Quinn, Donald, Fairley and Long though in the past we've seen Quinn, Sims, Hayes and Long on thirds and long (like 3rd and 10+). They all get rotated and kept fresh I think just at a quick glance at the list the most any of the DLine played in one game was Donald played 60 of 78 snaps one game 77% of the snaps."

StLouisRams,2yxxl9,Bskrilla,9,Fri Mar 13 20:01:19 2015 UTC,He's really only a #2 if you're only looking at receiving yards. He is in on roughly the same % of snaps as Cook and is a very capable blocker.    It's clear that the Rams weren't the only team to value him highly.

I wasn't expecting a Rodgers/Manning/Brady type player, nor was I expecting someone who can maintain 27-2 consistently. A solid starting-caliber QB who is at or above the Dalton line and not raping our cap is more than fine by me. I know wins are a team stat, but I really like Foles 14-4 record over the past 2 seasons. That's really something, and I think you pit it best by saying he's a winner. While I strongly suspect a pre-draft trade is looming for you guys, if Chip actually does decide to go with Bradford, I think you'll like him. He's a very solid QB if he can stay healthy. Great accuracy and doesn't make stupid mistakes. He's WAY better than his stats show because our receivers dropped a ton of passes and he had no protection. As long as your line holds strong he should do well."

StLouisRams,2yy9s9,crewdoughty,11,Sat Mar 14 03:47:41 2015 UTC,I just want a starting QB with 2 knees
StLouisRams,2yy9s9,NewBroPewPew,4,Fri Mar 13 22:56:39 2015 UTC,or three!
StLouisRams,2yy9s9,clandestinewarrior,2,Sat Mar 14 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"Foles is a good QB, certainly folks in Philly are not overjoyed with the trade. He's above average I think"
StLouisRams,2yy9s9,shahz89,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"Depends who you talk to. I would say most of us didn't believe in him as our franchise QB. Hes an slightly above average as a QB. He had a great 2013, but he regressed significantly last season. He made very poor decisions, often repeating the same mistakes over the course of several games, played with poor mechanics including his tendancy to throw off his back foot. He did take a lot of tough shots but as the season wore on he became a bit skiddish in the pocket. He would start prematurly scrambling out of the pocket when there was not any pressure present, not letting the plays develop. To his credit, we were 5-2 with him as a starter (Sanchez won the Texans game so he isn't 6-2), but I think we won a lot of those in spite of Foles. We had the top special teams unit in the league and even our defense made plays and returned a lot of TD's.  With Foles you get a hard working QB who is a good leader, but he needs a lot of talent around him to be anything special."
StLouisRams,2yy9s9,clandestinewarrior,1 point,Sun Mar 15 23:17:54 2015 UTC,Opinions were divided for sure. He is not an obviously bad QB. I agree with your last sentence.
StLouisRams,2yy9s9,Psychart5150,1 point,Mon Mar 16 10:45:10 2015 UTC,"As an Eagles and huge foles fan, I disagree with some of what he said. It's going to take a lot of developing for him to be a top 5 qb, he has a lot of foot work issues, but I think what makes him a great qb is what you hope your qb has.  He is tough im the pocket, I forgot what game it was this year where he was getting hit just about every snap and he stood in here and made the throws, it was amazing to watch. He also is a guy that doesn't fold under pressure, when he left the field against the saints two years back in the playoffs we had the lead.  Overall get a line to defend him and continue to develop him and you guys got a great one"
StLouisRams,2yy9s9,Dristone,1 point,Sat Mar 14 02:14:53 2015 UTC,"It was the skins game. He got pounded that game where he was visibly wincing on the ground, but he kept getting back up and brought us back to a win. Foles has those intangibles that you can't really coach which is why I love him. He doesn't really get rattled and can bounce back from mistakes really well. He's got that cool calm demeanor that you want in a QB especially if you're behind late in games. Here's to hoping he does very well with you guys!"
StLouisRams,2yy9s9,Samu-ELBradford,-1,Sat Mar 14 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"all rams need to know is no matter how bad foles might perform, he will never be worse than any of the crap you have on your roster now.  I don't know what to expect from foles after going from a qb friendly offense to jeff fischers offense and a tough defensive division. Its honestly a wait and see for both sides of the trade"
StLouisRams,2yy9s9,NewBroPewPew,-2,Sat Mar 14 15:29:23 2015 UTC,At least you spelled Summary right..................................
StLouisRams,2yx98k,Shonuff88,17,Fri Mar 13 16:23:48 2015 UTC,"I love it. If he can play to his potential it will just make the line even scarier. If he shows up and plays mediocre like Lions fans seem to think he has played, it still doesn't hurt us that badly."
StLouisRams,2yx98k,yohansmash,7,Fri Mar 13 16:31:03 2015 UTC,Its not that he always played mediocre. The issue is that he took plays off and was wildly inconsistent before his contract year. Before he got injured he was actually playing pretty well.   E: I think this is actually a pretty good contract. I think he'd go Hanesworth on anyone who signed him to a longer contract
StLouisRams,2yx98k,Perry87,2,Fri Mar 13 17:18:22 2015 UTC,i don't know why lions fans were down on him.  maybe the injuries or maybe they just expected too much when they have a standout like suh next to him?
StLouisRams,2yx98k,hb_alien,2,Fri Mar 13 17:19:38 2015 UTC,High draft pick. Injured a lot. Inconsistent when on the field
StLouisRams,2yx98k,Perry87,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"Motivation issues too. Always struggled with his weight. He'd be extremely disruptive for like a few plays in a row and then basically invisible for big chunks of the games (or big chunks of the season).   Conditioning was poor too, he would play like 60-65ish% of the snaps per game (compared to Suh, who admittedly is a beast, who would play 90-95%).   He had to be demoted by Caldwell to the bench earlier this year, despite being in a contract year, before he worked up the motivation to actually do something."
StLouisRams,2yx98k,TheThirdLevel,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:31:35 2015 UTC,"Well maybe you should go watch some tape then. We got to watch him for 4 seasons. He's lazy, inconsistent, has off-field issues, and very injury prone.  Yeah he is sometimes a dominating player but 80% of the time he's unnoticeable because he's taking plays off, not trying, or sitting on the bench gassed because of his poor conditioning/weight issues  I hope he can revitalize his career in st Louis. Don't get your hopes up tho"

StLouisRams,2z2b9t,BrawndoTTM,5,Sat Mar 14 22:30:38 2015 UTC,Not worth the cap space. Tre and Cunningham are a very good 1-2 combo. We have actual holes to fill and there's absolutely no need in losing high draft picks over a relative strength.
StLouisRams,2z2b9t,bwc_28,2,Sat Mar 14 22:35:17 2015 UTC,No I'm all for second chances but not for these two. I also highly doubt the viking trade Peterson without asking for at least a 1st round pick anyways.

StLouisRams,2z2b9t,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:54:13 2015 UTC,Why? We have limited cap space first of all and have much higher priorities. Secondly Rice isn't worth it and APete will command more money than we have and we don't need to spend the draft captial to get him. Also do the Rams need any more potential negative press with their home crowd? Management isn't likely to give people around St Louis another reason to not go to games. Then there's the fact as you mention we really don't need a RB.

StLouisRams,2yx0q2,BrawndoTTM,2,Fri Mar 13 15:59:17 2015 UTC,He was projected to go in the second. No idea why he fell so far but what a steal!
StLouisRams,2yx0q2,writh3n,3,Fri Mar 13 17:45:32 2015 UTC,because he wasn't tall enough I believe.  Those people are foolish.  It isn't like the rams drafted the tiniest receiver possible.

StLouisRams,2yx0q2,ClitorisNigga,7,Fri Mar 13 15:55:28 2015 UTC,Are these performance bonuses decided before signing their contract?
StLouisRams,2yx0q2,helpimnaked,4,Fri Mar 13 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"Don't take this as truth but as far as I know, veterans regularly have incentives in their contracts such as reaching certain statistical numbers or certain amount of games. For rookies like EJ I am sure these incentives are written into every rookie contract the same way. If I had to guess, the incentives are likely based on playing time first, and statistics second."
StLouisRams,2yx0q2,TheSmart1,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:42:34 2015 UTC,"The invective aren't expressly written in their contracts, they are part of the new CBA. As part of the negotiations that capped rookie contracts to a certain amount, the Union insisted on performance incentives for rookies who ""outplayed"" their contract. The amounts are determined mostly by playing time, I believe."
StLouisRams,2yx0q2,FaulktheBlueRedbird,5,Fri Mar 13 22:25:27 2015 UTC,I really really hope that Gaines only continues to improve and eventually becomes top tier. I love it when players go in the sixth or seventh rounds and become Pro Bowlers

StLouisRams,2yxjsg,kiniska,2,Fri Mar 13 19:49:09 2015 UTC,"Very.  Obviously the defense is what I'm most excited for.  In a new scheme under Gregg Williams they started slow last season but once it ""clicked"", they were a force.   I'd expect the trend to continue.  A dominant pass rush will make our secondary look better than they actually are, 50+ sacks. (highly doubt we go 0 sacks in the first 5? games again)  I would like a true FS next to TJ.  Offense is just as intriguing, new QB, new coordinator, new line, lot of question marks.  I trust Snead and Fisher to fill out the OLine nicely though."
StLouisRams,2yxjsg,ITameFatGirls,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:35:53 2015 UTC,You guys have every right to be excited for next season.  Rams are looking hella lethal.  Sometimes it's shitty being a part of the NFC Best.

StLouisRams,2yxjsg,IAmAWitness,2,Sat Mar 14 08:30:20 2015 UTC,"It was more of a belief at the start of every season ""If Bradford stays healthy.. We could be 2spooky4u"" now we can stop wondering and know. I think if Bradford stays healthy(see no more of that IF) he could light it up on the Eagles. I hope he does but another injury and he could have set us back a couple years. I don't even know if we have to draft a QB now. Especially not in the top of the draft at least and we can focus and fill other needs, along with the second rounder we get next year it was a great trade for us."
StLouisRams,2yxjsg,DabDastic,0,Sat Mar 14 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"I think we are still in the same situation of needing to draft our franchise QB, and there is less of a chance in finding one in what we already have."

StLouisRams,2ywxjf,lakerfan91,16,Fri Mar 13 14:49:27 2015 UTC,I guess he's a good replacement for Langford
StLouisRams,2ywxjf,Ihateunerds,2,Fri Mar 13 14:49:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm kinda mixed on this. That's a lot of money for a rotational guy when we have bigger needs to fill on offensive line.  But depth is good and Jesus that's one scary line.
StLouisRams,2ywxjf,DeniseDeNephew,7,Sat Mar 14 03:10:41 2015 UTC,"I hope he can keep his weight in check.  Wow, what an offseason it has been!  And there's so much more to go.   Nobody knows how our new guys will work out but I'm on board and excited about all the changes so far."
StLouisRams,2ywxjf,New_DudeToo,5,Fri Mar 13 15:09:52 2015 UTC,Heck it won't even matter that much. He will get nothing but 1 on 1 blocking. Having Fairley be the 4th best DL on the team is going to make for something very special
StLouisRams,2ywxjf,xKeyNin,5,Fri Mar 13 15:14:35 2015 UTC,That's the most amazing part. Nick Fairley is probably the 4th best defensive lineman on the team. Wow.

Hes quite massive but still has incredible burst and quickness for his size (best asset) while still being able to hold down the line and control gaps.  He hasn't reached his full potential coming out of Auburn.  Highly regarded coming out it was kind of a shock he ""fell"" to #13.  Big big fan of this signing if it happens, assuming we didn't over spend.  I'd expect him in on passing situations replacing Brockers.  He seems to play well even when he's over weight, but I think the bigger issue with that is he seems to get small injuries often (nothing major), prolly due to being out of shape.  Missed time in 11', 12', and 14'.  Hopefully he reaches his full potential in horns."

StLouisRams,2yxbxq,SaucemanXL,15,Fri Mar 13 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"Stop, I can only get so erect!"
StLouisRams,2yxbxq,The_helpful_idiot,2,Fri Mar 13 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"I think the draft is pretty deep with guards/center, need to make sure RT is taken care of."
StLouisRams,2yxbxq,mlasn,6,Fri Mar 13 18:54:28 2015 UTC,"I believe, with signing Fairley/Ayers and hopefully Britt, that we will be effectively unable to nab both with our cap space. I like to think they have a plan for retaining Britt and Barksdale."
StLouisRams,2yxbxq,The_Wayward,6,Fri Mar 13 17:28:47 2015 UTC,We could sign Britt and back load his contract.
StLouisRams,2yxbxq,amanoob,2,Fri Mar 13 17:45:02 2015 UTC,Rather not back load too much right now. We may be trying to lock up Foles long term next year if all goes well.
StLouisRams,2yxbxq,The_Wayward,3,Fri Mar 13 17:54:44 2015 UTC,"We are pretty good cap wise because I think both JL and Chris Long will have to be restructured or both released.  They take up over 20 million next season, their production has taken a dip.  We can cut them both if we have to with little dead money, lot of savings.    Same with Cook, I'd expect a huge season for him if he wants to make over 8 million dollars next year, if not he's gone."
StLouisRams,2yxbxq,ITameFatGirls,1 point,Fri Mar 13 20:55:33 2015 UTC,"Long was hurt last year, I think we'll see him have a resurgence this year and hopefully we'll keep him around. JL55 I wouldn't mind seeing let go. Ogeltree could probably kick to ILB or we draft one early next season.   On Cook, I wouldn't mind getting rid of him at all. He may have led the team in receiving, but I think we paid Kendricks so much because his role will be steadily expanded until he can start. Then we'll bring someone else in to play that other side in 12 personnel sets."
StLouisRams,2yxbxq,The_Wayward,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:56:50 2015 UTC,Cap increases every year so I think it night be smart to back load most contacts at the cost of putting guaranteed money early.
StLouisRams,2yxbxq,amanoob,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"Fair point. If it keeps going up $10 million a year, that certainly helps. Contracts get more expensive with more cap room as well."
StLouisRams,2yxbxq,The_Wayward,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:21:16 2015 UTC,Yup that's why teams tend to lock in players they intend to keep long term.

If Bradford got injured again or had a poor year he was more than likely gone, and we wouldn't have got much for him. But instead they took the risk of bringing in a lesser but more durable quarterback so we can have a steadier rise and focus on other pieces to improve."
StLouisRams,2yyczd,To3z,13,Fri Mar 13 21:51:24 2015 UTC,"We needed that cap space to address some key areas, plus I think personally that while Bradford still has the higher ceiling, the margin between his and Foles' isn't as big as the author is saying."

Still don't know how to feel, bradfords definitely got potential but only if he can stay healthy and that's a big if. I was a proponent for not trading for Mariota and rolling with Foles."
StLouisRams,2yyczd,Dristone,9,Sat Mar 14 18:19:38 2015 UTC,The rest of the league had essentially written Bradford off as a bust but suddenly because Chip traded for him he's a Superbowl QB?  Lol.  He failed because he had no weapons in StL?  Whi exactly is he going to be throwing to in Philly?  Riley Cooper?  Josh Huff?    Give me a break.  I hope for Sam's sake that he does turn his career around but can we stop treating Chip Kelly like such a personnel genius?
StLouisRams,2yyczd,ismizz,0,Sat Mar 14 13:26:35 2015 UTC,"Matthews is a good WR. Huff can be a very good WR. And Cooper...umm...Yeah I got nothing but we are going to draft another one probably. Plus we have Sproles, Demarco, Ertz and Celek."
StLouisRams,2yyczd,TheTrueEaglesFan,13,Mon Mar 16 03:37:15 2015 UTC,"That author is a bit of a patronizing asshole and seems to be looking at the trade as simply Foles vs. Bradford. Of course Bradford is the better player when he's healthy, but there were others reasons why the Rams made the trade."

StLouisRams,2yy1gm,TotesNotBatman,6,Fri Mar 13 20:02:27 2015 UTC,"According to Over The Cap, not factoring in Nick Fairley's contract, we are sitting at $122,951,164. The 2015 salary cap is $143,280,000.  So before Fairley's signing, we're at $20,328,836 in space.  Edit: just read that his contract is worth $5 million (with incentives up to $8), so right now we're at $15,328,836 in cap space."

I love Kevin White, think he's a top 5 pick but to trade up from the late twenties to #10, that's a minimal return of:  Swap first  Next years first  Second round  I'd take AJ Cann and Cam Erving to solidify the middle of the line.  Next year we'd have two 1st's and two 2nds."
StLouisRams,2ywotc,ITameFatGirls,4,Fri Mar 13 13:47:06 2015 UTC,"Amari Cooper for me, especially if we've signed 2 or 3 linemen to come in and start right away."
StLouisRams,2ywotc,bozo7337,2,Fri Mar 13 14:07:47 2015 UTC,"Not a chance this will happen, at best one will be there. That said, unless Philly makes a Snyder-tier farm selling trade for Mariota, I'd like to trade down just a couple spots, so that we can still get one of Cooper/Scherff/White at the spot we trade down, while picking up an extra second or third."
StLouisRams,2ywotc,BrawndoTTM,2,Fri Mar 13 14:30:25 2015 UTC,"If we get a chance as Cooper or White I think we have to pull the trigger immediately.  That said, if this scenario really does happen(probably .001% that it does) then, if I were Snead, I would trade down no more then 2-3 spots.  I think White and Cooper are about 2nd and 3rd best players in this draft.  So if we can get one, we don't want to lose that chance."
StLouisRams,2ywotc,czah7,2,Fri Mar 13 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"If the trade is for a pick in the late 20's I'm not taking it.  We need a top 10 talent.  Cooper and Scherff are top 10 talent (so is Mariota but with the trade I think we can wait on QB). I'm still not sold on Kevin White being better than Cooper.    If it was me, I'm taking Cooper."
StLouisRams,2ywotc,washeduplegend,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:35:16 2015 UTC,"I think Cooper is more ready to come in and make an immediate impact.

StLouisRams,2ywotc,htownholditdown,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"I was actually asking this over in the Texans subreddit. What would you guys want if we wanted to trade down and take your spot at 10 to draft Cooper?  Obviously we would swap first rounders, but after that REALISTICALLY what else would you want?

I think most Pats fans liked him a lot because he had a few big plays after Mayo went down, but honestly this isn't a huge signing. He's a step up from Dunbar, but I don't see him making pro bowls any time soon. Not to mention he had surgery in both knees last summer. All that is why we got him cheap with little guaranteed money. There's a lot of upside in our defense, but he's got an average track record outside what he's done in New England."

By comparison DeAndre Hopkins, the #27 pick in the same draft, last year had 76 receptions 1210 yards and 6 touchdowns. And he did it with backup QB's more than Austin has had. Austin has struggled as a reciever and is over rated as a punt returner. He hasn't lived up to the #8 pick in the first round especially since we traded up for him."
StLouisRams,2yvn7d,bozo7337,7,Fri Mar 13 04:54:38 2015 UTC,I really wanted DeAndre. And Mike Evans. Just saying...
StLouisRams,2yvn7d,wowbagger88,1 point,Fri Mar 13 05:59:36 2015 UTC,DeAndre was one of my favorite WR's in recent drafts and we didn't even have to move up to take him. In fact we could have traded back and got him.
StLouisRams,2yvn7d,bozo7337,2,Fri Mar 13 14:06:42 2015 UTC,I wanted those two specifically. Not like I just wanted random WRs. I loved their size. I was infuriated when the Rams traded up for Tavon.
StLouisRams,2yvn7d,wowbagger88,3,Fri Mar 13 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with your analysis of him as a receiver, but he's definitely not overrated as a punt returner. The only reason his stats may not seem great as a returner is because our special teams miraculously gets penalized nearly every time he has made a big return. He is an impressive return man, mediocre receiver at this point."
StLouisRams,2yvn7d,mrcolter51,2,Fri Mar 13 16:25:04 2015 UTC,"But we had shittenheimer who had no idea how to use Tavon like WVU did. Hopefully new o-coordinator can use Tavon correctly, so he shows why he was 8th pick overall."

StLouisRams,2yvn7d,hack5amurai,2,Fri Mar 13 11:33:08 2015 UTC,Same with DeAndre he's had Schaub and Fitzpatrick as the best QB's he's caught passes from. They're right on par with Shaun Hill. And FYI Austin played 7 games with Bradford.
StLouisRams,2yvn7d,bozo7337,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"I'd take either of those over hill,  then again I'd take Hopkins over tavon.  My bad on Bradford and Tay playing together."
StLouisRams,2yvn7d,hack5amurai,5,Fri Mar 13 15:57:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely hasn't been put  in a position to succeed as a receiver.  When he does get the ball  in space, which seldomly happened with Shotty calling plays, he's almost a lock  to make one guy miss every play. The dude is electric. Given the correct opportunities I have no doubt Tavon will produce!"
StLouisRams,2yvn7d,RodHardStaff,4,Fri Mar 13 06:36:02 2015 UTC,"I like Tavon Austin, we don't utilize his skill set.  I'm just not a fan of drafting a slot WR, gadget player 8th overall.  Jury is still out on him."
StLouisRams,2yvn7d,ITameFatGirls,3,Fri Mar 13 16:11:36 2015 UTC,"And we're tired of you trying to justify that he's good. ""Look up highlights"" well shit, look up blanks highlights and they all look at least good.  You simply do not trade up for a player that only fits into a specific offense/role especially when we're not that kind of offense.  Ive seen more times than not that this sub circlejerks for Austin. And he may be good, but he's currently been no good to us in a whole season. Look at the stats, he's been a boom or bust player in games with more busts than boom.  Sorry, this is the reality of the situation. You can blame QBs, but even shitty QBs can hook up with ""good"" receivers more times than not."
StLouisRams,2yvn7d,Chuy_3,5,Fri Mar 13 17:53:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just like every other player on the team he is massively undervalued, which is why the Rams went 14-2 last year and won the Super Bowl.

StLouisRams,2ysju6,The_Wayward,5,Thu Mar 12 17:10:37 2015 UTC,If they can get him on a cheaper contract than they will be able to get Brockers on next year it makes sense. Either way they have to pay a DT in the next year.
StLouisRams,2ysju6,hack5amurai,2,Thu Mar 12 14:43:11 2015 UTC,My problem is fairley is more of a natural 3 tech.  He sure as hell ain't beating out Donald.  So what are we just going all in on pass rush?
StLouisRams,2ysju6,The_Wayward,2,Thu Mar 12 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"He is. That's my only concern, but I think they will move him between 1 and 3 tech depending on the situation. Williams and Fisher both like to move people around on the D-Line."
StLouisRams,2ysju6,hack5amurai,2,Thu Mar 12 16:29:51 2015 UTC,I would love to have him.  Just don't think he is a great replacement for brockers if we go that direction
StLouisRams,2ysju6,The_Wayward,2,Thu Mar 12 17:47:09 2015 UTC,Depends on the price tag as always. He'd be a good luxury. I don't think there is any reason he couldn't play predominately 1-tech either.
StLouisRams,2ysju6,The_Wayward,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:11:08 2015 UTC,They are similar players too. Both first round draft picks that haven't really lived up to potential. I'd say Fairley has shown more ability (especially pass rushing) than Brockers. If Nick keeps the weight off he's a better option than Brockers and only a few years older. I'd be interested to see how his knee is rehabbing though.  Edit: correction on Fairley's age.

StLouisRams,2yq87r,bnsaluki,10,Wed Mar 11 22:14:13 2015 UTC,Yesss. I was hoping some of the extra cash from the Bradford trade would go to Retaining Britt and Barksdale
StLouisRams,2yq87r,grizwald85,-14,Wed Mar 11 22:54:39 2015 UTC,Finally some good news.
StLouisRams,2yq87r,crackalac,-28,Wed Mar 11 23:28:18 2015 UTC,The train wreck of the Bradford trade is my main issue. The rest of the moves have been ok.
StLouisRams,2yq87r,crackalac,-23,Thu Mar 12 00:05:34 2015 UTC,We basically traded troy tulowitzki for David Eckstein
StLouisRams,2yq87r,crackalac,6,Thu Mar 12 00:40:08 2015 UTC,I'm not sure Eckstein and 6'6 Foles is a good comparison.
StLouisRams,2yq87r,Cloud324,-12,Thu Mar 12 00:45:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just making the comparison from a skills standpoint. Traded potential MVP type talent for safe and steady."
StLouisRams,2yq87r,crackalac,17,Thu Mar 12 00:51:02 2015 UTC,David Eckstein was a World Series MVP if you remember.  ;)
StLouisRams,2yq87r,Cloud324,4,Thu Mar 12 00:52:50 2015 UTC,Potential is a big word when the dude hasn't played a regular season game since the first half of the 2013 season. Yeah he could be good but we got someone who doesn't tear his ACL walking now though
StLouisRams,2yq87r,DabDastic,2,Thu Mar 12 00:56:29 2015 UTC,"If you want to compare Bradford to Tulo, despite the disparity in stats, that's fine.  Tulo is never healthy and the Rockies are absolutely atrocious whenever he is hurt. At this point, I'll take the steady, consistent guy. Assuming that's what Foles is."
StLouisRams,2yq87r,Sinisterminister77,-10,Thu Mar 12 01:01:07 2015 UTC,I don't see any of the injuries as predictive. The ACL was the medical staff's fault the second time around. No way he should have been cleared yet.
StLouisRams,2yq87r,crackalac,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:14:59 2015 UTC,He's been injury prone thought college. As good as he could be Id rather another team deal with him. I wish him the best of luck and hopes he reaches his potential but I'm extremely happy about Foles
StLouisRams,2yq87r,DabDastic,7,Thu Mar 12 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"Train wreck?  I think Bradford has more potential than Foles, but in every other aspect, Foles is a better piece at a much better value.  Also, we got the better end of the draft pick swap.  Other than that, we've cut the players that have already been replaced with younger, cheaper counterparts.  I think this offseason has been better than expected."
StLouisRams,2yq87r,Cloud324,-6,Thu Mar 12 02:17:57 2015 UTC,I dunno. I guess I view it as trading a potential pro bowler for a likely backup.
StLouisRams,2yq87r,crackalac,7,Thu Mar 12 04:04:06 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I think Bradford has more potential, he was a 1st overall pick after all.  But, you have to consider salary and health, both of which Bradford negatively affected the team with.  I wasn't a huge Foles fan, but he's no scrub.  He's got a solid track record and been a pro bowl MVP for what that's worth.  Just because he wasn't wasn't a 1st round QB, doesn't mean he's a career backup."
StLouisRams,2yq87r,Cloud324,5,Thu Mar 12 00:48:56 2015 UTC,I'm of the opinion that we've been killing it so far.
StLouisRams,2yq87r,helpimnaked,-12,Thu Mar 12 00:51:33 2015 UTC,I'd feel better if yesterday didn't happen.
StLouisRams,2yq87r,crackalac,8,Thu Mar 12 00:57:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to say you're in the minority.  After all, what good is having Bradford if we don't have anyone to block for him.  It'd be the same old song and dance again."

StLouisRams,2yqxbo,Sinisterminister77,3,Thu Mar 12 14:36:51 2015 UTC,A new quarterback and a possible relocation dividing the fans in half. So pretty exciting from football and management standpoints.
StLouisRams,2yqxbo,codesius,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:16:37 2015 UTC,"Well in the past our QB position has been inconsistent which has led to inconsistent results. With Foles, I'm not sure that will change but it is yet to be determined. You can expect some exciting Defensive plays along with some fun run plays. You can expect some trickery, and some wins we probably dont deserve. To be honest, with a new QB and a new OC, Rams fans don't know what to expect either. Just know that all of us are always optimistic preseason!"
StLouisRams,2yqxbo,Thonked,1 point,Thu Mar 12 14:41:09 2015 UTC,Fisher is bringing in another defensive tackle when we have no offensive lineman  This is what to expect.
StLouisRams,2yqxbo,wowbagger88,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"Dominant front 7, especially if we can get some DT depth and maybe another sam linebacker.  Okay secondary - EJ Gaines had an unexpectedly good rookie year, and our safeties are decent.  Respectable run game which should only get better as Tre Mason matures and Greg Robinson develops into the run-blocking mauler we all know he can be.    The passing game is the big question - it'll be interesting to see how Foles plays in the Rams' system, and for that matter it'll be interesting to see what the Rams' system even is with the new OC.  Our WR corps has potential but has never really been able to put it on the field, although Stedman Bailey and Kenny Britt were both solid last year, and Brian Quick showed flashes of brilliance before getting hurt.    The draft and the remainder of free agency will probably determine a lot; assuming we re-sign WR Kenny Britt and OT Joe Barksdale, our big needs will be OG, WR, C, and LB, (in my opinion) in that order.   As far as actual games go, I think this thread has pretty well covered it – we'll hang around and even win games that we have no business winning, and we'll absolutely crap the bed in games that by all accounts we should win.  We're not fantastic at finishing games, either, as we choked several away last year.  I think that was mostly bad luck, though – we should regress this year towards being better finishers.  Outlook this next season: I'll conservatively say anywhere from 7 to 9 wins; maybe 10 or 11 if everything really comes together.  This division should be a little easier considering the dumpster fire that is SF right now, so at worst I see us finishing 3rd."

StLouisRams,2yplq5,DougDimmadome44,2,Thu Mar 12 01:38:37 2015 UTC,"Eagles fan here, Foles the first thing you'll notice is that he's HUGE. He will stay in there knowing he's going to take a hit and deliver the ball downfield. That was one of the reasons Andy Reid wanted to draft him.  In college, he just absolutely played with the worst O-Line and kept getting KILLED by lineman, but he stayed in the game and can throw under pressure. For the most part he's been healthy two issues he's had, concussion in 2013, broke his collarbone last year on a 'body slam'  He's going to get better and develop into an even better QB.  He's got that basketball background so he has good vision and makes plays while scrambling... Also, his deep ball is awesome.  I expect him to win at least 8 games next year if he stays healthy."

StLouisRams,2yogur,xKeyNin,12,Wed Mar 11 14:17:22 2015 UTC,Really want this to happen. Great dude on top of being a pretty good right tackle. Playing injured quite a bit last year is likely skewing his value to the cheaper side.   Stay home Joe! We need you!
StLouisRams,2yogur,The_Wayward,10,Wed Mar 11 14:35:26 2015 UTC,Keeping Barksdale should be our #1 priority if not finding a valuable replacement in free agency.
StLouisRams,2yogur,alderaan_never4get,4,Wed Mar 11 14:50:44 2015 UTC,"Retaining Joey B better be a priority, I'd rather have him holding down the right side than a question mark FA/ draft pick. If we can pick up Wiz and a decent left guard in free agency that frees up our 10th pick for draft day mobility, meaning more talent for Cig/Foles to work with."
StLouisRams,2yogur,oxygenjoe,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:25:00 2015 UTC,"This doesn't sound like a BAD idea, but I still think we need to trade back if possible and get line help. You don't build a solid line through free agency. All offense comes through that line.  Edit: O-lines have to mesh together and learn to work as a cohesive unit. An offensive line is like a smaller team within the team. Bringing in a bunch of FA may look great on paper, but if they are only around for a small amount of time, that doesn't give them enough time to start working together. Building through the draft allows the team to have one unit at all times that grows together."
StLouisRams,2yogur,BeefyMcFlaps,9,Wed Mar 11 22:53:36 2015 UTC,"If they can keep Barksdale, get Brandon Scherff in the first and a center in the 2nd or 3rd round and we could have a pretty solid & young line next year."

StLouisRams,2yogur,Hoj55,2,Wed Mar 11 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"Lets say we sign Blalock, and Wiz and resign Barksdale, do you guys think we will still draft another OL, in the first round, or would we get depth in the later rounds? thats what our OL would look like with the signings and re-signings  GROB-Blalock-Wiz-Saffold-Barksdale"

StLouisRams,2yp7pm,inandoutagain,19,Wed Mar 11 17:57:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe they did offer it to us. It could be a late first rounder.

StLouisRams,2yp7pm,Ihateunerds,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:12:49 2015 UTC,"Late first rounder means you already have a quarterback. I can't imagine any team giving up a first rounder to take on Bradfords contract, much less a playoff team where he would be a $13 million dollar backup."
StLouisRams,2yp7pm,inandoutagain,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:20:20 2015 UTC,But the Texans and Browns (2 first rounders) both have picks in the bottom half of the first round. I could see both of those teams trying to make a move for Bradford.
StLouisRams,2yp7pm,Ihateunerds,2,Thu Mar 12 02:14:17 2015 UTC,Ok but those are mid rounders. Late rounders are playoff teams.
StLouisRams,2yp7pm,swissflamdrag,5,Thu Mar 12 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"Because they wanted a starting caliber quarterback in the deal, and Cleveland doesn't have one."

We're not gonna get Winston, and Mariota is a bigger gamble than Foles. We get a shit ton of cap room and a guy who looks like he has a real future, with one year left on his rookie deal. If Foles looks good this year, we re-sign him long term. If not, we pack that 2nd rounder up with our 1st and make a run at a guy in next years (much deeper) QB class. Snead did good work here."

StLouisRams,2yogr0,xKeyNin,22,Wed Mar 11 14:16:20 2015 UTC,I believe this could be a really crucial signing. I think the development of our wide receivers really hinges on Britt's presence. Give Foles some improved receivers and focus on o-line in the draft... We've got a championship team here.
StLouisRams,2yogr0,TGMurray,22,Wed Mar 11 14:18:47 2015 UTC,"We've got a championship team here.   You're getting ahead of yourself there. Agree on the rest though, we need Britt back."

StLouisRams,2yogr0,wowbagger88,2,Wed Mar 11 21:02:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think we need Britt back but it would help.  The main problem I see with over paying for Britt is we already have a receiver on the roster that fills his role in Brian Quick.  With Britt, Quick, Austin, and Bailey, that's a little bit of a WR logjam.  I would take Britt back but I don't think it is imperative that we sign him either."

You get what amounts to a free trial run. Even if he plays stellar this year he isn't going to command Elite QB money, and you will still have exclusive rights to negotiate after the season. Plus, if he's playing well halfway through you could likely work out a deal.   However, if (and I doubt this happens. I was a Foles guy) he okays like shit, it costs you nothing and you've really lost nothing. Rams made out well in this trade IMO."

StLouisRams,2yoqy5,adamlikescheetos,3,Wed Mar 11 15:58:04 2015 UTC,Exactly. He fits in a 3-4. We are set at DE and he probably wouldn't fit well in a 4-3 as a coverage linebacker.

Plus we roll with a lot of 3 safeties bringing Barron down, it'd be a bad signing IMO."
StLouisRams,2yoqy5,ITameFatGirls,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:20:15 2015 UTC,He started his career as a 4-3 Sam.  It's not his natural position but he can play it.
StLouisRams,2yoqy5,hack5amurai,2,Wed Mar 11 17:26:11 2015 UTC,Too expensive for what would be a 2-down LB for us.
StLouisRams,2yoqy5,ismizz,0,Wed Mar 11 18:20:35 2015 UTC,I've been wondering why there hasn't been at least any rumors between the two
StLouisRams,2yoqn3,Shonuff88,7,Wed Mar 11 15:39:57 2015 UTC,This guy had 78 tackles in only 9 games last season for the Gmen.  Replacement for Dunbar?
StLouisRams,2yoqn3,ismizz,6,Wed Mar 11 17:59:24 2015 UTC,"From what I've read in the past 5 minutes he's a solid, no mistakes guy rather than a splash player. Sounds like a good player to pair with Barron at the vacant linebacker spot."
StLouisRams,2yoqn3,oxygenjoe,6,Wed Mar 11 18:20:02 2015 UTC,Who?
StLouisRams,2yoqn3,woostar64,6,Wed Mar 11 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"He's a good player. Very athletic. Originally he was used only as a coverage LB for us but he eventually (this past season) became a 3 down LB. He's gotten a lot better against the run. He's still good in coverage but he isn't great. He's better at covering speedy TE's, Jason Witten destroyed him all the time.  Overall he's a very solid player and I think a change of location will be very good for him. Should easily compete for the starting WLB, although I don't know your roster very well. He did have a concussion that kept him out several weeks. It was his first one (that I know of) but seemed to be a very serious one.  Oh...he also caused the fumble against the 49ers that sent us to our last super bowl...so there's that too.   Edit: Flaired up!"

StLouisRams,2yqj4i,Ramsmom,2,Wed Mar 11 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"It's a mix, a lot of folks were pretty upset about losing Bradford - but I think most (myself included) feel Foles could be our franchise QB. It's still too early to call but if we use this cap space wisely I won't have any regrets. Also getting the picks back from the Eagles was great business, IMO. This teams best parts came from the draft and we should stay committed to that."

StLouisRams,2ylff8,MacAnLuin,48,Tue Mar 10 20:03:46 2015 UTC,Les works wonders but I'm so afraid Sam is going to immediately blow it up in Philly.  He went from having one of the worst OCs in football to one of the best.
StLouisRams,2ylff8,Opifex,30,Tue Mar 10 20:06:51 2015 UTC,All talk in Philly right now are that Bradford is a trade piece to move up to Mariota.  Otherwise this makes absolutely NO sense from our perspective.
StLouisRams,2ylff8,mmuoio,11,Tue Mar 10 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"Does the rumor mill you're hearing involve trading Bradford to us for our 1st, 1st round pick and continuing to try to move up to nab Mariota?"

StLouisRams,2ylff8,panderson1988,4,Tue Mar 10 20:24:56 2015 UTC,He'll never play for the Eagles. He'll be traded to the Jets for their first round pick so Chip can grab Mariota when he falls down the draft board.

Nick Foles avoided so many sacks and moved around in that pocket so fucking well behind a non existing line. Not only does he have huge potential but he has a working ACL!!!! Please do eat the Sam Bradford contract up for us Philly.
StLouisRams,2ylff8,BrawndoTTM,4,Tue Mar 10 20:12:39 2015 UTC,WHAT THE FUCK?! I DON'T EVEN. THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME. Enjoy Bradford's constant injuries and ridiculous salary Eaglebros.

StLouisRams,2ylff8,Lewandirty,3,Tue Mar 10 20:12:58 2015 UTC,So we get Foles and draft picks? I'm okay with that. I thought we would have to send picks their way to make up for Bradford's contract.   How would this affect our cap space?

StLouisRams,2ylff8,Lewandirty,2,Tue Mar 10 20:10:16 2015 UTC,I'm all for this then. Foles is straddling that Dalton line but the Eagles have shown you can with Foles as your QB.   I would rather have the picks and cap space than a question mark at QB. Next year just got a whole lot more interesting.

The only switch is if Bradford starts less than half of the games = Eagles get 3rd  If he starts more than 8 games = Eagles get 4th...  Im sorry but Rams fans, we need to be happy with this trade.  I know its hard to have waited so long to see Bradfords true potential and now we wont even see him do it in a Rams jersey but come on...  His agent wasnt restructuring his deal, that cap hit was keeping us from doing anything, Foles has proven success and much less injury history, we keep our 10th pick in the draft with a 2nd rounder in the future.  What else do you need to hear to just call this one a win?  Snead and Fisher pull another big time trade to honestly attempt to improve this franchise and I believe they're right."

He was dealt a pretty shitty hand here and that rookie year he took one of the worst teams in NFL history and took them to 7-9. Personally I'll miss Sam a lot and Foles will have to win me over. Best of luck to you and the Eagles.

StLouisRams,2ylff8,crackalac,4,Tue Mar 10 20:23:12 2015 UTC,I just saw the deal about the pick but I'm calling bullshit on Bradford being better than Foles. Not that it matters because Bradford is made of balsa wood and cannot stay healthy.
StLouisRams,2ylff8,PomfAndCircvmstance,5,Tue Mar 10 20:33:12 2015 UTC,You're selling balsa wood short.
StLouisRams,2ylff8,bozo7337,-3,Tue Mar 10 21:26:23 2015 UTC,You are forgetting how good he was when he was healthy. The rams basically downgraded in players and picks in exchange for dumping salary.
StLouisRams,2ylff8,sinfolaw,2,Tue Mar 10 21:14:17 2015 UTC,"Bradford has never shown himself to be a notably better QB than Nick Foles (if anything Bradford doesn't have a season that approaches Nick Foles in 2013). He's been around an Andy Dalton caliber QB when he hasn't been injured so he's certainly not some irreplaceable talent.  Also if you have to clarify ""when he was healthy"" then that says all you need to know about Bradford right there. The guy is never healthy and dumping his salary is worth dropping down a few picks in the 1st round and throwing the Eagles a 2nd round pick. With a healthy QB and a few upgrades, upgrades that will be easier to acquire with their new found cap space, the Rams could easily contend for the playoffs.  Nick Foles and that extra cap room will do the Rams more good than a $15,000,000 clipboard holder."

I don't believe in Foles and this basically straight up trade makes feel weird. I'm a mixture of sad and pissed.   I'd rather give Bradford another shot and go down with him, than see what Foles has. And he's coming back from an injury as well. I know that it isn't as bad but it's still something.  I'm going to support Foles because he's a Ram now. I have a hard time accepting the move though.

Before either QB hits the field, the Rams will have the better pick in the upcoming draft.  Then they will also have the better pick in next years draft.  Point 1 and 2 to the Rams.  Then the contracts/cap space: 1 more point to the Rams, -1 from the Eagles.  When they do take the field, historically Foles is better in every respect: more rushing yds per carry, more TDs per game, fewer INTs per attempt, better completion percentage, to keep the score close, we'll just bundle that all up in 1 more point to the Rams.  Score so far: Rams 4, Eagles -1.  That's a deep hole to come out of to make this trade make any kind of sense for the Eagles.  Congrats on the Rams buggering Kelly and getting Kelly to say ""Thank you."""
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,HI_Handbasket,4,Wed Mar 11 13:01:07 2015 UTC,I've really been trying not to pile on; I hated the way we did that with the Skins trade and I actually like the Eagles.

I agree with most of what you're saying about the contract and draft compensation and how we got fleeced there, I'm not so sure it's fair to definitively say how much better Foles is.  While you are correct with your statistics, the differences aren't drastic enough to make a real case in some categories (1.9 to 2.2 INT rate, 58.6 to 61.6 completion%). You also have to take into account that while Bradford statistically has been a steady pillar of mediocrity, Foles has been pretty up and down.  If you take out the statistical 2013 outlier for Foles, then Bradford is a much better QB.  Idk what is going to happen in the future, but as good as Foles was in 2013, he was hot garbage last year.  It's uncertain which version the Rams will get, but one thing that Kelly has proven to be able to do is maximize the most out of his talent.  As bad as Sanchez was, he still had a career year last season.  I wouldn't write off their performances just yet."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,HI_Handbasket,1 point,Fri Mar 13 02:05:39 2015 UTC,"Foles has played for two years.  If you're going to throw out 2013 as a ""statistical outlier"" you should also toss 2014, leaving Foles with no statistics at all.  The fact is that Foles DID play each of those years, so discarding each or any is simply bullshit. What you can do is discard the many many games Bradford didn't play, not because they are ""statistical outliers"" but because he actually didn't play.  Regardless of circumstance, Foles has better numbers all around.  Plus he costs $!0m less than Bradford.  Plus his knees are fine.  Plus the Eagles would have a 2nd round pick next year... is Kelly getting lessons from Paul Holmgren?!"
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,ameis314,1 point,Fri Mar 13 06:12:26 2015 UTC,"You're correct, he had one great year and one awful year.  He also had about 6 games in 2012 where he could be considered meh, but much closer to bad then good.  I""m not ""throwing it out"" as you say, but I honestly think it's tough to say a guy is definitively better because of one fluke season where he was God's gift to the position.  As an Eagle fan, you're discounting the Kelly factor.  Regardless of your opinion of the man, one thing he has proven capable of doing is getting players on offense to maximize their potential.  DeSean Jackson, Jeremy Maclin, LeSean McCoy, Mark Sanchez, and even Nick Foles, all had their best statistical years under Chip.  That's a fact.  You're also discounting the Brian Schottenheimer effect, who has literally had the opposite effect (See Sanchez 2011, 2012).  And while Bradford's injury history is well documented, Foles hasn't exactly been the picture of perfect health either.  He's suffered an injury every season he's been a professional (including a broken hand in Week 16 of 2012 that would've cost him way more than just one game had it occurred any earlier in the season).  Again, I'm not saying it's going to work out, but considering Chip has gotten the best out of literally every player we've had on offense, If Bradford can stay healthy, I think we'll be just fine."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,ameis314,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"Sanchez' ""best year"" was half a year, and it was pretty awful, costing the Eagles a spot in the playoffs.  I have no idea why Kelly brought such a mediocre player back for more money.    A broken hand and a broken collar bone are quite a bit easier to come back from than consecutive ACL tears to the same knee.  The injuries are worlds apart."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,ismizz,-2,Sun Mar 15 04:44:51 2015 UTC,"Dude I'll just come out and say it.  Bradford might not pan out, but you're a moron if you think Nick Foles will amount to anything in the NFL.  He scrambles from clean pockets, he has terrible deep and short accuracy, he regularly misses wide open receivers, has terrible footwork, throws off his back foot, is a turnover machine, etc.  I could go on for days.  2013 was a statistical anomaly. I'm sorry, Rams fans.  Nick Foles is a nice guy.  He's a hard worker.  He's a team player.  But he is not a good QB.  Sanchez pretty awful half a year was still statistically better than Nick Foles half a year dude, so if that's how you feel about Sanchez, then you should feel elated that we no longer have NIck Foles on the roster, who was worse.  You may not like Sam Bradford, but one thing he has proven not to do throughout his career is turn the ball over.  The health is a huge question mark, but if Bradford does come back fully healthy, he is going to play leads and bounds better than Nick Foles next season."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,ameis314,2,Mon Mar 16 02:35:34 2015 UTC,"You babble on so much about how much you dislike Nick Foles I wonder who it was he banged, your mother or your girlfriend?  JK, that wasn't cool to write, but your vehemence is unfounded.  I don't dislike Bradford, I never met him and he never beat the Eagles, but in the NFL, statistically he is inferior in every single category to Foles.  This is just a fact.  As far as Bradford not turning the ball over as compared to Foles, Bradford tossed 38 interceptions in 4 years compared to Foles' 17 in three.  Foles' numbers were otherworldly last year, and came back to worse than normal this year, before he got hurt, but Bradford has been consistently worse than mediocre.  I'll give Bradford a shot, but he has proven jack shit so far."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,HI_Handbasket,-1,Mon Mar 16 04:26:04 2015 UTC,"Haha nothing you could say about my mother or girlfriend would upset me, random stranger.  I actually complimented Nick Foles as a person and a professional, he just sucks as a QB.  My vehemence is directed at him as a football player, and that is definitely founded by him and Sanchez combining with Bradley Fletcher to basically turn us from a playoff bound team to a cautionary statistic for future teams to reference.  In that,  ""otherworldly"" season Foles had, PFF counted 19 drops against him, if they were caught. That's 27 - 21.  If half of them were caught, that's 27 - 11.  And of couse, then he wouldn't have set the record for QB rating and so on.  Nick Foles is teammate A #1,  but he will be lucky to be the next Ryan Fitzpatrick.  Last year was closer to the true Foles then 2013 as evidenced by his mediocre 2012 season where he showed so much promise that Chip Kelly felt the need to resign a then 32 year old mike Vick."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,ismizz,2,Mon Mar 16 05:19:57 2015 UTC,If bradford doesn't start bc he is traded do we still get the pick?
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,ameis314,2,Wed Mar 11 05:04:41 2015 UTC,"If I understand the deal correctly, we send the Eagles a 2016 fourth-round pick if he doesn't start at least eight games, or a 2016 third-round pick if he doesn't play at all."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,wowbagger88,3,Wed Mar 11 06:09:57 2015 UTC,What happens if bradford is traded? Do we get the pick?
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,ameis314,5,Wed Mar 11 11:11:16 2015 UTC,"presumably this falls under the ""doesn't play at all"" (for the Eagles) contingency."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,brotha_nature,3,Wed Mar 11 12:22:46 2015 UTC,"But they received value by trading him, would this not be considered a full season's value?"
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,Simorebut,3,Wed Mar 11 12:35:07 2015 UTC,"Dammit, you already screwed the Eagles' blue, and you want to wipe off on their curtains too?!"
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,JKaye57,2,Wed Mar 11 13:02:30 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if starting 8 games for another team satisfies this criteria
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,Simorebut,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:34:05 2015 UTC,"I would argue that however many games he starts for the third team is irrelevant, the Eagles got full value by using him as trade leverage while he is healthy"
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,JKaye57,2,Wed Mar 11 14:31:49 2015 UTC,"If there was a specific trade clause, I think it would have been brought up. Especially with the rumors swirling around.  I'm guessing those stipulations are very literal. Even if Bradford alone manages to draw a first round pick, he still didn't play any snaps for the Eagles."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,Simorebut,0,Wed Mar 11 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"As a side note, if they trade bradford for mariota chip Kelly is a fucking evil genius... and i hope the rams move because they are all incompetent"
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,JKaye57,12,Wed Mar 11 15:43:38 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thanks man. Hope Chip pans this all out into a megamastermind plan because right now its not looking too hot there right now.
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,Ihateunerds,8,Wed Mar 11 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"I'm really at a loss.  Even if this is somehow only part 1 of some other plan, I don't get why we have to give up a 2nd round pick as well and why we couldn't convince you guys to swap firsts.  I thought Foles had a bright future and had a good skill set.  He's made some very impressive throws these past 2 seasons.  I think you guys are going to be very happy with Foles."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,JKaye57,6,Wed Mar 11 00:51:18 2015 UTC,Can someone explain to me what we get in Sam Bradford?
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,Ship_of_Fools26,14,Wed Mar 11 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly...it's tough to tell at this point. When Bradford is healthy, there's so much potential for him to be a great QB. He has the arm, the accuracy, he can make the reads and do all of it. But he's always been surrounded by mediocre talent. He had Steven Jackson who was injured a lot and on the downside of his career. An offensive line that was always in pieces. His best wide receiver most years was either Amendola or Brandon Gibson.   Before his injury in 2013, it seemed like things were finally clicking. He was getting to that point where he was putting up solid numbers. Then he tore his ACL. And then he did it again. You're getting a quarterback who's only played in a couple of pre-season games over the last year and a half. I don't know what his mobility is like at this point. It was never great to begin with but with a twice torn ACL...I don't know.  I hope he does well with the Eagles. If he even plays a snap with the Eagles. You're getting a guy with talent, that's for sure"
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,reddit_on_my_phone,3,Wed Mar 11 00:56:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks, i've been trying to defend this trade.. Hopefully this turns out good.."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,Ship_of_Fools26,4,Wed Mar 11 00:59:11 2015 UTC,"It's tough to defend. To me, the only true way this works out for the Eagles is if they flip Bradford and their 1st, and maybe another pick to a high 1st round pick and grab Mariota. That's what all of this has to be for. Or else I just don't get what Chip is doing."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,ThomYorkesFingers,5,Wed Mar 11 01:00:31 2015 UTC,Or maybe Bradford plays lights out.. ?? who knows??
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,SayHeyRay,7,Wed Mar 11 01:01:33 2015 UTC,If he does that'd be great. I just don't think he's actually Chip Kelly's guy.
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,Ship_of_Fools26,2,Wed Mar 11 01:04:36 2015 UTC,"Even that doesn't make much sense. If Bradford is worth a top five pick to somebody, why wouldn't the Rams just cut out the middle man and make that move themselves? Even if getting Foles has been our endgame all along, we still could've held that pick for ransom to Chip Kelly's hardon for Mariota. Then gotten basically the same thing we did from the Eagles if we chose to do so.   I'm astonished by this move and officially have no clue what Kelly is thinking here. Foles would've been the more valuable trade chip over Bradford in a package for Mariota.  The only logic I can see behind this move is that Kelly actually just prefers to move forward with Bradford rather than Foles.  They also gave up a 2016 2nd rounder that could've been part of a draft day trade up.  I just don't see how they even have the means to pull that off anymore beyond a ridiculous RGIII type haul at this point.  Future first rounders are now their only asset."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,SayHeyRay,2,Wed Mar 11 04:27:33 2015 UTC,Fuck if I know man. I'm just tryina speculate what it could be.
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,wowbagger88,2,Wed Mar 11 06:20:04 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how he tore his ACL? Like did it just pop or was it an awkward tackle or something? And was it the same knee? Full disclosure, I'm a philly fan and needless to say I'm having a bad night - Bradford was in no way on any eagles fan's radar."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,3146669420,3,Wed Mar 11 02:51:07 2015 UTC,Same knee. I don't remember the first one. But last year's was a non-contact.
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,houseofpayne55,5,Wed Mar 11 02:53:46 2015 UTC,Christ. Don't see how this could get any worse. Time to call it a day.
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,DiscoJer,3,Wed Mar 11 02:59:18 2015 UTC,"Maclin's torn ACL was non contact during training camp, sometimes it's just a freak accident. I hope Bradford can come back from it"
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,Trainwrek,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"With the first tear I think he was just shoved out of bounds. He may have tried to come back too soon with the second one, because it was on a totally normal play in the preseason.  He's so talented when healthy, but it's just hard to be optimistic about him staying out there for a full season. If he is though, he's got the pieces to be great. I'm also not sure who has a high enough draft back to grab Mariota who would trade for him right now, but who knows!"
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,Yji,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, thanks for the info. I'm interested to see if you guys extend Foles or not.

I have no goddamn idea what's going on with my team."

StLouisRams,2ymf1c,Psychart5150,2,Wed Mar 11 02:19:09 2015 UTC,"The jury is still completely out with Sam. He showed that he can make all of the throws, but when he was starting he had absolutely nothing around him and thus didnt win many games. He has average to above average arm strength with possibly elite level accuracy. But he really hasnt played in two years and I have no idea what kind of QB he is now. He has proven that he can thrive in a spread like he ran at Oklahoma. But until he stays healthy no one really knows what Sam Bradford is."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,captain65,2,Wed Mar 11 00:58:50 2015 UTC,"You get a quiet, unassuming guy that won't win many games for you, but won't lose them, either. He doesn't make many mistakes, but at the same time, he also doesn't take a lot of risks, almost always taking a short throw over anything else."
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,mlasn,5,Wed Mar 11 01:44:27 2015 UTC,Give Foles a solid O-line and he will succeed. I'll miss him.
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,hampsted,3,Wed Mar 11 06:04:01 2015 UTC,This is awesome man. I appreciate it.
StLouisRams,2ymf1c,furiousxgeorge,3,Wed Mar 11 01:55:06 2015 UTC,"Bradford has a great arm and is very capable of leading Kelly's offense. Sam's biggest problem has been his health. He has one of the lowest int% numbers in the NFL he's very good with the ball. 2013 before he got hurt he had 17 td and 4 int and all four of those ints were tipped at the line or bounced off recievers hands. The biggest thing I can say is if he stays healthy, and with his ACL that's a huge if, you got a very good QB for your offense. He's expensive and in the last year of a bad deal but he could be a damned good QB for you. He didn't want to restructure or extend here in St Louis but that might be different in Philly. Best of luck going forward man thanks for sharing the great work on Foles. I hope he grows on me I was a big Bradford backer."

Either Sam Bradford is somehow a more desirable trade piece than Nick Foles (which, yet again, baffles me considering Bradford's contract and injury issues) or Chip Kelly really thinks Bradford is his guy.  When I first heard about this trade I assumed Kelly was gearing up to make a run at Mariota with extra/higher picks but unless somebody in the top 6 (Buccaneers, Titans, Redskins, Jets) is in love with Bradford and covets him I can't see how this helps the Eagles get Mariota.  edit: So the Rams keep the 2nd rounder no matter what?

Also if you trade him I think we lose that 2016 second rounder so there's that."
StLouisRams,2ym3bo,D33GS,3,Wed Mar 11 00:49:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not doubting Bradford's talent.  But also feel we never gave Foles much of a shot.  Played great the year before last and played decently behind a battered O-line before getting hurt last year.  The cap hit with Bradford compared to Foles hurts as well.  I think you guys keep the 2nd round pick no matter what.  You just would have to return a compensation pick possibly a third or lower.

StLouisRams,2ym3bo,SalukiDawgMaroon,-3,Wed Mar 11 01:49:31 2015 UTC,Go through is post history?
StLouisRams,2ym3bo,tylerseher,-3,Wed Mar 11 01:50:36 2015 UTC,I just did.. What's wrong with it? He talks about hanging out with Jeremy Maclin and stuff.
StLouisRams,2ym3bo,SalukiDawgMaroon,2,Wed Mar 11 01:58:34 2015 UTC,He was writing comments in game threads?

StLouisRams,2ym3bo,llandar,2,Tue Mar 10 23:13:59 2015 UTC,Per Schefter we get the 2nd round pick regardless now.

What's stopping the Eagles from putting Sanchez out there for the 1st play from scrimmage week 1 then immediately subbing Bradford in?  So many questions"
StLouisRams,2ym3bo,swagcakes,2,Tue Mar 10 22:57:20 2015 UTC,If he starts eight games.
StLouisRams,2ym3bo,ThirdTimesAnAlt,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:01:36 2015 UTC,"Well, that kills the happiness somewhat. Is that just if he doesn't start any games this season, or if he's not the starter week 1? Do we know?"

StLouisRams,2ym3bo,dlnvf6,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:06:57 2015 UTC,Yeah that's my point.  Why the hell did they make the trade if they aren't planning on making him the starter this year? I could see if it was like on the condition he's on the roster for the 2016 year.  Then they could cut him if he was bad and get it back
StLouisRams,2ym3bo,crackalac,0,Tue Mar 10 23:11:21 2015 UTC,"Well they are planning on starting him but if something happens and he can't, it's their insurance. I just don't like it from the rams' side."

StLouisRams,2ym3bo,okcodex,1 point,Thu Mar 12 13:26:38 2015 UTC,"You are correct, if it ends up being the Rams I hope you guys get a team and rebrand, personally I rather get a team without any real history like th chargers and rebrand"
StLouisRams,2ym3bo,undead_tortoise,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"I promised if Nick Foles got traded, I'd start watching whatever team he got traded to along with my Eagles. Forever a Nick Foles man. Guess I'm a Rams fan now too. Sup guys!"
StLouisRams,2ynxus,price-iz-right,7,Wed Mar 11 10:31:53 2015 UTC,"Resign Barksdale and Britt, sign one of the centers from Oakland or Kansas City, and get Sherif at #10 over all and I could easily see us in the wild card next year. On another note, does it seem like Fisher and snead are playing this off season like it's their last shot in St Louis?"
StLouisRams,2ynxus,pleasexplain,2,Wed Mar 11 11:13:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if they are making moves like it is their last shot...however I'm under the firm belief that they should be making moves like that regardless. That goes for across the NFL. The real threat of losing your job should be the motivation behind putting 100% into your decisions and actions.  I think they have done great things for this team in the past five years. Their only hiccup has been the unfortunate situation with Bradford's knee.   Time will only tell if we just pulled another Warner and sent a good guy to a better team, or if we pulled a trade rape and Foles lights it up for us."
StLouisRams,2ynxus,UnwillingFather,2,Wed Mar 11 11:37:46 2015 UTC,I don't really agree with that. I think sometimes if coaches/GMs feel like they have to win or they are on the way out they make dumb decisions to win a game or two more this year while screwing their team over for the long run.  I don't think most coaches/Gm's need extra motivation to try and win games.
StLouisRams,2ynxus,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,3,Wed Mar 11 19:00:47 2015 UTC,How the fuck you gonna leave out my boy Harkey?
StLouisRams,2ynxus,_Username_Colon_,3,Wed Mar 11 14:23:40 2015 UTC,Holy fuck you are correct...damn we have come a long way
StLouisRams,2ynxus,surferkwc,2,Wed Mar 11 15:56:02 2015 UTC,People seem to be forgetting how bad the Eagles o line was while Foles was playing last year.
StLouisRams,2ynxus,mbsob,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:18:50 2015 UTC,"I would not trade Stacy right away, it is always good to have back-up plans just in case.   We should resign Britt, and hope Quick can recover. I can see drafting a WR but in the later rounds, maybe with the 2nd round pick we got from the Eagles.  As for an O-line, we should resign Barksdale because he wasnt that bad but we can either look to FA or draft players and build around them like Dallas has over the next couple of drafts."
StLouisRams,2ynxus,surferkwc,3,Wed Mar 11 12:50:54 2015 UTC,I believe the extra second round pick is in the 2016 draft.
StLouisRams,2ynxus,hack5amurai,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:40:46 2015 UTC,"You are correct, I must have misread the information, this has been very confusing with the certain draft picks."
StLouisRams,2ynxus,Bmallar1,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:47:59 2015 UTC,Barksdale is hella underrated.  Davin Joseph was 100 percent of his problems last year.  When saffold was next to him he was solid as usual.
StLouisRams,2ynxus,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:03:11 2015 UTC,we need to also get another OLB and possibly another CB that plays a little more consistent than Jenkins
StLouisRams,2ynxus,hack5amurai,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"I think Jenkins plays consistent...his problem is he bites for the big play. Sometimes we get erections when it turns out well...sometimes we scream when he dives for the interception and misses giving up a score. That's what we are ever going to get out of Jenkins...and I think I'm ok with it. He is aggressive, he never plays safe."
StLouisRams,2ynxus,librarianC,2,Wed Mar 11 15:57:33 2015 UTC,He's also our most willing and solid tackler in our secondary.
StLouisRams,2ynxus,Ihateunerds,1 point,Wed Mar 11 23:42:24 2015 UTC,It would be a lot better if we had a true cover safety to back him up but fisher doesn't seem to want any coverage safeties.

StLouisRams,2ymuub,MacAnLuin,12,Wed Mar 11 02:24:37 2015 UTC,Case Keenum for Super Bowl 50 MVP
StLouisRams,2ymuub,JackD440,10,Wed Mar 11 02:31:58 2015 UTC,In all fairness I am very happy with acquiring Keenum. He should be a decent backup for us. I can't remember the last time we have had a truly viable second string.
StLouisRams,2ymuub,One_Half_Hamster,7,Wed Mar 11 02:54:43 2015 UTC,Marc Bulger behind Kurt Warner?
StLouisRams,2ymuub,chemshua,6,Wed Mar 11 12:15:32 2015 UTC,Kurt Warner behind Trent Green?
StLouisRams,2ymuub,Noobguy27,2,Wed Mar 11 13:12:00 2015 UTC,"Well, he said the ""last time."" Sure Kurt Warner behind Trent Green might have been the greatest backup in history… but Bulger was a truly viable 2nd string QB"
StLouisRams,2ymuub,chemshua,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:12:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, I believe so. That's a lot longer ago than it seems."
StLouisRams,2ymuub,One_Half_Hamster,2,Wed Mar 11 13:41:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Definitely happy with our current QB situation of Foles, Keenum, and Davis"
StLouisRams,2ymuub,axle69,0,Wed Mar 11 02:57:40 2015 UTC,Austin Davis is better in my opinion hope he turns some heads in camps this season. All he needs is to learn to sense pressure a little sooner so he's not launching footballs off of his Back foot so often and he's a good QB.
StLouisRams,2ymuub,DiscoJer,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"I wish we had given him a couple starts last year, to be honest.  Hill kind of sucked."
StLouisRams,2ylser,gabers24,9,Tue Mar 10 21:28:31 2015 UTC,"Red zone threat, 5 tds vs cooks 3 tds last year"
StLouisRams,2ylser,bleedblue89,5,Tue Mar 10 21:33:29 2015 UTC,He's also a great blocker.
StLouisRams,2ylser,kersey79,3,Wed Mar 11 03:22:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, you can't ask much more of a TE than Lance Kendricks delivers. He's not elite, but he's better at blocking than most TEs and he still has reliable hands and is good for 4-5 TDs a year. I have no problem paying him a few mil to keep him around, especially considering he's one of the few veteran draft picks that has actually kinda worked out for us."
StLouisRams,2ylser,frankoftank,7,Wed Mar 11 05:07:02 2015 UTC,That seems like too much.
StLouisRams,2ylser,Lewandirty,7,Tue Mar 10 21:29:49 2015 UTC,"He has been pretty solid for us, but yeah does seem like a lot for a #2 TE"
StLouisRams,2ylser,Tre2,6,Tue Mar 10 21:31:29 2015 UTC,Maybe we are cutting cook.
StLouisRams,2ylser,The_Wayward,2,Tue Mar 10 21:32:12 2015 UTC,We'd only save $600K this year. Trade him for a mid round pick and draft someone in the first 2 days though...
StLouisRams,2ylser,Lewandirty,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:46:40 2015 UTC,The TE prospects kinda suck this year don't they? Except Funchess as a possible convert.
StLouisRams,2ylser,The_Wayward,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"I like Williams quite a bit. Warford has potential, and yeah Funchness. It's absolutely wishful thinking, but I'm not a fan of how much we have invested in these two."

StLouisRams,2ylser,ptabs226,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:31:37 2015 UTC,Wait until the guarantee money comes out. $5MM a year is likely the high end. I bet the guarantee money will be a lot less.
StLouisRams,2ylser,jrose6717,6,Tue Mar 10 21:45:14 2015 UTC,I think we know what we get with him. So why not keep him.
StLouisRams,2ylser,helpimnaked,6,Tue Mar 10 21:31:27 2015 UTC,I'm really happy about this
StLouisRams,2ylser,ITameFatGirls,10,Tue Mar 10 21:34:51 2015 UTC,"This is the NFL, guareented money is all that matters, how much is he due in the first two years of the contract.  Have to wait for the details."
StLouisRams,2ylser,Darknight622,7,Tue Mar 10 21:36:24 2015 UTC,"Most people don't realize this, but it is so true. Too many people get worked up about the sum total of the contract before they know the details."

StLouisRams,2ynbm3,Shonuff88,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:00:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. Seems a bit... wasteful on this team. He probably wouldn't want to come here either. That is, unless they plan on him taking Ogletree's place. Which I don't think will happen."
StLouisRams,2ynbm3,wowbagger88,2,Wed Mar 11 16:30:46 2015 UTC,Isn't he a Sam?  We really need a decent Sam linebacker.  Running nickel 100 percent of the time is I'll advised.
StLouisRams,2ynbm3,hack5amurai,2,Wed Mar 11 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he'd be replacing Dunbar.  Like I said in the other thread, WR and OL. Don't kill Foles like we killed Bradford. A Dunbar upgrade would be nice, but I don't know how important that is."
StLouisRams,2ynbm3,wowbagger88,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:34:45 2015 UTC,If we get britt back the only wide receivers that is be comfortable taking are white and cooper.  Line for sure.

StLouisRams,2ylo24,Shonuff88,-10,Tue Mar 10 21:01:50 2015 UTC,Except with comparable amount of playing time both Austin Davis and Shaun Hill outplayed Foles last year on significantly worse offense......................
StLouisRams,2ylo24,NewBroPewPew,12,Tue Mar 10 21:49:08 2015 UTC,well thats just not true
StLouisRams,2ylo24,SlammbosSlammer,-2,Tue Mar 10 22:03:47 2015 UTC,What part isn't true? Both Davis and Hill had better stats in every category. Davis with the same amount of starts. Both had better rating than Foles. Eagles offense numbers accross the board were top 5.....so what part of my statement isn't true?
StLouisRams,2ylo24,NewBroPewPew,8,Tue Mar 10 22:13:05 2015 UTC,"Situational football..Foles won games with a worse defense than what Austin Davis and Shaun Hill had with the Rams defense. Davis' numbers came near the end of games when defenses eased up and played prevent. Often, it was Davis' own mistakes in the first half that led to those deficits. I'd argue Foles is better at protecting the ball and limiting costly turnovers and mistakes to give us a better chance to win near the end of each game"
StLouisRams,2ylo24,doraroks,6,Tue Mar 10 22:58:09 2015 UTC,"Well Foles threw for 2163 yds and 13 tds while Davis had 2001 yds and 12 tds and Hill had 1657 yds and 8 tds. Foles also rushed for more yards. Hill and Davis had marginally better ratings, but they all fell within 81-85. Foles was slightly less accurate but also can throw the ball more than 20 yards. Foles clearly didn't have his best year but literally no one would take Hill or Davis over him."
StLouisRams,2ylo24,SlammbosSlammer,-2,Tue Mar 10 22:55:28 2015 UTC,yards per average are the same for Davis and Foles so the 20 yards remark doesn't hold up. Foles did have minuscule y better stats.............on a stacked offense and Davis wasn't even on the roster at the start of the season.
StLouisRams,2ylo24,NewBroPewPew,3,Tue Mar 10 23:11:30 2015 UTC,Ok so you want Davis to start over Foles next year?
StLouisRams,2ylo24,SlammbosSlammer,-2,Tue Mar 10 23:37:08 2015 UTC,"Noooooope, Just don't want a mediocre Qb as my number 1!"
StLouisRams,2ylo24,NewBroPewPew,3,Wed Mar 11 00:25:55 2015 UTC,I can't take you seriously with your Austin-Davis-face flair.
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,ManofTucson,13,Tue Mar 10 20:10:53 2015 UTC,We should have 30 mil now right? Fuck yeah let's make some moves!
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,bnsaluki,41,Tue Mar 10 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"I don't care, I need to mope for a little bit. I know the move makes sense or whatever, but Bradford is my favorite player. When I found out he was being drafted by my favorite team, I was so happy. Now Steven and Bradford are gone. Just makes me sad."
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,Kicker0fE1ves,16,Tue Mar 10 20:14:42 2015 UTC,I wouldn't know how to feel if Sam tears it up behind a really good Oline and against much worse defenses
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,AlecanderTheGreat,24,Tue Mar 10 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"If by ""it"" you mean his ACL I'd know exactly how I'd feel. Unsurprised."
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,BrawndoTTM,2,Tue Mar 10 20:25:21 2015 UTC,"Happy for him, sad for us when it comes to light that Foles isn't that great. People will just say Bradford's a system QB if he does light it up though, so that will never die. Ugh."
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,Kicker0fE1ves,12,Tue Mar 10 20:21:09 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have to be Aaron Rodgers to be an improvement, he just has to be healthy and serviceable.  We can go from there"
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,StraightfromSTL,3,Tue Mar 10 20:23:58 2015 UTC,Yep. Stay vertical and be just good enough to keep defenses honest.
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,SQLDave,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:18:05 2015 UTC,"Foles is younger than Shaun Hill and I'm pretty sure he can actually throw a deep ball compared to Austin Davis. I'm liking this trade because watching our QBs play last year was pretty brutal, Foles has to be an improvement. With Bradford it was just too much concern if he stays healthy or not, I hope he does though in Philly and reaches his potential"
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,sweeps28,5,Wed Mar 11 06:23:49 2015 UTC,"Even if foles is average, which is my belief, I think it still makes sense to trade. Its hard to keep waiting on him to stay healthy. If he is healthy he will probably always be the better QB on teams. I hope he tears it up in Philly and stays healthy for his career. I'll be a Philly fan if he is playing there and draft him in fantasy if he gets the start because I believe he can be good. Only people who have never watched Bradford would think he is a system QB. Hopefully foles proves us wrong and does great or we are no longer cash strapped by a QB. Excited to see how this plays out."
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,MisQ,0,Tue Mar 10 20:26:59 2015 UTC,"Most of the people that say super detrimental things about Sam haven't watched any film, but I dunno, it doesn't stop the talk from annoying me. Oh well, I'm the last person that can actually look at this trade rationally."
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,Kicker0fE1ves,2,Tue Mar 10 20:39:20 2015 UTC,I'm not sad at all.  I'm pumped

StLouisRams,2ylh4n,bjsy92,4,Wed Mar 11 02:11:20 2015 UTC,I understand completely. I loved Bradford and he could have and still can be amazing. It reminds me when the Cardinals traded Allen Craig to the Red Sox. He was and is still my favorite player and it is hard to get over.
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,Markcann,6,Tue Mar 10 21:28:14 2015 UTC,How much space do we actually have? With a source?  Would have been nice to pick up Bulaga when he was wanting to leave Green Bay.
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,tylerseher,6,Tue Mar 10 20:21:56 2015 UTC,"In a rough estimate, it looks like we had $2,779,097 then we traded $12,985,000 (Bradford), cut $9,250,000 (J. Long), and cut $2,000,000 (Wells) and we added $1,522,000 (Foles); so all in all we now have: $25,492,097.00  Source: http://overthecap.com/salary-cap-space/   But note, I'm really bad with math."
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,tjs2215,2,Tue Mar 10 21:21:35 2015 UTC,Thanks. I just hadn't seen anything concrete yet.   What do we do with this space? We've never been a big free agency team so I feel like we will just sit on it.
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,tylerseher,2,Tue Mar 10 22:22:04 2015 UTC,Last week we were 6th from the bottom on that list IIRC. So happy
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,New_DudeToo,10,Wed Mar 11 01:59:49 2015 UTC,"the thing is if bradford does see the field under chip kelly, and doesn't get injured, he will put up great numbers.  Bradford is a great talent whether we like it or not, the injuries are the entire risk, not what bradford can do when healthy.  Bradford>foles when healthy, but dat cap tho"
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,ralphsam,3,Tue Mar 10 22:02:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised at all to see him go out and tear it up with the Eagles. But even so I think the Rams win this thing hugely, because it's such a big risk. And they don't need a superstar, they just need someone decently good. And omg dat cap room."
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,SayHeyRay,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:41:26 2015 UTC,The 2nd round pick made that less of a concern.  Bradford should excel in chips offense. In a few years this could be seen as a win/win. The rams get a good qb with fewer health concerns. And the eagles take a big gamble on a great qb with huge health concerns.
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,ptabs226,4,Tue Mar 10 23:48:32 2015 UTC,"Just because we have a lot of cash doesn't mean we need to overpay and go crazy people.  Hopefully they'll add Barksdale and Wisniewski, take care of Britt.  It's not terrible to roll some over to next year so we can position ourselves to target higher end FA's next off-season early on."
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,ITameFatGirls,9,Tue Mar 10 21:42:25 2015 UTC,Wisneiwski Barksdale Trade for Drew Brees  BOOM

StLouisRams,2ylh4n,ismizz,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:38:19 2015 UTC,"I was hoping this would end up in us getting Brees, but his contract is 26M and if the Saints traded him it'd give them $15M next year and $7.5M the year after in dead money, so I don't think they're going to do it. People were believing Brady trade-rumors this time last year."
StLouisRams,2ylh4n,Unforgettable_Name,3,Wed Mar 11 05:30:59 2015 UTC,"Barksdale, Wisniewski, Britt.  Don't make the same mistakes we made with Bradford. Keep Foles up and give him someone to throw to."

StLouisRams,2ym75r,bnsaluki,15,Tue Mar 10 23:16:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly love this trade now. It's sad to see Sam Bradford go, and I was going to back him if he stayed, but the dude didn't restructure his contract. I'm excited to see the team go forward with Foles."
StLouisRams,2ym75r,Vanscoten,8,Tue Mar 10 23:18:58 2015 UTC,Exactly. Fish/Snead did what they needed to to continue making this team better and didn't let their emotions lead their decisions. Now we can use all this extra cap space to shore up the OL and prepare our team to make the run to SB50!!
StLouisRams,2ym75r,To3z,5,Tue Mar 10 23:25:12 2015 UTC,This looks to be a great deal now. Especially if we can extend Foles and draft a young guy.

Seems like they can maneuver around the draft with ease. (RG3 trade, Tavon Austin trade up, Olgetree trade down, Brockers trade down, amoung the day 2 and day 3 trades of the draft)"

Foles at least has real NFL experience and actually flashed the ability to be one of the best in the NFL in 2013. He got beat up last year and struggled, but the Eagles were missing 4/5ths of their O line when Foles was starting."

StLouisRams,2ymggv,SaucemanXL,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:30:17 2015 UTC,"Early indicators lean towards Justin Blalock, who would be a decent 2 year stop-gap.  My ideal situation involves retaining Barksdale for about $5M (Something like 3yr/$16.5M), then going after Stefen Wisniewski (aggressively) and picking up Blalock for insurance.  With that said, I'd still love to see someone like Scherff with #10, giving us something along these lines to protect our new investment:  G. Robinson | R. Saffold | S. Wisniewski | B. Scherff | J. Barksdale  We also have Blalock that start at RG if Scherff needs time, and can also come in for the second half after Saffold takes his weekly injury break."
StLouisRams,2ymggv,sweeps28,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:04:19 2015 UTC,Seeing that lineup almost brought a tear to my eye.

StLouisRams,2ymggv,SaucemanXL,1 point,Wed Mar 11 10:34:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree that getting Britt locked up for 2-4 years would be a great play. I'd also like to see the Rams draft a run-stuffing OLB (I like run-stuffing because with Ogletree and Barron, I think we have the packages to switch into a more pass-defensive front) and a legitimate centerfield FS.  Man, imagine that OL blocking for our 3-headed Mason/Stacy/Cunningham while Foles passes to Britt, Quick, Austin, and Stedman (not to mention Cook and Kendricks)."
StLouisRams,2ymggv,To3z,3,Wed Mar 11 11:52:27 2015 UTC,Even with all the cap space there still isn't any amazing FA OL players out there. I think we still go Scherff and then BPA.
StLouisRams,2ymggv,bwc_28,2,Wed Mar 11 00:31:57 2015 UTC,Shaq Thompson as an eventual replacement for Jo Lonn would be awesome after a trade down. He's going to be such a beast in the NFL. Hard to believe with how bad UW was last year that they've got two guys who are top 15 picks probably (plus Peterson).
StLouisRams,2ymggv,Yji,2,Wed Mar 11 00:40:22 2015 UTC,Scherff. Needs to be Scherff for me. I can live with Cooper or White but I need to fix the line.
StLouisRams,2ymggv,bozo7337,2,Wed Mar 11 01:54:09 2015 UTC,"Depending on free agency, if we sign Wisniewski, Blalock and Barksdale that is, I'm hoping for Amari Cooper, Kevin White or Trae Waynes at #10."

StLouisRams,2ym96h,mlasn,12,Tue Mar 10 23:40:04 2015 UTC,"Meh, it's fine.  Gonna be chaos either way and mostly they are still convinced this is a 7th dimensional chess move to get Mariota somehow."
StLouisRams,2ym96h,furiousxgeorge,5,Tue Mar 10 23:34:41 2015 UTC,"Reading your history, it seems like you acknowledge or are happy about Sammy B being your Qb next year. He could easily be a top 10 qb if you guys can play to his strengths and give him the time to get that knee to 100%. He is honestly my favorite player in the NFL. Every time except when they are playing the Rams, I'll be cheering for you guys."
StLouisRams,2ym96h,furiousxgeorge,6,Tue Mar 10 23:41:55 2015 UTC,I think I would have preferred another shot for Foles and maybe spend some of that Bradford money on keeping McCoy or Maclin but obviously Kelly didn't see it that way and lost faith in Foles.     I didn't want to trade the draft for Mariota. This seems like the best they could probably do given what was available this year if they wanted to move on from Foles.  Hope it works out for both teams.
StLouisRams,2ym96h,Snow_Regalia,5,Tue Mar 10 23:45:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's fine if ya'll come over and chill. The deal definitely looks worse than when it was first announced and the picks were unknown, but none of us really believe the roller coaster ride is over re:QB situation, so we're just wildly speculating on what the next move is."

Getting rid of Shady McCoy and Maclin too? If Bradford is going to be your QB, in pre-season last year his arm looked amazing. Throwing the ball like a laser. I just hope for you guys he stays healthy and reaches his full potential"

Also looking forward to our matchup. Always a great defensive football game.  BTW congrats on Foles. He played his college ball here in my hometown. Really good kid. His best attribute is his ability to move on from mistakes, and staying poised in big moments."

I'm sure Carroll has some sort of plan to move on from Unger. Should be some great football to look forward to next season. Congrats on Graham! Should be interesting to see how he does in Seattle, although I don't know if I'll ever get used to seeing him wolf grey."
StLouisRams,2yle69,BrawndoTTM,0,Wed Mar 11 18:07:49 2015 UTC,"It's awkward for sure, even for us. He won't be a big stat guy in our system so I'm not sure what to expect. Usually big trades like this don't work, but TE was a big need and this draft class is absolutely poor. The fact that people are praising this Maxx Williams guy as a potential 1st rounder is silly.Nothing against the kid. Good player, but I think it speaks more to the fact that this class is weak, as opposed to him being the best of a strong class. Schneider and Carroll won't handicap themselves for the big name. They have something up their sleeve and that's probably the most intriguing part about this move for me. i wonder what they do to follow this up. Not necessarily the deal itself."
StLouisRams,2yle69,Cyoplasm,5,Wed Mar 11 20:47:58 2015 UTC,It sucks and I'm REALLY not looking forward to it but I'm sure the Rams will be ready for him.

StLouisRams,2yle69,ItsBiggy,2,Wed Mar 11 06:04:04 2015 UTC,"Then they found out he's not that good in coverage. He's a run-stopping safety with the size to match up, but not much else."
StLouisRams,2yle69,rloftis6,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:01:57 2015 UTC,And their running game was garbage last year without Max Unger. He's a big loss for them.

I'll be curious how well his numbers will be with Wilson and not pass happy saints. Also if im not mistaken, he has had lingering issues over the last 2 years and it could get worse. Seattle has to hit on all their draft picks because they cant really be big players in free agency or at least I hope they can't."

StLouisRams,2yjup4,pleasexplain,14,Tue Mar 10 12:24:17 2015 UTC,"I really thought the Raiders would retain him and we'd have a shot at Hudson.... Damn Raiders. Wis is still a good-young center, though and a vast upgrade over Wells. I'd love to see him signed and Barksdale retained at this point."
StLouisRams,2yjup4,The_Wayward,2,Tue Mar 10 13:21:04 2015 UTC,Hudson would have just been too expensive for us.

StLouisRams,2yjup4,The_Wayward,2,Tue Mar 10 15:12:16 2015 UTC,They made him the highest paid C in the league!
StLouisRams,2yjup4,ismizz,2,Tue Mar 10 16:34:12 2015 UTC,The downside of the ever expanding cap when you don't have any space. A lot of people will end up with the highest paid contracts of all time just due to the influx of new cash.
StLouisRams,2yjup4,The_Wayward,10,Tue Mar 10 16:51:58 2015 UTC,"I could see around 5-6.5 million a year. That puts him in the like 5-8 range for highest paid centers. Blalock should go in the 4-5.5 range so we could sign our new center and guard for the savings from Long and Wells leaving us around 12-13 million in cap space. Britt should take another 3-4 million of that another millionish for Harkey and a rotational DT. That would take us down to around 5-6 million which might be enough for the draft class. Looks like quick math suggests a couple more cuts coming. Maybe Givens, Pead or one of our backup DE's."
StLouisRams,2yjup4,bozo7337,5,Tue Mar 10 13:15:17 2015 UTC,I'd be a lot happier if we kept Barksdale instead of pursuing Blalock.
StLouisRams,2yjup4,ismizz,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:39:10 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the thought process is that we will pick either Wis or Barksdale and still sign Blalock. No chance we get Wis and Barksdale though without restructuring Sam. Sadly we need another QB to get any leverage on Sam and we likely won't get one of those until draft day, whether it's Foles or a rook.  Edit: WE ARE RICH PEOPLE NOW SIGN ALL THE LINEMAN"

StLouisRams,2yjup4,TweetPoster,1 point,Tue Mar 10 12:24:45 2015 UTC,I have to see tape on him before I start banging the table for him  but I just hope whoever we sign works out for us
StLouisRams,2ym0y0,adamd28,10,Tue Mar 10 22:30:21 2015 UTC,I feel bad for him honestly. He has so much potential and looked to be hitting his stride finally. We'll never get to see what he's capable of in blue and yellow.
StLouisRams,2ym0y0,bwc_28,5,Tue Mar 10 22:47:00 2015 UTC,"""What if?""  What if we gave him halfway decent receivers and an o-line not made out of turnstiles his first 2 years?  What if he didn't have 2 freak injuries in back-to-back years?  That being said, I love the guy, and I hope he tears up the league next year (until the NFC Championship, when the Rams beat the Eagles)"
StLouisRams,2ym0y0,ThirdTimesAnAlt,5,Tue Mar 10 23:31:02 2015 UTC,I'll try not to.
StLouisRams,2ym0y0,Mace_Windu_is_Black,3,Tue Mar 10 22:40:47 2015 UTC,Appreciate that he did what he could with what little we provided to him when he was healthy. Wish him the best in Philly.
StLouisRams,2ym0y0,McRioT,3,Tue Mar 10 22:46:22 2015 UTC,"Will this stop the whole ""next year we will be scary"" shit? The Bradford area will be the years where we had the potential, but were dealt a shitty hand."
StLouisRams,2ym0y0,ImKingDuff,3,Tue Mar 10 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"I'll just think of the countless arguments I had with friends, family, and ANYONE who knew I'm a rams fan. Spent so much time defending him. I loved Sam and hope he kills it in Philly."
StLouisRams,2ym0y0,johnahoe,3,Tue Mar 10 23:28:19 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate that he was consistently injured, but he's been paid about a million dollars per start. I'd have supported him if he'd restructured and stayed. I'm glad to have the cap space, glad for the draft pick, and excited about Foles. Sure, we can say it's sad because what if, but his family is set for generations with that monster rookie contract."
StLouisRams,2ym0y0,Wuiji,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:37:39 2015 UTC,"That's basically how I feel. I thought he was pretty good when he was healthy and pre-Schotty. His play action passes were great. Then he kept getting injured and was happy to keep taking what was effectively an extortionate wage. Had he restructured to help out the team that has stuck by him, I'd have been looking forward to seeing him play for us this season.  As it stands, I wish him all the best and hope he can stay healthy. It'll be nice to see him fulfil some of that potential, but I'm glad he's not here taking up all that cap room."

StLouisRams,2ym0y0,wowbagger88,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:49:53 2015 UTC,"Hype and hope not realized. I felt bad for him, but it drove me crazy watching Austin Davis come in the past two preseasons and bring excitement after Bradford had gotten done with his short passes. Honestly, I'm a bit glad it's over. But if the Rams were given the option, I'd want them to pick up 2010 Sam Bradford again. Hopefully they'd do it right the second time.  I think Bradford getting a change of scenery will be great for him. Someone who actually knows how to run an offense could build him back up."
StLouisRams,2ym0y0,Nautster,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:58:48 2015 UTC,I wanted this to work out so bad. I like the kid. If he didn't want to restructure then it's time to say goodbye. Hope he kills it in Philly and proves all his critics wrong.
StLouisRams,2ym0y0,Wuiji,-1,Wed Mar 11 06:03:42 2015 UTC,Just like Bradford. With a walking stick.
StLouisRams,2yllg0,diesel321,8,Tue Mar 10 20:39:14 2015 UTC,That would be so awesome that you can count on it never happening.

StLouisRams,2yllg0,jjangness,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:40:15 2015 UTC,All the good offensive linemen are pretty much signed. I wish we could have gotten Iupati or Bulaga but too late. Where else are we going to spend the money?
StLouisRams,2yllg0,jjangness,3,Tue Mar 10 20:41:20 2015 UTC,stephen wisniewski for sure. He is number 1 center in this year's FA market. There are still good guards and tackles available.
StLouisRams,2yllg0,jjangness,0,Tue Mar 10 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, but how much will he cost? I think we can afford him along with Revis.   Some are saying Rams swapped first overall picks and gave a conditional in 2016. If that's the case, then they better have big plans for the freed cap space. I think that is just as important as acquiring Foles"
StLouisRams,2yllg0,vrock627,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:46:59 2015 UTC,"IF Revis stayed with Patriots for this season without being released, he would have cost 25 M cap space, and that would basically fill almost every cap we have."
StLouisRams,2yllg0,mlasn,2,Tue Mar 10 20:53:07 2015 UTC,LOL we wouldnt have to pay him 25 mil
StLouisRams,2ym6f8,pleasexplain,3,Tue Mar 10 23:11:05 2015 UTC,"The 2nd round pick is ours no matter what now, according to Schefter."
StLouisRams,2ym6f8,bnsaluki,2,Tue Mar 10 23:17:10 2015 UTC,Yes. We get their 4th this year and possibly 2nd next year if he starts at least 8 games this year. Now everyone is concerned because Chip might be using Bradford as trade-bait to get Mariota so we wouldn't receive their 2016 2nd rounder. But the contract might just say he needs to start 8 games regardless of the team.  EDIT: Forget everything I just wrote. We get the pick guaranteed. https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/575433870532812800

StLouisRams,2ymdyc,RustyShakleford1,8,Wed Mar 11 00:09:28 2015 UTC,I think close to nothing. Seemed more of a keep or cut scenario because of how much he is due.
StLouisRams,2ymdyc,mlasn,7,Wed Mar 11 00:11:52 2015 UTC,Nobody thought we would get this much. Personally I thought the most we would get is a third rounder. Not a future second and a starting QB
StLouisRams,2ymdyc,DabDastic,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"if he leaves philly after this year and signs elsewhere, Philly may get a compensatory pick after 3rd or 4th rd... so that kind of helps hedge bet, as a philly fan"
StLouisRams,2ymdyc,Allthewaylive215,2,Wed Mar 11 04:47:15 2015 UTC,"I've never even considered that, seems to make the trade a little more fair and adds extra insurance."
StLouisRams,2ymdyc,DabDastic,3,Wed Mar 11 04:59:05 2015 UTC,3rd rounder at best perhaps.
StLouisRams,2ymdyc,ClitorisNigga,2,Wed Mar 11 00:14:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I thought he would be impossible to trade because of his huge salary, only one year remaining, injury history, and that even at his best, he's basically average."
StLouisRams,2ymdyc,DiscoJer,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:41:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I think his value to another team is higher than what his value was to us.  He was due so much and didn't want a necessary STL paycut, so it looked like we might just cut him based on that alone.   Regardless, I think it's impossible to have judged his trade value anywhere above a 3rd or 4th round pick based on his inability to stay healthy.  However, I still think he can be a good QB."
StLouisRams,2ymdyc,adamlikescheetos,1 point,Wed Mar 11 01:22:46 2015 UTC,"I have to wonder if he got traded because he wouldn't take the pay cut OR if he was asked to take a pay cut because he would be more valuable to trade.  I expected him to be out and out cut, this was a shock."
StLouisRams,2yl3mn,Shonuff88,2,Tue Mar 10 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"I like Kendricks, but he doesn't really have a place on the Rams offense.  He is solid at both receiving and blocking, but Jared Cook is a better receiver and Cory Harkey is a better blocker."
StLouisRams,2yl3mn,nhuff90,3,Tue Mar 10 19:46:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, he's really taken some positive steps in his game the last year or two but he's likely to get more money than he should get from the Rams in free agency. Not only do we have Cook and we have matching rights to Harkey but Cunningham and Bayer showed promise last year in limited action."

Decent guy, too. Quiet, but knows he can play in the NFL.I hope he does well for the Rams. Can Bradford deal with the sports radio and media here? It can be brutal."

StLouisRams,2ylj7r,tyjack,2,Tue Mar 10 20:27:40 2015 UTC,"From our end we've seen it more trading up to the Jets at 6. Reports were out saying they liked Bradford over taking a shot in the 1st at Winston/Mariota/Hundley/etc, could see us restructuring Bradford then shipping him and #10 to the Jets for Mariota. Would be a hell of a coup if we did that, effectively would only cost us Foles to move from #20 to #6 and we'd come out with a conditional pick next year."

StLouisRams,2yhsvy,chemicalpoisons,5,Mon Mar 9 23:23:30 2015 UTC,Giving up multiple first round picks(What it would take to move up into Mariota territory) is a terrible terrible idea unless its for a someone like Luck.
StLouisRams,2yhsvy,Kaos047,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:24:29 2015 UTC,Especially for a kid like Mariota who took essentially zero snaps under center and didn't have to make any reads in college. That would be a massive risk.

But you can't win without a QB. Whether or not you get the right QB, you have to try to get someone. Whether that be Bradford in 2010, or RG3 in 2012 by the Redskins, or Mariota by (?) this year, it's always worth a try if you have a need, regardless if it ultimately works out."

The raiders have been good like once in the past 25 years and that year 2002, the niners won the NFC west. So when exactly was there a time when niner fans bandwagoned over to the raiders cause the raiders were so good and the niners sucked? Early 80's?"
StLouisRams,2yg3bx,codesius,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:08:47 2015 UTC,"1) Earth 2) 2002 is exactly the last time they routed for the raiders. Then the niners started to get good again and they migrated back over. The niners are now imploding, so if the raiders are anywhere near decent here soon they will own the bay once again. Have you been to the bay area? Same phenomenon in baseball. While the As were having their stretch in the beginning of the year more As hats began appearing. When the Giants started getting hot and making a playoff run more SF hats began appearing. Unless you walk around with your eyes closed it's pretty easy to see."

StLouisRams,2ygkh1,SMH_35,12,Mon Mar 9 17:22:12 2015 UTC,ugh...this makes me super nervous I think we're  going to give way too much for Foles
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,SMH_35,2,Mon Mar 9 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"In your eyes, what is the least the Rams could give up... that you would be mad about?"
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,mbsob,2,Mon Mar 9 17:25:41 2015 UTC,If we swapped our 1st rounder (10) for their 1st rounder (20) and gave up a mid round future pick I would be okay with it. But I don't think we can give up any more picks from this year. Not sure what the going rate would be though.
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,mlasn,-2,Mon Mar 9 17:29:12 2015 UTC,"Foles is not worth anything close to that. Moving from 20 to 10 would probably cost a first rounder minimum and no way I would pay a first and mid rounder for Foles,"
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,Trollfailbot,8,Mon Mar 9 21:01:01 2015 UTC,no way I would pay a first and mid rounder for Foles   What?  You'd be paying a first and a mid rounder for Foles and a first.

Now give up that 4th and a 6th for Barron isn't looking that great after all"
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,captain65,-5,Mon Mar 9 17:32:57 2015 UTC,Giving up our first for Foles straight up no swapping picks.

StLouisRams,2ygkh1,Ihateunerds,4,Mon Mar 9 20:33:48 2015 UTC,Oh lord just a FYI the eagles would literally laugh their ass off and hang up at that deal I literally thought this was a joke. This deal is not going down without the Eagles having the #10 pick by the time its all said and done.
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,bretris,4,Mon Mar 9 21:14:54 2015 UTC,you think anyones giving a top-10 pick for Nick Foles?  Cmon man
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,DabDastic,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:47:56 2015 UTC,"Not giving up but swapping firsts plus a little more from us.  The only way it could work is if the Eagles have another trade in the works to move up for Mariota, which they would need the tenth pick for."
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,BrawndoTTM,2,Tue Mar 10 05:25:08 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. Stacey's a good player and should be worth at least something to a team that lacks RB depth or just needs a third down back.
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,IRBillsfan,2,Mon Mar 9 20:47:22 2015 UTC,If we could snag him and flip Bradford for a second to maybe the bills Id be all for that.
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,BrawndoTTM,6,Mon Mar 9 17:55:16 2015 UTC,No one will pay anything for Bradford at his current contract.

StLouisRams,2ygkh1,TheeVande,3,Tue Mar 10 03:10:34 2015 UTC,Do you guys think if this happens there'll be a three way trade with Bradford to another team as well? I think Bradford and Foles are both too good to be potentially sitting behind one another on the same team.
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,Ihateunerds,4,Mon Mar 9 19:18:35 2015 UTC,"It would be hard to get enough in a trade for Bradford to be worth it with his 13 million cap hit. I would think the Rams keep both and put them in a competition for the starting spot. If Bradford wins, we need a starting caliber backup behind him with his injury history."
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,TheeVande,1 point,Mon Mar 9 19:46:03 2015 UTC,If only Bradford was opened to being traded somewhere and not just cut.
StLouisRams,2ygkh1,Ihateunerds,2,Tue Mar 10 15:06:13 2015 UTC,"That would require one of the other 31 GMs in football to be crazy enough to not only pay a guy who has missed 25 consecutive games $13 million next year, but also give up something of value in return. The only time deals like that ever happen is when teams swap one bad contract for another. Bradford is untradeable, unless we are trading him for someone else's problem."

In fact take out the one Raiders game where they unnecessarily ran up the score inflating Foles numbers than his season isn't any more special than Bradfords best season."

I think Foles has a decent upside--not as high as Bradford's, but significantly less risky, and far cheaper.  If he works out, fine.  If not...we'll move on.    There's no immediate help at QB coming from the draft this year...neither of the 2 star QB's will be there by the time we get to pick, and trading up will cost far too much.  Other QB's in the draft (Petty, Hundley, etc...) will take to long to develop for a team that's got a top-notch defense, decent RBs, and a budding-but-talented group of WRs.

Two billionaires, formerly friends and now enemies, fighting each other in public. Better than reality TV. Real House Builders of Beverly Hills?"
StLouisRams,2yh8lr,bozo7337,3,Tue Mar 10 19:07:09 2015 UTC,"With a toupe` manufacturer as the shows sponsor! But yeah these ""studies"" questioning the Inglewood project are comedy. IIRC the guy who wrote the homeland security issue was also govenor of Pennsylvania. When he was the govenor he helped to build a stadium there that's closer to an airport than the Inglewood project would be."

Not sure which stadium in PA you're referring, but I'm not surprised to read what you wrote. LAX is by nature different from either PIT or PHL, but a target is a target, and I'm not sure if it would pass there today.   Meanwhile, this is turning into a full-on vendetta between these two, and I'm excited to watch these guys beat each other up. And all I can think of for a show sponsor is this guy!"

StLouisRams,2yh8lr,TheDuke13,2,Thu Mar 12 01:02:10 2015 UTC,This changes everything
StLouisRams,2yh8lr,Seductive_Santa,8,Thu Mar 12 13:16:45 2015 UTC,When and if it passes is when it's a big deal. It would give power to a legislature that doesn't seem willing to finance a stadium.
StLouisRams,2yh8lr,The_Wayward,3,Thu Mar 12 23:40:03 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly torn on this. As a Rams fan, I don't like it at all. Muddies the waters and makes it harder to move forward on the stadium. As a taxpayer and citizen however, I don't think the governor should have the ability to extend financial obligations throughout the state without the approval of the legislature.   Checks and Balances and shit are important."
StLouisRams,2yh8lr,SoulardSTL,5,Fri Mar 13 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"Two valid points I hope we all consider... Same time, a lot of what's going on with Rep. Silvey is his working to make a name for himself within the party by going eye to eye with the other party's governor. He wants to be remembered once his term limits are reached. Personally, I've spent time as a political consultant, and I view this bill moving past committee as little more than procedural. So long as the New Riverfront Stadium can demonstrate positive ROI above any State allocations, has the support of the business community, and in the process keep a major national business headquartered in the State, then I would think many in the GOP wouldn't go totally objectivist. Add-in that Nixon's a lame duck, so he's not worried of things bouncing back on him any more."

StLouisRams,2yh8lr,DabDastic,3,Thu Mar 12 18:28:06 2015 UTC,"Does anybody else feel that the relocation threat is going to make it hard to convince someone to sign with us? Like ""Okay yeah we'll give you the contract you want but you'll move to St. Louis this year with your family, and then maybe next year you'll uproot everything again and go to LA."" If I was a free agent the Rams would not be on the top of the list for this reason alone. I just want this relocation shit to end. I want them in St. Louis more then anything, but I also just want all of this to be over with."
StLouisRams,2yh8lr,DeniseDeNephew,9,Mon Mar 9 20:23:07 2015 UTC,"It might be a factor in attracting free agents, we don't know what is in their heads, but this seems pretty unlikely.  You're talking about a non-football factor, let's look at a few others as well as a few football-related factors.  Football related:   The team's terrible record for over a decade.  Nobody is coming here to make a last run at a SB ring, they go to places like New England for that.   The team's uncertainty at QB.  Do free agent WRs want to risk seeing Sam Bradford go down again and spend a year or more being thrown to by Shaun Hill or some future rookie? Coach Fisher.  He's known as a player's coach which could be a positive, but as people here are quick to point out, he's a career .500 coach -- is that the guy a star player wants to play for? A poor offensive line.  If Barksdale leaves then we're left with two solid starters on the OLine, Robinson and Saffold (let's be optimistic and assume Saffold stays healthy).  Some people may think that we'll be able to restock the line through free agency and the draft but players may be more realistic.  It's generally agreed  that offensive lines perform better the longer they've been together so what can we expect with three new guys?  Our biggest needs are on offense and our line is going to drag down the entire offense's production.  Is that a situation that free agents on offense want to walk into? We're in the NFC West.  This is not an easy division to win and if a free agent expects to make the playoffs or make a Super Bowl run they may either want to choose another team in the NFCW or go to another division altogether. A new OC.  None of us know how good or bad Cignetti will be because he is an unknown.  Most of the guys we'll pursue will be on offense -- will they want to play for a first-time Offensive Coordinator?   Non-football related:   A possible move to LA.  This could be a factor but it's hard to imagine many young male millionaires who would not like to live in Los Angeles.  Moving after a year is inconvenient but that's reality in the NFL.  Still, it could be a factor for some.   The weather.  Say what you want about having 4 seasons and loving snow but there's a reason that resorts are in warm-weather areas, and that while there are Alaska cruises there are many, many more Caribbean cruises.  In general people prefer warm weather and for some this will be a quality-of-life factor. TV time.  The Rams are almost never on national TV.  The national media rarely talks about them and it's not uncommon to only see a single play or two on ESPN for the week's highlights.  Some guys may want to ""fly under the radar"" but we see enough elaborate sack dances and touchdown celebrations to know that plenty of guys want as much air time as possible, and they're not going to get that here.   Possible endorsements.  It goes without saying that a star athlete in LA would have more opportunities for endorsements than a star athlete in St. Louis.   The recent report about the Ferguson PD.  Ferguson is not St. Louis but it's what, 10 miles away?  It would be disingenuous to claim that the racism and corruption that exists in Ferguson does not exist in St. Louis.  How many black free agents see that as a negative?  You talked about the inconvenience of moving a family, how about raising a family where the police department targets your kids because of the color of their skin?   Most free agents we'll be pursuing are too young to remember Rodney King but the rampant racism in Ferguson was revealed just a few days ago.   My point is that there are many reasons why our team is not a dream destination for many (most?) free agents.  The relocation may be one but I don't think it is a major factor.   A better question may be what makes our team attractive?   A strong defense?  The chance to start (not even sure this is a factor for the kind of FAs you're talking about who will start anywhere they go)?    What else?   I think we're in a position where money will have to do the talking."
StLouisRams,2yh8lr,StraightfromSTL,4,Mon Mar 9 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"Most pro athletes live where they want to live anyway. There are a few guys in town like Matt Holliday and maybe a couple other guys who actually plant deep roots, but the most just go back to their hometowns during the offseason"
StLouisRams,2yh8lr,bwc_28,4,Tue Mar 10 14:21:22 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling the prospect of possibly playing in LA would be a plus for a lot of players. When they were in LA before there were players who were interested simply because LA was so close to Hollywood. The threat of relocation might be off-putting to some, but the location of the move might also be tantalizing to others. If anything I'd guess it'd be a wash."

StLouisRams,2yi380,AyoJake,7,Tue Mar 10 10:54:48 2015 UTC,"yes.  we've been saying ""if we use tavon correctly"" since he entered the league. sorry, but this 1st round, traded up for pick we got, should be able to make some impact in any scheme and not in a specific, narrow way that purely suits his ability.  you can blame QB play and schotty, but point is, he's not worth it.  you're basically saying you'd rather keep a specific-role-player than a QB (the position where we have a HUGE question mark at btw) who has showed he can do some damage.  I'm taking this trade 10 out of 10 times"
StLouisRams,2yi380,Chuy_3,3,Tue Mar 10 05:18:09 2015 UTC,"Ya I'm really surprised no one else likes this trade.  We would still have Britt and Quick.  The draft is fairly deep at WR so we could get something late or even an UDFA.    I want Bradford to succeed as much as the next guy, but Foles would be a huge step up from Davis and whatever rookie QB we draft.   I really like Tavon and wish he would have been better used, but at the end of the day a low-end starting QB is much more valuable than a #3 WR"
StLouisRams,2yi380,tylerseher,3,Tue Mar 10 14:36:07 2015 UTC,"Agree, I would do this trade easily. Though I wasn't high on him when we drafted him either. It allows us to keep #10 and we could spend that pick on Cooper or White."

StLouisRams,2yecmm,porkfish66,1 point,Mon Mar 9 14:52:41 2015 UTC,He played and started 15 games last season. He has started 125 of 128 games in his NFL career. Hardly an injury concern. The one game he missed last year was week 5. I agree with the 31 comment but this guy has had no real injury concerns. He's a perfect fit four our power blocking scheme.

StLouisRams,2y7ikp,bretris,15,Sat Mar 7 03:42:44 2015 UTC,Need Harkey back.   McCleod is a boomer who has been under-appreciated.   Meh on Austin Davis.
StLouisRams,2y7ikp,Bskrilla,5,Sat Mar 7 06:39:32 2015 UTC,Yep. No surprises here really. You need a 3rd QB too so might as well be a guy with some experience who knows the system though.
StLouisRams,2y7ikp,Ihateunerds,2,Sat Mar 7 08:36:47 2015 UTC,"Davis wasn't all that bad, I'm glad he got experience. People on this sub act like we should scoff at him as one of our dudes under center. He won several games for us. He balled out of control against the Seahawks going 18 of 21.  They were all short passes and ya know, in a game like the super bowl *you could never win using short passes against the best defense in the league."" Im just saying he went 3-5; lost to the Chiefs, 49ers, cards, Cowboys, and Eagles. He beat the Bucs, Seahawks and 49ers.    Shaun Hill in his 9 games and 8 starts this year posted a 63.3 completion rating,  8TDs-7ints, while fumbling 7 times and losing it once, he was sacked 18 x. We won 3 and lost 5.  Coincidently AD also started 8 games and played in 9, he posted 63.4 completion rating on 2001 yards, went 12 TD on 9ints.  5 fumbles lost 3,  sacked 29x.  We won 3 lost 5.   The game that benched davis was the cards, again coincidently Shaun  Hill's worst game was against the cards, he posted s 51.3 completion rating."
StLouisRams,2y7ikp,corbilm,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"I was at the Cowboys game when Davis was starting, he was lighting their defense up. Some of the throws he was making were just dead on. Almost looked like they were back in the Greatest show on turf days...then the second half came around haha. I hope he can get coached up some more and maybe he will improve."
StLouisRams,2y7ikp,sweeps28,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:19:08 2015 UTC,Very fair points on AD and to think. the Eagles and Cowboys should of been wins. Davis doesn't have the best arm and I think that's his only problem.
StLouisRams,2y7ikp,PRE_-CISION-_,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:37:12 2015 UTC,I'm less than meh on Davis. he was fine I guess but $1.5m is more than I wanna pay for him.

StLouisRams,2y7ikp,JahMakeYa,7,Sat Mar 7 13:48:06 2015 UTC,"Harkey's a beast, match any offer.  He's top shelf in my book.  McLeod and Davis.... mmmmm beer in a can, like Busch.  But in all fairness Id bring Davis back as a 3rd string."
StLouisRams,2y7ikp,ITameFatGirls,15,Sat Mar 7 06:15:02 2015 UTC,"McLeod has made leaps of improvement each year so far of his career. He was a good special teamer his rookie year, then was a poor safety/decent slot corner his 2nd year to being at least an average starter in his third year. If he can make one more leap this off season I think we'll have an intimidating and young safety duo."
StLouisRams,2y7ikp,frankoftank,0,Sat Mar 7 07:30:11 2015 UTC,"I respect the opinion, but McLeod absolutely sucks in coverage.  TJ is our SS, since the Bronco gsme he's been playing lights out.  McLeod in coverage is tough to watch, he's been asked to play a position he can't play.  I respect the guy, but he doesn't belong as a starter on a team.  Solid depth guy, nothing else"

StLouisRams,2y7ikp,chemicalpoisons,1 point,Sat Mar 7 17:43:56 2015 UTC,"No question about Harkey and McLeod, they offer the team much help when they need it. As for Davis, I can't say, I am too emotionally invested to the guy to let him go. I'll never forget those wondrous plays he made against Seattle."
StLouisRams,2y6jbe,Shonuff88,8,Fri Mar 6 22:10:10 2015 UTC,I read somewhere he was looking for around 7 million a year. If that is his price range then let him walk.
StLouisRams,2y6jbe,bozo7337,2,Sat Mar 7 00:17:12 2015 UTC,"I saw that too, that's the highest any RT made this year.  Barksdale is OK, really regressed towards the end of the year and that Redskin game..... He was worse than Joseph.  If he comes cheap less than 4.5 million Im all for bringing him back, otherwise I really like Parnell in FA."
StLouisRams,2y6jbe,ITameFatGirls,4,Sat Mar 7 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"I hope they resign him.  After seeing FAs like Jason Brown, Scott Wells, and Jake Long brought in for big money and then underperforming I am skeptical that we can fix the Oline through free agency.  Barksdale was a rare ""hit"" for us, we claimed him off waivers, and resigning him seems safer than rolling the dice with someone else.    How many holes can we count on filling through the draft?   Snead is not going to hit on every pick so how many quality Day 1 starters on the OL can we realistically expect to draft?  One?  Two?   I'd be very happy with one and ecstatic if we got two.  But all the opinions you read that make it all sound so easy, ""Cut Long and Barksdale, sign 2 starters in FA, and then trade down and draft 2 more starters (and a franchise QB) and then we're set"" just seem so crazy.  We already have more holes than we can probably fill so we should make resigning Barksdale and Britt something of a priority -- and if I had to put money on it I'd bet that Snead is doing exactly that.  They obviously can't break the bank on these guys but I will feel much more comfortable heading into free agency and the draft with both resigned."
StLouisRams,2y6jbe,DeniseDeNephew,2,Fri Mar 6 23:27:44 2015 UTC,I totally hear what you guys are saying about creating more holes if we don't resign him but he is not an elite tackle to back the dump truck full of money  IMO. If we gave him what he wanted we would be paying him out of fear rather them him being an ok tackle and the Rams can't afford to be stuck with a bad contract for an ok player.
StLouisRams,2y6jbe,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Fri Mar 6 23:53:37 2015 UTC,"he is not an elite tackle to back the dump truck full of money   Well sure -- if Snead thought he was worth a huge contract he'd already be resigned.  I don't think we disagree much on Barksdale.  Like any player in a salary-capped sport you can't afford to overpay him, my point was really that people talk about replacing starters as if it is easy, that you can find solid starters with any mid- or late-round pick, and that's complete fantasy.  If we could rely on drafting starting offensive linemen with middle and late round picks then we'd never have any weaknesses on the OLine but look where we're at.  Hell, Robinson wasn't a Day 1 starter and he was the #2 pick so how do people think we can count on getting starting OL with a late round pick?  It isn't impossible of course but Snead isn't a miracle worker."

StLouisRams,2y6jbe,Wm_TheConqueror,1 point,Sat Mar 7 03:41:28 2015 UTC,At first I thought I would have a problem with this but after giving it some thought I wouldn't feel bad letting him go. Yes the Rams O-line isn't the best but I'm sure this draft will finally address this need at get some good O-line help because let's face it we don't have the cap room to go crazy.
StLouisRams,2y6jbe,Wm_TheConqueror,2,Fri Mar 6 22:27:56 2015 UTC,"I would've like to resign him, because we do have other needs to address that could push us over the hump. Even if we draft a lot of O-line we will still likely be thin."
StLouisRams,2y6jbe,Maverick814,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:32:01 2015 UTC,True but if this is guy is asking for more than the Rams can offer given the cap situation then let him walk IMO.

StLouisRams,2y6jbe,iamlogan,5,Fri Mar 6 23:19:11 2015 UTC,I don't think the draft is weak at oline at all. I think it's wisely viewed as one of the deepest positions in the draft

StLouisRams,2y68hb,To3z,10,Fri Mar 6 20:43:26 2015 UTC,"Why would Bradford want that when he can get all of it with little to no risk of being cut this year.  Contracts, unlike MLB or NBA, aren't guareented, we see teams cut players all the time do to injury issues or performance, players losing out on a lot of dough.  How often does a player that signs a massive deal actually make it to the end of it. ( this off-season alone Andre Johnson, Brandon Marshall woulda been released if no trade, Cary Williams, Chris Meyers, Trent Cole, many other cap casualties)  It's a tough sell to a player to take one for the team (your example) when teams usually won't heistate to cut you once they believe you aren't worth it."
StLouisRams,2y68hb,ITameFatGirls,2,Fri Mar 6 21:15:08 2015 UTC,Can The money be converted to a signing bonus so tht it comes off of the cap?
StLouisRams,2y68hb,Soaring_Seagull,2,Sat Mar 7 00:59:04 2015 UTC,"Yes you could, the signing bonus' are prorated so he'd have to sign on for a minimum/additional one more year, which honestly I'm not too sure I personally would want to do.  I like Bradford, but we don't know if he can stay healthy or play at a high level consistently.  I don't want to end up in a similar position next off-season if it turns out he's not the guy.  The Bradford debate bust or starter will finally be put to rest by the end of this year."
StLouisRams,2y68hb,ITameFatGirls,3,Sat Mar 7 01:53:27 2015 UTC,Really the debate is already over but I guess people are still hanging on.
StLouisRams,2y68hb,suburban_robot,1 point,Sat Mar 7 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"Bust relative to number 1 overall pick Im with you, total bust who cannot be a starter though, I'm going to wait one more year :)"
StLouisRams,2y68hb,ITameFatGirls,2,Sat Mar 7 03:04:58 2015 UTC,We should probably just pony up the cash. We could easily cut long and wells if we wanted another 20 million in cap. It seems like Bradford taking a paycut would be more for the sake of the rams justifying their sticking with him than anything. You've stated that he is your guy so you might as well see him through with faith I guess.
StLouisRams,2y68hb,Soaring_Seagull,7,Sat Mar 7 02:35:31 2015 UTC,I think all players should have incentive based contracts. It's not fair if they don't produce.

StLouisRams,2y68hb,nufandan,9,Sun Mar 8 19:01:57 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if that's the type of restructure that his agent is refusing now.  It would be fair for the team but risky for Bradford.
StLouisRams,2y68hb,D9-EM,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:59:18 2015 UTC,Would any team even offer anything close to what the Rams are offering?
StLouisRams,2y68hb,vinniedamac,2,Fri Mar 6 22:39:33 2015 UTC,"It's possible actually. This free agent class is really weak at QB, Bradford is considered the best QB from what I've read. That doesn't mean he should get paid that much, but teams are often more than willing to overpay for a QB."
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,Shonuff88,12,Fri Mar 6 04:09:38 2015 UTC,"Then trade for Foles, draft Hundley and sign Foles to a front loaded 3 year extension and let Sam walk after next year."
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,bozo7337,5,Fri Mar 6 04:15:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, but instead of Hundley. Draft Garrett Grayson. He came from a pro style offense has a cannon for a right arm, has good accuracy, and has pocket awareness. Hundley has no pocket awareness, loses touch on passes, not from a pro style offense, looks for first read and if it isn't there he runs."
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,TacoxOFxBell,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:32:30 2015 UTC,I also prefer Grayson and even Petty. Just used Hundley as an example.
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,bozo7337,2,Fri Mar 6 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I would take Petty as well, but Grayson is still the number 3 QB in this draft class."
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,TacoxOFxBell,1 point,Fri Mar 6 17:36:34 2015 UTC,Hundley just isnt that good. There are 2-3 other guys id draft before him. You cant teach accuracy.
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,Graybealz,3,Fri Mar 6 16:25:22 2015 UTC,I'm not a big Hundley fan either but his accuracy gets criticized a lot and he was fourth in completion percentage last year at 69%. I think he pocket progression and read progression are the worries.
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,bozo7337,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:44:14 2015 UTC,college accuracy means literally nothing. Look at Tebow. 67%

StLouisRams,2y3qmn,Ihateunerds,3,Fri Mar 6 14:37:44 2015 UTC,We're at about 10 million right now and could easily clear another 10 without cutting Sam. Cutting Sam will more than pay for Foles and any 2 or 3 year extension.
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,bozo7337,9,Fri Mar 6 14:57:06 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. I've been pro-Bradford and have supported him even through his two ACL tears but in order to make the big bucks you need to prove yourself worthy.
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,iWag,4,Fri Mar 6 05:20:28 2015 UTC,Manning just took a damn pay cut for the Broncos and transferred it into incentives. The fact that Bradford is unwilling to do the same has me a little angry. Angry enough I say cut him if he doesnt work with the team.
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,Kaos047,2,Fri Mar 6 16:05:21 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I would be okay with a compromise of an extension with it being very incentive heavy like Kaeps deal.
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,Kaos047,17,Fri Mar 6 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, losing a lot of respect for Bradford over all this. I understand Condon is his agent, but he's going to do whatever Bradford tells him to. Bottom line is Bradford is trying to take advantage of the team that's had his back through all his ridiculous injuries. I'm about ready say cut him loose."
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,bwc_28,5,Fri Mar 6 21:40:27 2015 UTC,"come on. you'd do the same. He's being smart. his career is in jeopardy and he's one knee injury away from retirement potentially so why would he take less, lose guaranteed money and accept that risk? thats stupidity"
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,zaviex,2,Fri Mar 6 21:57:41 2015 UTC,He's being financially tactical at the expense of the team that has consistently supported him and already has grossly overpaid for him. This is the year he has to start giving back and that starts with a pay cut. If he can play well during his contract year he can make serious money at the end of this season. What this tells me is that he has no confidence in his ability to stay healthy which means the team shouldn't be forced to overpay. The only reason he is getting away with this is because of the QB draft class and we all know it.   edit: a word
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,undead_tortoise,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:08:12 2015 UTC,"Nope, if I had $50 million in the bank I definitely wouldn't. Especially after only playing 1/3 of the games I was paid for. And I've said so in this subreddit before while defending Bradford as well."
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,bwc_28,1 point,Sun Mar 8 09:06:50 2015 UTC,completely agree. I don't think people can truly empathize with him. Noone knows how tough it is to turn down millions of dollars. And all these comparisons to Peyton Manning? That dude has fuck you money. Bradford has money. You can't really compare them financially.
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,Sam_the_Ram,3,Sun Mar 8 23:28:22 2015 UTC,They know the Rams have no other options and are gambling on the fact they won't cut his ass. It would be a ballsy move by the F.O. to cut him and try to resign him. His agent damn well knows he won't get any decent money guaranteed by another team with 2 ACL injuries.
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,NinjaChemist,4,Mon Mar 9 04:15:02 2015 UTC,"""The rams have one 18 games with Sam Bradford"". Wow."

That division record really makes me wish he was healthy for 3 full seasons since the Stache came to town."
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,bozo7337,3,Fri Mar 6 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"It's just all sad. His potential (possibly) going untapped, the injuries, the incompetency of the regime that drafted him, the EIGHTEEN victories he's amassed since 2010, his reluctance to take a team friendly cut. My god"

StLouisRams,2y3qmn,essayerdenouveau,5,Fri Mar 6 05:39:36 2015 UTC,"Too much hating on Bradford in this thread. You guys really expect Bradford to give up millions of his own dollars just because of some kind of ""goodwill"" between them? No. He's trying to make as much money as he can because this game doesn't last forever. With the way he's getting injured, he might not have long left. Why wouldn't he take as much as he can? It's a business, and he has no incentive to lose money. The cap experts at Rams HQ can make it work, that's their job. Bradford's job is to play QB and he wants to be paid accordingly. Why take a paycut when you don't have to?"
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,Yji,7,Fri Mar 6 06:23:40 2015 UTC,"He's trying to make as much money as he can because this game doesn't last forever.    Hes already made more than 99.99% of all QBs to ever play the game. He has made Elite QB money without proving anything in the league. Manning just took a fucking incentive pay cut, its the least Bradford could do.   Ive been a Bradford supporter since the day he joined this team. I want him back this year because I think he can do well, but if he cant work with a team that has stood behind him for 4 years, thats pretty shitty. Taking a 3 - 4 million pay cut could mean bringing in a tackle/guard to protect him."
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,Kaos047,4,Fri Mar 6 14:16:27 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter how much he's made compared to most, he's still going to want to capitalize on as much money he can get."
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,Yji,2,Fri Mar 6 17:20:54 2015 UTC,"It should matter though. He won the NFL draft lottery by being the last one taken with the absolutely crazy first round contracts. Hes made enough money for him and his children to never have to work again, and still live a life of luxury, all while being an average QB when hes on the field. And he hasnt been on the field much. If he cared about winning and wasn't looking at this season as his last hurrah to make as much money as possible, he would take a pay cut."

He's probably worth at least a hundred million dollars. Bradford is still young, probably wants a family, and knows that if he gets everything he possibly can out of this contract, then he can set up his family for a long long time.

StLouisRams,2y3qmn,suburban_robot,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:15:16 2015 UTC,"If we cut him, he will get something that is at least 2 years and has more than 13 million guaranteed. Why take less to stay?"

StLouisRams,2y3qmn,StraightfromSTL,2,Sat Mar 7 01:31:51 2015 UTC,The rams a re pretty screwed right now. They pretty much have no choice but to keep bradford at his current contract because there is no upgrades in free agency or the draft. Huge loss of respect for sam
StLouisRams,2y3qmn,KingSam2008,1 point,Sat Mar 7 03:18:17 2015 UTC,They're probably trying to re-work the deal so they can trade him more easily to another team. No team is going to bite and offer anything for Bradford with the monster contract he has now and the uncertainty about his ability to stay healthy.
StLouisRams,2y1eha,diesel321,27,Thu Mar 5 17:07:43 2015 UTC,"Did the Rams really need to draft Aaron Donald when our line was already stacked? Nope. But we drafted an impact player, which I think is very important. No QB this round, if we need a QB next year, draft Hackenburg.   Bradford is our QB situation. Hate it, or like it. That's our quarterback this year."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,Vanscoten,7,Thu Mar 5 17:42:50 2015 UTC,"But DLine is different because you can make a difference on your own. But WR only make true differences on good offenses. Unless Cooper is going to block then throw to himself, he will be under-utilized"
StLouisRams,2y1eha,noobiepoobie,7,Thu Mar 5 18:03:38 2015 UTC,Mike Evans had 12 TD's and played extremely well for the bus last year with McCown and Glennon.

StLouisRams,2y1eha,crackalac,13,Thu Mar 5 20:34:19 2015 UTC,"Oh no my point was not how the bucs did, but that WR can make differences on shitty offenses."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,mjp1985,3,Thu Mar 5 20:38:25 2015 UTC,They aren't in year 4 of a rebuild.
StLouisRams,2y1eha,mjp1985,0,Thu Mar 5 20:38:36 2015 UTC,Bucs were bad as a team. Not because they drafted a great wr in the 1st round SMH
StLouisRams,2y1eha,mjp1985,0,Fri Mar 6 00:12:33 2015 UTC,"For them, it might not have been a bad choice because they are in the beginning of the rebuild. But the Rams are a more complete team. Rams are just one or two pieces from being a perennial playoff team. A WR doesn't change that. A WR doesn't win games like a strong line or QB"
StLouisRams,2y1eha,Vanscoten,0,Fri Mar 6 00:21:55 2015 UTC,What qb is there to draft? Winston will surely be gone. Everyone else is a gamble at best. We need another lineman I agree but they can be had throughout the draft. Impact players are what you want in round 1
StLouisRams,2y1eha,jjangness,1 point,Fri Mar 6 00:28:39 2015 UTC,Scherff will have a bigger impact on the Rams than any receiver could
StLouisRams,2y1eha,DeniseDeNephew,-1,Fri Mar 6 00:32:13 2015 UTC,At rt? I doubt that if you have a legit threat on the outside it opens the running game up and the other receivers. You can still get a starter at guard or rt in the middle rounds. If Britt leaves we should definitely consider taking a wr in the first. If he stays then I would be more enthusiastic about a lineman. We still could also sign barksdale so the need for an lineman would significantly decrease if so.;
StLouisRams,2y1eha,Bond_007x,3,Fri Mar 6 00:40:48 2015 UTC,"The point was that we didn't need any defensive line help. We drafted an impact player.   I don't want Cooper honestly, would much rather have White, but that's just me. Kenny Britt (Assuming me resign), Brian Quick, and Kevin White, those would be three receivers at least 6'3"", big targets for any QB. As much as we think we have a good set of receivers, we don't really know. Stedman Bailey showed great promise, Givens has been nothing special, we released Pettis one of our best possession receivers who had done barely anything last year. Tavon Austin, below average player by PFF, not utilized correctly, could get injured easily as starter. It seems like you're not high on Bradford, and that we don't have any QB. Let me tell you, Bradford is our guy this year, for better or worse. He's our best chance. No rookie in the draft is better."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:53:12 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want Hackenberg after how he played this season.
StLouisRams,2y1eha,RamsWillFly,10,Fri Mar 6 04:08:36 2015 UTC,"It all depends on who else is available.  Look at last year's #13 pick.  The Rams wanted OBJ even though WR was not a high priority, but he was taken at 12 so they instead took Aaron Donald, a guy who plays a position that was even less of a need.  Looking at things long-term, wouldn't you take either one of those guys if you could, even though neither was a top need?  The same kind of thing MIGHT happen in this draft.  Most people have DGB going in the 2nd -- what if he lives up to his potential?  A Guard might be a better pick instead of DGB, but not just any Guard.  So it depends on the circumstances.  A WR or LB that Snead has rated very highly might be a better pick than a lineman they have rated lower.  This team doesn't have a lot of impact players or game changers and if they have the opportunity to get one, they should.    As for QB, everyone agrees that we need another, but who?  Winston and Mariota probably won't be there when we pick and everyone else are just guys that you draft and then keep your fingers crossed and hope they exceed expectations.  So do you spend a pick on a low-rated QB who history says is almost surely a wasted draft pick, or pick a less risky player at a different position?  The fan drafts I've seen here have had DGB in the 2nd and a QB in the 3rd -- is there a QB you think is enough of a sure thing you'd take him in the 2nd, knowing that DGB will almost surely be gone by the 3rd?    It is extremely unlikely that we're going to draft a franchise QB this year so why not spend the picks to upgrade other positions?     Britt assuming he stays   This is becoming troublesome.  I advocated resigning him during the season, and after that passed I said that they should get him wrapped up before free agency.  For a while I thought Snead was just dragging his feet but now I have a new theory.  I think they did try to resign Britt, and have probably made a few different offers.  But I think Britt or his agent think they can get more money elsewhere so they have rejected the team's offers.  Snead wants him back but he doesn't want to overpay for him like he did with CLong and JL55 so he's hoping that the market for Britt's talents is not as strong as Britt thinks it is (I hope the same thing).  I could be wrong but it would seem to logically explain the lack of progress in resigning Britt."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,CallOnTyrone,3,Thu Mar 5 18:14:37 2015 UTC,"Just curious, how do you know the Rams wanted OBJ?"

StLouisRams,2y1eha,Soaring_Seagull,4,Tue Mar 10 01:42:35 2015 UTC,"At this point, not really, but I wouldn't be upset if we did pick up someone. I think we have a solid receiving corps, especially if we resign Britt and Quick comes back healthy and playing like he did last year before going down. Depending on how thr free agency signings go and who's still on the board when it's our pick, it'd be hard passing up someone like White or Cooper."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,Cloud324,7,Thu Mar 5 17:28:08 2015 UTC,I admit that I'd rather have oline. I wouldn't mind cooper though (not as sold on white as others). Cooper can be a special guy IMO.
StLouisRams,2y1eha,The_Wayward,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I didn't watch a ton of college this season, but it feels like White has only gotten hyped since his combine results.  Meanwhile, Cooper was consistently rated the top WR prospect all season long.  I can't remember who it was that said it, but someone compared Cooper to Torry Holt and I completely see it.  Cooper may not be the biggest WR, the fastest, the best route runner, or the strongest, but he is really good at all of those."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,BrawndoTTM,2,Fri Mar 6 00:46:24 2015 UTC,"People fall in love with measurables as usual. White had a good season at WVU but I didn't see much separation created through his routes or great athletic ability. Cooper is the smoothest receiver I've ever watched. No wasted movements, clean breaks. I hear Marvin  Harrison a lot which I like"
StLouisRams,2y1eha,The_Wayward,1 point,Fri Mar 6 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"No wasted movements   That is a pretty accurate statement.  The games of his I watched, it didn't seem like he used a bunch of flashy moves, but he made getting separation look easy.    In my opinion, I think the Rams should either go with Cooper, whom I see as the safest 1st round WR choice or go for the hail mary by trading back into the 1st or early 2nd and get DGB."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,dlnvf6,3,Fri Mar 6 01:03:53 2015 UTC,"Truthfully? No, I don't think we need one. I see this as a year for Quick to fully break out (needs to stay healthy) and for the emergence of Stedman. Bailey is a workout machine and is constantly working on his footwork. I'd love to see him crack the lineup. I absolutely don't want to see us blow our 1st on one. I don't see anyway around going OL with the 10 even if we trade back.  I posted a ""mock offseason"" yesterday grabbing DGB in the second as more of a luxury/value pick. The only reason I did it was because I knew I could likely get Grayson and some extra picks out of our 3rd rounder. I doubt that is as simple as the draft software made it in the actual draft. That draft was also put together on the ability to go get Hudson in FA and retain Barksdale. More than likely we won't do at least one of those things, which makes Center a very pressing need in the first three rounds. Needing a center out of the draft would pretty much eliminate any reasoning to go after a WR in my mind.   TL;DR: You are right that our biggest needs are OL and QB. The ability to take a WR highish in the draft relies entirely on how we approach FA."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,czah7,3,Thu Mar 5 17:49:27 2015 UTC,I just don't think any OL or non Winson/Mariota QB is worth taking at 10 this year. Last year it would have been a different story with the number of amazing OL prospects. This is a pretty weak draft for our positions of need.
StLouisRams,2y1eha,bozo7337,2,Thu Mar 5 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"I think Scherff is definitely worth the 10. We'd play him at guard instead, but he has the ability to rotate out to RT if injury strikes. He's a lot like Zack Martin, and his athleticism would allow him to pull on the interior real well. If he's not there, I'd like us to drop back and pick up a Collins/Clemmings/Humphries and some picks to play with."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:59:14 2015 UTC,Then trade down and pick up extra picks
StLouisRams,2y1eha,daedalus000,3,Thu Mar 5 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"If it's not cooper or white, i think we should focus on other areas.  But they are literally 2nd and 3rd best player in the whole draft.  So if they fall to us it's a no brainer.  Quick, Baily, Austin, Britt is a decent core...but there is no true #1 there."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,dlnvf6,2,Fri Mar 6 03:34:35 2015 UTC,Not wanting to add Cooper or White is foolish. The only people we should take over them are Winston or Mariota.

I'd rather stack ourselves with OL and cross our fingers for a healthy Bradford and Quick.  Yes, I realize it's just asking for them to be injured again, but it's what I'd rather us do.  In addition to that, Britt, Tavon, Cook, Stedman can hold their own."
StLouisRams,2y1eha,mcthsn,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly what I was thinking.  Quick and Britt on the outside with Tavon and Stedman on the inside is fine.  Not the best, but good enough if our line can hold up"

At that point we will have Britt, Quick, Tavon and Bailey as a decent group.  We draft Cooper and one of those guys is basically on the outs.  Without Britt it makes a little more sense.  But I think we have much bigger needs than WR"
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,g00dj0b,15,Fri Mar 6 18:02:08 2015 UTC,"Our cap situation is pretty bad. We have $7 mil in cap room after cutting Langford, and that move saved us $6 mil. Even if we cut Wells like everyone wants us to do we have $10 mil in cap room. Cutting Jake Long would get us to about $18 mil in cap room. Then if we re-sign Britt and Barksdale like people seem to want, there would be what $12 mil left? That is not much room to get good free agents and make a big splash."
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,m_fromm,8,Fri Mar 6 18:52:18 2015 UTC,Free agency hasn't even started yet. What exactly do you want them to do? Are you mad we missed out on trading for Matt Cassel or LeSean McCoy and his bloated contract?
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,Ihateunerds,-8,Fri Mar 6 19:56:41 2015 UTC,At a very minimum they should have already cut Jake Long.
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,To3z,10,Fri Mar 6 20:14:04 2015 UTC,Fish already said that he wouldn't mind using Long as a guard or even possibly center so they're probably still trying to negotiate a new contract. If not then they will cut him before the 10th.
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,ITameFatGirls,4,Fri Mar 6 20:37:49 2015 UTC,"Just to piggyback off this they have until the 14th (4 million dollar roster bonus after this date) to cut him, if not he's staying one more year."
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,bozo7337,12,Fri Mar 6 20:43:26 2015 UTC,"I don't see any Titans free agents worth signing, so we'll probably stand pat."

StLouisRams,2y5o3i,Maverick814,2,Fri Mar 6 19:56:47 2015 UTC,They still got time to do something.
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,ITameFatGirls,2,Fri Mar 6 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"We don't have the money for anything blockbuster. I think at minimum we need to sign a starting caliber OL in the offseason and then roleplayers, and address QB, WR, OLB, etc in the draft."
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,The_Wayward,2,Fri Mar 6 19:44:18 2015 UTC,"We can't afford or need a McCoy, can't afford Marshall, a lot of minor moves going down in between, there's not much we can do right now.  Plenty of teams are in the same boat as us in cap space, all of them doing what we are doing, cut cap casualties, wait for FA to start, let the market settle."
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,mcthsn,4,Fri Mar 6 19:12:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed here. The big news has been these blockbuster trades where someone takes on a fat contract, or old stud vets being released. The only thing I think we've goofed on is not re-signing Barksdale before FA opens. The same could go for Britt but to a much lesser extent. We'll see some more cuts soon. I'll be physically sick if we keep Scott Wells on the roster this season."
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"Dude, when was the last time the Rams made any sort of 'splash' during Free Agency?"
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,Ezmoneh,1 point,Sun Mar 8 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"You're right, but considering our record over the last decade maybe they should break from tradition?   Then again I don't see any one free agent who is going to make a huge difference.  And I'm not sure how attractive a small-market, non-playoff team with no clear starting QB is.  Unfortunately we're one of those teams that has to outbid for free agents so we're better off going after a few mid-level guys than trying too woo any of the top name guys."
StLouisRams,2y5o3i,Ezmoneh,0,Mon Mar 9 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"I find it more encouraging really, if you take away Bradford's injury as well as a couple on defense this was a playoff team last year and a legit contender for the NFC title.  They know they have about 95% of the right pieces already in place to win, just need to adjust coaching staff, which has already happened, and work to keep healthy.  Frankly, with a little luck we won't need a momentous offseason to have a special regular season."

StLouisRams,2y1853,DeniseDeNephew,4,Fri Mar 6 04:15:59 2015 UTC,Shaun Hill is a good backup and we can resign him without losing the picks or players it would take to get Geno Smith.  I'd stick with him.  Neither guy is going to get you deep into the playoffs so even if Smith is an upgrade (and I'm not convinced he is) the team should use the picks and/or cash to upgrade at some other position than backup QB.  An upgrade elsewhere could make a bigger impact on the team's success.  But you make a good point about the Tavon/Stedman/Geno connection -- that adds some intrigue to the idea.
StLouisRams,2y1853,Ihateunerds,4,Thu Mar 5 16:52:51 2015 UTC,"Based on this season, yeah, he sucks. Which means we can probably get him for real cheap. But he has more upside than Hill and with the Austin/Bailey connection I don't think it's as stupid as all that. To be clear, I wouldn't give more than like a late round or conditional pick for him."
StLouisRams,2y1853,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth considering, as a backup at least.  If the Jets take Mariota then Geno should be available for dirt cheap. Reunite him with Austin and Bailey and who knows what could happen?"
StLouisRams,2y1853,ITameFatGirls,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:59:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I suppose if the price is cheap enough, why not?  What's his cap hit versus Hill's?  I agree about Geno's upside -- as much as I like Hill as a backup I don't really think he has any upside.  He's as good as he'll ever be.  You know what you're getting with him but that's all you're getting."

Lots of potential there waiting to be unleashed. Very nice, fun offseason. Good job, /u/The_Wayward."
StLouisRams,2xybwb,CyanRam,2,Thu Mar 5 15:48:27 2015 UTC,I only have one question. Why do we have so little cap room? Ughh
StLouisRams,2xybwb,New_DudeToo,2,Thu Mar 5 03:33:43 2015 UTC,"Bradford is expensive, both Chris and Jake long are too expensive and so was Laurinaitis the past few years. A lot of people are being paid like top players at their position when they aren't."
StLouisRams,2xybwb,mlasn,2,Thu Mar 5 05:01:17 2015 UTC,"Correct. I didn't bother cutting/resigning Bradford because I don't think the Rams will mess with his contract at all this season. Jake Long was an easy cut with his salary, and I actually restructured Chris to free up a little more cash for Barksdale/Hudson. Cutting Pead would give us another $1M to play with, but I kind of expect them to keep him around for ST and the like."
StLouisRams,2xybwb,mlasn,2,Thu Mar 5 15:39:00 2015 UTC,Does Chris have much more room with restructuring? I could see him being cut next year. I think he is a good player but doesn't deserve top 5 good.
StLouisRams,2xybwb,mlasn,1 point,Thu Mar 5 16:47:18 2015 UTC,"It didn't save a lot this year, but I wanted to give the team a little more play money for depth signings. I did it with the assumption that Chris would play out his contract and we would figure out what to do with him when he hits FA in 2017. I agree he is getting paid bonkers money to play LE right now, but as we saw when he was out, he is essential to how our line functions. I doubt there's any way we re-sign him for a similar contract to the one he is on in 2017. However, I think we could bring him back for $9.5M a year or so when the time comes. Either way I'd like to see him stick around."

A better example of a ploy is the raiders and chargers both sharing I'm Carson. (Who both said that they are still working in their cities to get their deals done)  His moving to Inglewood is very serious.  I would not take his actions lightly."
StLouisRams,2xx2cx,D9-EM,3,Sat Mar 7 08:19:37 2015 UTC,Oh I'm not taking any of this lightly. That is just one of many possibilities and I'm not entirely sold on any of them.   I wouldn't discount the Carson proposal ether. Here's Chargers Special Councilman Mark Fabiani on the teams intention to move to Carson. He also touches on the Raiders and Rams situations.
StLouisRams,2xx2cx,FaulktheBlueRedbird,3,Sat Mar 7 13:55:50 2015 UTC,"That is just awesome to read.  There are no hard numbers or stats to back it up, but it stands to support the idea that, yes, putting together a capable team DOES draw more ticket sales."
StLouisRams,2xx2cx,ImTheBestMayne,3,Thu Mar 5 00:21:51 2015 UTC,This makes me happy.
StLouisRams,2xx2cx,D9-EM,3,Wed Mar 4 18:44:14 2015 UTC,"This is really nice to hear, shows that we actually do support the team. I think everyone is really excited about turning this scary situation into an opportunity to build an awesome stadium development."
StLouisRams,2xx2cx,yeepperg,2,Wed Mar 4 19:11:23 2015 UTC,Yeah people unfairly call us a fairweather fan base. 15-65 will effect ANY teams attendance. Even Cleveland. Our attendance has improved every year since 2010 despite not having a winning season and this is just more proof that the NFL belongs in St. Louis.

StLouisRams,2xx2cx,tf2hipster,4,Wed Mar 4 17:26:12 2015 UTC,"It's not just an obvious conflict of interests, but it's also incredibly ridiculous.  Due to the layout of LA, someone intending to ""send a plane"" into the proposed Inglewood Stadium from LAX would have to do a long loop around the airport to get there after taking off... whereas the AEG stadium is just a simple right turn & 5 minute flight... plus bonus of getting the Staples center."
StLouisRams,2xx2cx,D9-EM,-1,Thu Mar 5 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"I heard talks about this earlier.  It sounds like the bigger concern with it being so close to LAX is not a terror threat or anything like that, but the noise from air traffic could be a factor.  I think the new stadium would be 2.5 miles from a busy airport.  That could mean a lot of low flying planes buzzing around."
StLouisRams,2xx2cx,eight26,3,Wed Mar 4 18:18:07 2015 UTC,"Tough to say. The Hollywood park horse track was there for years without issue, but maybe an NFL stadium is a different story."
StLouisRams,2xx2cx,D9-EM,3,Wed Mar 4 22:44:44 2015 UTC,"It's weather dependent.  It's take-offs that are noisy, and most of those happen to the west, over the water."

StLouisRams,2xx2cx,Musingmike,2,Wed Mar 4 17:58:08 2015 UTC,Planes routinely fly near dozens of office buildings near LAX.  There is no safety issue.
StLouisRams,2xx2cx,D9-EM,-3,Wed Mar 4 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"Well having 80,000 people in the same place in the flight path of a runway is different.

StLouisRams,2xx2cx,eight26,3,Wed Mar 4 23:42:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'll divert air traffic during games.  The new San Jose Earthquakes (MLS) stadium is literally right across the street from San Jose International Airport, not 2.5 miles away.  It only holds 18,000 but that's more than enough to be a ""terror threat"".   Besides, nobody is taking this report seriously because it's just fear-mongering.   It's only gotten traction on the Post-Dispatch Rams Talk forum in the week or so since the article came out.  Until today I didn't see anything about it on Reddit, either here or on /r/NFL.    About the Earthquakes' stadium (which is now complete):   The bond-funded complex would be near the Quakes’ practice field and their planned $60 million stadium located across the street from Mineta San Jose International Airport."
StLouisRams,2xx2cx,D9-EM,1 point,Thu Mar 5 01:51:42 2015 UTC,Air traffic will not be diverted just because of a football game. Runway selection is dependent on the wind. Don't listen to people spreading nonsense because you just come off as stupid as well. No offense.  Source: I used to be a military air traffic controller so I know a bit about air traffic control and the FAA.

StLouisRams,2xx2cx,yeepperg,0,Wed Mar 4 23:46:19 2015 UTC,LAX and the other area airports already have a program to fly out over the ocean and inbound flights come in over the ocean to avoid problems with existing sports venues. It's been stated that any NFL stadiums will use this too. Flight path isn't an issue.

Some of there analytics greater than others but all in all I think it's pretty fair.  I'd say Quinn is elite though, Alec average, McLeod poor, and Robinson below average.  Everything else I don't mind."
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,ITameFatGirls,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:27:25 2015 UTC,Yeah Quinn definitely deserves the baby blue
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,Young_guy_with_Tumor,6,Fri Mar 6 08:00:09 2015 UTC,"Right off the bat, Quinn is elite and Robinson is better then poor. I also think Sims could qualify for average. It's really not far off."
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,D9-EM,2,Wed Mar 4 20:33:55 2015 UTC,It's because of those BS penalties.

StLouisRams,2xxpfa,richhomieram,3,Thu Mar 5 04:28:58 2015 UTC,"Great play, but unfortunately that doesn't prove he's good in coverage.  I wish I still had my PFF subscription, but if you look at their advanced stats on OLBs you will find that Ogletree is one of the worst in missed tackles, catches allowed, and yards after catch."
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,jbrooks772,3,Thu Mar 5 11:31:30 2015 UTC,That's an absolute joke.
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,New_DudeToo,2,Wed Mar 4 21:20:43 2015 UTC,It's not too far off. Look at our record
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,shefwed82,-2,Wed Mar 4 22:55:06 2015 UTC,"The team went 6-10. That speaks a lot to the level of talent on the team. edit: A few bounces differently and this team easily could have been 4-12 or 3-13. Let's not get too high on that 6-10.  And yes, the QB situation was terrible. But still, this just isn't a great team."
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,Sonofsnow,8,Wed Mar 4 19:55:12 2015 UTC,A few bounces differently and we could have easily been 9-7.
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,shefwed82,-2,Wed Mar 4 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point. We could have beaten the Cowboys and the Chargers and that gets us to 8-8. I don't know the game that gets us to 9-7.  I do know that we easily could have lost to Tampa Bay except for a fluke ending, easily could have lost to Seattle except for a couple of ridiculously good special teams plays, and easily could have lost to San Francisco save for that dumbass fumble by Kapernick.  My point being, this isn't a terrible team. But a team that could have easily finished between 3-13 and 8-8 is an average team, ESPECIALLY when the QB that we have is entirely unknown."
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,axle69,3,Wed Mar 4 20:28:09 2015 UTC,Eagles game gets us 9-7 had Pettis not dropped those balls.
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,shefwed82,6,Wed Mar 4 22:47:57 2015 UTC,6-10 With Davis and Hill is actually decent. With a average QB Like Bradford they would have won 10 or 11 games.
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,kahyote484,-6,Wed Mar 4 20:00:42 2015 UTC,"No. Absolutely not.  In Payton Manning's career up to 2011 when this article was done, he was worth about 4 wins a season. Bradford wouldn't give quite that much.  http://archive.advancedfootballanalytics.com/2011/09/how-many-wins-is-manning-really-worth.html"
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,shefwed82,7,Wed Mar 4 20:10:16 2015 UTC,How would you explain the year before the Colts got Luck?
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,shefwed82,7,Wed Mar 4 20:17:04 2015 UTC,You think Sam throws the 3 pic sixes that ended games for us? You think he can't keep the lead in the other three games where we blew huge leads? Of those 6 games I think 4 go our way. All I am saying. The offense is completely dependent on the QB and we won 6 with slubs.
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,shefwed82,-6,Wed Mar 4 20:18:22 2015 UTC,I have no reason based on Bradford's performance to think he would have done much better. But I keep forgetting that this sub thinks that is Joe Montana.
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,DiscoJer,4,Wed Mar 4 20:21:48 2015 UTC,No he is exactly average. When he has played he has been right around the Dalton line. Which would have been a great upgrade of Hill and Davis. Just by saying he isn't terrible doesn't mean I am saying is the greatest bro.
StLouisRams,2xxpfa,True-Tiger,-2,Wed Mar 4 21:52:51 2015 UTC,"Right, he is average. Which is exactly what the website in question graded him as. So how exactly are their ratings low?"

StLouisRams,2xu6jf,sgabriele,17,Tue Mar 3 22:23:24 2015 UTC,"Does anybody have any suggestions for improving the megathread?  I will keep the updated article list going in the main post, but I will soon begin to truncate it so that it's not a massive list of articles that you have to scroll past - only the most recent ones so you can efficiently stay up-to-date without all the clutter.  My only two disagreements with posts in this thread here are   1) I believe things are in fact simpler this way without gazillions of LA/stadium posts on the front page every day.  We actually talk about football now!  2) I insist that before the megathread, pretty much every thread about stadium or LA stuff DID in fact devolve into hostile fighting.  I really hated that and I thought most of you did, too.  The bickering was nonstop.  I think it's better now, and even the megathread itself seems to contain more mature discussion rather than bitter disagreements and attacks.  I really do believe it's a necessary evil, and I think our sub has improved a lot since its implementation.  But I am all ears for doing things a better way if people have ideas!  I really want everyone to be happy with how things are moderated around here - it's just hard getting an actual consensus.  If the majority of you actually want to go back to a more laissez-faire style of submitting, then I can and will support that even though I disagree with it."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bnsaluki,19,Wed Mar 4 00:18:54 2015 UTC,Is it possible to create a new megathread every week or two? That thread has become very cluttered and it is hard to find the new posts.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,daedalus000,10,Wed Mar 4 00:57:38 2015 UTC,"This is the best idea. The weakness of a long-term pinned megathread is that reddit threads don't work well in that format; a fresh megathread, with highlights of previous information in the post, would allow the discussion to begin anew with fresh information while containing as much reference material as needed to bring new participants up to speed."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,The_Wayward,6,Wed Mar 4 01:45:35 2015 UTC,Good thought - that was another idea I've considered.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:09:36 2015 UTC,I think this is the best course of action. The sub has been better off since the addition of the megathread. We can copy the articles that are linked in the post itself so we keep those for the repost. Same info in the text and a fresh batch of comments so things don't disappear.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,daedalus000,9,Wed Mar 4 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"This subreddit is much better since you created the megathread. Your feelings about the state of the subreddit before its creation are spot on, it's definitely necessary."

StLouisRams,2xu6jf,Kaos047,8,Wed Mar 4 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with /u/bwc_28, this sub had devolved tremendously prior to the megathread and I was at the point of not bothering to check it anymore.  While the megathread may have issues I unfortunately think the community has displayed an inability to have civil threads in its absence."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,Tre2,4,Wed Mar 4 01:49:23 2015 UTC,Have to echo what bwc_28 said. The sub is 100 times better having it all contained in one thread.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,DabDastic,2,Wed Mar 4 02:41:18 2015 UTC,We could set up a filter like on some of the news subreddits. Then you could have stadium related posts toggled on or off based on your preferences.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,daedalus000,3,Wed Mar 4 03:56:12 2015 UTC,"The only thing I could possibly suggest is to allow major news on the situation, it's on posts. I feel there is not enough discussion on the news when it gets buried in the mega thread"
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,DabDastic,3,Wed Mar 4 01:03:38 2015 UTC,Like only allowing actual news updates while still suppressing the opinion pieces?  I'd be open to that.

StLouisRams,2xu6jf,D9-EM,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:13:28 2015 UTC,"I actually kind of like that idea.  I'll plan to let these ideas gestate together (yours, the one about having a new megathread weekly, and possibly any others) and we'll have something better for y'all soon."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,tylerseher,11,Wed Mar 4 01:17:38 2015 UTC,It beats the hell out of what was happening before it was created. The mess in that thread was all over this sub. It's a necessary evil until this thing is over.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,12,Tue Mar 3 23:59:14 2015 UTC,"Truth. It's way too cramped.   As news come in about either stadium just make a regular post. It shouldn't have to devolve into an argument. I don't want the rams to leave, but obviously I'd like to hear news about it.   Comments about how the rams will soon be on LA and shit can be stopped though. Being douchy to everyone doesn't add to the discussion. There is an LArams sub that people can go circle jerk to if they want,"
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bozo7337,8,Tue Mar 3 22:40:57 2015 UTC,we should be able to talk about the St. Louis Rams without caring if LA fans get mad.   And all Rams fans should feel welcome to talk about the team without being singled out and attacked. Unfortunately threads like this prove that's impossible and create the necessity for a megathread. The constant attacks are better kept in one thread as opposed to throughout the entire subreddit.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,0,Wed Mar 4 00:02:12 2015 UTC,Who is attacking anyone? I'm just explaining that St. Louis Rams fans should be able to talk about their team in their sub.

StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,10,Wed Mar 4 01:14:48 2015 UTC,Comments like this are exactly why we need the megathread.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,gizzomizzo,3,Wed Mar 4 03:25:42 2015 UTC,And if St Louis people start running their mouths LA people will return the favor. This kind of childish attitude is the center of the problem. I don't live in LA. I don't live in St Louis. I don't give a rats ass about either one of your cities. Get over yourself.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bozo7337,-14,Wed Mar 4 02:14:30 2015 UTC,St. Louis fans are allowed to run their mouths because it is our team. It is the St. Louis Rams not the LA Rams our the wherever the hell you're from Rams.

StLouisRams,2xu6jf,tylerseher,4,Wed Mar 4 14:49:05 2015 UTC,Must be a new development. It used to be (just a few weeks ago) that any user who said they weren't from St Louis was downvoted to oblivion.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"I think that's a lil bit of recency bias, because in the years that I've been on here, the only time I've seen non-St. Louis people get downvoted was after this whole move to LA thing kicked up."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,D9-EM,12,Wed Mar 4 23:20:09 2015 UTC,It's not just people in St Louis' team. I've been a Rams fan for 35 years. I was never in LA but I've been a Rams fan for that long. Get over yourself it's not your team its our team.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,3,Wed Mar 4 02:26:09 2015 UTC,"/u/tylerseher said   There is an LArams sub that people can go circle jerk to if they want,   Forcing non-St Louis based fans out of this subreddit seems to be a constant attitude, even toward fans not trolling or being dicks. Your jab at LA fans being upset is also something that was unnecessary. There has been just as much attacking and anger from St Louis based fans toward non-St Louis based fans. I use that term instead of ""LA based fans"" because fans who aren't even in LA (like myself) are attacked constantly and brigaded. Which is exactly why the megathread was created."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,Kaos047,4,Wed Mar 4 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"First off I'm from Des Moines so it's whatevs for me. I said the circle jerk comments can be made in the other sub.

Is that the type of attacks you're talking about? Okay, please continue..."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bozo7337,-1,Wed Mar 4 00:27:11 2015 UTC,"Are you the guy who constantly lied about what I said and couldn't comprehend the most basic explanation? Then yep, I did call you a 10 year old troll with no reading comprehension, because that's what you were acting like. I tried having a civil conversation with you, but people tend to get upset when you lie about what they said and twist their words in every post."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,2,Wed Mar 4 00:32:29 2015 UTC,I just want to point out its pretty much you and eight26 that are in most of the fights and arguing between STL fans. You have managed to piss off several people in this Sub. Maybe you should take another look at your posts and not get in constant pissing matches with everyone.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,D9-EM,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:46:36 2015 UTC,"90% of the time I'm just calling people out when they bash non St Louis fans. I really don't care if I piss off people that are being dicks. I've never trolled, and I've always given the Rams 100% support. I get pissed when people say they're going to abandon the team. I do tend to lash out at those ""fans"", but I hardly care if those are the types of people who don't like me."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,2,Wed Mar 4 02:51:02 2015 UTC,"OK let me rephrase that then. You are part of the problem of this sub being so fucking terrible when it comes to the stadium discussion. Stop being a dick. No one likes dicks. People tell you to leave for the LA sub reddit because you are a dick, not because you are an LA fan."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,D9-EM,2,Wed Mar 4 03:14:21 2015 UTC,He's far from the only one being a dick to people. There are lots of idiots going around spouting garbage about fans in St Louis own the Rams and anybody else can leave or go fuck themselves or move to a different sub. It's just garbage just like what /u/bwc_28 posted right under this comment. Idiocy like that just fuels arguments.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,2,Wed Mar 4 04:30:39 2015 UTC,"Right. Ignore that I was saying over a year ago that we should just be talking about the Rams and there's no reason we can't all get along. I've only become a ""dick"" because other users have become so combative. Ignore that my posts are just in response to users shoving anyone living outside of St Louis out of this sub (not me, other users). If me calling out that crap is part of the problem I'm ok with it.  Edit: case in point, this is exactly what I'm talking about."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,D9-EM,0,Wed Mar 4 03:22:55 2015 UTC,go reread the conversation. If you think I lied then you misunderstood me.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bozo7337,2,Wed Mar 4 00:37:33 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you should re-read it, you lied about what I said numerous times. And not only about what I said, but what you said as well."

StLouisRams,2xu6jf,D9-EM,5,Wed Mar 4 00:50:30 2015 UTC,"Okay brother... there was no lie. I admittedly misunderstood you when you said LA/Socal fans instead of LA Rams fans. however, my point applies to both. You have an opinion and I have another. That's not a lie. The insults were though. Have a good evening."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,SoulardSTL,6,Wed Mar 4 01:02:24 2015 UTC,The problem is people really don't want to discuss the stadium issue. Or rather there are too many who don't want an honest debate about it. They'd rather insult somebody for having a different view than them. I could go in and post something in support of it and I'll get four or five angry responses with no facts and 10 down votes. Or about St Louis it'll get the same thing.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:47:31 2015 UTC,"Agree that the megathread, while conceived in the best intentions, is in effect a bit chaotic.   Would it be possible to have a new /r/ for NFL stadiums? That could attract the LA constituents, as well as San Diego and Oakland. Considering all four cities are in the conversations, it would be good to get such a thread together. It should be noted that such a thread should be directed to by threads with fans from the 3 teams + the LA contingents (LA Rams, LA Raiders, LA Chargers(?)), so they can all send their devotees there instead of here."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,bwc_28,5,Tue Mar 3 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that such a thread should be directed to by threads with fans from the 3 teams + the LA contingents (LA Rams, LA Raiders, LA Chargers(?)), so they can all send their devotees there instead of here.   Why wouldn't a subreddit for NFL Stadiums also include all talk for the new stadium in St. Louis?  All of these proposed changes are saying the same two things:   Any news and/or opinions about the Rams staying in St. Louis should be allowed Any news and/or opinions about the Rams moving to LA should be removed   This sub is about the team, not the city, and any news about a possible move is news about our team even if we don't like it.  Why demand only ""good"" news?  Why censor opinions you disagree with?  We're all adults here, how about we stop pouting about what our team's owner may or may not be doing?  How about we not label anyone who wants the team to move (or doesn't really care whether they stay in StL or not) as ""trolls"" or ""douchebags"" like we're children on a playground who are incapable of a rational discussion?"

StLouisRams,2xu6jf,eight26,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:34:58 2015 UTC,"When I typed ""3 teams"", I meant the Rams, Chargers, and Raiders, to be inclusive of all their fans in LA. Or, that such a thread would be where you talk about NFL stadium plans, including in Saint Louis, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Oakland, as well as the other 28 NFL markets.  Or: You're inferring from my post that I'm wanting to exclude news, which I am neither stating nor implying.   Here's what I mean: Let's get it all on one page, so we can get all the news from all the markets, so we all can see what's going to happen in LA."
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,houseofpayne55,-1,Wed Mar 4 00:58:57 2015 UTC,I disagree. This sub is about the St. Louis Rams. So it is about St. Louis and the Rams. We should not shy away from problems facing the city as long as they are relevant to the team. The stadium discussions are definitely relevant.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,Musingmike,0,Wed Mar 4 00:38:06 2015 UTC,The point is that we should be able to talk about our team in our sub. There is no need to complicate it.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,eight26,-5,Tue Mar 3 23:28:12 2015 UTC,I don't think we are arguing the same point. What I am trying to say is that because this it's the ST LOUIS Rams sub. La fans should not be surprised if people are upset at their comments about wanting the team to leave.
StLouisRams,2xu6jf,houseofpayne55,5,Wed Mar 4 02:38:34 2015 UTC,Fans from CA have every right to get upset when just mentioning the fact they're from CA gets them shit on in a Rams sub. There is nothing inherently wrong with being a fan of the Rams outside of Missouri.

StLouisRams,2xv3w7,banngbanng,5,Wed Mar 4 02:47:49 2015 UTC,we don't have a fourth round pick. I also don't think Grayson will last that long because of the drought of quarterbacks in this draft.

I'm a Rams fan. That's it (you know, except a fan for whoever is playing the Hawks, 9ers, or Cards on any given day)."
StLouisRams,2xx7y4,SaucemanXL,1 point,Wed Mar 4 18:41:58 2015 UTC,"Here's a good example: I grew up in Pennsylvania, my father is (inexplicably) a huge Rams fan, while most of my friends were either Steelers or Eagles diehards. I grew up not knowing who to like - until I watched the Greatest Show on Turf and chose to be odd guy out and like the Rams. So I'm not a fan from birth, but I'm still an avid fan (~16 years), coming on stronger in my adult years. Now I'm married to a woman who grew up in Pittsburgh and is a huge Steelers fan, and so is the rest of her family. AFC/NFC. I root for both."

StLouisRams,2xujhl,ITameFatGirls,3,Wed Mar 4 00:35:39 2015 UTC,"Hes pretty versatile and could eaily adjust to our system. but it would be a pretty bad pick since our 2nd OLB plays around 30% of our snaps. unless we plan on cutting JL55 and moving ogletree to MLB, i dont like the Vic Beasley pick."
StLouisRams,2xujhl,bozo7337,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:37:48 2015 UTC,"Agree here.  Phenominal player, just not here."
StLouisRams,2xujhl,mlasn,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:29:55 2015 UTC,He could be worked into the system. He would probably be an upgrade over Ogletree eventually. Faster and a better pass rusher and a better run defender. Personally I'd rather take one of the CB's if they're there along with Beasley but if we could add him to this defense it would be great. Another thing with him to keep in mind is he could be worked in as Chris Longs successor in a couple years. Long is a free agent after the 2016 season. We give Beasley 2 years to acclimate to the NFL game and put on a little wait and have him on the other side of Quinn with Brockers and Donald in the middle. That's a pretty frightening front four.
StLouisRams,2xpkg6,CplPJ,8,Mon Mar 2 21:04:46 2015 UTC,10 Should have been higher and Laurinaitis' should have been lower.  Also how is McDonald's hit that ended the Tampa game not in there?!
StLouisRams,2xpkg6,Bskrilla,6,Mon Mar 2 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"Gotta say, our regime has picked up some bruisers. By my count, the hits come from:   McDonald: 2 McLeod: 1 Ogletree: 1 Laurinaitis: 1 Barron: 1 Joyner: 2 Johnson: 1 Gaines: 1   That a lot of dudes who can lay some wood. Some of those hits are nasty to watch, but it's nice to at least have a team who wants to be aggressive and fight to win."
StLouisRams,2xpkg6,sweeps28,3,Mon Mar 2 21:06:26 2015 UTC,The hit on Sanders was probably the sickest hit I've seen in awhile. McLeod timed that perfectly. And that's awesome too how Lamarcus Joyner is like 5'8 and he's still laying people out in the NFL.

StLouisRams,2xe18l,BeefyMcFlaps,15,Fri Feb 27 20:25:50 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I didn't read the whole thing. But of what I did read, he doesn't take into account drops, specifically the amount of drops this team experienced in the deep game. Gibson and Givens were both notorious for drops deep down field. It kind've became second nature to make small passes just because no one could hold onto the ball. This year was a win simply because we had way less dropped passes than last year.   Edit: it's like No one remembers, but it used to be painfully obvious that we had a good quarterback who was trying to win with a JV team to his sides. He'd make great passes just to be dropped in open field. Now that we have the team to support, I can't pass on Bradford until I see for myself that he's as bad as the analytics say."
StLouisRams,2xe18l,NewBroPewPew,6,Fri Feb 27 21:32:52 2015 UTC,I also remember some games where drop back after drop back not one WR would even come close to open. I remember a segment where they showed like 10 plays quickly in a row everyone was smothered.  Bradford has never had a WR who could even come close to a #1 WR. Remember when we got Brandon Lloyed? All the STL sports analysts were like finally some talent. BRANDON LLOYED at one point was a savior.
StLouisRams,2xe18l,BeefyMcFlaps,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:03:00 2015 UTC,Exactly. I feel like the people who TRULY watch the games every week know that Sam wasn't the reason for his poor performance.
StLouisRams,2xe18l,Graybealz,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:05:27 2015 UTC,"In the same vein, how about when Bradford would purposefully overthrowing receivers due to the lack of separation?"
StLouisRams,2xe18l,BeefyMcFlaps,2,Fri Feb 27 22:27:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think that shows more of a smart qb, not a conservative one. He would put the ball where the play could be made, but our receivers just weren't at his level.   Edit: I can't remember a play where Bradford blatently caused a turnover due to a terrible decision. It's always been due to terrible supporting cast."
StLouisRams,2xe18l,Opifex,2,Fri Feb 27 22:37:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a Bradford supporter, but I can think of a couple.  There was the batted ball against Arizona that lead to a TD in 2013, for example.  All QBs make mistakes though, so personally I don't hold it against him.  The number of good, smart throws he makes far outweigh his poor throws."
StLouisRams,2xe18l,BeefyMcFlaps,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:53:29 2015 UTC,Is it his mistake that a DL batted his pass?
StLouisRams,2xe18l,Opifex,2,Fri Feb 27 22:56:13 2015 UTC,"You could make the argument that he shouldn't have made the pass, but that is neither here or there.  I still want Bradford under center in 2015."
StLouisRams,2xe18l,bozo7337,1 point,Fri Feb 27 22:59:16 2015 UTC,All four of his ints in 2013 were batted balls at the line of scrimmage or tipped by the recievers.
StLouisRams,2xe18l,Opifex,1 point,Sun Mar 1 17:44:28 2015 UTC,That's true.  Nothing he can do about a muffed catch.  There were some discussions on here regarding whether or not the batted passes were Bradford's fault or the Line (the answer is probably both).
StLouisRams,2xe18l,llandar,-1,Sun Mar 1 18:39:04 2015 UTC,Really not sure what drops have to do with yards BEFORE the catch. Maybe read the article.
StLouisRams,2xe18l,BeefyMcFlaps,1 point,Sat Feb 28 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"So let's say you are a quarterback, and you have tried to push the ball down field with a few deep passes, but all of them have come up empty. When you throw small dink passes to the flat or over the top, you know your receivers (would have been Amendola, Cook, SJax, Stacy - Your ""better"" receivers) catch the ball at a better rate. Would you rather continue to push down field, with history repeating itself time and time again, or take the safe route and hope the YAC gets us to a first down?  That's how it relates. Don't be a dick on the sub, man. We already have enough problems with the stadium dilemma.   Edit: Unless I'm unaware of YBC taking attempted passes into consideration as well."
StLouisRams,2xe18l,llandar,1 point,Sat Feb 28 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not being a dick. You said SPECIFICALLY that you didn't read the article. So read it. Here:   Its very hard to have a terribly low average of YBC on the season. Primarily because the players who are not throwing down field much are typically backup QBs or young, inexperienced QBs. The coach creates a very safe gameplan for them, which involves a lot of short drops and passes close to (or behind) the line of scrimmage. To illustrate how rare it is: since 2010, only 7 times did a quarterback pass for less than 3.0 yards before catch on the season (with a minimum of 250 attempts).   Sam Bradford was the only quarterback to have two such seasons (2013 and 2010). That’s correct. Bradford joins Jimmy Clausen (in his rookie year), Blaine Gabbert (in his rookie year), Christian Ponder (in his second year) and perennial backups Chad Henne (in 2013) and Shaun Hill (in 2010) as the only quarterbacks to throw for FEWER than 3.0 yds BEFORE catch over an entire season (min 250 att) since 2010. But Bradford did it twice, something no other QB did.  The only QB to have two seasons with a YBC below 3. I get it, he didn't have great receivers. He's not the only QB in that situation though and he performed worse than his own backups.   He's a bust. He might be super talented but it never translated to the NFL and he breaks in half at the slightest breeze. I don't get this sub's hard on for basically Tony Banks 2.0."
StLouisRams,2xe18l,BeefyMcFlaps,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:08:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I said I read part of it. I read that. Still doesn't take into account how bad our team was early in his career. I'm not giving up on him and neither should you.
StLouisRams,2xe18l,llandar,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:03:26 2015 UTC,You keep arranging those deck chairs then.
StLouisRams,2xe18l,llandar,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:47:59 2015 UTC,That totally makes sense that as soon as he was out they became NFL worthy! You must be a scientist.
StLouisRams,2xe18l,shefwed82,3,Sat Feb 28 22:24:06 2015 UTC,What do the analytics say about the FAs that could potentially take his place?
StLouisRams,2xe18l,cshay33,3,Sun Mar 1 19:48:57 2015 UTC,"These comments. I swear, Bradford might be the athlete who has done the least in his career to get the most ridiculous, over the top love from a group of people. I just don't get this sub's infatuation with him.  I know it is a different sport, but this town shits all over Matt Holiday for having the gall to have made a lot of money. At least he has produced. Sam hasn't done a damn thing and has made a boatload of money at it."
StLouisRams,2xe18l,bozo7337,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:08:52 2015 UTC,"It is certainly fair to point out that Sam's shaky stats are in part mitigated by the poor team's he's been on. But yeah, I don't understand how this sub excuses them entirely as if he's still a first or second-year player."
StLouisRams,2xe18l,ITameFatGirls,5,Mon Mar 2 17:30:33 2015 UTC,Maybe Bradford didn't throw the ball deep because his best deep ball receiver was a 'never healthy' Danario Alexander.. There is a reason Danny Amendola looked so good in a Rams uniform.
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,surferkwc,21,Fri Feb 27 00:46:18 2015 UTC,COME HOME.
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,xKeyNin,15,Fri Feb 27 00:55:34 2015 UTC,"I know everyone keeps saying ""Bring him home!"", but honestly, I don't see room for him here this year.  I would love to see him go to an AFC contender (Colts?) and finally get a chance to go far in the playoffs.  I definitely want to see him sign a one day contract with the Rams one day, but not this year.  EDIT:  SJax just posted this blog post..  The biggest takeaway is this:   Make no mistake: I can still punish a defense. I still have a warrior's heart. There are 1,000-yard seasons left in these legs. I know what I am still capable of, and I have every intention of proving it."
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,mrcx8d,5,Fri Feb 27 02:33:15 2015 UTC,I'd love to see him come home and play those hard downs that neither Tre or Benny could get. They won't use poor Zac Stacy with thoses like they should so lets bring sj39 home
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,CarbonxGuitar,2,Fri Feb 27 02:29:28 2015 UTC,"I remember him on the bench for 3rd and shorts, especially along the goal line."
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,wohldmad,2,Fri Feb 27 15:10:51 2015 UTC,Poor guy never got a chance. He's a great athlete but was having a sophomore season.
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,CarbonxGuitar,11,Fri Feb 27 16:12:03 2015 UTC,SJ39 COME HOME! HYPE!!!!
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,SalukiDawgMaroon,5,Fri Feb 27 01:56:50 2015 UTC,I said this in another thread.   Trade Zach Stacy for like a 4-5th rounder. He's just going to be riding the bench all season.   Sign SJax to a two year deal. Use him as the thumper and occasion goal line back. Just watch him turn it on late in the season and if we make the playoffs he'll be a beast.
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,Bond_007x,3,Fri Feb 27 02:22:38 2015 UTC,What's wrong with riding the bench? Every team has backup players that ride the bench all season.
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,estryshak,2,Fri Feb 27 02:34:06 2015 UTC,"A team may still be willing to take a chance on Stacy at this point, and the difference between him and SJax probably isn't much"
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,JiveTurkey92,3,Fri Feb 27 05:04:56 2015 UTC,"I would love Sjax to come back and finish his career with us, hopefully with a few playoff runs in there :)"
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,ITameFatGirls,5,Fri Feb 27 04:59:58 2015 UTC,"He'll sign a one day contract with us one year, but not this one.  He still has something, very little, left in the tank, but we are set at HB."
StLouisRams,2xaq9o,Bskrilla,2,Fri Feb 27 02:07:00 2015 UTC,BRING HIM HOME!!
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,mrcx8d,12,Thu Feb 26 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"I won't forget his game week nine of the 2013 season. Six tackles, four tackles for loss, two sacks.   Good luck, Kendall."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,Vanscoten,2,Thu Feb 26 21:37:57 2015 UTC,"Also the hit against Josh McCown last year.  Sick hit, bullshit roughing the passer."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,QUINNtessentialTruth,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:26:07 2015 UTC,I believe that was Brockers.
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,Chillinthamost,9,Mon Mar 2 20:03:58 2015 UTC,He was actually a pretty good player. We probably could have snatched a late round pick for him or something
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,diesel321,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:15:01 2015 UTC,Which might mean were looking at signing someone? Not sure if that's how it typically goes
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,estryshak,2,Thu Feb 26 22:29:52 2015 UTC,"Likely cut him as a courtesy.  By releasing him instead of making a trade, Langford is free to sign a new contract with a team of his choosing."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,servvits_ban_boner,7,Fri Feb 27 04:11:08 2015 UTC,"@KendallLangford: Thanks for the well wishes and a huge thank you to the @STLouisRams for the opportunity to play for such a great Organization! #ramsnation   Hate to see good players go, but I think everyone saw this coming. Good luck to the guy and I hope he has a great career."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,CallOnTyrone,13,Thu Feb 26 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"Langford is a good player, so it's sad to see him go.  That being said he will get more playing time on another team and that's pretty expensive for a depth DT.  Good luck to him wherever he lands!"
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,Opifex,7,Thu Feb 26 21:17:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, solid run stuffing DT, but Brockers and Donald are both as good or better. I'm all for Hayes getting more playing time at DT as well."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,frankoftank,8,Thu Feb 26 22:25:40 2015 UTC,"The door is still open for him to come back at reduced pay, but I think its likely someone gives him a look to start somewhere."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,The_Wayward,5,Thu Feb 26 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"He's got starting talent, he should go somewhere with more opportunity."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,alderaan_never4get,5,Fri Feb 27 02:22:24 2015 UTC,Man this sucks. One of the things that makes our D-Line so good isn't just our starters but the depth we have. I totally understand the move but it's always a shame to see a talented and friendly player go
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,ayanak27,5,Thu Feb 26 22:48:17 2015 UTC,"This is sad to see, I like everyone on our line. If Hayes or sims goes too I will be bummed. But 6m is a lot of money. I wish bradford could help us out too."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,3,Thu Feb 26 23:00:52 2015 UTC,"Everyone seen this coming, he was good depth, but didnt really fit the 4-3 scheme we ran. hopefully Scott Wells is next, along with pead, and Jake long and Sam Bradford take paycuts"
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,Hoj55,6,Thu Feb 26 21:10:29 2015 UTC,"Pead costs them less than 1 million against the cap.  They may cut him, but he's not exactly costing them a lot.    I also think he's an upgrade over Chase Renolds because he has more upside, some pass catching ability, and was actually playing pretty well on ST before he got hurt."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,Bskrilla,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:29:17 2015 UTC,Long needs to go. His body has broken down.
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,iamlogan,3,Fri Feb 27 17:49:17 2015 UTC,I hope he does well wherever he goes. And I hope the Rams use that money on a useful FA.
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,LLv2,2,Thu Feb 26 21:22:48 2015 UTC,I guess Aaron Donald proved himself.
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,ITameFatGirls,11,Thu Feb 26 23:09:10 2015 UTC,Understatement of the year.
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,LLv2,1 point,Fri Feb 27 01:55:02 2015 UTC,"Came down to $$$$, plus they play different techniques."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,sjphilsphan,2,Fri Feb 27 02:12:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, Kendall Langford is a good run stopping DT who doesn't pass rush much.  Aaron Donald is a wrecking ball."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,bwc_28,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:43:01 2015 UTC,He never hit so hard in love
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,ITameFatGirls,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:56:50 2015 UTC,Paving the way to draft Danny Shelton!
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,bwc_28,3,Thu Feb 26 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"That'd be hilarious, Quinn - Donald - Shelton - Long, with Brockers - Westbrook - Hayes in rotation :))))))"
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:10:41 2015 UTC,"I'd almost feel bad for opposing QBs, almost."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,MathBeaudet,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:14:50 2015 UTC,"I don't get this. We don't really have use for him to justify his cost, but he's a talented player who would be an upgrade as a starter for a lot of teams. Was there really no one willing to give us anything in a trade for him?"
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,ITameFatGirls,3,Fri Feb 27 02:02:55 2015 UTC,"Remember that by trading him, other teams would have to take his $6 million dollar salary.  That's kind of a tall order for a DT approaching 30."
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,DiscoJer,1 point,Fri Feb 27 02:18:27 2015 UTC,Also other teams know that they will release him. Why send pick when you can wait and pick him up on the market. And there's also a lot of other good DTs in FA
StLouisRams,2x9wq0,ITameFatGirls,1 point,Fri Feb 27 11:59:00 2015 UTC,"This was expected and fairly obvious, cap cut, too much money for rotational DT.  He'll get picked up somewhere, when he was good he was good, about 10 games a year, the other 6 you'd think the guy wasn't playing, inconsistent but good player.  Best of Luck :)  Jake Long, you are next."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,Ethanhekker,12,Fri Feb 27 04:49:01 2015 UTC,"Assuming all things equal and we're not trading picks:   Winston Mariota Scherff Cooper White   In that order. Cooper and White are interchangeable in my mind, but I'd take the polished prospect since we have the high upside, jump ball guys in Britt (assuming we re-sign him) and Quick."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,CplPJ,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:30:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with this order.  If one of the two top QBs falls to us I think we have to take them.  If not, go OL.  If no highly rated OL available, then look at the WRs."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,Opifex,5,Fri Feb 27 18:49:08 2015 UTC,"For me I want to build our O-line the same way Dallas did with two first round picks. I don't really know much about O-lineman but Scherff, Peat, and Collins all seem highly rated.  I watched some film of TJ Clemmings and he just looks like a bully. Run blocks pretty hard and gets to the second level well from what I saw. The Rams have a tendency to select from the same school so maybe Donald goes #13 and Clemmings goes #10? Or the Rams could trade down?  If I have to select out of this group - I want Scherff. But things change between now and the draft so just give me the best O-lineman on draft day."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,cariboustew28,1 point,Fri Feb 27 06:20:47 2015 UTC,"Yea I love me some TJ.  I understand why people may be skeptical, but he just started playing OT the past TWO FREAKING YEARS, switched over from defense.  It's absolutely amazing how good he looks playing only two years.  This guy has no ceiling."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,ITameFatGirls,4,Fri Feb 27 19:01:10 2015 UTC,"My order of preference would be Winston, Cooper, White, Mariota then Schreff."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,bozo7337,4,Fri Feb 27 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"Scherff or if Mariota dropped to us, I would say go for it."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,reversequailman,2,Fri Feb 27 06:04:34 2015 UTC,"For me, it doesn't matter who we have under center, in the backfield or out wide if we can't protect the guy who is taking the snaps. Build the O-line with the best available player. If it comes to it, use the first two picks to take care of the line, then grab positiional depth with best available to fit our needs. That's just my two cents though."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,jxclem,2,Fri Feb 27 07:40:51 2015 UTC,"1) Winston  2) Mariota  3) White  4) Cooper  5) Scherff  I don't really understand why we would go OL in the first. We're set at LT, and G/C/RT isn't generally worth a top 10 pick. The holes in our line can be fixed in the later rounds. If any of the above 4 are on the board, we'd be stupid to take Scherff IMO."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,BrawndoTTM,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:04:05 2015 UTC,"Yea I'm with you, lot of people of Ram nation are fine with a G or RT at 10 but not me.  If we go that route Id expect a trade down which Snead has been able to do at will practically since he came to town."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,ITameFatGirls,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"In order: Scherff, Shelton, Winston, Cooper, White."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,bwc_28,1 point,Fri Feb 27 06:26:03 2015 UTC,"Let's take a QB first and foremost, and if we are able to grab Scherff or Cooper, all the better. We desperately need a QB."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,chemicalpoisons,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:48:08 2015 UTC,"I pray the Snead/Fisher brain trust doesn't draft Winston or Mariota. I know most people don't agree, but I really can't see either of those guys becoming elite NFL quarterbacks. I'd be ok with any of the top receivers in the draft, but I'm a big ""trenches first"" kinda guy. I can't claim to have any sort of discerning eye when it comes to evaluating college lineman, so give me whoever the coaches and scouts think is best and get him to work. O-lines win ballgames. No quarterback is good when he doesn't have time to throw the ball, and every NFL QB can hit an open receiver when he's got time in the pocket."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,melkipersr,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:33:23 2015 UTC,I kind of like Bryce Petty out of Baylor

StLouisRams,2xbjdg,callmeNY,2,Fri Feb 27 16:22:44 2015 UTC,No absolutely not. He should still be there in the 2nd round. Maybe the 3rd.
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,TheDuke13,2,Fri Feb 27 16:26:26 2015 UTC,He's growing on me the more I watch and see of him for sure.

StLouisRams,2xbjdg,TheDuke13,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:07:40 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, have you watched any Garret Grayson tape? I personally think he's the third best QB, but Petty looked alright also."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,banngbanng,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"Really surprised people want in on Scherff over Winston.  I want to win, NFL is a QB driven league, QB is a question mark on this team, draft the QB."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,ITameFatGirls,2,Fri Feb 27 19:03:04 2015 UTC,"Well, I see it more as whether we have faith in Bradford or not. If we do, our OL is awful. If we don't, you're right about the QB driven thing, and we need Winston."
StLouisRams,2xbjdg,ITameFatGirls,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"It's easier to build a line using second/third rounders plus FA than it is to find a franchise QB.  I like Bradford but you are only as good as your availability.  I'd rather sign Jeremy Parnell relatively cheap to play RT, grab Cam Erving late first, early second, and add competition bodies, best man wins, to fill out the LG spot.  (I'm expecting Long to get released). If Long stays I suppose for one year we can have him at the LG spot.  Robinson - ? - Erving - Saffold - Parnell  Parnell impressed me once Doug Free went down in Dallas.  Traditional swing tackle he stepped right in and performed better than Free.  Murray kept running, didn't give up one sack in all his games (7), Id like him."

Franchise QB potential >>>>>>>>>>> OL, plenty of talent through day 2 of the draft at the line, FA 10 days away.  But I really think now IF Snead/Fish go OL they will trade back down.  Robinson is our LT, I'd hate choosing a RT or OG (IMO Scherff best transition) at number 10, bad bad value traditionally.   Trading back down a couple spots you'd still have Clemmings (my #1 OT), Peat, Collins, all three Im for at the right place.  Hopefully White or Cooper fall past the 6, which one of them to fall is likely cause no way Chicago, Atlanta, Giants are taking a wideout."
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,ITameFatGirls,2,Thu Feb 26 01:26:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd love a trade down to like 12 or 13 and pick up a 4th rounder or something
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,dlnvf6,13,Thu Feb 26 02:12:16 2015 UTC,"O-line sounds good but I'm tired of mediocrity at the QB position. If he's available, I'd fully endorse taking him."

StLouisRams,2x5qyb,helpimnaked,2,Thu Feb 26 17:24:11 2015 UTC,"If our front office thinks he is a franchise QB then they should absolutely pick him. With your logic basically any team with a top pick should never pick a QB. Say what you want about early draft pick QBs that have been bad behind bad lines, e.g. David Carr, but I think they would have been bad behind any line. Good QBs always get it done despite bad circumstances."
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,ClitorisNigga,1 point,Thu Feb 26 11:09:43 2015 UTC,"No, with my logic any team with an O-Line as bad as ours should focus on that rather than a qb. When we drafted Bradford everyone thought he would be our franchise qb but since we couldn't protect him we are now in this situation. Would be a shame to waste another good qb."
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,To3z,0,Thu Feb 26 14:42:34 2015 UTC,"since we couldn't protect him      Are you implying that lack of protection lead to his 2 knee catastrophes? I don't mean that argumentatively, genuinely curious. I don't seem to recall him being particularly battered (a'la Warner/Bulger in the Martz era). (But my memory is increasingly unreliable, so there's that...)"
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,SQLDave,2,Thu Feb 26 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"Well yes, the last ACL injury could have been prevented if we had a better LT in than Jake Long.  He's not being used as a tackle dummy like Bulger, but our line isn't getting Bradford enough time for big plays to develop.  They can run block, sure, but we need a phalanx on pass plays."
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,thedude37,-3,Thu Feb 26 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"We also need a decent WR/TE to support them. I am on the Mariota train, if you ask me. But damn, it'd be nice if we got Brandon."
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,TheeVande,7,Wed Feb 25 22:27:17 2015 UTC,I'd take Devin Funchess in the 2nd. There's our WR/TE
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,MathBeaudet,3,Wed Feb 25 22:30:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree, he is exactly like Cook. Big and fast. Can't block."
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,butter_my_fingers,0,Thu Feb 26 02:12:50 2015 UTC,But does he shove his own teammates??
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,BrawndoTTM,2,Thu Feb 26 06:14:14 2015 UTC,Would be cool but I doubt he falls. Someone will reach for him in the late first.
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,banngbanng,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:31:05 2015 UTC,His 40 time really hurt his draft stock. It's hard to justify taking a WR with 4.7 speed in the first.
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,TheeVande,6,Thu Feb 26 05:17:20 2015 UTC,I accept these terms and conditions!
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,washeduplegend,3,Wed Feb 25 22:29:59 2015 UTC,I've seen both Mariota and Winston to us at 10 in mock drafts today.
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,crackalac,-2,Thu Feb 26 02:44:06 2015 UTC,I'd rather grab a guard and DGB if he drops to the 2nd.
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,Ihateunerds,16,Wed Feb 25 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"When I see comments like this get upvoted, I understand why the rest of the world doesn't think STL is a football town.   Taking a guard anywhere in the first round is retarded, much less taking one tenth overall when a potential franchise QB that we've needed for ten years now is still on the board."

StLouisRams,2x5qyb,CplPJ,1 point,Thu Feb 26 06:31:26 2015 UTC,"Why not a guard? If you can get the right one, it can help a lot. Dallas' line is monstrous, thanks to getting guys like Zack Martin and Travis Frederick in the first round."
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,Ihateunerds,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:32:04 2015 UTC,"Zack Martin is really a tackle.  Good teams do that a lot when they are so deep, draft tackles and just plug them in at guard.  The Rams however don't have Tony Romo or Dez Bryant, or even a good RT.  They don't have that luxury.  If you wanna make a case for take the best Tackle available to take over for Barksdale and move him inside or don't resign him, then that at least makes some sense.  But you don't draft ""guards"" that high.  Guards are just slower, shorter tackles.  You can fill those spots in FA or later in the draft.  But passing on Mariotta would be a mistake in my eyes."
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,CplPJ,1 point,Fri Feb 27 05:44:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, get a QB instead, or even a tackle. I'm just saying a guard isn't always a terrible idea. It's not like getting a kicker or punter in the first, where you can very easily get a UDFA of the same skill at those positions."
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,xKeyNin,8,Fri Feb 27 06:37:53 2015 UTC,I don't want DGB at all until he proves he can stay away from trouble.
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,crackalac,0,Thu Feb 26 01:39:46 2015 UTC,Weed crimes are just lol to me. So really he only has one mark on his record that I'm concerned with.

StLouisRams,2x5qyb,gabers24,-1,Thu Feb 26 06:31:13 2015 UTC,I'm sure this Mock Draft will be accurate unlike the thousands that have Mariota going in the top 5 (or sixth to Jets at the latest).
StLouisRams,2x5qyb,estryshak,8,Thu Feb 26 00:15:51 2015 UTC,"Not saying it will happen, but Manziel and Bridgewater were going top 5 this time last year...."

StLouisRams,2x5qyb,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,2,Thu Feb 26 06:28:59 2015 UTC,"Mariota is a better prospect than them though. He's bigger, faster, and has a stronger arm."

StLouisRams,2x4hsv,TyronSmith,6,Wed Feb 25 16:25:50 2015 UTC,As a non-rams fan you addressed some of our biggest needs. If the top 5 WR are off the board in the second I may have gone guard or LB depending on who's available. The whole draft needs to be taken with a grain of salt though. Vic Beasley is a good football player but no way does he go #1.
StLouisRams,2x4hsv,Areyoumyfriend,5,Wed Feb 25 16:40:28 2015 UTC,Kind of kicking myself for not grabbing Dawson or McKinney in the 2nd.
StLouisRams,2x4hsv,Areyoumyfriend,3,Wed Feb 25 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold on Dawson. He can make plays but he's slow and in the NFL speed kills. If he's matched on a quick RB or TE he'll get beat every time. Plus It's only a mock draft in  February, you did good.  Edit: Words are hard"
StLouisRams,2x4hsv,bozo7337,6,Wed Feb 25 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"No way Hundley falls to the third. Anyway, I'd rather have Grayson or even Petty."
StLouisRams,2x4hsv,bozo7337,3,Wed Feb 25 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of Coates at all, like you said his drop rate is bad and he showed bad hands at the combine to add to it. As others have said the LBs would be nice, pj Williams is an option as are more oline help. If I went WR with what was left I might go Agholor. Love the 1st and 3rd rounders though."
StLouisRams,2x4hsv,TB_Punters,3,Wed Feb 25 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"Yea, I was a bit underprepared after Green-Beckham got picked up.  Tre Jackson was actually my next choice, and I went back and forth between him and Coates."
StLouisRams,2x57w3,NewBroPewPew,2,Wed Feb 25 19:33:07 2015 UTC,"Is it because the mic is right where the handoff is taking place, or does Shaun fuckin' slam the ball in there?"

StLouisRams,2x57w3,Bskrilla,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:58:05 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly you're coached to. Easier to make the handoff if you slam it into their gut.
StLouisRams,2x5cj5,lootedcorpse,8,Wed Feb 25 20:05:59 2015 UTC,It's purely to do with injuries. And a little about his giant cap. To have so much money sunk in a player who may only play a few games a year is risk. There's no doubt of his talent though. He could be a great QB. But it's all about the risk.
StLouisRams,2x5cj5,TGMurray,12,Wed Feb 25 20:36:59 2015 UTC,He's had two straight ACL tears in the same knee. Those aren't minor injuries...
StLouisRams,2x5cj5,bwc_28,4,Wed Feb 25 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"Well from the outside he's only played 7 games in the last 32. That's an awful record, and there's no doubt in anybody's minds if he'd have played all of those games we'd have had a much better record both years.  But Fisher and Snead have been outspoken in their belief for him and that he can overcome the injuries. The choice of OC and QB coach were both impacted by what Sam had to say, so there's no doubt, at least in my mind that he's the QB of our short term future. And depending on next season I believe he can be our Franchise QB of the future"
StLouisRams,2x5cj5,TGMurray,2,Wed Feb 25 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"see? its so confusing. everyone seems to think he's a goner, but all the signs say he's there for awhile."
StLouisRams,2x5cj5,JimboLodisC,4,Wed Feb 25 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"My opinion: Part Bradford, part front office.  1st pick overall in 2010 draft. Hasn't lived up to hype, but it's not entirely on him.

The problem is the Rams haven't had a winning season in over a decade, and I don't see Sam as being the reason they break that streak. It's gonna have to be a combo of a few other things falling into place."
StLouisRams,2x5cj5,DiscoJer,4,Wed Feb 25 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"Well, besides the obvious health issues, he mostly throws short passes. Really short passes.   Which you could live with if we had better receivers. But most of our guys cannot get yardage after the catch.  Most advanced QB stats rank Bradford's performance relative to other QBs in the 20s - so a little bit wose than average. Yet he makes a staggering amount of money.  So really, he's not a bad QB, he's just not a good one and is way overpaid. And injury prone."
StLouisRams,2x5cj5,sour_deez,5,Wed Feb 25 21:42:54 2015 UTC,"Speaking about on the field stuff only I would mention his extremely low YPA over his career.  He is very quick to throw a checkdown.  He is not the type of QB that can 'throw a receiver open' but is accurate hitting a receiver that is already open.   His o-line has not been world class but he also is not the best at sensing and avoiding pressure.   His TD:INT ratio looks nice but that could be attributed to him not taking many risks.  Too cautious.  Not hard to avoid INTs with so many short passes / checkdowns.  Then there are the health issues.  Many of his shortcomings can be improved upon though, I still have some hope for him but it's fading with each season."
StLouisRams,2x5cj5,melkipersr,2,Thu Feb 26 03:18:03 2015 UTC,"His YPA has always been super low, which is troubling, but I think more of a symptom of the quality of the organization he joined (to sum in one word, abysmal).  He's never had any sort of quality in the receiving corps. Granted, it's always a little tricky to figure out if a passing game fails because of the receivers or the QB (and often it's both), but Bradford actually made most his former receivers look better than they've looked since leaving the Rams.   Take Amendola for example. He was Bradford's go-to guy. Amendola had 27 catches, 200 yards, and a lone TD this past season in 16 games. With the best quarterback of all time throwing him the ball. In an offense that spent half the season maligned by every ""expert"" for its lack of weapons. Not too impressive right? Well Wk 2 of 2012 Bradford hit Amendola 15 times for 160 yards and a touchdown against a team that made the playoffs that year, albeit that playoff team was the Redskins.  Saying his o-line has not been ""world class"" is an absurd understatement. He was sacked 70 times during his first two seasons in the NFL, which is pretty awful considering he only played 10 games his 2nd season. The o-line was in the top 10 (or bottom, depending how you wanna look at it) in QB hits allowed in 2 of his first three seasons. What happened the only year Bradford's line wasn't in that dubious company? He won OROY. The line's really starting to shape up, and if I'm Snead I'm going with the best lineman available in the 1st round if none of their top 5 targets are left. So hopefully we'll get a real chance to see Bradford play behind a professional caliber line.  There's no way around the injuries; they've been simultaneously devastating and ridiculously unfortunate. Just some real bad luck, and if you want Bradford (which personally, I do) you just have to grit your teeth and pray every time he drops back.  Long story short, if he stays healthy, he's the best option for the Rams this year. His contract is a big pill to swallow, and, as much as I love the guy, total dick move on his part not being willing to renegotiate. If he's healthy and they don't have the usual slew of backbreaking injuries, the Rams compete for the division title and probably sneak into the playoffs anyways next year. The Seahawks are gonna be down; the Niners are gone; I will never count out Bruce Arians, but let's face it Carson Palmer is even more snakebitten than Bradford. Two ACL tears both in the midst of career years, both after signing lucrative extensions with so much hope in the air? Goddamn tragic.  Also, I fully understand if this all seems ridiculously biased. I've been on board the Bradford train since the first time I saw him play at OU. That being said, I do try to look at things objectively, and I tend to have a solid eye for these things.You'll have to take my word there though"

StLouisRams,2x5cj5,kersey79,-1,Thu Feb 26 03:00:06 2015 UTC,Seriously I know it worked for Kurt Warner but guys like Tebow and Bradford are obsessed with Jesus and I honestly think they assume Jesus will help their careers through prayer and this causes them to be lazy and and less reliant on themselves...
StLouisRams,2x5cj5,kersey79,-2,Fri Feb 27 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"I'm blaming Tebow for Tebow...  I think once anyone begins to rely on Jesus or God too much, they take themselves out of the equation and believe that divine intervention or fate will make them excel at the game of football. It's an observation I think more people should make.  Scott Wells is another Jesus lover and you see how bad he sucks."
StLouisRams,2x61ts,Darams666,13,Wed Feb 25 23:03:52 2015 UTC,I don't think he would offer us much of an upgrade and we are already pretty strapped in cap room.

StLouisRams,2x61ts,bozo7337,2,Thu Feb 26 00:17:04 2015 UTC,"If there's a big market for him, I wouldn't spend too much on him but I think he can be a nice addition on 3rd down. He's a better receiver than all of our back and any QB we will have under center could use a veteran in the backfield.   Of all the FA backs available he would be the only one that would make sense."

There aren't any sure fire options, Bradford is just one of many bad options out there. He has more upside than a lot of the other choices, but the injury risk is too great to even think of paying his full freight.  I still have a hard time believing there is any team willing to pay Bradford his current contract AND give up something of value in return, but if someone is that desperate I'd be happy to oblige them.  The Rams are potentially a good enough team to make the playoffs with a decent game manager of a QB, especially with the cap space that trading Bradford would open up."

He doesn't see the field very well.... quite terrible actually, open receivers and yet he'll turn and scramble for 3 yards.  Very Manzielish pocket presence which scares the hell out of me except he was waaay worse at avoiding sacks, senses pressure when it's not there.    Arm talent is there, athletic frame/skills, but watching tape I really question if he has it in the head.  With the right coach I'm sure maybe I can potential see it working out, but not in STL."

StLouisRams,2wsnur,Ethanhekker,43,Sun Feb 22 20:56:27 2015 UTC,In my mind Scherff is by far the best o-line prospect and we can put him in a position of great need for us.
StLouisRams,2wsnur,TGMurray,12,Sun Feb 22 21:54:22 2015 UTC,Going O line first round two years in a row has turned the cowboys o line from a joke to hands down best on the league. I'm all for Scherf in the first.

StLouisRams,2wsnur,richhomieram,4,Mon Feb 23 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"I expect us to re-sign McLeod and I'm very sure Britt will stay. If Quick is healthy we don't need any more WRs. We could use depth at ILB, but I wouldn't consider it a need."
StLouisRams,2wsnur,helpimnaked,2,Mon Feb 23 07:16:44 2015 UTC,"Signing McLeod to an extension should be a priority. He's improved every season so far in his career, going from good special teamer his rookie year, to bad starting FS/average slot CB in year 2, to now being an average or maybe even above average FS in his third year. We can probably get him cheap since he isn't a big name and if he continues to improve and hits his prime, McLeod and McDonald will be a terror for opposing offenses for years. Just ask Denver's WRs."

StLouisRams,2wsnur,JG-Wentworth-,11,Sun Feb 22 22:03:08 2015 UTC,I just feel after watching more videos on him he is a scheme QB and would have to be drafted in the right system to succeed. I think if he could sit back and learn for a year or two on the Rams to succeed but those days of a top QB being drafted then groomed are gone. There would be too much pressure to start him and would rush his development stunting his growth. I think he could be a good QB just too risky of a picks for the Rams at this stage
StLouisRams,2wsnur,DabDastic,3,Sun Feb 22 22:06:02 2015 UTC,Why are you getting downvoted for a legit and well explained opinion?
StLouisRams,2wsnur,ayanak27,2,Mon Feb 23 06:17:58 2015 UTC,"Because reddit's sports subreddits have way too many homers that will upvote or downvote something based soley on their homer opinion.   It's the same thing we do for Bradford, we think he's great. Others can't understand why he's here, in real life he's injury prone... And we need more options. I'm starting to come around to liking Winston, he is by far and away the best QB in this draft... And I guarantee he'll go 1 overall.   Edit: I know I went from logical to crazy... But you watch."

StLouisRams,2wsnur,DabDastic,3,Tue Feb 24 01:18:12 2015 UTC,If he can stay out of trouble he will be a top 10 maybe even top 5 NFL receiver
StLouisRams,2wsnur,DabDastic,4,Mon Feb 23 04:30:40 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand that. He was not particularly good in college, yet somehow he's going to be a superstar in the NFL where plays are far more complex (one of his problems), competition is much higher, and he'll have a huge amount of money burning a hole in his pocket (given his history of poor personal decisions)?"
StLouisRams,2wsnur,DiscoJer,1 point,Mon Feb 23 05:41:57 2015 UTC,Well he didn't have a great or even good QB throwing to him in college. He's a physical monster. There's a reason he was the #1 recruit in the country.

StLouisRams,2wsnur,letram13,2,Mon Feb 23 00:59:42 2015 UTC,"I have nfl replay or rewind, whatever its called. I'm at week 9 right now. Austin Davis is really really bad."
StLouisRams,2wsnur,MaxnJaxnWaxnFlaxn,2,Mon Feb 23 14:00:10 2015 UTC,Well if people are mentioning Winston(who has very little chance of being there when we pick and we wouldn't take him if he were) then I will go Amari Cooper(WR from 'Bama) as my choice of ideal pick who has almost zero chance of being available for us when we pick but still...
StLouisRams,2wsnur,AintEzBnWhite,2,Mon Feb 23 01:30:07 2015 UTC,Why do you say even if Winston is there we STILL don't pick him? We obviously can't rely on Bradford as much as we want too. Other then winston its a crap shoot this year. We could be in the same position. After hearing concerns about Hundley I checked into the the UCLA subreddit and there seems to be a lot of doubts about him in there as well. If he's there they have to grab him.
StLouisRams,2wsnur,DabDastic,2,Tue Feb 24 01:14:40 2015 UTC,"If white, cooper or one of the QBs arent there trade down and accumulate and extra 2nd and more.  Stay away from DGB, I would like Agholor with one of the 2nd rounders. Grab the bpa at our trade down spot among cb, ol or lb."
StLouisRams,2wsnur,bozo7337,2,Tue Feb 24 17:34:00 2015 UTC,I'd be so freaking happy if we drafted Danny Shelton even though it's not a position of need. Though it'd make sense if we decide not to bring back Brockers after next season.
StLouisRams,2wsnur,bwc_28,2,Sun Feb 22 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"Clemmings or White realistically at 10, not a fan of Scherff at all."
StLouisRams,2wsnur,ITameFatGirls,2,Mon Feb 23 00:13:40 2015 UTC,We really can't do this without knowing what the top ten picks are going to be.  I'll make a list of names though:  Kevin White  Brandon Scherff  Vic Beasly  La'El Collins  Dorial Green Beckham

StLouisRams,2wrvhe,Jewmangi,3,Sun Feb 22 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"I'd be happy if we re-signed Britt    They should have resigned Britt months ago.  It is looking like he wants to test the free agent market and while I still think he is most likely to sign with us, I bet it costs us more to sign him now than it would have back in October or November.   Back then the consensus was that he would be with us in 2015, a central piece of what was developing into a solid if unspectacular WR corps, and now we're hoping he'll return."
StLouisRams,2wrvhe,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Sun Feb 22 22:43:23 2015 UTC,I'd be extremely surprised if white fell to ten. I'm beginning to doubt that Cooper will be there. However if white is there then they'd better sprint up to the stage with his name card in hand.
StLouisRams,2wrvhe,fake_sagan,4,Sun Feb 22 20:07:53 2015 UTC,I say draft more WVU receivers more the merrier!
StLouisRams,2wrvhe,DrSkittles24,2,Sun Feb 22 20:16:46 2015 UTC,Everyone was clamoring for a receiver last year too. I honestly don't believe it's in our best interest to go after a WR early in the draft and there is no way we get any of those 5. Load up on OL talent 2 of the first 3 rounds and grab a QB in the other. Our line was 31st in the league last year. I don't care who we have to throw to if our passer(s) can't stay upright.
StLouisRams,2wrvhe,The_Wayward,2,Mon Feb 23 15:20:34 2015 UTC,More realistic WR Id like them to look at Cecil Shorts

StLouisRams,2wl5is,xKeyNin,25,Fri Feb 20 20:59:34 2015 UTC,How about 5 years vet minimum with no guaranteed money? He is living in a fucking fantasy if he thinks he's getting a long term deal at his current rate.

StLouisRams,2wl5is,dr_genius,5,Tue Feb 24 21:09:55 2015 UTC,"Not that surprising, Bradford is one lucky guy, his agent knows his demand is high due to the horribleness that is out there at QB, he'll either get paid in STL or paid elsewhere, win win."
StLouisRams,2wl5is,ITameFatGirls,0,Sat Feb 21 00:03:40 2015 UTC,"this is the correct answer.  The knee-jerk reaction is to call him a d-bag (which actually i think he kinda is but i thought that years ago) but the reality of the nfl is that injury and inaction do NOT weigh as heavily as potential talent when it comes to the QB position, and he's also gotten a lot of controversy points, which plays well with the media and is good for the team regardless of it's negative connotation.  His agents understand this and that the NFL is starving for any real talent they can find, and clearly they have specific requirements for looking at talent because they see it in him despite his ridiculously small game totals.  The fact is that statistically he's in the top 10-15 nfl qb's when he's at his best and teams will pay for the hope they get his good years.  its really all a gamble, but frankly i hope we pass and someone else pays him to ride the bench with a cast on."
StLouisRams,2wl5is,jratreddit,1 point,Sat Feb 21 05:03:17 2015 UTC,knee-jerk reaction is to call him a d-bag (which actually i think he kinda is but i thought that years ago)   Based on what exactly?
StLouisRams,2wl5is,bwc_28,5,Sun Feb 22 09:15:30 2015 UTC,"Bradford needs to stop letting his agent do the talking for him. I realize that athletes have limited career lengths and should strive for as much money as possible, when its available. But he also has a responsibility to be a decent person and realize that he owes the Rams organization something for paying him 50 plus million for little return so far. He should man up and take a pay cut, if he is not willing to do that he should be traded and the Rams should move on."
StLouisRams,2wl5is,houseofpayne55,7,Fri Feb 20 22:01:10 2015 UTC,"Bradford got his knee shredded twice while playing for the Rams.  He's probably going to be crippled in that leg when he's 50. He's made a ton of money, true, but he's paid for it physically."
StLouisRams,2wl5is,DiscoJer,9,Sat Feb 21 01:53:20 2015 UTC,"The Rams weren't paying him to sit on the bench injured the past two years. He has  been paid 20 million plus the past two years to play 4 1/2 regular season games and rehab his knee. The Rams owe Bradford absolutely nothing, and he owes us everything. I understand getting injured sucks for Bradford, but he does not deserve to be paid like a top ten QB, like he is basically demanding."
StLouisRams,2wl5is,houseofpayne55,3,Sat Feb 21 02:16:15 2015 UTC,He got paid so much because he was a fantastic quarterback in college and we thought he'd be good in the nfl. The Rams don't owe him and he doesn't owe the Rams.
StLouisRams,2wl5is,Wasted-talent,2,Sat Feb 21 18:44:36 2015 UTC,"He owes us for paying him more than any other rookie in NFL history and sticking with him when tons of other teams would've said ""fuck off."" Half the reason he's such a hot commodity is because Fish and Snead keep talking him up.

And you still want to sit there and get paid like a top 10 QB when you haven't even taken us to the playoffs, that's ridiculous. I know our offensive line and receivers really haven't been the greatest, but wouldn't you want to go out there and prove yourself to everyone. I know people are comparing it to ""well at my job if I have guaranteed money I'm keeping it"". But wouldn't you feel like a pile of shit if you show up to work half as much as other people do, and still expect to get paid equal or more than your co-workers?"

If he agrees to a cut, goes out there and gets hit and his career is over...he's given up millions of dollars for what?  His earning potential as an NFL quarterback is gone.    Take the amount of money involved out of the equation and apply it to your career:    Boss:  ""Robby, we know we owe you a guarenteed amount of dollars, but we would like you to take a fraction of that for the good of the company.   We both know you've missed some time with some health problems the last few years...but as long as those don't pop back up again, you'll get close to we we promised we would pay you in the first place.  We'll spend a portion of that cash that you give back to upgrade the benefits of everybody else, and you'll benefit from those improvements yourself!""

StLouisRams,2wl5is,thegarbageboy,1 point,Sat Feb 21 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like that right now, but its way too early to say that. Bridgewater and Manziel were both a lock to go in the top 5 this time last year.  Over the next 2 and a half months, Winston and Mariota are going to have their games overanalyzed to death. They will question whether Mariota can play in a pro style offense. They will look at how many INTs Winston threw, not to mention his off the field behavior. Some other player will shoot up the boards after running fast in his underwear.  I also wouldn't rule out the Rams trading up. If one of the top 2 QBs makes it to #5, I think they'd be crazy not to."
StLouisRams,2wl5is,CJW1215,-2,Fri Feb 20 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"good for him. there's a huge demand for quarterbacks and with him you're getting a known quantity that isn't a complete disaster on the field (barring injuries). nfl careers are short and dangerous and he should squeeze as much as he possibly can from it. i'd like to see him back in stl if only because we have no other option, but i don't hold this against him. he doesn't owe anybody shit when it's him putting his health on the line every down."
StLouisRams,2wl5is,bwc_28,0,Sat Feb 21 17:27:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. People don't understand that its not about the money. Its about securing a contract that has value beyond this year.
StLouisRams,2wm29p,JETStheBest,14,Sat Feb 21 01:34:18 2015 UTC,Davis will get a lot of mixed reactions around here. He showed promise at times. Has a decent arm and is mobile. Ran the offense well at times and could be a stop gap in the immediate future and possible an answer long term with coaching.   He did however have some runs where he made really bad decisions. I think the last tally he ended up giving up 7 defensive touchdowns(4 int and 3 fumbles). This can be written off as he is young and our line really was bad this past year and didn't help him or Hill out much.   TLDR: He has potential but is young and needs to be coached up. He made a lot of young guy mistakes and also made a lot of young guy big plays. Won a few games and cost us a few games.
StLouisRams,2wm29p,bozo7337,5,Sat Feb 21 02:13:28 2015 UTC,Has a decent arm   One of the biggest knocks on him is his lack of arm strength actually.
StLouisRams,2wm29p,bwc_28,8,Sat Feb 21 07:18:28 2015 UTC,"On the hail mary vs the cardinals in the thursday night game, shaun hills throw fell pretty short. Me and my friends watching the game wondered why Davis didn't take the throw if Hill's fell so short, but the coaches see them throw every day in practice and definitely know who can get it farther. If Hill's weak throw was the best we could do, then davis must be worse.  My personal opinion is fuck it, give the ball to hekker"
StLouisRams,2wm29p,Zeebledelphia,1 point,Sat Feb 21 09:54:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of what arm strength has to do with is how hard and fast they can get a ball somewhere, not just how deep they can throw. Hill doesn't have the best arm strength either but with Austin being a gunslinger type QB he really needs good arm strength for the risks he takes. He can't get balls through the tight spaces he throws into fast enough."
StLouisRams,2wm29p,m_fromm,0,Sat Feb 21 18:57:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I said decent not good or strong. He can make a lot of throws but doesn't have the arm to make all the throws. I personally think the kid will be a career backup, like Hill, who can come in and give a few good games but not sustain it over the long run."
StLouisRams,2wm29p,bozo7337,5,Sat Feb 21 13:57:13 2015 UTC,I love the kid's guts. And he plays with heart and fire. But there's a reason why he could barely make the team.
StLouisRams,2wm29p,ramslife39,3,Sat Feb 21 04:43:09 2015 UTC,"Because in the NFL, unless you are a heralded rookie, you rarely get a shot to start, and if you do and screw it up, you won't get another.  Better to stick with a QB you know is terrible, than take a chance on someone else. At least that seems to be how the NFL operates..."
StLouisRams,2wm29p,DiscoJer,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:14:10 2015 UTC,"As a Jets fan, I can confirm this is true."
StLouisRams,2wm29p,shane_c,5,Sun Feb 22 14:31:16 2015 UTC,"I think with a good offensive line he could be a good quarterback. He played early in the year when the team was playing the worst, especially the O line. No quarterback could have played well under that condition.  I think Fisher knows this and I think he will at least be on the team. And if he's just on the team he may get another shot"
StLouisRams,2wm29p,NewBroPewPew,2,Sat Feb 21 05:17:51 2015 UTC,Mixed bag of crazy. Take the Seattle game the one we won. He balled out hardcore. Scored a lot of plays. Made some reallllllly impressive plays. Even had a 80+ yard drive very late in the game ending in a TD that put us ahead. He also had some really bad plays all season. When it comes down to it he looked like a rookie  out there at times. But our O-Line at times were getting manhandled and Schotties offense wasn't set up for quick games like the Pats. On top of that to often our run game stalled.  So for a few games all we had was a young QB dropping back everyone in the stadium knew they would be passes and non of the routes were quick routes. So to answer you......we don't know. I don't think many QB could have done to well in the times Davis struggled but he also gave D's a lot of TD's something someone like Bradford wouldn't have done.  Keep in mind he was on pace to have a mirrored season of Brett Farves First Season. That is what gives me hope about his future if he gets another shot and has a better opportunity.
StLouisRams,2wm29p,Yji,4,Sat Feb 21 15:08:56 2015 UTC,"He's pretty bad as far as starters go. His highs are really high, but you can't fix the many major issues he does have, so his lows will always be very very low and frequent."
StLouisRams,2wm29p,bretris,2,Sat Feb 21 03:12:46 2015 UTC,Schotty's offense was incredibly complicated to master. I wouldn't be surprised if this factored in to a lot of those lows.

StLouisRams,2wm29p,Yji,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:08:15 2015 UTC,"Too short, can't see the field, which makes him miss open receivers and not see defenders waiting to pick him off. Very elongated, awkward throwing motion. Weak arm, doesn't have the arm strength. Poor mechanics and footwork. Sees ghosts, always bailing from the pocket even with no pressure there. Shaky accuracy and questionable decision making. He has other issues but those are his major ones.  All of these are very concerning issues, and while some can be corrected, pretty much all of them are required to be a good QB and it'd take years to fix his issues to where he's a quality starting QB capable of taking us to the playoffs."
StLouisRams,2wm29p,Darknight622,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:20:16 2015 UTC,"I am not a fan of starting the guy unless he makes major improvements and I mean major, but I just didn't see a lot of the same problems you are seeing. I saw the missing open receivers boiled down to not enough time to establish himself in the pocket before getting sacked or having to scramble due to our garbage line. The ghost he was seeing I only really start noticing once we started playing teams with a good pass rush and he had to always be watching his back because he usually was about to get hit, see the chiefs game.  His major flaws for me are arm strength and throwing motion which can be corrected with coaching. I think we can agree on one thing though regardless of how we see most of the flaws the two we agree on are killers for a QB if they aren't corrected."
StLouisRams,2wm29p,Yji,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:34:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe I see more than what is there, but he does have flaws. The flaws you bring up are tough to fix, it can take years to fix throwing motion and arm strength. It's not so simple, it's changing muscle memory."

Also, his first three years were spent at DE, with only his last two at RT. I'm not sure how much actual research they did for this article or if they're just throwing out names."
StLouisRams,2wcdff,MANUTD4LYFE,7,Wed Feb 18 19:29:24 2015 UTC,What the Rams gave Sam's agent permission to do was to talk to other teams that might be in the QB market so they can gauge Sams value if he were to hit the open market. Both sides are interested in doing this so they can work on a possible extension/restructure.
StLouisRams,2wcdff,bozo7337,1 point,Thu Feb 19 05:33:15 2015 UTC,"It has to be this. Maybe they sent him on a fools errand so he can get a harsh dose of his real dollar value from other teams. It's a smart move on the Rams part if they think Sam is overvaluing his own worth. No team would ever pay him $16 million next year. Not the Rams, not any of the other 31 teams.  So trading Bradford is so far out of the question it's absurd to even mention it.  He would get plenty of offers if he was cut, sure.  But a couple, $5 million guaranteed tops.  That's literally it. He hasn't played for a year and a half.  Trading him of course means the recipient pays him his current contract.  Nobody's willing to do that, much less give up anything of value in return."

StLouisRams,2wcdff,DeniseDeNephew,2,Thu Feb 19 02:17:21 2015 UTC,"Whether this story is true or not, does a player's agent need his team's permission to seek a trade?   The agent and player can't execute a trade of course, but why couldn't an agent make inquiries?  It's not tampering for a player to look for another place to play, and any team can make their own trade offer at any time (even after the trading deadline they can extend the offer even if it can't be accepted at that time).so what does this even mean?   If true is it just a way to send a message, a kind of hardball negotiation tactic?"
StLouisRams,2wcdff,bozo7337,2,Wed Feb 18 21:41:37 2015 UTC,Yes it's tampering if a team talks to a player/agent that is under contract with another team without that teams permission. Heavy fines and draft picks lost will result.
StLouisRams,2wcdff,DeniseDeNephew,1 point,Wed Feb 18 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"Aren't you describing the opposite of what we're talking about?   Tampering rules are for teams, not players, unless I'm mistaken.  That's why the Patriots filed tampering charges against the Jets when the Jets owner talked about wanting to sign Darrelle Revis, because a team expressed interest in signing him before the approved time.  But couldn't Revis walk around wearing a Jets hat and/or tell reporters that he'd like to play for the Jets?  What if Sam was seen wearing a Jets hat, is that tampering?    The tampering rules don't really seem to cover this scenario:   Clubs are further advised that prior to the beginning of the new League Year it is impermissible for a club to enter into an agreement of any kind, express or implied, oral or written, or promises, undertakings, representations, commitments, inducements, assurances of intent or understandings of any kind concerning the terms or conditions of employment offered to, or to be offered to, any prospective Unrestricted Free Agent for inclusion in a Player Contract after the start of the new League Year. Any announcement of an agreement or an agreement in principle by a club or another party, including, but not limited to, a certified agent, player, or media organization may subject the club to a tampering investigation.   If Sam's agent proposes a trade that let's say the Bills find acceptable that's not an agreement of any kind, it's not the same as negotiating an agreement with a player who is a free agent.    It also wouldn't violate this:   Any announcement of an agreement or an agreement in principle by a club or another party, including, but not limited to, a certified agent, player, or media organization may subject the club to a tampering investigation.   Because again, there is no agreement and there CAN'T be an agreement between any other team and Sam.  All Sam's agent can do is listen to an offer and then pass it along to Snead, he's got no actual power the way he would if Sam were a FA.    I suppose it's not important given Snead's more recent comments but what the hell else is there to talk about this time of year?"

StLouisRams,2wa5js,price-iz-right,4,Wed Feb 18 08:17:04 2015 UTC,"I think mccown had success against us because our team hadn't adapted to Greg Williams' D scheme at that point. Also we didn't have Barron at that point either. Our D is effective because of the pass rush...our pass rush is effective with succesful blitz masking by CB, S, LB etc. If you notice, we didn't start clicking on D until around week 5-6....the first part of our season this sub was, rightfully, filled with complaints about our lack of pass rush effectiveness.   IMO Mccown is run of the mill, and if we had played TB or MIN in later weeks of our season we would have crushed them on defense."
StLouisRams,2wa5js,alderaan_never4get,3,Wed Feb 18 08:52:18 2015 UTC,"IMO Mccown is run of the mill   If we don't over pay him, that's exactly what we need to back up Sam.

StLouisRams,2wa5js,alderaan_never4get,2,Wed Feb 18 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe Sanchez. I think we should throw a little more money at a back up QB in a real chance that Bradford goes down again. Hill was ok, but honestly we can do better. I want someone who can make big plays with real starting experience. Austin was horribly inconsistent and is really a 3rd string talent that showed weakness once offenses figured him out. I think we spend a little bit on a QB, then spend a lot on O-line whether that means resigning Barksdale, finding a good center and guard, or drafting some really good prospects. Throw in a decent receiver early on in the 2nd and I think we might be in good shape.   If we let Bradford walk as it seems to be a possibility then we REALLY need to make a big decision on a QB like making that trade for Foles.  But I'm no GM and I don't pretend to be. I put my faith in Fish and Snead and throw it up to chance which is all we as fans can really do."
StLouisRams,2wa5js,price-iz-right,1 point,Thu Feb 19 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I like the idea of Sanchez as a backup, especially due to Bradford's unknown health, but Sanchez is going to want starter money and a starter job. If we throw too much money on him we risk not having enough for our seriously shitty O line.  IMO, what makes most sense to me is re-signing Hill for cheap (he's got the system down and rythmn with WRs already) and throwing everything we have at O line. I mean everything...our WRs, RBs, and D are fine as it stands. Hill would have performed much better behind a competent o line.  Basically our philosophies shift at what we think is the most important hole on our team. I honestly feel Hill, maybe even Davis with some more experience, can perform at an acceptable level behind a competent o line. Bradford can excel behind a competent o line. Our biggest problem right now, IMO, is O line. A healthy Bradford last year wouldn't have helped our season standings because our problem was always time for a QB to throw."
StLouisRams,2wa5js,alderaan_never4get,2,Thu Feb 19 02:24:45 2015 UTC,"enough for our seriously shitty O line.   I wouldn't say shitty as much as I'd say incomplete. There's a lot of young talent, but we have some major holes in guard and center. If we keep Long, which probably won't happen, and resign Barksdale which we need to do, then we have Long, Robinson, no one at center, Saffold, and Barksdale. That's solid but there are some definite question marks. Three that come to mind are Long and Saffold's health, and Robinson's development. We still need to add depth in the draft and free agency. You're absolutely right the bottom line is that we have to improve our o-line.    IMO, what makes most sense to me is re-signing Hill for cheap (he's got the system down and rhythm with WRs already)   I'd agree if we still had Schotty, but you forget that we're entering a new system with a simplified offense under Cignetti. Doesn't mean Hill wouldn't have the advantage of previously working with Cig, but I think youth and longevity with a fresh start would go a lot longer if we moved on past a rapidly aging Hill."
StLouisRams,2wa5js,price-iz-right,1 point,Thu Feb 19 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"If Davis had more time behind an improved o line we can speculate he wouldn't force those untimely throws that were his downfall this year. Add to that a simplified offense maybe Davis could look better? He's young and healthy.  Basically I'm saying if we are going all in on Bradford we need to accept that fact...so much speculating in this sub because it's all us poor bastards have, but bottom line our money is already spent on our QB.   Anyone behind Bradford will be a bottom tier QB2, or a QB3, just like last year. Bradford is ""our guy"" whether we like it or not. I simply don't think there is another QB out there that we can realistically pick up that will be able to produce on or past Bradford's level. If there was wouldn't we have picked this QB up and restructured Bradford's contract or sent Bradford out the door?  Fish and Snead rolled the dice on this one, I really hope they know what they're doing. My ideology behind football has always been ""if my dumbass can figure this shit out on my couch, these guys making millions of dollars have already figured it out and have 3 plans for it."" All I can do is twiddle my thumbs in the meantime...fucking-A I want some footage of Bradford training or something...these guys have got to be seeing something we aren't if they so vehemently stick to him."

Add to that a simplified offense maybe Davis could look better?   That's a real possibility but I think we should let him fight it out in training camp with someone who has the experience to match the talent. Austin looked lost at the end of his run as the starter.    I simply don't think there is another QB out there that we can realistically pick up that will be able to produce on or past Bradford's level.    I'm definitely in agreement there. All I'm saying is we should try to invest a little more into a solid backup. There isn't a ton of great prospect out there this year, but we don't need Aaron Rodgers to carry a clipboard for us. We can, however do better than Hill and Austin I believe.    I want some footage of Bradford training or something...these guys have got to be seeing something we aren't if they so vehemently stick to him.   I think the proof is what we've seen. The talent is there, but he just can't stay healthy plain and simple. Prior to this season I think they thought it would be a wasted pick to find someone early in the draft to pick for QB when we have Bradford on a monster contract, especially since we have so many holes in other places like the o-line."

StLouisRams,2wa5js,bozo7337,3,Wed Feb 18 14:13:53 2015 UTC,For a 5th round pick or so sure. There are no QBs out there worth investing a lot of resources in.
StLouisRams,2wa5js,price-iz-right,4,Wed Feb 18 16:57:08 2015 UTC,"I question whether Barrett Jones can play in the NFL. If he was capable of playing Center or Guard then he should have been put in last year for either Wells or Joseph, who by most rankings were among the 2 or 3 worst in the league at their positions. I'd love it if he was the answer but Fisher not putting him in last year raises question marks.    As for free agents Houston or Wisniewski both would be great signings. And there are 3 or 4 players we could draft in the first three rounds that could start from day one."
StLouisRams,2wa5js,The_Wayward,2,Wed Feb 18 16:12:58 2015 UTC,"I read ""Wells and Joseph"" and just had a flash of rage. Every fucking time (well almost) our QBs were touched, hurried, or sacked this year it was one of those two bastards' fault. Whether it was being too slow on the block, being too weak and getting bullrushed, or worse COMPLETELY MISSING ASSIGNMENTS...it was so easy to scan the replay and see Wells or Joseph with fucking hands on their hips watching as their assigned man creams ole noodle arm Hill. God damn that pissed me off...  You are right. If this guy was decent he would have beaten either of these two goons in the starting line up. If Wells and Joseph were the best we had to offer, we are seriously fucked next year unless we start making moves in the FA and draft."
StLouisRams,2wa5js,helpimnaked,2,Thu Feb 19 06:08:05 2015 UTC,Hudson out of KC is another option at center. I doubt the Chiefs have the space to keep him either. Great young player we could lock up for 4-5 years.
StLouisRams,2wa5js,m_fromm,2,Wed Feb 18 14:57:38 2015 UTC,"I'd like to sign Bulaga as well, addressing OLine starters in free agency. Also this is under the assumption that Barksdale stays in town. Our line needs work and this draft class is particularly weak on offensive line prospects."

I believe we will get Scherff, Collins, or maybe even Peat in the first. All 3 can play guard IMO. I also think if Long wants to be a Ram, he is gonna have to restructure, and move to either guard or RT. It seems Fish is pretty set on Robinson being LT from day one. A very good OLine  can make an average QB look pretty good IMO."
StLouisRams,2wa5js,helpimnaked,2,Wed Feb 18 06:00:12 2015 UTC,"I think taking a guard at #10 might be a little extreme, maybe if they decide to use one of those players for RT.

StLouisRams,2wbztm,BrawndoTTM,2,Wed Feb 18 20:50:36 2015 UTC,Grayson would be a draft pick.

StLouisRams,2w4of7,Noobguy27,3,Fri Feb 20 03:24:03 2015 UTC,I would bet the next expansion team will be called the Dragons.
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Wm_TheConqueror,2,Fri Feb 20 11:55:54 2015 UTC,Absolutely. At the same time who knows if Kroenke was just using LA as a bargaining chip. The way I look at it is that the Raiders play in a baseball stadium and the Chargers have been asking for a new stadium for 14 years. All the while St. Louis has been giving a concerted effort into a building a new stadium. And now the Chargers and Raiders are trying to move to LA too. Very interesting.
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Popolar,5,Fri Feb 20 03:20:46 2015 UTC,"That's precisely what I have been saying. Kronke could have just said his plans involve building a stadium in LA just so that STL speeds up the process. It makes a lot more sense to move the raiders and chargers into LA considering their stadium situations.   Again, as I said before, a rams move to LA is still in the cards. Keeping options open is good business."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Musingmike,-4,Fri Feb 20 05:58:51 2015 UTC,Except it is a clear bargaining move. It isn't a serious plan. Come on. People have to be smarter than this...
StLouisRams,2w4of7,amawg9,6,Fri Feb 20 16:52:24 2015 UTC,They bought the land...
StLouisRams,2w4of7,bnsaluki,7,Fri Feb 20 17:52:46 2015 UTC,Really? Because those cities clearly don't have the funds to put up.  I've covered this thing long enough to be 99.9% sure the Chargers and Raiders aren't getting publicly funded stadiums in their home markets.
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Kaos047,8,Fri Feb 20 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"STL is also so much further along with the stadium plans than either of those cities are. STL has at least shown its putting a real effort in, where SD and Oakland have not."

StLouisRams,2w4of7,TheDuke13,-2,Fri Feb 20 04:18:53 2015 UTC,"This is a proposal that won't likely happen. Inglewood is much further along and almost about to break ground, not to also mention that these two teams are in the same division. There is no way in hell the NFL would let that happen and I highly doubt there will be a realignment."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Minnesota_Slim,11,Fri Feb 20 14:03:40 2015 UTC,"Although true that Kroenke is further ahead in his plans, I can see it on the opposite way as well.   Right now St. Louis is further ahead than Oakland and San Diego in providing their respective teams with a new stadium plan. So in a year, say Kroenke still rejects St. Louis to go to LA. San Diego and Oakland can speak up and say - woah, we have plans to go to LA too.... Except our cities do not have well developed plans for us to stay in our respective cities. In the meantime, Kroenke is walking away from St. Louis who has a stadium deal on the table.   I can see the play of... Why should Kroenke be able to move and walk away from a deal on the table. While Oakland and San Diego want to walk away but they don't even have a plan on the table like Kroenke."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,TheDuke13,6,Fri Feb 20 14:53:28 2015 UTC,While it's possible that may happen I just don't see Kroenke building a stadium and not putting his team in it. There's also no way for the NFL to stop him if he decides to force his hand and move without the votes. Yes there are anti trust laws in place but it didn't stop Al Davis or Georgia Frontiere from moving without approval. Al Davis moved to LA suing the NFL for collusion on the LA market. I just don't see how Stan doesn't win that case if it's ever brought to court.
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Minnesota_Slim,5,Fri Feb 20 14:57:32 2015 UTC,It's all very interesting. Is Kroenke REALLY going to follow through and build this stadium or was it just a push to get St. Louis moving - I can see it both ways.  Then if the stadium is the real deal and he is building it - I'm going to enjoy the showdown between Kroenke and the NFL.

StLouisRams,2w4of7,yeepperg,7,Wed Feb 25 11:18:26 2015 UTC,This vote changed nothing.  It was a mere formality.  Dont know why anyone thinks otherwise.  The Carson stadium plan will be approved in the same way in the next few months.  Only Silent Stan knows if they are actually moving.  He can always back out if St. Louis actually funds the new stadium and develop the land in Inglewood in some other way.
StLouisRams,2w4of7,ImTheBestMayne,3,Wed Feb 25 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, why in the world would they have voted against it? Of course the council would approve such a large privately funded development that could potentially bring in so much money. I don't understand why people are acting like this is the deciding factor."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,TheDuke13,4,Wed Feb 25 20:16:16 2015 UTC,"Probably because after 20 years of talk about having a stadium built but only when a team has committed to moving here, a stadium is being built, privately funded without a commitment from a team. Oh and also the guy paying for it happens to own a professional football franchise."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,asheepysheep,2,Thu Feb 26 16:22:56 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that this vote passing allowed for some permits and applications and other legal stuff to be bypassed, and help break ground on construction faster.

StLouisRams,2w4of7,eight26,-2,Thu Feb 26 16:49:46 2015 UTC,The Carson plan is nothing like this. Carson is going to a public vote that is a much longer timeline. The land deal in Carson is not finalized either.

When sufficient signatures are in hand, the stadium initiative can be approved by a vote of the Carson City Council or put to a public election. The involved parties hope to complete the process by June.   Guess which way they go with?  Also, this involves no public money so it will win in a landslide.  As far as the land deal: Mark Fabiani, the Chargers point man has repeatedly stated that the land is now owned by both teams and that there are no contingencies attached to the sale (as in ""If the city votes for approval,"" etc.).  Its supposedly in escrow right now.   They have been working on this whole thing for a year. The only thing that was rushed was the actual stadium plan because their usual architect was busy on another project."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Mister_Dane,-5,Wed Feb 25 17:20:00 2015 UTC,"It's been set in stone since the arbitration case. But now we have reached the point where it is certain publicly that the Rams are moving back to LA. Construction on the property has already begun and the actual stadium construction begins in December. The only thing pending is league approval, which isn't actually required by anti-trust laws."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,flyingsqrl24,2,Wed Feb 25 11:22:00 2015 UTC,Damn that's unfortunate =/ so this will be the last year of the st Louis rams then. No way they move before the season right? Also I read that the LA stadium won't be finished till 2018 so I can't imagine them staying here until then.

There are a lot of complicated issues for getting the financing done. But you continue to twist the words - legislation just said we want a say in it. Also, the reason the KC side is very hesitant about building a stadium is because they built the Spring Center thinking some professional sports team would come. That's why you don't build it and hope they come. You wait until someone agree's to lease it, then build it - which is what the people behind the STL project want."

StLouisRams,2w4of7,ajswdf,11,Mon Feb 16 23:26:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a tad bit confused.  I thought it was widely assumed the Inglewood council would approve the NFL stadium. Everyone knew it was going to happen.  So, it happened, and now people are saying well, that's it game over. Rams gone. Well if we knew it was going to happen, why wasn't it game over a week ago when we all knew it was going to happen?"
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Kaos047,4,Wed Feb 25 18:00:33 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised by the reaction too. I guess the idea is that before Kroenke couldn't build the stadium, but now he could start putting shovels in the dirt today if he wanted. The only thing stopping him from moving is approval from the league, which many people believe isn't a real barrier (I'm skeptical of that claim, but it's possible he could force his way there)."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,RubyRhod,6,Wed Feb 25 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"LA fans are more disillusion than the STL ones are. Most of them will tell you any piece of news supporting the move the LA means its game over the Rams are gone, and anything supporting the Rams staying in STL is just lies to keep the attendance up next year. Its best to ignore anyone but the news outlets until we have an official announcement one way or the other."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Popolar,8,Wed Feb 25 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as someone who lives in LA and has followed the last 5 or so stadium proposals over the last 10 years, I will not believe it until an official statement says there is a team coming here."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,panderson1988,10,Wed Feb 25 22:35:20 2015 UTC,"Okay, so for those of you who are interested, I thought I might offer a little insight on St. Louis.   Something that is very important to note is that St. Louis is an independent city. This means that it belongs to no particular county.   Why is this important? Well, for one, St. Louis is one of three cities outside of Virginia that is independent. The only other NFL city that is Independent is Baltimore. If you don't live in St. Louis, you wouldn't really know about the difference between the county and the city. Basically, anyone who can move out to the county has already. There are special cases in which people prefer to stay in the city, but the county has a much better economy and a much larger population. The primary reason St. Louis city and St. Louis county have not merged together is because of the state of the city's economy.   Statistics shown about St. Louis city represent a population of about 300,000, whereas the population of St. Louis county is over 1,000,000.   So essentially, statistics shown about the city of St. Louis only represent about a fourth of the local population and a much worse economy.   The fact that St. Louis county will not merge with St. Louis city has given the city's government reason to give benefits to new companies who decide to run their companies out of St. Louis.   So, what the hell does this have to do with the rams? Well, everything actually. St. Louis is setting itself up for major growth as a major city. They want a city-county merger, but that's not going to happen without an improvement to the city's economy. The reason the governor is pushing so hard to keep an NFL team is because the funding the city received from an NFL team is so substantial, especially in the state of the economy that St. Louis is in now. Losing the Rams (or the NFL in general) becomes much more of a financial hurdle for the city in the long run than building a stadium to keep them, considering the direction the city is moving in. Keeping the team they already have is important because there is already an existing fanbase.  TL;DR Keeping the NFL in St. Louis is much more determinant to the city's future than it appears to be  EDIT: spelling"
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Wm_TheConqueror,5,Sat Feb 21 08:53:32 2015 UTC,"Good post, and people who don't live in St Louis don't understand the confusion between St Louis city and St Louis county and how they are separate despite the same name. It's a reason why many during the Ferguson riots thought the swat teams were STL PD when it clearly said STL County PD, but whatever.   Still, I am skeptical to see STL enter a massive growth stage soon. I'm hopeful that would happen like Indianapolis has seen, but it'll be hard. Still, the recent changes in St Louis with the new I-70 bridge across the river, enclosing a part of the highway near the arch grounds, and then Busch Stadium with ""Ball Park Village"" are nice additions. Then add in the growth Soulard has seen, and Washington Street."

If you disagree leave a comment why and don't just downvote me  Personally, and I know the same goes for many other people. I am a STL sports fan. Im not even from STL (Im a Texan), but my dad is a St Louisan(?). For me I root for a team because of what it represents. I root for St. Louis teams bc of the area they represent, not bc I like the franchise (example, Im a Longhorns fan because of where the team is from and what they represent to me (which is pride in where I am from and who I root for))  Now I'm not saying that you only root for teams based on where they are from  I know a lot of you were handed down Rams fandom from parents despite location of the team. You like the Rams based on them representing a tie to your family (You'll probably stay with the Rams pending a move).  But for you LA fans who have fond memories of this team or whatever, say a team moves to LA (not the Rams) you will probably become a fan of that team, whether you realize it or not. You might tell yourself, ""I am a real Rams fan, I would desert my team,"" but the fact of the matter is most would.  My father tells me fond stories of having season tickets to the St Louis (football) Cardinals. But as I've seen in my own family and the greater STL region, once the Cardinals left there was still some Football Cards fans left, but most deserted the team that deserted them. People split between Chicago and KC or baseball and hockey because those were more representative of them. Why stay with them? They left you! What do they represent to now? Yeah there will be emotional ties to earlier success, but you hold on to that as a regional success. Dan dierdorf is more revered in STL than deacon Jones. If the Rams leave the Superbowl victory will stay in STL for (maybe) another team that comes in to take the glory even though the win will belong to the Rams technically   Then the Rams came. St Louis was ecstatic to have a football team represent them again. Its a pride thing  Tl;dr -- if the Rams leave so will the majority of the fanship, myself included because it wont represent us anymore"
StLouisRams,2w4of7,D9-EM,9,Wed Feb 18 14:40:55 2015 UTC,"People who have stuck with the team 20 years after they left LA aren't going to suddenly jump to a new team just because they're in LA. Proximity obviously means nothing to these fans. You seem to think all fans root for teams based on their location despite your acknowledgment that it's not always the case. Hell, I live in Seattle and sure as heck am not becoming a Hawks fan. I grew up in the Bay Area and despise the Niners. There are many fans like me. The fans from CA who still root for the Rams aren't going to start rooting for another team even if one moves to LA."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,bwc_28,8,Tue Feb 17 00:12:47 2015 UTC,"And I believe youre a rare breed. Also in a unique situation of having to root for the same teams you've hated as a fan of the Rams and you're not from STL.  Furthermore like I said, when the Cards left they left behind some fans but not many. Same for the Colts in Baltimore and the Oilers in Houston. Nobody in Houston really became a Titans fan.  Are people in Seattle fans of the Thunder?  May I ask why you are a Rams fan?"

StLouisRams,2w4of7,eight26,1 point,Tue Feb 17 21:55:33 2015 UTC,"Are people in Seattle fans of the Thunder?   The way the NBA essentially gave the middle finger to the fans, everyone here hates the Thunder. My gf refuses to admit they even exist. Many people here despise the entire league because of the way the city got screwed. When the Rams moved it was very different. The NFL didn't want the team to move, it was Frontierre who forced it. I hate her, but not the team obviously.  And I'm a Rams fan because I grew up in So Cal and my uncle played for them. Though he also played for the Pats and I hate them as much as I hate the Niners."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,neltrono,4,Thu Feb 19 06:35:12 2015 UTC,So what do the Rams represent to you besides a football team?  Also is Stan Kroenke not extending a huge middle finger to the city of St. Louis?
StLouisRams,2w4of7,OnAComputer,8,Tue Feb 17 22:15:14 2015 UTC,"They're just a football team, that's it. They're my football team though. I started rooting for them and once I root for a team I don't give up on them. Same with any sport. I have no ties to Newcastle United but they're my team because I happened to watch a movie about the team when I was getting back into soccer. Even despite the fact that the owner of the team is actively trying to run the team into the ground I still root for them. I could easily change allegiances since I don't live in England and have no ties to the team, but I don't do that. I consider team loyalty important. I stick with my teams through thick and thin.  Edit: this is exactly why we can't have actual conversations on this sub and this meta thread was created. The user above me asked me a question and I answered it truthfully and respectfully.

And they aren't leaving the team with out reason. The team no longer represents them so why would they stay with something they no longer really care about.
StLouisRams,2w4of7,OnAComputer,-3,Thu Feb 19 23:26:15 2015 UTC,why would they stay with something they no longer really care about.   Because they still care about the team! You obviously can't comprehend that some people value different things in sports than you. You're so focused on the way you view the world you refuse to acknowledge not everyone sees things the same way.
StLouisRams,2w4of7,eight26,1 point,Thu Feb 19 00:37:23 2015 UTC,"I think you're just ignoring that you are a minority.   Anyways why be loyal to a team that isn't loyal to you as a fan base (that fan base being St Louisans).   I see youre point of view that there are people who follow a team just cause and stick to that team, but the majority of fans follow a team for another reason that a ""just cause"" so their loyalty will not ride on the fact that its ""their team"" but rather on ""this is my fathers team therefore mine"" or ""this is my city therefore my team.""   There have been psychological studies done for marketing that have proven that people become loyal to products based on an internal reason (I.e. Apple is better BECAUSE its easier).   The majority of fanbases are people from the region of a team. In this case the region is St Louis. If a team leaves, yes some will stay fans ""because loyalty and this is my team"" BUT the majority of fans will leave bc they became fans when the team came to STL and they will stop when it leaves (like they did with the STL football Cardinals).   Yes there will be other fans from LA or wherever a team moves. But the fact of the matter is ""Once a Rams fan always a Rams fan"" is not a true statement especially for people in St. Louis and those who support the team because its in St Louis."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,D9-EM,5,Thu Feb 19 01:02:00 2015 UTC,"I never said I wasn't a minority. But the blanket statements you keep making prove that while you might attempt to talk about fans with differing opinions than yours you truly don't understand them, or really even acknowledge them. You think geographical location is the only important factor to all fans despite people telling you in this thread that it's not. It's ridiculous that you can't see beyond yourself.  I'm also not surprised that the downvote brigade from fans like you is taking over this thread. You can't stand to hear any opinion different than your own, it's pathetic. I'll quote again your statement proving your lack of comprehension regarding fans who stick with a team through thick and thin. I understand and acknowledge why fans like you will abandon the Rams, I might not like it, but I understand it. You refuse to even try to see what other fans think. Stop being so full of yourself, your view isn't the only one that matters.   The team no longer represents them so why would they stay with something they no longer really care about."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,bwc_28,0,Thu Feb 19 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"I think youre missing the entire point of my post. I'm not saying your a lesser person or that you don't exist or that your not important and that location isn't the only thing that is important.  While yes I don't understand why some one would just blindly say ""Hey I like this team even though I have absolutely no ties to it and it doesn't represent me in any facet of being a person and I  disapprove of how it is run and I have no real reason to root for them or have any interest in them I'm going to have a neverdying loyalty to it."" I just don't understand it.  BUT the entire point of my post is that MOST PEOPLE ARENT LIKE YOU   I never said I wasn't a minority.   You even admit it. Location isn't the only reason most people root for the Rams, but how many people do you see walking around Seattle sporting Rams gear. I bet it's not a prevalent as it is in St. Louis. The ST LOUIS Rams fans will hold on to the Superbowl and everything, but they won't care about the team LIKE HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST WITH THE ST LOUIS FOOTBALL CARDINALS!   I stand by my statement as well. The team will no longer represent the city of St. Louis, so those that support the team because it is a St. Louis team will no longer follow the Rams because it no longer represents them as a St. Louisan. People may still follow them because they like the team or a player or the coach or have a familial tie or whatever, but as I said the fact of the matter is the majority of St. Louisans who make up the majority of the St. Louis Rams fanbase will no longer want to be fans of a team that is not in St. Louis.  You don't see people in St. Louis rocking AZ Cardinals gear. Why? Because they arent a St. Louis team. It's too simple. It's all over the radio in St. Louis. Randy Karraker, the ultimate Rams fan, has said he has special plans for his Rams gear if they move. It's just a fact bud. You can't change the fact that it's going to happen. I'm sorry bud. Youre just neglecting it.  It might suck that I don't stick with the Rams for fans like yourself, but it's not because I don't stick with a team through thick and thin. I've been following this team since they moved to St. Louis. I've had my share of ups and downs. I've stuck with them through thick and thin. However if this team moves they are no longer my team so I wont stick with them. If you can't understand that then we'll never see eye to eye.   You think geographical location is the only important factor to all fans despite people telling you in this thread that it's not.   Who? besides you and neltrono."

StLouisRams,2w4of7,Opifex,0,Tue Mar 3 01:32:33 2015 UTC,"One significant point this article seems to miss is how far along St. Louis is in building a new stadium compared to Oakland and San Diego.  It ignores the possibilities of a new team moving to Stl after the rams leave, or a franchise swap to keep the Rams in Stl and Stan moving a different team to LA."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,CallOnTyrone,2,Tue Feb 17 21:48:27 2015 UTC,"Has any report even speculated about the idea of a franchise swap? It sounds completely ludicrous on the surface.  Edit: To further explain the absolute stupidity of the farcical idea of a franchise swap. Forbes ranks St. Louis as the lowest valued franchise, in one of the smallest markets. Oakland ranks 31st in franchise value, San Diego is in the middle of the pack with the 6th largest market. Why would Spanos or Davis consider swapping franchises to a smaller market with fewer fans and the smallest value only to allow Kroenke to move their previous franchise to the 2nd biggest market possibly tripling the value of that franchise? It is so ludicrous it is embarrassing that some fans made this speculation up."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,StraightfromSTL,0,Fri Feb 27 05:11:21 2015 UTC,"This only makes (some) sense for Davis if there is zero possibility of Oakland building a new stadium or him taking his team to LA. Davis would essentially trade equivalent markets (31 to 32.. not a huge difference) for a brand new stadium.  Given that set of circumstances it doesn't seem so ludicrous. May not be worth all the trouble of relocation though.    This is basically the same thing as the Rams just moving to LA and the Raiders moving to StL, and people weren't calling that idea ludicrous. The only difference is the name on the jersey."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,BeefyMcFlaps,0,Fri Feb 27 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"Mark Davis trading the Raiders? That is an astonishing fabrication with no basis in reality. Mark Davis moving the Raiders to St. Louis is also a nonsensical speculation. One thing he will do though is use other cities, possibly St. Louis included, as a threat to try to get support for a small stadium in Oakland. Do you really think The son of Al Davis will trade the proud team his father built only to watch it triple in value for Kroenke to capitalize on? Ridiculous to even speculate about to an extent that it's embarrassing that a St. Louis fans make up this kind of garbage to be able to continue clutching at straws."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,bozo7337,-4,Fri Feb 27 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how many fans in St Louis would be willing to root for a new team in St Louis. So many fans have said they'd switch to the Chiefs or another team if the Rams move. Say the Raiders move to St Louis and the Rams move to LA, would the fans who said they root for the city not the team immediately become Raiders fans? Because that would seem like the most fair solution, as people in St Louis just want a team, not necessarily the Rams. The fans in So Cal want the Rams, not just any team."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,StraightfromSTL,7,Fri Feb 27 14:49:35 2015 UTC,"I think fans in St. Louis want a team that wants to be in St. Louis (and actually acts like it ala the Blues or Cardinals).  The truth is if a franchise wants fan support, there are many ways to go about garnering it outside of just winning, and the current Rams front office makes little effort.  The blues got into top 10 attendance before they started winning by actually reaching out into the community and making an effort.  People point to the Bills or Browns as teams that get support even though they have been bad for so long, but those owners also go out of their way to be a part of the community.  Hell the Jags owner wants to help rebuild the downtown of Jacksonville."

The Edward Jones Dome is one of the worst stadiums in the NFL (at this point it's either a new stadium or LA). The Rams don't get very much support. For example, they were (31st in attendance last year)[http://espn.go.com/nfl/attendance]. The only team below them was the Vikings who are temporarilly playing in a smaller college stadium. For all intents and purposes the Rams were last. And this has been an issue for a while. They were 31st in 2013, 30th in 2012, 31st in 2011, 30th in 2010, etc.  LA is a much bigger city.

StLouisRams,2w4of7,bwc_28,6,Fri Feb 27 06:46:45 2015 UTC,"St. Louis is an amazing sports city. For baseball and hockey. The Rams have a historically bad stretch over the last 10-12 years, and fan support has been dwindling. IMO, if the Rams can start playing like a playoff contender again, the seats will fill up. I live 1.5 hours from the city and 5ish hours from Chicago and Indianapolis. Our stores around here are flooded with Bears and colts gear, while you need to make a trip into the city to find Rams stuff.   Attendance hasn't been high. But I personally don't think it has been awful the last few years (Fisher era). But our owner is a business man that is looking for an even bigger payday, and In my opinion, trying to capitalize on our recent lack of success before we start winning again."

StLouisRams,2w4of7,bozo7337,0,Fri Feb 20 01:23:56 2015 UTC,Found this under your link. Seems to give a different perspective on the fan base in LA. The author gives his viewpoints on how he thinks the Rams will fare if they do indeed move.
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Popolar,3,Tue Feb 24 16:15:44 2015 UTC,"At their zenith in the 1984 season after drubbing Washington in Super Bowl XVIII, they averaged 64,300, only 71% of capacity.   That's more than the Rams have had attendance-wise since 2007. And having a larger stadium automatically makes higher capacity averages more difficult to reach. The author obviously had an angle and picked the numbers he wanted to fit that narrative, hardly convincing."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,bozo7337,2,Wed Feb 25 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"The numbers are better than St. Louis, sure, but its only ~7000 more people with a population advantage. The attendance critique of St. Louis fans in general is skewed because of sample size. It's hard to maintain a great attendance given the product on the field. We can all agree that pre-Fisher was a dark time for the Rams. You had your hardcore fans that would still come to the games, but when you have a team that wins 6 games between 2007-2009, you can't fill seats in a smaller market. This, coupled with having a better performing Baseball/Hockey team doesn't help.  I don't see how getting a higher attendance percentage is harder with only 30k more seats but 6x the population."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Popolar,3,Tue Feb 24 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"you can't fill seats in a smaller market   I think you just argued that St Louis isn't a good fit for the NFL. In all seriousness, there are many factors that go into attendance, you're discounting everything that went into the LA numbers while acknowledging there are factors with the St Louis figures."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,bwc_28,3,Tue Mar 3 04:43:15 2015 UTC,"Well first, you took that quote out of context. He was saying that you can't fill seats in a smaller market when a team is not performing well. You can't even fill seats in a large market if the team is not performing well. That's just basic economics. People don't want to spend money to watch their team lose, LA or STL. STL just has a smaller economy relative to LA.  With STL being an independent city, it's numbers don't properly show just how big it is. The city only has a population of around 320,000, and because it is independent, the excluded county population is 1.001 million. That makes St. Louis city+county the 9th largest in the United States, which is bigger than both Dallas and San Francisco. Every other city on this list aside from Baltimore and Carson City has their respective counties included. I've said this same thing on this thread a few times, but it is such a little known fact that makes so much of a difference, sorry if this annoys anybody.  But LA is still about 3x that population. That being said, stadium attendance average in LA should be higher despite it having a bigger stadium.  Both LA and STL are cities that are capable of having an NFL team, but I think that what that article points out is that moving the Rams away from STL is not the answer to LA not having a team."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Popolar,3,Tue Mar 3 05:14:01 2015 UTC,"Just to play devils advocate here on the attendance should be better in LA. Yes population is 3x St Louis but they also have many more entertainment opportunities. When the Rams and Raiders were in town there were 3 NFL and MLB teams in the area, 2 NBA teams, 2 Hockey teams(Ducks were formed right at the end of their time in LA), UCLA, USC, UCSD, SD State, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, Cal State Fullerton, (just those off the top of my head) all with baseball and basketball and most with football. And that's just the sports entertainment that provides competition. That's a lot of fighting for peoples sports dollars. St Louis has the Cardinals and the Blues and the Rams. A major university? Last I looked Mizzou was closer to KC than St Louis.    I don't have a dog in the fight but simply looking at the difference in population doesn't tell the whole story. I've said it before and I'll say it again, each fan base has supported the Rams well at times. And each has failed to support the Rams at times. I don't live in LA or St Louis, though it would be much easier for me if they were in LA to go to games regularly. You're also taking St Louis' current population vs LA's current population. Not the population when they left twenty years ago."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,BeefyMcFlaps,2,Tue Mar 3 06:28:31 2015 UTC,"I was trying to not bring in other factors because there's literally an endless amount of them, but yes, you are right. LA has a LOT more to do than STL, so their attendance rates being a little low is expected.   However, wouldn't that make St. Louis a better city to have an NFL team? I mean, if there is so much to do in LA and so little (RELATIVE TO LA, there is still plenty to do in STL) to do in STL, wouldn't it make sense to have an NFL team in St. Louis over LA? It seems as though maintaining a fanbase in St. Louis would be a lot easier because there's just not as many major sports teams and major attractions that would keep people from being Rams fans.   I don't know. That's why I was only really looking at population. There's just way too much to look at in the big picture, both LA and STL."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,xKeyNin,1 point,Tue Mar 3 08:15:04 2015 UTC,"Every entertainment, sports or whatever has to market themselves to get people to devote their time and money to them. There are very few businesses that market themselves better than the NFL. One thing also to look at in regards to attendance is how a teams attendance rates vs the NFL average. For many years in LA the Rams were above the NFL average, for most of their years in LA actually. St Louis hasn't historically put up that kind of number. Sorry I really don't like these attendance arguments they're pointless because you're comparing numbers in different era's in different towns and with different team circumstances. It's really pointless this attendance debate."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,Darknight622,1 point,Tue Mar 3 09:04:42 2015 UTC,"Well, that sort of contradicts what you said about there being other attractions in LA, but I understand what you're saying. There really is no use in comparing a stat that is so subjective to so many different variables, let alone the different frames of time."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,mlasn,2,Tue Mar 3 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"People don't want to spend money to watch their team lose, LA or STL.   Other teams have managed to fill their stadiums during bad stretches. Hell, even the Rams during the late 50s and early 60s stayed at the top of NFL attendance figures, despite poor season records. It wasn't until the team moved to Anaheim that attendance dropped. LA supported the Rams even during losing stretches, which is why I hate that excuse from St Louis fans trying to explain away the city's poor support of the team.  During the early 70s LA was putting over 70,000 people in the seats per game. That was during a period when football wasn't nearly as popular as it is currently, yet the LA Rams attendance figures would be in the top 10 today. So their averages were higher. And that's despite far worse traffic and transportation in LA and a much higher population turnover."
StLouisRams,2w4of7,StraightfromSTL,2,Wed Mar 4 00:07:32 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be an excuse if there was something comparable to it, but there's not. The last few years the Rams have had in St. Louis are the worst in the franchise's history. I completely understand that the argument is getting old, and I agree, but it would be a whole different story if the Rams had gone .500 every season and the attendance was still low.   The fact that the Rams have played their worst football in the seasons leading up to people complaining about their attendance percentages  and relocation rumors should speak for itself."
StLouisRams,2w4uni,BilllyMayes,6,Mon Feb 16 23:58:54 2015 UTC,He is an exciting player to watch but it is hard to argue that this was a good draft choice for the Rams. He cost way too much for basically a punt returner. Maybe with a better OC/OL he could be something special but with the speed he has almost no presence in the passing game. I am still optimistic that maybe with a better QB and him improving he will be able to outrun a DB for deep balls.
StLouisRams,2w4uni,mlasn,6,Tue Feb 17 02:39:40 2015 UTC,His size really has been a bit of a hindrance but with the bigger cbs coming into the league to defend the Calvin Johnson like player he absolutely has to be able to outrun them. We need to get him into open field and I saw way to few screens thrown his way and I don't quite understand why. Maybe improve the edge blocking of our receivers?
StLouisRams,2w4uni,mlasn,0,Tue Feb 17 02:57:17 2015 UTC,He is the same height as Steve Smith just like 20lbs less muscle and not much different from Antonio Brown.
StLouisRams,2w4uni,To3z,1 point,Tue Feb 17 05:10:15 2015 UTC,I agree. But Shotty did do a better job last year utilizing Tavon with jet sweeps. Hopefully Cig can keep the momentum going.
StLouisRams,2w4uni,Kuro007,5,Tue Feb 17 13:53:22 2015 UTC,"This is why it is stupid to draft a short wr at the top of the first. Even dumber to trade up for one. How much better off would we be sitting if we took one of the wrs (keenan allen, deandre hopkins) that went after him and then spent that 2nd on a guard? This was one of the major misses of this front office. Luckily we had a plethora of picks to offset it but damn this hurt.  That being said, hes not as bad as bad as maybe im making him out to be. We need to get him and decent qb and start sending him deep where he should flourish. I would also like to see him in the darren sproles role. Third down starting at halfback, motioning him out to get a 1v1 with a linebacker for an easy first.  Heres to hoping he improves as a WR next year."

StLouisRams,2w59zq,FaulktheBlueRedbird,15,Tue Feb 17 02:03:03 2015 UTC,Honestly his valleys were pretty low... not sure I want that kind of player as our QB
StLouisRams,2w59zq,bleedblue89,11,Tue Feb 17 02:30:37 2015 UTC,"I don't really get what you lose from starting Austin Davis over Shaun Hill. Shaun Hill is a career backup, he's not taking this team to a championship. Austin Davis at least has SOME chance at doing something, he's young and he showed great potential. At no point was he really unbearably awful for a first year starter."
StLouisRams,2w59zq,crushh_87,11,Tue Feb 17 02:36:14 2015 UTC,Simplest answer: Fisher felt the hot seat. Better to win 6 or 7 games for sure than gamble on winning either 3 or 10.
StLouisRams,2w59zq,Jewmangi,2,Tue Feb 17 07:03:08 2015 UTC,You lose the other 51 guys in the locker room
StLouisRams,2w59zq,psxpaul,28,Wed Feb 18 00:17:22 2015 UTC,Teams watched a bit of tape on him and he couldn't adjust.  He's not an NFL starter.
StLouisRams,2w59zq,ismizz,8,Tue Feb 17 03:02:45 2015 UTC,"He was too high risk high reward. So ya, sometimes he would sling it and look great. But then the next time down the field he forces another throw but wouldn't get as lucky  Poor man's Brett Favre. Occasional highs, really low lows"
StLouisRams,2w59zq,diesel321,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:43:09 2015 UTC,Give that man a couple of possession receivers and let him sling it!
StLouisRams,2w59zq,Jewmangi,16,Tue Feb 17 07:04:46 2015 UTC,I would honestly disagree and see why they pulled him. It wasn't like he had a bad game here and there. To me it seemed like he had a good start with a bad game mixed in and then teams figured him out and it just went terribly afterwards. After the SEA game he just fell off the planet. I think he is an interesting person to keep around but if I had to bet now my guess is he won't be in the league at all in 2-3 years.
StLouisRams,2w59zq,mlasn,2,Tue Feb 17 02:34:58 2015 UTC,"Fucking this. Jesus the Eagles, 9ers, and chiefs game he was getting all sorts of pressure."
StLouisRams,2w59zq,wubdubdubdub,5,Tue Feb 17 05:53:02 2015 UTC,"I imagine the Rams accepted this team was not going to make the playoffs with Austin Davis at QB, and they pulled him to potentially not destroy his confidence. Yeah he had a few bad games, and what normally happens, especially if the player is young, is they get benched for the safer, older veteran. If you keep Davis in, it could have turn into a domino effect where his games get worse worse (could also do the opposite), but I think the Rams wanted to get him out of there, work with him in the offseason, and potentially try him again next year."
StLouisRams,2w59zq,estryshak,2,Wed Feb 18 04:29:17 2015 UTC,"I think both sides have valid points and yet weaknesses to their arguments too. I mean, we got a very small sample; hard to tell anything at that point. The biggest knock, I think, is that he wasn't up and down: he was up, THEN down. He didn't vary and show improvement mixed in with rookie mistakes, he just kind of dropped off the last several game.  As for why we would put in Hill, I think it was threefold: * To give Davis a breather and not burn him out on his own mistakes as he started to tank * To give our team a morale boost. Hill played better/more consistently, then the rest of the team could know they could execute and have a shot at winning without the QB having the potential to horribly tank and throw inexplicable picks to murder your chances in the 4th quarter. * To save face for Fisher. Our team salvaged some wins towards the end, gained momentum as a team heading into next season, instead of falling off at 4-12 or something like that."
StLouisRams,2w59zq,CplPJ,2,Tue Feb 17 03:06:11 2015 UTC,Definitely not. I wonder how far we could have gone if we stuck with Hill all year.
StLouisRams,2w59zq,crackalac,2,Tue Feb 17 05:47:33 2015 UTC,I liked Davis and would have preferred if he started all year.
StLouisRams,2w59zq,thebluick,8,Wed Feb 18 00:31:46 2015 UTC,"And by pure extrapolation, like 17 int. How can you only extrapolate the good and ignore the bad? Because Carr got better?"
StLouisRams,2w59zq,Davidfreeze,2,Wed Feb 18 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"The Denver game was one by our defense obviously. But if you turn a couple of our three and outs that game into we threw a pick and they get a short yardage situation, Peyton could've made us pay. You can't say a gunslinger would've done as well as a control guy in that game at all. Austin Davis isn't very good. And maybe it was the 3-4 or maybe it was the fact defenses had tape on him and once that happened he started to suck. He was getting worse, not better"
StLouisRams,2w59zq,Davidfreeze,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"He started off good, but he played really badly for a few games, and I think the Rams sincerely thought they had a shot for the playoffs. Or at least 8-8  However Shaun Hill played just as badly.  But one of the things with the NFL, is that unless you have a lot of hype coming out of college and are a high draft pick, you probably won't get much of a chance. If you do get a chance to start and don't do well at first, you probably won't ever get a second chance."
StLouisRams,2w59zq,DiscoJer,1 point,Tue Feb 17 10:43:17 2015 UTC,"He can't read/adjust to a defense post-snap, vision sketchy.  Once teams had tape on him it was painful to watch."

StLouisRams,2w45zt,BrawndoTTM,3,Mon Feb 16 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"The past few years haven't been too kind to top QB picks. Manuel, Geno, RG3. I think Winston is as much of a risk if not more than any of them. I definitely thought Manziel and Bridgewater would go way earlier last year.  It really comes down to free agency. If the Titans, Jets, or Buccaneers grab Nick Foles or decide to take a QB in the later rounds, he could easily fall to us.   However, even if he does Fisher won't take him. He's going to continue to beef up on defense and hope Bradford stays healthy."
StLouisRams,2w45zt,FaulktheBlueRedbird,1 point,Mon Feb 16 22:00:31 2015 UTC,I think that's smart of Fisher.
StLouisRams,2w45zt,helpimnaked,1 point,Tue Feb 17 00:53:09 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely not true. If Winston was available to us, we will absolutely take him. If we didn't, it would be one of the worst draft mistakes in recent Rams history."
StLouisRams,2w45zt,axle69,2,Tue Feb 17 19:17:28 2015 UTC,It will be Tackle or defense. Unless Fisher is holding his cards close to his chest on hoping for Mariota which I sincerely doubt he's not going to make a splash on any other offensive players and he does love him some defense. FS if we don't keep McLeod or OLB but my money's on Tackle.

StLouisRams,2w1lwm,anyhistoricalfigure,8,Mon Feb 16 05:16:54 2015 UTC,"10 interceptions in 8 games played with a completion percentage under 60. He was pretty inconsistent last year. Mark Sanchez was as good as him if not better.  They both had very similar TD and INT rates to Austin Davis and only slightly better TD rates than Shaun Hill while most would agree they had better offensive weapons. Yards per attempt puts Foles in between Hill and Davis, Sanchez was the best of the 4 there. Various other measures of yards per attempt also put Foles either around or slightly ahead of Hill and Davis, but always below Sanchez.  The one thing Foles did well last year was not take sacks but that might be what lead to his rather high interception total (throwing the ball away at bad times instead of taking the sack). He did have a much higher sack rate the year before. Not sure though since the only Eagles game I watched was the one against us and he didn't have to do too much that game.  Foles regressed hard last year, nowhere near the same form he showed in his 2nd year. I would not give up much for him. Mid round pick at absolute most."
StLouisRams,2w1lwm,m_fromm,1 point,Mon Feb 16 06:33:39 2015 UTC,He threw up some really ill advised throws against us this year
StLouisRams,2w1lwm,kahyote484,1 point,Mon Feb 16 18:28:43 2015 UTC,"For most QBs you need to take away their best few games and their worst few games and really judge the meat of their play.  Foles in that regard is not very good.  I'd rather have Sanchez, but I think Bradford is better than both of them.  Obviously assuming he stays healthy.  I would give Bradford one more shot.  Give him a 3 year deal with the option to trade/cut ties after 1year.  Prove yourself deal."
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,5mars,6,Sun Feb 15 14:48:01 2015 UTC,Big season for Sam if he wants a future in the nfl so no doubt we will get his very best... we just need his health as well
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,PRE_-CISION-_,0,Sun Feb 15 21:05:53 2015 UTC,Exact same thing everyone said going into last season.  That worked out well.
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,suburban_robot,10,Mon Feb 16 15:26:27 2015 UTC,"Rams are really left without options here. The time to fix this situation was before last season, when they were loaded with draft picks.  Instead they went all in on Bradford, and now they are holding a terrible hand."
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,suburban_robot,14,Sun Feb 15 18:34:20 2015 UTC,"It's completely dependent on Sam's health, which is up in the air.  Unknown hand =/= terrible hand."
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,ickypicky,-1,Sun Feb 15 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"Playing the odds, even before last season, the Rams should have been prepared with more legitimate options than the ones they brought into the season.  Playing the percentages, they did themselves a large disservice."
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,suburban_robot,2,Mon Feb 16 15:21:17 2015 UTC,"How could they have done that? I'd take our back-ups over Bortles, JF or Bridgewater and we didn't have the cap-room to shell out for a proven QB, especially with a recovering Bradford in the wings."
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,ickypicky,1 point,Tue Feb 17 01:28:22 2015 UTC,"So, if you were an NFL GM and the Rams approached you with a trade to give Austin Davis or Shaun Hill over say Bridgewater...you would accept?  I just want to make sure I'm reading this right."
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,suburban_robot,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:46:48 2015 UTC,"I'm saying I'd take them over any QB in that draft given we keep Robinson and Donald with Sam recovering.

StLouisRams,2vz1rr,ickypicky,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:50:05 2015 UTC,"Would have been in a bad situation regardless...who would we have gotten last year that would have made any difference? The only two worth anything are Carr and Bridgewater...neither of which I would take over Bradford this year. None of the free agents this year are a better choice than Bradford.   Even this year, we got what options in the draft for a QB? Basically we have to hope one of the QB this draft turns into a prospect.   Bradford is sadly our only hope right now"
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,price-iz-right,2,Sun Feb 15 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"Carr put up amazing numbers, but a lot of that was garbage time. He's good, but overrated for now at least."
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,BrawndoTTM,2,Sun Feb 15 23:57:02 2015 UTC,"Carr is great! But hindsight is 20/20.   At that time we thought Bradford would be healthy.  And I still hold, given his health/o line performance/receiver performance, that Bradford is a good QB.  I'd still take Bradford over rookies/FA given those 3 issues work out this year.     He has had plenty of time to recover this time around. Another injury and I say he's done, but a re injury to the same knee within a year is common. Hopefully he has fully recovered, it's happened in the past with other players. This is, again, a wait and see move. Bottom line we pick up a rookie in the draft and start developing this year regardless. Our o line is shit. Don't care what QB is behind the helm, they wouldn't have performed much better than Davis or Hill last year. It's by and large our biggest problem beyond the QB situation. I'd argue it's a bigger problem but that (along with everything else I say) is just my opinion. We need to draft a C and a RG this draft, maybe even a T. Our receivers are producing at a much better rate than the last time Bradford was playing. I don't have statistics, but I pay attention. Last time we saw Bradford playing our receivers couldn't catch a pass to save their lives. The season he went down I hated our receiver corps. This past year, however, I find myself excited with our receivers. They are at a different level and Bradford should be able to use his cannon of an arm more effectively.   If all of this pans out, add our monster defense, ST, and run game...we are going to be fine this year.   Also penalties...ffs penalties kill us."
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,price-iz-right,-1,Mon Feb 16 03:30:49 2015 UTC,"We thought Bradford would be healthy?  I sure as hell didn't.  And even if I did, I definitely wasn't so confident that I would have ignored QB in the draft.  This isn't hindsight, it's taking management to task for willful ignorance.  This year, I agree with you.  The Rams have no choice but to roll with Bradford again, and probably lose another season.  But the Rams fucked up huge last year in the draft by ignoring QB, and here we are.  The sad thing is that everyone on this sub this time last year agreed 100% with management, and now everyone is complaining.  No one has any foresight."
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,suburban_robot,0,Mon Feb 16 00:36:31 2015 UTC,"This year, the draft options for a QB are not good.  The time to strike was last year.  The Rams could have drafted Carr, could have drafted Bridgewater, could have drafted Jimmy G, or could have drafted any number of other developmental QBs.  Instead, they inexplicably chose to ignore the need and go all in on Bradford (and his health).  It was a terrible decision that has come back to haunt them in a big way."
StLouisRams,2vz1rr,suburban_robot,4,Mon Feb 16 15:25:47 2015 UTC,"This is the only move to make. I blame last year on the medical staff. If a such a light hit was able to tear it, he was coming back way before he was ready."

Draft is always an unsure thing but this isn't really ruling that out. Cutting Sam saves money sure, but what the hell is the plan at QB if we did cut him. Force our own hand and throw Winston/Mariota if they are available at 10 or a Petty/Hundley/Grayson from the 2nd or 3rd round behind an OL we aren't sure we can fully trust? I want options other than him, Shaun Hill, and Austin Davis, yes, but I don't see how fully moving on from Bradford at this point really helps anything going into next season.   I'd rather have the problem of being stuck with a rookie QB that we don't need because of Bradford playing well, than be stuck with the problem of having no QB because the rookie sucks and we cut Bradford."

He was playing very well in the preseason and every indication was he was going to have a breakout year. It's easy look back with hindsight and say they should have drafted a QB higher or signed someone else. But with the information available the team made the right call last season. And what would you suggest we do now? What better options are available?  Bottom line, there's nothing insane about following the most reasonable plan available.

I agree though that I think he will get cut or need to sign a new deal. Too many injuries to be paid like 9 mil for a guard/RT.

StLouisRams,2vtach,mlasn,3,Sat Feb 14 01:12:58 2015 UTC,when Schottenheimer left the jets there were similar complaints about the volume/terminology.

Bradford being back will help (obviously) if he stays healthy.
StLouisRams,2vtach,bozo7337,4,Fri Feb 13 22:22:57 2015 UTC,"I like to bash on Schotty also but how much can you really do with the personnel we had? No OL or QB, can't pass or run really."

StLouisRams,2vrp7c,Maverick814,7,Fri Feb 13 14:50:31 2015 UTC,Technically Jeff Fisher never got input in the draft until the 2007 season. Following the 2006 season then GM Floyd Reese resigned as GM of the Titans because he didn't want to give up any of his control to Fisher. So the only QB's Fisher has actually drafted would be the last 2 6th rounders Smith and Gilbert.
StLouisRams,2vrp7c,bozo7337,5,Fri Feb 13 15:07:00 2015 UTC,"So my post is even more irrelevant! Ha  I just did some basic research but I honestly know little about Fisher's time with the Titans.  Rusty Smith at least saw some playing time and has a starter for a game even! He has a career 0 TD's, 4 INTs, 234 passing yards, 29.3 QB rating."
StLouisRams,2vrp7c,PomfAndCircvmstance,2,Fri Feb 13 15:21:02 2015 UTC,Can't blame Young on Fisher. That was all on senile Bud Adams pulling a Jimmy Haslam and overruling everyone to take the guy he wanted.  Fisher isn't really a QB development guy anyways. He's a defense coach and always has been so whoever the OC and QB coach are will have way more of a role in developing the Rams QBs than he will.
StLouisRams,2vrp7c,JimboLodisC,1 point,Fri Feb 13 18:32:38 2015 UTC,Looks like it'll be at least 2018 before he drafts another QB.

StLouisRams,2vrp7c,tylerseher,1 point,Fri Feb 13 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"I always like Vince Young and still do honestly.  He still holds a winning record as a starter and a pretty impressive win % if I remember correctly. He was just not emotionally ready for the NFL. I feel bad for him, because I think he could have really been great if he had the right mind for the game.  I hate when people dog him when in reality he had all the tools and skill to be great he just mentally couldn't handle the big game.  All of this is irrelevant to anything lol, but I just always liked him and still do."
StLouisRams,2vphps,CplPJ,6,Thu Feb 12 23:45:18 2015 UTC,I noticed Corey Harkey in a couple of those plays hustling like a mad man.  Always liked that guy.  Solid #3 TE/FB

StLouisRams,2vnq7n,The_Wayward,4,Thu Feb 12 16:58:38 2015 UTC,"I mean he wasn't awful, but he closed out the season with 707 yards and 3.7 YPC. He has a history of taking a long time to come back from soft tissue injuries (especially in his legs). When he does make it back to field, it still takes him a while to get his step back if he avoids re-injury.   He got abused all those years with us. He's carried the ball over 2,700 times in his career. If he doesn't stay with the Falcons, I don't think any team is going to take him over vet min. I think he may be ready to focus on other interests like his art, instead of football as well."

StLouisRams,2vnq7n,LLv2,5,Thu Feb 12 17:39:42 2015 UTC,Hear hear.  We need a back that can reliably bang it in from 2 yards out and prevent us from using Brian Schottenheimer type plays.  Plus he's an okay receiver so he doesn't give the play away completely when he comes in.  Plus he's a mofo as a blocker.  And he hardly ever fumbles.
StLouisRams,2vnq7n,MengTheBarbarian,16,Thu Feb 12 17:44:15 2015 UTC,Breaks my heart that he's never had a winning season.

So good for them.    It doesn't change the truth of my statement that consistent talks of owners moving their teams to new cities and leaving existing fanbases behind is damaging to the NFL's brand.
StLouisRams,2vhgw4,BilllyMayes,5,Wed Feb 11 01:24:12 2015 UTC,"Quiet off the field but deadly on it, just like a fart.   Hahaha, this might be my favorite description of Aaron Donald I have ever seen.  And you're right about his speed off the ball -- it's just mind blowing sometimes, it seems superhuman.    This was a great installment in your series and a very welcome respite from the competing, ""they're leaving!""/""they're staying!"" posts that have clogged up this sub lately.  I hope you continue these to include all the backups and even the coaching staff -- it might be even more interesting reading about the lesser-known guys."

StLouisRams,2vhgw4,librarianC,2,Wed Feb 11 07:10:09 2015 UTC,I wouldnt say he is HUGE. He is a below-average size DT with the strength of a fucking lion.

StLouisRams,2vfq5s,dr_genius,15,Tue Feb 10 17:35:17 2015 UTC,To preface I am a STL fan and I agree on this being a split sub. There are two signs to this coin though and it's starting to draw out the ire of the LA group of fans. We in our hope for them to stay have been vote brigading the LA fans in force lately. Even relatively innocent posts have been down voted. I'm all for the ones that are antagonistic to be down voted and believe me there have been a few but this will continue unless we buck up and let them have a little joy in this as well so long as they don't try and take away from our hope of them staying.
StLouisRams,2vfq5s,axle69,12,Tue Feb 10 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"One thing that does get annoying, and again I'm not in LA and never have been. But I have been a fan since they've been in LA. The idea that this sub is solely the property of Rams fans in St Louis only fuels the divide. This is the Rams sub. It's titled the St Louis Rams because that is the city they currently play in. If they move the sub for the Rams linked in /r/NFL will likely be titled simply /r/Rams or it'll be /r/LARams. Until this happens this is the most popular Rams sub and it's where all Rams fans come to talk."
StLouisRams,2vfq5s,bozo7337,23,Tue Feb 10 19:06:44 2015 UTC,"Would it be a bad situation to ban talking about relocation and stadium issues on this sub?   All of us are invested in it enough, I think we can get that information on our own without using the sub as a repository for that as well. I'd like to get back to debating draft choices, talking about the team's future (in the NFL not in STL), and showing general support for our players and coaches.   Shout out to /u/BilllyMayes I've been really enjoying the series you've been doing. It's the kind of analysis I really dig seeing in here."
StLouisRams,2vfq5s,The_Wayward,13,Tue Feb 10 19:24:23 2015 UTC,"Until there's actual news, I think that banning such discussion is a worthy idea."
StLouisRams,2vfq5s,Fungo,8,Tue Feb 10 20:37:51 2015 UTC,"Everything is speculation and non-news regarding it. Until the NFL or Kroenke officially announce it, the discussion shouldn't be going on around here. Leave the clickbait news for the /r/NFL circlejerk about relocating."
StLouisRams,2vfq5s,Troy_Davis,5,Tue Feb 10 20:58:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'd love it if this was a stadium-talk free zone until the official announcement. It would end the divisiveness in the sub and allow us to go back to discussing the reason we are here in the first place.
StLouisRams,2vfq5s,The_Wayward,6,Tue Feb 10 21:12:21 2015 UTC,I'd go as far to say that a weekly stadium talk thread would be fine. Those who don't wish to participate can avoid it.

For example, the announcement that STL is willing to do utility relocations is fairly important and this is the only place I will be seeing that kind of news.  Maybe we could enforce some kind of ""if you are being a dick about STL vs. LA or trying to insight arguments about the situation, you will be banned.""  Edit: Or maybe a ban on speculation articles, and only allow articles that have confirmed facts in them like the article on the press conference that came out today."

It's nice that this sub can usually be a catch-all for all things Rams, but this is a huge problem right now.   Maybe we could ask the mods to drop a link in the sidebar to Nick Wagoner's twitter? He does a great job at posting all the information that comes out, and that way it would be accessible from the sub but not in everyone's face."

For example, the announcement that STL is willing to do utility relocations is fairly important    This is a terrible idea.  Banning any talk about relocation to LA, but allowing talk about progress in keeping the team in St. Louis?  You're just asking for this to become a pro-StL circlejerk and while you might enjoy only reading one side of this story many of us want to read both sides of this story that is so important to the team we love.  The same thing was called for in that awful St. Louis Post-Dispatch Rams Talk Forum but this isn't the Post-Dispatch.  It's also not /r/conservative or /r/Pyongyang where only one opinion is allowed and anyone who doesn't toe the line is banned.   And banning people who are ""being dicks""?  By whose definition?  Yours?  I honestly think that this is nothing but an effort to censor people whose opinions differ from your own.  Reddit already has a downvote system so use it if you feel that upset, we don't need anything more draconian to protect you or anyone else from reading news, opinions, or comments that make you uncomfortable."

I travel to see them, have been through years of losing, but I never give up. They're my team and I only have one. I don't believe in switching teams unless yours goes the way of the Dodo. Whenever I meet other Rams fans were just happy there's more of us. I love the Dodgers and Kings subs but this one is pretty crappy. There are some great posts but as of late all you guys do is bicker. Us LA based fans stuck with them when they left us and if you guys can't wrap your heads around the idea of doing the same then get another team. A lot to f fans in LA did when our boys left. Good riddance o bad rubbish. Posting articles about stadium news is fine because we'd all like to know whether they're closer to staying or going but arguing about who's a bigger fan or whatever is stupid."

StLouisRams,2vfq5s,Ojami,6,Mon Feb 16 22:44:36 2015 UTC,"Well said.

I never saw a Rams game in LA while they played there. I've been to St Louis a few times. I've been to Rams games in SF countless times. There are trolls on both sides of the vitriol. There are people from LA who insist the team belongs to them. There are people from St Louis who think this sub belongs to them and screw you if you even mention anything about LA. It's really a sad state of affairs that people can't acknowledge this and just root for the Rams.
StLouisRams,2vfq5s,Popolar,2,Tue Feb 10 18:05:21 2015 UTC,"I completely get what you're saying man, but let me offer a little insight on why us STL folk don't take liking to Mr. Kronke.   Kronke has been a ghost in the media. LA relocation rumors have been looming over our heads for a few years now, and with the stadium lease coming to an end, Kronke comes out of his absence just to say that he wants to build a stadium in Inglewood. After years of this guy not saying anything to the STL fans, the one and only thing the guy says is that he wants out.   I'm not saying that I don't understand his reasoning. A relocation to LA makes just about as much sense as keeping the team in St. Louis, and I actually mean that (I am not trying to argue here). Just the fact that Kronke has not had any presence whatsoever with the STL fans. We feel as if we were taken advantage of.   And I'm also not saying that LA fans were not taken advantage of by GF. They were absolutely. But people trying to justify Kronke's antics to the people of STL by saying that GF did something similar to the people of LA is just plain wrong. It's a fallacy.  Well, theres my two cents."

StLouisRams,2vh2kw,PectoralisMajor,12,Tue Feb 10 23:31:25 2015 UTC,I think the team really needs to rebuilt the O line. I wouldn't be against taking OL in both the first and second round depending on what is on the board. I'd like them to look into Tomlinson or Kouandjio in the second. Not quite sure about who in the first since I don't really want to use a #10 on a LG/RT.
StLouisRams,2vh2kw,mlasn,8,Wed Feb 11 00:06:20 2015 UTC,"Cut Long, Wells, Langford and restructure Bradford (no suprises there)  While I would love to sign Iupati or Dez Bryant (a guy can dream right) I don't think that there are any free agents that truly fill our needs at a price tag that we can afford. I see potentially quite a few short-term prove it deals for the 2nd tier of free agents rather than targetting the big names. I really hope to see a QB, even if it is just a camp body - I'm thinking Hoyer, McCown or Mallett.  In terms of returning free agent signings, I think that the order of priority is as follows:  Kenny Britt - he was verging on a true number 1 receiver towards the second half of the season, and he is always a threat for the deep ball whilst also freeing up space underneath. Not to mention that I attribute at least 20% of Quick's emergence to Britt's tutelage.  Lance Kendricks - a real solid player, nothing he does will wow you but he's above average both in the line as a blocker as well as a reciever. I think that his value to the team is often overlooked.  Joe Barksdale - Probably the second best o-line player that we have, although this says more about the state of our O-line (more on this later). More than serviceable for the next 5 years, but somehow I don't think he'll ever become truely great. I worry that he may have a lot of interest from other teams, so lets not break the bank for him.  Shaun Hill - Played much better than expected in relief of Sam last season. Pretty much always kept us competitive and already knows the system and has chemistry with the receivers.  Rodney McLeod - Despite poor showings in the previous couple of seasons he has really picked up his game this season. And while everybody always talks about taking him out of his starting role, I think that he is the most natural FS on the team (the potential exception being Joyner, but he seems destined as corner for now)  Cory Harkey - another significant contributer for the team that doesn't get enough love. If we lose him, we're going to need at least 2 or 3 new players to fill all his roles.  Tim Barnes - for depth. Given the current status of our o-line, I'm not comfortable letting a guy with familiarity and experiece go. Plus I think he'll be reasonably priced.  Everybody else should receive league minimum contracts or be let go.  In terms of our draft, a lot of mocks have us looking towards OLB, CB and WR, but I honestly do not think these positions are a real issue at all. What we do absolutely need is QB and O-line. Ideally I would want a QB in the 2nd round (I don't think that any first round talent will be availabe by pick number 10) and I would be more than happy to spend LITERALLY every other pick on o-line. It is by far our biggest weakness and even then we are losing savvy and experience from this position group. Not to mention that we would need to replace the losses of Wells, Person and Joseph.  So there you have it: QB, O-line and Britt"
StLouisRams,2vh2kw,opaquewindow,1 point,Wed Feb 11 00:11:20 2015 UTC,"The offensive line is something that needs to be fixed, but there's one key factor in how much fixing it'll need. Wells will obviously be cut. Which leaves a hole at C and RG. Do the Rams have faith in Barksdale that they will re-sign him? Barksdale didn't have the greatest year at RT but that comes with playing alongside Davin Joseph, one of the worst guards in the game. What also comes into question is does the front office have any faith in one of Barnes or Jones? If they go into next season choosing to start one of them, then that's taken care of.  Pretty much what it comes down to is the decisions made will determine if we need to rebuild the whole right side of our line and center, or just a RG (unless they also decide they want to try Barksdale at RG, which makes RT our need). Now, if a RG/RT is our only need that changes our draft strategy by a lot in my opinion. At the #10 spot, that's usually where you see LT's being taken. But if there is a lineman the Rams covet at that spot and feel will be worth it...then by all means they go for it.  But this then brings up the question mark of Jake Long. Do we outright cut him? Or could we potentially move him inside and allow Robinson to develop? It's possible he may not want to move inside or he just wouldn't be good as a guard. Then again that also all depends on his recovery. There are a LOT of questions regarding our offensive line. And we probably won't get many answers anytime soon.  We're also going with the assumption that next season, our starting HB will be Tre Mason and Brian Quick will be healthy and Britt will be alongside him. Which gives us a quartet of Quick, Britt, Bailey, and Austin. (In my eyes, Givens is all but done which is sad. There is talent there but I just don't see it happening here) It's not bad, but will Quick be 100%? Can Britt continue to stay healthy? Will Austin be utilized properly? Which brings up the possibility of Dorial Green-Beckham at the #10 spot as well. Yes, that's another draft pick spent on a wide receiver but we have to stop going after the fringe-type receivers. Quick is the only one with a large enough frame to pan out as a potential #1 and he's only just scratching the surface.   Now. As far as QB goes. Yes. We need one. But you can forget Mariota and Winston. They won't fall that far and I don't think we make the jump. Will Bradford restructure his deal? I imagine he will. But is it smart to go into the season with him as a starter? I don't know. I want him to succeed but who knows if that will actually happen. So we're looking at the second round where Brett Hundley is probably our only legitimate option. There are a bunch of other QBs we can look at but do they project as NFL QBs? Or, if Nick Foles is available for trade, do we swap our first round pick for him? I'm not a fan of that idea but trying to keep all options open.  And this isn't even getting into the defense. We have to cut Langford. That much is evident. With Brockers and Donald, it makes no sense to have Langford around. Sure, he's a vet and a good backup but he's not being paid backup money. At the linebacker position, the only real question mark is Dunbar. Laurinaitis has been solid. Ogletree has his ups and downs but has the potential to be a star. Cornerback I think we're in the clear with a trio of Jenkins, Gaines, and Johnson. But getting a veteran CB presence could be good for the development of the young guys we have. I also say getting a veteran safety could be good.   And I'm done for now."
StLouisRams,2vh2kw,JKaye57,-1,Thu Feb 12 16:13:58 2015 UTC,Fisher is a career 8-8 coach. That's all you'll get out of any roster with him in charge.   Edit: I forgot the other off limit topic in /r/stlouisrams. Thou shalt not disparage the 'stache.
StLouisRams,2vh2kw,eight26,9,Tue Feb 10 23:41:32 2015 UTC,Don't know who down voted you but Fisher has done a good job of turning the team around. I have the same concern you do about him not being able to take them to the next level but I think he needs another 2 years before I completely agree.
StLouisRams,2vh2kw,mlasn,6,Wed Feb 11 00:00:11 2015 UTC,"Under Fisher, the Rams have had their best three-year stretch since 2003-2005.  Wow, that's not saying much."
StLouisRams,2vh2kw,LLv2,3,Wed Feb 11 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in the sense that, he came in rebuilding the team. Once he had a potential playoff team, our starting qb goes down. Whether or not, Bradford works out, I still think our defense is good enough, that it can carry us with our run game to the playoffs (or a winning season :(  )"
StLouisRams,2vh2kw,pmm2428,3,Wed Feb 11 00:36:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I think if we can get a better OL then our run game with Mason/Austin should be pretty good and enough to open up the pass game if we have get mediocre QB play."

His first year was a very nice improvement, yes. Year 2 saw one more loss. Year 3 saw one more loss again.  Every team has injuries. So I'm not giving him a pass there.  The team is moving in the wrong direction."
StLouisRams,2vh2kw,eight26,3,Wed Feb 11 01:31:51 2015 UTC,"I liked the hire at the time cause the plain truth was we just weren't going to land anyone better.  But the modern game has passed Fisher by, that should be clear to anyone.  He has had about four excellent years in his career, none since 2008 when he caught lightning in a bottle with Chris Johnson. His other good seasons were all well before that with Eddie George and Steve McNair. Other than that he's been average to really awful.  He just seems too stubborn to adapt to the modern passing game.  Rams fans just like him because he's not Scott Linehan or Steve Spagnuolo."

This is my fear too, which is why I was hoping for a big-name, established OC who could take the reins and run the offense without Fisher's input.  We don't know what we'll get with either Cignetti or Boras but if the plan is to continue Schotty's system then I don't have much confidence that we'll see much of an improvement with either of them."
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,SoulardSTL,13,Tue Feb 10 18:27:08 2015 UTC,Q: Why is this so important?   A: Roger Goodell “Extremely Pleased” With Latest St. Louis Developments
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,eight26,4,Tue Feb 10 18:28:13 2015 UTC,Does the stadium development team have any budget or does this bill get rolled into the overall stadium plan?
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,eight26,2,Tue Feb 10 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"From the article...    (T)he new stadium would be funded by public financing, including by extending the current bonds on the Edward Jones Dome, which would provide between $300 million and $350 million; Brownfield tax credits of between $25 million and $30 million; Missouri Development Finance Board tax credits of between $15 million and $20 million; and private seat license proceeds, which could account for up to $130 million. It would also include at least $400 million in private investment from the NFL and an NFL team owner.   Regarding State funding of bonds, an economic assessment is currently being conducted by the State of Missouri regarding the economic impact of the Saint Louis Rams (and/or any NFL team). This economic impact report shall determine the amount of monies the team generates, directly and indirectly, for the City & State. From here, it will be determinable if it is in the economic best interests of Missouri to support extension of the existing municipal bonds so as to facilitate construction of the New Riverfront Stadium and thereby retain the existing business & its income streams. This process is standard for such situations and is being conducted to ensure that the State properly allocates monies towards profitable ventures.   It must be noted here as well that, during the press conference this morning, Gov. Nixon reiterated that the State garnered $10MM in this past year directly from income taxes of both the Rams' players and all visiting teams' players. Meanwhile, the State of Missouri's contribution to the existing municipal bonds is $12MM/year. Going forward, this commission should look to whether or not the Rams produce additional taxable revenues for the State in excess of $2MM/year (easy to do) in order to assess whether or not extension of the current municipal bonds is economically viable."
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,The_Wayward,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:18:43 2015 UTC,"I saw that in the article. Who pays for the rail and utility move? Does that fall under the stadium plan, the development team's project budget, or something else?"
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,LLv2,2,Tue Feb 10 19:43:32 2015 UTC,My understanding is that it was rolled into the initial stadium proposal as a contingency. That would mean that it was included in what Peacock and Blitz proposed to the governor in January and would be funded along with the stadium itself.
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,LLv2,2,Tue Feb 10 19:47:29 2015 UTC,"This was my interpretation as well, that these actions are generally part of the $900MM total development costs, the allocation of which has not been individually itemized to the development's costs. While these could be self-funded by Ameren and the TRRA themselves, we should just assume now that they're part of the total development package. Likely, these costs had already been figured into the full development's costs.   Also, from the press conference, the actual relocation of the rail lines and electrical towers will occur if and only if the New Riverfront Stadium is actually built, otherwise everything stays where they are. No shovels just yet, but they're at the ready..."

StLouisRams,2vfxeg,Magnemmike,7,Wed Feb 11 03:10:59 2015 UTC,"For the record, Stan hasn't talked to the press since before assuming full ownership of the team, and what he said was he's in STL for the long term, that he didn't want to take the Rams out of STL, and that we can and should take him at his word.   Since then: absolutely nothing.   What a dick.   I'd honestly be surprised if he said as much as you think he would, because publicly, he's a mute."
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,eight26,3,Wed Feb 11 03:24:34 2015 UTC,He's let his actions do his talking.  But he hasn't talked to anyone from the city or the state in private.  That's how much of a dick he is.

How does this proposal get together if Stan doesn't spend 400 million on this project? 209 million of stans dough, plus the NFL loan for the other 200 million Stan pays back.

StLouisRams,2vfxeg,eight26,5,Wed Feb 11 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"Team contribution has been essential to this proposal the whole time: $200MM from the Rams, plus matching G-4 loan of up to $200MM, with the rest covered by the fans, the City, the County, and the State.   The idea of Missouri paying for the whole thing has never been part of the equation; we're just not going to gift a private business with a billion dollar stadium because he's playing hard-to-get and giving the ""silent treatment"". Look where that's gotten us beforehand.   And that's why the Stadium Commission is talking straight to the NFL. We're preparing what's necessary, and in line with League rules, for what must be available for a team (a viable long-term facility) to retain a franchise. If we play by the NFL's rules, then we hope the NFL follows by their own rules and prevents a team from relocating when their needs are being met. STL is seeking what's expected of us, and we're following through with everything except the total tab for the new Riverfront Stadium.   What will happen if Kroenke goes ""Baltimore Colts""? I'm quite curious myself. But if we do our part, STL should be able to keep our team."
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,D9-EM,-1,Wed Feb 11 03:19:00 2015 UTC,"I get everything St. Louis is doing, and it all just seem hopeful.   In the end, the owners control the nfl, not goodell. He will do what the owners want and vote on. It is the votes from the owners that can slow Stan.  But even then may not stop.  Forgetting all that,  the money needed from Stan and that G4 money... Stan was in a position before for the first proposal at EJD and he wasn't paying anything.  What will make Stan break out a checkbook now?  Edit: mobile typing"
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,Magnemmike,4,Wed Feb 11 04:46:40 2015 UTC,"It would take a firm ruling by the NFL, via its owners, that they will not approve of him taking the team out of a viable city with a proven fan base, and then continuing on with business as usual. Say the NFL tells him no, that he can't move to LA if a solution exists in STL; at that time, he can choose to either fund 20% of the new riverfront stadium or keep paying $25K/year to play at the EJD.   Kroenke's said he will play by the NFL's rules. If you take him at his word (and I don't necessarily recommend that you do), then in the end he will do what the other NFL owners vote to allow him to do. And if he goes rogue, then total costs to move the team to LA would be around $3BB when taking into account construction, leasing, the move itself, relocation fees, and punitive fines for going rogue. That's 50-60% of his personal net worth, liquid and illiquid.   Quite simply, if he's apparently ready to drop $3BB to move the team to LA, then he sure as fuck can pony up $200MM in STL."
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,daveedo_bandito,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"If he spends $200MM on a loan for a stadium in the Lou, that's a liability, in accounting terms.  If he spends $2BB on a stadium in the Hood, that's an asset on the books.  It's not just money out in both instances.  One has a negative affect on the balance sheet.  The other is positive.  Not only that, but his current asset, the franchise itself, will triple in value.  Regardless of where your geographical allegiances lie (his, yours, or mine), moving to LA is a much better business decision."
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,Magnemmike,2,Wed Feb 11 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"This is the first time I've seen the word ""loan"" used aside from the NFL's G-4...  Stan Kroenke would rightfully claim equity ownership (not a lease, loan, or donation) to the new STL stadium if he contributes 20-25% of the monies to the new facility. No one has said that monies ownership puts into the stadium would be anything other than equity. I have not heard of Kroenke loaning any monies anywhere around here.   Far as I've seen, any monies to be paid by Stan Kroenke, Kroenke Sports Enterprises, and/or the Rams Organization (KSE/Rams) into the new STL stadium would be towards equity, not a donation. While the stadium itself would be owned primarily by the governments that pay into it, KSE/Rams would retain their equity position in line with their allocated monies. Further, that would open up revenue streams to KSE/Rams for all uses of the stadium, including: facility naming rights, NFL use (ticket sales, concessions & retail, etc.), MLS use (a percentage of ticket sales, concessions & retail, etc. plus a long-term lease by the MLS franchisee), NCAA sporting events, non-sports events like concerts, and event parking. It very well may be the allocation of these revenue streams that concludes the negotiations towards the new STL stadium being built.   And if he increases his allocation into the new STL Stadium (as unlikely as that may be), then his equity position would change accordingly.   So far, there have been no public mentions the details of these arrangements, other than the stadium would be, in the absence of KSE/Rams investment, fully a public asset. It is only reasonable to assume that, with private investments made, that investment would be respected as equity.  This would not preclude him from his Inglewood project, which would provide him with: revenue streams for a long-term lease of the facility by whatever franchise moves there; a percentage of ticket sales revenues, including luxury boxes & PSLs, as lessor; concession & retail sales; naming rights; and parking, as well as all ancillary developments involved with the total development.   Truly, what STL is presenting Stan Kroenke is the opportunity to have an equity position in two NFL stadiums, plus ancillary revenue streams, in two markets, with solid ROI in both. That’s why I think it remains very likely that Inglewood will be host to a team other than the Rams, from which Stan Kroenke would still profit.   Addendum: Here's where negotiations could go between KSE & STL/MO - revenue allocations after the NFL's G-4 contribution is taken into consideration. The NFL would not look to recognize any revenue streams from non-football business at the stadium, like concessions or parking. I bet that this'll all come down to how revenue streams are recognized.   Say KSE/Rams contributes 20% of the stadium's costs. By that investment, it serves as the impetus for an additional 20% allocation from the NFL's G-4 forgivable loan program. Here, KSE/Rams will contest that they deserve a higher revenue stream beyond their 20% contribution to facilities costs because they were the impetus to the G-4 monies that would not exist otherwise, say up to 40%, while STL/MO retains their revenues based on their fixed investment allocations. When these negotiations settle, parties will have an agreement, and the new STL stadium will be built."
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,daveedo_bandito,2,Wed Feb 11 20:17:14 2015 UTC,"Got it.  A straight $200MM from Uncle Rico, $250 in G4 from the NFL (payable by the city/county/state?), and the rest from extending current bonds.   Somehow, I thought the St Louis developers wanted $200 from him AND for him to pay the G4 loan."
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,Dave_the_lighting_gu,2,Wed Feb 11 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"Nah, G-4 is a ""forgivable"" loan program that basically acts as a subsidy by the NFL to teams/cities building new facilities. This comes from the shares revenues garnered from TV revenues and the like. Under G-4, the League itself will match up to $200MM with the owner's equity; recent recipients include both Minneapolis and Atlanta."
StLouisRams,2vfxeg,D9-EM,2,Wed Feb 11 21:55:33 2015 UTC,Wow. Sweetheart of a deal.
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,fingrblastr99,11,Tue Feb 10 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"My thoughts? I'll still take an injury prone Bradford over this rookie and free agent class. Signing names like Hoyer, Henne, and Sanchez, as Schein suggests, makes me cringe. I think the Rams should definitely restructure his contract to give him one more crack at it with a more realistic paycheck. If he can't cut it this year, and there's a better option for the next season, then by all means. Definitely bring in some competition this year for him and see what comes from it, but as far as I can see, there isn't an obviously better option out there."
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,Kicker0fE1ves,3,Tue Feb 10 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"Here's a reminder of the play that Sam tore his ACL on last preseason.       Now, I ask this with all sincerity, how can we possibly trust him to be our starting quarterback? He was barely touched on that play, had spent the better part of a year rehabbing, and still blew out his knew one of the first times he saw action. How can we believe he's going to be better after another surgery?       I too find those other choices uninspiring. But any QB is a better choice than a QB who's on the sideline in street clothes."
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,Kicker0fE1ves,8,Wed Feb 11 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily how hard someone hits you, but how the injured part moves. If it moves poorly AND gets hit hard, then it's extra bad, but some of the worst injuries for any player are non contact or little contact that looks like a love tap on film. Not saying he isn't injury prone, as he clearly is, but the power of a hit isn't the only factor."
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,AsaKurai,5,Wed Feb 11 01:18:31 2015 UTC,"Still, it seemed a pretty routine play, did it not? And if memory serves, it was the third offensive series he quarterbacked in the preseason. He might just as well have blown out his knee running out of the tunnel in the first game.       I know that franchise QBs don't grow on trees, but to me this is just all the more reason to put forth as much effort as possible to trying to find someone. Saying we don't need to find a QB because we have Sam, I fear, will just end with us doing this all over again next year."
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,DeniseDeNephew,2,Wed Feb 11 01:33:25 2015 UTC,"It definitely did seem a little too easy to tear, but I could easily see him getting absolutely ROCKED by Watt and getting back up uninjured.  Oh, I absolutely agree we need to get someone with legitimate skill in case of emergency, but I don't see any good options. I still haven't got into as much film as I would like, but both Mariota and Winston fail to impress me, even if you take away Winston's off the field stuff. The best FA QB might be Locker, and he's even more injury prone than Sam, and has less upside."
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,TacoxOFxBell,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:33:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. Even after every injury, at this point the team is so invested in him that we should ride him until he dies. If he was bad it would be a different story, but I believe he has talent still."
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,opaquewindow,1 point,Tue Feb 10 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, this is not the year to move on from Bradford.  There were opportunities in the past and there will be in the future but this year, no.    I was glad to see the Rams make a public statement that they want him to restructure his contract just to put a little pressure on him and his agent.  They let him know that they're not happy with their ROI but they did it in a way that was not insulting.  Considering that Sam answered every ""will you consider a pay cut?"" question in the last few months with noncommittal answers like, ""I haven't given any thought to that"" or ""that's what I have an agent for"" he needed to feel some heat.  Cutting him would probably be cutting off your nose to spite your face and Sam knows that but at least they sent him a message that they are not enamored with him."
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,sweeps28,3,Tue Feb 10 21:31:24 2015 UTC,"I agree that they need to bring Bradford back at a lot smaller price tag. I also think that Sam isn't the QB of the future. In my all honest opinion they need to use their 2nd round pick on a QB. Garrett Grayson fits the bill for the offense that the Rams want to run and he has the skills and size to be a starter in the NFL, but not right out of the gate."
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,JimboLodisC,2,Tue Feb 10 21:48:45 2015 UTC,"I say come back player of the year. There simply is no viable alternative to take his place as of right now - without either mortgaging a ton of picks for either Mariota or Winston, both of which have question marks anyway or getting a vet who simply isn't as good as Bradford.  I reckon (hope) that the coaches have seen enough to keep him even after 2 ACLs and that Bradford will restructure. If he is starting QB at the start of next season, he has never played with as good a Defence or WR duo (assuming we resign Britt) in his career. Then its only a matter of time for him to show us why he was a 1st overall pick - my guess 30TD-10INTs"
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,Ihateunerds,1 point,Tue Feb 10 23:32:47 2015 UTC,"He definitely needs to take a pay cut so we can go out and get players or re-sign some. I really want Bradford to succeed. I want him to stay a Ram even though he hasn't really done much for the franchise. For some stupid reason, I'm still holding onto hope he can take us to the next level. Why I still have hope after all of his injuries...I have no fucking idea haha"
StLouisRams,2vg9mc,TurtlesAndTrees,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:18:06 2015 UTC,"Trade while he has interest from other teams. It's not about how high your draft pick is, it's about getting more of them and increasing your chances of getting a winner.  I know it's not a popular opinion, but the only way to prove me wrong is for Bradford to have a full healthy season and the team to finish above .500. I wouldn't count on that happening, and a year from now he'll probably be worth even less leading up to the next draft class."

Honestly, outside of Spanos, Davis, or Khan (all of whom have their pro-STL biases public), I don't know if STL could have hand-picked a better committee to discuss potential relocation. Rooney & Mara (and their Dragon Tattoo granddaughter) are traditionalists who want the NFL to operate by its rules. McNair has scars from past LA dealings. Kraft could just as easily be in STL today if Orthwein had relocated the team to the Gateway City. Hunt is the only other owner in Missouri. And Richardson has to know that, if anything goes wrong for STL with the Rams, then we could just as easily bring the Panthers to town, especially because his team almost was STL's franchise in the earlier 90s (before Stan Kroenke's inability to speak to the press blew STL's chances at grabbing their franchise)."

He was a really good college QB and had 2 successful years post surgery taking OU to 2 National titles.

If they have cleared that hurdle, that's some pretty significant progress! All in all, good news for the future of football in St. Louis!"
StLouisRams,2ve2hl,daveedo_bandito,2,Tue Feb 10 06:00:34 2015 UTC,"I have a question for the St. Louis fans.  I am not a fan who lives in or has lived in St. Louis. But I wanted to hear from you all about the stadium stuff. Not looking to start any arguments or debates, I just want to know what you all honestly thought. My question is this: with the Rams' owner showing little to no interest in keeping the team where they are now, is the stadium proposal about keeping the Rams or just keeping the NFL? Once again, not trying to argue.  Just want to see your perspective of it."
StLouisRams,2ve2hl,PectoralisMajor,6,Tue Feb 10 16:02:49 2015 UTC,"I think most fans in STL would love to keep the Rams here, if only to stick it to Kroenke.  But also because the true fans have come to love them.  From the ultimate highs in the Superbowl, to the worst 5 season record in NFL history.  It's finally a team on the rise again, after a decade of deplorable football.    With all of that said, most fans realize they have one foot out the door and if STL wants to remain an NFL city we will likely have to steal a team from another city.  Can anyone say St. Louis Raiders?"
StLouisRams,2ve2hl,Dave_the_lighting_gu,6,Tue Feb 10 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"STL's Wish List: 1. Keep our STL Rams, and Kroenke is no longer the team's owner. Maybe the NFL chooses to create an LA expansion team, and Kroenke simultaneously buys that expansion franchise while putting the STL Rams up for sale to an ownership group conditional that they keep the Rams in STL. That team plays in the NFC West, and STL beats them every year. 2. Keep our STL Rams, Kroenke remains owner, and whether happy or not, Stan stays ""silent"". 3. The branding ""Rams"" moves to a new expansion team in LA, and STL is allowed to keep our team, players, coaches, etc., who will play under a different team branding. We keep who we've cheered for all these years. 4. Kroenke moves the team to Inglewood, STL awarded a new franchise through expansion. 5. Kroenke moves the team to Inglewood, STL welcomes an existing, relocated team to STL.     Addendum: With the new stadium, STL gets the 24th MLS franchise."
StLouisRams,2ve2hl,SoulardSTL,4,Tue Feb 10 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think it's a mix of both. I, and the city, wants to keep the Rams because they are established in the region. They may suck, but they have been St. Louis crappy team for 20 years. While the attendance isn't the best, nor is the fan support compared to the Cardinals down the street, but it's our team. It's our crappy dome. A lot of fans still come out, and a lot of fans have sat through so much misery of late.   With this stadium this is the end game to keep them there for another 20-30 years, or at worst show to the NFL and MLS we are serious. I added in the MLS too because the stadium would be used for it.   My biggest hope is the NFL expands to LA, has Stan sell the rams to not a dbag owner, and then go from there."
StLouisRams,2ve2hl,panderson1988,6,Tue Feb 10 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"As a guy who grew up in St. Louis and got the Rams when I was in 2nd grade, it is my position that Silent Stan is simply leveraging his position to get the ball rolling on getting a new stadium in St. Louis.  He knows nothing would have happened had he not gone through this process.  The city could just call his bluff and keep procrastinating the inevitable."
StLouisRams,2ve2hl,NinjaChemist,2,Tue Feb 10 16:14:40 2015 UTC,"Seems to me due to the repeated use of ""NFL"" and not the ""Rams"" it's more about having any team at all in St. Louis."

I wish teams would no longer move because both LA and STL has experience lost, then we can throw in Cleveland and Baltimore too.   I'm hopeful the Rams will stay in STL, sorry LA, but the city can't stand seeing another greedy owner bailing again. It would kill any chance of football coming back, or people wanting it when you've been betrayed twice. Second, STL has had a generation of fans growing up with the Rams, aka me since I'm in my mid 20s. The heartbreak to the region will hurt, same with LA. I feel like we don't need anymore heartbreak. Second, we have plenty of fans in LA who haven't witnessed football. Why not add an expansion there and start a new fanbase since it's currently split up between the Raiders, Rams, and Chargers from my recollection.   Anyway, I'm staying somewhat hopeful, but entirely optimistic since Stan, and the Lauries, are shrewd and out of touch businessmen."
StLouisRams,2vcoit,panderson1988,0,Tue Feb 10 12:34:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, but the NFL is not going to expand anytime soon. The system is perfect as is and adding more teams completely changes the system."

StLouisRams,2vcoit,jthm2004,13,Thu Feb 12 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"At what point did this writer say that LA fans didn't get screwed...  The point of the article is that STL has a history of poorly performing football teams even though it has proven to be a profitable market for football.  Honestly, you're taking this situation way too personally.  Also, as a season ticket holder through the last 7 years which has included the worst 5 years of football ever played, I completely understand the whole ""Shit-on-the-rams fest.""  I would've been a season ticket holder for longer if it weren't for how hard it was to get a PSL until the rams woes began.  Anyways there's a reason that the Rams are un-affectionately referred to as the ""same old sorry ass rams"" in STL and that's what the article is pointing out.  What you're really seeing is a city that wants to support a football team but always seems to get a laughable product.  In what way is that the people who live in the cities fault?  We don't get to chose the owner and we just now have had the first coach that had a tenure of over 2 years since Mad Mike...  Don't get me wrong, the coaching turnstile is a huge reason for the rams historic woes as well as Kronke blocking Shad Khans purchase of the team (yes, we too got screwed by the Frontiere's by selling him the right of first refusal).  Also, the rams have consistently been at the top of salary cap expenditure for much of the last decade.  Talk about mismanagement...  At this point, I'm so disenfranchised with the team that I don't care if the rams stay or go, I just don't want the NFL to go.  I love being a season ticket holder, I love the NFL, and I love that I have a place to spend my Sundays (and the rare Thursday or Monday night game - we actually got one of each this year!).  Hell, if the NFL would state that STL will get a Franchise if the rams move, I'll easily suffer a few seasons without football just to know that I'll get it back.  Also, in regards to the ""50 year history, heritage, and fan base"" statement, I honestly think that those are minute and possibly even laughable points for Kronke in the big picture but whatever makes you feel better bud...  What it boils down to is that he could possibly DOUBLE the value of the franchise while also owning the newest and best stadium in an area of roughly 16.3 million people.  He could easily book 2-3 times the amount of events that he could in STL while also owning all the parking which is pure profit in the scale we're talking about.  Why else would he go so far as to state he is going to build a BILLION DOLLAR PLUS stadium without tax payer assistance which is completely unheard of in today's NFL?  It's in no way, shape or form because he believes the Rams shouldn't be in STL because they used to be in LA which would be the worlds greatest act of charity as you chose to position it as.  It's all about the almighty dollar.  As far as whats best for the NFL, I do not believe that just one team in LA is in the NFL's best interest.  The city should easily be able to support two teams which is in fact why people bemoan LA as an NFL city - it's not just because they lost the rams but both the Rams AND Raiders at the same time.  Again, I do not blame the people but the politicians the people voted in during that time; Well, that and the complete lack of will for public funding from the state which consistently puts their professional teams in binds but I digress...  By letting only one team move back to LA, especially one that does still have a fan base there, any future teams or new franchises in that city would be miles behind and be far less profitable at least through the first decade or so.  I truly believe that for the NFL to reap the most profit from LA, two teams is their ideal situation and two fresh franchises would give no benefit to either of the teams outside of maybe stadium location should there be two stadiums built.  I also believe that Kronke knows this and he wants to make as much money as possible which is why you're seeing him pounce while he can.  Both SD and Oakland have had much worse stadium situations for far, far longer (cough cough public funding cough) and by the precedence that has been set by prior NFL franchises looking to relocate, Kronke for all intents and purposes is cutting in line...  TL;DR - Kronke isn't doing LA fans a favor, he just thinks you'll give more money year round..."

StLouisRams,2vcoit,TheDuke13,-6,Tue Feb 10 10:37:54 2015 UTC,The problem is one side of the discussion isn't capable of having an intelligent conversation as you point out. To them everything is Stan Kroenke is the anti christ and everything is his fault. The fact of the matter is like /u/ChalupaLoompa this situation was created by GF going against the NFL's wishes and moving the team for her own personal gain. Not the teams and not the fans. And now 20 years later the horrible deal she signed with the city leaders has come full circle and people realize how badly they got screwed. The Rams are well within their rights to go year to year on the lease.  A new stadium proposal in St Louis isn't to the owners liking so he's going to try to move the team. The NFL knows they're better off with a team in LA and after taunting cities and teams with the ability to relocate to LA they realize they have to actually do it or people won't believe the bluff again in the future. Not only that but with everything this stadium and complex that Kroenke is proposing will benefit the NFL in the end and they'll make the move happen.   Yes it sucks the Rams are leaving St Louis and I feel bad for the fans. As was pointed out in the first post in this thread they honestly never should have left LA to begin with. Both sides of this fan base have felt that pain. Hopefully everybody will still remain Rams fans at the end of this all. Though I've seen some say they'll go and support the Az Cardinals which I just can't fathom for the life of me.

Kroenke isn't interested in taking out loans to fund a stadium he doesn't own. The city isn't interested (or even capable) in fully funding a stadium for an owner not willing to commit to the city.   The Rams are leaving St Louis. You'd be very naive to not think so. It's obviou$.
StLouisRams,2vcgj5,Kaos047,3,Mon Feb 9 23:06:47 2015 UTC,Why don't you go ahead and go to the LA Rams subreddit then? No reason to stick around here since they have already left according to you.
StLouisRams,2vcgj5,eight26,-7,Tue Feb 10 00:11:15 2015 UTC,Your suggestion has been noted and filed. Thank you for your contribution.   Edit: This is a Rams sub not a St Louis Rams sub. Stop being bitches about your city's inability to be an economically viable NFL city.

StLouisRams,2vcgj5,eight26,-3,Tue Feb 10 01:41:21 2015 UTC,Compelling point. You should forward that to Kroenke too.
StLouisRams,2vcgj5,Popolar,2,Tue Feb 10 01:49:51 2015 UTC,"Why are you still talking. You're the only one who is acting butthurt over this entire situation. If you're so sure that they're going to move, why do you need to parade around on a STL subreddit (yes, it is a STL subreddit.) telling people that they're wrong for believing the team will stay in STL?   To me, it sounds like you're trying to convince yourself that this move is going to happen. That you're actually unsure whether or not it will happen. It's either that, or you simply have too much time on your hands, my friend.   Please stop trolling /r/stlouisrams. I ask you as a fellow fan. There's no need for you to hate me other than the fact that I live in St. Louis and I want the Rams to stay there, which is a pretty dumb reason to hate me in the first place. I could care less if you post here as a rams fan (hell, I even encourage it), but don't degrade a city and people that you know absolutely nothing about."

StLouisRams,2v8zn2,PRE_-CISION-_,3,Tue Feb 10 03:05:19 2015 UTC,Alec Ogletree is slowly morphing into one of my favorite Rams LBs ever
StLouisRams,2v8zn2,tayo569,1 point,Mon Feb 9 08:04:51 2015 UTC,He really is. I'm almost liking him as much as Laurinaitis which is damn hard to do.
StLouisRams,2v8zn2,axle69,3,Tue Feb 10 03:06:04 2015 UTC,I would argue his pass coverage is one of his stronger assets.  I'd just like to see more consistency.  Hope he shows up ready to take the next step next season.
StLouisRams,2v8zn2,corbilm,3,Mon Feb 9 08:56:13 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/tayo569 his coverage skills are pretty good a good portion of the time but it's as if he takes plays off now and again and his inconsistencies get him burned on run and pass. His game playing spy on Russell Wilson was pretty inept but he was an absolute force against Manning and company.

StLouisRams,2v90v6,DiscoJer,7,Mon Feb 9 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"Fantex is such a sketchy deal man. If you want real money invest in the stock market. What you are buying when you buy a share of an athlete is to randomly bring it up in conversation 'hey, I own part of Brockers career' sounds cool but in reality you will likely never gain any money.   An interesting concept, but prepare to lose a lot of cash on the deal."
StLouisRams,2v90v6,BilllyMayes,3,Mon Feb 9 02:03:19 2015 UTC,"Basically, he's sold a part of his future earnings to a company, and you can invest in it, according to this article.   If you have a favorite football player, you might hang his picture on the wall or wear his jersey on game days. Now, you also can own a piece of his career.  Michael Brockers, a defensive tackle for the St. Louis Rams, is the latest player to sign a contract with Fantex, a San Francisco company that issues shares tied to athletes’ career earnings.  The appeal for Brockers is clear: He gets $3.4 million upfront. In a sport where careers are short and injuries are common, the cash is a form of career insurance.  The value for potential investors is less clear. Buyers of Brockers’ tracking shares are entitled to 10 percent of his earnings from football, endorsements and related endeavors, such as a broadcasting or coaching job after he’s done playing."
StLouisRams,2v90v6,Kaos047,1 point,Mon Feb 9 01:10:32 2015 UTC,"That seems like a terrible deal for the player. I understand short careers and all that, but does he really think hes only going to make around 40 - 45 million his entire career(Assuming he invests this 3.4 million)?"
StLouisRams,2v7lva,FoxyZach,6,Sun Feb 8 18:13:34 2015 UTC,"Overall I'd give our rookie class an A based on their rookie performances.  Obviously it's too soon to tell if they'll continue to improve and be contributing members of the team, but the future looks bright.  G Rob: C - Everyone knew he wouldn't be ready to play LT out of the gate, we didn't draft him thinking he'd be our LT his first year. Unfortunately the injury gods had other plans and Rob was forced to play LT before his time. The game against the Giants is indicative of his entire rookie season. There were plays where he mauled and dominated JPP, then there were plays where he just got embarrassed or looked lost.  AD99: A+++++ - AP and PFWA Defensive Rookie of the Year, Pro-Bowl, 9 sacks, 19 tackles for loss. AD99 was a beast and is already one of the best DTs in the NFL. If he improves at all in his 2nd year, he may be the best outright.  Joyner: C+ - Joyner was pretty solid when he played. Unfortunately he had injury problems his rookie year, which was a concern coming out of college because of his small size. He has the talent, if he can just stay on the field.  Tre Mason: A - Most fans wondered why the hell we drafted a RB when we already had Stacy and Cunningham in the mix. Myself included. Well now we know. Tre Mason earned the starting spot this year and impressed. Behind one of the shittiest O lines in the NFL, with almost no passing game to speak of, he managed to crank out 765 yds at 4.3 YPC and 4 TDs in 11 starts. If we can get a competent O line in front of him, I can't wait to see what he can do.  Mo Alexander D - Didn't do much other than play special teams this year and he didn't really stand out there. You don't expect much from 4th rounders their first year though, so we'll have to wait and see before we know what he can do.  EJ Gaines A - You don't expect much from 4th rounder like Mo, but you hardly even expect 6th and 7th rounders to make the final roster. Not only did Gaines make the team, but after being forced into a starting role due to injuries, he flourished. Gaines was our most consistently good CB this year, with only a few rookie mistakes sprinkled in. Still, 16 pass deflections, 2 INTs and 70 tackles is impressive for any CB, even more so a 6th round rookie. He lead all rookie CBs in tackles and pass deflections, with only Kyle Fuller having more interceptions.  Everyone past Gaines didn't make the team, which is expected with most 6th and 7th rounders.  All and all a pretty damn good draft so far through their first year. If these guys improve, this could be a great draft."
StLouisRams,2v7lva,frankoftank,3,Sun Feb 8 20:43:57 2015 UTC,They did well. Donald is shaping up to be the best draft choice the Rams have made since Orlando Pace.
StLouisRams,2v7lva,mikeymora21,2,Sun Feb 8 21:15:10 2015 UTC,"EJ Gaines gets a B for being a good enough CB that he didn't play like a 'rookie'. He can be a starter if he keeps developing awareness.  G Rob gets a C+ although he has a lot more upside than Gaines, so I hope he can become a better pass protector and help out the QB.  Donald gets an A."
StLouisRams,2v7lva,09-11-2001,2,Sun Feb 8 18:45:39 2015 UTC,Donald: A+  Robinson: C+  Mason: A-  Gaines: B+  Joyner: C
StLouisRams,2v7lva,ITameFatGirls,2,Sun Feb 8 19:27:14 2015 UTC,"Gaines, Donald, Mason all A's  Robinson a C, basically did what I thought, he was raw coming in, everyone knew it would take some time to work in his pass-pro.  Joyner needs to be moved to FS, he's got the range, I'd like to see him there, can't be as bad as McLeod, few can."
StLouisRams,2v7lva,New_DudeToo,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:41:16 2015 UTC,I think we may have drafted better than anyone. Barring we had 2 first rounders. We got talent that play substantial minutes as rookies. We just have to be patient as a franchise to get the QB we need and deserve. I really hope Bradford can stay healthy this year if we don't make any off season moves. We are a good QB away from being a contender for the postseason I feel
StLouisRams,2v5e4n,BilllyMayes,5,Sun Feb 8 01:35:00 2015 UTC,"But at some point, You really need to weigh the cons against the pros and ask yourself, Is he really worth it?  In all seriousness though, I'm really enjoying these write-ups so far, I hope we'll see more of them for a while!"
StLouisRams,2v5e4n,SonicRainboom,2,Sun Feb 8 03:57:48 2015 UTC,I plan on trying to get a player a day. The ultimate goal is to hit all players that I think will be on the team come training camp (minus draft picks of course). Good distraction from the LA stuff.

Cignetti was most successful serving as the offensive coordinator at Fresno State for four years from 2002 until 2006. In 2004, Fresno State's offense ranked fifth nationally and seventh in 2005. In 2004 Fresno State became the sixth team in NCAA history to score over 50 points in four consecutive games.

Offense has to be tailored to the personnel, and the strengths of the QB.

StLouisRams,2v4g6j,Magnemmike,20,Sat Feb 7 20:33:38 2015 UTC,I hope to god they don't move and I have hope that it won't happen but I'm so fucking done with these talks and this sub. This fan base has officially been split in half and you have guys like /u/magnemmike who are very pro LA move stirring the pot. I don't care for the other side of the coin any better because if they don't move it sucks for the LA fans to get all amped but that being said this is still /r/stlouisrams and I hate seeing people down voted in it for blind optimism that they stay in STL.
StLouisRams,2v4g6j,axle69,8,Sun Feb 8 00:52:20 2015 UTC,Split in half? It's not like pro LA fans are gonna mutiny or split apart. We're just yearning for the Rams to come back the same way you guys are hoping they stay. It's not like we hate you guys.
StLouisRams,2v4g6j,mikeymora21,2,Sun Feb 8 18:47:40 2015 UTC,That's why I added that I didn't care for STL fans doing the same. I'd root for the Rams in LA if they did move because their my team and if another team came to St Louis I wouldn't stop my Rams fandom one bit but I'd cheer for them too.  P.s. Sorry that dudes obviously 11 and very upset for some reason.

There's no reason to believe they will be in LA in 2015.  Also, they're just starting the parts of the project the land is already zoned for (residential and commercial), which makes this almost a non story. At this point, though, it seems like a sure thing that the stadium initiative will pass."
StLouisRams,2v4g6j,Seductive_Santa,3,Sat Feb 7 20:45:46 2015 UTC,It technically already has.  They have enough signatures to continue without vote.    Probably need stan to get more owners on his side and then the announcer will come.
StLouisRams,2v4g6j,TheMightyCaige,3,Sat Feb 7 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"There won't be a lame duck season. They won't announce a move unless they are moving in the next few months.   Now, he might announce he's keeping the team in St. Louis."
StLouisRams,2v4g6j,daveman312,2,Sat Feb 7 21:36:31 2015 UTC,"If he keeps them there for 2015 season there won't be an announcement.  They had already said the contract has gone year to year. So the announcement would be the move,  and playing the rose bowl or coliseum."
StLouisRams,2v4g6j,TheDuke13,2,Sat Feb 7 21:49:14 2015 UTC,The league said no relocation for 2015. The Rams are playing their 16 (or more) home games in St. Louis for 2015.  This announcement will probably tell us nothing TBH.
StLouisRams,2v4g6j,mr_rightnow,6,Sat Feb 7 21:51:51 2015 UTC,"We're getting 16 home games next season?! Doesn't seem fair but I'll take it!! ;)   All joking aside, I agree with you. The Rams will be in St. Louis next season. Although, it was Goodell who said no relocation for 2015. You have a lot more faith in him than I do if you think he wouldn't say something at one point then do something else later."
StLouisRams,2v4g6j,eight26,2,Sat Feb 7 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, the NFL said that.  But if all the owners are in agreement, vote for Stan and he puts in by the deadline of feb 15.  If it's going to happen, it will be this week.   The NFL does whatever the owners say."

The President is required by law to present a budget proposal, which is then sent to Congress where it is amended (read: changed completely) to whatever it is that Congress wants to do. The real power in the budget process are the budget committee chairs. In reality, the final budget will not resemble this proposal at all, and likely will not include anything that will harm public financing of sports arenas.

StLouisRams,2uw3cq,bwc_28,2,Thu Feb 5 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"Expect the same thing we had under Schottenheimer. He ran the offense Fisher wanted him to, so it'll be more of the same."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,SonicRainboom,4,Thu Feb 5 18:56:53 2015 UTC,"TBH, I didn't mind a lot of Shotty's play calling. I mean, of course there were unforgivable mistakes that can never be taken back, but at the end of the day the Rams could show a pretty efficient offense every once in  a while. I feel that if this guy patches up some of Shotty's cons (Ex, Shotty not making any late game adjustments, calling short yardage plays on long downs, the inexplicable misuse of Tayvon Austin, etc) but otherwise keeps the same offensive game plan, especially with a (hopefully) capable quarterback and a restructured Oline, I feel like we can be much more successful on both sides of the ball next season."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,rdrop,-2,Thu Feb 5 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"of course their were unforgivable mistakes that can never be taken back  the Rams could show a pretty efficient offense every once in a while.   I'm applying for a surgical residency spot next year when I graduate from medical school. In our line of work ""unforgivable mistakes"" and doing operations that work ""every once in a while"" is utterly unacceptable. If we can hold ourselves to this fine level of scrutiny and dillegence, why can't a billion dollar professional football club?"
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,Tre2,2,Thu Feb 5 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"That's really not the same thing. If a basketball player missed 10% of his shots, he would be a legend, but if a musician missed 10% of notes, he would suck."

I was flamed with a similar sentiment when I commented on the Hawks not running Lynch at the FUGGING ONE YARD LINE IN THE SUPERBOWL. Like, gee... normal football fans can't have or express an opinion on the merits of football strategy. Who knew?).    But, seriously, how would you utilize him (Austin)?"
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,HighSilence,10,Thu Feb 5 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"But, seriously, how would you utilize him (Austin)?   Not running him between the tackles would be a good start"
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,SQLDave,1 point,Thu Feb 5 21:28:45 2015 UTC,I believe he had pretty decent ypc in those calls. Might seem stupid on the surface but there was production there if I remember correctly. I stopped minding the up the middle run with Tavon when I saw the numbers. It forces him to just fucking run forward thereby taking away one of his weaknesses: hesitation to pick a route to run through.
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,NewBroPewPew,1 point,Fri Feb 6 21:42:53 2015 UTC,"LOL...  yeah, there's that. I mean, once in a blue moon to catch the D off guard, but holy cripes it seems like they were doing it 10 or more times in some games. Almost like Shotty was saying ""Look out out-of-the-box I can think""."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,bwc_28,3,Thu Feb 5 22:36:01 2015 UTC,He had a 6.2 yard average. Him just lining up in the back field created favorable match ups all over the field. He has the same bodytype as Chris Johnson who had 2k yards in a season based of just speed.
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,SQLDave,7,Thu Feb 5 22:38:34 2015 UTC,"Johnson weighs 30 pounds more and is three inches taller than Tayvon, they don't remotely have the same body type."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,Yji,2,Fri Feb 6 03:25:08 2015 UTC,"6.2 YPC between the tackles? Even if so, he seems too small to pound in there very often. Could just be my (wrong) impression, though."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,DiscoJer,2,Thu Feb 5 22:41:45 2015 UTC,"No one's denying that it was successful, but when that's all you're using the guy on, you aren't getting back the investment you put into it. He needs to be used a lot more in a receiver role."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,Yji,-2,Thu Feb 5 22:42:53 2015 UTC,The reason he was used like that is because he stinks as a receiver.   They're trying to get some value out of him.
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,SonicRainboom,2,Fri Feb 6 00:11:21 2015 UTC,"He's really not that bad. You're really going to tell me he can't be used on things like go routes, post routes, curl routes, crossing routes, slant routes, screens? Yeah, he's not Isaac Bruce in route running, but he can run all those routes fine. You'd think he'd at least get chances as a receiver, not a running back."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,CatMinion,2,Fri Feb 6 00:37:44 2015 UTC,"I think he's a tool that we have, but maybe one we shouldn't rely on. He has spectacular speed and can move allover the field, but his size is somewhat of a problem. On top of that, he shows a lot of rookie mistakes, like turning up field too early, dancing around instead of just running up field, whatever. Fortunately, I think that that's all of set by just how dedicated he is to his team mates and the sport of football. He is always so happy and enjoying himself on the field, and he is completely comfortable taking a supportive position.  Despite what some people say, I don't believe our receiving corps is a problem, assuming Quick heals up and returns to having a stellar season and Britt resigns. We have some natural leaders on the field, and rookies that are willing to listen and learn from them.   Maybe Austin will turn into a great, reliable receiver one day, or maybe he'll prove to be a bust. For now, since we have him on the team, I think we should expand way we can use him as a weapon based on his speed, grit, and dedication to the team."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,PimSlickens,2,Fri Feb 6 04:01:11 2015 UTC,He's friends with Mike McCarthy. He worked with McCarthy when McCarthy was OC for the Saints. So hopefully he can bring some of that experience with him. It's not like Cignetti's only NFL experience is with the Schotty offense. My expectations aren't really high but I'll give the guy a chance. Surely he will look at what Schotty screwed up and at least try to fix the glaring mistakes.
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,BrawndoTTM,6,Fri Feb 6 03:37:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure how much you guys know about him, but this mystifies me. I am a huge Fresno State fan and he had some pretty horrendous years while there. He was basically run out of town, granted that was 10 years ago. Hopefully he has honed his skills since then."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,PimSlickens,10,Thu Feb 5 18:42:49 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia   Cignetti was most successful serving as the offensive coordinator at Fresno State for four years from 2002 until 2006. In 2004, Fresno State's offense ranked fifth nationally and seventh in 2005. In 2004 Fresno State became the sixth team in NCAA history to score over 50 points in four consecutive games. The 2004 team also led the Western Athletic Conference in average yards per carry and amassed 65 touchdowns.   How was he a disappointment?"
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,BrawndoTTM,8,Thu Feb 5 19:25:31 2015 UTC,"Much like most of our recent history, we started out the year with a high-powered offense that would consistently be creative and was able to generate points. However, as the year progressed, we would simply run the same type of plays over and over again that the defense would easily pick up on and be able to stop. This was never more clear on third down and in key 4th quarter drives.  There would be times when every fan in the stadium would know what was coming and the defense would line right up and stop the play in its tracks. This frustration led to what I was referring to. Notice how the above stats do not mention win loss records or bowl victories. While we did squeak out a victory in 2004, 2005's bowl game (Frank's last) was one of the worst called games I have ever seen our team play."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,MengTheBarbarian,15,Thu Feb 5 20:22:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm, that sucks. Frankly it sounds a lot like Schotty, except for that part where they start with a high-powered offense that would consistently be creative and was able to generate points."
StLouisRams,2uw3cq,NichtEinmalFalsch,6,Thu Feb 5 21:10:48 2015 UTC,Pete Carroll reinvented himself after New England. Let's hope Franky can do the same.  I just want to win ;_;

StLouisRams,2uw3cq,TweetPoster,2,Thu Feb 5 21:44:27 2015 UTC,"Given how unappealing this job had apparently become leaguewide, trying to find a diamond in the rough among our position coaches was really the only option.

StLouisRams,2uycjv,BrawndoTTM,2,Fri Feb 6 18:44:24 2015 UTC,The problem with him according to fans is people keep trying to make him play tackle when he should be a guard.  It's the one reason I'd say yes to this. Try him out. There's no way he'll be expensive after getting dumped like that.

StLouisRams,2uycjv,woostar64,1 point,Sat Feb 7 01:08:01 2015 UTC,I'd be on board with this. We won't have to pay too much for him. He could be a depth tackle but he could also be someone who could excel at guard if given the chance. His game as a whole just seems better suited as a guard.
StLouisRams,2uycjv,MaceWindude,1 point,Sat Feb 7 14:10:04 2015 UTC,"His name makes him more expensive, we could sign someone of equal talent for far less."

StLouisRams,2uww1b,Chatum_Tanning,0,Fri Feb 6 22:23:14 2015 UTC,Regardless of where this team plays I don't want Kronke as the owner. He doesn't give two shits about any of his teams and when Stan eventually goes his son will take over which is even worse. If you pay attention to the NBA look no further than what is going on with the Denver Nuggets.
StLouisRams,2urw2p,BrawndoTTM,24,Wed Feb 4 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, and all day.    That call was good, and I recommend they do it that way again in the future. I think it shows pretty deep clock management skills and very good game theory.   Wilson fucked up that play, he should have thrown it in the dirt or to the back of the endzone. (or you can make the argument that the Pats D made a fucking amazing play, or a combination of both.  The call was good because it gives the Seahawks a guaranteed 4th down if needed. They ran 2nd down with 20 seconds left...if that's a run, clocking the ball might give you 10 seconds...MIGHT but they're going to take the time out more likely if they don't make it.   At that point you're at 3rd down with about 15-10 seconds left, no time outs, and maybe 1 or 2 yards to go. In that situation you HAVE to pass...HAVE to. So that ties their hands play call wise. Also, at that point...Sack on 3rd down ends the game, any screen or lateral stopped short ends the game.  It was a high percentage play (I heard they ran it 60 times over the course of the season, and the Superbowl was the only INT or loss of yards).  Cliffnotes: Good play call, terrible execution, incredible defense. I want that OC on our team."
StLouisRams,2urw2p,chakan2,6,Wed Feb 4 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"Good explanation!  It does seem a little odd that Bevell is getting a hurricane force circlejerk of hate while Wilson is more or less insulated from criticism.I feel like if that was Romo or Manning throwing that pick, the driving narrative would be a lot different."
StLouisRams,2urw2p,chakan2,3,Wed Feb 4 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"Heh, that's a good point...I just kind of expect a play like that out of Romo, and it would have been to easy to blame it on manning being injured.   Wilson was mostly good with ball security throughout the season,  but everyone forgot he just came off a 4 int game (or was it 5).   Anyway, that play was the right call. Execution, good or bad depending on your worldview, decided that game."
StLouisRams,2urw2p,JosephBlowFish,2,Wed Feb 4 18:36:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that Wilson could have placed it better, but I actually tend to agree more with Bevell that Lockette and Kearse were out of position; particularly Lockette.  I also just listened to a podcast that Kurt Warner did with some Seattle radio guys where he confirmed that same idea.  There will be a lot of opinions about this play for a long time. It was controversial for good reason. But that said, even with all of my frustrations with Bevell, this is not one of them, and I'd rather keep him in Seattle all things considered."
StLouisRams,2urw2p,czah7,3,Thu Feb 5 07:03:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  So many media outlets aren't saying this.  They are just bashing SEA for the call.    They couldn't run 4downs!  People don't understand that.  They needed to throw at some point.  Why not then?  It was a risky throw, not even a bad throw, just a risky one.  And NE made an amazing break and great INT.  That's it.  End of game.  Honestly they should not have even been that close.  The catch that got them there was a miracle.  I feel like Loki watches Seahawk games and just fucks with people."
StLouisRams,2urw2p,FaulktheBlueRedbird,2,Wed Feb 4 20:49:13 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a bad play call on paper. It was a bad play call because Bevell took a risk, however marginal, on the one yard line in a close 3 point Super Bowl game. He put his faith in Wilson in a situation where it wasn't warranted in relation to all available options. That's what made it a bad play call.   They had 2nd, 3rd, and 4th down to let Marshawn Lynch to take it in for ONE yard."

StLouisRams,2urw2p,Bora-Bora-Bora,1 point,Thu Feb 5 02:06:31 2015 UTC,"Eh. I think the pass was a good idea, but they should've run something better than a simple pick play with Kearse against Browner. I was pretty certain they'd roll Wilson out on play action."
StLouisRams,2urw2p,shadeshadows,1 point,Thu Feb 5 05:08:50 2015 UTC,"Seattle should have run and taken their timeout. If they had run on second down (the safer, higher percentage play), they could have called their final timeout if they didn't make it. Then, you get a pass into the end zone on third. Of course, a sack here would end it, but it should be a quick pass or bootleg. Then, if that's incomplete, you get a fourth.    Don't get me wrong, I think he's a good OC, but in that case, he didn't make the safer/higher percentage call."
StLouisRams,2urw2p,chakan2,2,Wed Feb 4 19:52:43 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you if the previous run play hadn't just eaten 30 seconds off the clock. They ran it with over a minute left (I believe, I was drunk, so forgive me if I'm spouting BS). I was wondering why Belichek didn't call his timeout there to conserve the clock @ 1 min.   With the play call they made, guaranteed 4 downs, if they run with 20 seconds left, it's a high percentage chance of 4 downs, but not a lock, and potential loss of game on 3rd down on a sack or stop.   Logic says pass, your heart says run. If that played out the exact same way 100 times, I think settle would win 80% of those. If they run there, I think they only win 60%. (I think the real numbers are like 99% / 50% according to statics on passes in the redzone for the hawks)."
StLouisRams,2urw2p,axle69,2,Wed Feb 4 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"While I agree thats what they should have done its not the ""higher percentage play"" even in the simplest of sense. The amount of times a run play has been ran inside the 2 yard line this season (229) roughly 57% of the time it has worked. Lynch himself has run it inside that portion 5 times this year and he only managed to do it once. The amount of times that a pass play was called inside that range (108 times) it was converted 60+% of the time and there weren't any interceptions in that range all year."
StLouisRams,2urw2p,axle69,4,Wed Feb 4 20:10:14 2015 UTC,I don't care for the fact that he threw Ricardo Lockette under the bus even if it was the correct play call (still debateable in my opinion but there are upsides to that call). He also had a pretty decent set of consequences over in Seattle with Wilson and Lynch and even the group of mediocre receivers is better than some teams have. All of that being said he didn't have dick to work with in their O-Line and somehow helped create a top 10 offense multiple years running with it and it wouldn't take much to be better then Schottenheimer.
StLouisRams,2urw2p,bozo7337,3,Wed Feb 4 20:25:18 2015 UTC,As a side note the Rams had 6 plays from the one yard line in 2014. They ran it twice once they scored. Passed it four times and scored three.
StLouisRams,2urw2p,DeniseDeNephew,2,Thu Feb 5 00:59:08 2015 UTC,"I suppose I'd rather have Bevell than Boras or Cignetti but I will be surprised if they let him go. Teams that fire coaches to appease angry fans are not the kind of teams that go to consecutive Super Bowls.  And right after Quinn left?   Teams do that kind of housecleaning but not usually after coming so close to winning a SB.  If they had gotten blown out it would be more likely but theen again stranger things have happened.  My only concern is that Percy Harvin never seemed to do much in Seattle, especially as a receiver.  We've seen enough flashes from Tavon to see his potential and whoever we hire for OC needs to be able to turn that potential into results and if Percy Harvin is any indication then Bevell doesn't know how to do that.    This OC search is really getting frustrating.  All the big names are off the board, we've heard the rumors about an internal hire, and still nothing has happened.  I was hoping that the delay meant that they were targeting someone from either of the SB teams but that doesn't seem to be the case.  And what was with that tweet from Ian Rapoport about Hackett pulling out of the search?  More to this one for sure.  What more is there that we don't know about?  What happened that made Hackett remove his name from consideration?   Whatever it is, has it played a factor in any of the other big name OCs going elsewhere?   I know some people think the potential move to LA is the problem but that doesn't seem realistic.  The days of a guy like Tom Landry staying with one team for almost 30 years are long gone and there are few OCs and DCs who can think they can set down roots -- do poorly and you get fired, do well and you get offers for more money as a HC in another city, and if your HC fails you probably get tossed out with him.  So what is it?  Is it Fisher insisting on running the offense his way?  He's a defensive coach, would he really demand control of the offense especially given the poor offensive results on the field?  Let's say this team finishes 6-10 next year and Fisher gets the axe -- who will want him?  A HC needs to build a staff more than he needs to draw up plays and if he is driving away OC talent out of stubbornness then he is dooming himself.  OTOH, if he can hire an OC who can do to this offense what Williams did to the defense then he is not going anywhere and his reputation as a .500 coach will go away.    I'm trying to stay positive about this whole thing but it's hard when we get see guys going elsewhere and get no news about our own team.  This is a critical hire at a critical time so Snead and Fisher need to be deliberate but so far it looks like paralysis by analysis -- make a damn decision!"

Literally the ONLY reason I could see for Hackett withdrawing was getting a better offer elsewhere and I assumed this was the case. But as far as I've heard, that never happened. So why did he pull out? He's not even that good an OC, No way he gets a HC offer, and at this point it's looking unlikely he'll even be an OC in the NFL next year. Why give up his shot with the Rams?"

After a couple years Rams fans are calling for Shotty to be fired.    Seahawks fans have been calling for Bevells head for a couple years, he is finally fired(hypothetically) and some Rams fans have open arms for him? I see a trend here. Let's get away from retreads fired for not doing their job well. I understand that a change of scenery is all some people need but is that the case with Bevell?  I don't know that he gets fired but just like Greg Roman I'd pass on him coming to the Rams."

I only hate the Seahawks when it benefits the Rams, which is most of the time. I do have a begrudging respect for our division rivals, even the Cardinals, who betrayed my city.   In contrast, my burning hatred for the Patriots could not be quenched by the mighty Mississippi. I honestly think I may have enjoyed the ending of the '07 season more than the '99. I bought an Enquirer just because it rumored some marital problems with Giselle and Tom. I refuse to wear hoodies.  Believe me, my hatred for the Seahawks will be at an all time high next season. I will only be satisfied if they finish in the bottom of the division. Not because of rivalry, but because they let the Pats win."

We really don't have any other options outside of Bradford at QB who make me a little optimistic.  We look good at running back. I kind of dislike Jared Cook and Kendricks but they're effective for the most part.  I'd like to make sure Quick returns before passing on a receiver in the draft. I'd either take a first round WR or pass altogether. Re-sign Britt.   Wouldn't mind cutting Jake Long and Scott Wells and drafting some O-line help, as boring as that is.  At safety, I wouldn't mind upgrading McLeod. Liked what I saw from Barron though he looks like a designed blitzer. We just get burned deep so many times, it's time to upgrade. Maybe a veteran makes more sense.  Some linebacker depth would be nice. Maybe a veteran would be nice there too.  Id say we're set at D-line, though I'd be okay with cutting Langford, and cornerback. Punter and kicker are fine.  I'm pessimistic the offense will drag as much as ever with an internal OC, which it will probably end up being, though anything is better than Schotty in my opinion.   Wouldn't mind drafting DGB if Fisher thinks he can fix him. As a Mizzou fan, he's tough for root for, though he's a top 5 talent.  As a side note, is anyone else struggling to get excited about the Rams with all the talk about this move? It's kind of putting a damper on the offseason for me... Can anyone check me back in?"
StLouisRams,2unl23,Sinisterminister77,9,Tue Feb 3 17:53:32 2015 UTC,"I really think our play calling would be decent with a QB the coaches have faith in. You aren't exactly opening up the playbook for Hill or Davis. So I'm optimistic about our chances with Foles or a healthy Bradford. We have a ton of talent across the board, secondary and O line notwithstanding. Snead and Fish will likely have another solid draft, and we just have to hope we can get decent QB play.   I know this won't be a popular opinion, but I'm incredibly excited about the move. I live 30 minutes from LA so the chance to see the Rams for the very first time in a brand new stadium is a dream come true. But I am sorry (if it happens) for the St Louis fans. They've been nothing but supportive."

StLouisRams,2unl23,GaslightProphet,5,Wed Feb 4 04:56:28 2015 UTC,"In the face of limited or no news, pessimism is natural.   Keep in mind that there are plenty of people fighting hard to keep the team here, and that things will play out in time. As the Riverfront stadium development progresses, we will have a better understanding of our team's future in STL.   In the movie Wall Street, Hal Holbrook said: ""Man looks into the abyss, there's nothing looking back at him. At that moment, man finds his character. And that is what keeps him out of the abyss."" It's a variation of a Nietzche quote, offering hope in the face of darkness...  Right now, Rams fans are looking into the abyss of Inglewood. Only by staying fans of our team, and demonstrating that they are ours, can we show the NFL Owners that we have earned our team. And while the abyss is terrifying by its nature, with emptiness and nothingness staring back at us, we must have the strength to endure, to prove our worthiness, and thereby have the strength to endure. It's about faith, and hope, that the right actions will take place for us to keep our team.   Meanwhile, I see the Rams coming into 2015 with a solid lineup of players that could very much use a QB like Foles. Meanwhile, I see the NFC West opening up for us as the 49ers have their own problems, and who knows what the blowback of their Super Bowl loss will have on the mental integrity of the Seahawks. Arizona has their own issues at QB, too. This could very well be the year the Rams play above .500 and compete for a playoff spot. In the interim, let's hope we get a quality OC."

StLouisRams,2unl23,oxygenjoe,7,Wed Feb 4 02:18:15 2015 UTC,"A realistic best-case scenario is a healthy Sam Bradford who plays up to the potential he showed as a rookie, another solid draft, a free agent or two to fill in the O-line, no dropoff for any of this year's rookies, a creative OC who will be a little more aggressive than Schotty was and Fisher is, a D-line that comes out firing on all cylinders instead of having 1 sack in the first 5 games, and a team that comes out of the preseason looking prepared to play instead of coming out flat and taking several weeks to hit their stride.  Less realistic scenarios just for fun:   Bradford throws for >4000 yards Quick has >1000 yards receiving Bailey also has >1000 yards receiving Tavon leads NFL in all-purpose yards Quinn leads NFL in sacks  Donald plays even better in his second year, ESPN and /r/NFL end their JJ Watt bromance and AD gets months of MVP talk instead GZ misses zero FGs all season, including one from 70 4 players on defense and 2 on offense named Pro Bowl starters Tavon Austin, Pro Bowl MVP   I think all of those are possible and if even one happens it will mean that 2015 will be a better season than 2014 was."

StLouisRams,2ulmyo,eight26,4,Tue Feb 3 04:42:56 2015 UTC,"Loyd's job is to help manage the Riverfront stadium's development with an emphasis on effecting best practices in its construction.  His hiring also demonstrates that STL is committing capital to the Riverfront stadium, that the region is very interested in seeing it built. The NFL has stated that STL needs a new stadium if it hopes to keep the Rams; this helps show that we intend to keep our team rather than just letting Kroenke take it from us while we remain indifferent. After all, we want our team here."
StLouisRams,2ulmyo,SoulardSTL,2,Tue Feb 3 19:14:41 2015 UTC,3 or even 2 years ago was the time to do this.
StLouisRams,2ulmyo,eight26,4,Tue Feb 3 20:03:59 2015 UTC,"I've heard that the efforts to put together the new stadium have been going on for some time, that the Governor's press conference to announce the Stadium Commission came about only after they had been actively working on it for maybe a year. Meanwhile, 2-3 years ago would have been during the arbitration hearings.   Remember the Dome contract involved just the EJD, not another viable stadium. If they had announced a new open air stadium five years ago and had it ready to go today, it still wouldn't necessarily keep the Rams here. That was the big reason only a half-assed effort was given for the EJD renovations, because even if they dumped $500MM into it, it still would only have been for a contract that expires in ten years' time, after that Kroenke could relocate the team anyways. In a parallel universe, if they had announced plans for a new stadium, Kroenke could still option not to take it.   I think Loyd being announced now is reasonable. Better than waiting any longer for the first consultant hiring."
StLouisRams,2ulmyo,SoulardSTL,-1,Tue Feb 3 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"This shouldn't even qualify as an article, it says nothing noteworthy here.

StLouisRams,2uo7ll,Magnemmike,19,Tue Feb 3 20:06:52 2015 UTC,"Misleading Title - That's not what this article says.   Governor Nixon recently stated that the bonds currently utilized for the EJD could be repurposed to the Riverfront Stadium's development without first having to seek approval from the Missouri General Assembly, that the current laws allow for this to happen. In response, a rival Missouri Senator from St. Joseph filed a bill, a resolution, to create a new law stating Nixon would have to get permission from the General Assembly to repurpose a bond. Not from this article, but they're looking at bonds valued at or greater than $50MM with this resolution. They're not saying ""no"" to the stadium, they're saying ""no"" to the Governor's interpretation of the law.   While the General Assembly may or may not support public financing involved in the Riverfront Stadium plan, that is not yet an issue. What is at hand is the Governor stating his office could repurpose the bonds without the prior approval of the General Assembly. Absolutely, it did not state that the Missouri Senate has said ""no"" to the Riverfront Stadium."

StLouisRams,2uo7ll,BrettGilpin,-19,Fri Feb 6 19:10:21 2015 UTC,"St. Louis cannot get it together. Spending time trying to convince yourselves that the stadium is worth it.  And I do mean convincing yourselves as there is a bigger percentage that does not want to give money for a new stadium.  Your people in charge do not want to give up funds or allocate funds to make it happen as well.     This will cost you the team. I understand many do not like me as I am from Los Angeles, so this will bring me downvotes and many probably won't bother to hear my comments.  Fine.  The bare truth is that St. Louis isn't willing to keep to the contract, many don't want to hand out to a billionaire who can easily do it all himself. (Completely understandable) But,   This billionaire is willing to spend money for his own stadium in Inglewood, probably knowing that St. Louis had no chance in providing a first tier stadium as the contract was written.    No available funds,  politicians can't agree to funds, ""fans"" are not fully invested to show up to the games.    The writing has been on the wall for quite sometime."
StLouisRams,2uo7ll,Chatum_Tanning,11,Tue Feb 3 23:09:19 2015 UTC,"Get some air bro,you're worrying too much about this stadium stuff. You're not a politician in either city or involved with Stan So chill out, and that goes for people from the Stl side too."
StLouisRams,2uo7ll,SoulardSTL,7,Tue Feb 3 23:33:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, STL is very much getting it together.   So far, we have a stadium proposal, land being accumulated, funding sources identified, and are hiring consultants to effect the plans. STL's leadership is unified on keeping our team; I was at a meeting recently where the County Executive from across the river in IL spoke fervently of supporting the team, and coming from STL believe me that that means a lot. We have a dual-use design that MLS appreciates, and there are potential MLS franchise owners in town who are very, very interested in seeking out their 24th franchise, with the funding to support their efforts. That's more money and momentum to the new Riverfront Stadium development. We also have a fan base that has dutifully attended games in the face of the ongoing worst multi-year record in NFL history, fans that the color commentators for the games have credited on-air for their relentless support in the face of such adversity, including the team owner who has not once spoken publicly since acquiring majority ownership. STL also has the respect of many NFL owners who have publicly supported STL's efforts, and want a team in STL for geography alone, and are positioning themselves towards making sure the League's rules are followed for relocation (i.e. not letting Kroenke pull a ""Baltimore Colts"" on us).   We have funding, the support of the politicians that matter, and the fanbase which still celebrates our Saint Louis Rams since before their winning Super Bowl XXXIV.   I agree that the NFL has royally used LA for a number of years, and no one wants to get in a pissing match between LA and STL. And no matter what any of us say, it'll probably just end up in the courts anyways. That said, don't think that STL is ready to give up our team. There are plenty fans here, both of the Rams, the NFL, and Saint Louis itself, that are not going to give up our team without a fight."
StLouisRams,2uo7ll,SoulardSTL,-6,Wed Feb 4 00:30:52 2015 UTC,"The mls possibilities are great.  But what makes you so sure that's what Stan wants?   His stadium in inglewood (that he is happily funding) isn't fitting in a mls team. You have to take into consideration what the owner wants,  and he already has shown st louis what he wanted.  The ejd to have a retractable roof. He has rejected their first proposal, he probably doesn't want to spend money to build in St. Louis.  He doesn't have top spend anything by contract.  St. Louis has to provide first tier,  which I have also heard the new proposal is also not first tier.    You are still leaning on Stan to spend money,  to buddy up to a mls team, and that your city will somehow get the rest of the finances to build this new location.  All while Stan is pushing forward to inglewood.  He has the finances,  inglewood gave signatures in favor for the stadium.  Inglewood will vote in a couple months.  The NFL wants a team in Los Angeles, preferably two. He has jerry jones in favor of moving,  more owner votes are coming. In the planning and preparation, he is already a year ahead of St. Louis. At least a year.   Let's not forget the biggest reason for moving,  the value of the team.  The Rams will double or triple their value simply by moving.  Nothing will stand in front of a businessman trying to make more money."
StLouisRams,2uo7ll,eight26,4,Wed Feb 4 10:46:24 2015 UTC,"What Kroenke really wanted with the EJD renovations was for STL to pay for $800MM by itself, with no owner contributions, while eliminating a major chunk of the Downtown street grid, and not committing to keep the team playing in STL past the conclusion of the current lease agreement. Basically, he could get the EJD retrofitted to his requests, then leave STL all over again, with STL $800MM in the whole to get the stadium fixed specifically for a team that wasn't to play there any more.   That's why the EJD retrofit wasn't built.   Basically, it's obvious that Kroenke wants to be in LA. For the reasons you've mentioned, and more, he wants to be the NFL owner of the LA franchise. He wants that title, and he'd increase team value on it. And his opportunity to do that is to take the team that is currently in STL, where the NFL wants a team playing, and where a fan base currently exists and supports the team (despite playing like dogshit for years), and unilaterally moving them.   What STL is proposing is more to the NFL than to Kroenke, as he's just not answering the phone or even talking to anyone other than the Mayor of Inglewood. That's why STL is currently supported by many owners like Rooney who find Kroenke's actions questionable to say the least, and fully against NFL protocol.   Still, what is being proposed is much to the benefit of Kroenke. It's a brand new stadium, for which he'd likely only pay the minimum of $200MM. The MLS coming in would be a revenue stream that would allow him to only have to pay $200MM for a new stadium; that's why it's important. Plus, should he use his talents and resources as a real estate developer, he can make even more monies through concessions, parking, and retail by operating those facilities on-site for both NFL and MLS fans. As well, there are ancillary development opportunities nearby for other non-venue events, such as a music venue, as the development site would extend an existing retail and entertainment district.   Meanwhile, should the NFL owners continue to find his actions against the rules, total costs & fines against him could become too costly to any rogue relocation. Yes, he could move the team, but the costs of such a move could make it prohibitive: $200MM for team physical relocation; $1.5BB+ for construction of the new stadium (assuming no delays or issues in construction); $100MM/year for rent to another facility in LA, like the Rose Bowl, while Inglewood gets built (so easily $300MM); and punitive fees for the relocation that could very easily reach above $1BB imposed by the NFL owners.   Right there, for him to relocate the team to LA, he'd be actively paying $3BB+, for an illiquid increase in team valuation of $1BB.   Or, he pays $200MM in contribution to the new STL stadium for an increase in team valuation of $600MM, plus tax breaks.   Assuming he can take a $3BB hit to his liquid assets, these are his options."
StLouisRams,2uo7ll,SoulardSTL,-2,Wed Feb 4 21:19:57 2015 UTC,It's weird that you guys still act like this isn't happening.

StLouisRams,2uo7ll,eight26,4,Thu Feb 5 19:48:50 2015 UTC,"And I'm saying that I am a fan of my team. You keep trying to deny that, today, they are the Saint Louis Rams, as if you are confused why a Saint Louisan would cheer for his team. They are not today the Inglewood Rams. They may be in the future, but they are not today. And to question why I am supportive of my team, which is still my team, is not because of the ""denial stage of grief"", but because we are fighting to keep what is ours. Yes, LA had the Rams, then you lost them. You may see them return, but they are ours today, and we are fighting to keep them ours tomorrow. Can't blame a fan for being a fan, but you keep criticizing Saint Louis Rams fans for being fans of the Saint Louis Rams. That isn't weird...   Heads-up: This isn't a done deal. 2-3 weeks ago, I met up socially with an extended family member of Stan Kroenke (Stan does live in Columbia MO with family in Jefferson City MO). This guys is politically active and in the know. While at lunch, I asked him about the Rams, and he said it's probably 50/50 on where they end up, all biases and spin aside. Right now, it's a coin flip.  In the end, this whole thing sucks for LA and STL. You guys should have two expansion teams, both AFC and NFC, and at least one stadium already built. That said, I don't want to see my team go away, and many of us will fight to keep our team, hence the new STL stadium proposal and the support of many NFL owners."

StLouisRams,2uo7ll,Popolar,3,Thu Feb 5 22:46:44 2015 UTC,"You do realize that by saying he will fund a stadium in Inglewood but not St. Louis is a power play, right? This way, he forces St. Louis to come up with a plan now and pay for it.  That's not to say that he definitely won't move the team to LA. He is a businessman, and keeping options open is what a good businessman does.  LA has had multiple chances with NFL teams. More than one team has been there and left because the LA fanbase is so unstable. There is great potential because of the size of the population, but when you look at it from a business perspective, it is a very high risk move.   Think of it this way: If Kronke spends a billion dollars on a new stadium there and the Rams have a shitstreak like they have had in St. Louis for the last 10 years, then Kronke is out a billion dollars. He would have to be banking not only on the Rams to be a very successful long term team, but for the LA fanbase to show up to games as well."
StLouisRams,2uo7ll,SoulardSTL,-5,Thu Feb 5 06:15:53 2015 UTC,"Power plays?!?  You guys are in such denial.    When they move back to Los Angeles, and when we are talking about the team in /r/losangelesrams will you still be following the team or will you have moved on? Can't call Los Angeles an unstable fanbase for still supporting the team that left 20 years ago."
StLouisRams,2uo7ll,D9-EM,4,Thu Feb 5 06:48:31 2015 UTC,"No, that's just logic. You have zero counterpoints to what I just said, and you're also being extremely one sided.   The fact that r/losangelesrams exists proves basically nothing about how big or loyal your fan base is. Just that they're there. The fact that all of the LA fans are treating the rams like they're LA's team is both ignorant and disrespectful to STL fans. Remember that the reason they're in STL right now is because LA's fan base couldn't support the team in the first place.   While we're on the subject of rams sub reddits, r/stlouisrams has a very strong opposition to the team moving to LA. Does that mean that they're not going to? Absolutely not! The decision is going to come down to what Kronke wants to do with his money, whether or not he wants to take a risk.   Who the hell knows. There's a million reasons for him to move and there's a million reasons for him to stay."
StLouisRams,2uo7ll,D9-EM,1 point,Thu Feb 5 07:08:19 2015 UTC,"And you can't discredit a football team's fan base in its home town, which is Saint Louis. That is the Rams' ""stable fan base"". It hasn't been LA for 20+ years."

StLouisRams,2uo7ll,bozo7337,1 point,Fri Feb 6 05:23:16 2015 UTC,"No, you're harassing a significant portion of the fan base. That's why you're here. I have nothing against LA fans but YOU aren't a true fan imho. You're just a child. You weren't around when the Rams left your home. You never lost a team. So here you are... trying so hard to find significance by acting like what you are, a child."
StLouisRams,2uo7ll,ItsBiggy,-3,Fri Feb 6 05:46:47 2015 UTC,"Yes,  I do troll.  Although not a child. I was happily watching my Rams before they left.  Have been faithful all 20 years they were gone.   Watched as a horrible quarterback by the name of Tony banks throw horrible passes, and Jerome bettis knocking down the defensive line,  Tony zendejas kicking the ball. More recently when I saw them in San Diego and I got to meet both Vince ferragamo and Erik Dickerson.   I have been a long fan of my Rams.  And extremely happy for their return,   Not an expansion team, not the Chargers, not the raiders, or any other team moving into a place where only the Rams could fill.   I have felt bad for St. Louis as I know Stan is moving for profit,  not because he cares about the la fanbase,  and obvisously  caring less for the St. Louis fanbas.  He is a business man and you don't become a billionaire by caring for others.  With this said, I have had nothing but opposition being from Los Angeles.  It's an automatic ""fuck that guy""  so I have become defensive, and sometimes offensive.   To the point that it really doesn't matter.  Los Angeles is getting the Rams back either way.  I will still and always be a Rams fan."
StLouisRams,2ulim5,theflyingginger93,8,Tue Feb 3 03:33:25 2015 UTC,"Nice speculation but if he wanted to sell the Rams at a higher price, moving to LA would immediately make the Rams one of the top 5 most valuable NFL teams. So if he wanted to do that, pretending to move to LA makes no sense."
StLouisRams,2ulim5,crewdoughty,9,Tue Feb 3 04:16:20 2015 UTC,"Spanos isn't selling the Chargers. This new stadium proposal is years away from being ready to commit to. Saying that they're staying isn't crazy, saying Kroenke sells one team and buys another to move to LA is a bit absurd though."
StLouisRams,2ulim5,Dave_the_lighting_gu,5,Tue Feb 3 03:58:15 2015 UTC,"I think ""years away"" is a bit much.  They have started bringing on consultants to help plan the development, they have already bought up some of the land for the proposed location. everyone with second hand knowledge is selling the story that public funding won't be a problem...  At this point it's fairly safe to say they are moving along fairly well.  Although, everyone connected with the situation is stating they are building the stadium in an effort to keep St. Louis an ""NFL city"".  No mention of keeping the Rams.  They gone."

StLouisRams,2ulim5,Dave_the_lighting_gu,1 point,Tue Feb 3 16:17:59 2015 UTC,"In the press conference, they didn't mention the Rams one time (from what I recall, at least until asked), they merely mentioned trying to keep St. Louis an NFL city.    AFAIK everything Randy Karriker and Bernie have written/said in the last few weeks corroborates what I've written.    Since I don't have any people with direct connections to situation, I use these guys for my information.  If you have better information, please let me know."
StLouisRams,2ulim5,iamlogan,5,Tue Feb 3 17:09:54 2015 UTC,Peacock mentioned the Rams multiple times during the stadium plans reveal. Stating that the Rams belonged to the city and that they're our team.
StLouisRams,2ulim5,Dave_the_lighting_gu,-1,Tue Feb 3 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"Again, that was in response to a question to a question specifically asking about the Rams.  In their original speech, they did not mention the Rams, nor Kroenke.    They are working primarily with the NFL to get any team to play here.  Whether that means keeping the Rams or moving a team here, has yet to be seen.  I would love it if the Rams stay here, but the odds of that happening are diminishing rapidly.  Joe Buck came out and said they plan on leaving, John Clayton said the same thing.  At this point, it is a wasted effort trying to keep them beyond 2015."
StLouisRams,2ulim5,SoulardSTL,5,Tue Feb 3 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"Peacock repeatedly stated that the stadium was being built for the Rams. The presentation, however, is being positioned to the NFL more than it is to the Rams Organization, as Kroenke has his fingers in his ears and doesn't want to hear from the STL community.   The Commission has stated that it is avidly fighting to retain the Saint Louis Rams because they are the Saint Louis Rams. They also have stated that they intend for STL to remain an NFL City, just in case Kroenke goes full bastard mode and tries to go ""Baltimore Colts"" on us.   Very much, it is a valued effort to retain our team, much better than surrendering because the efforts to win are uncertain."

StLouisRams,2ulim5,Seductive_Santa,11,Tue Feb 3 03:46:28 2015 UTC,"The Raiders went to the playoffs in '93, barely missed in '94 and were gone right after that. Unfortunately on the field performance has little to nothing to do with off the field stadium politics."
StLouisRams,2ulim5,SoulardSTL,3,Tue Feb 3 04:08:17 2015 UTC,"I admire the optimism, but the writing seems to be on the wall. While there are several legit reasons why they won't move, the league won't stop him and might actually support him if the Inglewood project is everything it's cracked up to be."

StLouisRams,2uh3d8,mlasn,29,Mon Feb 2 03:09:22 2015 UTC,First thing that came to my mind was the game against Seattle (was it last year..?) where we were on the goal line but didn't run it in.
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,KickAsstley,7,Mon Feb 2 03:21:11 2015 UTC,yeap 4th and goal to win the game
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,overlordden,5,Mon Feb 2 04:42:40 2015 UTC,When I saw the formation I said to my friends : I hope it doesn't end like the rams-chargers game ....
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,5mars,26,Mon Feb 2 03:45:36 2015 UTC,The outcome of this game was going to upset me no matter what: either the Pats were getting their 4th ring or the Seahawks were going back-to-back.  What bothered me the most out of this game was that the Seahawks had THREE CHANCES to run the ball with BEAST MODE from the ONE YARD LINE and they did NOT. Run. The. Ball.
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,cariboustew28,12,Mon Feb 2 03:32:54 2015 UTC,"Don't worry we know. I don't know why I'm visiting all the NFC West subs, guess I'm some kind of masochist. Sigh"

StLouisRams,2uh3d8,diesel321,13,Mon Feb 2 04:22:17 2015 UTC,"If you look at his game last year against Seattle (the MNF game in STL) then it was arguably worse. Kellen Clemens first game, Zac Stacy has 200 yards rushing. 2 spread passes. Lynch is certainly better than Stacy, but the gap between Wilson, Lynch is definitely closer than Clemens, Stacy"
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,BrawndoTTM,4,Mon Feb 2 07:40:53 2015 UTC,"He never got the opportunity by virtue of being so garbage. If the Jets won that AFCG, there isn't a doubt in my mind he'd have made an even worse Superbowl losing blunder."

He just got 5 yards to get you on the 1 yard line. Fuck my hatred for the patriots is far more than the Seahawks. I cannot believe I'm upset by a Seahawk lost. Fuuuck both of these teams!!!!!!!! I had flash backs from our sinilar lost to the Seahawks. Still was a great game though and was happy it was insane."
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,geckoswan,5,Mon Feb 2 04:41:23 2015 UTC,I hate the patriots way more. The hawks hatred is fairly recent because they never used to be so dominant. I am still bitter about our last super bowl. ( Idk why I can't let it go) I am with you on being more pissed that the hawks lost.
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,LLv2,5,Mon Feb 2 06:27:38 2015 UTC,"It's because it was obvious they cheated, and then the league acted to cover it up.  They lost the fucking tapes?  Give me a break.  If I was made NFL commissioner I would do to the Pats what the cycling commission did to Lance Armstrong."

StLouisRams,2uh3d8,RaymonM,6,Mon Feb 2 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, the pain from our last Super Bowl was so hard to get rid of. However, eventually I got over it and so should we. It was 13 years ago and yes that could be the last time we get there, but at least many of us had the great opportunity to see us beat the Titans.   My point is that the Pats were a long time rival, but we have to let wounds heal no matter how the other team won (Spygate being an indicator that they cheated against us), we need to get over it as a fan base. It is one of the most difficult things to get over; believe me I know. As of right now the seaCOCKS are our biggest kryptonite, and we need to be treating them as such. They lost tonight and so we should treat this as a victory for our franchise. They will be losing their Defensive Coordinator, and will becoming off of a SuperBowl loss, the niners are on the down hill slide(hiring their defensive line coach as their head coach, like wtf), the Cardinals are a good team at best, we need to look at the bright side and see this a win for our team. FTS, FTF, and FTC.  LETs GO RAMS 2015 is our year and we will show it. Lets rally around Bradford and play good football!!!!!!!!!"
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,LLv2,2,Mon Feb 2 05:34:03 2015 UTC,This is how it works - it hurts until you win it all.  Then you can let it go.  Red Sox fans didn't forgive Billy Buckner until 2004.
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,RaymonM,3,Mon Feb 2 06:34:32 2015 UTC,"First of all upvote because what you are saying is true.  But we have won it all, we could be like the Cubs and never have the feeling to have won it all or the browns or any other team to not have won a championship. We have to take our wins as they come. Yes we lost and yes maybe the pats took away the chance for the GreatestShowOnTurf to have a dynasty, but we saw a SuperBowl win. We can't change the past and we can only hope for the future and with our team I am very hopeful.   We just need to keep supporting our team no matter how good or how terribly bad they are. As a fan base it is our job. I completely understand your point, but lets just persevere through this hard time (even though its been years) and keep supporting the horns through thick and thin. We can do it and when our time comes again it will just mean we deserve it more."
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,LLv2,3,Mon Feb 2 06:40:05 2015 UTC,"We're talking about disliking the Pats, not supporting the Rams.  And do you know how much of a grudge Pats fans felt toward the NY Giants?  This is in spite of winning three in four years."
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,RaymonM,3,Mon Feb 2 06:42:44 2015 UTC,"Hey man we can dislike all 31 other teams that aren't the Rams all we want. I know that Pats fans hate the Giants, like a 16-0 season and going the Superbowl against a wildcard Giants and LOSING???  But at a certain point we should move on, we only play the Patriots once every 4 years. We play the Seahawks twice a year. I would much rather be glad for a team that barely beat us in a Superbowl(that could have gone into overtime and whoever would have gotten the ball first won), than a team that prides themselves on their bandwagon fans who rep the number of the year they became fans.   Plus the SeaCOCKS spoiled the last chance we had to go to the playoffs. Fuck them."
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,geckoswan,3,Mon Feb 2 06:54:09 2015 UTC,"I find it so hard to let it go. What makes it so hard is they keep winning. If the Pats sucked for a couple years after winning, then i could let it go. You can call it jealousy, but I don't. Then you have something like deflate-gate and it just brings back all the bad memories for me. I will try though. Go Rams!"
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,RaymonM,2,Mon Feb 2 06:31:09 2015 UTC,"Oh man do I understand what you are saying. It was such a ""deflating"" loss in our last Super Bowl, but it was such a long time ago. If this Super Bowl should mean anything is that the Brady-Belichick era is a great one. We should be lucky that we will be included in history. We are currently living and seeing one of the greatest franchise/coach-player era ever. We need to look at how ""deflating"" this loss will be to the seaCOCKS and understand that they may never be the same team. This game only gives hope that the Rams can take the division and make the playoffs.   Lets try together since we are all in this together as Rams fans, and make the best of a worst Super Bowl situation. RamsNation forever!"
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,geckoswan,2,Mon Feb 2 06:47:30 2015 UTC,You're right man. I will have to let it go. Can't wait for next season!!!
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,New_DudeToo,2,Mon Feb 2 07:18:51 2015 UTC,"Hear me out. I hate Seattle. I think this play was run with the option of score first, or just throw it away. That rookie made a hell of a play. Russell forced it (thankfully). If you leave 20 seconds for Tom only needing a field goal,  who knows what happens. If you want to score immediately, Russell could have easily audibled to run. He chose not to because Pats were in goal line/man up. If you were facing 7 down linemen would you not take a shot throwing?"
StLouisRams,2uh3d8,zi76,2,Mon Feb 2 09:29:39 2015 UTC,"So, I'm a lifelong Patriots fan, although I've lived in the NY/VT area for most of my life and only some of it in Boston.  I figured that I should get that out of the way to start with.  The playcall itself, a pass to try to fake out the defense and score a TD if possible, wasn't actually bad.  However, the problem came when Lockette was the only intended target of the play and the fact that it was a slant to the middle of the field.  It's not like this was a screen or anything, where, usually, nothing can go wrong, but forcing a ball into there and hoping that no defenders get to the ball is risky.  Ultimately, it cost them the Super Bowl.  I personally expected 1-3 Lynch runs, depending on how many it took the Seahawks to get into the end zone.  In fact, I was thinking that we should've simply let him in the end zone on the original play so that we'd still have time on the clock to score a FG with.  Anyway, if the play's converted for a TD and the Seahawks win, we'll hear that it was one of the most inspired playcalls in SB history.  To the victors go the spoils."

Most of us are over a game that happened almost 15 years ago. 3 wins out of 20 games is brutal.

StLouisRams,2uh7s9,ozarkslam21,1 point,Mon Feb 2 22:13:06 2015 UTC,My only thing about Amendola... I wish it was the Rams that got him the ring. Congrats to him though.
StLouisRams,2uh7s9,Deathswitch,-7,Thu Feb 5 17:10:17 2015 UTC,Said it elsewhere out of all our players from that time Jackson is the only one I care about getting a ring. I was glad we didn't sign Amendola for the money he got from the Pats and by and large hasn't been worthy. I also don't care for players that are on the Pats by and large so no I don't think we need to show him some love.
StLouisRams,2uh7s9,m_fromm,-25,Mon Feb 2 04:03:02 2015 UTC,Fuck Amendola. I'm pissed that he has a ring with the fucking Patriots. Traitor asshole.
StLouisRams,2uh7s9,bwc_28,18,Mon Feb 2 04:02:07 2015 UTC,"Wow salty fans are salty. We weren't going anywhere anytime soon and the dude had a chance to get on a team that competes and make some money, I don't blame him for a second."
StLouisRams,2uh7s9,DeniseDeNephew,-5,Mon Feb 2 04:07:26 2015 UTC,"and make some money, I don't blame him for a second   How far does this attitude extend?  Kroenke will make more money in LA but so many fans say they will abandon the entire team if they move,  Why show any loyalty to a single player who didn't show any to us?  I was pissed when Amendola left and I still am."
StLouisRams,2uh7s9,DeniseDeNephew,7,Mon Feb 2 04:56:20 2015 UTC,I will stay a Rams fan regardless of where they move. Why were you upset that he left? What incentive did he have to stay? What incentive did the rams give him? I expect players in the NFL to try to go where they have the best chance of winning and guess what he did that and he won.
StLouisRams,2uh7s9,LLv2,0,Mon Feb 2 06:00:09 2015 UTC,"I was upset that he left because he and Jackson represented a huge percentage of our offensive production and both left.  We have arguably replaced both but that took time and came at a cost.  Is Tavon the new Amendola for us?  What if Amendola had stayed, who else could we have gotten with the picks it took to move up and then take Tavon?   It's for reasons like this that my ""good for him!"" feelings aren't as strong as they are for many other fans.  Maybe I should blame Snead and Fisher but I don't know what happened behind closed doors so all I can go by is what I saw:  Amendola signed with the Patriots almost immediately after Welker left.  From that perspective it looks like he wanted to leave regardless of whatever Snead and Fisher had to offer.    I really wanted Amendola to stay (even with his injury history) but I agree that the bigger incentive for him was to leave.  All we could realistically offer was money while NE could offer money AND a likely annual playoff run and a much better shot at a ring, but as a fan this is exactly what I hate about free agency.  The top teams are more attractive to FAs so they tend to get a constant influx of good proven talent while the lower teams, like ours, have to either overspend to get a top FA or are stuck signing lesser players.  It's great for guys like Amendola who can fill a role on a strong team but it's bad for us.  And don't get me wrong, I don't hate the man.  If I saw him in a restaurant I wouldn't sneer at him or give him the stink-eye, in fact I'd probably turn into a giggly fangirl and ask for his autograph, but rooting for him?  I don't root for Bradley Fletcher or any of the other ex-Rams who are sprinkled throughout the league even though I ""know"" those players.   I'm with you in that I will stay loyal to this team and it's players regardless of where they play but I lose my loyalty for players who choose to leave.  Maybe your way is better but when I see an ex-Ram doing well somewhere else it only hurts more that they left.  This team has struggled to become competitive again and every good player who leaves is a step backwards for us even if it is a step forward for them."
StLouisRams,2uh7s9,bwc_28,5,Mon Feb 2 10:32:07 2015 UTC,Amendola isn't the entire team.
StLouisRams,2uh7s9,crewdoughty,-19,Mon Feb 2 18:19:07 2015 UTC,"We offered him money to stay with the team that gave him his shot. Fuck him. Any  Rams fan ok with the Pats winning a Super Bowl obviously hasn't been a fan for very long, so I won't take your opinion seriously."

StLouisRams,2u3o4e,MathBeaudet,4,Thu Jan 29 19:07:24 2015 UTC,He made Marshawn look like a ragdoll!
StLouisRams,2u3o4e,G1NGER,7,Thu Jan 29 22:57:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for putting these together! Not sure he is a lock with Mack in the conversation, but he is one helluva DT. He'll be a Ram for a long, long time."
StLouisRams,2u3o4e,The_Wayward,3,Thu Jan 29 17:57:31 2015 UTC,I think the stats will win it for Donald. A rookie DT with 19 tackles for a loss and 9 sacks! That is craziness. Here's Mack for a comparison.  #5 Khalil Mack - Tackles 76 - TFL 16 - Sacks 4 - Int 0- FF 1    vs NE 1 vs NE 2 vs BUF BUF sack vs HOU SD sack vs CLE 1 vs CLE 2
StLouisRams,2u3o4e,DeniseDeNephew,2,Thu Jan 29 18:00:44 2015 UTC,These are great.  His dominant season was probably the highlight of the year for me as a Rams fan.   It's especially impressive when you see him blow through an O-line as if it isn't there.  I'm not one of the people who wanted him in the draft (or one of the ones who makes that claim with the benefit of hindsight) but I couldn't be happier that we got him.
StLouisRams,2u2vx2,KurtanionNZ,9,Thu Jan 29 13:54:44 2015 UTC,He realizes Sam is elite.

StLouisRams,2u34ja,ismizz,10,Thu Jan 29 15:16:45 2015 UTC,"By in-house, they're being very literal. The Rams position coaches don't want the job either, so Jeff Fisher's wife looks primed to take over the position. She's not as big a fan of Sam as Jeff is, so it looks like there might be some infighting in Rams Park as well as the Fisher homestead."
StLouisRams,2u34ja,wowbagger88,6,Thu Jan 29 21:43:35 2015 UTC,"So the front runners are Boras and Cignetti, two guys who spent a couple years under Schotty.  At any time Snead and Fisher could have fired Schotty and promoted either one but we stayed with Schotty -- was that just blind loyalty or did they think Schotty was the best of the three to be OC?  Either this offense was being held down by allowing a poor OC to take the reins for 3 years out of loyalty or else Schotty's replacement will be someone that our coach and GM think is less qualified than he was.  This is grim.  The article mentions Schwartz and Williams as successful promotions by Fisher, let's hope Boras or Cignetti is another.    By the way, if this was the plan all along then why is it taking such a long time?  The press release will spin it as a proud day in Rams history when a position coach got a long-overdue promotion but all the circumstances point to an uncertain, confused, and increasingly desperate hiring.   Boras and Cignetti don't seem like top-tier talent like Gase or Trestman, they seem like the last two kids left when people are choosing teams, the people you only take because you have to not because you want to.    This is looking like such a missed opportunity.  The pieces for at least a middle of the pack offense are there, especially with Bradford and Quick back and the possible addition of Foles, but who will put those pieces together?  Is it reasonable to think that Boras was loaded with creative ways to use Tavon but kept them to himself, or that Schotty and Fisher heard his excellent suggestions but chose to ignore them?  I don't think it is.  I think it's much more reasonable to think that he didn't have any better ideas than Schotty had.  So why would anyone think that a Schotty subordinate will do a better job than he did?  Is game-day play calling going to make all the difference?  I'll wait and see like everyone else but so far this whole process seems botched.   Where are you, Gordo?   Give this hiring an F."
StLouisRams,2u34ja,DeniseDeNephew,5,Fri Jan 30 06:06:06 2015 UTC,I'm with you.  So disappointed.
StLouisRams,2u34ja,helpimnaked,3,Fri Jan 30 11:52:53 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day it doesn't matter who our OC is. If you thought we'd bring in someone like Trestman or Shanny, you were bound to be disappointed. Fisher knows exactly what kind of offense he wants to run, and the OC wasn't going to change that. At the end of the day his team is always going to be one that wins with good defense and a dominating run game. The only real difference we might see here is better play calling, which I believe Fisher leaves up to his OC, and less 'trick' packages that run Tavon up the middle or Cook on a jet sweep."
StLouisRams,2u34ja,sir_nigel_loring,6,Fri Jan 30 19:19:35 2015 UTC,Shaun Hill?

StLouisRams,2u3b0y,helpimnaked,44,Thu Jan 29 16:09:16 2015 UTC,Does St. Louis have a QB controversy?
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,ozarkslam21,8,Thu Jan 29 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"Technically we don't right now, but coach Fish said that definitely there will be a competition for the starting job either by a free agent signing/trade or by a QB they get in the draft"
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,09-11-2001,7,Thu Jan 29 17:56:42 2015 UTC,No. Clearly Kellen Clemens is the sure starter with Desperado Davis sitting behind him at #2.
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,Sergeant_America,11,Thu Jan 29 23:16:49 2015 UTC,"Jeff has said a few times that Sam is his guy. As of right now, he is the only starting-caliber QB that we have. Shaun Hill is a capable QB, but we won't win any division titles with him at the helm. As of right now, there is no QB controversy in St. Louis."
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,loismustdie1,5,Thu Jan 29 16:38:58 2015 UTC,This is a sad truth.  I understand wanting to give Sam another chance but I'm going to need some convincing.  He's fragile and I don't think he can physically last a whole season.  If/when he gets injured again we NEED a plan B and Hill just isn't it.
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,REDUCE5231,5,Thu Jan 29 21:00:11 2015 UTC,We dont even have a QB

StLouisRams,2u3b0y,Schamwise,4,Fri Jan 30 03:47:40 2015 UTC,"If we traded for Foles, I would be more than happy to see a QB controversy. However, apart from Jameis or Mariota, I think it would be in our best interest to let whatever QB we draft learn the ropes behind Bradford for a little bit."
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,Ihateunerds,2,Fri Jan 30 00:02:13 2015 UTC,"Even if we could draft MM or JW I would rather bench them for 1 or 2 years. Rookie QBs are sketchy no matter what. I think Sam Bradford is a great example of someone who should have sat the bench a bit before starting. I'm no athlete but it seems like technical ability is about half of the QB equation. If you cant effectively read the different defensive styles from around the league, and you dont have an all star O-line, you'll get hit a lot.   But we wont draft either of them so who cares."
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,Schamwise,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:29:36 2015 UTC,Ummm...no he's not. Bradfords rookie season was his best one.

StLouisRams,2u3b0y,Schamwise,2,Sun Feb 1 04:39:13 2015 UTC,"Oh ok. It was having a good rookie season that ruined him. I had always thought it might have been due to injuries, inferior coaching and personnel."

I think we can all agree that injuries aren't purely a matter of bad luck. There is a reason that some QBs get hit more than others.  Obviously coaching is a huge part, but so is player experience. Most of my favorite QBs didn't play their rookie season but that's just an opinion."
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,Schamwise,1 point,Tue Feb 3 03:31:17 2015 UTC,"I can only think of 2 successful QBs this era that went that route, Rodgers and Kaepernick.

StLouisRams,2u3b0y,bwc_28,2,Fri Jan 30 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"I've heard up to a year but that was talking about ACL injuries in general, not specifically about Bradford.  The assumption is that he'll be ready for training camp later this year so until we hear otherwise we might as well assume that's the timetable.  Speaking of ACL injuries, I tracked down an old article from 2010 called Torn ACL Success Stories which includes a Top 10 list of ""players who have come back 100% after an ACL tear"" that might give us all some hope.  If nothing else it's something to read besides Deflategate or Marshawn Lynch stories.  Here's the list.    RB Jamal Lewis: Torn ACL in 2001. Bounced back in 2002 to rush for 1327 yards with a 4.3 avg. Then in 2003 rushed for 2066 yards with a 5.3 avg. WR Jerry Rice: Torn ACL in 1997. Returned in 1998 and had 82 receptions for 1157 yards at 34  years old. Had two more 1100+ yard seasons in 2001 and 2002. ILB Nick Barnett: Torn ACL in 2008. Came back in 2009 and racked up 105 tackles, 4 sacks, and 7 passes defended.  QB Tom Brady: Torn ACL in 2008. Returned in 2009 and passed for 4398 yards with a 65.7 comp pct and 7.8 avg. SS Roman Harper: Torn ACL rookie year in 2006. Rebounded following year in 2007 with 90 tackles, 4 sacks, 8 passes defended and 3 INT. Just recently had 102 tackles in 2009.  RB Edgerrin James: Torn ACL in 2001. Following year in 2002, rushed for 989 in 14 games. In 2003, rushed for 1289 yards, then had back to back 1500+ yard seasons in '04 and '05.  WR Braylon Edwards: Torn ACL rookie year in 2005. Solid year in 2006 with 61 catches and 884 yards. Pro bowler in 2007 with 80 catches for 1289 yards.  RB Willis Mcgahee: Torn ACL in the bowl game before being drafted. Missed entire rookie season in 2003 and bounced back next season with 1128 yards rushing with a 4.0 ypc.  RB Frank Gore: Tore his left ACL in 2001 while in college. Rehabbed all of 2002, returned in 2003 only to tear his right ACL. Returned following year after switching jersey numbers and rushed for 1000+ yards in his last college year. In his rookie year in 2005, as a part timer, rushed for 608 yards with a 4.8 ypc. Following year in 2006, rushed for 1695 yards with a 5.4 ypc. QB Donovan Mcnabb: Torn ACL in Week 11 of 2006 season. Returned following season and in 14 games passed for 3324 yards, 61.5 comp. pct and 7.0 avg.    *Honorable Mention: RB Correll Buckhalter: Two torn ACLs in his career. Recently rushed for 642 yards with a 5.4 average in 7 starts with Denver.    And maybe medical science has made some strides in the 5 years since this list was compiled so who knows, maybe we'll get the old Sam back, and maybe his injuries will all be a thing of the past.  That's a lot of maybes.  Not to be a Debbie Downer but so much of this franchise's near future hinges on that guy -- if he never returns to form and Snead/Fisher fail to find a solid replacement then the bubble could burst for this team as age and free agency break them up before they ever make a SB run."
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,CyanRam,1 point,Fri Jan 30 13:30:59 2015 UTC,"A second tear to the same knee is much more difficult to come back from though. Bradford's knee will never be the same. That's not to say he won't be good, but it's impossible at this point for his knee to ever get back to even 95% of what it was before he first injured it. Each consecutive tear makes it progressively worse."
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,DiscoJer,2,Fri Jan 30 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"I believe most of us here in this subreddit have an unhealthy love for Sam Bradford. We all want him to be the guy, but it's getting to the point where we'll soon have to keep him or cut him."
StLouisRams,2u3b0y,JKaye57,3,Fri Jan 30 16:08:33 2015 UTC,"Well, in the sense that we don't have any viable options, yes.  I mean, the choices is between one of the highest paid players in football who hasn't actually played football in a couple years and wasn't particularly good when he played (average at best), an old journeyman back up who isn't very good, and a young guy who sometimes outplayed that old journeyman, but mostly didn't.  Bradford will probably be back, simply because I think the Rams plan on tanking in 2015 so as to justify the move, and to get a fresh start with a high draft pick in LA that will build excitement.   Same reason the Rams haven't gotten a OC yet - they'll go with no one for a year, then next year when they move, try to get a real one."

We've missed out on anyone from a top NFL offense, so if the choice is between a position coach from a mediocre offense (like our own TE coach) and someone from the college ranks I'd prefer... well neither really but there's nobody on the staff on the offensive side who has earned a shot at OC, imo.    I was so happy to see Schotty go but the search for his replacement has been agonizing.  All the exciting candidates have gone elsewhere or been denied the chance to move and it looks more and more like we're going to end up with just a warm body who was chosen out of desperation instead of someone who has been on Snead and Fisher's wish list for a long time.    Wasn't there a year when we were one of the few (the only?) team to not have a QB coach?  I'm joking when I say that it looks like we'll make that same mistake by not having an OC, but just barely.  They should have had a list of names months ago and they should have moved quickly.  At this point I don't have any faith that we're going to see a turnaround on offense in 2015.  I hope I'm wrong."

StLouisRams,2tz2f6,TheDuke13,9,Wed Jan 28 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"I look at it this way:  Right or Wrong.  Fair or Unfair St.  Louis signed a lease that put us in this position.  If the city had put a normal 30 year lease on the table we wouldn't be talking about this for another 10 years.  The original bonds would be paid off and we could investigate renovation or a new stadium with no debt hanging over the previous project.  Unfortunately the city did sign the lease with an out after 20 years.  The Rams are on the brink of leaving and we have to decide if we're in or out on the NFL.  The Rams may leave for LA no matter what but if Saint Louis and the surrounding counties want NFL football in the area at all we will need a new stadium.  It sucks but thems the fact.  No stadium, no NFL."
StLouisRams,2tz2f6,D33GS,15,Wed Jan 28 18:56:54 2015 UTC,I hate to say but I think they are gone. The writing is on the wall the NFL wants them in LA the owner wants them there and the tax payers don't give a shit

StLouisRams,2tz2f6,DabDastic,6,Wed Jan 28 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"Like LA 20 years ago, St. Louis may find out the harsh reality of standing up to the NFL machine of extorting tax dollars. It's a shameful and shitty process that ends in heartbreak for so many."
StLouisRams,2tz2f6,Seductive_Santa,11,Wed Jan 28 17:20:07 2015 UTC,"This is highly questionable.   Missouri Alliance for Freedom is one guy in Jeff City with an agenda, trying to make a name for himself (no other staffers listed, nor a Board of Directors). Remington Research Group is a small, reputable Kansas City-based outfit that conducted MAF's survey on the stadium.   This survey was conducted by Robocalls, meaning people who still have phone lines and who are not on a do-not-call list. I've worked in political campaigns with a robocalling campaign component and can tell you that this means really old people were the ones questioned. Young people use cell phones that robocalls rarely call because they’re not listed in phone books. Middle-aged people and plenty of older ones usually have their phones registered on do-not-call lists, and many robocall programs will bypass these names because they’ll not answer.   What is not stated is whether ANY of those polled really live in STL. Are these potential voters in the STL City? In STL County? From the STL Metro Area, which includes Lincoln, Warren, Franklin, and St. Francois Counties? For all we know, this could be a population base from the furthest reaches of the STL Metropolitan Statistical Area, potentially a good hour by highway from I-270. We have absolutely no way of knowing if ANY of those polled live in either STL City or County.   And honestly, a polled sample of 776 likely voters is nothing, especially if we have no idea where these people live. We can assume that 10,000 were called and that 9,224 hung up.   Now, Ryan Johnson is the one guy at MAF. He had Remington conduct the robocall survey. Robocall campaigns aren't cheap. Remington has clients (political campaigns & candidates) across the US; they are certainly not cheap.   Are we to assume Ryan Johnson and MAF paid for this whole thing out of personal interest or curiosity? Or more likely, who put up the money for MAF to have this poll conducted? Are we looking at out-state politicians trying to stick it to Governor Nixon over economic partisan ideologies? For all we know, it could be a Kroenke-supported poll to make STL look bad. We simply don't know enough from this little data blurb.  It was journalistically irresponsible for KMOV to publish this poll without context."
StLouisRams,2tz2f6,SoulardSTL,3,Wed Jan 28 19:24:15 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit of a stretch to call this journalism irresponsibility. The article even poses the question of the timing and the opinions reached of the poll, but the questions asked were presented in a non-partisan way."
StLouisRams,2tz2f6,Orbitmint,3,Thu Jan 29 01:33:59 2015 UTC,A sample of 776 is way more than enough to say is statistically meaningful supposing its random sampling.

Incredible disparities in demographic populaces here."

I've lived in California my entire life, and the general LA area for the last 5 years. I'm very biased but a large amount of sports fans in LA are unbearable. Every team has terrible fans. Even as a St. Louis Cardinals fan I know that we have annoying and pompous fans. LA is different. There is something about their fans that rubs everyone the wrong way. I don't know if it's entitlement or a great amount of success from their teams, but it is unreal how rude and awful they can be.  They're like the Richard Sherman of fan bases. It's like, ""wow, they're one of the best, but they also never shut the hell up."""

Obviously every fan base has awful fans, but I really do think it varies based off of the team's area and a few other factors. At the same time I feel like each fan base have different flaws/tendencies.  For example, I feel like bay area fans have a tendency to bandwagon and can be fair weather. On the other hand they also have some very loyal passionate fans through and through. Boston area fans seem to be very knowledgable and intelligent but act like the sky is falling when their team struggles for a game. As a fan of mostly St. Louis teams I feel like I can speak for most of us when I say we are very loyal and fair, but have been spoiled by the Cards success recently and overreact easily.  Probably didn't need that much explanation, but you get the picture."

Then we'd try to package our #10, next year's round 1 and probably a second rounder to TB in order to move up for MM. However, I really can't see the Eagles doing this. We have so many holes to fill elsewhere to give up multiple first round picks."
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,BrawndoTTM,17,Wed Jan 28 15:24:52 2015 UTC,"I really like Foles, but I'm scared of how much we're going to overpay for him. We need that first rounder for our OL."

StLouisRams,2tq7c5,DreamOfTheRood,-6,Mon Jan 26 18:00:34 2015 UTC,Philly is going to trade a qb to Stl for their first-round pick.  Philly will then trade their two first-round picks to TB so they can get Mariota.
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,helpimnaked,15,Mon Jan 26 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"We are not trading a #10 overall pick for a player. Just won't happen. Alex Smith went for a second round, and he's much more proven than Foles."
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,bozo7337,6,Mon Jan 26 18:34:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I could almost see Foles being enough to swap firsts, almost. But no way in hell he is worth #10."
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,helpimnaked,2,Mon Jan 26 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"If we swapped firsts and we got Foles, I'd be happy. More than likely it would take swapping first and a third rounder for Foles, though."
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,bozo7337,7,Mon Jan 26 18:41:32 2015 UTC,Last year it took a 3rd round pick to move up from 27 to 20. Seven picks and only moving up to 20 but it took a 3rd rounder. You think moving up to #10 from #20 would require us to give up a 3rd? Acquiring Foles in this scenario is basically us dropping 10 spots in the first and 2 3rd round picks. No thank you.
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,helpimnaked,1 point,Mon Jan 26 19:00:07 2015 UTC,"Here's what I mean  Rams Give: 1st round (no 10 overall) & 3rd Round picks  Eagles Give: 1st round (no 20), Foles  So basically we swap firsts and give a third to acquire Foles. Sorry if I'm misunderstanding you or not being clear, I've got a fever today and am very absent minded. I personally think that would be enough to get it done and is a fair deal for both sides. Potentially, it could be more like a 2016 late round conditional pick rather than  a 2015 3rd round."
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,bozo7337,3,Mon Jan 26 19:10:24 2015 UTC,I get what you're saying. I personally don't think Foles is worth dropping back to #20 and giving up a 3rd rounder. If you take Foles out of the equation Philly would have to give us at least a 3rd to move up to #10. I also don't think it's realistic for the Rams to be in the Foles sweepstakes as the Eagles would have to jump ahead of the Jets to get Mariota.

Fuck I say trade the tenth pick for a gunslinger quarterback who would give us a shot at least, cut Bradford, sign Maclin and let's have one last fun year of Rams football in St Louis.  We can draft a right tackle in the 2nd.  You don't take O Line at ten overall unless it's a LT.  Certainly not an interior lineman.  Trading out of the first also opens up more cap space as your not going to be paying a rookie $3 million a year.  Foles cap hit is 600,000 next year.

StLouisRams,2tq7c5,cariboustew28,3,Tue Jan 27 00:06:33 2015 UTC,If you get Foles you have to cut Sam and that contract loose.
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,Bmallar1,2,Mon Jan 26 22:48:02 2015 UTC,"My assumption was that's what they'd do. I'd think the cap hit (even with a greatly reduced contract by Sam) would be too much to keep them both, but who knows..."
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,helpimnaked,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"You don't HAVE to, but they should. Foles only makes 600k. But he's the better quarterback. If we trade our first rounder and cut Bradford that would open up about 16 million in cap space. Imagine the possibilities."
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,whyunoname,8,Tue Jan 27 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"Weren't we always rumoured to get like every QB that's ever been available in the last 3 years? Favre, Tebow, Quinn, Sanchez, Vince Young... I'm going to remain skeptical until this actually happens."
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,Seductive_Santa,4,Mon Jan 26 19:27:29 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Kelly would want enough in return to make a move up in the draft to Mariota
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,surferkwc,3,Mon Jan 26 16:03:56 2015 UTC,"That would never ever happen. If we were giving up enough to move up in the draft, we'd do it ourselves and take Mariota or Winston. Foles is not a scheme fit in Philly and they'd like to get some value out of him."
StLouisRams,2tq7c5,bdubbz14,4,Mon Jan 26 17:58:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly it would be a steal for both teams.  I personally think there are some trades that both teams win and this is one of them.  Foles has the skill and talent and most of us love him.  I think Chip wants his guy; a guy that can run a non-traditional offense in the NFL.  Basically he wants a mobile, read option QB.  I think Foles skill is somewhere between his 13 and 14 season, and would compare him to a young Roethlisberger.  I'm guessing the bounty would be something like:   Swap first round Swap second round 3rd round pick.   I think 2 and three may be interchangeable or some variation.  Fair price for a you pro bowl QB with a huge upside that doesn't fit our system.  I'd actually prefer to keep him and draft secondary but if they need ""their guy"" then go get him..."

StLouisRams,2tq7c5,TweetPoster,3,Mon Jan 26 21:26:43 2015 UTC,Every fan base over values their players and under values other teams players. It also doesn't hepl that we played vs Foles and the Eagles this year. Foles didn't have his best game against us and is coming off an injury. Either way I don't think the Rams are in play for Foles or a trade with Philly. If they want Mariota they need to jump higher than 10.

If they cheat against a team they have rolled every time they faced them the past few years its not a huge stretch to believe they would of done it other games like maybe the one against the Ravens which was much closer. Also the outcome shouldn't really mean much, if a player used a cork bat but gets out should he not be punished? Either way fuck the Pats."

StLouisRams,2tvfw9,big_fig,0,Sat Jan 31 22:27:03 2015 UTC,"Just wondering.  Did the football prepper do as Kraft said? Did he rub all the footballs so hard it raised their temperature?  How was it carried out.  Did he rub all the footballs first and then measure their pressures one after the other.  Do you really think they would hold the temperature for that long as each was subsequently rubbed?  How was it that each was prepped to be exactly 2 psi less than allowable?  Or did he rub one at a time really hard, then measure the temp then rub another, etc. This doesn't make sense either.  We're to believe the prepper picked a ball up,  picked up the rubbing material,  rubbed the ball, put the material down and picked up a gauge to measure a ball?  Seems like a bunch of redundant picking up and putting down.  Something doesn't make sense.  What did they rub the footballs with to raise their temperature?  Why didn't any of the sports reporters asked these questions?  Has anyone done a Mythbusters;  Yes it does matter, because the Patriots have a suspicious record of not fumbling underinflated balls at their home stadium.  How did this help them beat other teams?  Would they even have had home field advantage?  Yes it does matter!    As if there isn't enough reasons to hate Boston."
StLouisRams,2tvfw9,bigdumbanimal,2,Tue Jan 27 21:58:08 2015 UTC,"They probably use power sanders like Eli uses for his footballs. That's just an assumption though.  I'm also curious why Aaron Rodgers would come out and say he tries to sneak overinflated footballs past the officials. If the refs are actually measuring the PSI before every game, wouldn't that mean he'd never get a ball inflated the way he likes it?  It's almost as if the refs aren't doing their job and measuring the footballs at all, like they just pick up a couple, glance at the ba, and then send the ball boy on his way."
StLouisRams,2tvfw9,zaviex,1 point,Tue Jan 27 22:37:17 2015 UTC,They don't have a suspicious record of not fumbling.  They just do far better at recovering the fumbled balls.
StLouisRams,2tvfw9,Opifex,0,Thu Jan 29 22:09:35 2015 UTC,Answer the fucking question.  How were the footballs filled?   How is it that every football player on national TV can immediately tell the difference between normal and 2 psi under-inflated footballs.   The TRUTH is that Tom Brady has tiny hands like the guy in that hamburger commercial and needs to cheat.  Tiny Hands Brady.  That's what you get when I get home from work and have a couple Hop Hunter Sierra Nevada IPAs.  Fuck Tiny Hands Brady!

Rams fans have felt for 20 years what you're feeling right now. Anger at an owner who is intent on moving the team they love. The stripper moved the team from LA to St Louis after running it into the ground in LA for years after killing her husband /allegedly. Just because they would like the team they've cheered on for decades doesn't mean they hate you quit being so damned hyper sensitive. People like the guy who wrote this article/blog, people like Bernie people who come in here talking shit and down voting people just because they would like the team in LA are the ones that cause all these problems. LA fans aren't the problem here and neither are St Louis fans.

Up until the mid 70s the Rams were always at the top of league attendance figures. Once new stadiums and teams began emerging they slipped, and moving to a much smaller stadium in Anaheim didn't help. Of their 50 years in So Cal, eleven seasons were below the league average in attendance. The majority of those seasons were when they moved to Anaheim, LA overwhelmingly supported the team. Btw over a third of Rams seasons in St Louis have the team below the league average in attendance. Your blind hate is leading to you either ignoring or dismissing the facts."

If say the Rams move there, then any part of that LA chunk would undeniably fall to the Rams. It's all about getting a bigger slice of that pie.

I can see why Britt or any player would prefer the options that UFA gives them but what do the Rams gain by waiting?  Or is he still technically not yet a free agent?  Why didn't send the ""we want you back"" message to him back around Thanksgiving?  Britt is not as important to this team as someone like Robert Quinn but still. why wait?"
StLouisRams,2td9qu,xKeyNin,2,Fri Jan 23 10:31:44 2015 UTC,"Possibly because he has a history of attitude problems and you never know when those can act up. And he wasn't lighting anyone up, he was just good."
StLouisRams,2td9qu,NewBroPewPew,3,Fri Jan 23 13:58:59 2015 UTC,Well he caught a few deep passes. More importantly it was about twice a game he got past the defense and would have had a loooooong TD had our QB's not consistently over or under threw him.

It was the best game I have ever seen from a Rams QB since maybe Warner.  That is why I will continue to Rock the AD Flair."

StLouisRams,2tbag5,5mars,9,Thu Jan 22 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"here is a buffalo bills post on reddit discussing Hackett and the Bills' offensive woes this season.   From all the comments it sounds an AWFUL lot like the same shit we just went through the past 3 seasons. Not utilising the run game efficiently, check down dink and dunk passes, ""no o line so can we really blame the play calling?"" ...sounds really fucking familiar to me.   I don't like this.  EDIT: From one of the Bills fans: ""I agree. I think all the Marrone / Hackett criticism is a bit overblown. Most of their playcalling reflected the fact that they needed to mask a (very) poor offensive line and quarterback.""   Jesus Christ does that not sound familiar to anyone here? This is only confirming my belief that we are not going to progress AT ALL next season unless we fix our offensive line problems.   Any which way I look at it, our shitty record comes back to our O line. We didn't like Schotty's play calling...well it worked when the O line worked (which was rare and against abysmal defenses, for reference please see our blowout games). We didn't like Clemens, Davis, Hill, (and most of us) didn't even like Bradford when he was playing...all of these QBs could have done much better if they had more than 1.5 seconds to throw a ball. We all went on hypetrains for each of those QBs when they had spurts of luck/success but the majority of the seasons these past few years have been filled with complaints, and rightfully so. But I contest that their woes were due to pass blocking. We don't run the ball enough...again if our O line made some holes our awesome running backs (and I think everyone can agree they are awesome) would be more dominant. The only thing our team has going for us is our special teams play, our defense (most of the time), and our WRs/TEs don't drop the ball anymore (Bradford got the fucking double whammy most of his career, the O line sucked AND our WRs had heads up their asses when he was on target).   TL;DR: Our offense isn't going to do shit under ANY system next year until we fix our line problems. This is all just my opinion. What are your thoughts?"

That clause hurts because of unprecedented amount of stadium construction that has occurred over the last 20 years  9). I don't see how having a historic franchise like the cardinals is bad for the other teams. Even in the worst of times, the cards (and the Rams and the blues) still draw. The biggest conflict with this is when the cards are playing meaningful baseball and the other show in town is the ""same old sorry ass Rams...""  8)  I highly doubt that the Rams moving back 100% keeps the Chargers in SD. They've been fighting for a new stadium out there for over a decade and losing that market share would hurt them tremendously. If they do move back, watching Stan have to share would be my only solace. Also the nfl has stated on many occasions that they view LA as a two team market  7)  #2 TV market in the US > #20... Can't argue that  6)  Conjecture... He also owns a ton of STL and many other cities... Toss in his marriage to a Walton of Walmart and there's not much he and his relatives don't own.   5)  That's more ""why LA needs the NfL"" than ""the Rams need to move to LA""  4)  See number 5  3)  Reads as LA= Rams Super Bowl...  Laughable  2) Same point as #7  1)  And they have a history in stl... And Anaheim...and Cleveland.

It's the willingness - the eagerness - to do any sneaky, scummy, underhanded thing possible to gain an advantage. That's the Patriots' MO, the foundation on which their dynasty is built.        I don't care that we're in the same division as Seattle; I hope the Seahawks crush those cheating fucks."

It's definitely cheating now with PSIgate, and I'm wondering how many games they've played with altered inflation."

A couple different people ""close to the investigation"" said that's what the Super Bowl tape contained. I dunno if you believe that, but I wouldn't put it past Belichick."
StLouisRams,2t6utl,JimboLodisC,5,Thu Jan 22 00:28:58 2015 UTC,"I mean if we're going on words, Belichick said he never taped a walkthrough in his life, nor has he ordered anyone else to do so for him.

The newspaper said that while they believed their source to be credible, they never viewed a videotape of the walkthrough, or talked to anyone that had. Thus, they wrote, they should not have published the story, which they deemed to be false, ""in the absence of firmer verification.""

StLouisRams,2t6utl,crackalac,4,Wed Jan 21 22:14:31 2015 UTC,I'm sure that's the only time a team has ever gotten away with defensive holding in the history of the game. We surely don't see it at all in today's game!

StLouisRams,2t85c7,KingSam2008,4,Wed Jan 21 23:22:48 2015 UTC,The NFL puts restrictions on how often a team can change their uniforms. Demhoff had said during training camp this year that the Rams were working through the uniform change process but it wasn't completed. He also wouldn't confirm what the new Uni's would be but hinted they would be the old blue and yellow like in the header.

StLouisRams,2t85c7,I_am_THE_GRAPIST,2,Thu Jan 22 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"That guy ""from Nike"" was lying. The reason we know the uniforms are changing is because Demhoff said we should be getting new uniforms soon.

I'm all for them once or twice a year as a change of pace, but dear god, I don't get everyone's obsession with them. We look like fuckin crayons out there. While I really love the current uniforms, I can see why people want a change, as the colors are a bit bland. Somewhere in between the two colors maybe, since the old ones are too bright and the current ones seem a bit bland. Maybe a slight tweak to the pattern on the jerseys? Keep the horns of course."
StLouisRams,2t85c7,To3z,7,Wed Jan 21 23:23:59 2015 UTC,"You do realize our throwbacks are the greatest uniform in NFL history, right? Maybe it's me being an old homer, but seriously, they are the greatest uniforms of all time."

Honestly, I think this whole ball deflation thing is horseshit too. I hate the Pats because we lost a game that would have been our second Lombardi and made us a kind of dynasty. Football reasons.

StLouisRams,2t80ko,price-iz-right,4,Wed Jan 21 23:00:51 2015 UTC,"Patriots fucked us during a superbowl match up.  Important things you need to know as a Rams fan today:   The media ignores us, don't take it personally Our record for the past 3 years (especially this year) and how we play are completly ass backwards. We are much better than the numbers we always seem to see at the end of the year. Our defense is the tits, especially our defensive line Our offense is like meth, sometimes you'll get a really amazing high when it clicks, but for the most part it is bad for your health. You will be drinking/smoking/and cussing with the rest of us in no time Fuck the 49ers, Fuck the Seahawks, the Cardinals are cool though. Always fuck the Patriots, that will never go away, seriously fuck the Patriots. There is an even split in fans whether Bradford is our chosen one or a drag on the team, wait until he plays next year and you be the judge. Our offensive line fucking sucks, and therefore our QBs tend to suck We don't use Tavon enough (or so this sub thinks) Prepare yourself for penalties for stupid shit, penalties for invisible shit, and penalties when we are in the position to win. This team likes to shoot itself in the foot with penalties. It also likes to get rowdy for no damn reason, there are at least one or two fights every season. Try to have fun...expect the worst and hope for the best. We got some really good games and plays out there, but this is a team and a fanbase that has been in the gutter for 10+ years. We are wary of hope, it gets us emotionally involved and then we get pissed when we lose."
StLouisRams,2t80ko,price-iz-right,1 point,Thu Jan 22 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, that's some good stuff to know. Do we have any special chants or hashtags or other stuff uniquely Rams-y?"
StLouisRams,2t80ko,PRE_-CISION-_,1 point,Fri Jan 23 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"It's been a long time since I've been in the dome, last time I saw a Rams game in persone we chanted ""BRUUUUUUUUUUUUCE"" every time Isaac Bruce caught a ball.   Not sure on hashtags either other than #stacedgod, #thankyoustacedgod for Zac Stacy (He is one of our RBs). However, we have moved on to Tre Mason as our primary back.  Since the Rams are notorious for shooting themselves in the foot, costing us plenty of games each season, we have typical sayings such as ""Classic Rams"" and ""ramming it up"" when we fumble on the 2, get unsportsmanlike conduct when in the redzone etc. Trust me you will witness this next year, we tend to do it every year. Some fans of other teams call us a ""trap team"" or our games ""trap games"" because we win games we ""shouldn't"" (because the team we are playing is considered top tier) and lose games we ""should"" win (against teams we should statistically wipe the floor with). It is the most irritating part of being a Rams fan, in my opinion. You never fucking know which team is going to show up on Sunday.  Key players that you'll want to watch are:  QB Sam Bradford  RB Tre Mason  RB Benny Cunningham  RB Zac Stacy  LT/LG Greg Robinson  WR Kenny Britt  WR Brian Quick  WR Stedman ""STUDMAN"" Bailey  WR Tavon Austin (dude is fast as fuck and makes plays out of nothing, he's my favorite at the moment hence my flair)  TE Corey Harkey  TE Jared Cook  Defense:  DT Aaron Donald (rookie but an absolute monster  DE Robert ""Black Lightning"" Quinn  DE Chris ""White Thunder"" Long  LB James ""JL55"" Laurinitis  CB Janoris ""Gets burned sometimes, but sometimes gets pick 6s"" Jenkins  CB EJ Gaines (also a rookie but shaping up to be a great corner!)  The famous ""McSafeties""...  S TJ McDonald  S Rodney McLeod  SS Mark Barron (picked him up this year from the Bucs and he is great for big hits)  Quick Edit: We are a very friendly community, and are somewhat the red headed step children of the /r/nfl community. Most fans recognize that we are no longer a bum team, but it will take time and more wins for other team fans to come around. We raped the Redskins in the magical ""RGIII trade"" so some of their fans get a little butt hurt with us (well that and we mercy ruled them this season). Because the Rams get into some brawls, you may see some flack from Seahawks and Giants fan flares in /r/nfl. Overall, however, we are viewed and pride ourselves in being very friendly and nice fans. We don't gloat, and usually beat ourselves up more than we should. Any rivalries within the division are almost purely ""friendly""...I'd say the only real harbor of hate is for the Patriots. 49ers beef goes way back into the 90s and we seem to be on friendly terms now, and the Seahawks beef is rather new given their powerhouse status and extra-annoying brand new bandwagon fans due to Superbowl success (some of the older fans are really cool and remember when the Seahawks sucked). I don't think we've ever been on bad terms with the Cardinals and tend to have nothing but respect for them."

He has proven he has a great arm and if Bradford proves to not be the perfect fit we would have an actual starter rather than above average backups
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,CarbonxGuitar,3,Wed Jan 21 20:52:29 2015 UTC,Ship a later pick out. This makes sense and would be an upgrade over the play of the last 2 seasons from the QB spot.

He's a product of that system. When they had more speed with Desean and the system was new, Foles didn't ever have to throw his receivers open. They already were open. This season he showed that he struggles anticipating his WRs out of their breaks and letting the ball fly before they get open."

StLouisRams,2t7gx3,BadAstronaut,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:32:30 2015 UTC,The lunacy of the Bradford apologists has really hit a tipping point.  I'm sure he's a really great guy but enough is enough. I was on board before last year but it's time to move on. Looking at where we're drafting and the current and soon to be FA QB market I would say that Foles offers the absolute best value available.    I just can't imagine a scenario in which we'd be able to trade up for Winston or Mariota.  As a UCLA fan I'd love to snag Hundley but 10 will likely be too high and I think his measurables lend himself to being off the board before we pick in the 2nd round considering other teams perceived QB needs.  If we were able to make a move for Foles with a 3rd or 4th rounder I'd be in favor.  I know we have limited picks this year but I implore you to check out the other options.  In my opinion Sam shouldn't be one.
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,vrock627,2,Wed Jan 21 21:57:18 2015 UTC,Foles wasnt that good this year...
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,BadAstronaut,0,Thu Jan 22 00:48:30 2015 UTC,"Best value available. Unless we're walking down the Jake Locker, Mark Sanchez or Christian Ponder path. Foles has produced at a high level in the NFL. Bradford has never for any extended time looked like the QB Foles was last year.  I just don't understand how you all cling to the idea that he's the answer?  Downvote me all you want I'm done being a Bradford apologist. The only solution is cutting him or a major restructure (why would he agree to that?)  I've said before I think Sam in the right system could be a productive QB but it's just not happening for us. He'll end up signing in KC or Pitt somewhere without a viable backup and given the chance he'll thrive. I just can't for the life of me make an argument for a guy who start of next season won't have taken a meaningful snap in 2 years."
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,vrock627,1 point,Thu Jan 22 01:25:56 2015 UTC,honestly foles is one of the most overrated players in the league. he wouldnt have much success on the rams. we dont really have the picks to give up for him either

StLouisRams,2t7gx3,BadAstronaut,0,Thu Jan 22 23:26:03 2015 UTC,"Great thanks for that stats based analysis. Fingers crossed our Management is using that kind of approach.  Once again, best available option with an actual track record of pro-level success."

StLouisRams,2t7gx3,price-iz-right,2,Thu Jan 22 16:41:26 2015 UTC,"This is all nonsense anyway. The organization will make the best move they can make to win. No one saw Bradford getting repeatedly injured. The team is still building and is also the youngest in the league. I can say with confidence that we are headed in the right direction, and we have been for the past 3 years. If they say Bradford is the guy then we just need to accept it as the way forward until it's time to change it up.   I, for one, want to see what a healthy Bradford can do for us (on a restructured contract). Pick up a rook in the draft and see what happens. Our biggest problem is our offensive line right now. No QB in the league could perform behind our line."
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,BadAstronaut,0,Thu Jan 22 17:07:56 2015 UTC,"I mean no shit. The point of this thread is speculation. Of course were going to rally around whatever team ends up on the field.  The thread wasn't what our biggest issue is, it's what does everyone think about Foles"
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,price-iz-right,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"I understand. I just feel it's a bit pointless to look at all these FA QBs when the Rams have already clearly stated that Bradford is the man next year? Shouldn't we be speculating FA Cs or RGs? Maybe even a T considering Long might not be coming back?  The team's clear issues right now are:  -who is going to be the offensive cordinator and what will that system be like?  -what are we going to do about the offensive line  I think the team has already addressed the QB situation. They are clearly bringing Bradford back and I think they are most likely going to draft a QB in a late round to coach up along with Davis.   Unless I'm missing something...have they pointed towards FA possibilites?   Also for every ""Bradford apologizer"" there is an equal ""Anyone but Bradford"" fan in these ridiculous arguments.   Bradford is perfectly fine for this team, if he stays healthy. I don't see the need in grabbing a FA. Long term we should be looking at rookies if he cannot come back 100%."
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,BadAstronaut,0,Thu Jan 22 21:37:35 2015 UTC,Well said moron.
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,vrock627,2,Thu Jan 22 21:58:19 2015 UTC,"im not a big stat geek, but a 13 to 10 TD;INT ratio is pretty bad compared to bradfords 14:4 last time he got a chance. many people blame the oline for foles struggles this year, but the oline he will have in STL would likely be worse. and we already traded a 4th and 6th rounder to TB so we are running low on picks, our draft class will be incredibly small if we trade even more away for foles.   edit: if we are going to throw picks at a QB i would rather we trade up for winston or mariota"
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,Ihateunerds,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:44:39 2015 UTC,"The good thing we have going for us is Bradford doesn't have any deadlines for roster bonuses or the like, so there's no date we'd have to cut him by. We could see how the draft plays out, and if somehow Winston falls to ten than we can cut Bradford after the draft.  Or we could trade for a QB like Foles and then cut Bradford. It's a nice benefit to have time to let the situation play out before making a final call on Bradford. Usually guys have like March 1 roster bonuses that force teams to make premature decisions. We could cut Bradford tomorrow or September 1st and it wouldn't make a difference cap-wise.  I think that's why they are in no rush to get his contract restructured anytime soon."
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,QSix23,-2,Thu Jan 22 21:35:16 2015 UTC,"id go in for him. Cut sam, get Foles, draft Mariota. Fuck chip kelly"
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,cshay33,-1,Thu Jan 22 23:30:56 2015 UTC,People are all over Foles because he can run Chip Kelly's offense.. MARK SANCHEZ was successful in that system.
StLouisRams,2t7gx3,BadAstronaut,2,Fri Jan 23 19:04:59 2015 UTC,Not at all true. People conveniently seem to forget how bad he was after the first two games which were incredible
StLouisRams,2t6pvx,Bmallar1,15,Wed Jan 21 16:59:35 2015 UTC,I thought the goal was to keep Bradford healthy?  Martz is a QB slaughtering machine.
StLouisRams,2t6pvx,rsmatt00,3,Wed Jan 21 18:01:02 2015 UTC,Haha have we reached that point?
StLouisRams,2t6pvx,BigMax55,9,Wed Jan 21 17:56:15 2015 UTC,Pls no   Any QB behind a good offensive line is gonna get hit a lot in the Martz offense.   A QB behind OUR offensive line in the Martz offense would be a death sentence.
StLouisRams,2t6pvx,OldOrder,6,Wed Jan 21 18:22:50 2015 UTC,"Although I would welcome it, it will never happen. Martz probably wouldn't want to come back anyway. We fucked that guy."

He turned un drafted Warner, Bulger and Kitna into Pro Bowlers. Unless you want another year of Schotty or a bunch of OC's I've seen not succeed, with better playmakers than we have, that's fine. I'm all for someone who's had wild success in this league. I'd rather have the chance to be really really good or really really bad than mediocre again."
StLouisRams,2t6pvx,bozo7337,0,Fri Jan 23 15:46:41 2015 UTC,So for those that want Martz is it because he's a good OC? Or is it because GSOT 2 is your goal? Also there is no way in hell he and Fisher can coexist.
StLouisRams,2t6pvx,BrawndoTTM,0,Wed Jan 21 19:30:52 2015 UTC,"He would make it maybe 5 minutes into the interview before cracking a joke about one yard short and being shown the door.  Seriously though, he isn't the answer. His offence is like Tampa Bay's defence during their SB run. Incredibly creative and impressive, but it requires like 5 HoF quality players at key positions in order to work. The lack of an elite LT alone would get Bradford killed in a Martz offence."
StLouisRams,2t6pvx,Nothing_exciting,0,Thu Jan 22 03:56:45 2015 UTC,"I would rather bring back Al Saunders. He has had his ups and downs but during his ups I'm not sure that many were better. His first run with us was during GSOT days, he then was OC of the Chiefs during their good years. He is based more as a run first which is what we need. During is second time with us it was one of the worst offenses in the league but I think it was more personal than coaching. That line was worse than our current one in my opinion. The only lineman worth noting was a past his prime frail Pace. Starting receivers were Avery and Holt having his worst year arguably ever."
StLouisRams,2t52ej,hb_alien,16,Wed Jan 21 05:12:11 2015 UTC,"For fuck's sake. I hate that teams can stop their coaches from interviewing for what is undeniably a promotion, even if it's not to HC."

StLouisRams,2t52ej,BigMax55,3,Wed Jan 21 14:53:27 2015 UTC,Yikes. I feel like Manning made Gase. Not the other way around. That would kind of suck.
StLouisRams,2t52ej,Sinisterminister77,1 point,Wed Jan 21 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"Manning may have made Gase but for sure Gase did not make Manning.  Archie probably did more to make Peyton, literally and figuratively, than any coach.  But I still think Gase is a good OC.  Bradford isn't Manning and our WRs are not Denver's WRs but at least Gase has run a very successful offense.  He just might be the best of what's left.  I would be comfortable with that hire, even excited, which I wouldn't be if our new OC was a WR or TE coach.  If Gase hasn't proven himself then who has?"

StLouisRams,2t52ej,New_DudeToo,0,Wed Jan 21 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"This is what is so frustrating, the way Fisher and Snead tend to drag their feet instead of acting quickly.   Instead of getting a top name OC we'll most likely get someone off the scrap heap or promote a position coach and keep our fingers crossed.  Fuck!  The defense is ready now, Snisher should hire a real OC who can completely take over the offense -- even if that means abandoning ""Fisher's style of offense"" which has been about as successful an offense as you'd expect from a defensive coach.  Does he not know his own limitations?  Does he not want competition for the HC job down the line (we know Williams will probably never be a HC candidate after 'bountygate')?  Why declare that the offense won't change -- does that help with the search for a good OC or does it hurt it?  How many good candidates read that and immediately rejected any idea of coming to the Rams and being handcuffed into using Schotty's system?  It seems like they do so many right things with the defense and then bungle so much with the offense, including this hire.   I hope I'm wrong and the next OC is a superstar but I'm getting very skeptical.   Well whatever we get, retread or rookie, I hope they get the team ready to play by week 1.  I'm so tired of the team looking out of sync and unprepared until a month or more into the season."
