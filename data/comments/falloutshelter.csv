I basically took the stud farm approach to breeding. When one of my high stat explorers would return I'd send him to the living quarters and then send a parade of depressed women to him to find happiness. Once most were pregnant - I'd send him back out on the road. Lather, rinse, repeat.   If a challenge came up that was baby related I'd occassionally just use my unhappiest dwellers and give them pick me up bootie calls to fulfill the challenge.   Haven't had much of an issue with incest so far - but then again I periodically take my weakest folks on coffee break and send them 'exploring' to make room for fresh blood."
falloutshelter,3dipfg,boomhaeur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:03:14 2015 UTC,"2) Expecting mother seem to do just fine when they are put back to work.  The exception is they will run away during any incidents, so it isn't a good idea to have only expecting mothers in a room."
falloutshelter,3dipfg,PeacekeepingTroops,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:11:42 2015 UTC,"1) I tend to use new outside dwellers with neutral stats for mates with someone with the special stat I want. This widens the gene pool and the child has a higher chance of getting the stat I want. Babies will randomly choose the highest natural stat of one of the parents. To avoid Incest, I give the surname of the opposite sexed parent  2) I put mothers back to work wherever they work but make sure not to have more than 2 pregnant women in a 3-wide and only 1 if less wide. *Exception: No women in the first raided room i.e. right after the vault door.  3) Kids are useless, plan accordingly. If you have too many kids they will drain your resources so don't more than you can handle. I tend to max out at 4 that way I know where I can put the children when they grow up.  4) I'm not sure about family, I've heard a rumour that having mixed gendered rooms helps happiness though."
falloutshelter,3dipfg,chrisq518,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:10:03 2015 UTC,"I just randomly select parents. Sometimes I will use one of my special high stat dwellers, but it doesn't seem to make much difference now that I have skill training rooms.   Inbreeding is tracked by the game and is not allowed, but I don't know what the exact rules are other than no children/parent or brother/sister sex. I am building a vault now to test this out. I will keep tight control of the breeding and track it through several generations while testing who will have sex with who. I don't think the surnames matter, but I will test this also.   2.Put the moms to work. They don't seem to be affected except in emergencies when they run away.   I don't like to have more than 4 at one time and I wait for the kids to grow before another round of pregnancies. You have to be careful because kids use food/water but don't make any resources. Too many kids at once can kill a vault. 3.Can't do anything with them except let them wander around until they are adults. 4. Not that I have noticed."

Good job, I wish they mentioned about the format(but I guess the fun is finding the most optimal) because I also fucked up majorly. 4-5 floors down my right side was a complete mess.

falloutshelter,3dcrdx,thehymen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:59:02 2015 UTC,I ended up using the right side (two-blocks) for storage & training rooms and tried to keep my power to the left side... goal was to try and ensure less essential rooms were the ones that lost power first if I got crunched.

I mostly used the right side for when I'm running low on resources and or need to put extra dwellers. Ended up scratching the entire right side to re-do my base. I'm at the point where I'm starting to replace diners and water things with the garden and nuclear reactor.

falloutshelter,3cbhux,latca,3,Mon Jul 6 18:55:09 2015 UTC,Everyone in my vault has a weapon with the min dmg of 6 or higher. Mostly sawed of shotguns and rusty laser pistols.

All 6 dwellers in the power plant have armor and the strongest guns that my vault owns.  Raiders always come in the vault door, ramble into the elevator, ride down one flight and exit the left. The 3 raiders die in the power plant. I check on the workers and hand out stimpaks for good behavior!   The raiders haven't made it past the power plant in a week or more."
falloutshelter,3cbhux,justanavrgguy,3,Mon Jul 6 20:26:35 2015 UTC,"Same here, except for the room type.  I have a water pump station so that way all the raiders encounter my guys with the highest Perception, which I hope helps with the gunfire."

falloutshelter,3cbhux,unl33t,6,Tue Jul 7 18:27:21 2015 UTC,"I keep the best weapons for my explorers since it seems to determine the strongest enemies they can kill in the wasteland, whereas a regular 3-4 damage weapon on your vault guards is enough to handle raiders if you use med packs."
falloutshelter,3cbhux,Statisfaction,8,Mon Jul 6 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"I've got two max lvl 50 dudes with hardened flamers at the entrance. Raiders can't make it through that room.   As far as other dwellers, they ALL get a lower level weapon that has at least a 4 damage stat, every other weapon I sell that is not at least 4. Weapons above 14 or so go to my explorers.   Furthermore, anyone in a production room gets an outfit boosting the stat needed for the room. e.g. everyone in my nuclear reactor gets a military uniform (or whatever it's called) that boosts strength by 3. Even if you are at 10 strength, the additional stats will lower the resource production time. You can see the modifiers if you click on a dweller, then click the special. It will open up another screen with a + next to the stat that the outfit has a direct effect on.  If a dweller is just in a stat training room, they wear the standard vault gear, but they are armed.    Also, if an explorer comes back with a particularly bountiful weapon/armor load, I will let them mate with a hot chick that has high charisma. Then I'll send said pregnant hot chick out to the wasteland to die as a sacrifice to the wasteland as thanks for the equipment."

falloutshelter,3cbhux,flancresty,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"Once you have a steady stream of explorers going in and out (10+ each way) you'll need to equip all your dwellers w/ clothing and a weapon or you'll have inventory problem/sell good stuff. And of course the stat bonuses for clothing help with production.  But I've never had radroach issues with dwellers all equipped with rusty laser pistol or sawed off shotguns. That's the minimum weapon in my vault, which I slowly upgrade as new gear comes in."
falloutshelter,3cbhux,SpagNMeatball,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:49:11 2015 UTC,"I was following the same strategy as you. A dweller only gets a weapon when they head to the wasteland or when radroaches appear. However, as I have moved above 100 dwellers, the performance is a little laggy and its hard to get to the room and assign the weapons in time. I had a roach infestation that killed 12 dwellers because the game was lagging so bad I could not get guns assigned in time.   My new policy is that everyone gets a gun. I mostly hand out .32s, 10mm and shotguns. One guy in every room has some thing better like an assault rifle.   I always have 3 guys in the wasteland searching for weapons and armor. I can equip everyone in the vault with a weapon and an outfit at this point."

You can try to read your iPhone crash reports, mine are usually do to lack of memory (even though nothing is open). I find zooming all the way out actually makes my game crash more often. Also, I give the game a lot of time to load my explorers page... If I try to click before the details load (what they fought, caps...) all the way, if always crashes. Good luck."
falloutshelter,3c9ayx,CorpseHeiress,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:03:56 2015 UTC,I have the same phone and had the same problem. I had to kill them off until I had below 150 dwellers. At 200 I couldn't do anything. I found that zooming into an empty room before opening up your character list helped me be able to select dead people in the wasteland and remove them. I could only do one or two at a time before it crashed but it got easier and easier the more I removed. Now I keep under 150 and it never crashes.
falloutshelter,3c9ayx,criblo,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:30:18 2015 UTC,It's a memory issue.  The only thing you can do is what I do - keep your vault at 18 people and only keep the needed rooms.

I lag enough trying to equip them with weapons or armor so having 200 might be over the top.   Adding on, what I would like for an expansion is having control of multiple vaults at once. Then having the dweller the ability to go to said vault and clear then capture them. Also a way to turn of the 3D thing. It's cool and all but that thing kills battery."

Send them back to the wasteland and it'll let you assign another 25.

So I sent him out again, giving him 25 this time as well. When I checked on his progress in the wasteland, I noticed that he had 50.  I wonder if you need to force-close the app after hitting ""explore"" but before they actually exit the vault. I'll experiment and see what I can come up with."

falloutshelter,3c87z7,guildymaster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:08:40 2015 UTC,"Basically this is how this works:  You send an person out to explore, and load them w/ 25 stimpacks. Before they get to the door, an incident occurs, can be radroaches or fire from rushing, a raider attack, whatever. You divert the explorer to deal with the incident. Once the incident ends, the explorer ""forgets"" what she was doing and starts wandering around on a coffee break. She's secretly holding the 25 stims you assigned her. You can send her out again, load her up w/ 25 more stims and she'll embark into the wastes with 50."

falloutshelter,3bkho9,SpagNMeatball,2,Mon Jun 29 23:29:40 2015 UTC,What's so bad about a single room? They may cost more to upgrade but three small rooms still holds as many people as one large room.
falloutshelter,3bkho9,guildymaster,3,Tue Jun 30 03:17:26 2015 UTC,"Correct. Supposedly the larger rooms are ""more efficient"" but nobody has quantified that yet. And like you said, they cost less to upgrade so in the early stages when caps are scarce, it makes sense to combine. And it looks a little nicer with combined rooms."
falloutshelter,3bkho9,TinDragon,3,Tue Jun 30 05:07:18 2015 UTC,"So assume a single room costs 300 to upgrade. Having two rooms together and upgrading them will only cost you 450 for those two rooms combined, which is 150 cheaper than upgrading two individual rooms. Upgrading three together would cost you 525.  They aren't exact numbers, but that's basically the biggest advantage you get (at least that I've seen): upgrading merged rooms is cheaper than upgrading individually."
falloutshelter,3bkho9,me_sk1nk,2,Wed Jul 1 03:30:07 2015 UTC,"Same goes for production. Two single rooms produce  20 each, joined together they get you 48 (not exact, but there is a benefit, you can see this easily with the stimpack production ... One room produces 1, 2 joined together produce 3, so it's more efficient in terms of production/worker)... I always get 2 columns of  3 joined production rooms and on the right a 2 joined room for storage, like barracks or storage rooms, sometimes the upgrade rooms as well since they don't benefit from larger size other than in upgrade costs."

falloutshelter,3bgqfg,Protector12,5,Mon Jun 29 02:04:23 2015 UTC,Endurance helps your dwellers survive in the wasteland. Pair that with luck to increase the rate of them finding better weapons/armor.   Also is the main attribute off your Nuka-Cola rooms - which produce both water and food.
falloutshelter,3bgqfg,Jrrolomon,4,Mon Jun 29 15:46:39 2015 UTC,Well gee thanks. I actually had no clue it made food AND water. That makes training for endurance worth it.

Also a way to pause so we don't get lag especially when trying to get weapon or clothes to a dweller when you have 150 other dwellers doing stuff in the background. An option to not magnify when dwellers are about to have sex, have a baby, or a fire/rad-roaches."

falloutshelter,3bbuv4,mCopps,3,Sat Jun 27 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"The best way to get items is to level up your dwellers and train all their stats.  I have 10 maxed SPECIAL traits dwellers and they're all level 50s. I average 1-3 +10 atk weapons a trip and 10-15k caps, not adding in the things I sell. They can last up to 3 days and 12 hours with 25 stimpacks and 25 radaways but they don't even use the radaways, so i'm doing 5-10 a trip now. From what I have gathered currently the best attack weapon I've gotten are plasma rifle (17-18). So with this conclusion 20+ weapons are from lunchboxes, or is a very, very low chance to get from the wasteland. I have not really tested it, but they can go over the 10 stat cap for SPECIAL. I always get 15k+ caps on a dweller with a +7 luk clothing, and the ones with 4+ extra endurance can last over the others death times.   Yes, I did ""cheat"". I put the date to Jan 1, 2015 before starting the vault. Now I'm at May.  I also have a vault with 65 lunchboxes doing the objective loop exploit. Its set to Jan 1, 2010. Its at Jan 5th atm.

If you're talking about dwellers within the room you can't really change it. Its based on how many people are there and when you put them there.

Overall room positioning, my most successful shelter, packing 50k+ caps a day, over 30 explorers with ridiculous stats and level 30+. Has 10 floors purely resource. The very top floor is living quarters. Then after that is (P(Power), D(Diner), W(Water), E(Elevator)) a simple PPP E DDD WW. Then change diners and waters with one another. After getting tons of caps change the Middle to Nuka Cola, and the far right to Nuclear and the Power to Nuclear. 10 Rooms should be enough to support the rest.

It's like the stupid claims that Fallout 4 will be anti-homosexual because you can't choose to have a homosexual relationship in the beginning, it's just a cool way to choose your characters gender in game, that's all, people are too worried about little meaningless crap and not excited enough (or worried enough beforehand) about what happened today, who gives a fuck if your digital character can't be in a gay marriage for like 15 minutes of a video game (with good reason) when actual, real life people can't marry the person they love.  TL:DR yes, vaults are really homophobic for good reason, long rant."

falloutshelter,3b8z6e,squintus,4,Fri Jun 26 23:06:35 2015 UTC,You need weapons. Send 2 dwellers out at a time equipped with as many radaways and stim packs as you have. After a few hours they should have 4-5 weapons each.
falloutshelter,3b8z6e,7thDrunknPirate,3,Fri Jun 26 23:40:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip. I kind of just figured this out. I had a couple good weapons but not enough in each room. Also, all my dwellers had only half health going into it so I probably shouldn't of rushed a room when everyone was less than 10% happiness and half dead haha. Thanks again"
falloutshelter,3b8z6e,SpagNMeatball,3,Fri Jun 26 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"Thats the key that I discovered recently. Do not rush a room when your resources and health is low. Fire is OK, but radroaches can kill everyone.   I usually don't have the dwellers armed, but as soon as I see an infestation, I rush to the room and arm everyone. When people go to the wasteland they get a gun, when they come back they give it up. It easier to keep the armory stocked that way and move the strongest weapons to where they are needed the most.   I almost always have at lest one dweller exploring the wasteland. I seem to get better stuff by sending dwellers with high E and L and leaving them out for around 3 hours. Past 3 hours they always seem to die."
falloutshelter,3b8z6e,boomhaeur,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:14:14 2015 UTC,"Nice that's a great idea actually to not actually have them equipped at all times and to just do it on a need basis. And yeah I was actually wondering which skills made for better wasteland wanders. I had a dweller with full agility and noticed that he fired a gun faster. Or it could have been my imagination. But either way thanks for the tip, I'll for sure being using that one along with keeping a guy out in the wastelands"
falloutshelter,3b7djg,pdeluc99,6,Fri Jun 26 15:49:23 2015 UTC,It lowers happiness if you rush too often in the same room.

falloutshelter,3b4sk1,DoubleDonkDiddyKong,7,Thu Jun 25 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"Sure. I am doing okay about to crack 100 residents, and no resource issues.   Basic strat Active play means more and faster resource generation (and your battery will die). So stay in game and collect the resources as they spawn.  Don't expand population too fast. At the start you can find yourself jumping significant population percentages (ie pop of 20 and then 5 pregnant dwellers, increase of resource requirement would be about 25% but kids cannot work so they put nothing back into the vault).  Rooms Have a plan for the vault layout. Can just be simple:- RRRERRRERR (R=Room and E=Elevator) means it is simple to get around but I maximise my potential triple rooms.   The more rooms you have the more expensive a new one is. So if remodeling destroy the old one first and then build the new one. I did this with the training rooms and saved about 400 caps per room.   Upgrade the most essential rooms, this depends on how your base is going. Each room can be upgraded 3 times. With the second tier of room this 3rd upgrade costs more than building a whole new room. So consider that when looking at efficiency.  Dwellers Try and match them to their Perfect job. Mainly their best stat when they are born or come in from the wilderness.   They can be trained in all SPECIAL stats and I have been pretty successful in sequentially levelling my dwellers i.e. All my power plant workers were trained to 2, then 3... And this was very effective at pulling up all my production times.  Equipping the Dwellers! I would recommend 2 people per room (minimum) to be armed.  Any outfits should enhance their primary job stat and then what ever there after to look good or boost income.  Bad Stuff Raiders: they will enter the base and then head straight forward (along the top row).  Have 2 armed people in every room, including the entrance, and medkits and you should be okay.  I upgraded door very quickly to give me time to move my people into place.  RadRoach Armed people in every room. Drag more armed people to the room.  If you do not get to them quickly they will spread to other rooms.  Fire Have people in or near every room. Can also spread.   Misc. Sending people to the wilderness. Send them for as long as possible, till they have almost nothing left and are a glowing remnant of a human. The dweller can carry up to 25 med and rad paks. So make sure you can supply everyone who you send out.  Missions Skip ones you cannot do, but try and do every lunch box one as they bring le phat lewts.   Good luck."

falloutshelter,3b4sk1,hosalabad,3,Fri Jun 26 13:57:23 2015 UTC,"Build slowly and endtask when you aren't going to be playing for more than a while.  The training and exploring still happens, but all of the other tasks finish one round and hold.  This way every time you open the game all of the food/water/power isn't burned up."
